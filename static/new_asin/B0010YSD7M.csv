3056955,5,B0010YSD7M,"This movie is much better than I ever anticipated, even with my high expectations. The scope of the higher budget than a regular episode is clearly visible.

Everyone shoud do as I do, and buy a DVD, in order to prove to everyone in the business that Stargate SG-1 isn't dead. The series must go on, in any form possible.",1199404800,17,321,4.35
3056956,1,B0010YSD7M,"I have never been more disappointed with this series since I started purchasing the DVD sets several years ago. My entire experience with this series has been through the DVD releases and while I have enjoyed most of the seasons, there have been more than their fair share of poorly produced episodes, yet I've stuck with the series.

Having purchased every set of the Stargate SG-1 series as well as Stargate Atlantis, I was amped up when I purchased this DVD, the final battle with the Ori and never, in my life, have I been so disappointed in this series than I have with Stargate: The Ark of Truth.

First off, MGM had overhyped this release to death giving fans of the series the impression that this was the end all battle with the Ori. After finally purchasing this DVD I was so severely disappointed with the movie that I felt robbed of the $18 I had spent on it.

Instead of getting a feature length movie of SG1's battle with the Ori, we're treated to an hour and ten minutes (1:10) of battle with the Replicators. The Ori are nowhere to be seen with the small exception of the opening of the movie as well as the ending of the movie during the final battle with Adria.

While I'm not dismissing the series at all, I would suggest that if you're thinking about buying this movie, don't. Save your money. Hopefully, the next project due out from MGM will save the series: Stargate: Continuum.",1199145600,10,1401,4.482352941176471
3056957,5,B0010YSD7M,This movie will be awesome of the two that will be released so far. This show should have never been canclled and when we buy this movie and the next all of us will use our support to have MGM sign for more Stargate SG-1 movies.,1198886400,10,228,3.9782608695652173

Like most loyal Stargate SG-1 fans, I firmly believe that this show could have continued, at least for one more season.  But MGM's greed and SCiFi's poor management  forced it off the air before its time (yes, I'm talking about you Bonnie...how you worked out in your head that ECW wrestling belongs on the SciFi Channel remains a huge mystery to everyone).  I am glad that the powers that be have at least seen fit to provide us with this and the next Stargate movie and I hope that they will be the first of many.",1198627200,174,685,5.495238095238095

3056962,4,B0010YSD7M,"""Stargate: The Ark Of Truth"" is first Stargate SG-1 Direct-To-DVD film. It also is the film which closes the Ori stary arc initially begun at the beginning of it's 9th Season (""Avalon"" Parts 1 & 2 and ""Origin"").

I have been looking forward to this film for some time given it's placement within the Stargate Timeline. Even though Atlantis S4 is currently airing, and Samantha Carter is now the base commander (""Reunion""), in fact, this film takes place some time before Atlantis' Season 3 finale ""First Strike.""",1197158400,17,512,4.885057471264368

3056968,5,B0010YSD7M,"I'm glad they actually ended it this way, wrapping everything up very nicely. The storyline was actually more engaging than any Hollywood movie I've seen in recent years, but that's probably because it could focus on the story as we already know the characters and general background.

The pacing was just fantastic, as were the performances and effects. The only downside is you'd have to see the last couple seasons of SG-1 to follow. Which you should.",1518048000,,454,4.896103896103896

3056971,5,B0010YSD7M,"Nicely wrapping up the events from seasons 9 and 10 of the series, this movie is among my most cherished. The series that spawned it has become one of my most beloved collections. The story line with the Ori and the fight against single-mindedly-determined fundamentalist analogs was thrilling to watch unfold.  My favorite part is the final confrontation between Adria and Morgan le Fay. Though it more or less rehashes a similar battle between Anubis and Oma de Sala, the scene is, even so, remarkable.

True, the movie rushes to a conclusion as it tries to tie everything together. Originally, this story was to have been the entire 11th season of the show, but other factors intervened. Nevertheless, I love the movie and feel that it captures the best of humanity: resilience, hard work, commitment, even faith. The soundtrack is phenomenal.",1514592000,,846,4.99290780141844

3056980,4,B0010YSD7M,"This is the ending to the SG-1 series that you didn't get in the series finale. If you've watched all 10 seasons of SG-1 you really have to watch the Ark of Truth as it brings closure to the whole Ori story line, which was the essential driving plot of the final 2 seasons of the series.

It's basically just a 90 minute episode of SG-1 with a slightly higher production value. It flows well with the series. They don't do anything stupid like change actors, add major characters, or change the visual look of the show like you saw in Star Trek The Motion Picture, which only mildly resembled the original Star Trek.

They use the same sets, props, actors, etc as the TV show. It flows perfectly with it.  It's not the greatest ending of all time, but it's a good closure to the Ori story line.

However if you've only seen the original Stargate movie with Kurt Russel, you should NOT watch Ark of Truth. You will have no idea what's going on. This is not a movie you can watch without having see at least the final 2 seasons of Stargate SG-1. As it's a direct continuation of the plot of the show you will be totally lost.",1499299200,,1123,4.283018867924528

3057001,3,B0010YSD7M,"First of all, I think i should say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. I really liked the Ori story arc and was interested to see what became of the Orici and Tomin etc. In terms of a LONG EPISODE to tie up this arc, it was spot on.

But this wasn't a long episode to end the Ori story arc. This was the SG1 MOVIE.

It should have included more from the series, at large. Why didn't we get a chance to revisit the Nox in this movie? They were one of the original four great races, they could have helped in some way. There must have been some surviving Tollan, what about bringing one of them on? Somebody could have run into Maybourne. Where the hell was Jack? WHY DIDN'T HE NAIL CARTER IN THIS MOVIE? Even a random fallen system lord trying to regain some kind of power would have been a fun little throwback. Maybe a random baal clone still wandering around.

On the one hand, I get that the movie was a continuation of where the series left off. Fine. But on the other hand, IT IS A MOVIE THAT IS MEANT TO END A LONG RUNNING SERIES and really should have encompassed more of the characters and arcs that made this series great.",1480291200,,1128,4.118181818181818

I must say, however, the very last episode was so well done, so bittersweet an end, that it is kind of hard to top it, and Ark of Truth, while a great movie for SG-1 fans like yours truly, just doesn't match the quality of the last episode. I would've liked to have seen cameos from earlier episodes, and a little more creativity from the writers.

I wish I could give it 3 1/2.

I really enjoy Stargate SG-1, and enjoy all of it, including this film. My only two issues...

1. The score is excessive. I get it. It's a movie. It's going to get a movie score. But after 10 seasons of the television show without one, you'd think they could have made an exception. It's always in the background. It's constant. It actually is distracting.

2. The replicator story arc is also extremely excessive. It's unnecessary. The story of the Ori was perfectly sufficient. The story arc with the replicators leads me to believe that the writers were unable to come up with enough on the Ori side to actually make a full length feature film. If that's the case, they shouldn't have made it. Not only does it feel cheap, but it feels poorly done.

Nonetheless... It's still a fun way to kill some time. And for SG-1 fans, still worth the watch.",1468195200,,906,4.5

So every year, SG-1 always wrapped up their main plotline... because they always figured they'd be canceled. And every year they were pleasantly surprised when they weren't canceled.

When they were finally actually canceled, they weren't expecting it. So they made two movies to tie up the plotlines that Season 11 would have wrapped up. Ark of Truth is the better of the two.",1456876800,,598,4.579439252336448

This war is perpetrated by those who would demand worship and call themselves gods, who were in fact, nothing more than very highly evolved humans.

3057118,3,B0010YSD7M,"I figure if you are going to watch it then it's because you got to the end of the regular series, another meh installment in the series IMO, then you are already committed to seeing this.  I'm a huge SG1 fan so know that I am writing this review from an informed and non-bashing POV.

Ark of Truth as a series finale is fair. Not nearly the best adventure finale for the series by any stretch but it did have some great moments. Just don't pay too close attention to the details. Several characters are dropped in with little more than exposition for dialog. And many coda of the series are simply ignored in order to move the plot along. Also, there are a lot of drawn out scenes that just take up time and budget - an extended fight that involves Mitchell and a trek taken by Teal'c together eat up 10 minutes of this 90-minute film.

However as lazy as one of the major plot points is, it is a great twist and you don't see it coming. The overall suspense is just doom-y enough to carry you through to the end so it is worth it, but just barely.",1430611200,2,1048,4.178217821782178

3057220,1,B0010YSD7M,"This review is only for those (1) who have never seen stuff from the Stargate franchise and (2) Amazon recommends the movie to them.  This rating is based solely on these two factors

This film was ""recommend"" to me by Amazon, and since I generally enjoy good science fiction movie and it was free, I gave it a go.

First and foremost, it is not a standalone movie -- instead it is an end of series wrap-up made for TV movie.  It plops you down at the end of a large story arc and gives you no backstory to get you up to speed.  You get to follow around the characters through contrived subplots that ""magically"" all get resolved simultaneously at the end.  Furthermore, the character are not developed over the course of the movie and the plot continually references previous events outside the storyline.

Judging by the positive reviews, a fan who already invested with the characters and is in tune with the arc of the franchise will lap this up.  But for anyone who is not, this is not the movie to start with.

In other words, IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY A STARGATE FAN, AVOID THIS FILM. IGNORE AMAZON's RECOMMENDATION OF THE FILM TO YOU.  START WITH SOMETHING ELSE IN THE STARGATE SERIES.  Notwithstanding, if you are a Stargate fan, you might enjoy it.",1404777600,,1255,4.484581497797357

Just like Teal'c said at the end of this movie, there are a lot more planets that haven't been explored. There could have been all kinds of stories for the writers to do. They should have never made Stargate Universe series. It wasn't very good. They could have put that money and talent into 2 or 3 more seasons of Sg1.

Production quality was D grade. Whomever did the special effects knew what they were doing, but whoever did the lighting (especially in the second act) was horrible. Some camera movements were unnecessarily shaky.
My general impression is that this was made to wrap up the story line of the series as quickly as possible to get it out of the way - on what looks like less than an episode budget.

3057263,3,B0010YSD7M,"As a die hard fan of the Stargate franchise, I loved the opening scenes and credits of this movie...right up until the CGI took over. The villagers in the basement with the ark are discussing the morality of changing peoples' beliefs, even if those beliefs were false to begin with. Even though they could correct the cult's influence over the people, they couldn't do it without exercising the same mind control that the Ori cult did. But instead of casting exotic looking people, they hired mostly white Americans. The CGI of the ship leaving the snow-capped mountains ruined, in my opinion, the opening shots of the real mountains and the real snow.

Summary:

The film is the conclusion of Stargate SG-1's Ori arc, and picks up after the SG-1 series finale, but takes place before the fourth season of Stargate Atlantis.  SG-1 discovers a box that they believe contains the Ark while digging on Dakara, but before they can open it, Ori soldiers arrive, led by Tomin. Daniel tricks them into opening the box, but it is revealed to be a fake. When Tomin is ordered by a Prior to kill them, he refuses, and Mitchell kills the Prior, whose powers were being blocked by the Anti-Prior device. Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender.  When the Ark is activated and opened, the Doci is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers. With Adria now in a weakened state, Morgan is able to engage her in an eternal battle. SG-1 exposes the Prior on Earth to the Ark, transmitting the knowledge about the Ori to all of the Priors in the Milky Way, and thus turning all known Priors in the Universe.",1362096000,,1110,4.3478260869565215

This movie was enjoyable to watch, however I found some of the aspects of the story line somewhat cheesy. Bringing back the replicators might have been OK if it wasn't for the cheesy replicator-infected guy who seemed more like a bad ripoff of the Terminator than anything related to Stargate SG-1.

Stargate: Continuum was also good.

Stargate: The Ark of Truth, however is just plain terrible.
The central piece of this movie is the Ark of Truth, but we never are never led to understand it, and it is never really explained.
It is simply a magic wand used to tie together a plot which has plenty of progression, but no purpose or direction.

3057337,2,B0010YSD7M,"At some point, though always fuzzy, there needs to be a reasonable respect for physics and the rules laid down in the past- as well as common sense.  From Adria's zeroth hour revival (being twice completely vulnerable), 50 caliber machine guns relentlessly pounding away within our hero's spaceship without inflicting more devastating damage to the ship from within than the threat from without, Teal'c taking two staff blasts, defeating a host of jafa, pummeled relentlessly by his arch enemy and suddenly finding the strength to achieve a super human victory, Sam and Daniel solving impossible technical problems instantaneously and repeatedly when all hangs in the balance....it all defies this rule.  It always bothered me that they never addressed the infrastructure needed to maintain and build the technologies they were using.  In Arc of Truth, the plot descends into a pathetic string of melodrama that pained me to watch.  The last two seasons followed this recipe, sadly.  If they took the time to tell the story and let each encounter be solved in a 'reasonable' way through hard-won, incremental and reasonable experiences and adventures it would pass the test. But, sadly, the Arc of Truth left me with an A__ in Pain.

I can't help but retain my appreciation for the first 8 seasons and the wonderful characters and adventures to which I was treated.  I was happy to hang out with Teal'c and Daniel again and SG-1 will forever be one of my favorites.  I guess the team producing this just got tired of it.  In retrospect, the show should have been stopped at season 8.",1346803200,,1583,4.921052631578948

Cons: When first purchased this Blu-Ray in late 2008, I found there was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) lockout that prevented some players (including mine) from playing the disc even though everything was fully updated at the time.  Fast forward to 2012.... I decided to buy the Blu-Ray again, figuring 4 years is long enough for a new master to get into circulation.  No such luck.  I even bought a 2nd used copy hoping for a different batch.  Same problem.

To be specific, the Mastering error (or intentional) locks out Cyberlink PowerDVD 10, 11 and ArcSoft Total Media players, even if they are updated to patches dated 2012 which is well past this title's release date.  What you get is an annoying red ""update your player"" & "" we are not responsible..."" disclaimer screen. (See below). When you go to the URL on the screen, all it does is takes you to a general Blu-Ray advisory site which links the same updates you can get from the Player manufacturer's own web sites.  I had one tech support rep suggest I could try buying another player, but I think that's out of the question at $60 and up with no guarantee it would work.

It's also disturbing that Lt. Col Mitchell gets the lead the command when Carter has been there the longest. Also, the writer chose to divide SG1 into 3 separate units during their off world crisis. Special effects are ok, but nothing more extrordinary than what we see on the tv show. This could have been a 2parter on SciFi Channel instead.

Mainly because I was getting tired of the Goa'uld plot, but I had no idea at the time that they were going to introduce a new villain, one that was even better: the Ori! Lucky this DVD has a 9-minute recap of previous events both on the special features and on the movie itself. You can choose between watching the movie with the recap or without. And it's a good thing too, at least for me, or I would have been totally lost. But thanks to the recap, I was able to enjoy the movie to its full potential. So even if you haven't been keeping up with the show, you can still enjoy it.

An epic action-packed film with a great plot. SG-1 is looking for an ancient artifact called the Ark of Truth that can help them defeat the Ori once and for all. But their mission will not be easy. Apart from facing danger from the Ori, they must also deal with a double-crossing I.O.A. operative on board the Odyssey as well as an army of lethal Replicators. But will their efforts be in vain? Even if they manage to find the Ark, will they find it in time to prevent the Ori from wiping out Earth's entire population?

3057351,2,B0010YSD7M,"I'm a fan of Stargate, and a HUGE fan of seasons 9 and 10.  Obviously I had high expectations for this, but unfortunately they weren't met at ALL.  The writing was just terrible.  I mean it would be okay for a decent action movie, but by Stargate standards it was garbage.

Everything was stilted, things (like the Ori, the Priors, the Orisi) that were scary as hell in the series were kind of boring and/or goofy seeming in this.  The wonderful chemistry between the cast felt completely absent.  Vala and Sam barely have a part-Sam's reduced to a handful of tech lines, Vala has to spew a few paragraphs of boring exposition (she's an amazing actor...but how do you strike the write tone for that character while reading...paragraphs of boring exposition?)  The only one who really gets a decent amount of screen time is Cam.

We have a generic, unbelievable bureaucrat, like they're saying ""hey, remember those awful bureaucrats we've seen on Stargate?  He's like them!""  We have a shift of loyalties that comes out of the blue, and doesn't seem to have any connection at all to how the character was ALWAYS portrayed.

Heck, even the 'dialing the gate' scene was done 1000x better at the end of ""Unending"".

I'm really not sure how to rate this.  I didn't hate it, but it's a huge disappointment, and doesn't do the series justice at all.  To the people who seem to have only watched this movie and are judging the series by that-start at the beginning, or at the beginning of season 9.

3057355,4,B0010YSD7M,"Longtime fan.  Loved the show.

Although ""The Ark of Truth"" was released in March 2008, I held off watching it until October 2009, primarily to savor what few unviewed SG-1 adventures were left to me.  It was a thrill being back with the SG-1 team as it engaged the Ori one last time.

The movie plays like a long episode of ""Stargate SG-1,"" with improved special effects and somewhat of a double storyline (i.e. two threats to SG-1, earth, the galaxy, et cetera).  The usual SG-1 team banter is present along with its typical locations of operation: Cheyenne Mountain, forests and space as well as various planets and Ori strongholds.

Villain #1 is obviously the Ori and its minions.  When Villain #2 appears, we get somewhat of a regurgitated storyline from a later SG-1 season.  It didn't particularly bother me, but I thought I'd point it out.  I won't reveal Villain #2's identity, but let you discover it for yourself.

Another issue is that SG-1 is--once again--reliant on acquiring and implementing Ancient technology (the Ark of Truth) in order to defeat the Ori.  This lends yet another god-from-the-machine-like aspect to the tale, where SG-1 must merely hustle about with lots of derring-do until it finally deploys the technology in a nick-of-time scenario.

On to the cast.  Michael Shanks looks somewhat chunkier, but not as much he does in season two of ""Burn Notice.""  Christopher Judge has grown even more hair.  Amanda Tapping, Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Gary Jones and Beau Bridges all look about the same.

Overall, an enjoyable adventure.  If more SG-1 is what you want, this shouldn't disappoint.",1256083200,,1621,4.944444444444445

I just couldn't get used to the Atlantis series and wish we saw more direct to DVD movies with the originals.

This one had more of the same aliens for the conclusion.  I'd like to see more in the way of the personal relationships the characters have after being part of the SG-1 program.  We didn't get to see a lot of what happened to Richard Dean Anderson's character, and It would have been nice to see how he copes with his new environment as General O'Neil.",1249603200,,743,4.24822695035461

The only episodes I didn't like were the 100th (Wormhole Extreme) and the 200th - and even these had a few good moments.  So when I say I was disappointed in ""The Ark of Truth,"" I say that as someone who greatly appreciates almost every aspect of this show.  I think I may have expected too much from this movie.  When the Ori story arc began, it not only breathed new life into the show, it created an expectation of almost non-stop excitement.  Each new Ori-related episode kept the excitement going and kept adding a little bit more, until I (like so many others, I'm sure) couldn't wait to see the resolution of the story arc.  That's why this was somewhat of a let-down.  It almost seemed in this move that they just wanted to get the Ori over with so they could move on to some other story line.  The final resolution had a very artificial feel to it.  I realize that the show's  weakness (other than it's forays into comedy, which never quite worked) was a tendency to rely too much on a ""Deus Ex Machina"" type of resolution; and that's exactly what happened here.  The resolution didn't proceed from or rise out of the struggles of the SG-1; it was just kind of tacked on at the end.  Don't get me wrong: it was still well worth buying and watching; and I guarantee you, if I had never seen any other Stargate SG-1 story, I'd be shouting its praises from the rooftops.

3057379,4,B0010YSD7M,"The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- for one thing, the Ori were still threatening the world with conversion or death.

Fortunately that particular thread is decisively tied up in the direct-to-DVD movie that followed: ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" While it doesn't quite have the unique flavour of the TV series -- and the Ark seems like a rather pat quickie solution -- the movie does bring back all the favorite characters in a satisfactory ending.

""The Ark of Truth"" is an Ancient device that brainwashes people -- and SG-1 is searching for it, where they run into Vala's ex-hubby Tomin (who ends up teaming up with them). But soon they have a lead on where the Ark might be, and head for Celestis in the hopes of finding a bloodless method of stopping the Ori once and for all.

Unfortunately they have a slew of new problems -- Ori motherships are approaching Earth with the intent to convert or destroy, a nasty IOA rep has created and loosed a very familiar enemy on the Odyssey, and Vala's malevolent daughter Adria has gained godlike power. Fortunately SG-1 has a powerful ally of their own.

Since ""The Ark of Truth"" is basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as such they're not quite as satisfying as the television show was. Unfortunately it sometimes feels rather rushed and has a somewhat out-of-the-blue solution (hello magic fix-all!), as well as a subplot involving ANOTHER superpowerful villain race that seems likely but a bit misplaced.

But as half of the series finales, it's a solid piece of work -- lots of action, space battles, mysterious artifacts, and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. Fortunately that budget doesn't mean it jettisons the intriguing twists (Adria has an unexpected new position) or the moral dilemmas raised by the Ark (and the question of fighting evil faux gods vs. their followers).

It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, ""Star Trek"" homages, witty dialogue (""Well, you don't expect me to remember."" ""With the fate of two galaxies hanging in the balance, yes, I expect you to remember the essential clue!""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts.

And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder does a good strong, slightly quirky soldier. Christopher Judge gets to shine in  as a powerful, wise warrior, and Black gets to be both funny (""I have broken every nail"") and emotional.

While it's a bit rushed and contrived, ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" is a solid enough finale to the Ori storyline. Only half the ending to go.",1231718400,,2767,4.820675105485232

The acting was top of the line Stargate SG-1 fare but I wasn't impressed with the use of replicators as a catalyst in the story. The ""Terminator"" also made it more cheesy because the replicators could have just made multiple Terminators without the need for human tissue. Why stay in a crab-like form all the time? It is in my humblest opinion that Continuum was a much more polished story, primarily because The Ark of Truth was a quick finish to the Ori storyline.

Therefor, I was happy to see the final episode released as a movie. One of the ""menu"" choices even included a brief prelude summary leading up to the movie itself.
 The movie started out a little slow, but soon ramped up into high gear as befitting this final episode. The effects, acting, and story line were top notch. To my surprise,they even brought back an earlier enemy that added an additional exciting element to the story.
 My only complaint is that after purchasing this DVD, I learned that another SG-1 movie is available for purchase. So, which is the season finale?",1225670400,,756,4.71969696969697

I am a Stargate fan but this film was a disappointment.
I had expected the end battle between SG-1 versus the Ori instead the replicators were the main threat to SG-1. The previously powerful Ori ships looked very weak with 4 of them attacking and doing almost no damage.
A almost dead Teal'c after being shot in the back crosses a mountain range in super speed and finds the city of the Ori.
Then the final battle Adria who has all the power the Ori once had does not even get into the film until the end where she is tricked and we are supposed to believe most of her power just disappears for her fight against one ancient. Which is a copy of Threads.

There are plenty of things to like about the movie. Excellent visual effects, nice battle scenes with Ori followers, as well as a wink and a nod to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on occasion, make this a step above the average show episode. And yes, the Ori story arc is finally closed.

What's not to like? No big battle between the Ancients and the Ori, Carter suddenly becoming less efficient and a lot more girly, yet another over-the-top IOA guy, and last but not least the ""resurrection"" of a long defeated enemy. And oh yeah, no Jack O'Neill.

The main characters had virtually nothing to do in the movie.  Sam spent her time blowing stuff up.  Tilk, nothing but looking tough.

""The Ark of Truth"" is intense and dramatic.  While it is the length of a full feature film, I thought it was more like a very long (and cool) episode of Stargate SG-1.

3057444,5,B0010YSD7M,"As a long time Stargate SG-1 fan who has come and gone throughout the ten-year run of the series, and had been watching quite regularly for the last couple of years, I was sad to hear that the show was finally coming to an end. When you grow so close to characters that you feel they are as much a part of your life as the real people in your life, the thought of losing these characters can really instill an impending sense of loss within you. And in some ways, I was feeling this very thing as the show neared its end.

And then I began hearing about the Stargate movies. While excited to see the films when they came out, I was also apprehensive, because the fatal flaw inherent in the act of anticipation is that such things can rarely live up to one's high expectations. But as it turns out, Stargate - The Ark of Truth far exceeded my expectations.

The film picks up and completes the Ori saga which had dominated the series for its last two seasons, and takes us into the Ori galaxy in search of The Ark of Truth, the only device capable of stripping the Ori of their powers by revealing the ""truth"" to their devout followers. The movie is classic Stargate, except it feels bigger, more grand in scale and scope. Even though it wasn't shown on a big screen, you get a bit of the cinematic experience when watching SG-1 travel to the Ori galaxy and doing battle on several different fronts, as always walking on the brink of disaster. While each of the characters get their just moments in the spotlight, Cam Mitchell (played excellently as always by Ben Browder) steals the show with some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a Stargate show. The movie is a fitting ending to the series as a whole, and also puts a nice cap to the Ori saga.

The DVD extras are also nice. My favorites were the behind the scenes special which runs about half an hour, and the footage of the Q &A session filmed at ComicCon. Getting to see Ben Browser, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge as themselves was quite fun. And for those not familiar with the series or the Ori storyline, there is a prelude which will catch you up on the storyline and lead you right into ""The Ark of Truth.""

So if you are a fan of Stargate, or of good adventurous Science Fiction, give ""Stargate - The Ark of Truth,"" a try!

I hate to say that, because I loved watching the program when Richard Dean Anderson was starring. I have to say I only bought the 'Ark of Truth' because they left the Ori plot line dangling when the final season ended. To be honest, I felt cheated out of my money for this DVD. Granted, the producers had more money for creating a longer, more special effects laden product. Unfortunately they forgot the plot. I always had the impression that the Ori, this supposedly invincible foe, was going to end with a whimper. That is how it felt to me. Did we really need a plot line that had the Replicators involved one more time? How many times do you need to defeat them before they go away, permanently? I will have to think long and hard about shelling out for the second installment, Continuum. Three stars for what the series originally offered the fans.",1211328000,27,997,4.453551912568306

The 'ark' as a (completely) magic pill was beyond absurd and what leads to my two star rating.  Very good (but not cinematic) production values, acting, special effects, etc - but basically, this was a two-part TV show that should have been at least a half hour longer in order to provide some believable story line for the ark itself.  The cost for a two-TV-episode-equivalent DVD seems pretty high, given my disappointment in the plot.  But considering that DVD sales are their only revenue to pay for the production, I suppose I shouldn't complain.

See, the good thing about SG1 pre-Ori, was that all the characters had personality - even the bad old Goa'uld. When they introduced the Ori, all that ended. The Goa'uld you loved to hate. The Ori you could only hate.

Everything in this movie seemed rushed and disjointed. The ending was hokey. The movie was filled with scenes that were reminiscent of scenes from pre-Ori episodes.

I have to wonder why Christoper Judge was even in the movie. Did he speak two complete sentences in the entire movie, other than to try to make ""Tommy"" not feel so despairing over his past?

Vala's Ori daughter added almost nothing to the movie - her petulant pouting and posturing not withstanding.

We were glad to see, finally, an ancient actually take responsibility and bust the chops of the Ori.

The way the movie ended, they left it open for future SG1 movies. From what I've read of Continuum, though, there seems to be nothing original they can do to return to the glory days of SG1.

Suffice to say, this movie was a great wrap-up to end an amazing series. The only thing that would have been better was if the series was never cancelled and there could've have been an extra season or two of episodes to tidy things up.

The one drawback I found with the movie was how the movie seemed compressed in an effort to finish the Ori story in a clean manner. While the movie did a great job of tying up loose ends, it felt rushed compared to 10 seasons of episodes. It's just a shame that Richard Dean Anderson didn't at least make a cameo appearance (at least he'll be playing a big role in Stargate: Continuum<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Continuum/dp/B0017MO10U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate: Continuum</a>)

While I enjoyed the acting and energy the cast placed into the story, it was the story that I felt most dissapointed on. While I can understand that adressing all elements of the story arc with the Ori is next to impossible, I was most dissapointed with the final show down with Adria. Without giving away any spoilers for those who have not seen the film, I'll just say they solved the problem with her by using ""Magic Wizards""- A translation of this means that what was supposed to be a big, all out, triumph for the SG-1 and those who were plagued by Adria and her minions, ultimatly was not. I felt as if the writers wrote themselvs into a corner and when they could't get out of it, they brought in a supernatural force that was used minmally to toot the victory horn, hence, when you can't explain it well or don't know what to do, use Magic Wizards. They can end any story and get any hero out of a bind, magically. You know, it's sci- fi, anything can happen, right?

The acting was done well enough that I actually liked Carter in the movie, which is a rarity. In fact, I used this movie for a school project because of the writing and how it related to religions. The only thing I would say I wasn't happy about was I felt like there was a missing time period between the ending of the series and the beginning of the movie. Perhaps a brief 30 second ""this is what we've done"" explanation would be been nice.

3057507,3,B0010YSD7M,"For what it was this movie was good.  A few questions are answered and the Ori are dealt with permanently but, and its a big but, it just wasn't very satisfying.  I kept getting the feeling that this was just a slightly stretched out epsiode, maybe what should have been the final episode of the series instead of the one where they are stuck on the ship.  If it had been the end of the series I might have raved about it, as it is though it just didn't have the punch that I wanted.  There wasn't enough drama and the action seemed very forced.  The action mostly revolved around a completely out of left field plot point that just left me scratching my head.  Its like they tried to make up more action so that all of the characters could have screen time, it was completely unnecessary and other more interesting action could have been thought up.  I apologise for being purposefully obtuse but I don't want to give away anything for people who haven't seen the movie yet.

The Ori were never very interesting bad guys to me, the whole destroy the heretics thing just left me yawning, because of that the last two seasons of Stargate SG1 were not as fullfilling as they could have been for me personally.  This movie was a last chance for the Ori to be an interesting baddie, and in that the movie failed.  At least this isn't truely the end.  Continuum sounds much more interesting, but then again I always though Baal was a very good bad guy.  The Ark of Truth was a good wrap up to the Ori saga but lets get some down and dirty SG1 action to send off the series properly.",1209081600,,1577,4.308474576271187

I think by the time the last film is done they will have totally exhausted all possible plot lines for this series.  But anything that can outlast star trek can't be bad.

Taking place where the series ended and completing the 2 year fight with the Ori, The Ark of Truth is a grand conclusion to one of the best series ever made. It is a fast, thrilling feature length film that complements what has come before without making to too complex. Without giving away too many details, this finishes what season 9 -10 was building to and gives it a grand finale.  A wonderful bonus for new comers ... or those that have wandered away from the series in earlier seasons, it comes complete with a featurette, SG-1: The Road Taken, which catches anyone up for the orginal movie. I recommend everyone watch it before seeing Ark of Truth.  This movie is the best of SG-1, condensed into movie form, with loads of special effects the series couldn't afford.

It was really nice to revisit with the Stargate crew and it was also worth the wait for the completion of the Ori Story Arc. There are only two downsides for me to come out of this made for DVD movie. First, I have to wait for the next one. And second, I missed seeing Richard Dean Anderson in the movie. To me, he will always be the rock that Stargate SG-1 was built on. After saying that, it was well worth the money I spent of the DVD.",1208908800,,523,4.038461538461538

It was nice to wrap up the Ori story line, we were all left hanging abit with the last televised episode.

3057518,5,B0010YSD7M,"I started watching the original Stargate movie, and while I thought it was good (maybe 3.5 out of 5 stars) I really wasn't interested in seeing an entire series devoted to the concept.  I still remember recording a couple eposodes of Stargate SG1 off of the SciFI channel a few years after it first aired, and being absolutely mesmerized.

Since then, I've seen every eposode, some a few times.  Yes, I'm an addict.  Still, I didn't weep when the series ended.  I thought it had done a great job of exploring its reality.

But there were a lot of loose ends.  The Ark of Truth ties many of these off, and in doing so, creates much of the excitement that permeated the first season of the series.  Good writing, great cinematography, a tight plot, and a cast we all love.

OK, can we have another?",1208736000,,796,4.43448275862069

They did a great job releasing this and I don't feel bad for paying for an extended episode movie type thing on dvd. All of the characters are pretty much given their respect, especially one I hated, Toeman.

3057534,5,B0010YSD7M,"I loved it. (no spoilers in this review)

I could write for hours, but no one wants to read all that much. Let me just state that the sets were magnificent; the score was great; the explosions rocked; the private jokes that hearken back to snippits from the series made me laugh out loud; the plot was thick with layers of tension (because when does SG-1 get just one problem to overcome?)...

Even viewers who are intimately familiar with the Stargate SG-1 series lore will benefit from the quick-n-dirty ""review"" feature on the DVD. I recommend watching this, not just so you can see what a great job the editors did, but to give you the refresher before diving into the movie.

And when you dive in, hang onto your couch cushions. Make sure your glass is full and the pitcher of your favorite beverage is nearby because you're not going to want to even pause this thing to go get more. Once the movie started rolling, I couldn't tear myself away. The action starts and the storyline is already pulling you in. There's backstory to develop and it develops fast. There's no long, drawn-out explanation. No. It's ""dive in and then speed to present-day because we've got a movie with a ton of action to pack in."" And some fancy explosions. And some cool bad guys.

The special effects we've been spoiled with on the series were magnified. The dialogue and interaction among characters was dead on. I couldn't ask for more. Well...except maybe for more movies. When does the next one come out?

From Sandy Lender, ""Some days, I just want the dragon to win.""",1208563200,,1555,4.59927797833935
3057535,5,B0010YSD7M,"I looked forward to this DVD release ever since Stargate SG1 regular series ended.  It did not disappoint.

The only thing missing was Jack O'Neill, and then the movie would have been perfect.

That aside, the story pulls all the ORI threads together to a satisfying resolution.  The CGI effects are especially impressive.

I was a bit puzzled with the introduction of a second ""bad guy"" storyline, and would have liked to see more of the cool Asgard technology.

But, I've watched it two or three times now. You can tell the cast and crew have a wonderful time working together, and have built long-term relationships.

Because they have fun, we, the viewers, have as much (if not more) fun watching.",1208563200,,701,4.743801652892562
3057536,2,B0010YSD7M,"Don't set yourself up for disappointment.  Stargate SG-1's Ark of Truth is rather pedestrian.  The writer/director just didn't come up to par.

This doesn't mean that if you are a Stargate SG-1 fan that you shouldn't manfully suffer through it, if only to see Christopher Judge's Teal'c explain a personal Truth to Vala's Ori devotee husband.

When the first Star Trek movie came out, all of us fans went to see it. It was great fun seeing our favorite characters again -- Captain Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty -- even if the story plot was mostly derivative from earlier TV episodes and some was plain boring.  And then  there was the great new special effect of the Enterprise going into warp drive and the great new music.

But this movie doesn't even have the characters we came to love in the early Stargate SG-1 seasons.  Richard Dean Anderson's fabulous Colonel Jack O'Neill is replaced by a couple refugees from Farscape -- Ben Browder and Claudia Black, and Amanda Tapping's Captain (later Major) Carter is turned into a Kewpie doll.

Worst of all, Teal'c is called ""Muscles"" by Vala and not made to regret it.  Michael Shank's Daniel Jackson did reasonably okay; but it was an ego choice, not a good character realization choice to stop wearing the glasses.  I could have forgiven all this if only we'd had one cameo of General Jack O'Neill.

Forget special effects.  Also pedestrian.  Plus the director didn't seem to know how to make the transition from small to large screen.  Too often his choices for acting and camera angles and dramatic close ups are stilted TV screen fare, not smoothly inconspicuous as in a good movie.

BUT, without us supporting Star Trek: The Movie, there wouldn't have been Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was really great science fiction movie story writing and acting.  Nor would there have been Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which was such a lot of fun.

So, buy this anemic movie and pray that the next one redeems it, and that hopefully someone who understood the magic of the first 4 seasons (before the French bought the series and began ruining it) is brought in to do the writing and someone with some imagination and originality collaborates.

However, it's a very short movie, at only 80 minutes long, and it felt at times that the producers were trying to put too much in the movie without giving it all the proper storytelling that it deserved. This movie could've been improved with about 30 more minutes added onto it. There were times when I felt like I was watching what could actually have been individual episode plots had the show been renewed for an 11th season, but have now been mashed together to make one big episode/movie. Also, because it was now a movie, it seemed like the director felt that the ante had to be upped, making the villains even badder, the situations even more dire, and the characters even more whumped. However, despite it's somewhat rushed feeling, I enjoyed all of it. It was nice to see Vala's old husband, Tomin, and know what finally hapened to him, and it felt good to see the team together again. It goes without saying that most SG-1 fans will like it, so if you're an Stargate fan, it really is a must see, if for nothing else than closure.",1208217600,,1148,4.419811320754717

Each of the team members undergoes a personal trial without the physical help or support of the other members.  The drama and tension is successfully maintained until the end.

Naturally, another movie needs to be made....how about finishing off the Wraith in a crossover plot with the remaining SG Atlantis people!",1208131200,,478,4.9375

I find it the rough equivalent of a two-part episode that closed the story on the Ori's involvement in the Milky Way and Pegasus galaxies.  My only negative criticism is that the discovery and implementation of the Ark happened too quickly.  The story easily could have been extended over several DVDs of this length.  Having stated that, I understand the need to resolve the loose ends in one shot.  I hope there is more Stargate to come.",1208131200,,550,4.808510638297872

Everything at the SGC in this movie looked totally different presumably because they had a bigger budget (better lights, film camera, etc). I like the look, but if it's gonna veer so far from what people are used to it's gonna feel ""off"" somehow.

An appearance by RDA would have been great but only if it would have fit the Story Line. All the Characters in this Series I loved, some I was sorry to see go. Glad Michael Shanks returned, it wasn't quite the same without him.

Ark of Truth serves its purpose and ties up loose ends but with little originality or suspense and with a good deal of bland dialog. The interaction between characters lacks the humor and spark of the television series.

The Ark of Truth attempts to close the story in a satisfying way, but in my opinion, falls short. What has happened is, the entire planned 11th season was condensed into a 90-minute movie. And that's really what it feels like.

I will say that the movie benefits from a second viewing, and when viewed more as an episode of the series, it feels a little better. However, there were better action sequences in countless episodes than there are to be found in AoT. In places it just felt like it drug on a bit. In others, it felt rushed.

The budget is clearly higher per minute of on-screen time than the weekly series.  But budget was never a weakness of the series.  ""Stargate SG-1"" was consistently great with what it had.

Other than being unsatisfied by the breakneck pace, ""The Ark of Truth"" is a useful, if temporary, fix for everyone who lost a major source of entertainment pleasure with the ending of the Stargate SG-1 series.

Teal'c got more screen time than usual, which was a treat, and the movie hit a nice balance between wrapping up the loose ends of the series and keeping the team dynamic moving forward.  The music was just terrific and the effects great but not so big that they overshadowed the story.  My one nit-pick is that Sam didn't have as much of a role as I would have liked, but on the whole I think the balance was good - I love Vala and Cam and thought they were served well without neglecting the rest of the team.

There could have been some more historical scenes and some better explanations of things that needed to be wrapped up from the series.  However, overall I feel that the movie is a pretty good wrap up of the story.  It definitely had some great music (adding a symphony orchestra rather than synthesized music is almost always better in my book) and awesome visual effects (a bigger movie budget always helps not that the series had bad effects by any means).

The best part of the movie was that it ended but left the door open for other movies to follow. Just another day at SGC. I like that. Well done indeed. They will,however, have to work around Sam being head of Atlantis should other movies follow. But I nitpick. If you like SG-1, you will love this movie.",1207699200,,410,4.337662337662338

But, in my opinion, the writers did a very good job of taking the story from hour long episodic adventure and creating a 2 hour movie. Also, it appears that there is a second movie in the making... I look forward to keeping the collection growing.

This is a good showing from a movie that was better with the director's cut filling out the missing pieces. Then transferring to the small screen, and taking us on a journey worth the ride.",1207612800,,522,4.326530612244898

I would have loved to see how Vala got the keys to open the cells but that all was cut out.  The cuts were obvious through out the film.  I would have rather seen the film for 120 to 150 minutes then see it so leap froggy.  Don't do it again to the next film!!!

P.S. I loved the cinematography, the actors, the humor, the plot and Stargate,SG-1!  I just couldn't stay focused when I had questions about how, when, or where.  I'm glad I have the DVD to see it more than once and quess what was in the cuts.  Can I have the uncut version, please?",1207612800,,690,3.9420289855072466

Could have been an episode if they had taken out some of the pointless middle 'plotlines'. Made me miss Jack and I still don't like Carter's new hair. The best part was the behind the scene part where they show how they have a gel coating they can put on a stuntman and then light them on fire with a blow torch and not hurt them-at all.

But Vala and Cam do a good job of replacing Jack. It was also good to see that the directors let Vala look beatiful as well as Sam.  The pigtails did not show up which I thought was good.  The plot did not lag at all. There was plenty of action. This was a great movie and cannot wait for the next one.,1207526400,,467,3.925531914893617

I think the movie was good but I was expecting a lot more.  The epic battles were epic to the point and tune of 30 seconds. I would say get this DVD if your a fan of SG1 and want to see how their story ends.  If you don't like the series then this movie isn't for you.,1207526400,,399,3.6588235294117646

3057674,4,B0010YSD7M,"When Stargate SG1 first appeared on the Showtime Pay network I was there with a bit of dread.  I know of many occations where a succcessful movie was bled for episodic television fare.  I was delighted in the differance from the Big Screen production and found it's quality writing and winning cast very addictive and enjoyable.  When after Ten years it was taken off Broadcast televison and going to Direct to DVD I was crossing my fingers that this trend would move forward to the new format.  After the first Made for DVD I must say it is a mixed bag.
  The story attemped to take alot of the concepts the producers were planning for the 11th season and it seems like they tried to jam them into a single feature length setting.  I think knowing the cast and the character development from the past ten years made a big diffeance for me to help  fill in the blanks that they had to race over to make it fit.  I am not sure if it will work the same magic for the newcommer.
  It had alot of things mixed together in a small box such as the Ori and the Replicators and the Giant Space Gate.  In the end the most evil cuts come from our earthbound evil element in the form of a misguied and compromized EOC agent who makes more of a mess then the Stargate team can handle...Well almost.
  The sound quality and picure is first rate and the special effects are a point above average from the televison series and the extras are reasonalbe and informative for both new viewers and the more experiance viewer.

I've been a fan of the series since the first season and mourned when Richard Dean Anderson left the show, but was intrigued (if a little confused) by the Ori arc.  I have to admit that I didn't see every episode the last few seasons, and the last dvd set I bought was season 8, but I was completely and utterly entertained by the movie.  High production value, great script, good combo of action/dialog/science and tech that has always been a trademark of SG-1.  I highly recommend it.",1207440000,,557,4.642857142857143

Replacing Richard Dean Anderson, those are really hard shoes to follow and I think Ben Browder does a really good job. I love his humor and one liners in this movie, he pulled off the ""hero"" role well! Without ruining it for anyone, I can not go in to detail, but he isn't ""perfectly fine"" in the end, it goes with the story. (That should make you curious).

I think wrapping up the Ori, I am glad they were able to finsh the storyline, bringing back Aydria, Tomin and Morgan were great! The twist on the ship, interesting and definatly, ""Oh My Gosh"". Vilian with the IOA, I hated him, but that was the point!

Loved seeing a point of view from Tealc' that had not been seen before, that I remember anyway. His scene with Tomin was very powerful.

One liners were great, cast did an amazing job, as always! Can not give anything away, but there are still one or two loose ends character wise, I would like to see wrap up for the series.

I loved the movie since it brought to an end the season 10 story. Great special effects and story line. Too bad we didn't get to see Colonel Jack O'Neil again. It also opens the possibility to take the team in new adventures either to Atlantis or on its own.

I just wish SciFi or another network would have continued the series.",1207353600,,364,4.432835820895522

I understand there's one more on the way, and if there's anything to complain about is it left me wanting more.  Why did Sci-fi have to cancel the series?

  Love the SG-1 series (seasons 1-8). Not sure which writers were fired for 9&10 but they were certainly the best writers. Having suffered through two seasons of the Ori (a race Clearly capable of destroying Earth at any time, either directly or via proxies - yet unable to do so ...... because that would end the series), I was further disappointed with the movie.
  In 'The Arc of Truth' they now produce a mantage of all of the very worst plot devices used by the series.
  a) If you thought the Ascended Ancients were double-talking pacifists before, just wait until you see why they allowed uncounted billions to suffer under the Ori when their motivations are finally explained.
  b) If you didn't already have a gut-full of Shadow agencies launching suicidally ill concieved back-stabbing maneuvers. You'll love what the IOA pulls. (Makes the viewer take solice in the imminent destruction of Earth, if only because the IOA will finally be gone as well.)
  c) An old enemy (killed off twice now) comes back ...... again.

  d) Deus et Machina. Only the Arc can save us. That and noting else.... sound familiar?........ for the third time now?
  #1 Hunt for the lost city of the Ancients (was an origional plot at the time, and a good one.... then).
  #2 Hunt for Merlin's wonder thingy that destroys Ascended Beings (Two whole seasons of futile defensive measures turned around in one shot). Masochists rejoice!
  #3 The Arc of Truth. Find it or lose again (no matter what else you might do).

  They may wish to title the next movie ""SG-1: The Latest Scavenger Hunt""

  Or..... they can hire writers that do justice to the fine actors and special effects work. (Some basic math skills would be good too. ZPMs seem to be capable of destroying Star Systems in one episode and deplete themselves heating bath water the next in the Atlantis spin-off.)

  The actors, special effects and legacy of seasons 1-8 deserve better writing than this...... much better.",1207094400,10,2115,4.78393351800554

There seemed like there was enough complications to handle to fill 2 DVD's. This has been my favorite Science Fiction show (take that Battlstar Galactica)! However, I must admit that the show lost it's way when RDA retired. I kept hoping that he would show up in the movie, for a last bow. Ben Browder & Claudia Black gave it a valient try, but the Chemistry between Cantanerous Jack O'Neil-Samantha Carter- Daniel Jackson & Teal'c could not be matched. This is the Only TV show that I am familier with that was better than the Original feature length film (which , I did enjoy). Enjoy the DVD.

Then the show got cancelled so they held off production and those watching the series never had a wrap-up. What does this mean for the viewer.

All the acting was terrific as usual, and the special affects were great, and the subtle humor moments were classic Stargate, but the plot was just gone.

3057725,3,B0010YSD7M,"SPOILERS AHEAD....

Stargate has always had its homages to other genre shows and they are clearly on display here -- the opening caption paraphrasing ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"", the peak-to-peak aeral shot just beging for Gondor outposts to light the signal fires, a Terminator-like rise from an explosion, ... (I'm sure folks can spot more).

The visual effects were lovely, and there were some really good bits of characterization. The converation between Teal'c and Tomin was wonderful, as was Tomin's final scene with Vala.

As for the rest...
While many a Stargate villain comes direct from Central Casting, Marrick (the IOA guy) is particularly ill-written in a series that brought us Senator Kinsey, Colonel Maybourne, and even the briefly-referenced Mr. Woolsey. In prior episodes where the IOA, NID, or Senator Kinsey were challenging the SGC often they had a legitimate PoV, even if they were wrong. Here, they are just wrong and profoundly stupid.

Similarly, Adria mostly gets to chew scenery in her scenes with Vala rather than have some character development before her inevitable defeat. (Itself a solution borrowed from Oma Desala's final battle with Anubis.)

Others have commented on problems with the Replicator subplot and Repli-terminator -- one other aside -- what did they make the walls and BLUs (blinkie-light-units, per the commentaries) out of?! Thousands of high-power rounds blasted around them, and not one bit of damage? Yet they bend when Mitchell is tossed into them? Yes, limits of CGIs, but might have been nice to show some collateral damage on a movie-scale budget.

The wounded Teal'c walking montage eventually blew my suspension of disbelief -- particularly when it is apparently occuring at the same time as Carter and Mitchell's battle with the Replicators (who knew Teal'c could walk that fast!).",1206835200,20,1856,5.17

It takes all the action and drama and heroism that made the show great, and takes it to a grander scale.  The orchestral score, the sweeping panoramas, and the harrowing fight to the finish make it a fitting conclusion to the show's biggest story arc.  The only thing marring it is the resurrection of a thrice-eradicated nemesis, but it lives up to the challenge of concluding the greatest sci-fi show since Star Trek.",1206748800,,610,4.278260869565218

I am sorry the series ended but glad they did the movie to tie up some loose ends.  Vala is wonderful as the new ""Smart-A"" replacing Jack's personality.

Actually, the best part of the whole DVD is to watch one of the features called Stargate at Comic-Con.  An interview in front of the public with Teal'c, Samantha and the producers.  Teal'c is hysterically funny, especially when he does his Randy Jackson impersonation from American Idol.  Samantha joins right in as Paula, and of course, a Simon comment.  After seeing Teal'c stiff as a board for so many years, I nearly died laughing.  He should be a comedian.  Teal'c calls Daniel on his cell phone.... hold on to your cheeks!

3057730,3,B0010YSD7M,"As a die hard SG1 fan,  I knew I was going to buy this movie  I know I am also going to buy Continium.

With that said, I think the movie was good,  but definitely not the best.  I think my main complaint is I miss Richard Dean Anderson.  I missed that wise cracking swash buckling role.  His just tell me where to shoot ""Carter"" personality helped balance the acadamic DR Jackson and Col Carter and his ""MacGyver ( for lack of better term )"" persona helped balance that muscle man named Telk.

I love Ben Bowder in Farscape,  but his character in SG1 is too much like a comic book super hero.

With that said,  I thought the story was good.  I felt the time the replicator story line took could have been better spent with the Odyssey battling the ORI fleet (arguably though we have seen enough of Odyssey/Daedalus space battles in SG1 and Atlantis).  The entire replicator story line was the movies main weakness.

I love Claudia Black.  Her character in SG1 is perfect for the show and makes up a ""little"" bit of what was missing from the Jack O'Neil character.

I was disappointed in not seeing much of Amanda Tapping.  Is her goal now to move behind the camera,  because you don't see her much in Atlantis also.

Overall this movie does a nice job wrapping up the ORI arc,  but despite its bigger budget and longer runs,  I felt that creators of SG1 did better jobs in previous episodes (Lost City 1 and 2, New Order 1 and 2 etc) with a lot less.

Everyone (all of SG-1 heroes) have their parts perfectly played out in the usual style. My only disappointment is that Adria (played by Morena Baccarin) the main villain has very little screen time. I think out of the whole 102 minutes of the movie she has probably around less than 5 minutes of screen time. The plot is somewhat simplistic but it worked as the movie is on a time constraint and puts an inevitable closure to the chapters in the Ori storyline arc. Can't wait for Stargate: Continuum as it will be interesting how SG-1 will outwit and survive Ba'al's trickeries.

They tried to jazz up the replicators with animated skeletons but I wasn't fooled.  Those replicators looked *tired*....  :-(

Although not entirely original in its concept it is orignal in its twists. In ""Reckoning"" the Replicators all but destroy the Goauld System Lords and the humans destroy the Replicators, the IOA build on the idea that if the Replicators can destroy the Ori, just as they did the Goauld, then Earth can contain or destroy the replicators. Just as always, the IOA is wrong, the Replicators can not be controlled or contained for very long. Add this to ""Threads"", the concept that one Ancient can step in and battle another ascended being to stop them. Oma Desala battles Anubis, stopping him from reforming his armies - Nearly the same happens in this film, ending the Ori threat. I don't want to give away too much, but this movie is worth watching and adding to your collection, because in life, as in art, history DOES repeat itself, and in the Stargate Universe its always fun to watch it repeat.",1206403200,2,1006,4.594444444444444

Bring them on....",1206403200,,396,4.513888888888889
3057741,3,B0010YSD7M,"Mostly because of the unceremonious ending and my decade old love affair with the show, I had high expectations for the film that would come to be called ""The Ark of Truth."" Maybe they were too high. It could also be that after 10+ years of watching 60-90 minute episodes that I became too familiar with the format and a full length film didn't fit the mold I'd created in my head.

Regardless, I was ultimately disappointed. I felt that even though the film was made for fans like me, it jumped into the story too quickly. It made the literary mistake of telling and instead of showing. The quick transitions in the storyline assumed that the watcher had the knowledge to fill in the blank and while we may have, it still made for a jumpy film that had a lot of holes in it.

I had hoped that given the time they had we would see the writers produce a very good script, but overall the writing was not a sharp as some of the better episodes of the show. It wasn't nearly as snappy and quick witted and lacked some of the subtle poignant statements made throughout the series. I was especially disappointed that the few Bondesque one liners we got from Mitchell were mostly mediocre. Also, as a longtime fan I'd hoped to see more inside references (see Episode 200) that the die-hard fans could truly appreciate, but that wouldn't lose the casual fan.

The reemergence of the replicators, I feel, prevented the conclusion of the Ori storyline from being as deep and smooth as it could have been. It smacked of the writers running out of material to put it, but I feel that had they taken more time to tell the story thoroughly, this would not have been a problem.

Ultimately, I was glad to have the chance to buy the DVD and show my support for the franchise and it was nice to have the series finally wrapped up, but I think they could have done a much better job. I gave it three stars above, but 2.5 would be more accurate.",1206403200,,1927,4.35933147632312

3057744,3,B0010YSD7M,"First off, I have watched Stargate since the show started in 90's and I was a big fan of the original movie, so I was really excited to see a Stargate Movie! After watching it though, the movie actually seemed rushed, what I would have liked to have seen was this movie as the series finale on TV.

The whole Ori thing was beaten to death in the last two years of the show and the introduction of Vala(whatever her name is)over the last two seasons was a major disappointment for me, her character is boring and and out of place. Oh, and the replicators.. That is just old and tiresome, I actually lost interest in the movie when they introduced the replicators. And that whole fight scene at the end, that seemed to long and drawn out as well.

Having watched the show I was disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't make an appearance in the movie, his character was so well done through the years he was on the show that he really needed to be in this one as he is really a critical part of SG1 and what made those shows so good.

3057746,5,B0010YSD7M,"Stargate SG-1 got cancelled before all of the story arcs could be concluded, and one of these was the threat of the Ori.  The Ori were (was?) a group of ascended beings who were trying to obtain dominion over everyone who wasn't ascended, and promoted this through a quasi-religion.  ""Priors"" would appear on unconverted worlds and advise everyone that they could accept ""Origin"" as  the basis for their lives, or face destruction.  They were really good at the destruction part, due to some nifty technology and a seemingly limitless supply of warships.

""The Ark of Truth"" concludes this story line.  Without creating spoilers, it's basically an extended SG-1 episode with some great location shots and a hair better visual effects than usual.  It also sets the stage for additional adventures, should the market support more Stargate SG-1 specials like this.

Extras on the DVD include some behind-the-scenes featurettes and a clip from a fan convention where the producers and several cast members answer questions in a panel format.  Make sure you catch this, if only to see a hypernerd brand himself for all eternity by insisting that he be allowed to sing an ""Ode to Stargate"" composition he wrote, right in front of The Ancients and everybody.

SPOILER ALERT: It seems that the weapon sent to the Ori galaxy at the end of seson 10 worked, the Ori are all dead already but they've channeled all their power into Adriel. The Ark, that is supposed to have been missing for upteen thousands of years is rediculously easy to find and decipher. Let's not forget a gratuitous replicator subplot that seems to have been put in just to take up time.

They do conclude the Ori plot. They do it in a typical SG1 style. A lot of people are griping about the Ark (the object itself) but finding ancient artifacts that do cool things (lets call it military archaeology) is what SG1 has been about from the beginning.

The trips through the Gate were funded with finding this kind of stuff as its primary directive (""find technologies to defend Earth"") and of course isn't this sort of thing exactly what the Gate itself is???

The movie deals in the series' motifs (I would have been disappointed if it had not and tried too hard to be something else): ancient artifacts, space travel, free will, good vs. evil, politics...

3057753,5,B0010YSD7M,"5 Stars, great job. BUY IT!

At first I was a little wary. I usually don't like straight-to-DVD movies. However, I was really surprised after a few minutes into it. I love the show, and continue to watch reruns whenever I get a chance.

This is basically one long episode of SG1 that they didn't get a chance to air. Think of it as Stargate SG-1 Season 11: The Movie. The actors didn't drop a beat when making this film. Great continuity.

Ark of Truth is what Peacekeeper Wars did for Farscape, only we didn't have to wait 4 years. Because of this fact, none of the actors aged greatly passed their characters (*cough*Chiana*cough*).

As far as plot goes, they couldn't have done it better. Even though many people would agree that after Richard Dean Anderson left the show, it was no longer SG1, Ben Browder and Claudia Black performed better than anyone joining a show after 10 very successful seasons. I can't consider them replacements. Their characters influenced the plot drastically, which makes them unique to the flow of the series. To me, they should have been in the show since day one, but they were busy in another galaxy in an alien ship doing Farscape.

Special effects were wonderful, but not throughout the whole film. In the beginning, especially, the sets looked like sets rather than other planets. That's okay though, because it wasn't distracting.

All in all, it was a masterfully produced film and conclusion the the Ori arc. Well done. Go buy this dvd!",1206057600,2,1478,4.709302325581396

But somehow this became more about the replicators than the Ori/priors. Honestly I expected an all out battle between the priors & SG-1 and between the Ori & the ancients. But instead it was a battle with the replicators. I thought it was lame & it took from the main bad guys which were the Ori. There was so much story & discoveries they could have shown, but the writers took they easy way out. I think it could have been cool to use all of earth's ship in a battle against the ori ships. That would have been cool. But no Lets go back to a story that we have over done ""the replicators"". Honestly I am a huge fan of this show because of the story that they told in the TV series, but now I feel that the writers owe us a great ori story.

One of the most important aspects of the original series was that it took you to new and exciting places along with intellectually stimulating concepts.  What happened to the original SG 1 members?  What happend to the competent Carter and Teal'c?  I had to endure the entire movie watching them totally out of character with their former roles, while an inordinate amount of time is spent on developing the two newcomers, claudia black and ben browder, neither of which are at the same acting level of the original SG 1 team.

The plot did have a few potholes, but the thing that bugged me most was that ""Cam"" was given dialog with 2 obscenities, something that was never used while the show was on Showtime (and the early days there even featured some female nudity, I might add).

I find obscenities demean the characters AND the persons watching, so without this, I might have given the show a 5 star rating.

BTW, the prolog included gives you a LOT of history up to the point of the movie, so if you're watching season 10 via syndication (like I am), it will have a few spoilers in it.  -The prolog is nearly 9 mins. long, and starts from the moment Cam's introduced to the show.

3057761,3,B0010YSD7M,"I've been a Stargate Fan since the first movie, and loyally throughout all 10 seasons over both cable networks it was carried on.  Stargate: Ark of Truth is a fun ride, a step up from the weekly show, but a disappointment in complete lack of story originality.

In this story, (AN EXACT CLONE OF THE REPLICATOR DEFEAT EPISODE IN SEASON 9) SG-1 discovers yet another ancient artifact that will destroy the nearly un-beatable near-omnipotent foe.  Exactly as they defeated the replicators with Bal's help in season nine, with a convenient 'link' between all Stargates and this Ancient weapon, the Replicators were wiped out in a single stroke, all over the galaxy with a coded entry on an old stone control pad.

Guess what happens at the end of this movie?  Well, without revealing everything, a convenient 'link' to all the ((blanks)) from an old stone/metal tablet Ark, wipes out all ORI believer's faith in one stroke once the critical coded pattern is stuck on the device.  ORI defeated, as quickly and as unbelievably neatly as the replicators were way back when.

Even more lackluster, the ORI ""were killed"" and not just wounded by the device sent to kill them in the latter part of Season 10 where Daniel Jackson was a Prior deceiving old evil Audra.  So, no better complexity of the Ancients versus the ORI, and how humanity can step in and fight is ever really explored.  We'll just leave Jackson a new ancient buried wonder-device to take care of it in the end.  With all of these perfect weapons laying around the universe in piles of desert dust, how in the world did the Wraith ever cause the ancients a sweat?  The ancients could not have found all of this stuff when they needed it?  Puhleeze!

Audra does little more than dance around in fiery steps, brag on about having all of the power, and wastes what could have been a nice scary scene with Claudia Black.  Julian Sands has a cup of coffee as the head prior, and then does nothing.  I was hoping for a bit more battle with the heavyweights!

The movie is fun, tosses in the predictable IOA manic official with poor judgment and an even poorer dialogue, but a terminator replicator he becomes, and of course Ben Browder will survive about 15 steel pounding hits without dying or being rendered inert.  The logic behind the IOA  guy's story for intentionally risking everyone's lives is silly, not even political paranoids could or would get away with his access and security passes.

We get some more astounding Canadian scenery, which is okay, the special effects are good, and the humor and dramatic elements are nicely brief and poignant for a change, so the movie moves well if the story lacks for any originality.  Oh my, IRONY, with ORI and ORIGIN, you get NO ORIGINALITY.  That point sticks with me badly I'm afraid.

The cast is sharp, but sadly, there is no pickup of Jackson's and Vala's destined romance, only Beau Bridges gets to deliver what is expected, and Tealc' is in good form.

I was shocked that I really did enjoy the show, about 2 hours 10 minutes of no boredom, but later as I rummaged the tale through my head, remembering it was little fun, so much potential missed, and a story completely cloned in the conflicting elements exactly to the old formula of beating the replicators, a similar track was used in older SG-1 episodes too.  Let's hope Stargate Atlantis does not suffer from such story redundancy and writer's laziness.  This copy-cat story transfer was a true shame, hope this writer did NOT GET PAID!  Adding in Replicators is a transparent attempt to boost cheap excitment levels and raise kids hands cheering, but leaves any mature Sci-Fi senses flat on the deck of the Odyssey swimming in that replicator shrapnel.

Most of us could have written a far better screenplay.  This was not bad at all, it is fun SG-1 show, worth the time, but the end-all story to a huge build-up from the past 3 seasons, had no merit, honor or punch in the end.  Its a feel-good send-off to all SG-1 fans, but only if you're VERY generous on forgetting that they've done this to you time and time again.

The actors and the show deserved a better ending to the ORI storyline!

I found the cinematography to be excellent, with a large number of panoramic special effect sequences that were a nice upgrade from the already-terrific standard set by the show. Joel Goldsmith's score for the film was absolutely fantastic, too. I'm hoping it will be released on CD soon.

3057765,4,B0010YSD7M,"I'm going to open with a politically charged statement but bear with me since I'm trying to make a sense.  BABYLON 5 and STARGATE SG-1 both have some pretty fanatical fans.  As a television series, I think BABYLON 5 was much the better of the two.  It took greater risks in its storytelling and did more to develop the possibilities of television SF.  On nearly every level, B5 was the more substantial show.  Nonetheless, most of the B5 movies simply were not very good.  STARGATE SG1: THE ARK OF TRUTH is, on the other hand, very good indeed.

Of course, one reason the movie is so good was because a number of important plot threads were left unresolved.  Gestures had been made toward the resolution of the Ori story, but it certainly hadn't been completed.  And I loved the fact that the series finale was devoted not to plot resolution but to spending time with the main cast members.  It was a very satisfying, relatively unambitious series finale.  But since the main appeal of the show had always been the main group of characters, it was completely appropriate.  ARK OF TRUTH managed to very satisfyingly wrap up the Ori story.

I suppose any individual might find reason to complain about one or other aspect of the film.  I always enjoy more rather than less Daniel Jackson, but here he didn't get as much of a hand in the story as usual.  I also really love a lot of Vala, especially when wearing nice midriffs, but as Claudia Black was pregnant during the filming of the film that wouldn't work.  I'm not sure precisely how pregnant she was, but let's just say she got to wear a lot of body armor in this one.

We not only got a resolution to the Ori arc, but we got to revisit our friends the Replicators.  Always got to love the Replicators.

This movie historically could prove to be of considerable importance, for good or ill.  Studios have been struggling with the whole idea of direct to DVD movies.  They are aware that there are several shows that have a cadre of extremely dedicated fans.  The question so far has been how to take advantage for the studio of this core group of fans in a way that satisfies the fans and makes business sense for the studios.  The main show in this regard has been FIREFLY.  Although cancelled after only 11 episodes were broadcast (though others were made), the series became one of the steadiest selling series in the history of television.  But here is where the story gets complex.  Turning FIREFLY into the movie SERENITY proved a box office disaster, with the movie failing to make back its costs.  But then once again the story gets complex.  SERENITY became a significant profit maker due to its DVD sales, to the point where a new and expanded DVD was released, which continues to sell well.  Now Universal is contemplating a second SERENITY movie.  But here is the dilemma.  Do they make another regular theater release film?  Or do they just go direct to DVD?

This is why STARGATE -- THE ARK OF TRUTH is so important.  If its sales are good and make a profit for the studio (also, there is a second STARGATE coming out this summer), then it could encourage other studios to take a risk with direct to DVD movies.  If both the STARGATE movies make money, then we might not only see SERENITY 2 (different studio, but this is something the industry is watching) but other beloved shows continue through direct to DVD productions.

So keep your fingers crossed!  Better yet, go buy a copy of the movie.  If this movie does well, we all stand to benefit not merely by additional STARGATE films, but other films and shows as well.",1205712000,4,3592,4.537383177570093

Production had already passed the midway point of its 10th season, making it the most enduring science-fiction TV series in U.S. history after Chris Carter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000UZDO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>, which lasted nine seasons from 1993-2002 on Fox TV.  (I was just as equally a fan of that one, too, and I look forward to the upcoming second feature film.)  That was the day that Sci Fi pulled the plug on our venerable ""SG-1"" as of the conclusion of season 10 in the spring of 2007.  ""SG-1"" ran from 1997-2007:  five seasons on pay-cable network Showtime and five seasons on the basic-cable network Sci Fi Channel.  Ten seasons on television is a venerable legacy no matter the genre, but to survive that long in science fiction is downright remarkable.

Despite the cancellation, however, there was a ray of sunshine.  MGM (the production company) was eager to continue their very profitable franchise, as was executive producer Robert C. Cooper.  (Spinoff series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis/dp/B000XEB160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis</a>&nbsp;recently completed season 4 on Sci Fi Channel [as of this review date] and will return with the first half [10 of 20 episodes] of season 5 in July 2008).

Thus came the announcement that ""SG-1"" would continue with at least two DVD movies, the first of which is this film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-The-Ark-of-Truth/dp/B0010YSD7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate:  The Ark of Truth</a>.  Filming occurred in their usual Vancouver, BC, soundstages as well as on location in the frigid Arctic in the early spring of 2007, and was immediately followed by the filming of STARGATE:  CONTINUUM, which will be released on DVD in July 2008.  The second DVD film will reportedly involve time travel and will feature the return of original ""SG-1"" series star Richard Dean Anderson as Col. Jack O'Neill.  MGM and Cooper are hopeful that continued interest in ""SG-1"" will fuel the fire for more DVD films with the ""SG-1"" casts (present and/or past).

For those unfamiliar with the ""Stargate"" universe, the Stargate teams are a super-secret branch of the U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with participants from other nations, operating beneath the NORAD complex located at the Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado.  The real entrance to the complex is used for exterior shots.  The public at large, of course, has been prevented from learning that humans from Earth have contacted aliens from other planets.  The Stargate itself is a circular portal through which humans are able to walk through and almost instantaneously, via a form of wormhole, be transported to planets in other star systems.  The Stargate is powered by alien technology, and the discovery of the Stargate and contact with aliens explained why earlier human civilizations believed in many of the gods with whom we are familiar in popular mythology today.

If you've never seen ""SG-1,"" you might be a bit confused by the complex mythology of ""Stargate,"" which really began with the 1994 feature film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate/dp/B0000844I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate</a>, starring Kurt Russell as Col. Jack O'Neill (later played by the aforementioned Anderson, who left the show as a regular after the eighth season to be closer to his family in L.A.) and a pre-""Boston Legal"" James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson (played throughout the series [with the exception of one season due to salary and the omnipresent ""creative"" issues] and also in this film by Vancouver native Michael Shanks).  Plotwise, the TV series' 1997 debut picked up one year after the feature film ended.

Suffice it to say, if you don't know the show, that it would be a good idea to think back to 1986's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-IV-The-Voyage-Home/dp/B000089QC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a>.  It was arguably the most popular of the 10 feature films (which will become 11 films in December 2008 with J.J. Abrams' prequel to the original 1966-69 TV series, where we find the young Kirk/Spock/McCoy triumvirate at Star Fleet Academy) because it was a basic, stand-alone story about saving two humpback whales whose survival literally also meant Earth's survival.  One needn't be a ""Star Trek"" fan to enjoy the so-called ""whale movie.""

In this film, the basic plot involves a threat to Earth by the evil race known as the Ori (""OR-eye""), who march across the galaxy and force entire planetary populations to submit to the Ori's bible, known as the Book of Origin (from which their name ""Ori"" is derived).  The Ori have the power to overcome virtually all that oppose them, and their retribution is swift and deadly.  The Ori are able to maintain their reigns of terror with the help of local representatives known as priors, to whom they are supremely dedicated and whom the Ori are able to totally control; or, resistance results in brutal retribution, with death and destruction in the Ori's wake.  Naturally, it's up to the SG-1 team to find the Ark of Truth, which holds the only known answer to eradicating the Ori before they reach Earth and fulfill their ultimate victory.  In a nutshell, it's your classic good vs. evil story, and it's a good one.

It's also the proper conclusion to the Ori storyline, which basically consumed the bulk of the ninth and tenth seasons' storylines.  Because the cancellation notice came while the writers and producers were more than half-way into the final season, the series finale left fans (like me) feeling ultimately unsatisfied.  This DVD film basically wraps up that storyline.

I promise that if you haven't seen the series, picking up the DVD will not make you feel like you've walked into a movie theater halfway into the film.  Like the ""Star Trek"" whale movie, it's a stand-alone DVD that you can easily follow.  You are just as easily able to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  Also, there's a wise addition of a ""catch-up"" sequence that provides clips from the series that refreshes viewers' minds of how we got to where we are, since the last new ""SG-1"" episode aired almost exactly one year prior to the release date of this DVD.

All of the cast members from seasons 9 and 10 are here:  Ben Browder (who is currently 45 as of the date of this review; Ben was raised in Charlotte, NC) as Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell (effectively Anderson's replacement); Amanda Tapping (42, from Toronto) as Lt. Col. Samantha Carter; Christopher Judge (43, from Los Angeles) as Teal'c; the aforementioned Shanks (37, from Vancouver) as Jackson; the seasoned veteran and always enjoyable Beau Bridges as Maj. Gen. Hank Landry (66, from Los Angeles, who replaced Don S. Davis, whose character, Maj. Gen. George Hammond, was ""promoted"" and shipped off to Washington, DC, at the end of season 7); and Claudia Black (35, from Sydney, Australia) as Vala Mal Doran.

The core cast is superb as usual.  Black can always be relied upon for comic relief, especially when Vala is frustratingly torturing the patience of Shanks' Jackson.  Those of us who were addicts of the late and supremely, fantastically great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape/dp/B0002VGSBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape</a>&nbsp;(1999-2003) still can't help but remember the chemistry that existed between Browder and Black, not Shanks and Black.  To placate some of the fans' very vocal ire at its cancellation, Sci Fi commissioned a two-night, four-hour miniseries in 2004,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Peacekeeper-Wars/dp/B0006FO9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars</a>, as a wrap-up.  The cost of producing the series in Australia, coupled with a drop in ratings in the fourth season, were the reasons given for the show's cancellation, but for its very dedicated fans, Sci Fi's excuses still ring as hollow today as they did then.

The cast and writers tip their caps to a couple of other sci-fi franchises, as you might recognize one character as ""Ah-nold"" in a certain, um, poor state of existence; and then Lt. Col. Mitchell takes the helm of the Odyssey to fight the Ori and mangles the order to get underway to the point that would probably make Capt. Jean-Luc Picard absolutely blanch, pull his shirt down stiffly, turn and walk into his ready room, and bark ""Earl Grey - Hot!"" at the replicator.  Seriously, they're both nice touches and honor other sci-fi classics that have gone before.

Prolific character actor Currie Graham (""NYPD Blue,"" ""Suddenly Susan""), who hails from Hamilton, Ontario, does his usual fine job playing the nasty guy with an ulterior motive.  This time his James Marrick is an agent from the secretive black-ops organization IOA.  He arrives under the premise of interrogating the captured ""enemy combatant"" Tomin (Tim Guinee).  The real purpose for his presence soon presents itself, however, and he puts everyone in peril.

Reprising her role of Adria is the simply stunning Morena Baccarin, who fans of Joss Whedon's work will remember as ""companion"" Inara Serra in the woefully underappreciated 2002-03 Fox TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>&nbsp;and its excellent 2005 followup feature film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B000Q9IZ5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>.  Adria, the daughter of Vala, has been genetically altered by the Ori to grow from a normal baby into an adult incredibly rapidly in order to serve as their epitome (and far beyond that) of the term ""demon child.""  The special effects used with Baccarin are quite impressive.

And also reprising his role as the commanding and all-fearing Ori leader Doci is one of my very favorite actors, Britain's Julian Sands, who is barely recognizable under his ghostly and unnerving makeup.  With his cape, collar, and staff, he makes for an imposing and fearsome foe.

The film, at 1:42, came across to me as what would have been a two-episode season-ending cliffhanger and season-premiere resolution, had they aired on Sci Fi.  In one of the bonus features, Cooper mentions that this film pretty much was written as such, since he didn't have the time to wrap up the plotlines because of the fairly late cancellation notice.  It wrapped up the Ori storyline, but that's pretty much all.  To that end, I wasn't exactly blown away.  Still, there was much to admire.

Having admittedly acrophobic Chris Judge (as you'll learn in a bonus feature) dropped onto a knife-edge snow-capped mountain peak in the Arctic and have him, as Teal'c after being injured by an Ori weapon, trek along toward a destination he is determined to reach, is gut-wrenching, nerve-racking, beautifully executed, and exquisitely shot.  (That's one difference between the budget of an hourly TV episode and a [perhaps modest] feature-length DVD film.)  The Arctic landscapes are, to quote a heroic moonwalker some three decades ago, magnificent desolation.  Judge's performance in this film reveals the ever-growing quiet dignity that he has given Teal'c in the last 12 years, counting his recent ""Atlantis"" appearance.  Watching him struggle--injured, exhausted, in excruciating pain--to walk just one more step, and another, along a low-tide beach toward a holy city almost makes you feel his struggle come right through the TV.  His performance is exceptional.

Ultimately, I enjoyed this film and am happy that the Ori storyline is resolved.  How it is done so, you must see for yourself.  It's a thrilling and enjoyable conclusion.  Season 10 on Sci Fi did not accomplish this, but STARGATE:  THE ARK OF TRUTH does, and satisfyingly so.  And the bonus segment with most of the core cast at ComicCon in San Diego, hosted by one of my favorite but underutilized supporting cast members--Gary Jones (Chief Master Sgt. Walter Harriman, best known for a few lines  such as ""I can't get chevron seven to engage!"" and ""Unscheduled off-world activation!"")--is absolutely hysterical.  If Gary doesn't do stand-up, maybe he should consider it, now that he has, er, some ""free time"" on his hands.  (I have seen him in a few guest-starring roles recently, though.)  The bonuses aren't numerous, but those that are provided are made to count.

So sit back and enjoy, and don't forget!  In four months comes ""STARGATE:  CONTINUUM"" and ""RDA"" is back as Jack O'Neill!  Now THAT'S something to really get excited about!  :-)

DVD REVIEW:  **** (out of 5) -- 17 Mar 08 (Happy St. Patrick's Day, all!) -- BOB BOURBEAU",1205712000,9,13233,5.552566018933732
3057769,5,B0010YSD7M,"Please buy this DVD so they will make more SG-1 movies.  I would buy it again despite what I'm about to say.  The movie had its moments, and was visually stunning, but I couldn't get past the fact that they wrapped up 90 minutes of building story in less than 5 minutes, left major questions unanswered, and just got plain silly at the very end.  I miss this show very much, and honestly just about anything is better than nothing, so even though I was pretty disappointed overall this is the only place you'll hear me say it.",1205712000,,526,4.346938775510204
3057770,3,B0010YSD7M,"Sure, it was great to see the characters, more like old friends now,  that I've missed since Stargate SG-1 ended, but this long awaited TV movie felt more like two average episodes than anything like I hoped it would be.

I thought something was strange when the opening credits were white letters over white snow in the mountains.  Some very hard to even read. How did that get past someone?  Just a nit, but it made me wonder what I was in for.  Caution, spoilers follow.

First, I was disappointed that the story revolved around a magic weapon that solves all our problems if we can only find it, which of course we know we will eventually.  That made the whole adventure more or less predictable.

What follows is a lot of lets say very conveniently written stuff with some strange transitions.  We've got the Odyssey going through the Super Stargate in one scene and immediately Vala and Daniel are sitting at a table in a villiage in Ori occupied space.  That was easy.

Then here come the replicators, again.  Replicators have already been done in the SG-1 series, where they were an original idea to the series, and in Atlantis, where it made me think the Atlantis writers had run out of ideas, and now here they are again!  Once again we are treated to scene after scene of heavy and light machine guns mowing down replicators while the bullets do absolutely no damage to anything that isn't a replicator.  It got corny a while ago, folks.  By the way, why did the characters weld and bolt the doors to the Asgard Core room shut if it had already been established in the show that the little bugs can just melt their way through metal?

Then there's the new twist: the gross zombie replicator human, and the endless fight between this thing and Mitchell, which ends with the terminator (er..oops..replicators) forming a human skeleton after all the flesh has been burned away.

Why is it that all of a sudden these Ori mother ships aren't so tough, and four of them can pound away at the Odyssey for endless minutes while the replicator problem is taken care of, and then once the replicators are defeated the Ori ships all of a sudden become an urgent threat again?

How can Teal'c get a Ori weapon blast in the back, get left for dead, and in the morning feel great enough to go mountain climbing, complete with incredibly corny not-too-Stargate-like melodramatic music playing?  He falls flat on his face but gets supernatural help to recover.  Later, he somehow penetrates the Ori city and shows up in a Pryor's uniform to rescue our heros, but we never get to see how he did it!

One thing I forgot to mention at first, Samantha Carter seems to come across more like a soccer mom than a military person.  Maybe because her hair seemed long for a military person, or because she baked cookies for Mitchell and kissed him on the cheek while she had her hair completely down while on base at the end of the episode.  I don't know, but something seemed tweaked about Sam.  Of course, I'm not caught up on season four of Atlantis.

Finally, the super villian in this story is dispatched just the way the super villian Anubis is dispatched in the Threads episode.

Anyway, I thought will all the extra time available to make this movie I'd get to see something fresh and somewhat original, but it was the same old same old.  At least the Ori story arc was brought to a close.

Bottom line: see if you can see it without paying full retail.",1205625600,12,3447,4.525040387722132
3057771,4,B0010YSD7M,"I am a huge fan of Stargate SG-1, and own all 10 seasons on DVD.  I greatly appreciate that the Ori storyline was wrapped up in this movie, since there were a lot of dangling threads at the end of season 10.

Among the things I enjoyed:
- all of the actors did a great job, as usual, and there was excellent continuity with the series mythology (case in point, the Asgard core that was obtained in the final aired episode)
- excellent production values, especially entering the Supergate and Adria's flaming powers (though the series always did a great job of making every dollar count in special effects)
- the very best lines given to Christopher Judge in 10 years as Teal'c and Tomin discussed guilt and redemption
- the moving scene where Daniel breaks down, at the limit of his faith and endurance

Things I did not enjoy so much:
- the one-dimensional IOA bad guy
- some very big scene jumps that had me confused for a while (ie, after entering the Supergate, suddenly Vala, Daniel and Tomin are undercover on an Ori world meeting with the underground)
- bringing the replicators back was repetitive, and isolated Carter and Mitchell from the Ori saga
- the replicator-zombie was just gross, and not particulary original

After listening to the writer/producer/director's commentary, I wish he had spent less attention on production values and more on increasing the emotional resonance of the story.  The fact is, most fans have followed SG-1 so loyally because they love the characters, and would like to see their reactions and interactions with each other.  This story felt detached somehow -- I have felt much more invested in the characters in some of the season finales than in this movie, and the season finales were never short of action, so I was suprised that the writing didn't seem up to the same standard.  Without that emotional connection, the battle and even the victory seemed a bit hollow to me.

That said, it was wonderful to revisit with my favourite TV show again, and I hope they make more DVD movies!",1205625600,2,2031,4.701408450704226
3057772,5,B0010YSD7M,"Wow,  Just saw the movie today on my big screen.  Audio and Video were great.  I liked the story line and got to see all the characters back in familiar roles.  Liked the extended 2 hour format and I am hoping if the sales go well, then maybe the movies will continue.  Also, the bonus features on the disk were great as well.  From the making of the movie, to the comic con interviews in San Diego CA.  I agree with Ben Browder, that one fan can't carry a tune in a bucket.  Very entertaining overall and worth the money for me",1205625600,,528,4.107843137254902
3057773,2,B0010YSD7M,"After a year of waiting, a very disappointing 90-minute episode entitled ARK OF TRUTH is released with a $20 price tag.

I had expected the entire story to be devoted to the end of the Ori, but you will find only half the movie covering their final demise.  The other half resurrects an old villian from Stargate's past.  So what we end up with is a quick conclusion to the Ori storyline which ends exactly the same way as the Anubus storyline ended.  The rest of the movie has battle scenes we've seen before in many past episodes as they fight the old villian from their past.  And we also get a fight scene with Cameron against an unbeatable foe very similar to the Black Knight he fought in the Camelot episode.  Rent it before buying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1205625600,4,752,4.492647058823529
3057774,5,B0010YSD7M,"All I can say is, ""Wow!""  This film was a lot of fun and while the ending was just a little contrived it did what was intended: tied up the Ori storyline so the team can move on to other adventures.  First, let me say that I'm not one of those people who thinks the Sci Fi Channel was doing the bidding of Satan by cancelling Stargate SG-1.  It was time, in my opinion, for the long-running series to leave the air.  The Ori storyline, which I never liked, was dragging on forever and it seemed the writers of the series were just rehashing old sci-fi plot devices to fill out a full season.  Second, this film goes a long way to redeeming the Stargate franchise and reminding us just how great Stargate was in its heyday.  The only missing link in this film was an appearance by Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill.

One of the major positives about this movie is that each character gets his or her moments to shine.  Tel'c especially has a wonderful scene with Tomin in which they discuss the terrible things they've done and about the idea of forgiveness.  Probably was one of finest moments for Christopher Judge in years.  Another stand-out is the character of Cam Mitchell.  In his two years on the series I never really warmed to this character, which always surprised me since I'm such a huge fan of Ben Browder's performance in Farscape.  In this movie, I think the character really comes into his own as an individual and a leader.  Of course, Sam and Daniel have their great moments, and the saving grace of Stargate's final two seasons, Vala, is as funny and dramatic as ever. Claudia Black is truly an underused actress. Her scenes with Tomin (played wonderfully by Tim Guinee) are some of the best in the movie.

It goes without saying the special effects were as good or better than the series, which were already fantastic for something made on low-budget cable money.  It's also worth mentioning the music was great and reminded me a lot of the music in the original Stargate movie.

This is not the best film for new viewers of Stargate, but a nice prelude that catches you up is included on the DVD, so new viewers shouldn't stay away. What this film does is tie up the loose ends from season 10 of Stargate SG-1 and allow for the beginning of some new adventures.  I eagerly await the next film, Stargate: Continuum.",1205625600,4,2338,4.502369668246446
3057775,2,B0010YSD7M,"I bought this movie with high hopes that the writers, producers, and directors would take the direct to dvd movie series to the next level, beyond the television series - and was severely disappointed. There was very little in this dvd that felt like a movie, with the exception of 1 or 2 cuss words (rather contrived way to separate the movie from the tv show), and the opening sequence which did have a broad, sweeping feel to it.

There were 2 other scenes which felt ""larger"" than a tv episode - one we had seen in the trailers (where the production company spent most of the 7 million dollar budget on special effects) as the ship moves through the SuperGate. The other is Teal'c journey across miles of beautiful and breathtaking terrain to find the rest of his team.

But none of that was nearly enough to sway my overall opinion of this stretched out episdoe.

If you are a Cam Mitchell fan, buy the movie. If you enjoy movies with over extended battle and fight scenes - and I mean scenes that NEVER seem to end, buy the movie.

However, if you are expecting to see a movie with a storyline that is full of character development and interaction between the leads, give this one a big MISS.

The plot holes in this story are large enough to drive a Mack Truck through.  The largest one, Teal'c wakes up after being shot in a fight and knows - precisely - which direction to take to find the rest of the team?  Even though they have been carted miles and miles away?  I found myself actually exclaiming outloud - what a Load! during that scene. The Jaffa suddenly has esp or something? Is this some sort of side effect of long term exposure to Tretonin?  Whatever.

I had hoped to see something that felt more like a movie and less like an episode - but should have known better when the same people who wrote, directed, and produced the series worked on this project and the next upcoming direct to DVD movie - Continuum. Even with Richard Dean Anderson's appearance in that film, I will most likely rent it before I buy it in an attempt to avoid a $19.99 mistake.",1205625600,5,2072,4.400523560209424

I don't know why I couldn't connect with Ben Browder's character since I'm a huge fan of his work.  But, somehow in the Ark of Truth he pulled off bringing Mitchell into my heart as much as O'Neil.

This movie kept me in suspense and suprised me more that I thought it would.  Well done!",1205539200,2,685,4.067164179104478
3057781,2,B0010YSD7M,"As a fan who has watched the show from the beginning and has loved it all along, I must say that this film was overall a disappointment.

But let me start with some positives.  The production values of the film were awesome, and I loved the location filming in the mountains.  The photography in this was quite beautifully done.  And the actors did magnificent as always.  I also liked the elements of the story involving Tomin and his facing the actions he took as an Ori soldier, with Teal'c being the one most interested in and capable of helping him through it.  This also gave Christopher Judge a chance to really show his dramatic acting capabilities, when most of the time his role is based more on physicality.

But beyond that, I thought that the film had three major flaws that detracted from the quality and enjoyability of the film.  One-the whole plot device of the Ark of Truth was an overly simplistic solution to the Ori problem.  Open a box, let a Prior see it, and all the Ori followers will see the error of their ways and be nice from now on.  Come on!!  I know that they had to come up with some kind of simplified solution to the Ori problem because they didn't have a whole season to wrap the story, but this was a just plain stupid idea!

Two-bringing back the replicators!!  As soon as I saw that metallic bug, I hung my head and went ""Argh, give me a (bleeping) break!""  The replicators were a lot of fun for a villain back when they were first introduced, but at this point, they have just gotten old!  I'm sick of them!  They've almost become an excuse for them to bring out big guns with really big ammo magazines so they can show a plethera of clips of really loud guns being fired by really cool looking dudes!  They could've thrown in Jean Claude Van Damm and made this a B action film.  I think if they had focused on the Ori story instead of devoting a full third of the film to the replicators, the film might have been much better served!  Instead, I felt like I had seen all of the replicator stuff before.  Of course, I had, in Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and a whole lot in Season 8!

Third-the replicator element brings us to the final problem I had with this film-Replicator Man!  At least, that's what I like to call the replicator-controlled zombie that Colonel Mitchell fights.  Through this whole sequence, I thought I was watching some cheesy zombie film mixed in with a little action-movie style fight scenes.  Replicator Man was a stupid enough plot device on its own, but then the sequence dragged on and on and on.  Only Ben Browder's whit in between the punches kept me even partially interested.

As I said, disappointing film overall that had some good points, but was rather poorly executed in terms of writing and plot.  Here's hoping for something better with Continuum.",1205539200,48,2818,4.453125

There are not many shows I watch but SG-1, SGA, BSG, Firefly, X Files, & Terminator SCC are the type of shows I am interested in with SG-1 & SGA my favorites.

I have only watched AoT once (and the extra features) but the imagery and on location scenery including sets are wonderful. Character interaction, trademark humor, and pace of the episode/movie are great. Great action sequences and FX. When I watch it again I am sure I will enjoy it as much or more.

Any show or movie will have some flaws but overall Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis have been thoroughly fantastic for me and I dread the eventuality of NO new shows or movies from SG. In this current time, how else will I be able to travel off world to explore new planets?",1205539200,,1016,4.30890052356021
3057786,5,B0010YSD7M,"If you are reading this, yes, all night 4 times... no, not that, I have seen it 4x now.  A lot of ""answers"" packed into an epic style true movie with dynamic visuals and sound.  As a fan for all 10 years and all 10 seasons on DVD... I'm liken this a lot.

Cam and Sam lead the way with Cam really coming into his SG-1 role as leader and commander and he does it very well and naturally.  Something that took 2 seasons to come into, but he does with great satisfaction.

Sam continues well and as expected in a true to character role as a declared ""I got your back"" team member.  Have you noticed she addresses Cam as ""Cam"" and not sir?  I never heard her say ""Jack"".  These two continue the first name basis.  If you've notice the last few season a very subtle affection growing between Sam and Cam, it continues here with a closing scene that is ""just right"", but I could see more in the next production.  It's clear she accepts his leadership and is fond of him all at the same time while not breaking regulations.  She is a bit ""sexier"" a few times too.

Daniel is true blue also nothing out of character, but finally manages to get the Ancients to cooperate and interven on behalf of human kind... finally.

Teal'c also is spot on in his traditional role in doing anything he can to forge ahead, enduring, strong, spiritual and finally ""helped"" by a ""touch"" from the Ancients too.  Nice.

Vala, except for the first scene, finally ""settles down"" and is less annoying in this 'episode' than so many of the others.  She is finally a full team member, is receptive and ""tuned in"" to Daniel while handling her relationship with all her men with calm and maturity... nice to see as her previous ""methods"" always kept me ""away"" from liking her character.

All the rest of the cast and crew are here too, no one is left out and Landry, Walter and others all do their ""standard"" stuff, no tricks.

Morgan Lafay finally reveals all with Daniel, cooperates with him after his torture, has mercy and finally... finally steps in on behalf of the Ancients.  Divine intervention that is the only way to deal with Adria.  I identify with this personally as I often feel things could ""work out"" here on earth IF we could just get some help once in awhile.

No spoilers here, but the IOA finally ""intrudes"" in a way that almost costs us our human civilization in the Milky Way Galaxy by hijacking the ""approved"" mission to find the Ark with an alternative ""plan"" set forth in a ""rogue"" fashion that proves to be catostrophic and Sam and Cam gotta deal with the Replicators... yes, again.

No ""alternate reality"" stuff either... straight on adventure and challenges that all ends well and leaves me feeling ""satisfied"" after 10 years with my favorite TV show ever.  ""They"" could have made a mistake trying to be spectacular to extreme and go overboard, but this is an epic long adventure that's true to a movie form with action and adventure and ""hanging on till the end"" and that is the way it should be and the way ""we all"" want to remember this great series.",1205539200,3,3047,4.440647482014389
3057787,3,B0010YSD7M,"The ""Ark of Truth"" is basically what should have/would have been 3 or even 4 episode had the series continued on television.
But it's not.  It's a rather hurried 100 minutes of a mixed story line retreading the same themes: replicators endangering the ship and crew, the ""evil"" manipulations of the IOA, the uncompleted Ori story line, the small band of humans overcoming impossible odds to save the galaxy and mankind etc.
Frankly it leaves lot's of plot questions unanswered by its conclusion, just too many gaps in the story along with inconsistencies with the ""Stargate history"".  It does have some of the back story explaining the issues between the Ori and the Ancients and the creation of the Ark.

Robert Cooper wrote, directed and produced this direct to DVD video. I find doing all three things generally doesn't lead to better movies or videos.  Besides the weak story and plot line, the dialog is rather flat compared to numerous other SG-1 episodes.  Based on reviews I've seen, SG-1 fans will likely enjoy the DVD movie, but it is not the best effort of the series.

Image quality is good and looks nice upscaled by a Toshiba HD-A20 on a 62inch screen.  The accompanying sound track is ok.

PS
Have not yet watched the story behind extra (the DVD is really light in extras).  The prelude is a quick set of snippet from the entire Ori story arc, but is just that snippets (or visual sound bites).  It does nothing to advance the story.

Ark of Truth was good. Not great. I really like the actors and the characters they portray. The effects were up there and the interesting Ori story arc was closed nicely. HOWEVER, there was nothing new here. It was an extended episode. What was worse was the whole plot thread that seemed to be added by a fan of the Terminator. It was cheap and a waste.

Yeah, I can say I was very pleased with the movie and hope they make a new feature length film with this cast every year or so.

Stargate - The Ark of Truth is a real treat for SG-1 fans everywhere. For a start you can really see the quality difference between the series and the movie. It also seems as if the script writers had more time to ensure that each characters idiosyncrasies came out more than in the series. Christopher Judge, in particular, is given a plumb piece of dialog delivered with just the right amount of gravitas.

3057804,5,B0010YSD7M,"This review is spoiler free!!

I have to preface this review with the statement that I am an avid Stargate fan, and as such, my review may be biased (but I think not!)

After enduring season 4 of Atlantis this year, it is nice to get back to the show I truly love, Sg-1.  Opposed to Atlantis, SG-1 takes place on earth, spends time on the explorations, and takes into account ancient mythologies, opposed to Atlantis, which is more action oriented, with dumbed down dialog, and shooting anything that moves.

I have been awaiting this release since it was announced, it finally came to my home yesterday, I watched the movie, then the extras (comic con conference which was really cool! and a behind the scenes which was great as well (this is almost 1 hour of material), I then watched the movie again, this time with commentary (again, I love SG-1).

This dvd has a ""prelude"" which basically goes over everything you need to freshen up on to fully enjoy and prepare for this viewing.  As someone who has seen each episode of stargate countless times, I found this prelude a great review, as it has been a while since I watched it all.

The movie then follows, and it is a great movie. The scenery in this movie is astounding, it looks much better than we are used to seeing on the TV show.  The pacing is slower, more akin to when the show aired on Showtime, which works well, as the aspect of stargate that i enjoy most, is the interactions between the characters, the explorations of new worlds and civilizations, and how everyone reacts to the culture.

This brings the conclusion to a satisfying end.  I think several of the cliffhangers are drawn out a bit much (putting a tad too much tension near the end), but all in all, I enjoyed the movie.

This reminds me of why I love this show, I know they are coming out with another movie soon (this one will have Richard Dean Anderson in it), and word on the streets is, it should arrive this July.

I truly hope people are not just downloading bootleg copies of this dvd, and I really hope everyone will buy this dvd, and the next one.  I really want this show to continue on, if the studios do not get the results they are looking for, this could be the end.

I really hope the dvds do sell well, maybe they can continue to do movies throughout the year, and maybe even a mini series or another season.  There are many aspects of the Stargate world that have gone unexplored, and unfinished.

I hope the producers read this review, and understand that what make stargate work is not the snappy dialog, the wonderful interactions, the brilliantly designed enemies, sound design, artwork, and constant tension, but the exploration of new worlds, the ability to learn something (ancient history, see ancient figures, the Egyptian gods) and the exploration of these foreign cultures.  Something Stargate Atlantis completely misses, which is why I do not enjoy it as much.

I truly hope everyone will buy this dvd, enjoy it, and more get made.

I also must comment on the beautiful video quality and sound design, the show has never looked or sounded this good (they did use 35mm film) and it shows.

Please keep up the great work, and I hope everyone enjoys this fantastic dvd.

(note, if you are a fan of the movie, and haven't watched too much of the series (last 2 seasons--9 and 10) this dvd is likely not for you, do yourself a favor, and buy the complete series collection, and catch up, then enjoy this fantastic dvd, as you will not be able to understand much of what is going on)

Also, the creators of the show, are working on a third show, that deals with the ninth chevron, tentatively called ""Stargate Universe"" which is set in present time.  I really hope this will be the return of intellectual Stargate, and I eagerly await its arrival on TV.",1205366400,101,3809,4.512372634643377
3057805,4,B0010YSD7M,"First a note to fans of the 1994 MOVIE:
If you are not familiar with Stargate SG-1 the television show, this is not the movie for you.  In case you are unsure of what this product is, it's a continuation of the Television series of the same name.  If you've only seen the movie, you'll want to start with the first season DVD of SG1.

Now on to the review:
Overall I think this was a very enjoyable film.  It picks up right where the final season had ended.  It deals mostly with the ORI and serves to wrap up that story arc.  The production values were very high and when it was all said and done, I had a very good time.  That doesn't mean there weren't issues, though.  But most are pretty minor and not worth nit-picking here.

The Plot (No Spoilers Version):
SG1 is looking for an Ancient artifact called the Ark of Truth (obviously) in the hopes that it will help them to defeat the Ori, a race of ascended zealots who feed off the worship of their ... well, worshipers.

The story takes us to several familiar settings and sees the return of many popular characters from the 9th and 10th seasons of the show.  It also adds some new faces as well!  Sadly, Richard Dean Anderson does not make an appearance as Jack O'Neill.  Robert Picardo is also absent (now part of the Atlantis mission) as Woozy.  However the rest of the SG1 gang is all here.

Fans of the Star Gate SG1 series will definitely want to add this film to their collection.  You'll easily be able to overlook it's shortcomings and enjoy it for what it is ... a film about our favorite characters from a great series and a wrap up to 10 great years of television.  I look forward to seeing what they have coming next with their release of Continuum this summer!",1205366400,3,1731,4.309597523219814
3057806,4,B0010YSD7M,"The Ark of Truth is supposed to tie up all the hanging storylines from the sadly cancelled Stargate series.  However, there are still unresolved stories -- like whatever happened to the Harsesis (spelling correct?) child, or Laira from A Hundred Days, or the Tok'ra.  Were all the Tolans really killed, so whatever happened to Schroedinger the cat?  What about the Furlings, and who are the enemy/rescuers in episodes Enemies and Grace?  The Ori story thankfully comes to an end, but not a spectacular one.  It would have been far more interesting to have gotten all the Ancients to finally have battled the Ori, but the writers didn't go there.  Still, this episode is quite good, with really fine acting from Shanks and Tapping and Judge.  For the Farscape cast, Claudia Black seems a bit out of character, like she's tired of Vala (so am I) -- and a grinning Tomin doesn't seem quite right either -- but Browder does well, right in character, though he does get beaten up a lot.  The soundtrack is often intrusive, as if they want you to know that this is a true film and not just part of the series, where the soundtrack never intruded.  And there are portions that include singing like Gregorian chants, okay if you like that stuff but annoying otherwise.  Sorry to say, the writers also brought back an old, dead plot element -- it seems like whenever they don't know what to do, either in SG-1 or Atlantis, they resurrect the replicators.  Ho-hum.  And at the end, they could have spent a bit more time building the drama, since for me it fell a little flat.  I did enjoy Beau Bridges, who is the best of the Stargate generals.  Despite some disappointments, though, it's an entertaining episode, although I have to admit the the second time I viewed it, I got a little bored . . .",1205366400,6,1788,4.581761006289308

 I liked the movie and it is good to have closure of the season 10 plot line. I have been a long time fan and while I am not fond of the Cameron Mitchell and Vala characters I suppose they served to help carry the plot in Rick Dean's absence. Besides, ""props"" must be given to Farscape and if this is what it takes for them to pay the bills, I will play along.

 All in all this is a must buy if you want to close the story arc of season 10.",1205366400,2,559,3.8859649122807016
3057808,5,B0010YSD7M,"Quite honestly, a lot of the time a film that gets high reviews just doesn't live up to the hype.  Fortunately, this wasn't one of them!  In part because of the other reviews on this site, and in part because of the quality of the show, I went into the experience with high expectations.  I'm glad to say that the movie did NOT disappoint!

The writers, cast, and crew did an excellent job wrapping up the loose ends from the series (although because of the timing of the releases, I'm a bit confused about where the movie exists -- with Carter LEADING Atlantis AND still an active member of SG-1, I'm trying to figure out how she seems to be in two places at the same time...) and the end of the movie is very satisfying.  (When it ended, all I could think was ""And... THAT's why I love this show!"" == with a bit of Mitchell's enthusiasm...)

Unfortunately, there isn't much here for viewers who haven't been following the series -- especially the last few seasons.  So if you're looking to start with a movie, my suggestion would be to begin with either the original Stargate film or with the pilot for the first season.

There ARE a few surprises for fans, though, even while they are working to wrap up the series.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bigger budget shows in the quality of the sound and picture.  One nice thing about the longer format (aside from just getting more of the good stuff) is that they took the time to really develop the film and bring everything together without it seeming like they wrapped everything up in the last five or ten minutes with a deus ex or some other plot contrivance.

In short, if you're a fan of the series, you have GOT to buy this!  (This is my first review on Amazon.com, and I felt like I just HAD to say something.  If any of the writers, cast, or crew happen to read this, GREAT job!)",1205280000,,1843,4.353801169590644
3057809,5,B0010YSD7M,"Spoilers are fun, but I'm going to be careful not to give anything away here, since not everyone agrees with me about the fun thing. I have to say up front that I loved the movie, not so much because it was the best episode of the series but because this was the series wrap-up that was missing from the final episodes of season 10. I liked how the arcs came together and how the characters seemed just as easy to like as always. The action was dramatic and exciting and drove the story to a satisfying conclusion.

If you liked Tomin from the series, you'll enjoy seeing him again here. He plays a key role, and I was thrilled to see his character again. I also liked the parallels between him and Teal'c.

I imagine the show will be easy to watch again and I'm already looking forward to seeing certain scenes replayed.

Despite my love of Stargate and my love of this show, it had its flaws.

To be frank, I thought most of the tricks that were meant to make the movie more like a ""real"" movie were a waste of time and storytelling space. Thinking back, I must say that this wasn't any better (if not even as good) as many of the two part episodes from the series, such as The Lost City, Full Circle, Exodus/Enemies, and others.

Many of the characters seemed to be stick figures. Landry's part in the movie could just as easily have been left out for all but one scene. Teal'c's ""walk"" seemed unlikely at best, and blatantly ridiculous at worst. The difference between the feel of the movie and the series jarred.

However, I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Stargate SG-1. It's a lovely tribute to the last two years of the series.",1205280000,3,1660,4.373376623376624
3057810,1,B0010YSD7M,"I used to love Stargate.  But maybe it was the departure of Richard Dean Anderson, I don't know.  But the last few seasons have been extremely repetitive and tiresome.  Random Ancient artifact saves the day.  The Ark of Truth is no exception.  The only character that gets any decent character development is Tomin when he has a change of heart.  Otherwise it's the same ole tired formula.  1) Find Ancient artifact.  2) magically decipher it despite how ridiculously old and advanced it is. 3) Save the day.  4) Lather rinse repeat.  It was bad enough that the first seasons of Stargate dealt with Humans miraculously defeating an enemy that was vastly more advanced and had been in power for thousands of years.  But my suspension of disbelief simply cannot tolerate simple humans fighting virtual deities and somehow winning.  It is extremely disappointing to see Stargate fall so far.",1205280000,15,888,4.925675675675675

Just to see Stargate Atlantis and a couple other shows.
The movie The Ark of Truth should be a huge success.  It is well acted and the music score is outstanding. I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the whole movie as things went from bad to worse for SG1.  Before seeing that there is another movie pending, I was concerned that SG1 was going to get killed off in a way similar to what was done to Farscape.

Being a very big fan of the series, I must say that this was somewhat of a disappointment.  There was enough in this 102 minute movie to expand into at least one season.  Another annoying thing about the movie is that the Replicators, which I consider to be the best enemy in all of Stargate Sg-1, was introduced and are defeated in the same movie?  If they wanted to bring the Replicators back, they should have had a seperate movie for the Replicators.  The Replicators also made it so that the only people actually helping at all at finding the Ark of Truth are Daniel, Vala, and Tealc.  Sam and Cam are busy fighting the Replicators and don't contribute that much to the Ori ending.  It was good, but I had seen several season finales that were much better than this movie.",1205280000,4,788,4.4375
3057815,5,B0010YSD7M,"Leaving the Ori storyline unresolved at the end of Sg-1's final season, the makers of the show give us this film. The Ark Of Truth lives up the hype of fans hoping for an epic end to the storyline that drove the show's final two seasons.  Indeed, The Ark Of Truth proves to be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline.

In fact one might go so far as to assume that the show never ended. From the performances of SG-1's members, it's just like picking up where Unending left off. In particular Michael Shanks and Ben Browder both get to shine in their roles of Daniel Jackson and Cameron Mitchell. That's not to say the rest of cast doesn't, but Shanks and Browder really do stand out in this. The supporting cast does too from Beau Bridges to Sarah Strange, from Sarah Strange to the villainous Julian Sands and the absolutely evil Morena Baccarin. The real stand out of the supporting cast however is Currie Graham as Merrick, the double crossing IOA supervisor.

The rest of the production is also first rate for the film, in both writing and production values, is epic. There is a scope to the film that wasn't possible for the show on television. The story feels epic, taking us from Earth to the Ori galaxy and back again. The story has so much going on though that we don't get to see some of the things fans would like to have seen but we see enough to keep everyone happy. The effects and photography aren't just as good as they were on the show, they're better. They go from mountains in the opening credits, the ruins of Dakarra and the Altaran city, to the Ark itself: something that was hard (if not impossible) for the series to do with even a two-part two of the series. There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. There's one other thing to mention: the music. The music by Joel Goldsmith is just as epic as the film, evoking not just the original Stargate theme by David Arnold but the Germanic chants of the Ori themes and heroic themes for the team. But the real treat of the music is that while it may be familiar, you've never heard it played this. Fans of the series won't be disappointed. Everything that made us love the series is still here and thriving.

Not to say the film is perfect, which it isn't. Some parts of the film don't make a lot of sense such as the IOA's actions. They don't make much sense especially when they resurrect an old enemy from the series in the process. I won't spoil it because it makes for a great plot twist, but in retrospect it just feels like padding. There's also the odd flashbacks to the Altarans involving the Ark which, while they add some texture, really might not have been needed. But these are minor flaws, and its hard to find anything without any.

The DVD has bonus features for any of the series to enjoy. From Comic-Con to a making of documentary, fans get the chance to go behind the scenes of the film and its promotion. There's also a short semi-preview of the second direct to DVD SG-1 movie to tease fans with. But the mains tar of the bonus features is the commentary by writer/director Robert C. Cooper, cinematographer Peter Woeste, and actor Christopher Judge. Their commentary talks about not just the making of the film, but the attempts to make the film larger and better then the series and the difficulties in doing so. For fans the commentary is a must-hear.

In short, The Ark Of Truth is a good film. It does exactly what it was supposed to do: be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline. It succeeds for the most part, though it does have some flaws to it. While non-fans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catch-up on all the plotlines going on in the film, fans should enjoy it. If this and Continuum, the yet to be released second film, are to be the final end of Stargate SG-1, they will be the fitting end of the series.",1205280000,5,3931,4.356070941336971
3057816,4,B0010YSD7M,"Beginning with the opening credits, 'Stargate - The Ark of Truth' shows that writer/producer/director Robert Cooper wants this movie to be more than just an extended version of the SG-1 television show. Does he succeed in turning the SG-1 world into a full length movie? To a large degree, yes, and he does it while remaining true to the spirit and flavor of the TV series.

'Coop' (familiar to many SG-1 viewers as a writer since first season) uses much of his expanded budget to bring a cinematic quality to the movie.  Some gorgeous panoramic mountain scenes back the opening credits, and later in the film he drops a major character on the same mountain tops to be shot via helicopter, reminiscent of some of the photography in Jackson's Lord of the Rings. Unlike the later episodes of the TV series which were shot in HD video, the Ark of Truth was shot on 35 mm film like a feature film, and it shows in the richness of the cinematography (by Peter Woeste, Director of Photography on the TV series). The special effects in the SG-1 series have almost always been high quality, but in the movie the extra budget shows up in the extended CGI work. Composer Joel Goldsmith (also with the show since the first season) is allowed to work with a full orchestra, and his music is a great support to the onscreen action and moods. As the opening credits roll, you may notice a difference in the SG-1 theme song reminiscent of the original Stargate feature film - a very effective way to bring a larger and slightly different feel to the Ark of Truth, and a good example of the handling of the transition from TV to movie.

The premise is fairly simple - tie up the Ori story arc that was left hanging in season 10. The basic plot is predictable since we are shown the potential solution to the Ori problem in an opening scene flashback to the million year old civilization of the Alterans, but the fun is in getting there. The various twists that occur manage to split the team up and put the members of SG-1 into the usual tight spots, something viewers of the series are familiar with. This kind of development is true to the flavor of the series since its first season. Some will be disappointed at the return of an old nemesis, but others will appreciate it as a nostalgic complication to an already hopeless situation.

The actors brought their well-established characters to this movie, and there's not a bad performance in the bunch. Their enjoyment of working with each other, and their off-screen friendships, are very evident as on-screen chemistry. Samantha Carter (played by Amanda Tapping) was a bit underutilized, but her character performs the usual miracles under pressure. Cam Mitchell (Ben Browder) amusingly accepts command of the Odyssey for the voyage to the Ori galaxy, and manages to quip humorously even as he gets the life beat out of him. Vala Maldoran (Claudia Black) is her usual sarcastic, slightly devious, yet vulnerable and funny self. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) gives a very strong emotional performance in one scene, demonstrating the personal toll that the whole ancient/ascension experience has taken on him over the years. And Teal'c (Christopher Judge) addresses the issue of how he has dealt with (or not dealt with) his past, where he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. It provides the motivation for the act he performs later in the movie, which is one of Tealc's great moments in the SG-1 mythology.

Viewers of the series will recognize other regulars and guests, including Beau Bridges (General Landry), Gary Jones (Chief Master Sergeant Walter Harriman), Morena Baccarin (Vala's daughter Adria), Eric Brecker (Colonel Reynolds), Martin Christopher (Major Marks), Doug Abrahams (Prior #2), and Julian Sands as the Doci. There are two special guest appearances of note. Tim Guinee reprises his recurring series role as Tomin, husband of Vala in the Ori galaxy. He gives an excellent performance beginning where the series left off, as a true believer in Origin, but a doubting agent of the priors, and he grows throughout the movie to become an ally with a special bond to Teal'c. Currie Graham plays Merrick, a very unlikable ex-CIA operative turned agent of the bureaucratic I.O.A., who is responsible for some major peril SG-1 faces. I won't spoil it for you, but his character is dealt with in a very satisfying manner. ;-)

The DVD includes a commentary track with Robert Cooper, Peter Woeste, and Christopher Judge that is reasonably informative and entertaining. Special features include a filmed panel discussion at a recent Comic-Con that will have you laughing out loud, and a good 'making-of' documentary. There is also a 'Prelude to the Ark of Truth', which recaps the entire Ori story arc from the series; very helpful if you have not watched the shows in a while. The packaging is good with a sturdy plastic case in a cardboard sleeve.

I found little to complain about with this DVD, but it is not perfect. As attractive as the cinematography is, I think Cooper probably spent a little too much time and money trying to bring a cinematic feel to the movie when the extra screen time would have been better spent dealing with the story and characters.  There are the usual 'homages' to other movies which can come across as unoriginal, but the series has always been full of these, and the writers/directors have always taken great pleasure in emulating shots from their favorite movies. (Look for nods to ""Star Wars"", ""The Terminator"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in this one.) There is a scene where the use of a slanted view from a shaky handheld camera is distracting and seems inappropriate to the moment, but most of the camera work is superb and matches the mood.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that the movie tries to fit so much into a limited time that it feels rushed. I found myself wishing for more details on the Alteran civilization, more of the usual SG-1 exploration, and more character moments.  As it is, the story could easily have taken 3 episodes of the TV series, and with expanded details and more character beats, even more. But it is better for a movie to make you want more, than making you want it to end earlier.

Bottom line, this is well-produced fun entertainment, with characters you can care about, with enough action to keep it moving, while remaining true to the spirit of the SG-1 world. And most importantly, I found it to be a satisfying (if rushed) ending to the Ori story arc.  If you have not seen the series, you will definitely be confused, even after watching the 'Prelude' first. If you are someone that feels the series went south after Richard Dean Anderson left, then you won't like this movie because it deals with the SG-1 of the last two seasons.  In that case you might want to check out the latest SG-1 movie 'Continuum' where Don Davis and R.D.A. make brief appearances.

5 stars for cinematography and acting, 4 starts for story line, 3 stars for originality and pace.  Give it a 4 overall.  All in all, this is a good ending to the series, and a good beginning for more direct-to-disk releases.  I hope the DVD does well enough that more will be made in the future.",1205280000,,7213,4.734661354581673

Standing on its own, it is a must-own for any Stargate fan.  Closes with a few questions unanswered (not related specifically to the Ori), but not in an irritating way like the X-Files movie did.

The cinematography and other production values were WAY better than most of the movies I've seen in theaters in the last few years.  This is not your father's direct-to-DVD movie.

The prelude (which can be skipped entirely, viewed on its own, or viewed as an intro to the movie) was a nice ""Previously on Stargate SG-1,"" but it's not enough of a Cliff's Notes to introduce someone to SG-1.

3057819,4,B0010YSD7M,"Ark of Truth is a must see for fans of the series. It concludes the Ori battle and yet ends with SG-1 starting another mission. Something SG-1 has not had time to do for a couple years. Let's face it most of us have missed Jack and the exploring they use to do. The bulk of the movie is finding a weapon to destroy the Ori, but it turns out it is not where they first thought and when they find it, it doesn't do what they originally thought either. However they are victorious and there are changes of loyalty from a place you might not expect. Overall I was not at all disappointed, but I must admit the scene with Teal'c walking across a desert after being shot by a Ori weapon was a bit much.

The wife and I were a bit disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't even put in a cameo appearance. Excellent production values as always, they won't seem better as the TV series was so good that we were all spoiled by them. The DVD includes plenty of extras including a prelude you can play previous to watching the movie. The prelude is snapshot segments from several episodes from the last two seasons and that lead up to the final battle. I bought a copy because I loved the series and it wouldn't be complete without this movie. They made it clear another movie is in the works.

3057820,5,B0010YSD7M,"Got my copy yesterday, watched it last night. In short, it's really damn good! If you've watched Stargate over the years you'll not want to miss this.

No spoilers here, but they do a decent job of tying up the loose ends in the Ori saga, or at least as good a job as you can do in 1.5 hours. Remember, it took them 40 episodes over 2 seasons (30 hours of video) to lead up to this, so in some ways I with they'd taken at least 120 minutes to tie it up, but it's still well worth the watch. It's got all the classic interplay between the characters, the comedy, the tension, the action, it just reinforces why we all loved this series, and how nuts SciFi was to not renew it. Maybe they'll see the error of their ways? :)

Production quality is superb, the wide shots w/the mountain ranges are amazing, and as several have said, only a feature affords them the time and $$ to make shots like this. Special effects are great, and some of the explosion scenes are quite interesting, especially after you watch the DVD extras and see how they did it.

Speaking of bonus material, the bit at comic-con is absolutely hilarious. Gary Jones (Chief Mst Sgt. Walter Harriman, you know, the ""receiving IDC"" guy) MCs it, and while I get the occasional chuckle out of SG1, I had a couple of out-loud laughs at this Q&A w/the cast of SG1 (well, except for  Michael Shanks (Daniel) who was, well, you'll see).

One thing... please, please, please tell me they filmed this in HD and there will be a BlueRay Director's cut released after Continuum later this year.

Bottom line... BUY IT NOW!",1205280000,4,1576,4.38013698630137
3057821,5,B0010YSD7M,"Stargate: Ark of Truth marks the first of at least two movies, direct to DVD, that reunites the cast of SG1.  Daniel Jackson has had a vision of a weapon that will finally give Earth the ability to defeat the evil Ori.  SG1 sets out to recover the item and once and for all defeat the Ori.  This is a pretty standard plot for the series.

Is it very original?  No.  Does it sometimes feel rushed?  Yes, much as the ending to story arcs in the TV show often felt rushed.  Is it a whole lot of fun?  Oh, yeah, you better believe it.  Action, humor, cool special effects, and great characters are all things which permeated SG1 the tv series and the movie is no exception.  As a bonus, more refined cinematography and better sets help the viewer to feel like he is watching a true feature length movie.

The DVD has a few extra features; there is a great segment from a comic convention that is really funny (Browder, Tapping, and Judge answer fan questions), and the making of featurette provides a great look at how the film was made.

If you liked all ten seasons of SG1, you will love this movie.  If you were never much of a fan of the show, or if you didn't like the Ori story arc, then this movie probably won't interest you.

3057824,5,B0010YSD7M,"This film, the baby of Stargate franchise writer and producer Robert C. Cooper, proves that direct to DVD is a viable second life for Stargate SG-1. While the film manages to just reach ""big screen"" production values, it really feels like an extended length episode - and that's not a bad thing. It feels good, and familiar.

Regular viewers know the plot line of this story arc, and want to see the resolution that the Sci-Fi cable channel preempted by canceling the show. The movie does not disappoint here. The loose ends are tied up, with a couple of new twists added to the mix to keep the audience on their toes. All of the character relationships are intact and the canon of the show has not been violated in the slightest. For viewers who know Stargate SG-1, but aren't familiar with the arc of this story line, a ""Previously on Stargate SG-1"" extended prelude sequence is provided. As a regular viewer of the franchise, I even found it helpful in jogging the memory of a few plot points from season 9 of the series.

With the actors being completely comfortable in their characters, the performances are just what the Stargate viewer wants. Cooper does a very good job of directing  actors and a story he's very familiar with. The movie was made using film cameras, as opposed to the more recent use of the Hi-Def video format of the series. As good as Hi-Def ""film"" is, there IS something about 35 mm film resolution that lends to the big scale feel of the movie. The visual effects, having been completed by Stargate's in-house facility, are familiar and comfortable. But, their scale is wider and more time has obviously been invested in ensuring the visuals live up to ""movie"" standards.

The only criticism I would make is that the pacing occasionally DID feel like this was an episode, rather than a movie - a bit ironic in as much as much was made by the producers and cast about how liberating the ""2 hour"" format was. Two particular sequences seemed a bit glossed over, with one character setting off without a solid explanation of ""how,"" while the situation three other characters find themselves in doesn't get treated with enough depth. But, that is minor, because the third act sets up a scenario that places most of the leading characters into great danger. Even though we know that the resolution will be successful, it doesn't take away from the jeopardy because of the earlier mentioned completely unexpected plot twist. Act 4 resolves the story and set SG-1 up for further adventures in this direct to disc format.

The disc itself has wonderful ""special features,"" including the treat of watching the actors, as themselves, at the ComicCon convention in San Diego. Having attended one Creative produced Stargate convention, with the opportunity to meet and hear stories from Michael Shanks and Christopher Judge, I know how much fun the folks at the San Diego convention had.

I feel that my enthusiasm and money was well spent on this film, and that it was worth the wait. I certainly don't find paying such a small price for more SG-1 movies, and I think MGM and the Stargate brain trust at The Bridge have found a wonderful way of keeping the shows alive.  I'm looking forward to the upcoming ""Stargate Continuum"" release in July, and hope that the production team can get another film in the pipeline soon.",1205193600,2,3338,4.715265866209262
3057825,4,B0010YSD7M,"I have been a huge Stargate fan since the beginning.  When the series ended it felt incomplete.  The current story arc was not finished.  This movie did what it needed to do:  it put a satisfying bow on the package.

This extended episode has all the elements that made Stargate a phenomenal series.  As always, the writing and dialogue are excellent, the characters have fun and interact well, the sets and effects are what we have come to expect, the plot was fast paced and interesting, and there were balanced amounts of humor and tension and of action and science.  The musical underscoring was superb.  It added to the story, and was delightful to listen to.  And of course, good triumphs over evil, and our heroes ride off to their next adventure, hinting at even more to come.

There are only two minor issues with The Ark of Truth.  1.  No Jack.  I really like the new SG-1, but I miss Jack.  2.  As stated earlier, the movie completes the Ori story arc, but it did no more.  It had all the excellent elements of the series, but no more.  As a movie, I would have expected them to go farther than they would in an episode, to be even bigger and better.

SG-1 ended on a high note, with a cast that had amazing chemistry. And as one who owns all ten seasons of SG-1, I have to say that the last season was my favorite.  With the same wonderful humor, action, and special effects, the Ark of Truth makes for a super-charged, thrilling continuation of the one of the greatest and longest running science fiction shows in American history.

I originally thought it would be the same length as a two-part SG1 episode but was pleased to see it had a running length of something like 1 hour 43 minutes.

The whole thing was well done and exciting.

My only complaint is why wasn't it released on Blu-Ray?",1204502400,5,305,4.315789473684211

Even though I have already seen this, I am buying it. The only way they will continue to make these made for video movies is if we the fan buy them.

Anyway, the story was good and so was the pacing. I really enjoyed the effects and they'll probably look even better once this goes to Blue-Ray, that is if they plan on giving it an HD transfer.

I realize many of you haven't had the opportunity to see this yet since it won't come out until March. But let me say I don't think you'll be too disappointed. It makes me want to buy the whole series and start from the beginning again.

Some reviews are saying it is lame and others are saying that is is the ""best thing since sliced bread."" So you can imagine, but I am going to view it with an open mind and I am really looking forward to seeing what they did with their significanly higher budget. But at least we can be thankful that their are movies to follow to help wrap up specific hanging storylines. I also attended the Stargate Convention in LA recently and Cliff Simon (Ba'al) said that there are already two more movies planned after Arc of Truth and Continuum. Because apparently Continuum leaves a gap at the end?? So who knows if that will happen, right, but wouldn't it be brilliant to enjoy two more Stargate films??? (but the wait is a killer!!)",1204070400,3,852,4.467948717948718
3057840,2,B0010YSD7M,"As with many others, I had opportunity to view a screener of the video. It has some fairly impressive scenes in it and there was obvious extra budget beyond the normal episode. That said, as a movie, the video was fairly disappointing--it should have been cast as a four episode story arc minimum with extra details to fill in what turned out to be a fairly rushed, plot-obvious film.

The directors/writers crammed too much into the film. Expectations found on many sites for how the Ori story arc would end are spot on in almost every instance. The return of an old, previously defeated enemy in the middle of the film was creative but had little build up. This secondary plot, however, had greater depth and build up than the main plot.

The main plot, dealing with the end of the Ori, was resolved in a classic Deus ex Machina form--something I thought had been decried since the Greeks first developed it. Beyond just being classic, elements at the end of the main storyline echoed the end of Anubis in the tv series with only differing visual effects.

While much of the above is negative, it was a fun, if obvious story, with very impressive visual effects. The video clips of mountains were among my favorite and deserve a place in any documentary of the real earth location. The space battles were also visually impressive, as was the depiction of the ""Fields of Celestis"" and the incarnation of the remaining Ori.

 The overall story is completely rushed, you get the feeling that the producers where saying (We have 2 hours to wrap up the Ori story so Move it!)  Overal I have seen many SG1 season enders that where better than this movie so that pretty much sums it up the quality.
Ben Browder and Claudia once again just dominated the show with there prescence while once again giving lack luster performances that nobody will ever care about.

I hope everyone out there who is a Stargate fan will purchase this movie and leave reviews to show MGM and Sci-Fi that the Gates brand deserves another chance and ECW does not belong on the Sci-Fi channel.

It was horrible that the Sci-Fi network did not carry on this show; the ratings, the popularity, the fan base, even the show speaks for itself....10 YEARS.  Never has any other Sci-Fi series lasted that long.  Even the long running Star Trek sagas, all of them ran for their respective 7 seasons then came to an end.  And the stupid thing is, they canceled SG-1 when the story line was at a strong point with the battle with the Ori.

The Goa'uld story line alone lasted for 8 years, then the Ori became the next ultimate threat, A LOT more could have been done carry on the show.  Why didn't MGM just move the show to another network?  It first started on Showtime, then onto Sci-Fi; if Sci-Fi no longer wanted the burden (stupid decision I might add since their ratings would have carried one at a high point) then why didn't they just move on to another network?

3291453,1,B0010YSD7M,"I have never been more disappointed with this series since I started purchasing the DVD sets several years ago. My entire experience with this series has been through the DVD releases and while I have enjoyed most of the seasons, there have been more than their fair share of poorly produced episodes, yet I've stuck with the series.

Having purchased every set of the Stargate SG-1 series as well as Stargate Atlantis, I was amped up when I purchased this DVD, the final battle with the Ori and never, in my life, have I been so disappointed in this series than I have with Stargate: The Ark of Truth.

First off, MGM had overhyped this release to death giving fans of the series the impression that this was the end all battle with the Ori. After finally purchasing this DVD I was so severely disappointed with the movie that I felt robbed of the $18 I had spent on it.

Instead of getting a feature length movie of SG1's battle with the Ori, we're treated to an hour and ten minutes (1:10) of battle with the Replicators. The Ori are nowhere to be seen with the small exception of the opening of the movie as well as the ending of the movie during the final battle with Adria.

While I'm not dismissing the series at all, I would suggest that if you're thinking about buying this movie, don't. Save your money. Hopefully, the next project due out from MGM will save the series: Stargate: Continuum.",1199145600,10,1401,4.482352941176471

Like most loyal Stargate SG-1 fans, I firmly believe that this show could have continued, at least for one more season.  But MGM's greed and SCiFi's poor management  forced it off the air before its time (yes, I'm talking about you Bonnie...how you worked out in your head that ECW wrestling belongs on the SciFi Channel remains a huge mystery to everyone).

The series that spawned it has become one of my most beloved collections. The story line with the Ori and the fight against single-mindedly-determined fundamentalist analogs was thrilling to watch unfold.  My favorite part is the final confrontation between Adria and Morgan le Fay. Though it more or less rehashes a similar battle between Anubis and Oma de Sala, the scene is, even so, remarkable.

True, the movie rushes to a conclusion as it tries to tie everything together. Originally, this story was to have been the entire 11th season of the show, but other factors intervened.

3291477,4,B0010YSD7M,"This is the ending to the SG-1 series that you didn't get in the series finale. If you've watched all 10 seasons of SG-1 you really have to watch the Ark of Truth as it brings closure to the whole Ori story line, which was the essential driving plot of the final 2 seasons of the series.

It's basically just a 90 minute episode of SG-1 with a slightly higher production value. It flows well with the series. They don't do anything stupid like change actors, add major characters, or change the visual look of the show like you saw in Star Trek The Motion Picture, which only mildly resembled the original Star Trek.

They use the same sets, props, actors, etc as the TV show. It flows perfectly with it.  It's not the greatest ending of all time, but it's a good closure to the Ori story line.

However if you've only seen the original Stargate movie with Kurt Russel, you should NOT watch Ark of Truth. You will have no idea what's going on. This is not a movie you can watch without having see at least the final 2 seasons of Stargate SG-1.

But this wasn't a long episode to end the Ori story arc. This was the SG1 MOVIE.

It should have included more from the series, at large. Why didn't we get a chance to revisit the Nox in this movie? They were one of the original four great races, they could have helped in some way. There must have been some surviving Tollan, what about bringing one of them on? Somebody could have run into Maybourne. Where the hell was Jack? WHY DIDN'T HE NAIL CARTER IN THIS MOVIE? Even a random fallen system lord trying to regain some kind of power would have been a fun little throwback. Maybe a random baal clone still wandering around.

On the one hand, I get that the movie was a continuation of where the series left off. Fine.

I must say, however, the very last episode was so well done, so bittersweet an end, that it is kind of hard to top it, and Ark of Truth, while a great movie for SG-1 fans like yours truly, just doesn't match the quality of the last episode. I would've liked to have seen cameos from earlier episodes, and a little more creativity from the writers.

That said, it was still fun to watch, and great to have as part of my collection. The next time I decide to watch them all (which I never do at once) it will be there to bookend the whole experience.",1474502400,,674,4.184615384615385

I wish I could give it 3 1/2.

I really enjoy Stargate SG-1, and enjoy all of it, including this film. My only two issues...

1. The score is excessive. I get it. It's a movie. It's going to get a movie score. But after 10 seasons of the television show without one, you'd think they could have made an exception. It's always in the background. It's constant. It actually is distracting.

2. The replicator story arc is also extremely excessive. It's unnecessary. The story of the Ori was perfectly sufficient. The story arc with the replicators leads me to believe that the writers were unable to come up with enough on the Ori side to actually make a full length feature film. If that's the case, they shouldn't have made it. Not only does it feel cheap, but it feels poorly done.

Nonetheless... It's still a fun way to kill some time. And for SG-1 fans, still worth the watch.",1468195200,,906,4.5

So every year, SG-1 always wrapped up their main plotline... because they always figured they'd be canceled. And every year they were pleasantly surprised when they weren't canceled.

When they were finally actually canceled, they weren't expecting it. So they made two movies to tie up the plotlines that Season 11 would have wrapped up. Ark of Truth is the better of the two.",1456876800,,598,4.579439252336448

Ark of Truth as a series finale is fair. Not nearly the best adventure finale for the series by any stretch but it did have some great moments. Just don't pay too close attention to the details. Several characters are dropped in with little more than exposition for dialog. And many coda of the series are simply ignored in order to move the plot along. Also, there are a lot of drawn out scenes that just take up time and budget - an extended fight that involves Mitchell and a trek taken by Teal'c together eat up 10 minutes of this 90-minute film.

However as lazy as one of the major plot points is, it is a great twist and you don't see it coming. The overall suspense is just doom-y enough to carry you through to the end so it is worth it, but just barely.",1430611200,2,1048,4.178217821782178
3291616,5,B0010YSD7M,"Another great showing from the SG1 team.  The plot of the movie really wraps up the Ori story arc.  I was sad to see this series go, sadder when the third movie was scrapped.  If you are a fan of SG1 you have to watch this movie, its worth the rental price. Personally I will also be purchasing the movies (this one and Continuum) for my own collection.",1430352000,,353,4.161764705882353

3291717,1,B0010YSD7M,"This review is only for those (1) who have never seen stuff from the Stargate franchise and (2) Amazon recommends the movie to them.  This rating is based solely on these two factors

This film was ""recommend"" to me by Amazon, and since I generally enjoy good science fiction movie and it was free, I gave it a go.

First and foremost, it is not a standalone movie -- instead it is an end of series wrap-up made for TV movie.  It plops you down at the end of a large story arc and gives you no backstory to get you up to speed.  You get to follow around the characters through contrived subplots that ""magically"" all get resolved simultaneously at the end.  Furthermore, the character are not developed over the course of the movie and the plot continually references previous events outside the storyline.

Judging by the positive reviews, a fan who already invested with the characters and is in tune with the arc of the franchise will lap this up.  But for anyone who is not, this is not the movie to start with.

In other words, IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY A STARGATE FAN, AVOID THIS FILM. IGNORE AMAZON's RECOMMENDATION OF THE FILM TO YOU.  START WITH SOMETHING ELSE IN THE STARGATE SERIES.  Notwithstanding, if you are a Stargate fan, you might enjoy it.",1404777600,,1255,4.484581497797357

I'm feeling a bit sorry for the screenwriter - unless s/he came up with the concept for the story line - as this one was a complete waste of time. Fortunately, it was available on Prime. Therefore, only time was lost and I managed to take a short nap between the first 20 minutes and the last 10.

I don't know if the series was losing viewers and the ratings went down but I think it could have kept going for at least 2 more seasons. Just like Teal'c said at the end of this movie, there are a lot more planets that haven't been explored. There could have been all kinds of stories for the writers to do. They should have never made Stargate Universe series. It wasn't very good. They could have put that money and talent into 2 or 3 more seasons of Sg1. At least Sg1 had a great 10 yr run and in my opinion great movies also.",1398816000,,666,4.015037593984962

Production quality was D grade. Whomever did the special effects knew what they were doing, but whoever did the lighting (especially in the second act) was horrible. Some camera movements were unnecessarily shaky.
My general impression is that this was made to wrap up the story line of the series as quickly as possible to get it out of the way - on what looks like less than an episode budget.

I really like the Stargate series, been a fan since I first came across it, but this movie is the franchise's worst representation.",1396656000,,761,4.554744525547445

3291760,3,B0010YSD7M,"As a die hard fan of the Stargate franchise, I loved the opening scenes and credits of this movie...right up until the CGI took over. The villagers in the basement with the ark are discussing the morality of changing peoples' beliefs, even if those beliefs were false to begin with. Even though they could correct the cult's influence over the people, they couldn't do it without exercising the same mind control that the Ori cult did. But instead of casting exotic looking people, they hired mostly white Americans. The CGI of the ship leaving the snow-capped mountains ruined, in my opinion, the opening shots of the real mountains and the real snow.

Nevertheless, it's a good entertainment flick. And it ended up getting rid of, once and for all, the wicked Ori.

While not as rich and imaginative as many of the individual episodes, it was worth a watch.",1392336000,,859,4.758389261744966

Summary:

The film is the conclusion of Stargate SG-1's Ori arc, and picks up after the SG-1 series finale, but takes place before the fourth season of Stargate Atlantis.  SG-1 discovers a box that they believe contains the Ark while digging on Dakara, but before they can open it, Ori soldiers arrive, led by Tomin. Daniel tricks them into opening the box, but it is revealed to be a fake. When Tomin is ordered by a Prior to kill them, he refuses, and Mitchell kills the Prior, whose powers were being blocked by the Anti-Prior device. Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender.  When the Ark is activated and opened, the Doci is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers. With Adria now in a weakened state, Morgan is able to engage her in an eternal battle. SG-1 exposes the Prior on Earth to the Ark, transmitting the knowledge about the Ori to all of the Priors in the Milky Way, and thus turning all known Priors in the Universe.",1362096000,,1110,4.3478260869565215

This movie was enjoyable to watch, however I found some of the aspects of the story line somewhat cheesy. Bringing back the replicators might have been OK if it wasn't for the cheesy replicator-infected guy who seemed more like a bad ripoff of the Terminator than anything related to Stargate SG-1.

The central piece of this movie is the Ark of Truth, but we never are never led to understand it, and it is never really explained.

3291834,2,B0010YSD7M,"At some point, though always fuzzy, there needs to be a reasonable respect for physics and the rules laid down in the past- as well as common sense.  From Adria's zeroth hour revival (being twice completely vulnerable), 50 caliber machine guns relentlessly pounding away within our hero's spaceship without inflicting more devastating damage to the ship from within than the threat from without, Teal'c taking two staff blasts, defeating a host of jafa, pummeled relentlessly by his arch enemy and suddenly finding the strength to achieve a super human victory, Sam and Daniel solving impossible technical problems instantaneously and repeatedly when all hangs in the balance....it all defies this rule.  It always bothered me that they never addressed the infrastructure needed to maintain and build the technologies they were using.  In Arc of Truth, the plot descends into a pathetic string of melodrama that pained me to watch.  The last two seasons followed this recipe, sadly.  If they took the time to tell the story and let each encounter be solved in a 'reasonable' way through hard-won, incremental and reasonable experiences and adventures it would pass the test. But, sadly, the Arc of Truth left me with an A__ in Pain.

I can't help but retain my appreciation for the first 8 seasons and the wonderful characters and adventures to which I was treated.  I was happy to hang out with Teal'c and Daniel again and SG-1 will forever be one of my favorites.  I guess the team producing this just got tired of it.  In retrospect, the show should have been stopped at season 8.",1346803200,,1583,4.921052631578948

Cons: When first purchased this Blu-Ray in late 2008, I found there was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) lockout that prevented some players (including mine) from playing the disc even though everything was fully updated at the time.  Fast forward to 2012.... I decided to buy the Blu-Ray again, figuring 4 years is long enough for a new master to get into circulation.  No such luck.  I even bought a 2nd used copy hoping for a different batch.  Same problem.

To be specific, the Mastering error (or intentional) locks out Cyberlink PowerDVD 10, 11 and ArcSoft Total Media players, even if they are updated to patches dated 2012 which is well past this title's release date.  What you get is an annoying red ""update your player"" & "" we are not responsible..."" disclaimer screen. (See below). When you go to the URL on the screen, all it does is takes you to a general Blu-Ray advisory site which links the same updates you can get from the Player manufacturer's own web sites.  I had one tech support rep suggest I could try buying another player, but I think that's out of the question at $60 and up with no guarantee it would work.

The irony is I could watch this movie via a pristine Torrent download which was obviously copied from this same Blu-Ray and posted to the web.  In effect, the only people blocked here are the honest folk who have (as in my case) spent money 3 times to get a Blu-Ray that would actually play.

It's also disturbing that Lt. Col Mitchell gets the lead the command when Carter has been there the longest. Also, the writer chose to divide SG1 into 3 separate units during their off world crisis. Special effects are ok, but nothing more extrordinary than what we see on the tv show. This could have been a 2parter on SciFi Channel instead.

Mainly because I was getting tired of the Goa'uld plot, but I had no idea at the time that they were going to introduce a new villain, one that was even better: the Ori! Lucky this DVD has a 9-minute recap of previous events both on the special features and on the movie itself. You can choose between watching the movie with the recap or without. And it's a good thing too, at least for me, or I would have been totally lost. But thanks to the recap, I was able to enjoy the movie to its full potential. So even if you haven't been keeping up with the show, you can still enjoy it.

An epic action-packed film with a great plot. SG-1 is looking for an ancient artifact called the Ark of Truth that can help them defeat the Ori once and for all. But their mission will not be easy. Apart from facing danger from the Ori, they must also deal with a double-crossing I.O.A. operative on board the Odyssey as well as an army of lethal Replicators. But will their efforts be in vain? Even if they manage to find the Ark, will they find it in time to prevent the Ori from wiping out Earth's entire population?

3291848,2,B0010YSD7M,"I'm a fan of Stargate, and a HUGE fan of seasons 9 and 10.  Obviously I had high expectations for this, but unfortunately they weren't met at ALL.  The writing was just terrible.  I mean it would be okay for a decent action movie, but by Stargate standards it was garbage.

Everything was stilted, things (like the Ori, the Priors, the Orisi) that were scary as hell in the series were kind of boring and/or goofy seeming in this.  The wonderful chemistry between the cast felt completely absent.  Vala and Sam barely have a part-Sam's reduced to a handful of tech lines, Vala has to spew a few paragraphs of boring exposition (she's an amazing actor...but how do you strike the write tone for that character while reading...paragraphs of boring exposition?)  The only one who really gets a decent amount of screen time is Cam.

We have a generic, unbelievable bureaucrat, like they're saying ""hey, remember those awful bureaucrats we've seen on Stargate?  He's like them!""  We have a shift of loyalties that comes out of the blue, and doesn't seem to have any connection at all to how the character was ALWAYS portrayed.

Heck, even the 'dialing the gate' scene was done 1000x better at the end of ""Unending"".

I'm really not sure how to rate this.  I didn't hate it, but it's a huge disappointment, and doesn't do the series justice at all.  To the people who seem to have only watched this movie and are judging the series by that-start at the beginning, or at the beginning of season 9.

3291852,4,B0010YSD7M,"Longtime fan.  Loved the show.

Although ""The Ark of Truth"" was released in March 2008, I held off watching it until October 2009, primarily to savor what few unviewed SG-1 adventures were left to me.  It was a thrill being back with the SG-1 team as it engaged the Ori one last time.

The movie plays like a long episode of ""Stargate SG-1,"" with improved special effects and somewhat of a double storyline (i.e. two threats to SG-1, earth, the galaxy, et cetera).  The usual SG-1 team banter is present along with its typical locations of operation: Cheyenne Mountain, forests and space as well as various planets and Ori strongholds.

Villain #1 is obviously the Ori and its minions.  When Villain #2 appears, we get somewhat of a regurgitated storyline from a later SG-1 season.  It didn't particularly bother me, but I thought I'd point it out.  I won't reveal Villain #2's identity, but let you discover it for yourself.

Another issue is that SG-1 is--once again--reliant on acquiring and implementing Ancient technology (the Ark of Truth) in order to defeat the Ori.  This lends yet another god-from-the-machine-like aspect to the tale, where SG-1 must merely hustle about with lots of derring-do until it finally deploys the technology in a nick-of-time scenario.

On to the cast.  Michael Shanks looks somewhat chunkier, but not as much he does in season two of ""Burn Notice.""  Christopher Judge has grown even more hair.  Amanda Tapping, Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Gary Jones and Beau Bridges all look about the same.

Overall, an enjoyable adventure.  If more SG-1 is what you want, this shouldn't disappoint.",1256083200,,1621,4.944444444444445

I just couldn't get used to the Atlantis series and wish we saw more direct to DVD movies with the originals.

This one had more of the same aliens for the conclusion.  I'd like to see more in the way of the personal relationships the characters have after being part of the SG-1 program.  We didn't get to see a lot of what happened to Richard Dean Anderson's character, and It would have been nice to see how he copes with his new environment as General O'Neil.",1249603200,,743,4.24822695035461

The only episodes I didn't like were the 100th (Wormhole Extreme) and the 200th - and even these had a few good moments.  So when I say I was disappointed in ""The Ark of Truth,"" I say that as someone who greatly appreciates almost every aspect of this show.  I think I may have expected too much from this movie.  When the Ori story arc began, it not only breathed new life into the show, it created an expectation of almost non-stop excitement.  Each new Ori-related episode kept the excitement going and kept adding a little bit more, until I (like so many others, I'm sure) couldn't wait to see the resolution of the story arc.  That's why this was somewhat of a let-down.  It almost seemed in this move that they just wanted to get the Ori over with so they could move on to some other story line.  The final resolution had a very artificial feel to it.  I realize that the show's  weakness (other than it's forays into comedy, which never quite worked) was a tendency to rely too much on a ""Deus Ex Machina"" type of resolution; and that's exactly what happened here.  The resolution didn't proceed from or rise out of the struggles of the SG-1; it was just kind of tacked on at the end.  Don't get me wrong: it was still well worth buying and watching; and I guarantee you, if I had never seen any other Stargate SG-1 story, I'd be shouting its praises from the rooftops.

3291865,5,B0010YSD7M,"""The Ark of Truth"" is a good ending to the Ori story arc and the series (not counting ""Continuum""). Therefore, it's probably better for a fan of the series who has seen seasons 9 & 10. The movie itself is good; it plays a lot like an episode. I mostly like the extras too. Robert C. Cooper runs on a lot on the commentary. He even talks over Peter Woeste on more than one occasion. It may be just me, but I usually feel this way about his commentaries.

Well, it has this tv show feeling, you know, simple sets, simple special effects, overly simple plot and so on.

Besides, while watching I've realised how similar the technology became with the Star Trek series, the cloaking, beaming and the lightspeed thing.  I can understand the necessity but I felt like the concept of Stargate has, how can I put it, estranged so much from the original movie.

I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I'll watch it ever again.  I guess this title pleases the fans, so if you're not a fan, or never heard of the show, you will not lose anything by skipping this title.",1237852800,,766,4.352112676056338

3291876,4,B0010YSD7M,"The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- for one thing, the Ori were still threatening the world with conversion or death.

Fortunately that particular thread is decisively tied up in the direct-to-DVD movie that followed: ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" While it doesn't quite have the unique flavour of the TV series -- and the Ark seems like a rather pat quickie solution -- the movie does bring back all the favorite characters in a satisfactory ending.

""The Ark of Truth"" is an Ancient device that brainwashes people -- and SG-1 is searching for it, where they run into Vala's ex-hubby Tomin (who ends up teaming up with them). But soon they have a lead on where the Ark might be, and head for Celestis in the hopes of finding a bloodless method of stopping the Ori once and for all.

Unfortunately they have a slew of new problems -- Ori motherships are approaching Earth with the intent to convert or destroy, a nasty IOA rep has created and loosed a very familiar enemy on the Odyssey, and Vala's malevolent daughter Adria has gained godlike power. Fortunately SG-1 has a powerful ally of their own.

Since ""The Ark of Truth"" is basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as such they're not quite as satisfying as the television show was. Unfortunately it sometimes feels rather rushed and has a somewhat out-of-the-blue solution (hello magic fix-all!), as well as a subplot involving ANOTHER superpowerful villain race that seems likely but a bit misplaced.

But as half of the series finales, it's a solid piece of work -- lots of action, space battles, mysterious artifacts, and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. Fortunately that budget doesn't mean it jettisons the intriguing twists (Adria has an unexpected new position) or the moral dilemmas raised by the Ark (and the question of fighting evil faux gods vs. their followers).

It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, ""Star Trek"" homages, witty dialogue (""Well, you don't expect me to remember."" ""With the fate of two galaxies hanging in the balance, yes, I expect you to remember the essential clue!""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts.

And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder does a good strong, slightly quirky soldier. Christopher Judge gets to shine in  as a powerful, wise warrior, and Black gets to be both funny (""I have broken every nail"") and emotional.

While it's a bit rushed and contrived, ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" is a solid enough finale to the Ori storyline. Only half the ending to go.",1231718400,,2767,4.820675105485232
3291877,4,B0010YSD7M,"SG1 will never win major awards however it does deliver to its fan base which in the end is what it is all about.  In this particular installment the Ori (the guys with snakes in their chests have been wiped out if you haven't been keeping up) are regrouping for a major offensive and it is up to SG1 to take a stand against them.

3291879,4,B0010YSD7M,"I felt The Ark of Truth was a great finale to the Ori storyline, however the movie was too short and seemed like a long season finale rather than a motion picture caliber movie. The acting was top of the line Stargate SG-1 fare but I wasn't impressed with the use of replicators as a catalyst in the story. The ""Terminator"" also made it more cheesy because the replicators could have just made multiple Terminators without the need for human tissue. Why stay in a crab-like form all the time? It is in my humblest opinion that Continuum was a much more polished story, primarily because The Ark of Truth was a quick finish to the Ori storyline. For the Trekkies, the actual Ark of Truth was really an ""Adjust the Heisenburg"" matrix style solution to a problem. I highly recommend watching The Ark of Truth just so you get closure for SG-1 prior to Sci-Fi's cancellation of the series.",1229126400,,884,4.53125

 The movie started out a little slow, but soon ramped up into high gear as befitting this final episode. The effects, acting, and story line were top notch. To my surprise,they even brought back an earlier enemy that added an additional exciting element to the story.

I am a Stargate fan but this film was a disappointment.
I had expected the end battle between SG-1 versus the Ori instead the replicators were the main threat to SG-1. The previously powerful Ori ships looked very weak with 4 of them attacking and doing almost no damage.
A almost dead Teal'c after being shot in the back crosses a mountain range in super speed and finds the city of the Ori.
Then the final battle Adria who has all the power the Ori once had does not even get into the film until the end where she is tricked and we are supposed to believe most of her power just disappears for her fight against one ancient. Which is a copy of Threads.
Looks good but storyline was bad with the extra time should have been better thought out.",1222214400,,753,4.2727272727272725

There are plenty of things to like about the movie. Excellent visual effects, nice battle scenes with Ori followers, as well as a wink and a nod to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on occasion, make this a step above the average show episode. And yes, the Ori story arc is finally closed.

What's not to like? No big battle between the Ancients and the Ori, Carter suddenly becoming less efficient and a lot more girly, yet another over-the-top IOA guy, and last but not least the ""resurrection"" of a long defeated enemy. And oh yeah, no Jack O'Neill.

It took awhile for me to get used to the Ori plot and some new characters, but the show carried on just like it did before.  I was miffed when the show was cancelled right before the 200th (and arguably worst) episode aired.  When the end came, like other fans, I found the episode ""Unending"" to be lacking.  ""The Ark of Truth"" is intense and dramatic.  While it is the length of a full feature film, I thought it was more like a very long (and cool) episode of Stargate SG-1.  Even though the show has been cancelled, it still has the chance to live on in these movies.  I hope there are many more like it!

3291941,5,B0010YSD7M,"As a long time Stargate SG-1 fan who has come and gone throughout the ten-year run of the series, and had been watching quite regularly for the last couple of years, I was sad to hear that the show was finally coming to an end. When you grow so close to characters that you feel they are as much a part of your life as the real people in your life, the thought of losing these characters can really instill an impending sense of loss within you. And in some ways, I was feeling this very thing as the show neared its end.

And then I began hearing about the Stargate movies. While excited to see the films when they came out, I was also apprehensive, because the fatal flaw inherent in the act of anticipation is that such things can rarely live up to one's high expectations. But as it turns out, Stargate - The Ark of Truth far exceeded my expectations.

The film picks up and completes the Ori saga which had dominated the series for its last two seasons, and takes us into the Ori galaxy in search of The Ark of Truth, the only device capable of stripping the Ori of their powers by revealing the ""truth"" to their devout followers. The movie is classic Stargate, except it feels bigger, more grand in scale and scope. Even though it wasn't shown on a big screen, you get a bit of the cinematic experience when watching SG-1 travel to the Ori galaxy and doing battle on several different fronts, as always walking on the brink of disaster. While each of the characters get their just moments in the spotlight, Cam Mitchell (played excellently as always by Ben Browder) steals the show with some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a Stargate show. The movie is a fitting ending to the series as a whole, and also puts a nice cap to the Ori saga.

The DVD extras are also nice. My favorites were the behind the scenes special which runs about half an hour, and the footage of the Q &A session filmed at ComicCon. Getting to see Ben Browser, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge as themselves was quite fun. And for those not familiar with the series or the Ori storyline, there is a prelude which will catch you up on the storyline and lead you right into ""The Ark of Truth.""

So if you are a fan of Stargate, or of good adventurous Science Fiction, give ""Stargate - The Ark of Truth,"" a try!

I, too, was 'satisfied' by how this storyline was eventually completed. As usual, the special effects are top notch.

I hate to say that, because I loved watching the program when Richard Dean Anderson was starring. I have to say I only bought the 'Ark of Truth' because they left the Ori plot line dangling when the final season ended. To be honest, I felt cheated out of my money for this DVD. Granted, the producers had more money for creating a longer, more special effects laden product. Unfortunately they forgot the plot. I always had the impression that the Ori, this supposedly invincible foe, was going to end with a whimper. That is how it felt to me. Did we really need a plot line that had the Replicators involved one more time? How many times do you need to defeat them before they go away, permanently?

The 'ark' as a (completely) magic pill was beyond absurd and what leads to my two star rating.  Very good (but not cinematic) production values, acting, special effects, etc - but basically, this was a two-part TV show that should have been at least a half hour longer in order to provide some believable story line for the ark itself.  The cost for a two-TV-episode-equivalent DVD seems pretty high, given my disappointment in the plot.

See, the good thing about SG1 pre-Ori, was that all the characters had personality - even the bad old Goa'uld. When they introduced the Ori, all that ended. The Goa'uld you loved to hate. The Ori you could only hate.

Everything in this movie seemed rushed and disjointed. The ending was hokey. The movie was filled with scenes that were reminiscent of scenes from pre-Ori episodes.

I have to wonder why Christoper Judge was even in the movie. Did he speak two complete sentences in the entire movie, other than to try to make ""Tommy"" not feel so despairing over his past?

Vala's Ori daughter added almost nothing to the movie - her petulant pouting and posturing not withstanding.

We were glad to see, finally, an ancient actually take responsibility and bust the chops of the Ori.

The way the movie ended, they left it open for future SG1 movies. From what I've read of Continuum, though, there seems to be nothing original they can do to return to the glory days of SG1.

Suffice to say, this movie was a great wrap-up to end an amazing series. The only thing that would have been better was if the series was never cancelled and there could've have been an extra season or two of episodes to tidy things up.

The one drawback I found with the movie was how the movie seemed compressed in an effort to finish the Ori story in a clean manner. While the movie did a great job of tying up loose ends, it felt rushed compared to 10 seasons of episodes. It's just a shame that Richard Dean Anderson didn't at least make a cameo appearance (at least he'll be playing a big role in Stargate: Continuum<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Continuum/dp/B0017MO10U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate: Continuum</a>)

While I can understand that adressing all elements of the story arc with the Ori is next to impossible, I was most dissapointed with the final show down with Adria. Without giving away any spoilers for those who have not seen the film, I'll just say they solved the problem with her by using ""Magic Wizards""- A translation of this means that what was supposed to be a big, all out, triumph for the SG-1 and those who were plagued by Adria and her minions, ultimatly was not. I felt as if the writers wrote themselvs into a corner and when they could't get out of it, they brought in a supernatural force that was used minmally to toot the victory horn, hence, when you can't explain it well or don't know what to do, use Magic Wizards. They can end any story and get any hero out of a bind, magically. You know, it's sci- fi, anything can happen, right?

Add to it that the link between the scenes is weak at best. Even the scenes are poorly conceived. In one occasion a crew fires hundreds of round of military munitions aboard the spaceship without putting a single scratch to the ship.  In another one, 2 men move a rock-slab of a several tons by just pushing it. Not to mention Teal'c miraculous marathon, ran at a speed compared to a spaceship.

My only criticism would be that they should have stayed with the Ori story line instead of throwing replicators into the mix.  It seemed like too much was going on at once.  They could have saved replicators for another movie.  I would also have liked O'Neill to be in it, but he wasn't.

3291989,4,B0010YSD7M,"As many fans, I was upset with the lack of ability to finish off the Ori arc because of the series's cancellation. However, I think this movie fills the void. Old favorites and enemies arrive, and more background on the Ancient and Ori conflict.

The acting was done well enough that I actually liked Carter in the movie, which is a rarity. In fact, I used this movie for a school project because of the writing and how it related to religions. The only thing I would say I wasn't happy about was I felt like there was a missing time period between the ending of the series and the beginning of the movie. Perhaps a brief 30 second ""this is what we've done"" explanation would be been nice.

I loved that Claudia Black was able to show Vala in a different light, to allow the character to grow again. TI'm not going to spoil anything - what's the point in owning the movie if you know the plot? - but it's definitely a well-produced, well-executed, well-inspired movie. The writers didn't fall down on the job as they have during later seasons of the show.

Simply put: if you want to know what happens with the arc and have some fabulous behind the scenes extras, then I'd recommend the movie. I'm a stingy customer, I don't buy movies aren't 10 dollars or less, but I don't regret the movie purchase. That's a big deal for me.",1209513600,,1327,4.3861788617886175

Though some parts jumped from one scene to another with no explanation but it explains a lot of unanswered questions one had from the show. Especially why the ancients do not intervene, the truth about Merlin not ascending, but that it is Morgan LaFay whose been helping SG-1.  I am pleased that I finally got to hear how Teal'c battles in trying to do good after doing so much bad and how he feels.  The death of a Prior is also very intense.

Possibly it's to make the video more appealing to those unfamiliar with series as well. But this just my hunch. I'm not a movie expert.

I really was expecting more space battles. For a problem this big I thought they should have sent all three Daedalus class battlecruisers to the Ori Galaxy and have a big fight with some motherships; but no deal.

I kept getting the feeling that this was just a slightly stretched out epsiode, maybe what should have been the final episode of the series instead of the one where they are stuck on the ship.  If it had been the end of the series I might have raved about it, as it is though it just didn't have the punch that I wanted.  There wasn't enough drama and the action seemed very forced.  The action mostly revolved around a completely out of left field plot point that just left me scratching my head.  Its like they tried to make up more action so that all of the characters could have screen time, it was completely unnecessary and other more interesting action could have been thought up.  I apologise for being purposefully obtuse but I don't want to give away anything for people who haven't seen the movie yet.

The Ori were never very interesting bad guys to me, the whole destroy the heretics thing just left me yawning, because of that the last two seasons of Stargate SG1 were not as fullfilling as they could have been for me personally.  This movie was a last chance for the Ori to be an interesting baddie, and in that the movie failed.  At least this isn't truely the end.  Continuum sounds much more interesting, but then again I always though Baal was a very good bad guy.  The Ark of Truth was a good wrap up to the Ori saga but lets get some down and dirty SG1 action to send off the series properly.",1209081600,,1577,4.308474576271187

Taking place where the series ended and completing the 2 year fight with the Ori, The Ark of Truth is a grand conclusion to one of the best series ever made. It is a fast, thrilling feature length film that complements what has come before without making to too complex. Without giving away too many details, this finishes what season 9 -10 was building to and gives it a grand finale.  A wonderful bonus for new comers ... or those that have wandered away from the series in earlier seasons, it comes complete with a featurette, SG-1: The Road Taken, which catches anyone up for the orginal movie. I recommend everyone watch it before seeing Ark of Truth.  This movie is the best of SG-1, condensed into movie form, with loads of special effects the series couldn't afford.

I still remember recording a couple eposodes of Stargate SG1 off of the SciFI channel a few years after it first aired, and being absolutely mesmerized.

Since then, I've seen every eposode, some a few times.  Yes, I'm an addict.  Still, I didn't weep when the series ended.  I thought it had done a great job of exploring its reality.

But there were a lot of loose ends.  The Ark of Truth ties many of these off, and in doing so, creates much of the excitement that permeated the first season of the series.  Good writing, great cinematography, a tight plot, and a cast we all love.

OK, can we have another?",1208736000,,796,4.43448275862069

I could write for hours, but no one wants to read all that much. Let me just state that the sets were magnificent; the score was great; the explosions rocked; the private jokes that hearken back to snippits from the series made me laugh out loud; the plot was thick with layers of tension (because when does SG-1 get just one problem to overcome?)...

Even viewers who are intimately familiar with the Stargate SG-1 series lore will benefit from the quick-n-dirty ""review"" feature on the DVD. I recommend watching this, not just so you can see what a great job the editors did, but to give you the refresher before diving into the movie.

And when you dive in, hang onto your couch cushions. Make sure your glass is full and the pitcher of your favorite beverage is nearby because you're not going to want to even pause this thing to go get more. Once the movie started rolling, I couldn't tear myself away. The action starts and the storyline is already pulling you in. There's backstory to develop and it develops fast. There's no long, drawn-out explanation. No. It's ""dive in and then speed to present-day because we've got a movie with a ton of action to pack in."" And some fancy explosions. And some cool bad guys.

The special effects we've been spoiled with on the series were magnified. The dialogue and interaction among characters was dead on. I couldn't ask for more. Well...except maybe for more movies. When does the next one come out?

The only thing missing was Jack O'Neill, and then the movie would have been perfect.

That aside, the story pulls all the ORI threads together to a satisfying resolution.  The CGI effects are especially impressive.

I was a bit puzzled with the introduction of a second ""bad guy"" storyline, and would have liked to see more of the cool Asgard technology.

But, I've watched it two or three times now. You can tell the cast and crew have a wonderful time working together, and have built long-term relationships.

Because they have fun, we, the viewers, have as much (if not more) fun watching.",1208563200,,701,4.743801652892562
3292033,2,B0010YSD7M,"Don't set yourself up for disappointment.  Stargate SG-1's Ark of Truth is rather pedestrian.  The writer/director just didn't come up to par.

This doesn't mean that if you are a Stargate SG-1 fan that you shouldn't manfully suffer through it, if only to see Christopher Judge's Teal'c explain a personal Truth to Vala's Ori devotee husband.

When the first Star Trek movie came out, all of us fans went to see it. It was great fun seeing our favorite characters again -- Captain Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty -- even if the story plot was mostly derivative from earlier TV episodes and some was plain boring.  And then  there was the great new special effect of the Enterprise going into warp drive and the great new music.

But this movie doesn't even have the characters we came to love in the early Stargate SG-1 seasons.  Richard Dean Anderson's fabulous Colonel Jack O'Neill is replaced by a couple refugees from Farscape -- Ben Browder and Claudia Black, and Amanda Tapping's Captain (later Major) Carter is turned into a Kewpie doll.

Worst of all, Teal'c is called ""Muscles"" by Vala and not made to regret it.  Michael Shank's Daniel Jackson did reasonably okay; but it was an ego choice, not a good character realization choice to stop wearing the glasses.  I could have forgiven all this if only we'd had one cameo of General Jack O'Neill.

Forget special effects.  Also pedestrian.  Plus the director didn't seem to know how to make the transition from small to large screen.  Too often his choices for acting and camera angles and dramatic close ups are stilted TV screen fare, not smoothly inconspicuous as in a good movie.

BUT, without us supporting Star Trek: The Movie, there wouldn't have been Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was really great science fiction movie story writing and acting.  Nor would there have been Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which was such a lot of fun.

So, buy this anemic movie and pray that the next one redeems it, and that hopefully someone who understood the magic of the first 4 seasons (before the French bought the series and began ruining it) is brought in to do the writing and someone with some imagination and originality collaborates.

The producers/writers managed to preserve the classic Stargate feel while still making the show refreshing and entertaining.  There is an optional introduction for those who have not seen the 9th and 10th seasons, so if you're a little behind with the series you can still follow the movie (though I highly recommend watching the seasons if you haven't).

This movie could've been improved with about 30 more minutes added onto it. There were times when I felt like I was watching what could actually have been individual episode plots had the show been renewed for an 11th season, but have now been mashed together to make one big episode/movie. Also, because it was now a movie, it seemed like the director felt that the ante had to be upped, making the villains even badder, the situations even more dire, and the characters even more whumped. However, despite it's somewhat rushed feeling, I enjoyed all of it. It was nice to see Vala's old husband, Tomin, and know what finally hapened to him, and it felt good to see the team together again.

The Ark of Truth attempts to close the story in a satisfying way, but in my opinion, falls short. What has happened is, the entire planned 11th season was condensed into a 90-minute movie. And that's really what it feels like.

I will say that the movie benefits from a second viewing, and when viewed more as an episode of the series, it feels a little better. However, there were better action sequences in countless episodes than there are to be found in AoT. In places it just felt like it drug on a bit. In others, it felt rushed.

3292105,3,B0010YSD7M,"If the intent of this movie was to satisfy long term fans with a ""wrap-up"" of the final season, the producers/writers missed the target by a light year.  If you want a wrap-up of the season 10 story arc regarding the Ori, that's what you'll get.  However, that's about it.  I was vastly disappointed, finding the acting robotic, and the writing unimaginative at best.  Relationship issues were not addressed at all.  If you want to see what happened to Sam/Jack, or Daniel/Vala, don't waste your money - it's not even mentioned.  The whole plot felt rushed, as if the directors were trying to cram a hurriedly scripted ending into 1 hour of action - it can't and shouldn't be done.  Stargate was an amazing series, and had a great run.  I never thought I would say it, but maybe, just this time, they went one episode too far.",1207872000,,826,4.533783783783784

My major problem is that it does so WAY too quickly.  It takes what could have been up to a season's episodes worth of story lines and resolve them about the time of a two-parter.  The budget is clearly higher per minute of on-screen time than the weekly series.  But budget was never a weakness of the series.  ""Stargate SG-1"" was consistently great with what it had.

Other than being unsatisfied by the breakneck pace, ""The Ark of Truth"" is a useful, if temporary, fix for everyone who lost a major source of entertainment pleasure with the ending of the Stargate SG-1 series.

So, now I want my ""Continuum.""  More importantly, what about after that?  ""Atlantis"" is fine in its own right.  But nothing replaces ""SG-1.""",1207785600,,851,4.549668874172186

The Ark of Truth is like an extended episode of SG1 that wraps up the Ori storyline with a neat little bow. The production quality is higher than the already great job that was done on the series, with better effects and bigger and more sets. My only gripe is the lack of guest appearances by Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis (Jack and Gen. Hammond) but they're going to be in Stargate: Continuum, which is going to be the REAL end of the series. Overall, if you're a Stargate fan you need to see this so you know what happens with the Ori, but don't get your hopes up for a grand finale.",1207785600,,753,4.164383561643835

3292119,4,B0010YSD7M,"I really didn't expect much from this movie - from the previews it looked a bit like a Daniel love-in - but it was very entertaining.  Teal'c got more screen time than usual, which was a treat, and the movie hit a nice balance between wrapping up the loose ends of the series and keeping the team dynamic moving forward.  The music was just terrific and the effects great but not so big that they overshadowed the story.  My one nit-pick is that Sam didn't have as much of a role as I would have liked, but on the whole I think the balance was good - I love Vala and Cam and thought they were served well without neglecting the rest of the team.

Note to folks who aren't as familiar with the series - you'll DEFINITELY want to watch the introductory material so you can figure out what's going on.  It flows nicely into the main movie - a little better than a 'Previously On' but not too expository.",1207699200,,900,4.239766081871345

I thought the movie could have benefitted from being a little longer (2 hours or so instead of about an hour and a half), especially since we were left with such an open ending of the regular series.  There could have been some more historical scenes and some better explanations of things that needed to be wrapped up from the series.  However, overall I feel that the movie is a pretty good wrap up of the story.  It definitely had some great music (adding a symphony orchestra rather than synthesized music is almost always better in my book) and awesome visual effects (a bigger movie budget always helps not that the series had bad effects by any means).  Hopefully, future movies will wrap up a few more things as well as introducing some new ideas.",1207699200,,881,4.515723270440252

If you were even remotely interested in the television series and you are familiar with the storyline in the final season, this is a no-brainer must buy.

I would have rather seen the film for 120 to 150 minutes then see it so leap froggy.  Don't do it again to the next film!!!

3292171,4,B0010YSD7M,"When Stargate SG1 first appeared on the Showtime Pay network I was there with a bit of dread.  I know of many occations where a succcessful movie was bled for episodic television fare.  I was delighted in the differance from the Big Screen production and found it's quality writing and winning cast very addictive and enjoyable.  When after Ten years it was taken off Broadcast televison and going to Direct to DVD I was crossing my fingers that this trend would move forward to the new format.  After the first Made for DVD I must say it is a mixed bag.
  The story attemped to take alot of the concepts the producers were planning for the 11th season and it seems like they tried to jam them into a single feature length setting.  I think knowing the cast and the character development from the past ten years made a big diffeance for me to help  fill in the blanks that they had to race over to make it fit.  I am not sure if it will work the same magic for the newcommer.
  It had alot of things mixed together in a small box such as the Ori and the Replicators and the Giant Space Gate.  In the end the most evil cuts come from our earthbound evil element in the form of a misguied and compromized EOC agent who makes more of a mess then the Stargate team can handle...Well almost.
  The sound quality and picure is first rate and the special effects are a point above average from the televison series and the extras are reasonalbe and informative for both new viewers and the more experiance viewer.

I've been a fan of the series since the first season and mourned when Richard Dean Anderson left the show, but was intrigued (if a little confused) by the Ori arc.  I have to admit that I didn't see every episode the last few seasons, and the last dvd set I bought was season 8, but I was completely and utterly entertained by the movie.

Replacing Richard Dean Anderson, those are really hard shoes to follow and I think Ben Browder does a really good job. I love his humor and one liners in this movie, he pulled off the ""hero"" role well! Without ruining it for anyone, I can not go in to detail, but he isn't ""perfectly fine"" in the end, it goes with the story. (That should make you curious).

I think wrapping up the Ori, I am glad they were able to finsh the storyline, bringing back Aydria, Tomin and Morgan were great! The twist on the ship, interesting and definatly, ""Oh My Gosh"". Vilian with the IOA, I hated him, but that was the point!

Loved seeing a point of view from Tealc' that had not been seen before, that I remember anyway. His scene with Tomin was very powerful.

One liners were great, cast did an amazing job, as always! Can not give anything away, but there are still one or two loose ends character wise, I would like to see wrap up for the series.

I loved the movie since it brought to an end the season 10 story. Great special effects and story line. Too bad we didn't get to see Colonel Jack O'Neil again. It also opens the possibility to take the team in new adventures either to Atlantis or on its own.

The production value is high quality and makes it feel more like a movie than a two hour TV episode. The soundtrack is more orchestral, the locations are bigger and the special effects are better than the TV series. I also like how it left the ending wide open for more adventures.

3292214,1,B0010YSD7M,"Warning to anyone purchasing the movie, yet unfamiliar with the series. There is alot of back story to this. Best not seen before the series episodes.
  Love the SG-1 series (seasons 1-8). Not sure which writers were fired for 9&10 but they were certainly the best writers. Having suffered through two seasons of the Ori (a race Clearly capable of destroying Earth at any time, either directly or via proxies - yet unable to do so ...... because that would end the series), I was further disappointed with the movie.
  In 'The Arc of Truth' they now produce a mantage of all of the very worst plot devices used by the series.
  a) If you thought the Ascended Ancients were double-talking pacifists before, just wait until you see why they allowed uncounted billions to suffer under the Ori when their motivations are finally explained.
  b) If you didn't already have a gut-full of Shadow agencies launching suicidally ill concieved back-stabbing maneuvers. You'll love what the IOA pulls. (Makes the viewer take solice in the imminent destruction of Earth, if only because the IOA will finally be gone as well.)
  c) An old enemy (killed off twice now) comes back ...... again.

  d) Deus et Machina. Only the Arc can save us. That and noting else.... sound familiar?........ for the third time now?
  #1 Hunt for the lost city of the Ancients (was an origional plot at the time, and a good one.... then).
  #2 Hunt for Merlin's wonder thingy that destroys Ascended Beings (Two whole seasons of futile defensive measures turned around in one shot). Masochists rejoice!
  #3 The Arc of Truth. Find it or lose again (no matter what else you might do).

  They may wish to title the next movie ""SG-1: The Latest Scavenger Hunt""

  Or..... they can hire writers that do justice to the fine actors and special effects work. (Some basic math skills would be good too. ZPMs seem to be capable of destroying Star Systems in one episode and deplete themselves heating bath water the next in the Atlantis spin-off.)

  The actors, special effects and legacy of seasons 1-8 deserve better writing than this...... much better.",1207094400,10,2115,4.78393351800554

We (True Stargate SG-1 fans) were left Hanging when the show ended without a resolution to the Ori storyline. I enjoyed the movie, however I still felt that the resolution was rushed. There seemed like there was enough complications to handle to fill 2 DVD's. This has been my favorite Science Fiction show (take that Battlstar Galactica)! However, I must admit that the show lost it's way when RDA retired. I kept hoping that he would show up in the movie, for a last bow. Ben Browder & Claudia Black gave it a valient try, but the Chemistry between Cantanerous Jack O'Neil-Samantha Carter- Daniel Jackson & Teal'c could not be matched. This is the Only TV show that I am familier with that was better than the Original feature length film (which , I did enjoy). Enjoy the DVD.

The plot in this movie was actually intended to be the last three episodes of season ten and the first three episodes of season 11. Then the show got cancelled so they held off production and those watching the series never had a wrap-up. What does this mean for the viewer.

I agree completely with the review written by Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower"", so I won't repeat what the Captain said. I will add a little though. Since this was a made-for-DVD movie, one would have expected something more than what ended up being a 1hr 40min TV show without commercials. All the acting was terrific as usual, and the special affects were great, and the subtle humor moments were classic Stargate, but the plot was just gone. It was as if the writers handed over the job of writing the plot as a 9th-grade class assignment. As the Captain said, ""too simple""!

3292222,3,B0010YSD7M,"SPOILERS AHEAD....

Stargate has always had its homages to other genre shows and they are clearly on display here -- the opening caption paraphrasing ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"", the peak-to-peak aeral shot just beging for Gondor outposts to light the signal fires, a Terminator-like rise from an explosion, ... (I'm sure folks can spot more).

The visual effects were lovely, and there were some really good bits of characterization. The converation between Teal'c and Tomin was wonderful, as was Tomin's final scene with Vala.

As for the rest...
While many a Stargate villain comes direct from Central Casting, Marrick (the IOA guy) is particularly ill-written in a series that brought us Senator Kinsey, Colonel Maybourne, and even the briefly-referenced Mr. Woolsey. In prior episodes where the IOA, NID, or Senator Kinsey were challenging the SGC often they had a legitimate PoV, even if they were wrong. Here, they are just wrong and profoundly stupid.

Similarly, Adria mostly gets to chew scenery in her scenes with Vala rather than have some character development before her inevitable defeat. (Itself a solution borrowed from Oma Desala's final battle with Anubis.)

Others have commented on problems with the Replicator subplot and Repli-terminator -- one other aside -- what did they make the walls and BLUs (blinkie-light-units, per the commentaries) out of?! Thousands of high-power rounds blasted around them, and not one bit of damage? Yet they bend when Mitchell is tossed into them? Yes, limits of CGIs, but might have been nice to show some collateral damage on a movie-scale budget.

The wounded Teal'c walking montage eventually blew my suspension of disbelief -- particularly when it is apparently occuring at the same time as Carter and Mitchell's battle with the Replicators (who knew Teal'c could walk that fast!).",1206835200,20,1856,5.17

If you haven't seen any part of Season 9 or 10, you need to get those DVD's and THEN you need to see this.  It takes all the action and drama and heroism that made the show great, and takes it to a grander scale.  The orchestral score, the sweeping panoramas, and the harrowing fight to the finish make it a fitting conclusion to the show's biggest story arc.  The only thing marring it is the resurrection of a thrice-eradicated nemesis, but it lives up to the challenge of concluding the greatest sci-fi show since Star Trek.",1206748800,,610,4.278260869565218

I am sorry the series ended but glad they did the movie to tie up some loose ends.  Vala is wonderful as the new ""Smart-A"" replacing Jack's personality.

Actually, the best part of the whole DVD is to watch one of the features called Stargate at Comic-Con.  An interview in front of the public with Teal'c, Samantha and the producers.  Teal'c is hysterically funny, especially when he does his Randy Jackson impersonation from American Idol.  Samantha joins right in as Paula, and of course, a Simon comment.  After seeing Teal'c stiff as a board for so many years, I nearly died laughing.  He should be a comedian.  Teal'c calls Daniel on his cell phone.... hold on to your cheeks!

3292227,3,B0010YSD7M,"As a die hard SG1 fan,  I knew I was going to buy this movie  I know I am also going to buy Continium.

With that said, I think the movie was good,  but definitely not the best.  I think my main complaint is I miss Richard Dean Anderson.  I missed that wise cracking swash buckling role.  His just tell me where to shoot ""Carter"" personality helped balance the acadamic DR Jackson and Col Carter and his ""MacGyver ( for lack of better term )"" persona helped balance that muscle man named Telk.

I love Ben Bowder in Farscape,  but his character in SG1 is too much like a comic book super hero.

With that said,  I thought the story was good.  I felt the time the replicator story line took could have been better spent with the Odyssey battling the ORI fleet (arguably though we have seen enough of Odyssey/Daedalus space battles in SG1 and Atlantis).  The entire replicator story line was the movies main weakness.

I love Claudia Black.  Her character in SG1 is perfect for the show and makes up a ""little"" bit of what was missing from the Jack O'Neil character.

I was disappointed in not seeing much of Amanda Tapping.  Is her goal now to move behind the camera,  because you don't see her much in Atlantis also.

Overall this movie does a nice job wrapping up the ORI arc,  but despite its bigger budget and longer runs,  I felt that creators of SG1 did better jobs in previous episodes (Lost City 1 and 2, New Order 1 and 2 etc) with a lot less.

I hope RDA is back for the next movie !!!!",1206662400,2,1495,4.264285714285714

3292229,5,B0010YSD7M,First I would like to say that the production value of this movie is pretty high. If you loved the TV series you will love this DVD movie. Everyone (all of SG-1 heroes) have their parts perfectly played out in the usual style. My only disappointment is that Adria (played by Morena Baccarin) the main villain has very little screen time. I think out of the whole 102 minutes of the movie she has probably around less than 5 minutes of screen time. The plot is somewhat simplistic but it worked as the movie is on a time constraint and puts an inevitable closure to the chapters in the Ori storyline arc. Can't wait for Stargate: Continuum as it will be interesting how SG-1 will outwit and survive Ba'al's trickeries. One thing I have always wondered is what happened to the people of the various planets that were converted to Origin and now having their faith/beliefs literally yanked away from under their feet?,1206662400,,914,4.613496932515337

3292231,2,B0010YSD7M,"I looked forward to ""The Ark of Truth"", but, to be honest, it was a disappointment.  In my opinion, the only real purpose of the strangely disconnected replicator sub-plot was to pad the whole thing out to the length of a feature film.  Without the replicators, the whole thing could have fitted into a normal SG1 episode.  Heck - that's probably how it started out, before the TV series got canned.  They tried to jazz up the replicators with animated skeletons but I wasn't fooled.  Those replicators looked *tired*....  :-(

On the positive side, the main plot was more interesting, and I liked the new, hot-looking (big grin) Adria.  But I felt her final clash with Morgan le Fay was a bit inconclusive.",1206489600,4,707,4.691056910569106

3292234,5,B0010YSD7M,"""The Ark of Truth"" can best be described as Reckoning Parts 1&2 + Threads (both Season 8)= The Ark of Truth. Although not entirely original in its concept it is orignal in its twists. In ""Reckoning"" the Replicators all but destroy the Goauld System Lords and the humans destroy the Replicators, the IOA build on the idea that if the Replicators can destroy the Ori, just as they did the Goauld, then Earth can contain or destroy the replicators. Just as always, the IOA is wrong, the Replicators can not be controlled or contained for very long. Add this to ""Threads"", the concept that one Ancient can step in and battle another ascended being to stop them. Oma Desala battles Anubis, stopping him from reforming his armies - Nearly the same happens in this film, ending the Ori threat. I don't want to give away too much, but this movie is worth watching and adding to your collection, because in life, as in art, history DOES repeat itself, and in the Stargate Universe its always fun to watch it repeat.",1206403200,2,1006,4.594444444444444

3292238,3,B0010YSD7M,"Mostly because of the unceremonious ending and my decade old love affair with the show, I had high expectations for the film that would come to be called ""The Ark of Truth."" Maybe they were too high. It could also be that after 10+ years of watching 60-90 minute episodes that I became too familiar with the format and a full length film didn't fit the mold I'd created in my head.

Regardless, I was ultimately disappointed. I felt that even though the film was made for fans like me, it jumped into the story too quickly. It made the literary mistake of telling and instead of showing. The quick transitions in the storyline assumed that the watcher had the knowledge to fill in the blank and while we may have, it still made for a jumpy film that had a lot of holes in it.

I had hoped that given the time they had we would see the writers produce a very good script, but overall the writing was not a sharp as some of the better episodes of the show. It wasn't nearly as snappy and quick witted and lacked some of the subtle poignant statements made throughout the series. I was especially disappointed that the few Bondesque one liners we got from Mitchell were mostly mediocre. Also, as a longtime fan I'd hoped to see more inside references (see Episode 200) that the die-hard fans could truly appreciate, but that wouldn't lose the casual fan.

The reemergence of the replicators, I feel, prevented the conclusion of the Ori storyline from being as deep and smooth as it could have been. It smacked of the writers running out of material to put it, but I feel that had they taken more time to tell the story thoroughly, this would not have been a problem.

Ultimately, I was glad to have the chance to buy the DVD and show my support for the franchise and it was nice to have the series finally wrapped up, but I think they could have done a much better job. I gave it three stars above, but 2.5 would be more accurate.",1206403200,,1927,4.35933147632312

After watching it though, the movie actually seemed rushed, what I would have liked to have seen was this movie as the series finale on TV.

The whole Ori thing was beaten to death in the last two years of the show and the introduction of Vala(whatever her name is)over the last two seasons was a major disappointment for me, her character is boring and and out of place. Oh, and the replicators.. That is just old and tiresome, I actually lost interest in the movie when they introduced the replicators. And that whole fight scene at the end, that seemed to long and drawn out as well.

Having watched the show I was disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't make an appearance in the movie, his character was so well done through the years he was on the show that he really needed to be in this one as he is really a critical part of SG1 and what made those shows so good.

The Ori were (was?) a group of ascended beings who were trying to obtain dominion over everyone who wasn't ascended, and promoted this through a quasi-religion.  ""Priors"" would appear on unconverted worlds and advise everyone that they could accept ""Origin"" as  the basis for their lives, or face destruction.  They were really good at the destruction part, due to some nifty technology and a seemingly limitless supply of warships.

""The Ark of Truth"" concludes this story line.  Without creating spoilers, it's basically an extended SG-1 episode with some great location shots and a hair better visual effects than usual.  It also sets the stage for additional adventures, should the market support more Stargate SG-1 specials like this.

Extras on the DVD include some behind-the-scenes featurettes and a clip from a fan convention where the producers and several cast members answer questions in a panel format.

They do conclude the Ori plot. They do it in a typical SG1 style. A lot of people are griping about the Ark (the object itself) but finding ancient artifacts that do cool things (lets call it military archaeology) is what SG1 has been about from the beginning.

The trips through the Gate were funded with finding this kind of stuff as its primary directive (""find technologies to defend Earth"") and of course isn't this sort of thing exactly what the Gate itself is???

The movie deals in the series' motifs (I would have been disappointed if it had not and tried too hard to be something else): ancient artifacts, space travel, free will, good vs. evil, politics...

At first I was a little wary. I usually don't like straight-to-DVD movies. However, I was really surprised after a few minutes into it. I love the show, and continue to watch reruns whenever I get a chance.

This is basically one long episode of SG1 that they didn't get a chance to air. Think of it as Stargate SG-1 Season 11: The Movie. The actors didn't drop a beat when making this film. Great continuity.

Ark of Truth is what Peacekeeper Wars did for Farscape, only we didn't have to wait 4 years. Because of this fact, none of the actors aged greatly passed their characters (*cough*Chiana*cough*).

As far as plot goes, they couldn't have done it better. Even though many people would agree that after Richard Dean Anderson left the show, it was no longer SG1, Ben Browder and Claudia Black performed better than anyone joining a show after 10 very successful seasons. I can't consider them replacements. Their characters influenced the plot drastically, which makes them unique to the flow of the series. To me, they should have been in the show since day one, but they were busy in another galaxy in an alien ship doing Farscape.

Special effects were wonderful, but not throughout the whole film. In the beginning, especially, the sets looked like sets rather than other planets. That's okay though, because it wasn't distracting.

3292258,3,B0010YSD7M,"I've been a Stargate Fan since the first movie, and loyally throughout all 10 seasons over both cable networks it was carried on.  Stargate: Ark of Truth is a fun ride, a step up from the weekly show, but a disappointment in complete lack of story originality.

In this story, (AN EXACT CLONE OF THE REPLICATOR DEFEAT EPISODE IN SEASON 9) SG-1 discovers yet another ancient artifact that will destroy the nearly un-beatable near-omnipotent foe.  Exactly as they defeated the replicators with Bal's help in season nine, with a convenient 'link' between all Stargates and this Ancient weapon, the Replicators were wiped out in a single stroke, all over the galaxy with a coded entry on an old stone control pad.

Guess what happens at the end of this movie?  Well, without revealing everything, a convenient 'link' to all the ((blanks)) from an old stone/metal tablet Ark, wipes out all ORI believer's faith in one stroke once the critical coded pattern is stuck on the device.  ORI defeated, as quickly and as unbelievably neatly as the replicators were way back when.

Even more lackluster, the ORI ""were killed"" and not just wounded by the device sent to kill them in the latter part of Season 10 where Daniel Jackson was a Prior deceiving old evil Audra.  So, no better complexity of the Ancients versus the ORI, and how humanity can step in and fight is ever really explored.  We'll just leave Jackson a new ancient buried wonder-device to take care of it in the end.  With all of these perfect weapons laying around the universe in piles of desert dust, how in the world did the Wraith ever cause the ancients a sweat?  The ancients could not have found all of this stuff when they needed it?  Puhleeze!

Audra does little more than dance around in fiery steps, brag on about having all of the power, and wastes what could have been a nice scary scene with Claudia Black.  Julian Sands has a cup of coffee as the head prior, and then does nothing.  I was hoping for a bit more battle with the heavyweights!

The movie is fun, tosses in the predictable IOA manic official with poor judgment and an even poorer dialogue, but a terminator replicator he becomes, and of course Ben Browder will survive about 15 steel pounding hits without dying or being rendered inert.  The logic behind the IOA  guy's story for intentionally risking everyone's lives is silly, not even political paranoids could or would get away with his access and security passes.

We get some more astounding Canadian scenery, which is okay, the special effects are good, and the humor and dramatic elements are nicely brief and poignant for a change, so the movie moves well if the story lacks for any originality.  Oh my, IRONY, with ORI and ORIGIN, you get NO ORIGINALITY.  That point sticks with me badly I'm afraid.

The cast is sharp, but sadly, there is no pickup of Jackson's and Vala's destined romance, only Beau Bridges gets to deliver what is expected, and Tealc' is in good form.

I was shocked that I really did enjoy the show, about 2 hours 10 minutes of no boredom, but later as I rummaged the tale through my head, remembering it was little fun, so much potential missed, and a story completely cloned in the conflicting elements exactly to the old formula of beating the replicators, a similar track was used in older SG-1 episodes too.  Let's hope Stargate Atlantis does not suffer from such story redundancy and writer's laziness.  This copy-cat story transfer was a true shame, hope this writer did NOT GET PAID!  Adding in Replicators is a transparent attempt to boost cheap excitment levels and raise kids hands cheering, but leaves any mature Sci-Fi senses flat on the deck of the Odyssey swimming in that replicator shrapnel.

Most of us could have written a far better screenplay.  This was not bad at all, it is fun SG-1 show, worth the time, but the end-all story to a huge build-up from the past 3 seasons, had no merit, honor or punch in the end.  Its a feel-good send-off to all SG-1 fans, but only if you're VERY generous on forgetting that they've done this to you time and time again.

The actors and the show deserved a better ending to the ORI storyline!

3292259,5,B0010YSD7M,I loved it!  Beautiful cinematography and some impressive special effects.  I hope they do a few more movies!  I enjoyed the *extras* on the DVD as well.,1205798400,,153,4.592592592592593
3292260,5,B0010YSD7M,This is really one of the best sci-fi movies and series based movies I have seen in a long time. The production quality is great and it shows what the producers of Stargate SG-1 can do when they are not subject to a low budget. I think is the best way for the SG1 saga to graduate to the 2 hour format. I can't wait for the release of Continuum and the return of Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson). If you are like me and already own the complete DVD collection then this is the best way to top it off.,1205798400,,504,4.0
3292261,5,B0010YSD7M,"I just got to watch this for the first time tonight, and I must say that I am very impressed. Being a longtime Stargate fan (right back to the original film), I was hoping that this sequel film would stick closely to the series... and it did very nicely.

I found the cinematography to be excellent, with a large number of panoramic special effect sequences that were a nice upgrade from the already-terrific standard set by the show. Joel Goldsmith's score for the film was absolutely fantastic, too. I'm hoping it will be released on CD soon.

I was also glad to find that the film did not go ""over the top"" and remained about as family-friendly as the TV series did through the years. I'm already looking forward to the next one!",1205712000,,732,4.496240601503759
3292262,4,B0010YSD7M,"I'm going to open with a politically charged statement but bear with me since I'm trying to make a sense.  BABYLON 5 and STARGATE SG-1 both have some pretty fanatical fans.  As a television series, I think BABYLON 5 was much the better of the two.  It took greater risks in its storytelling and did more to develop the possibilities of television SF.  On nearly every level, B5 was the more substantial show.  Nonetheless, most of the B5 movies simply were not very good.  STARGATE SG1: THE ARK OF TRUTH is, on the other hand, very good indeed.

Of course, one reason the movie is so good was because a number of important plot threads were left unresolved.  Gestures had been made toward the resolution of the Ori story, but it certainly hadn't been completed.  And I loved the fact that the series finale was devoted not to plot resolution but to spending time with the main cast members.  It was a very satisfying, relatively unambitious series finale.  But since the main appeal of the show had always been the main group of characters, it was completely appropriate.  ARK OF TRUTH managed to very satisfyingly wrap up the Ori story.

I suppose any individual might find reason to complain about one or other aspect of the film.  I always enjoy more rather than less Daniel Jackson, but here he didn't get as much of a hand in the story as usual.  I also really love a lot of Vala, especially when wearing nice midriffs, but as Claudia Black was pregnant during the filming of the film that wouldn't work.  I'm not sure precisely how pregnant she was, but let's just say she got to wear a lot of body armor in this one.

We not only got a resolution to the Ori arc, but we got to revisit our friends the Replicators.  Always got to love the Replicators.

This movie historically could prove to be of considerable importance, for good or ill.  Studios have been struggling with the whole idea of direct to DVD movies.  They are aware that there are several shows that have a cadre of extremely dedicated fans.  The question so far has been how to take advantage for the studio of this core group of fans in a way that satisfies the fans and makes business sense for the studios.  The main show in this regard has been FIREFLY.  Although cancelled after only 11 episodes were broadcast (though others were made), the series became one of the steadiest selling series in the history of television.  But here is where the story gets complex.  Turning FIREFLY into the movie SERENITY proved a box office disaster, with the movie failing to make back its costs.  But then once again the story gets complex.  SERENITY became a significant profit maker due to its DVD sales, to the point where a new and expanded DVD was released, which continues to sell well.  Now Universal is contemplating a second SERENITY movie.  But here is the dilemma.  Do they make another regular theater release film?  Or do they just go direct to DVD?

This is why STARGATE -- THE ARK OF TRUTH is so important.  If its sales are good and make a profit for the studio (also, there is a second STARGATE coming out this summer), then it could encourage other studios to take a risk with direct to DVD movies.  If both the STARGATE movies make money, then we might not only see SERENITY 2 (different studio, but this is something the industry is watching) but other beloved shows continue through direct to DVD productions.

So keep your fingers crossed!  Better yet, go buy a copy of the movie.  If this movie does well, we all stand to benefit not merely by additional STARGATE films, but other films and shows as well.",1205712000,4,3592,4.537383177570093

3292265,4,B0010YSD7M,"For those of us fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-1/dp/B000TJBNHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-1</a>&nbsp;on the Sci Fi Channel, August 21, 2006, was a very depressing day.  Production had already passed the midway point of its 10th season, making it the most enduring science-fiction TV series in U.S. history after Chris Carter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000UZDO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>, which lasted nine seasons from 1993-2002 on Fox TV.  (I was just as equally a fan of that one, too, and I look forward to the upcoming second feature film.)  That was the day that Sci Fi pulled the plug on our venerable ""SG-1"" as of the conclusion of season 10 in the spring of 2007.  ""SG-1"" ran from 1997-2007:  five seasons on pay-cable network Showtime and five seasons on the basic-cable network Sci Fi Channel.  Ten seasons on television is a venerable legacy no matter the genre, but to survive that long in science fiction is downright remarkable.

Despite the cancellation, however, there was a ray of sunshine.  MGM (the production company) was eager to continue their very profitable franchise, as was executive producer Robert C. Cooper.  (Spinoff series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis/dp/B000XEB160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis</a>&nbsp;recently completed season 4 on Sci Fi Channel [as of this review date] and will return with the first half [10 of 20 episodes] of season 5 in July 2008).

Thus came the announcement that ""SG-1"" would continue with at least two DVD movies, the first of which is this film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-The-Ark-of-Truth/dp/B0010YSD7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate:  The Ark of Truth</a>.  Filming occurred in their usual Vancouver, BC, soundstages as well as on location in the frigid Arctic in the early spring of 2007, and was immediately followed by the filming of STARGATE:  CONTINUUM, which will be released on DVD in July 2008.  The second DVD film will reportedly involve time travel and will feature the return of original ""SG-1"" series star Richard Dean Anderson as Col. Jack O'Neill.  MGM and Cooper are hopeful that continued interest in ""SG-1"" will fuel the fire for more DVD films with the ""SG-1"" casts (present and/or past).

For those unfamiliar with the ""Stargate"" universe, the Stargate teams are a super-secret branch of the U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with participants from other nations, operating beneath the NORAD complex located at the Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado.  The real entrance to the complex is used for exterior shots.  The public at large, of course, has been prevented from learning that humans from Earth have contacted aliens from other planets.  The Stargate itself is a circular portal through which humans are able to walk through and almost instantaneously, via a form of wormhole, be transported to planets in other star systems.  The Stargate is powered by alien technology, and the discovery of the Stargate and contact with aliens explained why earlier human civilizations believed in many of the gods with whom we are familiar in popular mythology today.

If you've never seen ""SG-1,"" you might be a bit confused by the complex mythology of ""Stargate,"" which really began with the 1994 feature film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate/dp/B0000844I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate</a>, starring Kurt Russell as Col. Jack O'Neill (later played by the aforementioned Anderson, who left the show as a regular after the eighth season to be closer to his family in L.A.) and a pre-""Boston Legal"" James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson (played throughout the series [with the exception of one season due to salary and the omnipresent ""creative"" issues] and also in this film by Vancouver native Michael Shanks).  Plotwise, the TV series' 1997 debut picked up one year after the feature film ended.

Suffice it to say, if you don't know the show, that it would be a good idea to think back to 1986's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-IV-The-Voyage-Home/dp/B000089QC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a>.  It was arguably the most popular of the 10 feature films (which will become 11 films in December 2008 with J.J. Abrams' prequel to the original 1966-69 TV series, where we find the young Kirk/Spock/McCoy triumvirate at Star Fleet Academy) because it was a basic, stand-alone story about saving two humpback whales whose survival literally also meant Earth's survival.  One needn't be a ""Star Trek"" fan to enjoy the so-called ""whale movie.""

In this film, the basic plot involves a threat to Earth by the evil race known as the Ori (""OR-eye""), who march across the galaxy and force entire planetary populations to submit to the Ori's bible, known as the Book of Origin (from which their name ""Ori"" is derived).  The Ori have the power to overcome virtually all that oppose them, and their retribution is swift and deadly.  The Ori are able to maintain their reigns of terror with the help of local representatives known as priors, to whom they are supremely dedicated and whom the Ori are able to totally control; or, resistance results in brutal retribution, with death and destruction in the Ori's wake.  Naturally, it's up to the SG-1 team to find the Ark of Truth, which holds the only known answer to eradicating the Ori before they reach Earth and fulfill their ultimate victory.  In a nutshell, it's your classic good vs. evil story, and it's a good one.

It's also the proper conclusion to the Ori storyline, which basically consumed the bulk of the ninth and tenth seasons' storylines.  Because the cancellation notice came while the writers and producers were more than half-way into the final season, the series finale left fans (like me) feeling ultimately unsatisfied.  This DVD film basically wraps up that storyline.

I promise that if you haven't seen the series, picking up the DVD will not make you feel like you've walked into a movie theater halfway into the film.  Like the ""Star Trek"" whale movie, it's a stand-alone DVD that you can easily follow.  You are just as easily able to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  Also, there's a wise addition of a ""catch-up"" sequence that provides clips from the series that refreshes viewers' minds of how we got to where we are, since the last new ""SG-1"" episode aired almost exactly one year prior to the release date of this DVD.

All of the cast members from seasons 9 and 10 are here:  Ben Browder (who is currently 45 as of the date of this review; Ben was raised in Charlotte, NC) as Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell (effectively Anderson's replacement); Amanda Tapping (42, from Toronto) as Lt. Col. Samantha Carter; Christopher Judge (43, from Los Angeles) as Teal'c; the aforementioned Shanks (37, from Vancouver) as Jackson; the seasoned veteran and always enjoyable Beau Bridges as Maj. Gen. Hank Landry (66, from Los Angeles, who replaced Don S. Davis, whose character, Maj. Gen. George Hammond, was ""promoted"" and shipped off to Washington, DC, at the end of season 7); and Claudia Black (35, from Sydney, Australia) as Vala Mal Doran.

The core cast is superb as usual.  Black can always be relied upon for comic relief, especially when Vala is frustratingly torturing the patience of Shanks' Jackson.  Those of us who were addicts of the late and supremely, fantastically great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape/dp/B0002VGSBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape</a>&nbsp;(1999-2003) still can't help but remember the chemistry that existed between Browder and Black, not Shanks and Black.  To placate some of the fans' very vocal ire at its cancellation, Sci Fi commissioned a two-night, four-hour miniseries in 2004,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Peacekeeper-Wars/dp/B0006FO9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars</a>, as a wrap-up.  The cost of producing the series in Australia, coupled with a drop in ratings in the fourth season, were the reasons given for the show's cancellation, but for its very dedicated fans, Sci Fi's excuses still ring as hollow today as they did then.

The cast and writers tip their caps to a couple of other sci-fi franchises, as you might recognize one character as ""Ah-nold"" in a certain, um, poor state of existence; and then Lt. Col. Mitchell takes the helm of the Odyssey to fight the Ori and mangles the order to get underway to the point that would probably make Capt. Jean-Luc Picard absolutely blanch, pull his shirt down stiffly, turn and walk into his ready room, and bark ""Earl Grey - Hot!"" at the replicator.  Seriously, they're both nice touches and honor other sci-fi classics that have gone before.

Prolific character actor Currie Graham (""NYPD Blue,"" ""Suddenly Susan""), who hails from Hamilton, Ontario, does his usual fine job playing the nasty guy with an ulterior motive.  This time his James Marrick is an agent from the secretive black-ops organization IOA.  He arrives under the premise of interrogating the captured ""enemy combatant"" Tomin (Tim Guinee).  The real purpose for his presence soon presents itself, however, and he puts everyone in peril.

Reprising her role of Adria is the simply stunning Morena Baccarin, who fans of Joss Whedon's work will remember as ""companion"" Inara Serra in the woefully underappreciated 2002-03 Fox TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>&nbsp;and its excellent 2005 followup feature film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B000Q9IZ5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>.  Adria, the daughter of Vala, has been genetically altered by the Ori to grow from a normal baby into an adult incredibly rapidly in order to serve as their epitome (and far beyond that) of the term ""demon child.""  The special effects used with Baccarin are quite impressive.

And also reprising his role as the commanding and all-fearing Ori leader Doci is one of my very favorite actors, Britain's Julian Sands, who is barely recognizable under his ghostly and unnerving makeup.  With his cape, collar, and staff, he makes for an imposing and fearsome foe.

The film, at 1:42, came across to me as what would have been a two-episode season-ending cliffhanger and season-premiere resolution, had they aired on Sci Fi.  In one of the bonus features, Cooper mentions that this film pretty much was written as such, since he didn't have the time to wrap up the plotlines because of the fairly late cancellation notice.  It wrapped up the Ori storyline, but that's pretty much all.  To that end, I wasn't exactly blown away.  Still, there was much to admire.

Having admittedly acrophobic Chris Judge (as you'll learn in a bonus feature) dropped onto a knife-edge snow-capped mountain peak in the Arctic and have him, as Teal'c after being injured by an Ori weapon, trek along toward a destination he is determined to reach, is gut-wrenching, nerve-racking, beautifully executed, and exquisitely shot.  (That's one difference between the budget of an hourly TV episode and a [perhaps modest] feature-length DVD film.)  The Arctic landscapes are, to quote a heroic moonwalker some three decades ago, magnificent desolation.  Judge's performance in this film reveals the ever-growing quiet dignity that he has given Teal'c in the last 12 years, counting his recent ""Atlantis"" appearance.  Watching him struggle--injured, exhausted, in excruciating pain--to walk just one more step, and another, along a low-tide beach toward a holy city almost makes you feel his struggle come right through the TV.  His performance is exceptional.

Ultimately, I enjoyed this film and am happy that the Ori storyline is resolved.  How it is done so, you must see for yourself.  It's a thrilling and enjoyable conclusion.  Season 10 on Sci Fi did not accomplish this, but STARGATE:  THE ARK OF TRUTH does, and satisfyingly so.  And the bonus segment with most of the core cast at ComicCon in San Diego, hosted by one of my favorite but underutilized supporting cast members--Gary Jones (Chief Master Sgt. Walter Harriman, best known for a few lines  such as ""I can't get chevron seven to engage!"" and ""Unscheduled off-world activation!"")--is absolutely hysterical.  If Gary doesn't do stand-up, maybe he should consider it, now that he has, er, some ""free time"" on his hands.  (I have seen him in a few guest-starring roles recently, though.)  The bonuses aren't numerous, but those that are provided are made to count.

So sit back and enjoy, and don't forget!  In four months comes ""STARGATE:  CONTINUUM"" and ""RDA"" is back as Jack O'Neill!  Now THAT'S something to really get excited about!  :-)

DVD REVIEW:  **** (out of 5) -- 17 Mar 08 (Happy St. Patrick's Day, all!) -- BOB BOURBEAU",1205712000,9,13233,5.552566018933732
3292266,5,B0010YSD7M,"Please buy this DVD so they will make more SG-1 movies.  I would buy it again despite what I'm about to say.  The movie had its moments, and was visually stunning, but I couldn't get past the fact that they wrapped up 90 minutes of building story in less than 5 minutes, left major questions unanswered, and just got plain silly at the very end.  I miss this show very much, and honestly just about anything is better than nothing, so even though I was pretty disappointed overall this is the only place you'll hear me say it.",1205712000,,526,4.346938775510204
3292267,3,B0010YSD7M,"Sure, it was great to see the characters, more like old friends now,  that I've missed since Stargate SG-1 ended, but this long awaited TV movie felt more like two average episodes than anything like I hoped it would be.

I thought something was strange when the opening credits were white letters over white snow in the mountains.  Some very hard to even read. How did that get past someone?  Just a nit, but it made me wonder what I was in for.  Caution, spoilers follow.

First, I was disappointed that the story revolved around a magic weapon that solves all our problems if we can only find it, which of course we know we will eventually.  That made the whole adventure more or less predictable.

What follows is a lot of lets say very conveniently written stuff with some strange transitions.  We've got the Odyssey going through the Super Stargate in one scene and immediately Vala and Daniel are sitting at a table in a villiage in Ori occupied space.  That was easy.

Then here come the replicators, again.  Replicators have already been done in the SG-1 series, where they were an original idea to the series, and in Atlantis, where it made me think the Atlantis writers had run out of ideas, and now here they are again!  Once again we are treated to scene after scene of heavy and light machine guns mowing down replicators while the bullets do absolutely no damage to anything that isn't a replicator.  It got corny a while ago, folks.  By the way, why did the characters weld and bolt the doors to the Asgard Core room shut if it had already been established in the show that the little bugs can just melt their way through metal?

Then there's the new twist: the gross zombie replicator human, and the endless fight between this thing and Mitchell, which ends with the terminator (er..oops..replicators) forming a human skeleton after all the flesh has been burned away.

Why is it that all of a sudden these Ori mother ships aren't so tough, and four of them can pound away at the Odyssey for endless minutes while the replicator problem is taken care of, and then once the replicators are defeated the Ori ships all of a sudden become an urgent threat again?

How can Teal'c get a Ori weapon blast in the back, get left for dead, and in the morning feel great enough to go mountain climbing, complete with incredibly corny not-too-Stargate-like melodramatic music playing?  He falls flat on his face but gets supernatural help to recover.  Later, he somehow penetrates the Ori city and shows up in a Pryor's uniform to rescue our heros, but we never get to see how he did it!

One thing I forgot to mention at first, Samantha Carter seems to come across more like a soccer mom than a military person.  Maybe because her hair seemed long for a military person, or because she baked cookies for Mitchell and kissed him on the cheek while she had her hair completely down while on base at the end of the episode.  I don't know, but something seemed tweaked about Sam.  Of course, I'm not caught up on season four of Atlantis.

Finally, the super villian in this story is dispatched just the way the super villian Anubis is dispatched in the Threads episode.

Anyway, I thought will all the extra time available to make this movie I'd get to see something fresh and somewhat original, but it was the same old same old.  At least the Ori story arc was brought to a close.

Bottom line: see if you can see it without paying full retail.",1205625600,12,3447,4.525040387722132
3292268,4,B0010YSD7M,"I am a huge fan of Stargate SG-1, and own all 10 seasons on DVD.  I greatly appreciate that the Ori storyline was wrapped up in this movie, since there were a lot of dangling threads at the end of season 10.

Among the things I enjoyed:
- all of the actors did a great job, as usual, and there was excellent continuity with the series mythology (case in point, the Asgard core that was obtained in the final aired episode)
- excellent production values, especially entering the Supergate and Adria's flaming powers (though the series always did a great job of making every dollar count in special effects)
- the very best lines given to Christopher Judge in 10 years as Teal'c and Tomin discussed guilt and redemption
- the moving scene where Daniel breaks down, at the limit of his faith and endurance

Things I did not enjoy so much:
- the one-dimensional IOA bad guy
- some very big scene jumps that had me confused for a while (ie, after entering the Supergate, suddenly Vala, Daniel and Tomin are undercover on an Ori world meeting with the underground)
- bringing the replicators back was repetitive, and isolated Carter and Mitchell from the Ori saga
- the replicator-zombie was just gross, and not particulary original

After listening to the writer/producer/director's commentary, I wish he had spent less attention on production values and more on increasing the emotional resonance of the story.  The fact is, most fans have followed SG-1 so loyally because they love the characters, and would like to see their reactions and interactions with each other.  This story felt detached somehow -- I have felt much more invested in the characters in some of the season finales than in this movie, and the season finales were never short of action, so I was suprised that the writing didn't seem up to the same standard.  Without that emotional connection, the battle and even the victory seemed a bit hollow to me.

That said, it was wonderful to revisit with my favourite TV show again, and I hope they make more DVD movies!",1205625600,2,2031,4.701408450704226

Liked the extended 2 hour format and I am hoping if the sales go well, then maybe the movies will continue.  Also, the bonus features on the disk were great as well.  From the making of the movie, to the comic con interviews in San Diego CA.  I agree with Ben Browder, that one fan can't carry a tune in a bucket.

3292270,2,B0010YSD7M,"After a year of waiting, a very disappointing 90-minute episode entitled ARK OF TRUTH is released with a $20 price tag.

I had expected the entire story to be devoted to the end of the Ori, but you will find only half the movie covering their final demise.  The other half resurrects an old villian from Stargate's past.  So what we end up with is a quick conclusion to the Ori storyline which ends exactly the same way as the Anubus storyline ended.  The rest of the movie has battle scenes we've seen before in many past episodes as they fight the old villian from their past.  And we also get a fight scene with Cameron against an unbeatable foe very similar to the Black Knight he fought in the Camelot episode.  Rent it before buying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1205625600,4,752,4.492647058823529
3292271,5,B0010YSD7M,"All I can say is, ""Wow!""  This film was a lot of fun and while the ending was just a little contrived it did what was intended: tied up the Ori storyline so the team can move on to other adventures.  First, let me say that I'm not one of those people who thinks the Sci Fi Channel was doing the bidding of Satan by cancelling Stargate SG-1.  It was time, in my opinion, for the long-running series to leave the air.  The Ori storyline, which I never liked, was dragging on forever and it seemed the writers of the series were just rehashing old sci-fi plot devices to fill out a full season.  Second, this film goes a long way to redeeming the Stargate franchise and reminding us just how great Stargate was in its heyday.  The only missing link in this film was an appearance by Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill.

One of the major positives about this movie is that each character gets his or her moments to shine.  Tel'c especially has a wonderful scene with Tomin in which they discuss the terrible things they've done and about the idea of forgiveness.  Probably was one of finest moments for Christopher Judge in years.  Another stand-out is the character of Cam Mitchell.  In his two years on the series I never really warmed to this character, which always surprised me since I'm such a huge fan of Ben Browder's performance in Farscape.  In this movie, I think the character really comes into his own as an individual and a leader.  Of course, Sam and Daniel have their great moments, and the saving grace of Stargate's final two seasons, Vala, is as funny and dramatic as ever. Claudia Black is truly an underused actress. Her scenes with Tomin (played wonderfully by Tim Guinee) are some of the best in the movie.

It goes without saying the special effects were as good or better than the series, which were already fantastic for something made on low-budget cable money.  It's also worth mentioning the music was great and reminded me a lot of the music in the original Stargate movie.

This is not the best film for new viewers of Stargate, but a nice prelude that catches you up is included on the DVD, so new viewers shouldn't stay away. What this film does is tie up the loose ends from season 10 of Stargate SG-1 and allow for the beginning of some new adventures.  I eagerly await the next film, Stargate: Continuum.",1205625600,4,2338,4.502369668246446
3292272,2,B0010YSD7M,"I bought this movie with high hopes that the writers, producers, and directors would take the direct to dvd movie series to the next level, beyond the television series - and was severely disappointed. There was very little in this dvd that felt like a movie, with the exception of 1 or 2 cuss words (rather contrived way to separate the movie from the tv show), and the opening sequence which did have a broad, sweeping feel to it.

There were 2 other scenes which felt ""larger"" than a tv episode - one we had seen in the trailers (where the production company spent most of the 7 million dollar budget on special effects) as the ship moves through the SuperGate. The other is Teal'c journey across miles of beautiful and breathtaking terrain to find the rest of his team.

But none of that was nearly enough to sway my overall opinion of this stretched out episdoe.

If you are a Cam Mitchell fan, buy the movie. If you enjoy movies with over extended battle and fight scenes - and I mean scenes that NEVER seem to end, buy the movie.

However, if you are expecting to see a movie with a storyline that is full of character development and interaction between the leads, give this one a big MISS.

The plot holes in this story are large enough to drive a Mack Truck through.  The largest one, Teal'c wakes up after being shot in a fight and knows - precisely - which direction to take to find the rest of the team?  Even though they have been carted miles and miles away?  I found myself actually exclaiming outloud - what a Load! during that scene. The Jaffa suddenly has esp or something? Is this some sort of side effect of long term exposure to Tretonin?  Whatever.

I had hoped to see something that felt more like a movie and less like an episode - but should have known better when the same people who wrote, directed, and produced the series worked on this project and the next upcoming direct to DVD movie - Continuum. Even with Richard Dean Anderson's appearance in that film, I will most likely rent it before I buy it in an attempt to avoid a $19.99 mistake.",1205625600,5,2072,4.400523560209424

I don't know why I couldn't connect with Ben Browder's character since I'm a huge fan of his work.  But, somehow in the Ark of Truth he pulled off bringing Mitchell into my heart as much as O'Neil.

3292278,2,B0010YSD7M,"As a fan who has watched the show from the beginning and has loved it all along, I must say that this film was overall a disappointment.

But let me start with some positives.  The production values of the film were awesome, and I loved the location filming in the mountains.  The photography in this was quite beautifully done.  And the actors did magnificent as always.  I also liked the elements of the story involving Tomin and his facing the actions he took as an Ori soldier, with Teal'c being the one most interested in and capable of helping him through it.  This also gave Christopher Judge a chance to really show his dramatic acting capabilities, when most of the time his role is based more on physicality.

But beyond that, I thought that the film had three major flaws that detracted from the quality and enjoyability of the film.  One-the whole plot device of the Ark of Truth was an overly simplistic solution to the Ori problem.  Open a box, let a Prior see it, and all the Ori followers will see the error of their ways and be nice from now on.  Come on!!  I know that they had to come up with some kind of simplified solution to the Ori problem because they didn't have a whole season to wrap the story, but this was a just plain stupid idea!

Two-bringing back the replicators!!  As soon as I saw that metallic bug, I hung my head and went ""Argh, give me a (bleeping) break!""  The replicators were a lot of fun for a villain back when they were first introduced, but at this point, they have just gotten old!  I'm sick of them!  They've almost become an excuse for them to bring out big guns with really big ammo magazines so they can show a plethera of clips of really loud guns being fired by really cool looking dudes!  They could've thrown in Jean Claude Van Damm and made this a B action film.  I think if they had focused on the Ori story instead of devoting a full third of the film to the replicators, the film might have been much better served!  Instead, I felt like I had seen all of the replicator stuff before.  Of course, I had, in Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and a whole lot in Season 8!

Third-the replicator element brings us to the final problem I had with this film-Replicator Man!  At least, that's what I like to call the replicator-controlled zombie that Colonel Mitchell fights.  Through this whole sequence, I thought I was watching some cheesy zombie film mixed in with a little action-movie style fight scenes.  Replicator Man was a stupid enough plot device on its own, but then the sequence dragged on and on and on.  Only Ben Browder's whit in between the punches kept me even partially interested.

As I said, disappointing film overall that had some good points, but was rather poorly executed in terms of writing and plot.  Here's hoping for something better with Continuum.",1205539200,48,2818,4.453125

3292282,5,B0010YSD7M,"I pre-ordered this on 12/08/07 & Amazon shipped it to me ahead of the 3/11/08 release date so I had it early (USA).

I own all 10 seasons of SG-1, the original movie, SGA Rising, SG AoT, and plan to purchase Continuum. I will continue to buy all DVD offerings from SG-1 & SGA. There are not many shows I watch but SG-1, SGA, BSG, Firefly, X Files, & Terminator SCC are the type of shows I am interested in with SG-1 & SGA my favorites.

I have only watched AoT once (and the extra features) but the imagery and on location scenery including sets are wonderful. Character interaction, trademark humor, and pace of the episode/movie are great. Great action sequences and FX. When I watch it again I am sure I will enjoy it as much or more.

Any show or movie will have some flaws but overall Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis have been thoroughly fantastic for me and I dread the eventuality of NO new shows or movies from SG.

3292283,5,B0010YSD7M,"If you are reading this, yes, all night 4 times... no, not that, I have seen it 4x now.  A lot of ""answers"" packed into an epic style true movie with dynamic visuals and sound.  As a fan for all 10 years and all 10 seasons on DVD... I'm liken this a lot.

Cam and Sam lead the way with Cam really coming into his SG-1 role as leader and commander and he does it very well and naturally.  Something that took 2 seasons to come into, but he does with great satisfaction.

Sam continues well and as expected in a true to character role as a declared ""I got your back"" team member.  Have you noticed she addresses Cam as ""Cam"" and not sir?  I never heard her say ""Jack"".  These two continue the first name basis.  If you've notice the last few season a very subtle affection growing between Sam and Cam, it continues here with a closing scene that is ""just right"", but I could see more in the next production.  It's clear she accepts his leadership and is fond of him all at the same time while not breaking regulations.  She is a bit ""sexier"" a few times too.

Daniel is true blue also nothing out of character, but finally manages to get the Ancients to cooperate and interven on behalf of human kind... finally.

Teal'c also is spot on in his traditional role in doing anything he can to forge ahead, enduring, strong, spiritual and finally ""helped"" by a ""touch"" from the Ancients too.  Nice.

Vala, except for the first scene, finally ""settles down"" and is less annoying in this 'episode' than so many of the others.  She is finally a full team member, is receptive and ""tuned in"" to Daniel while handling her relationship with all her men with calm and maturity... nice to see as her previous ""methods"" always kept me ""away"" from liking her character.

All the rest of the cast and crew are here too, no one is left out and Landry, Walter and others all do their ""standard"" stuff, no tricks.

Morgan Lafay finally reveals all with Daniel, cooperates with him after his torture, has mercy and finally... finally steps in on behalf of the Ancients.  Divine intervention that is the only way to deal with Adria.  I identify with this personally as I often feel things could ""work out"" here on earth IF we could just get some help once in awhile.

No spoilers here, but the IOA finally ""intrudes"" in a way that almost costs us our human civilization in the Milky Way Galaxy by hijacking the ""approved"" mission to find the Ark with an alternative ""plan"" set forth in a ""rogue"" fashion that proves to be catostrophic and Sam and Cam gotta deal with the Replicators... yes, again.

No ""alternate reality"" stuff either... straight on adventure and challenges that all ends well and leaves me feeling ""satisfied"" after 10 years with my favorite TV show ever.  ""They"" could have made a mistake trying to be spectacular to extreme and go overboard, but this is an epic long adventure that's true to a movie form with action and adventure and ""hanging on till the end"" and that is the way it should be and the way ""we all"" want to remember this great series.",1205539200,3,3047,4.440647482014389
3292284,3,B0010YSD7M,"The ""Ark of Truth"" is basically what should have/would have been 3 or even 4 episode had the series continued on television.
But it's not.  It's a rather hurried 100 minutes of a mixed story line retreading the same themes: replicators endangering the ship and crew, the ""evil"" manipulations of the IOA, the uncompleted Ori story line, the small band of humans overcoming impossible odds to save the galaxy and mankind etc.
Frankly it leaves lot's of plot questions unanswered by its conclusion, just too many gaps in the story along with inconsistencies with the ""Stargate history"".  It does have some of the back story explaining the issues between the Ori and the Ancients and the creation of the Ark.

Robert Cooper wrote, directed and produced this direct to DVD video. I find doing all three things generally doesn't lead to better movies or videos.  Besides the weak story and plot line, the dialog is rather flat compared to numerous other SG-1 episodes.  Based on reviews I've seen, SG-1 fans will likely enjoy the DVD movie, but it is not the best effort of the series.

Image quality is good and looks nice upscaled by a Toshiba HD-A20 on a 62inch screen.  The accompanying sound track is ok.

PS
Have not yet watched the story behind extra (the DVD is really light in extras).  The prelude is a quick set of snippet from the entire Ori story arc, but is just that snippets (or visual sound bites).  It does nothing to advance the story.

HOWEVER, there was nothing new here. It was an extended episode. What was worse was the whole plot thread that seemed to be added by a fan of the Terminator. It was cheap and a waste.

Christopher Judge, in particular, is given a plumb piece of dialog delivered with just the right amount of gravitas.

I have to preface this review with the statement that I am an avid Stargate fan, and as such, my review may be biased (but I think not!)

After enduring season 4 of Atlantis this year, it is nice to get back to the show I truly love, Sg-1.  Opposed to Atlantis, SG-1 takes place on earth, spends time on the explorations, and takes into account ancient mythologies, opposed to Atlantis, which is more action oriented, with dumbed down dialog, and shooting anything that moves.

I have been awaiting this release since it was announced, it finally came to my home yesterday, I watched the movie, then the extras (comic con conference which was really cool! and a behind the scenes which was great as well (this is almost 1 hour of material), I then watched the movie again, this time with commentary (again, I love SG-1).

This dvd has a ""prelude"" which basically goes over everything you need to freshen up on to fully enjoy and prepare for this viewing.  As someone who has seen each episode of stargate countless times, I found this prelude a great review, as it has been a while since I watched it all.

The movie then follows, and it is a great movie. The scenery in this movie is astounding, it looks much better than we are used to seeing on the TV show.  The pacing is slower, more akin to when the show aired on Showtime, which works well, as the aspect of stargate that i enjoy most, is the interactions between the characters, the explorations of new worlds and civilizations, and how everyone reacts to the culture.

This brings the conclusion to a satisfying end.  I think several of the cliffhangers are drawn out a bit much (putting a tad too much tension near the end), but all in all, I enjoyed the movie.

This reminds me of why I love this show, I know they are coming out with another movie soon (this one will have Richard Dean Anderson in it), and word on the streets is, it should arrive this July.

I truly hope people are not just downloading bootleg copies of this dvd, and I really hope everyone will buy this dvd, and the next one.  I really want this show to continue on, if the studios do not get the results they are looking for, this could be the end.

I really hope the dvds do sell well, maybe they can continue to do movies throughout the year, and maybe even a mini series or another season.  There are many aspects of the Stargate world that have gone unexplored, and unfinished.

I hope the producers read this review, and understand that what make stargate work is not the snappy dialog, the wonderful interactions, the brilliantly designed enemies, sound design, artwork, and constant tension, but the exploration of new worlds, the ability to learn something (ancient history, see ancient figures, the Egyptian gods) and the exploration of these foreign cultures.  Something Stargate Atlantis completely misses, which is why I do not enjoy it as much.

I truly hope everyone will buy this dvd, enjoy it, and more get made.

I also must comment on the beautiful video quality and sound design, the show has never looked or sounded this good (they did use 35mm film) and it shows.

Please keep up the great work, and I hope everyone enjoys this fantastic dvd.

(note, if you are a fan of the movie, and haven't watched too much of the series (last 2 seasons--9 and 10) this dvd is likely not for you, do yourself a favor, and buy the complete series collection, and catch up, then enjoy this fantastic dvd, as you will not be able to understand much of what is going on)

Also, the creators of the show, are working on a third show, that deals with the ninth chevron, tentatively called ""Stargate Universe"" which is set in present time.  I really hope this will be the return of intellectual Stargate, and I eagerly await its arrival on TV.",1205366400,101,3809,4.512372634643377
3292302,4,B0010YSD7M,"First a note to fans of the 1994 MOVIE:
If you are not familiar with Stargate SG-1 the television show, this is not the movie for you.  In case you are unsure of what this product is, it's a continuation of the Television series of the same name.  If you've only seen the movie, you'll want to start with the first season DVD of SG1.

Now on to the review:
Overall I think this was a very enjoyable film.  It picks up right where the final season had ended.  It deals mostly with the ORI and serves to wrap up that story arc.  The production values were very high and when it was all said and done, I had a very good time.  That doesn't mean there weren't issues, though.  But most are pretty minor and not worth nit-picking here.

The Plot (No Spoilers Version):
SG1 is looking for an Ancient artifact called the Ark of Truth (obviously) in the hopes that it will help them to defeat the Ori, a race of ascended zealots who feed off the worship of their ... well, worshipers.

The story takes us to several familiar settings and sees the return of many popular characters from the 9th and 10th seasons of the show.  It also adds some new faces as well!  Sadly, Richard Dean Anderson does not make an appearance as Jack O'Neill.  Robert Picardo is also absent (now part of the Atlantis mission) as Woozy.  However the rest of the SG1 gang is all here.

Fans of the Star Gate SG1 series will definitely want to add this film to their collection.  You'll easily be able to overlook it's shortcomings and enjoy it for what it is ... a film about our favorite characters from a great series and a wrap up to 10 great years of television.  I look forward to seeing what they have coming next with their release of Continuum this summer!",1205366400,3,1731,4.309597523219814
3292303,4,B0010YSD7M,"The Ark of Truth is supposed to tie up all the hanging storylines from the sadly cancelled Stargate series.  However, there are still unresolved stories -- like whatever happened to the Harsesis (spelling correct?) child, or Laira from A Hundred Days, or the Tok'ra.  Were all the Tolans really killed, so whatever happened to Schroedinger the cat?  What about the Furlings, and who are the enemy/rescuers in episodes Enemies and Grace?  The Ori story thankfully comes to an end, but not a spectacular one.  It would have been far more interesting to have gotten all the Ancients to finally have battled the Ori, but the writers didn't go there.  Still, this episode is quite good, with really fine acting from Shanks and Tapping and Judge.  For the Farscape cast, Claudia Black seems a bit out of character, like she's tired of Vala (so am I) -- and a grinning Tomin doesn't seem quite right either -- but Browder does well, right in character, though he does get beaten up a lot.  The soundtrack is often intrusive, as if they want you to know that this is a true film and not just part of the series, where the soundtrack never intruded.  And there are portions that include singing like Gregorian chants, okay if you like that stuff but annoying otherwise.  Sorry to say, the writers also brought back an old, dead plot element -- it seems like whenever they don't know what to do, either in SG-1 or Atlantis, they resurrect the replicators.  Ho-hum.  And at the end, they could have spent a bit more time building the drama, since for me it fell a little flat.  I did enjoy Beau Bridges, who is the best of the Stargate generals.  Despite some disappointments, though, it's an entertaining episode, although I have to admit the the second time I viewed it, I got a little bored . . .",1205366400,6,1788,4.581761006289308
3292304,5,B0010YSD7M,"First off I am reviewing the retail release of this movie. Not a bootleg version minus the special effects and score.
 I liked the movie and it is good to have closure of the season 10 plot line. I have been a long time fan and while I am not fond of the Cameron Mitchell and Vala characters I suppose they served to help carry the plot in Rick Dean's absence. Besides, ""props"" must be given to Farscape and if this is what it takes for them to pay the bills, I will play along.

 All in all this is a must buy if you want to close the story arc of season 10.",1205366400,2,559,3.8859649122807016
3292305,5,B0010YSD7M,"Quite honestly, a lot of the time a film that gets high reviews just doesn't live up to the hype.  Fortunately, this wasn't one of them!  In part because of the other reviews on this site, and in part because of the quality of the show, I went into the experience with high expectations.  I'm glad to say that the movie did NOT disappoint!

The writers, cast, and crew did an excellent job wrapping up the loose ends from the series (although because of the timing of the releases, I'm a bit confused about where the movie exists -- with Carter LEADING Atlantis AND still an active member of SG-1, I'm trying to figure out how she seems to be in two places at the same time...) and the end of the movie is very satisfying.  (When it ended, all I could think was ""And... THAT's why I love this show!"" == with a bit of Mitchell's enthusiasm...)

Unfortunately, there isn't much here for viewers who haven't been following the series -- especially the last few seasons.  So if you're looking to start with a movie, my suggestion would be to begin with either the original Stargate film or with the pilot for the first season.

There ARE a few surprises for fans, though, even while they are working to wrap up the series.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bigger budget shows in the quality of the sound and picture.  One nice thing about the longer format (aside from just getting more of the good stuff) is that they took the time to really develop the film and bring everything together without it seeming like they wrapped everything up in the last five or ten minutes with a deus ex or some other plot contrivance.

In short, if you're a fan of the series, you have GOT to buy this!  (This is my first review on Amazon.com, and I felt like I just HAD to say something.  If any of the writers, cast, or crew happen to read this, GREAT job!)",1205280000,,1843,4.353801169590644
3292306,5,B0010YSD7M,"Spoilers are fun, but I'm going to be careful not to give anything away here, since not everyone agrees with me about the fun thing. I have to say up front that I loved the movie, not so much because it was the best episode of the series but because this was the series wrap-up that was missing from the final episodes of season 10. I liked how the arcs came together and how the characters seemed just as easy to like as always. The action was dramatic and exciting and drove the story to a satisfying conclusion.

If you liked Tomin from the series, you'll enjoy seeing him again here. He plays a key role, and I was thrilled to see his character again. I also liked the parallels between him and Teal'c.

I imagine the show will be easy to watch again and I'm already looking forward to seeing certain scenes replayed.

Despite my love of Stargate and my love of this show, it had its flaws.

To be frank, I thought most of the tricks that were meant to make the movie more like a ""real"" movie were a waste of time and storytelling space. Thinking back, I must say that this wasn't any better (if not even as good) as many of the two part episodes from the series, such as The Lost City, Full Circle, Exodus/Enemies, and others.

Many of the characters seemed to be stick figures. Landry's part in the movie could just as easily have been left out for all but one scene. Teal'c's ""walk"" seemed unlikely at best, and blatantly ridiculous at worst. The difference between the feel of the movie and the series jarred.

However, I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Stargate SG-1. It's a lovely tribute to the last two years of the series.",1205280000,3,1660,4.373376623376624
3292307,1,B0010YSD7M,"I used to love Stargate.  But maybe it was the departure of Richard Dean Anderson, I don't know.  But the last few seasons have been extremely repetitive and tiresome.  Random Ancient artifact saves the day.  The Ark of Truth is no exception.  The only character that gets any decent character development is Tomin when he has a change of heart.  Otherwise it's the same ole tired formula.  1) Find Ancient artifact.  2) magically decipher it despite how ridiculously old and advanced it is. 3) Save the day.  4) Lather rinse repeat.  It was bad enough that the first seasons of Stargate dealt with Humans miraculously defeating an enemy that was vastly more advanced and had been in power for thousands of years.  But my suspension of disbelief simply cannot tolerate simple humans fighting virtual deities and somehow winning.  It is extremely disappointing to see Stargate fall so far.",1205280000,15,888,4.925675675675675
3292308,5,B0010YSD7M,"I just received the DVD today.  I have been a huge fan of Stargate since the original movie.  I was very dissapointed when SciFi channel cut SG1, especially since they replaced it whith ECW.  Of course, now I do not watch SciFi channel that much. Just to see Stargate Atlantis and a couple other shows.
The movie The Ark of Truth should be a huge success.  It is well acted and the music score is outstanding. I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the whole movie as things went from bad to worse for SG1.  Before seeing that there is another movie pending, I was concerned that SG1 was going to get killed off in a way similar to what was done to Farscape. Fortunately this did not happen, though I thought one of the SG1 Team would be killed off at a couple points during the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes SciFi and especially to any Stargate SG1 fan.",1205280000,2,882,4.226190476190476

3292310,4,B0010YSD7M,"Excellent ending to Stargate SG-1. An Epic space battle would have been more fun. The very end kinda sucked, but I suppose it leaves room for more SG-1 movies (which would be good by the way). They seemed a little desperate to add conflict by adding the replicators. But overall the replicators were a good familiar foe to tie the movie with the series.",1205280000,,353,4.53125
3292311,3,B0010YSD7M,"* Spoilers
Being a very big fan of the series, I must say that this was somewhat of a disappointment.  There was enough in this 102 minute movie to expand into at least one season.  Another annoying thing about the movie is that the Replicators, which I consider to be the best enemy in all of Stargate Sg-1, was introduced and are defeated in the same movie?  If they wanted to bring the Replicators back, they should have had a seperate movie for the Replicators.  The Replicators also made it so that the only people actually helping at all at finding the Ark of Truth are Daniel, Vala, and Tealc.  Sam and Cam are busy fighting the Replicators and don't contribute that much to the Ori ending.  It was good, but I had seen several season finales that were much better than this movie.",1205280000,4,788,4.4375
3292312,5,B0010YSD7M,"Leaving the Ori storyline unresolved at the end of Sg-1's final season, the makers of the show give us this film. The Ark Of Truth lives up the hype of fans hoping for an epic end to the storyline that drove the show's final two seasons.  Indeed, The Ark Of Truth proves to be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline.

In fact one might go so far as to assume that the show never ended. From the performances of SG-1's members, it's just like picking up where Unending left off. In particular Michael Shanks and Ben Browder both get to shine in their roles of Daniel Jackson and Cameron Mitchell. That's not to say the rest of cast doesn't, but Shanks and Browder really do stand out in this. The supporting cast does too from Beau Bridges to Sarah Strange, from Sarah Strange to the villainous Julian Sands and the absolutely evil Morena Baccarin. The real stand out of the supporting cast however is Currie Graham as Merrick, the double crossing IOA supervisor.

The rest of the production is also first rate for the film, in both writing and production values, is epic. There is a scope to the film that wasn't possible for the show on television. The story feels epic, taking us from Earth to the Ori galaxy and back again. The story has so much going on though that we don't get to see some of the things fans would like to have seen but we see enough to keep everyone happy. The effects and photography aren't just as good as they were on the show, they're better. They go from mountains in the opening credits, the ruins of Dakarra and the Altaran city, to the Ark itself: something that was hard (if not impossible) for the series to do with even a two-part two of the series. There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. There's one other thing to mention: the music. The music by Joel Goldsmith is just as epic as the film, evoking not just the original Stargate theme by David Arnold but the Germanic chants of the Ori themes and heroic themes for the team. But the real treat of the music is that while it may be familiar, you've never heard it played this. Fans of the series won't be disappointed. Everything that made us love the series is still here and thriving.

Not to say the film is perfect, which it isn't. Some parts of the film don't make a lot of sense such as the IOA's actions. They don't make much sense especially when they resurrect an old enemy from the series in the process. I won't spoil it because it makes for a great plot twist, but in retrospect it just feels like padding. There's also the odd flashbacks to the Altarans involving the Ark which, while they add some texture, really might not have been needed. But these are minor flaws, and its hard to find anything without any.

The DVD has bonus features for any of the series to enjoy. From Comic-Con to a making of documentary, fans get the chance to go behind the scenes of the film and its promotion. There's also a short semi-preview of the second direct to DVD SG-1 movie to tease fans with. But the mains tar of the bonus features is the commentary by writer/director Robert C. Cooper, cinematographer Peter Woeste, and actor Christopher Judge. Their commentary talks about not just the making of the film, but the attempts to make the film larger and better then the series and the difficulties in doing so. For fans the commentary is a must-hear.

In short, The Ark Of Truth is a good film. It does exactly what it was supposed to do: be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline. It succeeds for the most part, though it does have some flaws to it. While non-fans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catch-up on all the plotlines going on in the film, fans should enjoy it. If this and Continuum, the yet to be released second film, are to be the final end of Stargate SG-1, they will be the fitting end of the series.",1205280000,5,3931,4.356070941336971
3292313,4,B0010YSD7M,"Beginning with the opening credits, 'Stargate - The Ark of Truth' shows that writer/producer/director Robert Cooper wants this movie to be more than just an extended version of the SG-1 television show. Does he succeed in turning the SG-1 world into a full length movie? To a large degree, yes, and he does it while remaining true to the spirit and flavor of the TV series.

'Coop' (familiar to many SG-1 viewers as a writer since first season) uses much of his expanded budget to bring a cinematic quality to the movie.  Some gorgeous panoramic mountain scenes back the opening credits, and later in the film he drops a major character on the same mountain tops to be shot via helicopter, reminiscent of some of the photography in Jackson's Lord of the Rings. Unlike the later episodes of the TV series which were shot in HD video, the Ark of Truth was shot on 35 mm film like a feature film, and it shows in the richness of the cinematography (by Peter Woeste, Director of Photography on the TV series). The special effects in the SG-1 series have almost always been high quality, but in the movie the extra budget shows up in the extended CGI work. Composer Joel Goldsmith (also with the show since the first season) is allowed to work with a full orchestra, and his music is a great support to the onscreen action and moods. As the opening credits roll, you may notice a difference in the SG-1 theme song reminiscent of the original Stargate feature film - a very effective way to bring a larger and slightly different feel to the Ark of Truth, and a good example of the handling of the transition from TV to movie.

The premise is fairly simple - tie up the Ori story arc that was left hanging in season 10. The basic plot is predictable since we are shown the potential solution to the Ori problem in an opening scene flashback to the million year old civilization of the Alterans, but the fun is in getting there. The various twists that occur manage to split the team up and put the members of SG-1 into the usual tight spots, something viewers of the series are familiar with. This kind of development is true to the flavor of the series since its first season. Some will be disappointed at the return of an old nemesis, but others will appreciate it as a nostalgic complication to an already hopeless situation.

The actors brought their well-established characters to this movie, and there's not a bad performance in the bunch. Their enjoyment of working with each other, and their off-screen friendships, are very evident as on-screen chemistry. Samantha Carter (played by Amanda Tapping) was a bit underutilized, but her character performs the usual miracles under pressure. Cam Mitchell (Ben Browder) amusingly accepts command of the Odyssey for the voyage to the Ori galaxy, and manages to quip humorously even as he gets the life beat out of him. Vala Maldoran (Claudia Black) is her usual sarcastic, slightly devious, yet vulnerable and funny self. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) gives a very strong emotional performance in one scene, demonstrating the personal toll that the whole ancient/ascension experience has taken on him over the years. And Teal'c (Christopher Judge) addresses the issue of how he has dealt with (or not dealt with) his past, where he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. It provides the motivation for the act he performs later in the movie, which is one of Tealc's great moments in the SG-1 mythology.

Viewers of the series will recognize other regulars and guests, including Beau Bridges (General Landry), Gary Jones (Chief Master Sergeant Walter Harriman), Morena Baccarin (Vala's daughter Adria), Eric Brecker (Colonel Reynolds), Martin Christopher (Major Marks), Doug Abrahams (Prior #2), and Julian Sands as the Doci. There are two special guest appearances of note. Tim Guinee reprises his recurring series role as Tomin, husband of Vala in the Ori galaxy. He gives an excellent performance beginning where the series left off, as a true believer in Origin, but a doubting agent of the priors, and he grows throughout the movie to become an ally with a special bond to Teal'c. Currie Graham plays Merrick, a very unlikable ex-CIA operative turned agent of the bureaucratic I.O.A., who is responsible for some major peril SG-1 faces. I won't spoil it for you, but his character is dealt with in a very satisfying manner. ;-)

The DVD includes a commentary track with Robert Cooper, Peter Woeste, and Christopher Judge that is reasonably informative and entertaining. Special features include a filmed panel discussion at a recent Comic-Con that will have you laughing out loud, and a good 'making-of' documentary. There is also a 'Prelude to the Ark of Truth', which recaps the entire Ori story arc from the series; very helpful if you have not watched the shows in a while. The packaging is good with a sturdy plastic case in a cardboard sleeve.

I found little to complain about with this DVD, but it is not perfect. As attractive as the cinematography is, I think Cooper probably spent a little too much time and money trying to bring a cinematic feel to the movie when the extra screen time would have been better spent dealing with the story and characters.  There are the usual 'homages' to other movies which can come across as unoriginal, but the series has always been full of these, and the writers/directors have always taken great pleasure in emulating shots from their favorite movies. (Look for nods to ""Star Wars"", ""The Terminator"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in this one.) There is a scene where the use of a slanted view from a shaky handheld camera is distracting and seems inappropriate to the moment, but most of the camera work is superb and matches the mood.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that the movie tries to fit so much into a limited time that it feels rushed. I found myself wishing for more details on the Alteran civilization, more of the usual SG-1 exploration, and more character moments.  As it is, the story could easily have taken 3 episodes of the TV series, and with expanded details and more character beats, even more. But it is better for a movie to make you want more, than making you want it to end earlier.

Bottom line, this is well-produced fun entertainment, with characters you can care about, with enough action to keep it moving, while remaining true to the spirit of the SG-1 world. And most importantly, I found it to be a satisfying (if rushed) ending to the Ori story arc.  If you have not seen the series, you will definitely be confused, even after watching the 'Prelude' first. If you are someone that feels the series went south after Richard Dean Anderson left, then you won't like this movie because it deals with the SG-1 of the last two seasons.  In that case you might want to check out the latest SG-1 movie 'Continuum' where Don Davis and R.D.A. make brief appearances.

5 stars for cinematography and acting, 4 starts for story line, 3 stars for originality and pace.  Give it a 4 overall.  All in all, this is a good ending to the series, and a good beginning for more direct-to-disk releases.  I hope the DVD does well enough that more will be made in the future.",1205280000,,7213,4.734661354581673

The cinematography and other production values were WAY better than most of the movies I've seen in theaters in the last few years.  This is not your father's direct-to-DVD movie.

The prelude (which can be skipped entirely, viewed on its own, or viewed as an intro to the movie) was a nice ""Previously on Stargate SG-1,"" but it's not enough of a Cliff's Notes to introduce someone to SG-1.

Something SG-1 has not had time to do for a couple years. Let's face it most of us have missed Jack and the exploring they use to do. The bulk of the movie is finding a weapon to destroy the Ori, but it turns out it is not where they first thought and when they find it, it doesn't do what they originally thought either. However they are victorious and there are changes of loyalty from a place you might not expect. Overall I was not at all disappointed, but I must admit the scene with Teal'c walking across a desert after being shot by a Ori weapon was a bit much.

The wife and I were a bit disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't even put in a cameo appearance. Excellent production values as always, they won't seem better as the TV series was so good that we were all spoiled by them. The DVD includes plenty of extras including a prelude you can play previous to watching the movie. The prelude is snapshot segments from several episodes from the last two seasons and that lead up to the final battle.

No spoilers here, but they do a decent job of tying up the loose ends in the Ori saga, or at least as good a job as you can do in 1.5 hours. Remember, it took them 40 episodes over 2 seasons (30 hours of video) to lead up to this, so in some ways I with they'd taken at least 120 minutes to tie it up, but it's still well worth the watch. It's got all the classic interplay between the characters, the comedy, the tension, the action, it just reinforces why we all loved this series, and how nuts SciFi was to not renew it. Maybe they'll see the error of their ways? :)

Production quality is superb, the wide shots w/the mountain ranges are amazing, and as several have said, only a feature affords them the time and $$ to make shots like this. Special effects are great, and some of the explosion scenes are quite interesting, especially after you watch the DVD extras and see how they did it.

Speaking of bonus material, the bit at comic-con is absolutely hilarious. Gary Jones (Chief Mst Sgt. Walter Harriman, you know, the ""receiving IDC"" guy) MCs it, and while I get the occasional chuckle out of SG1, I had a couple of out-loud laughs at this Q&A w/the cast of SG1 (well, except for  Michael Shanks (Daniel) who was, well, you'll see).

One thing... please, please, please tell me they filmed this in HD and there will be a BlueRay Director's cut released after Continuum later this year.

3292318,5,B0010YSD7M,"Stargate: Ark of Truth marks the first of at least two movies, direct to DVD, that reunites the cast of SG1.  Daniel Jackson has had a vision of a weapon that will finally give Earth the ability to defeat the evil Ori.  SG1 sets out to recover the item and once and for all defeat the Ori.  This is a pretty standard plot for the series.

Is it very original?  No.  Does it sometimes feel rushed?  Yes, much as the ending to story arcs in the TV show often felt rushed.  Is it a whole lot of fun?  Oh, yeah, you better believe it.  Action, humor, cool special effects, and great characters are all things which permeated SG1 the tv series and the movie is no exception.  As a bonus, more refined cinematography and better sets help the viewer to feel like he is watching a true feature length movie.

The DVD has a few extra features; there is a great segment from a comic convention that is really funny (Browder, Tapping, and Judge answer fan questions), and the making of featurette provides a great look at how the film was made.

If you liked all ten seasons of SG1, you will love this movie.  If you were never much of a fan of the show, or if you didn't like the Ori story arc, then this movie probably won't interest you.  Fans of the show can rejoice; they have a well done Stargate movie in Ark of Truth that delivers all the thrills of the original show.",1205193600,,1365,4.236434108527132
3292319,5,B0010YSD7M,"This is a great movie which finishes the Ori story from Seasons 9 & 10. It closes many of the open questions. The acting is great, SFX are even better, and there is an incredible story too. I felt there was so much more to tell of the SG-1 story and this movie fills the void. Buy this movie!!!",1205193600,,294,4.0
3292320,4,B0010YSD7M,"I saw it Today, and was impressed. I cannot wait for the next installment to come out this Summer. The only drawback was: Not enough Claudia Black.

3292321,5,B0010YSD7M,"This film, the baby of Stargate franchise writer and producer Robert C. Cooper, proves that direct to DVD is a viable second life for Stargate SG-1. While the film manages to just reach ""big screen"" production values, it really feels like an extended length episode - and that's not a bad thing. It feels good, and familiar.

Regular viewers know the plot line of this story arc, and want to see the resolution that the Sci-Fi cable channel preempted by canceling the show. The movie does not disappoint here. The loose ends are tied up, with a couple of new twists added to the mix to keep the audience on their toes. All of the character relationships are intact and the canon of the show has not been violated in the slightest. For viewers who know Stargate SG-1, but aren't familiar with the arc of this story line, a ""Previously on Stargate SG-1"" extended prelude sequence is provided. As a regular viewer of the franchise, I even found it helpful in jogging the memory of a few plot points from season 9 of the series.

With the actors being completely comfortable in their characters, the performances are just what the Stargate viewer wants. Cooper does a very good job of directing  actors and a story he's very familiar with. The movie was made using film cameras, as opposed to the more recent use of the Hi-Def video format of the series. As good as Hi-Def ""film"" is, there IS something about 35 mm film resolution that lends to the big scale feel of the movie. The visual effects, having been completed by Stargate's in-house facility, are familiar and comfortable. But, their scale is wider and more time has obviously been invested in ensuring the visuals live up to ""movie"" standards.

The only criticism I would make is that the pacing occasionally DID feel like this was an episode, rather than a movie - a bit ironic in as much as much was made by the producers and cast about how liberating the ""2 hour"" format was. Two particular sequences seemed a bit glossed over, with one character setting off without a solid explanation of ""how,"" while the situation three other characters find themselves in doesn't get treated with enough depth. But, that is minor, because the third act sets up a scenario that places most of the leading characters into great danger. Even though we know that the resolution will be successful, it doesn't take away from the jeopardy because of the earlier mentioned completely unexpected plot twist. Act 4 resolves the story and set SG-1 up for further adventures in this direct to disc format.

The disc itself has wonderful ""special features,"" including the treat of watching the actors, as themselves, at the ComicCon convention in San Diego. Having attended one Creative produced Stargate convention, with the opportunity to meet and hear stories from Michael Shanks and Christopher Judge, I know how much fun the folks at the San Diego convention had.

I feel that my enthusiasm and money was well spent on this film, and that it was worth the wait. I certainly don't find paying such a small price for more SG-1 movies, and I think MGM and the Stargate brain trust at The Bridge have found a wonderful way of keeping the shows alive.  I'm looking forward to the upcoming ""Stargate Continuum"" release in July, and hope that the production team can get another film in the pipeline soon.",1205193600,2,3338,4.715265866209262
3292322,4,B0010YSD7M,"I have been a huge Stargate fan since the beginning.  When the series ended it felt incomplete.  The current story arc was not finished.  This movie did what it needed to do:  it put a satisfying bow on the package.

This extended episode has all the elements that made Stargate a phenomenal series.  As always, the writing and dialogue are excellent, the characters have fun and interact well, the sets and effects are what we have come to expect, the plot was fast paced and interesting, and there were balanced amounts of humor and tension and of action and science.  The musical underscoring was superb.  It added to the story, and was delightful to listen to.  And of course, good triumphs over evil, and our heroes ride off to their next adventure, hinting at even more to come.

There are only two minor issues with The Ark of Truth.  1.  No Jack.  I really like the new SG-1, but I miss Jack.  2.  As stated earlier, the movie completes the Ori story arc, but it did no more.  It had all the excellent elements of the series, but no more.  As a movie, I would have expected them to go farther than they would in an episode, to be even bigger and better.

Overall, I was not disappointed, as I had been with the ""last"" episode. Every fan of Stargate will love Ark of Truth.",1205193600,2,1280,4.374468085106383

However, the rest of you should know that this is a truly well executed film. Not only does it serve to encapsulate Stagate SG-1's nonexistent 11th season, but it takes the plot, characters and production values to unseen heights. I encourage you to buy this DVD for your own pleasure, but if not for that, then for the rest of us who want to encourage many more amazing films like this one.",1205193600,,524,4.412371134020619

It's a great plot with excellent writing, great effects, and the usual excellent acting and directing with most of the characters we've grown to think of as part of our family.  I loved the film and look forward to the next, and hope they will not end the SG-1 franchise there.  The only thing that could have made the film better would have been an appearance by Jack O'Neill.  This is a must buy for anyone who is a scifi fan.",1205193600,,570,4.380952380952381

It was everything I hoped for, and more. I really, really hope there will be more SG1 moves after the second one comes out.

I had to go to 2 stores to find it today, the day it came out. And the copy I got was the last in the store. Hopefully, its doing as well elsewhere.",1205193600,,443,3.868131868131868

About the only two things I wish would have been done differently is 1)I kind of wish Richard Dean Anderson was in it but then maybe thats just because it's hard not to think about SG1 without him still. and 2) I wish the final fight was a little bigger between the accended beings but it was to the point.

I can't see any fan of the show not really liking this movie. A must buy for fans and I hope there will be more SG1 movies in the future.",1205193600,3,645,3.992248062015504
3292327,4,B0010YSD7M,"I just reviewed The Ark of Truth and felt that they took one season and forced it into a 2 hour frame. I blame the scifi channel for that one. Over all the movie was excellent but I felt that in the beginning of the movie they could have dug a little deeper on the alteran/ori rift. The quick witted humor, and special effects were great, not to mention the cinematography too. The movie left a lot of open doors for future movies so that is a positive note. There was one thing that I expected in the movie and did not see it, I will not mention it because of the spoil potential. Over all I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars. I will say this, War and Peace can never be compressed into a readers digest book. Neither can this story. I recommend purchasing this movie instead of torrent site download, so we can look forward to more than just Continuum. Enjoy!! jim",1205107200,4,864,4.179640718562874
3292328,5,B0010YSD7M,"SG-1 is searching for an artifact that can supposedly defeat the Ori once and for all, when they are unexpectedly attacked by a group of Ori followers. Teaming up with an unexpected ally, SG-1 heads out on the Odyssey to track down the Ark of Truth. But when the Odyssey is sabotaged, SG-1 finds themselves under attack from two dangerous enemy forces.

Picking up where the end of season ten left off, Daniel (Michael Shanks), Sam (Amanda Tapping), Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Cam (Ben Browder), and Vala (Claudia Black) are all back and better than ever.  The main cast is just as fantastic as ever. And there are surprising guest stars that do a wonderful job of bringing in emotional connections.  The CGI and special effects of the action scenes and alien technology were as good as a big budget film. But then, Stargate has always excelled at producing high quality visual effects on a limited budget.

SG-1 ended on a high note, with a cast that had amazing chemistry. And as one who owns all ten seasons of SG-1, I have to say that the last season was my favorite.  With the same wonderful humor, action, and special effects, the Ark of Truth makes for a super-charged, thrilling continuation of the one of the greatest and longest running science fiction shows in American history.  From laughing aloud to edge-of-your-seat excitement, this is one movie no Stargate fan should miss.",1205107200,4,1391,4.799163179916318

If your a fan of the series this is a must buy for a few reasons! 1. its a good movie and although they cram a big story into it to give closure to the ori story arc, which could have (and should have) been another season or 3 movies!!!!! it does give you closure.... 2. The producers and mgm have slated a second movie to follow this one dealing with a different storyline and have alluded to more possible movies in the future so the better the sales of this dvd the more chance we have on new and expanding stories in the sg1 universe!",1205020800,4,833,4.085365853658536

Hopefully, without giving anything away, it was a good story.  Satisfying closure? to the Ori thread, IOA back making things harder for the SG-1, and somewhat corny at the end, but I liked it.

On a sidenote, I enjoyed the extras, ie. the SD Comic Con highlights were funny...",1205020800,6,429,4.195121951219512
3292331,4,B0010YSD7M,"I bought the DVD today from my retailer a week before the release date, and watched it once I got home.

The film is set between series 3 and 4 of Atlantis as a few changes occur in series 4 of Atlantis which aren't in this movie.

I would recommend anyone to watch the prologue as a refresher of the ori story (fan or not). The film was a great continuation of ""unending"" it's as if it wasn't cancelled.  The final ori story did seem a little rushed as questions which were left unanswered in series 10 were answered quite quickly. The overall story was a typically great SG1 episode but could have easily been pushed into an entire series, plus the resurrection of the replicators was a good and surprising touch.  Although they go to the ori galaxy not a lot is shown and doesn't seem different from the other two know galaxies in the Stargate universe.

Overall it was a great movie with just a few minor issues, but nothing to worry about and for fans a great return to one of the best sci-fi shows ever, can't wait for the next movie with the return of Jack O'Neil.",1204588800,5,1071,4.308457711442786

I realize many of you haven't had the opportunity to see this yet since it won't come out until March. But let me say I don't think you'll be too disappointed. It makes me want to buy the whole series and start from the beginning again.

Some reviews are saying it is lame and others are saying that is is the ""best thing since sliced bread."" So you can imagine, but I am going to view it with an open mind and I am really looking forward to seeing what they did with their significanly higher budget. But at least we can be thankful that their are movies to follow to help wrap up specific hanging storylines. I also attended the Stargate Convention in LA recently and Cliff Simon (Ba'al) said that there are already two more movies planned after Arc of Truth and Continuum. Because apparently Continuum leaves a gap at the end?? So who knows if that will happen, right, but wouldn't it be brilliant to enjoy two more Stargate films???

3292337,2,B0010YSD7M,"As with many others, I had opportunity to view a screener of the video. It has some fairly impressive scenes in it and there was obvious extra budget beyond the normal episode. That said, as a movie, the video was fairly disappointing--it should have been cast as a four episode story arc minimum with extra details to fill in what turned out to be a fairly rushed, plot-obvious film.

The directors/writers crammed too much into the film. Expectations found on many sites for how the Ori story arc would end are spot on in almost every instance. The return of an old, previously defeated enemy in the middle of the film was creative but had little build up. This secondary plot, however, had greater depth and build up than the main plot.

The main plot, dealing with the end of the Ori, was resolved in a classic Deus ex Machina form--something I thought had been decried since the Greeks first developed it. Beyond just being classic, elements at the end of the main storyline echoed the end of Anubis in the tv series with only differing visual effects.

While much of the above is negative, it was a fun, if obvious story, with very impressive visual effects. The video clips of mountains were among my favorite and deserve a place in any documentary of the real earth location. The space battles were also visually impressive, as was the depiction of the ""Fields of Celestis"" and the incarnation of the remaining Ori.

The Goa'uld story line alone lasted for 8 years, then the Ori became the next ultimate threat, A LOT more could have been done carry on the show.  Why didn't MGM just move the show to another network?
