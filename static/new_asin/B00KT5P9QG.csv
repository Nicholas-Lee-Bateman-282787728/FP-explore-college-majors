6445255,5,B00KT5P9QG,"As a teacher I'm always looking for safe, effective and fun DVD's to recommend to clients. This teacher gives clear instructions that go with the examples pictured. It targets the areas we all need an extra bit of TLC but still gives a well rounded practice. I also like the option of picking a short spotlight workout or playing the whole sequence. The teacher uses simple and encouraging language throughout without being condescending.  I highly recommend this DVD for all levels.",1417564800,15,483,4.962962962962963
6445256,5,B00KT5P9QG,Once again I am thrilled with Chris's  DVD. It's has just enough of a tough work out that you know it's going to work. Her easy instructions and funny comments make it a wonderful work out.,1413331200,,189,4.25
6445257,3,B00KT5P9QG,"Im not a huge yoga person but this isca good workout you will feel, level og difficulty not to bad. Perfect for those wanting to incirporate yoga into their workout regimen.",1412985600,,173,4.612903225806452
6445258,5,B00KT5P9QG,"Chrissy Carters DVD is great for those new to yoga or those trying to get back into shape, like myself.  Ive done yoga and pilates for several years, but was still challenged by this DVD's workout. Plus, Chrissy gives great options for different skill levels. My personal favorite is the abdominal series. Ive been lucky enough to take class with Chrissy in NYC and I really love how I can take her teaching with me when I travel and share it with friends across the country. Her teaching is as authentic and well-thought-out in class as in this DVD. I highly recommend it.",1412208000,11,573,4.563106796116505
6445259,4,B00KT5P9QG,"Slow pace, good for people new to yoga, as well as people looking for a way to tone. Feel it the next day, instructor has a pleasant personality, goes into correct yoga alignment.  Only complaint is you can only play one segment at a time, not adjust the play, for what you want to do.",1411948800,2,285,4.181818181818182
6445260,5,B00KT5P9QG,"Chrissy is a very pleasant instructor with a clear and soothing voice.  The music is relaxing and the outdoor terrace with beach view setting is great.  The workout is chaptered and excellent.  She is clear and precise in her instruction.  Highly recommended.  I also own her other DVD 'Beginning Yoga', which is also fantastic and set next to a lovely swimming pool.",1411516800,6,367,4.854838709677419
6445261,3,B00KT5P9QG,"Not for beginners.  Maybe, I can use it later.",1488412800,,46,4.111111111111111
6445262,3,B00KT5P9QG,"I really wanted to like this, and there are good things about it, but it's not my favorite or my go-to for a yoga dvd. I found the belly segment to be effective yet difficult to execute due to the amount of time spent in bare-footed blanks. I'm not used to having to hold my planks in bare-feet for so long and it kind of aggravated my toes/feet. I really like the scenery and the way the narrator speaks. She is down-to-earth and very instructive, and the background is very tranquil. Bottom line: if you want a more modern fusion of pilates and yoga and can handle a fairly vigorous routine filled with bare-footed planks, then this might be for you. I'm sure it's very effective when done on a regular basis, but it just wasn't the right dvd to help me get back on track after having a baby.",1488153600,,794,4.3

6445267,5,B00KT5P9QG,"Love, love, love this DVD! I am recovering from a total hip replacement and wanted to pick up some yoga to improve my flexibility and add a low-impact option to my workouts. I tried several, and this is by far the best. Her instructions are clear and the workout is really good. Not only is my hip feeling better and better, but I am seeing results in my muscle tone and the way my clothes fit. By the way, this should be titled ""Yoga for Your Entire Body."" I actually love this for the arm workout, which isn't even listed as one of the benefits. Be sure to really listen to her instructions about weight shift and position, and you will be able to challenge yourself. Also, Chrissy Carter is pleasant and straightforward with the workout--no yoga self-fulfilliment stuff or working on your energy, etc., which drives me crazy in some yoga videos. I really like her straightforward, pleasant style.",1470960000,2,899,4.625

6445269,3,B00KT5P9QG,"I am giving this three stars becuase i am sure it will do the trick.  However, it was way to boaring for me. I wanted to hit the lady narrator, perhaps I need more yoga..",1462752000,2,170,3.857142857142857

6445272,5,B00KT5P9QG,Great workout. Options to choose 20min workout for each problem area although the workouts kind of address all problems anyway. Easy enough for a beginner with good modifications. She gives great instruction.,1452902400,,208,5.53125
6445273,4,B00KT5P9QG,This is a great workout!  I wasn't expecting it to be such a great workout. I have been practicing yoga for four years now and I will not lie this dvd is challenging to me!,1452643200,,172,3.914285714285714
6445274,2,B00KT5P9QG,"I have been doing Yoga for a while, however, I am not a flexible person, I will never be a flexible person. I did not like the fact that it was not a program, just switching from one pose to another and quiet fast. Some positions were too difficult for me and it upset me. It is more a DVD for people who are very flexible and pros in Yoga.",1449100800,,340,3.8714285714285714

6445278,5,B00KT5P9QG,"My attraction to this DVD was my desire to strengthen my core so that I'd be able to progress to more advanced postures, especially inversions. But because of the clear/detailed instructions Chrissy provided throughout the DVD, I was able to fine-tune my ability to do all of the postures she presented -- in addition to strengthening my abs. It's a great DVD for strengthening and sculpting, as well as for learning the proper alignment for many basic postures.",1437868800,3,462,4.935897435897436

6445280,3,B00KT5P9QG,I really like this workout. the 20 minutes is fantastic because I can work out while my kids nap and still get stuff done! the only thing is its a lot of toning and muscle work and not much breathing and relaxing,1434067200,5,212,4.071428571428571

6445284,5,B00KT5P9QG,"Whether you are a beginner and looking for tools to get started with a home practice, or a more advanced practitioner hoping to refine some of your skills and movements - you will enjoy these sequences. Chrissy is encouraging and offers clear instructions that are easy to follow. So many yoga dvd's are paced too quickly or slowly but I find this one to be JUST RIGHT.  I have Chrissy's other DVD as well  ( Beginning Yoga with Chrissy Carter) which is equally fantastic, and I can't wait for more offerings from this very gifted teacher!",1425427200,2,539,4.604166666666667

8661219,4,B00KT5P9QG,"Nice DVD, it's just not for beginners. I think she goes too fast with instructions. Or maybe I'm just too slow in my old age. :-) Will still work on it, I'm sure I'll get better over time.

8661228,2,B00KT5P9QG,"I suppose if you are really new to yoga, and not used to a lot of physical activity, this dvd would be a great starting point for you.
If you are on your mat more than once a week, you will find this dvd to be extremely basic and not challenging at all.
I didn't feel any heat building through my body, even durong the core portion of it. It's not bad, just geared toward very early practitioners.",1488672000,3,397,4.102564102564102
