8644239,4,B00IORRBN0,"This is a Hammer film in all but the name. How this came to being is told in a lengthy special Shadow Play: inside the shadow of the cat.

You may find the actors a tad exaggerating in their acting; I do not know if this is on purpose or just corny dialog and acting.

----------------------------

Ella Venable (Catherine Lacey) is old and rich. Naturally she lives in an Old Dark House. Her hubby (Andr Morell) married her for her money and cannot wait any longer. He encourages the butler (Andrew Crawford) to dispatch Ella with extreme prejudice. Naturally this is witnessed by her cute cat, Tabitha (uncredited.)

Now for the psychological thriller. All the guilty parties are paranoid that the cat know something and will tell or maybe has something more diabolical in mind. Is the cat really that cunning or are they about to do their own selves in?",1526169600,,856,4.6490066225165565

8644242,5,B00IORRBN0,"While spending a typical evening in, reading Edgar Allen Poe's THE RAVEN to her cat, poor Ella Venable (Catherine Lacey) is brutally murdered. With the cat as the only witness to the dastardly deed, the miscreants- Walter Venable (Andre Morell- PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES), Clara the maid (Freda Jackson- THE BRIDES OF DRACULA), and Andrew the butler (Andrew Crawford), believe they've committed the perrrrfect crime, having bumped off Ella and buried her in the backyard of the mansion. Not so fast! It seems that kitty has a few tricks up her fuzzy sleeves, resulting in mayhem for the three cantankerous conspirators! Enter Elizabeth (Barbara Shelley- VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, THE GORGON), the niece, who's so nice, she makes Pollyanna look like THE OMEN's Mrs. Baylock! Also, Inspector Rowles is on the case, snooping for clues. As other odious relatives arrive, it's uncertain if anyone will survive this felonious feline. THE SHADOW OF THE CAT is quite an enjoyable ball of yarn, full of hilarity as we watch grown humans reduced to jelly, at the paws of the titular tabby! The cat's POV shots are especially groovy! Highly recommended...",1483747200,2,1137,5.053191489361702
8644243,4,B00IORRBN0,"If you like cats and Hammer films, you will be in feline heaven! This film has flown under the radar for years, as it doesn't mention HAMMER in the credits for contractual reasons. We may be over-selling it --as it is not scary at all --but it's a fun romp through HAMMER territory with HAMMER regulars Andr Morell and Barbara Shelley and a short-legged, but tenacious kitty who leaves no stone unturned in wreaking revenge on her mistress' murderers!",1481760000,3,451,4.7215189873417724
8644244,5,B00IORRBN0,"Very good early 60's British horror (more of a thriller) film.  A greedy man and his reprehensible servants kill the man's wealthy wife for the inheritance.  The only witness to the crime is the lady's cat, who in her natural cat fashion starts to torment the killers with fear and a sort of unguilty guilt.  The woman's niece (the true heiress) comes to care for her uncle, not knowing of the crime.  The man's greedy relatives arrive to help hunt and kill the tormenting cat, who really leads everyone a merry dance.  Unfortunately this film is not available in the USA in Region 1 format.  Hopefully a re-mastered high quality version will be released very soon.  Highly recommended.",1448409600,2,686,4.762711864406779
8644245,5,B00IORRBN0,I just saw this movie on Svengoolie.  It was hysterically funny!  Just about all the characters were terrified of the only witness to their wrongdoing - a cat.  I was cheering her on as she got revenge for the murder of her mistress!,1437868800,5,233,4.372093023255814
8644246,2,B00IORRBN0,"The Shadow of the Cat, 1961 film

There are two others involved. The body is placed in a shallow grave. What about her cat? The next morning a police inspector arrives to investigate her absence. The family wants the news kept out of the press. The cat knows. Walter, the older man, explores the attic. Andy hunts the cat, which runs into the cellar to hide. The emotion affects the older man, a doctor is called. That newspaper reporter was a friend of Ella and hopes to solve the mystery. Miss Elizabeth, the favorite niece, arrives. She is promised whats rightfully yours is she stays to nurse her uncle. Tabby likes her.

Clara plans to dispose of the cat. But this man cant do it. Michael arrives with the police inspector, who suspects foul play, they will search the countryside. Walter becomes emotional when he hears a cat. More visitors arrive the next morning. Afraid of a cat? Walter tells them about a will, they must find it and destroy it! [Does a string pull the cat on cue?] Michael offers help to Elizabeth. Does the cat know something about Ellas disappearance? Does their fear of the cat show a guilty conscience? Can they trap the cat in a cage? Elizabeth hears a noise from the chandelier over her bed. The caught cat goes into the bag. But it gets out of the bag. His pursuer, Andy, falls into the swamp and sinks out of sight! [Poetic justice.] Clara sees paw prints in the kitchen.

Why does that cat have to be destroyed? Clara don't leave me! says Walter. She goes down the stairs! It was the cat screams a woman! Who will be next? Jacob wants to make a deal over the money. Did the cat frighten Aunt Clara? Elizabeth tells Michael about that noise from the ceiling. The conspirators discuss the situation. The cat enters Walters bedroom. Was it a heart attack? Only one man will inherit everything now. What if there is a original will? Is it hidden in the house? The body of Andrew was found by the police. Jacob chases the cat onto the rooftop, then falls to the ground! Were the guilty punished? Will the good guys be rewarded? Will there be a happy ending?

This is an about average murder mystery that is complicated by the presence of a cat who acts like an avenging spirit. It is an interesting concept, but seems incredible at times. A shallow grave? Animals can dig it up, crows would be attracted to its presence. A search would locate it. Those who benefit from a murder become the prime suspects (or persons of interest). This is interesting for its early 20th century setting. Some parts echo The Hound of the Baskervilles, murders done for inheritance in an isolated swampy area.",1437264000,4,2812,4.507843137254902
