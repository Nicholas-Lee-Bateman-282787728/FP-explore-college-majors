The Lerner family was very large and known in the diamond business...When Hitler was advancing throughout Europe, the Jews had to keep one step ahead of the German military....and this is the recorded story of the family and how they did that. Any person with compassion for the victims would be impressed with the attitude and The strength of the members of this family. They were not great complainers...they just did what was necessary to survive and then to be a success wherever they stopped... They were a family that stuck together and helped each other in every way they possibly could.  they have my admiration. I am sure that there were a lot of details that were not here, but this program describes the situation very well.",1467849600,,790,4.72463768115942
