Glyndebourne then adds it's usual high  performance and production values.  But the most remarkable element of this  production is the deeply affecting performance of beautiful American  soprano Renee Fleming in the role of Countess Almaviva.  Her looks and  acting are stunning enough, but then she opens her mouth and sings in a  vioce for making flesh melt.  What a singer!  What a WOMAN!",948931200,,565,5.032608695652174

The Marriage of Figaro was said to be one of the best, so I asked my cousin who was a Music Major in college, about the singers in this production.

I bought this Bluray thinking it would be an upgrading of the NVC ARTS DVD I bought in 2003 at the UK Amazon Store. The screen format has not changed; it is the same 4:3 aspect ratio, and the video quality looks nice as long as you don't try to expand it to 16:9 in your TV.  I must recognize that the sound quality has improved.  The Bluray has only a LPCM option, but it that sounds better than the Dolby Digital 5.1 in the original DVD. However, in these days when most people have wide screen television sets its hard to accept that you must keep old 4:3 aspect ratio in order to have a decent video quality.

In what concerns the 1994 Glyndebourne performance, it was really a cast dream: Rene Fleming as the Countess, Alison Hagley as Sussana and Gerald Finley as Figaro. Maybe there has never been a better cast with the exception of the 1998 Met performance when Rene Fleming was accompanied by Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel, but you must be suscribed to the Met video on demand service in order to be able to watch it.

Alison Hagley is the Sussana Perfetta as many commentators say. However, in the 1993 Chatelet performance with Bryn Terfel and Ronalf Gilfry as Figaro and the Count, respectively, she looks much playful, brighter  and fresher. I cant say if it is Gardiners musical direction or her companions that took the best of her.  Unfortunately, the video quality of the  Chatelet production is poorer and Hillevi Martinpelto, who plays the Countess, has not the refinement and perfection of Rene Fleming.",1441584000,2,1845,5.029508196721311

With sensible camera work and fine orchestral playing the whole experience is completed by the art, stage, costumes, make-up all add up to this Le nozze di Figaro a very worthwhile buy.

1043870,5,6305458405,"This is the first opera I ever bought when it came out on VHS.I  bought it on DVD and now on Blu-Ray. It has a great Susanna in Alison Hagley and Figaro in Gerald Findley. They both mesh together so good. Renee Fleming as the Countess is excellent. I really have no problems like some others have with this production. I own many Le Nozze Di Figaro and each one should be judged on their own merit,not against others. Some may be better than others ,however this one belongs in everyones collection. It is well worth the 5 stars. This opera and Amadeus led me to a great appreciation in classical music. It started me on a journey to owning a huge CD and DVD collection of music. It had a huge effect on my life. Renee Fleming born in Indiana,Pa. only 60 miles from where I live has gone on to be a huge star in opera. I appreciate her dedication and sacrifice for her art and our pleasure. Go to youtube and see her rendition of Amazing Grace at ground zero. It will show you the humility of someone blessed in life with so much. I really wish I could meet her someday and thank her for leading me on to a happy filled life in classical music. This opera started me on a great journey. Thanks Renee!!! I hope your career continues for a long time.",1393632000,,1248,4.2217573221757325

I watched this with some more experienced opera-listeners and some thought the costumes, set design, and even the facial expressions of some of the characters were overdone, but I found the entire production extremely enjoyable.  The Countess (Renee Fleming?) turns in a spectacular performance.",1382832000,,386,5.311475409836065
1043873,4,6305458405,"Alison Hagley was by far the most enjoyable Susanna I have ever seen. Selfishly, I wish she had stayed in the business and had a prolific career so she could continue to be enhancing my life with hours of delectation. I hope whatever she moved on to after opera has given her deep pleasure. I give her eight stars.

I found the lighting design for this production verrrry annoying and counterproductive. Most of the set seemed to be in shadow and gloomy most of the time. Even when the cast came out at the end to take their bows, they were lit in blue -- the house lights were up for the audience; I remember thinking then it's quite strange and depressing that the audience is better lit than the cast. This is suppose to be a poignant but CHEERFUL comedy; so the only scene I expect to be dimly lit is the last one while the characters are all searching for one another in the woods. Light has tremendous impact on an audience's mood and this lighting seems to always want to drag you down into melancholy. So, to the director, Stephen Medcalf, and the Lighting Designer, Pat Collins, I --sadly-- give zero stars.

I would have stopped watching it if the cast and orchestra hadn't been so good. Congratulations to them and the conductor, Bernard Haitink.",1379808000,3,1257,4.508771929824562
1043916,1,6305458405,"WORST sound and video quality Blu Ray I have EVER owned! Even for DVD standard, this is pretty BAD!

The stages reminds me of some school musical, and singers are not at all good, although not terrible either.

But the biggest problem of this Bluray is the quality of video and audio. Why customers buy Bluray while paying extra $$$? It is, for better video and audio. This Bluray just defies this logic.

It says on the front cover that it was remastered from the original master tape, which is barely legible (on purpose?) in the Amazon picture, so I took some pictures and uploaded them. Even the title says (2013), and there is no mention of 1994 TV production date anywhere in the description! So when I clicked ""Add to Cart"" button, I thought I was buying 2013 production!

As the website description of High-definition video is completely false, (this is standard definition, in a bluray disc!) I am returning this for a full refund. I am hoping to get all of my money back.

1043917,2,6305458405,"I can't believe the positive reviews of this DVD refer to the product I purchased. The sound quality is so poor that in places the libretto is almost unintelligible, as if the opera was recorded illegally. I can't even comment on the quality of the singing because it is so muffled. The set is uninspired and the costumes look like they were done for a high school production. I think it's fair to say there is no nuance or creativity in the visual aspect of this production. I bought this DVD after reading through the reviews of several productions and deciding this one might be the best. I'm teaching this opera soon, but will have to continue looking for at least a passable version of it. I don't want to show this to students who are not familiar with the art form as it may dampen their enthusiasm.

Edit: I ended up ordering The Royal Opera's version with Erwin Schrott, Miah Persson, and Gerald Finlay and am very happy with it.",1359763200,3,938,4.485380116959064

1043920,1,6305458405,"I was thinking of buying this DVD (2003 version) but was able to borrow a copy from the library to test it out first. I was disappointed with the sound. Most of the time, the orchestra overwhelmed the soloists. This performance was originally broadcast in 1994 on English televison and was made for the old style TVs (4:3). This DVD did not do justice to Gerald Finley's wonderful voice. I also found the sets too modern looking and skimpy.

Update on May 3, 2013. I was hoping to find a review of the Blu-Ray version recently released but all of the reviews relate to earlier releases. Is the sound quality any better than on the earlier DVD version of this performance (2003) or does the orchestra still drown out the soloists? Amazon's policy of mixing the reviews of different versions of an opera is very UNHELPFUL.

Update on June 18, 2013. I was hoping that the Blu Ray version would have cleaned up the terrible sound quality on the DVD. But according to Goldberg's review of May 4, 2013, this is not the case. I won't be buying this Blu Ray.

Once again, I would suggest that Amazon segregate reviews of different versions of the same opera.",1353456000,8,1150,4.545893719806763
1043921,5,6305458405,"There has been a lot of talk of how attractive Opera Singers are today and its true . Singers in this performance (1994) are even more attractive . Allison Hagley who plays Susanna reminds me  of Jane Powell , but sings better. Unfortunately she does not seem to have had a long career. Also this is a tradtional production. No Chi-Chi. And the Conductor , Bernard Haitnick who seems very sympathique keeps things moving right along. Mozart would have enjoyed this DVD.",1344211200,2,469,4.719512195121951
1043922,3,6305458405,"This is (or rather, could be) the best Figaro I have seen on video.  Haitink's control and tempi are superb, the principals could not be bettered (Hagley a revelation, sad that she left the stage so soon) but alas, alas, how could they have passed the terrible imbalance in sound engineering?  As one reviewer remarked, no way could Haitink have drowned the singers as the recorded sound does, at all too many moments- particularly during the ensembles.
An utter disgrace for the production company, and a betrayal of all the brilliant musicians involved.",1338681600,,555,4.956989247311828
1043923,5,6305458405,"Yes it's in black and white and the sound is not as good as you can get (although for the most part it is quite acceptable), but this production is full of fine music making and acting.

1043924,4,6305458405,"This one is as good as I've found on DVD.  One of Fleming's finer efforts .. which is very fine indeed.  Finley is a good Figaro and Alison Hagley is a perfect Susanna with a voice you'll want to hear a lot more of.  Todorovitch was a mistake, so was putting Fleming in an ankle length dress when she'd packed on that extra thirty pounds.",1329609600,,338,4.1692307692307695
1043925,5,6305458405,"These performers have some of the most unabtrusive and refined voices I've heard in a long time.  Hagley's voice as Susanna stold the show.  While the acting may take 2nd place to the singing, that is perfectly fine with me.  The orchestra was a bit louder than usual for an Opera, but you know what?  The compositions that make up Le Nozze de Figaro are so beautiful that, to me it was icing on the cake.

The set was not changed often, but with the filmography, it didn't need to.  It was proper for the timeframe of the opera and visually pleasing.  This was not a bland nor boring opera.

Le Nozze de Figaro is a long opera, weighing in at around 2.5 hours.  This is one of the few I had no problems getting a bit ansi with the story and length.  Look, if you have an ear for beauty, then the beauty of this performance will bring tears to your eyes.  The performers and Orchestra hit so many sweet notes.

Now my favorite particular production of the dozens I own.  I am very picky and get bored easy, so that should tell you something.",1325980800,,1041,4.25
1043958,5,6305458405,"This is a truly wonderful production of one of the great operatic comedies - strongly cast, well conducted, and interestingly staged.
Susanna is one of Mozart's greatest roles, and Alison Hagley does full justice to it. She creates a character that is intelligent, resourceful, and spunky. She also sings beautifully; ""Deh vieni non tardar"" is worth waiting three hours to hear. She has excellent chemistry with the well sung Figaro of Gerald Finley. He is likewise smart and resourceful, and he delights in outsmarting his master. Rene Fleming is a lovely Countess. She creates interesting vocal colors and dynamic shadings, especially in her arias, and she blends splendidly with Hagley in the Letter Duet. She had more of an ""opera singer's figure"" in 1994, but she still moves gracefully, and she finds a good balance between regal and girlish. Andreas Schmidt is a choleric, dangerous Count, but his repentance at the end is entirely convincing. As usual, he sings beautifully, with a good understanding of the words. The smaller parts are also well cast. Marie-Ange Todorovich is an excellent hormone-soaked Cherubino. Robert Tear sings Basilio as well as he did in the classic Davis recording twenty years earlier, and he creates a delightful character. Conductor Bernard Haitink is in full command of the score. His tempos are brisk, but he knows when to take time for expression, and he allows the singers some stylish bits of embellishment. The performance is uncut and includes the often omitted arias for Basilio and Marcellina; Tear and Wendy Hillhouse handle them with aplomb. The staging is an effective blend of beautiful period costumes and modern stylized settings.
Several reviewers have complained about the sound, in that the voices sometimes sound distant or muffled. Having listened to the recording on headphones, I think this is clearly the result of microphone placement; one can hear the singers go in and out of focus as they move around the stage. This was, after all, the first production in Glyndebourne's new house, and perhaps the engineers were not quite used to the acoustics yet. This could also explain the numerous moments when the singers are not quite in sync with the orchestra; perhaps they could not hear well. But these are minor distractions in an otherwise excellent performance. Strongly recommended.",1310947200,2,2347,5.146596858638744
1043959,5,6305458405,"I'm not sure how many times I've watched this DVD, but it's been many since my purchase.  What originally drew me to it was the fact that Renee Fleming was in it.  She is certainly very strong, but I greatly enjoyed all the performances.

The orchestra and sets are very enjoyable as the singers simply carry you away.  I didn't care too much for the candy stripes on the stage floor, but found that to be no more than a mild irritant that can be quickly forgotten.

I can't speak to the audio issues others have mentioned, as I watched the DVD on a small CRT set with one tiny speaker. One thing that bugs the heck out of me, though, is the subtitling. Whoever did it is either lazy or cheap, because fully half the opera is NOT subtitled. When an aria starts, it's there. But as material repeats, it's not. Much of the back and forth in recitatives is not there. You can follow the progress of the libretto roughly, but not in detail. That's why 3 instead of 4 stars.",1282003200,3,609,4.446428571428571

I am still searching for an adequate videotaped FIGARO.  I suspect that when one emerges, it will star Tito Gobbi as the Count.

UPDATE: An adequate videotaped FIGARO is now available, starring Geraint Evans, Graziella Sciutti, Hilde Gueden, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and Evelyn Lear.  I have reviewed it, see my other revivews.  Also, Tito Gobbi's Count is availble on CD/MP3 from operadepot.com.

Countess Rosina is Almaviva's wife but ignorant of the fact that her husband is trying to use the ancient regime credo - the right of the seigneur. (Primae noctis).The Count is looking for amorous advances towards Susanna, the Countess maid and head chambermaid, before the consummation of her marriage to Figaro.

Susanna is to be betrothed to Figaro, the man she loves and to whom she is engaged. Figaro is the count's chief steward and the concierge of his castle.

Count Almaviva discovers that his young attendant, Cherubino, is interested in the Countess. (Actually he was in the love with every woman). So, the Count decides to send Cherubino away as a private in his own regiment.

Suzanna reveals everything o Figaro and the Countess
Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess concoct a plot to abash Count Almaviva and disclose his unfaithfulness, forcing the count to look ridiculous and extravagantly farce.

In the meantime Figaro is caught up in a disagreement with doctor Bartholo and Marceline (another housekeeper - in love with Figaro, inadvertently Figaro's mother) which ends up when he is disclosed to be their son.

At night, all find themselves in the palace, where a funny series of cases of mistaken identity results in the Count's disgrace and then pardoned by the Countess.
Figaro and Suzanna get married.

In 1786, Mozart set to music this Italian Libretto (often called: The Day of Madness). The opera is comic - buffa, and the libretto is written by Lorenzo da Ponte (I believe in 1784)

Perhaps what's funnier is that this masterpiece was banned in Vienna because it has satirical notions against the aristocracy. Indications of a French revolution were beginning to surface and came two years after Figaro (The fall of the Bastille; march to Versailles, French king and assembly returned to Paris, national guard formed in Paris under Lafayette, rising in French provinces..........)

This recording is lovely.
It covers, live; a wide range of music and songs.

There is cracking charm in using motley of assortments of different performances. Karl Bohm, a Mozarist to the bone, has given the opera Music for Life.
This is one of different interpretations that I am happy to own .......... For life",1208131200,12,2292,5.010526315789473

1044034,5,6305458405,"I really enjoyed this version of ""Le Nozze Di Figaro"". The cast is superb and all wonderful actors. Alison Hagley and Gerald Finley are excellent as Susanna and Figaro. The divine Renee Fleming shines as the Countess with her dramatic ability and that creamy voice. Check out the look she gives to the Count when he sings asking for her forgiveness in the bedroom scene. Schmidt is outstanding as the Count, but is such a rogue that one does not feel sorry for his ultimate humiliation. For comedic relief, the wonderful singer Rodorovitch is superb as Cherubino. I laughed my head off at the bedroom scene where Cherubino has been dressed in women's clothes and heels by Susanna and Countess. They are trying to teach Cherubino to walk like a lady. At one point, it seems like Renee is really laughing and not acting. The sound quality and film production are outstanding. I heard nothing wrong on the audio end so have no idea what a couple of prior reviewers are complaining about in regards to bad audio mix. Highly recommended.",1175299200,7,1032,4.707182320441989
1044035,4,6305458405,"I love this production at Glyndebourne.  It is a top-tier cast, and great orchestra in a wonderfully traditional staging.  It's the sound quality that knocks this production down to 4 stars.  Singers fade in and out, footsteps are very loud, and the recitatives sometimes get lost.  Rest assured though, this DVD is still worthwhile and deserves a place on your shelf.

Renee Fleming is brilliant as the Countess.  This was her breakthrough role at the HGO.  It is the role that propelled her to stardom, and few can sing it as well as she can. Her two big arias, ""Dove sono"" and ""Porgi amor"" will bring tears to your eyes.  Alison Hagley is a fabulous Susanna.  Her voice is just the right weight; light enough for the character, but with enough substance to balance Renee beautifully.  Their duet ""Sull'aria"" is sublime.  Alison is quite pretty, in a very accessible way.  In other words, she is a perfect Susanna.  Susanna's beau Figaro, was cast very well by utilizing Gerald Finley.  He looks and sounds the part.  Andreas Schmidt is a fantastic Count.  His weighty voice fits the role perfectly.  His scenes with Renee were great, both musically and dramatically.  Then there is the famous role of Cherubino, a trouser role that all serious mezzos eventually do.  This being opera buffa style, there is a huge temptation to play Cherubino over the top.  Not so with Marie-Ange Todorovitch.  She looked the part of a teenage boy, and was quite a convincing skirt-chaser.  She has a nice, unpretentious mezzo instrument reminiscent of another famous Cherubino, the great Frederica Von Stade.  Her ""Voi che sapete"" was very well done.

Try to ignore the sound shortcomings in this DVD and enjoy this straightforward, well-sung, and no-frills production of Figaro.  Kudos to the cast, Maestro Haitink, the Orchestra, and the Glyndbourne Festival for this nice production.

Highly recommended.",1168300800,9,1894,4.990384615384615
1044036,5,6305458405,"Of all the Operas on DVD that I have purchased this is my favorite.  This whole performance and production come together in a special way.

  The singing and acting are of the highest order.  The playing from LSO under Bernard Haitink is perfectly judged and paced, providing wonderful support to the singers.

  The staging supports the story well and it was beautifully filmed.  The audio is well above average for opera DVDs.  The balance between voice and orchestra is excellent.  The recording could benefit from a little more ambiance, but there is nothing highly irritating in the recording to detract from the performance.

  This DVD would make converts of many, to using this medium to present great opera in the home.",1167696000,5,728,4.909090909090909
1044080,1,6305458405,"I wish I had credited Mr Schenbeck's review more highly. There is no PCM layer, so there is no hifi sound. To make matters worse, the balancing is extremely artificial (e.g. Count on right channel only when he standing 3 feet to the right of Countess who is on left channel only). The time is 190 minutes (!), 17 minutes more than Boehm's complete account on DG 1968--and no one I know has accused Boehm of being a speed freak. The sets are strictly Walmart. The acting is quite good given that the pace set by Haitink essentially eliminates any comedy. The singing also seems quite good, but this is impossible to judge given the Dolby sound.",1166745600,12,643,4.504273504273504
1044081,5,6305458405,"I can't say enough about this production.  The casting and interpretation were just about as close to perfect as my mind's eye could have imagined.  Not only do the cast members have beautiful, clear voices, but they can actually act!  Facial expressions reacting to the text being sung in the ensembles and recitatives and the action onstage show that each actor knows exactly what his/her character ought to be thinking, and body language supports this.  (The scene where we discover the secret of Figaro's parents is played to perfection, and the classic Act II finale has exactly the right give-and-take of emotions to make each change of musical scenery flow into the next.)

Andreas Schmidt's Count Almaviva is a superb Mozart villain; he is able to show the hypocritical nature of the Count's behavior while giving the audience a glimmer of the passion and potential for reform.  He is able to project that something (whatever it was) that made the Countess love him once upon a time, and makes her arias hoping for the return of his love all the more poignant.  Now indifferent to his spouse and habitually unfaithful--trifling with his servant women--he somehow manages to blush when caught in act while displaying (hypocritical) riteous indignance when he believes his wife is cheating on him.  He jealously sneers at his upstart servant Figaro while chasing after his fiancee, and revels in playing this fabulous ""bad guy"" role with vigor and relish.

Renee Fleming's voice is, as always, heavenly.  As the conflicted and long-suffering Countess, she plays the ever-depressed optimist with a mix of sweetness and pathos that transforms her from merely a beautiful singer into a great musical actress.

Gerald Finley and Alison Hagley are absolutely charming as the soon-to-be-married servant couple.  The chemistry between them makes the plot believable, and makes it believable that no matter what happens, they will be able to hold everything around them together.  From the opening scene, one falls in love with the young couple and is instantly on their side (they are, after all, in the right).  Hagley's Susanna projects a character thoughtful and circumspect enough to make up for the clowning posture (which is just as it should be) of Figaro.

The supporting cast is likewise wonderful, from the pompous and vindictive Bartolo to the aging Marcellina, relentless in her quest to make Figaro marry her.  The loose morals of Basilio and the bustle of the gardener Antonio (a bit part, granted, but played with comic charm).  And Agne-Marie Todorovich's Cherubino steals the stage, projecting just the right mixture of puckish charm and teenage hormones.

Minimalist sets (albeit still projecting a period flavor) and costumes make the perfect backdrop to the colorful characters it was made to hold, supporting the action rather than distracting attention from it.

Of course, the music is sublime.  I have spent the better part of two years now studying Italian-language opera of this period, and this is certainly ONE of, if not THE, best of the repertoire.  It is arguably Mozart's most beloved opera, and it is conducted and interpreted with such love and care that it shines here just as it ought.  (Thank you, Bernard Haitink!)

If you are considering getting a Mozart opera for your video library, THIS IS THE ONE!  I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",1158278400,23,3387,5.0612612612612615
1044082,5,6305458405,"Many things combine to make this an ideal production to enjoy in the home.  There are enough shots of the newly-enlarged opera house at Glyndebourne to remind us that we are at an actual performance.  The camera work, however, gets us closer than is possible in any theatre; indeed, during the Countess's first aria we are lying beside her in the bed.  Amongst the principals, it is Figaro (Gerald Finley) and  Susanna (Alison Begley)  who dominate, and rightly so.  With subtitles provided and every note of Mozart's score included, we might well conclude that this is the most entertaining of all operas.",1156723200,10,606,4.892156862745098
1044083,5,6305458405,"This Production of Le Nozze di Figaro is an Excellent one (probably among the top two I have ever seen.) The Tempi of Bernard Haitnik is the only problem I had with this production. He takes some things very fast and I like that but he also takes a lot of them very slowly. That is the only big problem I had with this DVD. Even with Mr. Haitink's weird tempi the orchestra plays wonderfully. Now to the singers! Gerald Finley's Figaro is a very menacing one but with his great singing he pulled off the role. Alison Hagley is the best looking Susanna I have ever seen. You can really tell why the Count lusts after her. Her singing is also very good. Renee Fleming is the best Countess I have ever seen (next to Kiri te Kanawa and Hillevi Martinpelto.) She commands her Aria's with stiff dignity and a wonderful voice. Her ""Dove sono"" is among the best. Andrea Schmidt's Count is the best I have ever seen . He is both menacing (to Figaro and Cherubino) and loving (to Susanna and the Countess-at the end.) His 3rd act aria is very lively and professionally sung. Marie-Ange Todorovitch is a rather lackluster Cherubino but pulls off the role none-the-less. Mandred Rhrl is a very comical Bartolo (to me he kind-of looks like Don Knotts.) His ""La vendetta"" isn't up to snuff but that can be forgiven. Wendy Hillhouse is among the best Marcellina's I have ever seen. She can be annoying as in ""Tutto ancor...Via resti servita"" and loving as in her extremely beautiful rendition of  ""Il capro e la capretta"". Robert Tear is the best Basilio I have ever seen. The rest of the cast is good especially the Curzio of John Graham-Hill and the Antonio of Donald Adams (who was the 1st Antonio I actually enjoyed seeing.) The Barbarina of Susan Gritton is acceptable but not the best. Overall excellent performance. Buy it for Fleming alone if you have to. You won't regret it :)",1155945600,9,1871,4.519174041297935
1044084,5,6305458405,"Before my review, I just want to respond to a comment made about Gerald Finley's ""too good-looking"" Figaro.  While Rosina is younger at age 19 or so (I agree that I would rather a young Rosina, but Renee Fleming is quite beautiful and I've seen much worse,) Figaro is 30 years old, which is still quite young.  In the source for the opera, the Beaumarchais play Le Mariage de Figaro, there are numerous remarks from the cast about how young and handsome he is.  So, really, Gerald Finley is more physically accurate of a Figaro than, say, Bryn Terfel.

Reading a synopsis of Le nozze di Figaro really intrigued me about the opera, so when I went to the library to pick up a DVD of Don Giovanni, which my voice teacher wanted me to listen to as I was going to be studying ""Batti, batti,"" I picked up this DVD as well (as well as recordings of those two operas.)  It was only when I was in the car that I saw ""Renee Fleming"" on the cover and let out a delighted shriek, which rather confused my poor mother.

I still remember that I watched it on a Friday night, and I stayed up until an ungodly hour just to finish it.  I also remember that I watched it again on Saturday, and pretty much 20 more times after that throughout the week.  I was absolutely hooked.  In fact, I ended up getting a fine from the library because it was late.  Not because I forgot, but because I didn't want to give it back!  I suffered for a week or two and then finally decided, ""Screw it, I'm buying it.""  I did so, and it is sitting on my shelf, right next to West Side Story, with all of my other beloved DVDs and videos.

My one regret is that I watched it before my Don Giovanni DVD: after this fantastic one, Don Giovanni (which was an older production of less quality and a rather lackluster cast) could not even compare!

Since that fateful day I watched this DVD, I have since become a gigantic Figaro nerd.  I've read the Beaumarchais trilogy countless times, seen the prequel Il barbiere di Siviglia performed live, collected pictures from it, listened to (and own) various recordings, watched this DVD about a thousand more times, seen clips of other productions of it, etc etc.  Heck, just yesterday I listened to the Met Opera Broadcast of it.  So I thought I would come back and objectively judge (to the best of my ability, anyway,) the DVD that started it all.

Sets and costumes - I have seen better sets and costumes, but these are fine.  I like how Rosina isn't dressed very glamorously: most productions fail to realize that she is supposed to be feeling unwell and thus not exactly sumptuously dressed.  Though I will admit that the wig is hideous.  Fortunately, it isn't on that long, and it makes Fleming look all the more gorgeous in scenes when she isn't wearing it.

Subtitles - I agree that the subtitles aren't the best, but if you read translations of Le nozze di Figaro librettos, these mistakes are also commonly made (someone pointed out the lack of showing Susanna's Freudian slips in ""Crudel! Perche finora""... I only found that included in one booklet of a recording I own) in more than just this DVD.

Sound quality - It's not the best, but it's passable.  I'm not a great judge of that, though, anyway.

Miscellaneous remark: Yeah, having Renee Fleming rolling around during ""Deh vieni"" was a bit odd, but, hey.

Cast (Yay, the fun part):

Gerald Finley - He is one of the Figaros I've seen who physically resembles the picture in my head.  His portrayal is rife with comedy, though also has an angry edge to it.  I'm not fond of that angry edge often found in Figaros in this opera (I think the character was considering it more of a game than a serious problem, until the whole thing with the pin) but he isn't so angry that it detracts much from his performance, and his interpretation remains one of my favorites that I've seen/heard in Figaros.  However, his angry edge is brought up amazingly in Atto Quarto: he is incredibly, incredibly, passionate and full of rage.  Of course, this disappears once he finds out that Susanna was just tricking him.  One of my favorite moments of his that I've never heard in any other Figaros is at the end when he says ""Perdono, perdono!"" in a very exaggerated manner, so you know he's just completely faking it and having utmost fun.  It's so like Figaro that it just makes me smile.  And, as others have said, Finley's chemistry with Hagley is just wonderful.

Alison Hagley - There are not enough superlatives in the English language for me to describe how much I love her.  First off, she is young and pretty (which I honestly think is a necessity for the role since several guys in the opera lust after her) and, thanks to her, I shall forever picture Susanna as blonde.  She handles the comedic bits with ease yet also maintains dignity and grace, not to mention the emotional sincerity and sweetness of the character.  She also maintains what many singers playing Susanna forget to: how shrewd and clever the character is.  Yet she also shows Susanna's spitfire side well, particularly in the Atto Terzo Sestetto and also the part of Atto Quarto where she thinks Figaro is going to cheat on her.  She has some of the most heartbreaking moments in the opera to me, like when she breaks down into tears after ""Deh vieni.""  And, I'm not sure if this was her move or the director's, but it's hilarious when during ""Pace, pace, mio dolce tesoro"" she hits Figaro when saying ""La voce?"" even after she knows he was playing around with her.  That's so like Susanna!  Another great moment of hers is during ""Crudel! Perche finora"" when she is truly hilarious as she acts all sexy and seductive.  She might be the reason that became my favorite duettino from the opera.

Renee Fleming - She is second thus far only to Veronique Gens for me.  She is lovely and constantly has an air of sadness to her, which makes her situation all the more tragic.  She and Susanna are really cute in their scenes when they're plotting together, and she also showed well, in an understated way (as Rosina would,) lust for Cherubino.  She also has moments of girlishness, in which we see glimpses of the Rosina of 3 years ago.  Her shining moments for me are ""Dove sono i bei momenti"" and the last scene of the opera, in which she forgives the Count.

Andreas Schmidt - Well, he's not my favorite Count (Simon Keenlyside!!!) but he does a good job.  He is more sympathetic from most, but not to the point where I would side with him or want him to be able to succeed in his plans.

Cherubino (sorry, don't know the name offhand) - While I think Cherubino was lacking the adolescent energy the character requires, this Cherubino had a gorgeous voice and even had chemistry with Renee Fleming.  Also, she really made me crack up during Atto Quarto when Cherubino tries to hit on Susanna in the garden.

Bartolo, Marcellina, and don Basilio - They were all quite good; what I liked was that Marcellina was actually physically believable as Figaro's mother.  Someone disliked her during her aria in an above review, but I liked it very much.

Barbarina - Okay, this is my one complaint, which is admittedly rather superficial, but this things tend to bother me: She didn't look at all like a pretty, 12-year-old girl.  She looked older than Susanna, for heaven's sake.  And I didn't find her very charming, either.  But, her voice was beautiful and she conveyed sorrow really well during her cavatina ""L'ho perduta... me meschina.""

So, there you have it.  All in all, a great Figaro to have on DVD.  Like I said, I owe it for introducing me to such a great opera.  So, if you want to fall in love with this opera like I did, I would recommend starting with this DVD.",1145750400,71,7699,4.498200143988481
1044085,4,6305458405,"This is an excellent Figaro DVD.  If you're looking for a first Figaro video, this would be an excellent choice: the production is straightforward (albeit standard) with a strong cast and fabulous orchestra.

It is also worth mentioning that it is a VERY complete recording, including even the Fourth Act arias of Figaro, Marcellina, and Don Basilio which are often cut.

Production:

The production is nothing special, but gets the job done is certainly strong enough to support the performances.  The staging is effective, and often very funny (though never hilarious).

Singing:

The singing on this DVD is wonderful!  Figaro particularly shines, and doesn't seem to tire: his Act Four Aria is especially powerful and captivating.  Fleming's Countess is touching and beautiful, though her acting leaves a little to a desire in this performance.

Audio and Video:

The quality of the DVD is excellent.  My biggest complaint would be the subtitles, which due to their style were somewhat intruisive.  Other than that, an EXCELLENT recording with excellent video quality and superb sound.  This DVD shines especially well with a 5.1 Surround System, where the sound from the Orchestra is utterly surrounding.

Orchestra:

What to say about this?  The orchestra is a bit loud at time, cover up the singers.  Other than that . . . they are PERFECT.  Haitnik coaxes an incredible performance from them.  Every quick section is precise and unified, and every swell is touching and powerful.

1044086,5,6305458405,"Time was when 'taped' performances of staged operas were significant only for the historical value, not for the creative nature of Opera on Film.  Much of that changed with Ingmar Bergman's unforgettable 'Magic Flute', but that again was a movie director's take on both the opera and the backstage workings that accompanied its production.  Now with the technical advances in sound and video production more and more thoroughly successful visual recordings of great opera performances are filling the shelves and bins of music stores. And this 2003 Glyndebourne Festival Opera performance of Mozart's 'Le Nozze di Figaro' (Marriage of Figaro) is among the best.  The cameras and microphones are so adeptly placed that the performance seems like a movie.

Bernard Haitink and the London Philharmonic are gratefully in the pit supporting a cast that not only sings and acts to perfection, they are also consistently beautiful and handsome actors!  Gerald Finley in the title role of Figaro is as fine as they come and his support from Alison Hagley's Susanna is not only musically balanced but visually perfect. Ren&eacute;e Fleming is in top form as the Countess, as are Andreas Schiff and Marie-Ange Todorovitch (Cherubino).  The pacing and interaction of all of the singers under Hiatink's well thought conducting makes one of the finest performances of this opera staple seem as fresh as a Premiere.

We sat spellbound throughout this performance by the Glyndebourne Festival Opera which I originally borrowed from our local library, but loved so much that I immediately ordered it.  The singing was marvellous of course, but beyond that the acting was delightful and convincing, and the sets were so artfully contrived to fit in with the period costumes but also were modern in concept, allowing one's imagination to fill in the details.

Thus, it is so, so refreshing to plunge into this old-world production of Mozart's enchanting opera, where the singers are much less concerned with ""performing"" as they are with discovering, enjoying, sharing.  So liberal are they truly, that to relativize them is to have already betrayed their magnificent craft.

Here, Figaro makes us smile; Susanna makes us friends; Cherubino makes us reflect; and the Don helps us to change.  They sing like different birds.

Immortal Mozart, through the Maestro Bohm and the Vienna Philharmonic, affirms Love and strengthens our hearts.

Though I sense that the great and hidden teachings in this opera must be sought out, yet do its greatest delights and enchanting music shine resplendent for all to share, see, and enjoy.",1117065600,9,927,5.272108843537415
1044089,4,6305458405,"I was disappointed by this production.  It is visually ambitious with good singers, however the huge production seems to drown out a lot of the subtle relationships between the music and the drama.  The editing is mediocre and overall the Opera is not well adapted to home viewing.  The translation also has large holes and often fails to capture humorous details.

I think The Marriage of Figaro is a great Opera for a number of reasons, but first and foremest is the drama and music.  They should balance and complement each other.  The Music should enhance the drama, and the drama should bring meaning to the music.  If Mozart's music has a sudden, unexpected scale, the action on the stage shouldn't ignore it.  If there's a dramatic pause in the music, such as the moment right before ""Signor! Cose Quel Stupore?"" an actor shouldn't be wandering across the stage.  This shatters the intensity of the moment and ruins the humor.

Furthermore, I found Andreas Schmidt's count to be too sympathetic.  I think he played the part well, but I found myself rooting for him much more than I should have been.  Rodney Gilfry's Count, filmed in John Eliot Gardiner's production at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, stole the show with his simpering arrogance.  He was still a sympathetic character, but he got what was coming to him.  I just felt sorry for Schmidt's count, and wish he could have gotten Rosina and Susanna.  Gerald Finley sang well and looks great, but never really got my attention.

As I mentioned, the translation is spotty.  Sometimes I was confused and couldn't follow the action.  Other times, I knew what was supposed to be going on and could tell that the translation was sorely missing the point.  A perfect example is the duettino at the beginning of Act III.  Unless you understand the Italian, you won't get that Susanna keeps slipping up and saying what she means rather than what she means to say.  It's a delightful duettino, but because this translation is done carelessly, in broad strokes, most viewers won't get it.  Hagley and Schmidt sing the scene well, but not to the point where you can get the subtlety without knowing the words.

Finally, a video presentation has the additional responsibility of blending audience perspective with the drama AND the music.  An editor takes the dramatic action of the players on the stage, and assembles a scene.  I think this video does this reasonably well, given the rather significant challenges and the fact that this production seems directed far more for the stage than for a video.  But the editing seems to largely ignore the music, and that ruins some scenes, particularly the Finale of Act II.  It looks confused and unnatural, and the viewer becomes detached.  Hagley and Fleming look confused and frantic, but I don't feel it.  I think about how silly they look being so upset, rather than empathizing.  The stage looks really neat, but at this point it's been there unchanged for 10 minutes, and seeing it is just distracting.  The final cadences of Act II are entirely about the characters and music.  Yet we keep getting odd angles and bizarre illusions from those red lines on the floor.

That said, Le Nozze di Figaro is still a great Opera, with great music, and this production has some great moments.  Renee Fleming's rendition of ""Dove sono i bei momenti"" is particularly wonderful.  Alison Hagley is a wonderful Susanna.  If you know the Opera, and are looking to add another to your collection, I think you'll be satisfied.  If you're looking for an introduction to Mozart and Opera in general, I would recommend something more energetic and better adapted to home viewing.",1116115200,9,3669,4.8128
1044121,5,6305458405,"It seems surprising that such a proletariat opera could come out of 18th century Europe, a narrative where the servants outwit a bungling and hormone-driven Count.  Da Ponte's libretto is based on a play by Pierre Beaumarchais which was initially banned for being too subversive (the opera and play were first performed just a few years before the French revolution of 1789).  In the end, this comedy of manners is essentially about equality, class, forgiveness and redemption, presented with perhaps the greatest music ever written.  The redemption in this opera is a secular one, reflecting the age of enlightenment and teachings of Voltaire (Beaumarchais was also an editor for the complete works of Voltaire as well as being a playwright and an arms dealer). Ironically, we know from his letters that Mozart was not particularly fond of Voltaire's atheistic doctrine, but he was drawn to the story of the characters and their underlying humanity, and so created what could be considered his magnum opus.

The Finale of Act 2 must be one of the greatest pieces of music of all time; ""Conoscete, signor Figaro"" is pure Mozartean magic.  The finale starts as a duet, which turns into a trio, then a quartet until it ends as an octet.  It represented a record in terms of sustained music in opera at the time, and is a testament to Mozart's astonishing genius.

The opening of Act 4 starts with a character suffering a minor setback, as Barbarina, the Gardener's daughter, laments the loss of a pin set to haunting music based on the slow movement from one of Mozart's great piano concerti (No. 18 in B flat major, K. 456). It seems that Mozart is saying even minor set-backs that affect secondary characters are important and emphasises the humanity of his characters.  It is a touching scene.

A highlight of this performance is the English Soprano, Alison Hagley, who gives a delightful performance as Susanna.  Her Susanna was very sympathetic and we truly care about what happens to her.  In the upper registers her voice is very beautiful in a vulnerable way and is appropriate for Susanna.  Susanna, like Zerlina in Don Giovanni, is a simple working-class girl, and yet is the heart and soul of the opera (both characters are given important arias).

The longest ovation is reserved for the wonderful Renee Fleming and her regal performance of the Countess's main Aria in Act 3.  The character of the Countess is distantly related to Wagner's Hans Sachs (Die Meistersinger) and Strauss's Marschallin (Der Rosenkavalier); older and wiser characters who are absent from a significant portion of the opera but in the end offer the most emotional resonance.  In Figaro, it is the Countess who sets things right in the end, and the one who suffered the most to get there.

Two arias in Act 4 are included that tend to be cut out from other performances because they represent slight digressions by secondary characters, especially when presented in the critical final act. However, without them Act 4 is too short and the DVD is richer for their inclusion.

The set design reflects modern minimalist sensibilities, in contrast to the Rococo and Spanish costumes (Marcellina looks like she's just stepped out of one of Goya`s great paintings), but allows us to concentrate on the performance and music. The performance gains from being live, and we can enjoy the appreciative audience response and electric atmosphere that is engendered.  Picture quality, multiple camera work and editing is excellent.  Choreography is laudable, especially in the Ballet in Act 3, as is the overall acting.  Other reviewers have complained about the sound, but the sound is fine on my Sony DVD system.

Because there are so many variables in opera, it is very difficult to have a ""flawless"" performance (whatever that means), but this is one of the things which makes opera so interesting.  However, this Figaro is world class and all the main principals set close to definitive performances for their respective parts.  This is a Figaro to treasure.  With a whole opera on one DVD, this disc is also excellent value.",1112659200,13,4102,4.9374090247452695
1044122,4,6305458405,"Not being an opera connoisseur at all, I can only give an evaluation of this DVD based on what I consider to be its highlights or downturns.

""Le Nozze di Figaro"" is my all time favourite opera and I have seen a few live as well as recorded versions of it. This particular performance is very well achieved and does honour both storyline and grandeur that were certainly idealized by Mozart over 200 years ago.

The best this DVD has to offer is ...

1 - Rene Fleming has one of the best performances of the Countess I have ever seen. Her interpretation of the world famous aria ""Dove sonno i bei momenti"" is, at the very least, memorable.

2 - Alison Hagley is a perfect actress and sings rather well as Susanna. She may not have that ""prima donna"" formula but she has a flawless performance in one of the most demanding roles in the opera (Susanna is a constant presence during the four acts).

3 - Although not mentioned very often, Marie-Ange Todorovitch is the best Cherubino ever. Only her hips betray her true gender, otherwise she would very well pass for a teenage love-seeking boy. She also does honour to Cherubino's well known ""Voi, che sapete"" aria too.

4 - Gerald Finley is ... Gerald Finley, and we all recognize quality when his name figures in any opera's cast.

And the things that don't work that entire well are ...

1 - Wendy Hillhouse is far from being a convincing Marcellina. Not a good actress and she really fails to deliver during Marcellina's solo aria ""Il capro e la capreta"" (and this is noticeable by the audience's less than enthusiastic reaction).

2 - Andreas Schmidt is a powerful bass but he is too expressive and sometimes he looks like a serial killer rather than a Count.

3 - Wardrobe is far from being the best I've seen so far and the Countess's gala dress looks like it was made from old curtains.

4 - The scenario is also very poor, but it was conceived to change quickly from one area of the palace to another, but this was achieved on the expense of the expected richness of an 18th century palace. Alas ...

My final (and humble) verdict is ... there are many more pros than cons in this version and the interaction between the characters works remarkably well. A very good version of the famous opera definitely worth buying.",1108598400,4,2275,4.481840193704601
1044123,3,6305458405,"Badly staged but beautifully sung, this 1994 Glyndebourne production is not the definitive, must-have DVD of ""Figaro"" that I would so like to find.  I realize that ""definitive"" is a relative term, but one would at least hope that the elements of musical and stage direction, voices and design would come together better than they do here.  The five leads do their best (and their best is quite good, thank you), but there are many, many distractions.  Fleming (looking very heavy and exhausted) sings ravishingly, but is costumed so badly -- her gray wig is ridiculous and comical -- you have to wonder if she was personally disliked by the designer.  Poor Andreas Schmidt suffers similarly, looking positively stuffed into his costumes.  Finley and Hagley fare much better, creating lovely characterizations and -- I must stress again --they ALL sing beautifully.  But this is not a CD, this is a live production and the artists are given no help from the designer, John Gunter, or the director, Stephen Medcalf, both of whom seem to have gone out of their way to present the piece in as dull and utilitarian a way as they could.  And I completely agree with many of the previous reviewers: the sound mix is terrible.  I cannot believe that a conductor as skilled as Haitink would purposefully drown out his cast, or that an ensemble this skilled would not be able to keep up with his orchestra -- so someone in the sound booth was asleep at the switch.  I appreciated having seen this version of ""Figaro,"" but will continue my search for the DVD in which the elements mesh more successfully.  I mean, what's the point of a DVD if you can only enjoy it with your eyes closed?",1103241600,16,1676,4.670068027210885
1044124,2,6305458405,"I purchased this DVD with some trepidation given the disparity of opinions among the reviewers. I was disappointed. I would characterize this as an unoffensive but completely uninspired production. I have no beef with the quality of the singing, but the staging, acting, and direction show a mimimum of effort, imagination or emotion. This is a humorless, lifeless production of Figaro. Scenes that have moved me to tears or to guffaws in other productions were rushed through or dismissed as though they weren't worth bothering with in this production. I am by no means an audiophile, but even I was bothered by the poor quality of the sound.  Singers literally cannot be heard when they stand at certain areas of the stage (a glaring problem in the ensemble pieces). I'm continuing my search for a great production of Figaro on VHS/DVD.  Any suggestions?",1097452800,6,856,4.979020979020979
1044125,5,6305458405,"No, it isn't a problem, 'cause we have one of the best renditions of ""Le Nozze di Figaro"". Here, the conductor is Karl Bhm, a master in Mozart's music (although a little sleepy in his last years, not the case here), and the main singers are marvellous too: Berry is a clever Figaro, great on stage and with a strong voice; Wixell as The Count contrasts perfectly with his servant, singing with a noble timbre. Grist was one of Bhm's most frequent choices, and sings an idiomatic Susanna . Claire Watson wasn't the best Contessa at that time, but looks like a member of ""noblesse"" and overall is satisfactory.

Comprimarii singers are good, as the chorus. And the orchestra is Wiener Philharmoniker, no more words about this.

This is a Salzburg Festival's production, taped at 1966. Good image in B&W, nice sound. For a modern production, look at Gardiner's, but this is indispensable.",1095206400,15,885,4.777777777777778

Swedish baritone Ingvar Wixell is Count Almaviva, and it is unbelievable how his voice sounded in his younger days.  He enunciates so clearly that you could hear exactly what he is saying throughout the entire production so well that you could write out the words he sings just from hearing him.  his voice is also marvelous and will enchant you until he is all that you can think about.  Walter Berry is Figaro, and will make sure that there is a smile on your face throughout the entire production; he is very funny, a good actor, and has a beautiful bass voice suited wonderfully for his part.  American soprano Reri Grist is a very sweet and dainty Susanna and almost could make you cry after hearing how beautifuly she sings the rond, ""Deh, vieni, non tardar"" in the fourth act.  Many buyers might consider it a disadvantage that this DVD is not in color, but anyone who enjoys a good opera regardless of the recording would love it.  Even without the color, the sound quality is wonderful.  The staging is also very clever and appealing.  This was filmed at the Vienna State Opera in 1966 under the baton of Karl Bhm.",1078617600,23,1324,4.506276150627615
1044128,5,6305458405,"I just bought this Figaro and loved it.  The cast, sets and conducting seemed almost perfect.  My only complaint was that the titles were a little insufficent at times and they were way to big -- smaller print would have been less intrusive.  Re the Nixon in China, I've always loved that opera and was present the night of the taping that was broadcast on PBS many years ago.  I also saw a concert version of it here in San Francisco before the stage premier in Houston.  The likelyhood of it ever appearing on DVD is probably only a fantasy.  I watched my tape of it last weekend and was as thrilled as ever with it.  I know many folks don't like it but for me it just hits all the right spots.  With my new computer, I've just finished converting it to DVD to preserve it since as I said before it is highly unlikely it will become available commercially.",1076371200,2,858,4.285714285714286

1044173,5,6305458405,"Most of the complaints regarding this DVD have been about the ""average sound mix"" and ""boring set design,"" which are incorrect and exaggerated.  The sound is fine.  I had no trouble hearing the singers.  The orchestral playing is never obtrusive and there's a clarity to the recording.  I'm not sure if these reviewers need to adjust their tv's audio settings or cables but I have 32"" Sony Trinitron, 5-disc DVD player with regular RCA cables and had absolutely no problems with the sound.
As far as set design goes, it all depends on the opera.  With a work like Figaro where the characters and acting are what drive the story as opposed to say, The Magic Flute, which is a more visual opera, sets are simply not as important.  That's not to say that the staging on this Glydenbourne production is weak.  It is, in fact, very beautifully done.  The key here is subtlety.  The designs are minimal but I think most viewers will find them tasteful, pleasing to the eye and overall quite effective with excellent lighting (sample the moment where Susana tells Figaro about the counts intentions in ""Se a caso madama"" and Act IV in the woods) that is both subtely suggestive and atmospheric.  Nothing is overdone and ample space is given for the wonderful performers to act and move freely.
Fittingly, it is the singers in this production that shine.  Alison Hagley is just a beautiful woman, not to mention her lovely singing and the fun she has with her role (her ""Via resti servita"" is delightful).  Gerald Finley's Figaro is lean and powerful.  His ""Se vuol ballare"" is bold and has weight.  You can really hear his contempt.  Marie-Ange Todorovitch's Cherubino is my favorite.  Her ""Non so piu"" will overwhelm you as she sings it with a swelling fullness and joy that gives you goose bumps.  The entire cast is just on.  There is no pretentiousness and only love for the music.  Everyone is at ease and there is very nice flow with Haitink's perfectly judged tempi.  The entire show is the closest thing to perfection I have seen.
My only complaint is the lack of extra features.  I've been spoiled with the DVD medium and always look forward to the interviews and commentaries that are added to these discs and unfortunately there are none to be found here.  But this is a minor complaint.  The performance is well worth the price.  By the way, you can get this DVD for a great price at deepdiscountdvd.com where I bought my copy.

1044174,4,6305458405,"This is generally a sparkling, enjoyable production. The principal singers do a wonderful job both musically and dramatically, and it's a treat to see people in these roles who are young enough to ""fit"" the characters properly. [Finley and Hagley are superb!] Bernard Haitink and the London Philharmonic are an absolute delight.

However, two caveats. The sets are a slightly uneasy mix of flats in Ellsworth-Kelly-esque primary colors and dabs of period furniture; also, the lights dim for ""serious"" moments, an annoying, superficial touch. Much more problematic is the DVD sound mix. The orchestra comes off superbly, but voices are sometimes lost and muffled-sounding. I actually checked my center channel to see if it was active!  Balance-wise, the stereo version is no better.  This is just a word of caution to those who like to hear the SINGERS in an opera.

[I am going to add a 2010 postscript to this review. I recently revisited this dvd and found I was much less put off by the sets and lighting. In fact, they're rather creative, and seldom do they obtrude. Same for the distinctive acting/staging touches. My feelings about the sound remain about the same. The voices are occasionally put in the shade by the orchestra, and there's a generic, mp3 quality to many spots. Perhaps this reflects the experience of live performance more accurately than the old practice of spotlighting the vocals for a recording. But the issue is compounded by the digital sound compression that was obviously used in order to squeeze Mozart's 3 hours and 10 minutes of music onto a single dvd.]",1064016000,68,1588,4.958646616541353

Alison Hagley is a beautifull Susanna that not only sings incredible, but also acts incredible! And this is what this DVD is all about, it puts together some incredible singing with some great and really comic acting.
Haitink and the London Philharmonic are simply marvellous, as is most of the cast. Renee Fleming is perferct as the countess (as those who know her should expect) and Gerald Finley is a very good Figaro, both singing and acting. The scenery is simple but convincing.
I have nearly 50 opera DVDs and this one has been one of my favorites for some time. VERY enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",1050883200,13,749,4.514705882352941

This production is full of great performances and is easy to enjoy visually.  The camera keeps us involved without making us aware of its work.  The costumes are not overly colorful, but I like the subtlety - especially at 190 minutes!
Gerald Finlay is a wonderful Figaro.  I love his voice and presence.  Alison Hagley has a wonderful voice and sings Susanna with great joy and she can act.  Renee Fleming is transcendent as The Countess.  Who can praise her enough?  She seems to glow and her voice transfixes me.  Andreas Schmidt is a wonderfully despicable Almaviva.
The subtitles make it easy for non-Italian speaker who want to follow along to do so.  I played this performance for my 11 year-old daughter and 10 year-old son and wondered how long they would last.  I thought I would just expose them to the opera.  They were mesmerized and didn't want to even take a break between tapes.  They were caught up in the story and watching it happen made it much more enjoyable for them than just listening to it.
My only wish is that these tapes would be transferred to DVD.  Tapes wear out and bleed over time.  Performances as wonderful as this one need to be preserved so we can enjoy them for decades.  We need a better medium than VHS tapes.",1045180800,13,1479,4.583969465648855

This soprano was not known to me prior to viewing this production.  But after hearing her sing Susanna, I can say she is one of the best sopranos today.  Her aria in the final act holds enough emotion to draw tears.  I found my skin crawling from the intense beauty of her voice.  Hagley and Fleming also sing a duet in the third act where their melding voices sound like Sirens, harmonizing perfectly.  If this is what Ulysses heard, then it is understandable why he wanted to crash his boat right into the shores.

Not as good aspects:
- This is the most Romantic recording of Nozze that I've ever heard. I don't know if it was the mic placement or what, but there are parts in this recording that sound like they've come from a Beethoven symphony. During the overture, I found myself oddly noticing a bassoon part that had zero musical importance. Brass are consistently overfull.
- No shade to the queen, but Fleming and Mozart are not friendly towards each other. She excelled in 19th and 20th century music where a little bit of rubato and portamenti could go a long way. Here, she sounds out of place. And her acting choices in Act IV (or acceptance of the director's instructions) are bizarre and out of character for the Countess.

Part of the confusion seems to be reviews of DVDs from different publishers and different formats -- they might not all be the same despite Amazon's tendency to lump them all together.  My review concerns a standard DVD format published by TDK with a media copyright of 2003 and a live performance from 1966.  I watched this on a 53 in upscaling HD monitor and an above average sound system oriented toward classical music.  The conductor is Karl Bohm and Figaro is played by a magnificent Walter Berry.  Mr. Berry was 37 at the time of the performance -- perhaps a little old for Figaro's chronologic age, but clearly his voice was in great shape.  The production is in black and white. The sound is Mono.  The image is very soft with less contrast between white and black then I expect for productions from this period.  However the images are clear.  The sound is clean and clear.  The English subtitles were fine.  The set is minimalistic but the various acts and scenes are clearly delineated.  Except for perhaps Act 4 the production did not become confused despite the complex plot.  Act 4 might have benefited by a more substantial garden allowing the various characters to actually hide from each other.  What is most impressive about this production, in my mind, is Mr. Berry -- its not just his voice but his acting and his body language makes him a perfect Figaro.

7890985,2,6305458405,"Very disappointed with this production. Thankfully I didn't buy it just listened to it from another source. The major singers of Count, Countess, Susanna and Figaro, except for Finley and maybe the singer who sang the count, were all off their game. Fleming is great as always (I consider her to be one of the three greatest Contessas of all time, the other 2 being Kiri Te Kanawa and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf) but this performance pales in comparison to the Met one. At times the singers are not even on beat with the music they tend to rush through their parts. The other supporting singers were, I'm sorry to say, quite atrocious. The base who sang Bartolo had no voice and nearly cracked on his part with that scratchy voice. The other sopranos were shrill with shrieky tops and no good phrasing. And yes, the Mezzo who sang Cherubino is quite horrible. The set design is ugly and the actors were too forceful with both the singing and the acting. Unlike some other reviewers I didn't have a problem with the tempo in the slightest. That wasn't the problem, it's the uninspired performance overall that attempted at all of the so-called post-modernism, only failed miserably.

Honestly just go listen to the Barbara Bonney version. That one is not only THE COMPLETE Le Nozze Di Figaro (in its complete original 4 hours that Mozart originally composed, probably the only copy you will find), but IT IS MOZART. Despite a tempo being too fast on some of the arias, that version is how Mozart should be sung. Listen to the pure lyrical beautiful voices complementing each other, listen to the perfect harmonies and counter harmonies where you can hear all the voices as clearly individually as they are put together.
