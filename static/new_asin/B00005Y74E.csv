1675057,4,B00005Y74E,"This PPV got a bad rap already but I found it to be a very good Pay Per View!
1. Cyrus & Jerry Lynn vs. Christian York & Joey Matthews
Thoughts: Broken up early on by The Baldies it was a squash and Cyrus and Lynn win easily by pinfall after the Cradle Piledriver.
Rating: 2 (5 Stars - Still Entertaining)
- Promo by Jerry Lynn
2. Danny Doring and Roadkill vs. Hot Commodity
Thoughts: Very well done tag match and was also a spotfest by Hot Commodity and even Roadkill on some certain points.
Rating: 4.5 (5 Stars)
3. Nova vs. Chris Hamrick
Thoughts: Nova is back and with a new look, new moves and evrything he is a entertaining wrestler to watch in this match but in the end it's broken up by former partner of Nova - Guess Who!
Rating: 4 (5 Stars)
4. Tommy Dreamer vs. ""The Enforcer"" C.W. Anderson (I QUIT MATCH)
Thoughts: Very well done match by both and could have possibly stole the show if longer. The Enforcer shows his very good skills and carries Dreamer threw-out match. This is a good one with my first look at The Enforcer.
Rating: 4 (5 Stars)
5. Mikey Whipwreck/Tajiri vs. FBI vs. Kid Kash/Super Crazy
Thoughts: Very entertaining but I know that It could have been better. The match still recieves 5 Stars because it was a very well put together match but I'm not the biggest fan of The FBI even though this is my first look at them.
Rating: 5 Stars
6. Simon Diamond/Johnny Swinger vs. Balls Mahoney/Chilly Willy
Thoughts: Swinger starts the match with a promo but yet again the match was Another DUD but then again it was my first look at ECW's version of the Man Beast as he broke up the match early on. But was my best look at him as he practically missed every GORE! GORE! GORE! But we get to see Dawn Marie and Jasmine St. Claire w/. Blue Boy (Blue Meanie). Very cool Piledriver off ropes by Rhino on Jasmine St. Claire.
Rating: DUD
- Promo by Rhyno
7. TLCC - The Sandman vs. Justin Credible vs. Steve Corino
Thoughts: This match was for the ECW Title and I thought this match left most to the imagination as it wasn`t a very good match and was a brawling match that I don`t particularly care for but none the less it's practically better than what the World Wrestling Federation gives us! A sign of good will by all three exchanging hands.
Rating: 3 (5 Stars)
8. The Sandman (c) vs. Rhino (ECW TITLE)
Thoughts: SQUASH - Easy win for The Man Beast Rhino
Rating: 2 (5 Stars)
- Cyrus w/. Rhino calls out anyone to face the man beast Rhino and RVD accepts to a THUNDEROUS applause.
- RVD gets attacked by Jerry Lynn before fighting Rhino and match changes
9. Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam (Whole F'N Show Will Be Decided)
Thoughts: Match was very entertaining but not their best performance together! But none the less very very good match to top of a steller PPV.
Rating: 4.5 Stars
- Promo by Francine/Justin Credible/Steve Corino

Also, ppv also has promos and segments but forgot place:

DISC FEATURES:
- Match by Match History
  ECW Guilty as Charged 2001 was a very good buy and I recommend it to anyone!",1017187200,,3126,4.397236614853195
1675058,4,B00005Y74E,"The only reason this pay-per view is being released over all the other pay-per view's is because it is the last ECW event that was viewable around the world (or at least North America). Though it was obviously not their greatest show ever, frankly it wasn't even average, but this is a must have for any ECW fan and any wrestling fan, for that matter. If I could give it three and a half stars I would but I can't and it would pain me to much to give something with the letters ECW on it three stars so I'm settling on four.
Christian York, Joey Matthews vs. Cyrus, Jerry Lynn - Match never really happens, the Baldies strike York and Matthews and Lynn finishes them off with a Cradle Piledriver. ...
ECW World Tag Team Championship Danny Doring, Roadkill (c) vs. Hot Commodity - Not a bad match, a few missed spots but hit the ones that counted. I'm a fan of all these guys and they weren't putting in a 100%, I've seen them do better. (**)
Nova vs. Chris Hamrick - Without all the outside shinanigans this would have been an alright match, but the involvement of Chetti, Spike, and Lou E. Dangerously ruined it. ...
I Quit Match Tommy Dreamer vs. C.W. Anderson - Tommy Dreamer is a guy who was never given a chance to shine during the WWF Invasion angle, a match like this one and the even better one previous to this pay-per view would have really launched him into the company. Great technical wrestler from C.W., great original brawling from Tommy, all together great match. ...
Three Way Dance Full Blooded Italians vs. Kid Kash, Super Crazy vs. Mikey Whipwreck, Yoshihiro Tajiri - This match has a title shot on the line and each team looked like they really wanted it. Great spots in this one and near 15 minutes long just as the I quit match. Isn't it great to see 15 minute matches again unlike the dribble we see in the WWF. ...
Johnny Swinger, Simon Diamond vs. Balls Mahoney, Chilly Willy - Pointless match to get Rhino over as he destroys all four men quite easily. (*)
ECW World Heavyweight Championship Steve Corino (c) vs. The Sandman vs. Justin Credible - Not bad match, but not great. Big disapointment, especially after the double jeopardy match a while  back which was one of the best matches of 2000. This certainly wasn't what I wanted to remember ECW by. ...
ECW World Heavyweight Championship Sandman (c) vs. Rhino - Pretty short, once again Rhino pretty much cleans house as Sandman is fatigued. ...
Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - It would've been a lot cooler if Rhino agreed to face RVD tonight but only after he beat Jerry Lynn and then Rhino beat RVD and started a feud but I guess I'm the booker. Good match but it's not nearly as good as the Hardcore Heaven bout, but decent. ...",1015027200,3,2709,4.418
1675059,4,B00005Y74E,"Great PPV..But unfort, it was the last Ever ECW show, seen on TV..and we see the World Title change hands 2x in 10 minutes, and see the last ECW battle between, RVD and Jerry Lynn..

7956625,4,B00005Y74E,"Christian York & Joey Matthews vs. Jerry Lynn & Cyrus - This match never really got started as York & Matthews were attacked by Da Baldies before the match took place & this was really just to setup what would happen with Lynn & tease the suprise for later in the show.

Tag Team Champions Danny Doring & Amish Roadkill vs. Hot Commodity - My copy of this event is damaged during this match so I can't comment.

Nova vs. Chris Hamrick - See above.

""I Quit"" Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. C.W. Anderson - This was not only the rematch from their previous PPV encounter but also Dreamer still looking for revenge for being out for weeks due to an injury caused by Anderson and we saw where Dreamer's mind was when he prevented Anderson from doing his signature throat slice taunt during the introductions.  Both men started exchaning chops on the outside & back in the ring with both men exchanging submission moves such as the dragon sleep & armbar & boston crab before Dreamer heavily focused on Anderson's arm being the innovator of violence by using a chair & the ring post along with other weapons such as the ringbell & hammer busting Anderson open but Anderson was able to recover launching Dreamer off the apron into the guardrail & used a chair in various ways such a drop toe hold & atomic drop along with various chairshots. They continued to trade momentum with the towel boy getting involved handing Dreamer ""Christmas presents"" including razor wire with Anderson giving him a reciept as they continued to punish each other in different ways such a spinebuster on the razor wire, vertical suplex on open chairs, death valley driver off the second rope through a table, and a vicious version of the crossface that not only hurt the neck but the eyes as well to the point where both men gained a mutual respect for each other & showed it after the match.  This was the career match for C.W. Anderson as they had a very physical competitive match.
[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches]

Yoshihiro Tajiri & Mikey Whipwreck vs. Kid Kash & Super Crazy vs. The F.B.I. - This was to determine the #1 contenders to the ECW Tag Team Championship with a member of each team allowed in the ring at one time. This was very fast paced from the start of the action with members of every team showcasing their styles as there were so many moments & spots like Tajiri delivering his strong stiff kicks, Guido's shoot wrestling, back to back to back to back aerial moves from the F.B.I. & Kash followed by dual submissions from Tajiri & Mikey, Kash & Crazy moonsaulting everyone on the outside, Big Sal E. Grazino getting involved...just so much fast paced action & offense that I can't possibly try to summarize it all but it was the action expected from all of the names involved.
[ECW Unreleased Vol. 1]

Balls Mahoney & Chilly Willy vs. Simon Diamond & Swinger - This was another match that never really got started as everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) was destoryed by one man who was on a rampage & was more of a tease of what was going to happen later in the night.

Tables & Ladders & Chairs & Canes Match: ECW Champion Steve Corino vs. Sandman vs. Justin Credible - Corino was the ECW Champion going into this match but Sandman had physical posession of the title since the previous PPV while Credible still had unfinished business with both men leading to this match here.  The ladder came into play early & throughout in the match being used as a weapon such as one man launching it into another, one ladder being rode down upon another ladder, a ladder setup in the corner with a body tossed into it, a bulldog onto the ladder, the ladder being chairshotted into another man's crotch, the classic Terry Funk helicoper ladder spin, a suplex onto the ladder, and the ladder taking such a beating that it couldn't take anymore.  All three men continued to fight each other including some unlikely alliances formed along with the other weapons coming into play such as each man being caned at some point, going out of the ring through a table on more than one occassion, and the managers at ringside getting involved as well including a ""coochie-conrana.""  This wasn't a ladder match filled with memorable ""highlight reel"" moments more than just a very physical fight with the weapons being brought into play for more impact.
[ECW: Extreme Rules]

ECW Champion Sandman vs. Rhino - Rhino continued his rampage from earlier in the night by attacking Sandman after the match & challenging him for his World Title in what was a heavily one sided affair as Rhino just kept beating on Sandman after he already went through a hellacious match to the point where he finally had nothing else to give.  This wasn't much of a match but did it's job.

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - This match was a completely different setup than a majority their previous matches in ECW as this one wasn't for a championship, Lynn wasn't a fan favorite at this point in his career & had Cyrus in his corner, and RVD was returning after a long absence without Bill Alfonzo in his corner. The early exchanges between both men sent them into a stalemate before going over the top to the outside with RVD having his mouth bleeding from going into the guardrails but being able to recover with a moonsault press off the guardrail followed by his trademark corkscrew legdrop onto Lynn on the guardrail. Both men traded momentum with RVD delivering a backflip splash then second rope moonsault splash, Lynn doing a hard clothesline to RVD's bleeding mouth, RVD's running chair dropkick in the corner, and Lynn catching RVD on top rope with powerbomb onto chair followed by a DDT onto the chair. This wasn't a classic as their previous battles over the television title but still a high quality encounter that saw both Cyrus & his nemesis getting involved but it mostly remembered as the final original ECW match that a majority of people saw.
[Rob Van Dam: One Of A Kind]

While it wasn't a conclusion at the end of the night with ECW still advertising the Living Dangerously PPV in March throughout the show but this was the final televised event in ECW history (they would go on to have two more house shows later in the month) with a lot of the talents from top to bottom going all out like it was the final show.  This was an emotional evening looking back at it now & this event is a piece of history that I suggest anyone who's a fan of ECW needs to have in their collection.",1369353600,,6442,4.559688581314879
7956626,2,B00005Y74E,"Great moments in history but not the same feel as when I watched it air live in 1997. All of the entrances, music, and interview segments have been cut out.

7956628,5,B00005Y74E,"One of the best wrestling events of 2001. wrestling-wise better then WWE's ECW. My favorite match was the ""I Quit"" match between Tommy Dreamer & C.W. Anderson which was a good reminder of the infamous ""I Quit"" bout between Magnum T.A. & Tully Blanchard from NWA Starrcade 1985. The RVD-Jerry Lynn closing bout while not as good as their matches,it was still great brawl to end on. The 3 way T.L.C.C. World title match was just as hardcore as any ECW bout on the card. The rest were ok. Waaay wrestling-wise better then WCW's last PPV Show (Greed) or WCW's last Nirto show for that matter. Even the last-minute title between Rhino & [information unavailble] had better wrestling then most of the matches on WCW's last Nirto card. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1205884800,,759,4.547445255474453
7956629,3,B00005Y74E,"ECW's final pay-per-view, ""Guilty As Charged"" which aired in January of 2001 live from the Hammerstein Ballroom in NYC was not exactly the defining moment in the company's history but it definitely had its share of moments. On this night, we got to see the surprise ECW return of Rob Van Dam as he took on longtime nemesis Jerry Lynn in the final match of their classic series of matches in ECW. There was a weapon-filled 3-Way Dance between Steve Corino, The Sandman, and Justin Credible for the ECW World Title. In watching ""Guilty"", it seemed like the ECW product was somewhat becoming stale. While the in-ring matches were as solid as ever, the once cutting-edge promos and backstage vignettes lacked creativety and relied too heavily on profanity and low-brow sexual inuendo. Since its inception, ECW has always pushed the envelope in being hardcore but on this night, it seemed like they were pushing dirty humor for the simple fact that they had nothing else to offer. Involving Missy Hyatt in the show could have made for some interesting TV but rather than using her to her full potential, they just had her cut a backstage promo where she appeared in a towel and was supposedly giving Justin Credible ""oral pleasure"" behind closed doors. Much like its previous editions of ECW pay-per-views, Pioneer's DVD for ""Guilty"" has been edited and altered to remove a majority of the entrance music due to copyright reasons. This unfortunately means that a number of the actual ring entrances have been taken out. If you're a longtime ECW fan, you'll probably want to pick up this DVD but if you're new to the ECW brand, this may not be the best title to introduce you to the product.",1113868800,,1685,4.7542662116040955

Although many fans complain that the show at times appears to be stitched together with many impromptu matches and last minute looking decisions, the show overall is very entertaining and a great final showing for a company that tried so hard to survive in a world determined to kill them off!  Some higlights from the show include the long awaited return of Rob Van Dam to ring action to face off in another classic battle with arch-nemesis Jerry Lynn!  The Sandman wins his fourth ECW World Heavyweight Title after beating out Justin Credible aand Steve Corino, only to lose the title to Rhyno minutes later making it possibly th shortest World Title reign in sports entertainment history!

7956632,4,B00005Y74E,"In a time of today where WWE ruled the wrestling world, it's not too cool to see that they are the only one that's offering the product on a mass audience scale, and it doesnt even look as good as it could be. Makes me long for the days when there was actual competition from other companies, like ECW. Guilty As Charged 2K1 was the last Pay Per View ever done by the Philadelphia company, and it turned out to be one of the better ones they ever did in their history. While the show may not be as good as it can be in some areas, it is still better than what the WWE is offering today. Here are the match-by-match breakdown:
1. The Network (Jerry ""New F'n Show"" Lynn and Cyrus) Vs. Josh Matthews and Christian York: Not much of a match as the Baldies crashed Matthews' and York's entrance and pummelled them all the way to the ring. Lynn and Cyrus came in and match ended with the Cradle Piledriver by Lynn to give the Network the W.
2. World Tag Team Championship match: Danny Doring and Roadkill (champs) Vs. Hot Commodity w/ Chris Hamrick and Electra- Great match from the tag teams with lots of technical moves and double teaming. Champs retain, then got beaten up by HC and Hamrick. Nova then comes to the rescue, which leads into...
3. Impromptu Match #1: Nova Vs. ""Confederate Currency"" Chris Hamrick- The New Nova shows off new attitude and moves and all. Great wrestling displayed here. The end was bad, though, with Chris Chetti, Lou E. Dangerously and Spike Dudley all got involved in the end. Nova wins it with the Kryptonite Krunch.
4. ""I Quit"" match: ""The innovator of Violence"" Tommy Dreamer Vs. CW ""The Enforcer"" Anderson- Brawling, technical wrestling, weapons and blood. This match has it all here. Lots and lots of sick bumps taken by both men in the match. In the end, Anderson submitted to TD.
5. 3 Way battle for the Tag Team Title's #1 Contenders status: ""Japanese Buzzsaw"" Yoshihiro Tajiri & Mikey Whipwreck Vs. Super Crazy & Kid Kash VS. The FBI- Now this is action-packed wrestling!! Very fast, very innovative match makes this the match of the show. The display of submission moves at one point in the match by all three teams was incredible. Tajiri and Whipwreck took this one after delivering simultaneous Tiger Suplexes on the FBI.
6. Chilly Willy & Balls Mahoney Vs. Simon Diamond & Johnny Swinger: Not much of a match here either, as Rhino came and destroyed all four combatants AND their valets (Jasmine and Dawn Marie). ALso, Blue Boy took a gore from Rhino too.
7. World Heavyweight Championship Match: Tables, Ladders, Chairs and Canes- The Sandman Vs. Steve Corino Vs. Justin Credible: As Francine and Jack Victory roamed around ringside, this match played itself out as an incredibly violent and exciting match from all three men. The Title is suspended above the ring. Lots of action and double teaming, with the TLCC's being employed very well by the all three. Sandman takes it here.
8. Impromptu Match #2: World Title- Rhino Vs. The Sandman: Rhino crashed Sandman's celebration and destroyed everyone in his sight. Then after extorting the Sandman to face him for the world title, he destroyed him with gores and piledrivers through tables. Rhino is YOUR last ever ECW champ.
9. Impromptu Match #3:Rhino Vs. Rob Van Dam- After the win, Cyrus came into the ring, congratulated his Man Beast for the win, and challenged anyone from any wrestling company to take on Rhino. ""Walk"" by Pantera hits, and we get RVD on the scene, back after filming ""Black Mask 2"" in Thailand. As Rhino and RVD was about to face off for the World Title, Jerry Lynn crashed the party,and Rhino fled with the belt. So with that, we have..
10. Main Event: Rob Van Dam Vs. Jerry Lynn- Lynn's wish to main event at the beginning of the  show comes true, albeit against his nemesis, RVD. Not the best match out of their numerous encounters in ECW, but it is still good, with lots of action by both men. Cyrus interfered, which brought out Joel Gertner to DDT him, and RVD finished Lynn off with two of his chair-assisted finishers: the Van Daminator and the awesome Van Terminator.
  So there you go, ECW's last ever show went down with a bang, and so did the company soon after. Much better show than a lot of the PPV's you get from WWE nowadays. A great show to pick up for any wrestling fan or ECW newbies.",1039392000,10,4322,4.56701030927835
7956633,5,B00005Y74E,"Guilty as Charged 2001 was ECW's last Pay-Per-View before filing for bankruptcy and heading up to the big wrestling ring in the sky.  While the pay-per-view card was comprised of a bunch of ""WHO are theys?????"" and seemed to be booked together at the last minute, the matches themselves were wrestled very well in ECW's signature high work rate, high spot fest style that made them famous.  Overall, it was great for what it is, 2 hours or so of great adrenaline pumping ooohing and aaaahing entertainment.
Here's the rundown of the matches featured on this DVD:
THE MATCHES
Televised on January 7, 2001 from the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City
Your hosts are Joey Styles, Joel Gertner and Cyrus the Network Virus
1. Show introduction ring promo by Joey Styles and Joel Gertner with Gertner giving his patented (and to date) most filthy overt sexual laden intro yet.
2. Match 1:  Joey Matthews and Christian York vs. Jerry Lynn and Cyrus:  Non-match as the Baldies ambush York and Matthews for Lynn and Cyrus.  A few spots were gotten off by York and Matthews but it was otherwise a rubbish segment.  DUD
3. Jerry Lynn promo followed by the ECW opening montage
4. Match 2:  Danny Doring and Roadkill (champs) defending against Hot Commodity (EZ Money and Julio Dinero) w/Elektra and Chris Hamrick:  Great in-ring action from all participants with great double team maneuvers and otherwise innovative moves as is the norm for ECW.  4 stars
5. Match 3:  Nova vs. Chris Hamrick:  Impromptu match as Nova runs-out and attacks Hamrick.  Decent match between the two with cool spots and action also featuring appearances by Chris Chetti, Lou E. Dangerously and Spike Dudley.  3 3/4 stars
6. Steve Corino (w/ Jack Victory) promo
7. Match 4:  C.W. Anderson vs. Tommy Dreamer in an ""I Quit Match:""  GREAT submission/hardcore plunder match.  Lots of weapons, lots of submission wrestling.  Definitely one of the best matches on the PPV in my opinion.  4 1/2 stars
8. More sexually innuendoed backstage hijinks backstage with Steve Corino, Jack Victory, Francine, Justin Credible and Missy Hyatt.
9. Match 5:  Yoshihiro Tajiri/Mikey Whipwreck (w/Sinister Minister) vs. the FBI (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke w/Sal E. Graziano) vs. Super Crazy and Kid Kash in a #1 Contenders match for the tag belts:  Another great match with TONS of high spots, double team maneuvers, etc.  The first half of the match was more of a spot fest, but the action and drama picked up in the second half.  4 stars
10. Sandman promo
11. Match 6:  Simon Diamond and Swinger (w/ Dawn Marie, the Blue Boy and Jasmine) vs.  Chilly Willy and Balls Mahoney:  Match starts off with a bunch of promos. Non-match anyway as Rhino came down and kills everyone.  Great if you're into violence but otherwise a DUD match.
12. Rhino promo
13. Match 7:  Steve Corino (w/Victory) vs. Justin Credible (w/Francine) vs. Sandman for the Heavyweight Title in a Tables, Ladders, Chairs and Canes match:  Decent match with TONS of hardcore plunder spots with all the weapons.  3 3/4 stars.
14. Post-match antics with the Baldies and Rhino.
15. Match 8:  Impromptu match between Rhino and Sandman for the title.  As per norm with Rhino, TONS of violence.  DUD
16. Match 9:  Impromptu main event, Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam:  Typical match between these two.  A little slow at the beginning but there were tons of high spots, chain wrestling and overall great action.  4 stars
17. Promo by Corino and Credible declaring themselves the ""New Impact Players.""
DVD Features:
The DVD contains match history write-ups by Jim Johnston III, the same guy who did the ECW website and the previous ECW DVDs.  Overall, the match histories give good background info on the storylines that led up to the matches and are a good read prior to viewing the matches themselves.
THE VERDICT:
Overall, some (justifiably) complained that some of the matches were complete rubbish and a waste and things seemed to have been ""stitched"" together with a lot of impromptu match-ups.  While true, the Pay-Per-View itself served its purpose.  It was entertaining.  For everyone rubbish match there were two entertaining matches.  The matches that were done were done VERY well (the tag title match, submission match and 3-way tag match in particular).  Overall, while the show itself may have had the stated shortcomings, the show itself was very entertaining and is therefore worth the watch.  Though ECW was indeed dying, it didn't go out with a wimper but rather in a blaze of glory.
In sum, whether rented, borrowed or bought, this show is...
Recommended",1019174400,6,4576,4.873056994818653
7956634,4,B00005Y74E,"For begginners of ECW this is a great pay-per-view to watch.  I personally enjoyed this event.  I became an ECW addict two months before it went dow.  For someone trying to get the feeling of ECW, this is the event.  It has all the aspects.  Some good wrestling, great interruptions and twisting plots.  For already-ECW addicts, they might not find it appealing for it is the normal show that can be stupid.

The Jerry Lynn Math against the two Hardy wannabes is okay.  It's just cool to see them get the [stuffing]kicked out of them.
The Tag-Team Title Match D.D and Roadkill versus EZ Money and Julio Dinero was pretty cool and a great match overall.
The Nova-Hamrick match was okay and I thought the finish was a good finish with Spike Dudley interfering
CW versus Tommy Dreamer Was a good match, with CW taking a vicious bump through a table
The Triple Threat Match was amazing and hands down the best match of the night.  It will amaze you.  I've seen the match over 20 times.  It just shows you how Tajiri is underutilized.  That the WWF should pick up Kash, mamaluk,Crazy and Guido.  IT really is a shame Whipwreck is retired.
Credible v. Corino v. Sandman.  Very sloppy match and stupid hand-shake in the end.  It really was stupid and overrated spots where u've seen that the Sandman has done it a million times.
Rhino beat...Sandman and that was a lot of fun.
RVD V. Jerry Lynn.  Great match but not their best and a great finisher.",1018828800,,1442,4.5096525096525095
