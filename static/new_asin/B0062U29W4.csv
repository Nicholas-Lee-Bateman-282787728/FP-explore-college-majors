8491474,4,B0062U29W4,"Systematic and clear. Not everything (the pranayama) what is in the book is shown here. Also more variations for people who are not able to do the full range exercise would be better, only a few are shown. Also explanations about what is actually the essence of the specific exercise regarding breathing and not only movement explanations or naming the holds. That would make it easier  to adapt to your personal abilities.",1368057600,2,423,4.875
