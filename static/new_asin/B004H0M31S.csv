4374797,4,B004H0M31S,Six women are topless. One of them is topless multiple times. If there would have been some full frontals this would easily be a five star movie. Women have beautiful real breasts.,1453852800,3,180,4.65625
4374798,2,B004H0M31S,Ehhh... dated. A fee funny lines here and there but hardly a good movie to watch women. The women in this had no bodies to speak of (no good t & a) and no personalities. Not sexy in the least. It was more of a super soft core soft core B-movie.,1444089600,3,244,3.803921568627451

4374801,4,B004H0M31S,"I saw this move on a movie channel years ago and couldn't remember the name. Finally found it again and bought it. It is such am awful good, not awfully good, but awful good almost grindhouse type B movie. The special effects are really special as it the storyline and scenery. Very special. This movie is great for watching with friends and a view drinks or by yourself when you just don't want to think. I actually liked it.",1397952000,2,426,4.405063291139241

4374803,4,B004H0M31S,"Sugar Boxx is a good women in prison movie. Well, at least until the last ten or fifteen minutes, which is when it finally becomes a great women in prison movie. This movie is a homage to 70's exploitation and it succeeds with plenty of breasts, foul language, and camp. Sugar Boxx kinda rocks!",1300406400,4,294,4.462962962962963
4374804,4,B004H0M31S,"Director Cody Jarrett delivers a loving, heart-felt homage to the 70's grindhouse women-in-prison flicks so prevalent back then with his latest offering, 'Sugar Boxx', starring Geneviere Anderson and Thela Brown. All WIP flicks are blessed or cursed with pretty much the exact same plot, depending on your perspective and tolerance for the genre, and this one's a conveyor belt of clich&eacute;s, bless its exploitative little heart. I should know, I grew up with them, for better or worse. When I initially saw it had Tura Satana, Kitten Natividad and the godfather of blaxploitation films, Jack Hill, I thought it was a relic from the 70's that slipped under my radar. When I found out it was from 2010, I was somewhat letdown (way too many no-talent wannabes are riding that grindhouse tour bus into oblivion - again), but got my hands on a screener copy and had myself a rollicking goodtime. (Keep the potent potables handy to enrich your enjoyment, kids). It's not easy looking backwards while moving forwards at the same time, but Jarrett succeeds nicely here. 'Grindhouse' it's not, but it stands on its own merits regardless, especially when you consider the massively-imposed budgetary constraints.

The plot is directly 'borrowed' from an 'Emmanuelle' movie, those starring the luscious Laura Gemser - a female reporter asks her boss to pull strings to get her incarcerated in a notorious female prison - the Sugar State Women's Correctional Facility - to expose a corrupt law enforcement and judicial system that sets up young girls who are first-time offenders and sends them to a Florida Everglades penal colony few return from. Her boss refuses, so she decides to do it herself. She goes home at lunchtime to inform her lesbian partner of the news and has a little 'box lunch', before donning her hooker outfit and hits the road hard.

That night, she's pulled over by a seedy slimeball of a cop, and his partner plants a drug parcel in her trunk; before you know it, she's sexually assaulted and sent to Sugar State for seven years of 'hard' time by a time-hardened judge, the legendary Tura Satana (RIP-2011). Upon arrival at the prison, she's witness to a female inmate getting the taste of a bullwhip for a minor infraction. Naturally, the warden's a butchy lesbian 'Ilsa' type, but is willing to allow her to 'trade-up' and work a lite-prison detail during the week provided she's willing to flatback on the weekends at an in-house brothel for special 'guests', those of the political type with whom the warden's got some sweet financial fixings cooked up. Initially she says no, but after experiencing the grueling outside hard labor detail and the inhuman conditions that go hand in hand with this decision (along with Kitten Natividad, who time couldn't have been more unkind to, as the matronly supervisor, along with the male guards who use the women as Kleenix and pink puppets), she agrees to the warden's wicked ways, after another box lunch, that is. And that's when the real exploitation fun begins, friends, and never really lets up till the end credits roll.

The ace in the deck is Thela Brown, the ever-lovin' embodiment of all that was 70's bitchy blaxploitation bombshells, having all the best lines in the film and hands-down delivers the best performance here. She chews up everything in sight when she's on screen and helps make this flick the real deal in every way imaginable. She's got a filthy, foul mouth, perfect posturing of female blackness from that era, a take-no-prisoners attitude and more balls than any male in sight. She's fan-friggin-tastic. There's a cache of other lovelies of all denominations as additional eye-candy, which is much-needed when you see how the years have ravaged Tura (who starred in Russ Meyer's 'Faster, Pussycat, Kill, Kill!') and especially Kitten, who appeared in two Meyer films as well. Ouch.

There are no envelope-pushing, new standards set or boundaries broken here; director Cody Jarrett does a straight-up WIP vigilante / revenge parody that's stylistically true-to-form as it constantly unleashes hysterical dialogue and gratuitous nudity every few seconds, so it succeeds as exploitation skillfully and cleverly. Revenge is exacted by scantily-clad sluts with machetes and bullwhips and breasts, (oh my!) as we follow this yellow-brick road to ruin - it's an invigorating, magical moment in madhouse motion picture history.

There's also a cool making-of featurette, three different trailers worth a look-see and a 30 second Tura Satana tribute. If you're into these flicks (honestly, what red-blooded male isn't?), check into 'Sugar Boxx' - there's enough sweets here to cause cavities...",1300320000,20,4677,5.092568448500652
4374805,5,B004H0M31S,"Sugar Boxx is an INCREDIBLY entertaining, ass-kicking good time. It's at once a tribute, a hilarious sendup and a straight-forward take on 1970s B movies, particularly of the Russ Meyer variety. That said, I am far from being an aficionado of '70s ""sexploitation"" flicks. But I feel like anybody who liked the Rodriguez/Tarantino movie ""Grindhouse,"" or the same duo's vampire spoof ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" would like Sugar Boxx. It definitely has a lot of the same ingredients as those films, besides its influences - i.e., a campy plot (in this case about an undercover reporter in a rather, uh, sexy women's prison), great visuals, hot ladies, plenty of action - but the movie is not at all derivative. Sugar Boxx is a lot of fun, very true to its inspirations but also really tongue-in-cheek witty without being ironic. Two thumbs up!",1299974400,11,835,4.887323943661972
4374806,5,B004H0M31S,"Thanks to Grindhouse and Machete, lots of aspiring low budget filmmakers are dusting off old 70's drive-in exploitation genres and giving them a shot in the arm. Director Cody Jarrett's Sugar Boxx is a kickass, highly entertaining love letter to 70's Women in Prison pictures like The Hot Box, The Big Bird Cage, and The Big Doll House.  In fact, Big Bird Cage and Big Doll House director Jack Hill also has a cameo as a judge!  If that wasn't great enough, Russ Meyer fans will also be pleased to know that goddesses Kitten Natividad and the late Tura Satana also have small roles.  If you loved Tura in Faster Pussycat Kill Kill, you won't want to miss a chance to see her in her last role!

Sugar Boxx wears it's inspiration on it's sleeve, which is admirable, but it also backs it up by delivering on the exploitation goodies.  There is plenty of Women in Prison cliches (lesbianism, shower scenes, catfights, etc.) lovingly splashed across the screen and a good amount of T & A to keep fanatics of the genre happy.  And wait until you hear some of the hilarious dialogue!  I guarantee you'll be quoting lines from this movie for days.

In short, this is a must see for fans of Women in Prison movies, and exploitation films in general.  They say they don't make them like they used to. Sugar Boxx proves them wrong.",1299801600,4,1320,4.512605042016807
