8206543,5,B000SSETAG,"As a Grateful Dead, Beefheart and Counter culture fanatic I bought this with some trepidation after seeing some of the other reviews but it is a great audio visual document of Bickershaw. Its not a big budget Monterey style film . Its a collection of bits of rare cine and other archive film and stills of the festival. It is great",1293494400,,331,4.442622950819672
8206544,5,B000SSETAG,"I am keenly interested in 1970s festivals and unlike the other negative reviewers shown here I really enjoyed this historical archive dvd. The Garcia interview is brilliant. To see the short snatches of cine of the Dead playing is amazing and the general crowd footage and short snatches of band film mingled with audio gives you a feel of what made Bickershaw such a great festival. The slleve does explain this is
really a historic document / collection of ratre film rather than some epic Woodstock movie. For true followers of the hippie festival and counter culture of the 70's it is definitely worth getting",1293148800,,613,4.847619047619047
8206545,1,B000SSETAG,"This is utter garbage, an abomination of epic proportions.  Avoid the disapointment.  The audio and the video don't match at all.  I love all the bands, but unfortunately you don't get any real performances.  The people who marketed this as a concert video should be ashamed of themselves.  Apparantly the producers of this DVD are unfamiliar with the concept of shame.  They should be.  I bought this, and returned it the next day.",1280102400,2,432,4.835616438356165
8206546,1,B000SSETAG,"I just rented this for $[,[...] and I was quite excited. Excited to the degree that I went to Amazon to check if it was available BEFORE I even watched it. I'm watching it now and... wow. It's horrible. It's like a bad PowerPoint presentation with occasional video clips interspersed and REPEATED throughout.

WHOA. Some actual synchronized footage of Country Joe MacDonald playing an acoustic guitar in high winds! Bad audio, uninspired performance, cut off mid-song. Fab.

An on-camera interview with Jerry Garcia who's obviously bummed out about the weather and the facilities in general. He say ""festivals are an unfortunate circumstance to be playing in."" Hoo boy! Great shots of the amps... utter crap.

Overall POOR audio quality. Video is mostly lo-res stills and 2 second clips from multiple POOR sources--some of it from performances OTHER than this festival! What's the point of that?

By the way, we get about 30 second of live Beefheart. If it were on YouTube, you'd probably complain about the quality.

Don't even rent this. I'm going to ask for my $[...] back. Really.",1210118400,6,1084,5.0
8206547,3,B000SSETAG,"Some thirty plus years ago I entered a competition in a relatively new Brit music newspaper, Sounds, for tickets to a festival in Bickershaw, Lancashire and to my surprise won, along with my pal Dave. We sold one pair and with the proceeds bought bus tickets and off we jolly well went.

My main reason for going was to see the Grateful Dead, again, and in the end I was not to be disappointed.

What followed was three days of peace, love and music and dreadful weather which ended up in the site being a quagmire and freezing cold. Unlike Woodstock there are no pictures of people frolicking in the mud like happy hippy hippos but there are many of people huddled together for shared bodily warmth and also being very friendly.

I bought this DVD, at great expense (isn't the weak dollar not wonderful) more as a memento than as a movie and to that extent I was not disappointed. The DVD is like my memories of the festival bits here and bits there, shards of experiences both good and bad. It must be admitted that the quality is not good but then for those who were there the music was the important thing.

This DVD is probably not for the general viwere of fan or music lover but as a picture of a period of time, or for people like myself, a trip down memory lane, it is worth buying to show our kids or grandkids and for that reason alone I would recommend it.",1199577600,9,1368,4.311284046692607
8206548,1,B000SSETAG,"This is not a concert film, although it is certainly packaged to appear like one.  The warning sign is hidden in small type on the cover of this DVD: ""rare festival footage featuring extracts from the sets of...""  'Extracts' translates to a montage of still photographs, a few seconds of barely viewable film footage (mostly of the crowd), and audio that is muddy and unlistenable.  So sad, as there were some rarely-filmed acts at this festival, including Captain Beefheart's Magic band and Captain Beyond.

8206549,1,B000SSETAG,"The Bickershaw Festival DVD, at 30 bucks I might add, is an utter ripoff.

Either terrible or nonexistent camera work, terrible sound, repeated still shots instead of performances, shots from behind the artists, and concert footage that's not from the actual Bickershaw festival!  With the exception of Captain Beefheart, NOWHERE on the DVD packaging is it mentioned you won't be seeing complete live performances.  There's no footage of the Kinks at all!

I would never pay $30 to see crowd shots, marginally interesting interviews, and one garbled song per artist.

Avoid this DVD at all costs!  Get the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival instead.",1196208000,29,646,5.223300970873787
