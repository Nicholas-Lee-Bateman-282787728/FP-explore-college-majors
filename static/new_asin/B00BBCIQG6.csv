8565288,4,B00BBCIQG6,"This movie was filmed near my home in northwest Connecticut and it was fun seeing and hearing about local landmarks.  The story was a sad one about an accident, its victim and those whose love for her made a difference.  I probably wouldn't have watched it without the local connection but am so glad I did.",1377388800,,307,4.464285714285714

8565291,5,B00BBCIQG6,We were hoping this film would have made it into a cinema in NY but were disappointed it didn't. So we were thrilled to get the dvd copy and couldn't wait to watch it. All the previous reviews were correct. The film was compelling and the story line stays with you - I found myself thinking about the characters well after the movie finished. The story was unique and heartfelt and we thoroughly enjoyed the acting and characters. We also really enjoyed the sound track. We would highly recommend this movie.,1366070400,3,508,4.593406593406593
