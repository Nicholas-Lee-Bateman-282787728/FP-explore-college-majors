How about accepting a return and begin sending this series with English subtitles.  I have the all region dvd player - that was the warning.  No warning about Dutch only subtitles until I received the package.  We just opened it today which is a week over the return deadline.  Check our account and see if you really want to be stubborn about our return of this for credit.",1424995200,,489,4.438202247191011

8425104,5,B004DAUKYY,"My husband and I really enjoyed this series.  The stories were very diverse and kept you guessing. Each character had their flaws and problems, but did not let that interfere with fulfilling their duties.  Autopsies were very realistic and each episode had that surprise.  Great series.",1381968000,,286,5.173913043478261
