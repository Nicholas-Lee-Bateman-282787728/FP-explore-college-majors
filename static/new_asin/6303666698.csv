704348,3,6303666698,I taped this movie when I was young and look forward to watching it every Christmas. It's a very cute and sweet movie. I'm surprised that it has gotten bad reviews on Amazon. There is something about this movie that I absolutely love and I always look forward to watching it around Christmas time. It's just a cute Christmas special.,1055289600,,333,4.566666666666666
704349,3,6303666698,"An adult would find the uncreative plot, Giants with corny names (including one named Corny!), and bubbly songs particularly annoying.... but children (for whom this is intended, remember?) will love it.",1015545600,,203,5.580645161290323
7852906,5,6303666698,The movie is great.  It transports me back to my childhood.  It was wonderful to find this movie on DVD.  I've looked for years but have only found the movie on VHS.,1390176000,,165,4.09375
7852907,5,6303666698,This is an awesome kids' cartoon from the 1980's with original songs and a charming storyline.  I loved this when I was a child and my kids love it now.  It is NOT a Disney cartoon so don't expect it to be.  It is a neat twist to the original story showing Snow White and the Prince after they have gotten older and have a young child who is also named Snow White.  This is a story of a Christmas journey of the young Snow White.  It is great to be able to share this with my kids.  ;-),1386374400,,486,3.8585858585858586
7852908,3,6303666698,"I was totally in love wit this Christmas special when I was a child, and always remembered it. I wondered if I would ever see it again, and now thanks to YouTube and Amazon I can.

 However, looking back on it 30 years later, and my being much older, this story now seems so cheesy, and somewhat ridiculous. Any Snow White fan would love it, but the general public forgot this just as quickly as the Grinch Halloween Special. Unlike the immortal Charlie Brown Christmas, A Snow White Christmas is gone and mostly forgotten. For those of us who want to keep it for our memoirs, let's get it while it lasts.

 For myself, I loved the story for its child-like enchantment, but I was only 10 yrs old, and the world has changed so much since John Lennon was shot (the same month this tale came out in December 1980). But be it a book or a DVD, any story you treasure is valuable to you, and thus worth keeping. If you like Snow White, this is for you.",1313625600,2,946,4.238888888888889
7852909,3,6303666698,"I have fond memories of watching this Christmas special on TV as a very young child, so I was very excited when I learned that it was available on DVD. After watching ""A Snow White Christmas"" for the first time in about 25 years, I must confess that it's not exactly the animated masterpiece my five-year-old self proclaimed it to be. However, kids who are die-hard Snow White fans like me will love it. The story revolves around Snow White II, the daughter of the original Snow White and her now-husband, Charming. The Wicked Queen learns of little Snow White's existence and is determined to get rid of her. Poor Snow White is forced to go on the room with her impish friend, Grunyon, and they are befriended by the Seven Friendly Giants (distant cousins of the Seven Dwarfs), who help defeat the Wicked Queen right before Christmas.

Again, this is not brilliant animation in action by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a lot of sentimental value for me, and I'm happy to finally have it on DVD.",1238544000,4,1007,4.56353591160221
7852910,1,6303666698,"This was SO bad ... so cheesy,so tacky, so poorly done.  It was an embarrasment to poor Snow White's good name.  NOTHING even remotely close to the Disney movie.  Don't waste your time or your money!!",1229212800,,200,4.5
7852911,5,6303666698,This is the best sequal to Disney original 1930s Snow White classic ever done including having the wicked queen looking just like her classic self. The seven friendly giants are my favorite with their songs and their individual personalities like Disney did with the dwarfs.,1198454400,2,274,5.111111111111111
7852912,5,6303666698,I loved this x-mas special as a kid. I know it was never really popular but my dad taped a bunch of x-mas shows on a VHS and our family watched them every x-mas. Now at 26 I still have the video and watch it every x-mas season. This a great story of Snow White's daughter meeting the 7 friendly giants.,1194998400,,302,3.9672131147540983
7852913,5,6303666698,"Snow White marries Prince Charming and they live happily ever after!  That is, until they have a daughter and she becomes involved with the same wicked queen that tried to kill her mother!  Little Snow White escapes to a valley where she meets the 7 Giants - the cousins of the 7 Dwarfs!

When I was a child, I remember my mom and dad taping cartoons for me so I could watch them all the time.  My dad actually taped over Snow White Christmas in order to record the 1983 superbowl and it took about 20 years for me to forgive him!  I finally did when he found this cartoon on VHS from another online store a few years ago.  I'm happy to see that it's on Amazon but sad to see that it has gotten such bad reviews.  I love all the Rankin-Bass productions and this cartoon ranks right up there with those with me.  To me, it brings back memories of my childhood and the things I used to love when I was growing up.  If you saw this movie for the first time as an adult, it probably wouldn't have the same effect on you because YES, it is a children's movie.  I think you just have to have an open mind and forget trying to compare it to the Disney version of Snow White.  I hope they put this out on DVD soon!",1165622400,,1206,4.046413502109704
7852914,5,6303666698,"Although many adults may find this movie boring, corny and tacky, young children find this movie fun and interesting to watch. I show it to a number of groups of young children in the schools I substitute in. It should not be  literally compared with the earlier Disney version, since that was made forty  plus years before this one. It can be contrasted and viewed as a continuation of Snow White's life story.

 I think this movie can be  used to teach young children about growing up, getting married, and having a family.  Snow White as a mother  and  King (Prince) Charming as a father may be hard  for older Snow White fans to accept, but young children will see it as a natural phase in life. The seven friendly giants (the dwarf's cousins) can be used to teach values such as honesty, and compassion.

 I think this film has educational value and should be shown on TV more often during the holiday season.",1134950400,2,914,4.512195121951219
