2922275,5,B000UL0BHQ,Hogan fans will love this thorough going over of the great man's swing. It is a good swing and well worth copying as much as possible. If you want to work on a swing of this nature then get this. I think that this is one of the best Hogan packages on the market.,1354752000,,262,3.8703703703703702
2922276,1,B000UL0BHQ,"Is anyone still interested in this garbage?  The first couple of seasons weren't too bad, but they've gotten pretty boring.  Way too much fictitious ""drama"" and way too little actual bike building. Temper tantrums and destructive behavior ain't gettin' it for me.  People need to realize that we made these clowns and it's long past time to unmake them!",1342224000,,353,4.9491525423728815
2922277,5,B000UL0BHQ,"Five episodes from early season 6 are included on one DVD:

1. NHL Bike / B-2 Bomber Bike
2. Woodstock Bike / Ringling and Barnum and Bailey Circus Bike
3. Unique Machine Bike
4. 10th Anniversary OCC Bike
5. Teutul Triumph Bike

Great for fans of American Chopper.  Hopefully they will release more episodes or offer a complete collection at some point, but this DVD is a great start!",1284940800,4,384,4.536231884057971
2922278,2,B000UL0BHQ,"This is a thrown together DVD.  Definitely not sanctioned by Kiss.  About half of the DVD doesn't have the members of Kiss speaking into a microphone, you can't hear them.  There is a couple of interviews where you can hear them.  For the price, this isn't bad, especially if you collect Kiss items.  Definitely not for those who want Kiss music.",1238976000,,346,4.60655737704918
2922279,2,B000UL0BHQ,this might be a must have for Kiss Fans but it only consist of interviews from TV if you like this kind of thing.,1231286400,4,113,3.75

2922281,1,B000UL0BHQ,"I HAVE all of these!!  Why the heck do they keep making these ""Collectors Editions"" with the same darn episodes!!  I want to see season 4 and UP episodes.  I agree with other comments about that. WHY NOT MAKE SEASONS!!  Other shows are done that way.  STUPID shows have seasons, why can't an entertaining Icon like THIS one have seasons?!!!!",1214179200,,341,4.616666666666666
2922282,5,B000UL0BHQ,"ok, paramount, clearly the busiest company out there to continue on with new releases of great shows. so all these useless, worthless irritating garbage piles of cheap stupid compilations and best of this that and the other thing. WOULDNT IT BE EASIER, FASTER, LESS COSTLY AND SIMPLIFIED AND CLEAN AND IN ORDER BYYYYYYY THE SEASONNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!????????!!!!!!! the first few seasons are great, but the mid/late 60s ones have some really cool, groovie ones with hippies and even more lavish wild plots. i want it by the season! those idiots should have done it by the season from the get-go! my word to those who break up shows into useless compilation junk, what-a-lemon.",1211673600,3,678,5.117117117117117
2922283,2,B000UL0BHQ,"This collection of footage and interviews is a ""must have"" for any Hogan devotee.

The footage includes movies from Darracort's camera, familar to many, previously available film clips from other sources that have been pieced together, and much new footage never before seen. The commentary by McClean, Ballard, Toski, Harmon and others is incisive.",1197331200,,349,5.462962962962963

8213679,5,B000UL0BHQ,"Item was listed by the seller in ""good"" condition and came brand new and unopened, very pleased with the price and for Roy Rogers fans this is an excellent set of some of his better movies. It is the best collection I can find online and for an affordable price, well worth it.",1401062400,2,277,4.245283018867925

8213682,5,B000UL0BHQ,"Known to be possibly the best golfer of all time, Ben Hogan's swing is a beautiful thing to watch. Studying his motion will definitely improve your game. With the additional assistance of Jim McLean breaking down all the building blocks of Hogan's swing, you just can't go wrong.",1374710400,,279,4.833333333333333
8213683,3,B000UL0BHQ,"I'm thinking this program ran it's course. American Chopper ran until it apparently made the entire family wealthy and continued until junior no longer wanted to play along. Somewhat sad, really.

I wanted to see the program through the end to know how everything would turn out.  I'm guessing the answer to that question was somewhat dissappointing and actually leaves one hanging.

Very short season, apparently the result of nothing left for the producers to say. Seems success does spoil all.",1374710400,,496,5.098765432098766
8213684,5,B000UL0BHQ,Our family searches almost weekly for movies with character based stories.  My grandchildren get so excited watching Roy Rogers and cheer him on when he is setting things straight. I highly recommend these movies.,1359504000,3,213,5.264705882352941
