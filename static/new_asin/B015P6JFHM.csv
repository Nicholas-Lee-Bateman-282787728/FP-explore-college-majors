7445592,5,B015P6JFHM,"I was initially intrigued enough to purchase a DVD by the cast list: Entourage's Adrian Grenier, Drea De Matteo and Selma Blair (great in ""Hellboy""). O.K., the title was certainly different, too! This is a well-written and directed story about how family gets split apart over the years, as people ""grow"" and how things reconnect when a tragic even occurs (I'll avoid any spoilers, here).

At the very beginning of the film, things appear to be headed toward a documentary about Earl Anthony and his bowling career, but the film quickly turns to the real story of how a young man is rejected by his father and how he moves away to become a successful fashion designer, hardly speaking to his father or the rest of his family, until tragedy brings him and the rest of the clan back together, again.

You will undoubtedly shed a few tears during this wonderful movie, but the ending will have you smiling!",1450396800,5,903,4.672955974842767

8734222,5,B015P6JFHM,"Ally Walker (Profiler, Longmire) wrote and directed this heartfelt film about a very difficult subject: dying. While it only touches on the horrors of dying from a dread disease, the reality of family stress is carefully detailed. And the question of whats happens after death is creatively depicted through the eyes of 11-year-old Eli McAllister (Joshua Rush) as he tries to understand where his father will go when he dies.

He begins his search for the afterlife by visiting a priest, although he grew up Methodist. Eli is concerned that God will condemn his father for his military service where presumably he killed enemy soldiers. Would purgatory give his dad a chance to make amends? He then talks with a Hindu about reincarnation. His grandmother tells him a beautiful Native American story about shooting stars being people given a second chance at life. Can his father be one of those?

He asks his uncle about the notable Einstein quote: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, rather, it transforms from one form to another. His uncle Sean (played by Adrian Grenier) isn't religious, but tries to comfort the boy.

Sean has issues of his own. He is a famous designer who happens to be gay. Apparently he scandalized his family (small town) by kissing another boy in the locker room in high school. He hasn't visited his family in six years because hard feelings continue to exist between him and his sports jock father who just cant accept his son as he is.

Elis father (played by Bailey Chase formerly of Longmire) has a tough roleall done flat on his back, but is convincing as the doomed war hero and athletic champion, envied by many. Why did he survive war only to come home to relative safety to die so horribly and maybe without honor?

But it is Selma Blair who delivers a spot-on performance as the helpless wife who is watching her beloved slip away. She resents the hospice nurse who keeps her husband under the influence to control his pain which also keeps him from talking with her and friends and family. The stress of coping with a situation that is totally out of her control is intuitively played out here.

Beyond the claustrophobic room where the dying is taking place is a local bowling tournament that Elis grandfather (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is involved in. He owns the towns sports store. But hes handling his sons imminent death by refusing to see him.

Winning the tournament becomes a symbol to Eli. If they can win the big game maybe his dad can win too? He promises to bring the trophy back to his father. But even in bowling there are injuries and setbacks. It is unclear if the team can even play, let alone win.

And the minutes tick by as his father fades away.

Sex, Death and Bowling is a well done glimpse into a life scenario that is unavoidable by most families. Walker handles it deftly and with realism.",1469318400,,2857,4.664015904572564
8734223,5,B015P6JFHM,"An amazing story, happy and sad, but true to life and unfortunate human nature.  I have watched it multiple times and Eli, such an adorable little boy and very well acted out from such a young actor.

8734226,5,B015P6JFHM,"Sex, Death and Bowling struck a quiet, but lovely, major seventh chord with me.

Its not the kind of movie thats going to cause Iron Man or Batman to get weak in the knees. But I heard the major seventh chord.

Theres a lot about life and death and reincarnation in the movie, and along those lines, I thought itd be interesting to briefly explain how I got to the movie. Its just a string of things, none of them related, but they all served in a way to bring me here.

Ally Walker, the director, spent time in Santa Fe. My wife and I spent time in Santa Fe and found it lovely and spiritual.

My wife and I were fans of Ms. Walkers TV show, The Profiler.

Not too long ago, my wife died of breast cancer. Next came Longmire, a TV show (and series of books) about a lawman that lost his wife to cancer. Ironically, the books are set in Wyoming (where my wife and I married), but the TV show is shot in the Santa Fe area.

To keep my point progressing, just last year Ms. Walker took a role on the show. And it was because of that show, in a bizarre way, that I learned of this movie. A second-or-third hand thing led me to it. All random things. But they led me here.

At first, I wasn't going to watch the movie. You see, I watched my wife die in hospice, and I know the drip-drip-drip of morphine. I know how sad it is, but I know the peace there is. I know the conflicts with religion and family. I know the pain of possible loss, and the crippling pain of actual loss. Could I go through that again?

Like Eli, the 11-year-old son in the movie, I wondered about the afterlife. I sought out professionals, from priests to atheists, from doctors to people on the street.

Specifically as to the movie, it perhaps tried to juggle too many balls (including a bowling ball). But impending death is never a straight-line story. Its never simple. There are varying emotions. Theres sadness but also laughter. Theres anger and regret. Some bubbles out of nowhere. Some comes from the past. There will be some questions for which there will be no answers.

I wrote a book about my wife (Flying Geese and the Hope Dogs), and I know from that experience that its difficult to articulate everything that goes along with death. I find it interesting that Ms. Walker wrote the screenplay. I wonder why? I also note that Ms. Walker adapted a Native American story into the overall story. It was beautifully rendered. For years, my wife and I studied Native American tales about the raven and coyote, and those stories keep coming back to me.

This is a slow movie, and I mean nothing critical by that. Sometimes it pays to be slow. This movie is a slow simmer, and though it never reaches full boil, it still is satisfying.

A couple of quick things: I was also worried about the bowling part of the movie. Now, years ago, I bowled, so I know its not the most scintillating sport out there. But the bowling worked. (And it wasn't as boring as bowling can be.) I think the bowling, in fact, is where an answer came for one of Elis questions.

I think this makes a good movie for a family with kids to sit down and watch. There are other topics that come up in it. Some might be good conversation starters.

Also: theres some really nice music in it.

A major seventh chord is what I heard and saw.

Thank you, Ally Walker.",1461024000,2,3311,4.290529695024077
