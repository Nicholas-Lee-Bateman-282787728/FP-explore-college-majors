While I note that all of the songs on it were originally found in Music Express, this is a great collection of those. I'm looking forward to your next.",1401840000,,262,3.8703703703703702

I ordered the Decades of Dance DVD a few years back, and I have loved using it and my students really enjoy it.  I assumed that I would get something similar from this DVD but I was wrong.

First of all, he doesn't explain the individual dance moves - you are just stuck following what he does.  This isn't easy for adults, let alone young kids.  And the music is definitely geared toward that age group.

Second, he performs the dances in front of a green screen, which tends to distort his arms so that they look as thin as noodles!

Finally, this DVD seems to be a bit of a response to his appearance on the Ellen show and his video of ""Planet Rock"" going viral on YouTube.  Most people who don't work with kids would be pretty put off by his cheesiness.  I am usually not, but this goes a little too far!  Even my second graders would think this was too silly for them.

Not his finest work (not even close!), and I'm wishing I had spent that money differently. :(",1316995200,,1071,4.247524752475248
