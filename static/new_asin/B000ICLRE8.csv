8144886,1,B000ICLRE8,"This documentary states Turkey had the first city ... Which is very untrue as Egypt and India had much older cities ... Infact these two cities and Mesopotamia had the moat ancient cities .. it is sad that the British media is relentless about this Euro centrism and scary how much they hide the Dravidian history which is as old and bigger than Egypt .
Indian maths and science and philosophies influenced Europe heavily .. In ancient times the Europeans went to India to study these topics
Another error is that the doc says that jade was revered in the east ... They failed to say that in India which is the most ancient and influential culture in Asia... Gold was much more revered ...",1384905600,,689,4.52
