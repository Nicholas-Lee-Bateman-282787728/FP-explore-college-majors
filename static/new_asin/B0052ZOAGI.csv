8454878,2,B0052ZOAGI,"I previously ordered ""Farm Boy Tom's"" DVD from this producer and was very happy with it. This one was disappointing due to poor production and editing. Also, the model is uncircumcised which I find off-putting. It would be nice if the quality was consistent from one to another of this series, but it seems from my experience and other reviews like it is hit or miss with this producer.",1335398400,3,386,4.608695652173913
