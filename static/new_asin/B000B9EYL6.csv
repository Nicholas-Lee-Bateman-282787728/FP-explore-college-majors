8089213,5,B000B9EYL6,"My 2 year old daughter loves Dooley. We travel to visit family ever other month (6 hour trip) and we entertain her with a DVD player and her favorite shows and sometimes she asks ""Dooley on, Please"". I didn't have the DVD until recently. I was looking on the internet for Dooley DVDs and found that they are out of print. I found them on ebay but the bids were up to 100 bucks. I'm thankful to have found them on Amazon at a resonable price. Now when she asks for Dooley, I can put a smile on her little face. Thanks. DVD arrived in perfect condition and played well.",1255305600,2,567,4.163636363636364
