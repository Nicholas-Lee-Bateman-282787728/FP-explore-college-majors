2437742,3,6304551584,For a Indie Film it's pretty good.. The blonde girl with those stockings is HOT. Funny Horror the Celery stuffed down the throat is my fav. hehe,951091200,,144,4.37037037037037
8091087,4,6304551584,I purchased this on VHS nearly 15 years ago back when Fangoria first ran ads promoting this and Generation Ax. If memory serves correct - Crinoline Head was free with the purchase of Generation Ax. Hands down the best $19 (or whatever) I spent as a teen. Even now in 2016 I still quote these films. For me this and Ax are pure nostalgia in the vein of Goonies and other 80s classics.,1469059200,,383,4.260273972602739
8091088,5,6304551584,Love it!,1442966400,,8,3.5
8091089,4,6304551584,I like low budget because there also fans like us who watch these movies Tommy faircloth did a great job with this the legend of crinoline head comes true and he starts killing people off type of movie where you want the characters to die love it when one dies in the toilet face in poop heard where they made a part 2 Hope it comes out soon.,1436832000,,342,4.044117647058823
8091090,4,6304551584,"Cannot believe I missed this one in the 90's, awesome slasher flick. Really looking forward to the release of the sequel, Dorchester's Revenge. Give this one a whirl for an underrated slasher.",1423353600,2,192,5.03125
8091091,5,6304551584,"Crinoline Head had me grinning from ear to ear for a large portion of its running time. It's very funny at times, but it's also a loving homage to 80's slasher movies. Like another reviewer stated, this film really reminded me of the Sleepaway Camp series. It has the same twisted sense of humor mixed with original death scenes. It could have been called Sleepaway Camp 4. See it!",1392854400,2,381,4.536231884057971
8091092,4,6304551584,"It was awesome. It can rub people the wrong way, but it's meant as more of a spoof. It's obvious the director was hugely influenced by John Waters.",1384819200,2,147,4.285714285714286
8091093,1,6304551584,"I couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes before shutting it off. The acting was annoying and horrible. Maybe it got better, but I couldn't stand it anymore.",1378771200,,164,4.689655172413793
8091094,5,6304551584,"Awesome!  I love this movie.  It's so reminds me of Sleepaway Camp.  Very campy and very fun!  If you like the 80's and you like horror, you will like this!  Shot on film is a plus!",1373328000,2,181,3.9166666666666665
8091095,5,6304551584,"I saw this movie back in 2000 when I read about it in Fangoria and I am so glad it's finally out on DVD!  If you like the old horror movies like Sleepaway Camp then you will like this one.  Is it the best movie ever? No, but movies like this are not supposed to be.  I enjoyed the John Waters like humor mixed with the Friday the 13th type story.  It's amazing what you can do with no budget and good acting.  I can't wait for part 2!!",1366243200,2,435,3.842696629213483
8091096,5,6304551584,"i bought this by mailorder knowing nothing about it, based on the fact that everready did the soundtrack. there's even a tiltwheel video after the outtakes. sweet.
