8123723,5,B000FJH51I,"I have this DVD for more than 10 years now, and it is one of my favorite exercise videos.
I have done Pilates for 7 years (instructed in class) and also dance as a hobby and am a touch therapist,
And still, through the years, this has been one of the most relaxing, restoring and rehabilitating exercise i know.
I consider this DVD a friend for times when i need alignment or gentle and balanced fitness which will really do me good..
The instructor is one of the charming a pleasant women i ever sow...

In summery, i recommend this to anyone who want to do Pilates, beginners or experienced.",1406937600,,593,4.390909090909091
8123724,4,B000FJH51I,"This 45-minute workout will help you forget the worries and distractions of everyday life. While it will challenge your core and your balance, it provides a supportive atmosphere that will enable you to have the intense focus necessary to meet that challenge.

The DVD is filmed on the beach and has a tranquil but energizing atmosphere. The music is unobtrusive, but has a gently pulsing rhythmic quality that supports your movements. Katalin is a great role model for maintaining good focus. She is serious and her instructions are simple and clear. There is absolutely nothing to distract you in this workout...no joking, no distracting workout wear, and no cheesecake supermodel personality.

The 30-minute standing section has familiar ballet moves such as leg lifts, leg beats, leg circles and swings, followed by  combinations of these steps that add arm movements, weight shifts, curtsies and lunges. You will need to maintain an intense focus in order to follow this while staying balanced.

Katalin provides lots of cues on good posture, reminding you to pull your rib cage down toward your hips, to lengthen the body toward the ceiling through the crown of your head, and to engage the abdominals and the gluts. Her breathing cues are particularly good. In addition to TELLING you to breathe, she audibly models the pilates technique of exhaling on the exertion that is so important in this type of workout.

The 15-minute floorwork section is also done on the beach and Katalin continues to model pilates breathing technique. It includes side-lying postures with leg brushes, leg lifts, pulses, etc.

My only criticism of this DVD--and the reason I gave it four stars--is that it does not include any cool-down stretches to release the tension built up during all of that hard work.",1265500800,3,1794,5.064406779661017
8123725,5,B000FJH51I,Thsi DVD pilates workout is just right.  it is not difficult to follow and you still see results.  After a few months I noticed my hips looked slimmer and my legs felt stronger.  I really enjoy the pace and length of the DVD.,1256083200,2,225,4.186046511627907
8123726,5,B000FJH51I,This is a great workout - it adds a little fun and variety to the standard pilates workout,1234828800,,90,4.055555555555555
8123727,5,B000FJH51I,"I cannot not say enough positive things about this dvd. The instructor is excellent! She is not annoying and her cues are easy to follow. The exercises are easy to follow but you will definitely feel sore the next day. This is a mixture of ballet, standing and floor pilates. If you like pilates, then I would get this dvd.",1223424000,,323,4.4
8123728,2,B000FJH51I,"i BOUGHT THIS DVD LOOKING FOR A PILATES WORKOUT, I OWN THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET WORKOUT 1 &2, ALSO THE BALLET BOOT CAMP 2 DVD, I'VE BEEN ALTERNATING THESE DVDS FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. THE PILATES FUSION LACKS OF CARDIO WORKOUT AND THE WARM UP SECTION, THE EXCERSISES ARE PRETTY EASY TO FOLLOW, THE AB SECTION IS THE ONLY GOOD PART IN THIS DVD.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BALLET FUSION FORGET IT, IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TECHNIQUE OF CLASSICAL BALLET AND THE POSITIONS AND STEPS AREN'T WELL PERFORMED.
I WOULN'T RECOMMEND THIS DVD OVERALL, THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES FOR HOME WORKOUTS.",1207094400,5,571,4.553398058252427
8123729,4,B000FJH51I,"Rebecca wrote a great review on this dvd on old title: ""The Method: Standing Pilates Blend"".
I tried this since I loved Katalin in her ""The Method - Meditation Through Movement"" video which I wrote a review for saying she has incredible form & presence, but the pace was a bit slow & too easy for me. She has great body awareness & calm, natural demeanor. I bought her old VHS G.I. Jabb martial arts videos because of her incredible energy/form in it that I saw on her site katalinusa com.

This video's menu only gives the options of the 2 chapter choices of the standing/balance leg work of 30 min & her mat work of 15 min, along with only a quick text bio of Katalin's extensive martial arts accomplishments & other fitness extensive training. The choice of not being able to do w/o the music is a poor choice since the music was so light w/a slow tempo, it put me to sleep. When my heater fan kicked in drowning it out, I enjoyed the workout much more.

Floor work - 30 min - was straight ballet with some lunges, plies, curtsy style drops. She puts it into combos like leg circles, lunge, leg lift forward, backward then down. It's all about balance & ability to stand on one leg. Though I loved that help with grace, I found it repetitive.
Mat work - 15 min - almost no crunches, some leg lifts & drops, a hundred was done, but in sets of 4 pulses then rest, then 4 pulses... the yoga bridge was done very quickly, then a lot of side lying w/more ballet style leg toning.

While I bought this because it wasn't straight pilates & enjoyed the ballet movements, I found the pace to be a bit slow & too easy for me. She allows rests in between & modifies things such as the hundred. I did feel my muscles work for toning, but I already have incredible balance from years of yoga. I did not do it as gracefully as they did, but on a first try, I was close. This is because of Katalin's awesome cuing & reminders of good posture/alignment. She also puts great emphasis on when to inhale/exhale which was great. She also tries to cue YOUR left & right.
This video is for beginners, those with limited balance ability, or those who are die hard ballet fans. This can also be used for toning for a lazy day for those who work out regularly. I will thank Katalin, because by following her cues, I did feel more comfortable, relaxed, & really did the moves more correctly then I do on regular ballet dvd workouts.

If you like this style, I would recommend ""New York City Ballet"" which is better for intermediates with good balance. If you're looking for something that will whip your butt that's a blend of ballet, pilates, dance, balance, I'd suggest Kari Anderson's ""Angles, lines & curves"" I or II & her ""Reach""

8123730,3,B000FJH51I,"I was given this as a gift and I could not get past the picture on the box. If I wanted to show an example of bad alignment and form - this is the pose I would strike. It makes me assume that the makers do not think proper alignment is essential which sets the exerciser up not only for an ineffective workout with an unbeautiful result, but possibly injury as well.",1176768000,4,366,4.097222222222222
8123731,1,B000FJH51I,"The workout is pretty good! But this is exactly the same workout ""Pilates Standing Blend"" with Katalin Zamiar.",1176249600,18,110,5.166666666666667
