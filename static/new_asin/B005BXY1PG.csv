4649143,4,B005BXY1PG,"We are huge superhero fans at Imaginerding HQ. With the rebirth, so to speak, of the Marvel Universe with the Iron Man film, we have seen every film and collected the DVDs.

Much like the first season, we found the stories to be engaging, exciting and educational. Yes, I said educational. We were able to use the DVDs as a starting point to talk about Norse Mythology and how we have run into these same gods, goddesses and stories in other media. I was surprised that my twelve year-old was as captivated by the stories as my eight year-old. Whenever the story talked about Yggdrasil or the nine realms, we were reminded of the amazing book series by Michael Scott, the Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel.

The second season brings Loki's plan to fruition that began in the first season. You can still enjoy Volumes Three and Four without watching the previous two, but I would urge you to watch the whole series for the stories and the arc. Both seasons are a great interim while waiting for the release of the Avengers movie in 2012. They add a lot of depth to the existing film franchise and fans of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor will revel in the back stories and character development.

The voice acting was very well done and the animation was a notch above most superhero animated series that we have seen. These two volumes represent the story arc of the second season of the Disney XD series.

Although the final episode ties up the Loki story nicely, there is a surprise cliff hanger that leaves us waiting for Season Three.

4649144,3,B005BXY1PG,"Volume one and two of the Avengers are excellent and very well done, particularly in remaining true to the original comic characterizations of these heroes!  However, if you are a Thor or Hulk fan (like me) you will be dissapointed as Volumes 3 & 4 reduce these powerful heroes to merely back up roles in favor of Ironman, likely due to his live action box office successes, and essentially equalizes all the characters to the ""team concept."" Obviously, Thor and Hulk are the only members who have the true superpowers, but this is dramtically played down in each episode.  Otherwise, good series and I do recommend it for all Marvel fans.",1316304000,2,639,4.747747747747748
4649145,5,B005BXY1PG,"One of the best series to come out of the marvel universe in awhile. In this version the heroes are Captain America,Ant Man,Hulk,Hawkeye,Iron Man,Thor and the Black panther. This makes up a colorful team of superheroes. the Creators did a fantastic job of bringing plenty of the Marvel Villains to lite. Many of the story's include Hydra,Aim,Shield and other 1 time superheroes who will both be with and against the Avengers. I have the whole Series on my Ps3 and all I can tell you if you want a fast pace story's (which seems like the heroes never get time to rest.) Exciting villains and and great plots this is the series for you. Oh and it has the Hulk. Nuff said.",1316217600,,669,4.491803278688525
4649146,5,B005BXY1PG,"In the past it would have been impossible for me to title a review as I have this one. There have been competent Marvel projects (such as X-Men and Spider-Man in the early 90's), but never anything that captures the silver-age joy of my childhood quite like the excellently written and animated Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. May the upcoming live action production show the same respect to the great comic book source material as this program does.

This series does not fall into any of today's common traps, like desperately trying to make its characters ""cooler"" for today's generation, skimping on animation and voicework, or plodding through anecdotal one-villain-at-a-time plots. The show has a brilliantly defined story arc and keeps track of all the moving parts that feed it. Every action and reaction by hero and villain alike contributes to something bigger, key details are intriguing and never left dangling, and the dialogue is spot on. These are absolutely and without exception the characters I enjoyed reading Avengers comics in elementary school.

Volume 4 includes epic Ultron and Asgard multi-part stories. It does not get much better than that.

4649147,5,B005BXY1PG,"The Avengers Assemble for more fun and adventure as volumes 3 and 4 are now coming out.

If you want or love action and adventure, don't miss the latest volumes of Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Here are the episodes in this volume.

1. The Casket of Ancient Winters-An evil dark elf finds the Casket of Ancient Winters, an artifact that unleashes eternal winter on the planet. The only ones who can handle the elf's magic are Thor and Iron Man, who must put aside their different beliefs and take down the evil elf.

2. Hail, Hydra!-Hydra and AIM are waging war against one another in the streets of New York, and only one person knows why... the Black Widow. She knows that AIM has created the ultimate weapon for Hydra, a weapon so powerful that M.O.D.O.C. wants it for himself. It's called the Cosmic Cube, and to touch it is to change the world. But the Avengers have another problem... they've just been grounded by S.H.I.E.L.D., now under the control of Maria Hill.

3. Ultron-5-Ant-Man has had enough of the violence and endless fighting so he quits. But something goes terribly wrong and now Ultron may be the very last villain the Avengers confront. Thor even accidentely gets banished back to Asgard but the Avengers don't know it.

4. Ultron Imperative-As the devastated team struggles with the loss of Thor, Ant-Man and Iron Man go about destroying all remnants of Ultron. But they don't realize that Ultron has transcended his body and has infiltrated the world's computer systems.

5. This Hostage Earth-As Thor and Iron Man work to find a way to return Thor to Asgard, the Enchantress and the Masters of Evil make their move and mobilize all over the world, preparing for an invasion the likes of which Earth has never seen.

6. The Fall of Asgard-Lost and separated, the Avengers struggle to survive in the nine realms of Asgard. But with Loki sitting on Odin's throne, Thor defeated and Iron Man's armor not functioning, what chances do they have?

7. A Day Unlike Any Other-The Avengers prepare for the adventure and their ultimate battle as they form an alliance with Sif and other beings of Asgard as they confront the treacherous god Loki. What chances do the Avengers have against a god and his god-like allies? This will be a battle the Avengers will never forget.",1312070400,37,3329,4.876106194690266

4649192,5,B005BXY1PG,"THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 4: THORS LAST STAND collects together episodes 15-26 of the first season of The Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes tv series. These are the final seven episodes of the first season of the tv series. The episodes do a good job of combining old school references to the original comic book heroes with a post-modern sensibility. In the first two volumes in the series (HEROS ASSEMBLE! and CAPTAIN AMERICA REBORN!), the episodes worked ok as stand-alone episodes. Thats not really the case anymore, but a brief prologue showing relevant events from previous episodes really helps out. The animation isn't bad: it's not Pixar, but it is a step above animated tv action shows from the 1980s, e.g. G.I. JOE. The seven episodes in THE AVENGERS: THORS LAST STAND are:

20. The Casket of Ancient Winters  the dark elf Malekith unleashes an ancient Asgardian artifact, the Casket of Ancient Winters, to bring an eternal winter to Earth in attempt to bring his people back to rule over their new home: Earth (Midgard).

21. Hail, Hydra!  Hydra and A.I.M. are at war because A.I.M. has succeeded in created a cosmic cube. Black Widow calls on the Avengers for assistance. However, they have another problem: S.H.I.E.L.D. which is now under the control of Maria Hill.

22. Ultron-5  Ant-Man leaves the Avengers, but not before his A.I. security droid, Ultron malfunctions. Ultron believes that humanity is a virus and must be eradicated. In the midst of fighting Ultron, Thor disappears.

23. The Ultron Imperative  trying to cope with the loss of Thor, Ant-Man and Iron Man destroy the physical remains of Ultron. However, unbeknownst to the Avengers, Ultron has downloaded his consciousness into the worlds computer systems.

24. This Hostage Earth  the Masters of Evil plan to use ancient Asgard powers to help them conquer Earth. But when the plan backfires and the ancient stones the Masters of Evil were using are destroyed, the Avengers are scattered to the nine realms of the universe.

25. The Fall of Asgard  the nine realms are under siege by Loki and the Avengers are scattered. They unite with resistance forces and forge their way to Asgard to confront Loki.

26. A Day Unlike Any Other  the Avengers and the Asgardian resistance confront Loki.

I'm not sure why the first season was broken down into four sets, but I really enjoyed THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 4: THORS LAST STAND and can't wait to see what happens in season two. Hopefully, season two will be contained in one set instead of in four different volumes

4649205,5,B005BXY1PG,"While I believe it is part for the money, these disks are already being produced on Dual Layer DVD's holding aroundnd 6GB per disk.  They are delivering high quality and would still have to charge you as a box price set even if they sold them together.  This way you can wait for the box set or pay a CHEAPER amount for just one disk if that is all you need.  You also get the earlier sets before you would get the complete.

Anyway, great show, my four year old literally won't stop singing the theme song.  Worth the buy for Avengers fans youg and old (I Like it Too).

4649207,5,B005BXY1PG,"""To the mightiest heroes in the Nine Realms! Hail, Avengers!"" And this coming from Odin the All-Father. Not too shabby. AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES! Vol. 4: THOR'S LAST STAND collects episodes #20-26, the final seven of the hugely entertaining Season One. This volume tracks two main arcs revolving around, respectively, Ultron and Loki.

- Episode #20 - ""The Casket of Ancient Winters""
- Episode #21 - ""Hail, Hydra!""
- Episode #22 - ""Ultron-5""
- Episode #23 - ""The Ultron Imperative""
- Episode #24 - ""This Hostage Earth""
- Episode #25 - ""The Fall of Asgard""
- Episode #26 - ""A Day Unlike Any Other""

This is a rousing way to end a season that's been habitually graced with bold storytelling, blistering action, and spectacular animation, as well as frequent respectful nods to Marvel comics mythos. I appreciate the way the stories don't only focus on the more powerful figures on the team. The brash Hawkeye and the cool, majestic Black Panther also get opportunities to shine and strut their stuff. I really get a kick out of the Wakandian monarch showing off his hi-tech Wakandan arsenal. ""The Casket of Ancient Winters"" furthers the Enchantress's plot and has the sinister dark elf, Malakith the Accursed, activating an ancient Asgardian artifact to usher in an everlasting global winter on Earth. This episode also finds Thor and Iron Man at odds. Thor damns science for the many times it's generated crisis after crisis for the Avengers, but then Stark gets his smug on when the team learns the source of the icy storm raging about them. In ""Hail, Hydra!"" the Avengers are caught in a war between A.I.M. and Hydra over the reality-bending Cosmic Cube, and Hawkeye sort of gains a measure of closure with the whole Black Widow betrayal mess.

I think we all got that same sinking feeling when we saw the Ultrons being utilized as prison sentries some episodes ago, right? In ""Ultron 5"" and ""The Ultron Imperative"" Ant Man's cybernetic child evolves beyond his creator's benevolent programming. Oh, Ultron 5 is still working towards fulfilling Hank Pym's dream of achieving peace on Earth... but by bringing about the extinction of humanity. As a longtime reader of Marvel, I am not at all surprised. Ant Man is simply not model parenting material. Thing is, this is only one aspect of Pym's inherently flawed character. Odds are, this cartoon series probably won't even go near the infamous storyline in which Pym slaps the hell out of Janet.

Season One culminates with the three-part epic featuring Loki, diabolical God of Mischief (""God of Mischief"" makes it seem like he's only sneaking whoopie cushions on people's seats; dude's a wee bit more evil than that). With the All-Father in the embrace of the Odinsleep, Loki has wrested the throne of Asgard and declared himself ruler of the Nine Realms. In a monolithic, biting-off-more-than-they-can-chew gesture, the Avengers storm the halls of Asgard in a desperate bid to overthrow Loki. But even the Avengers - but one - are mere mortals defying insanely powerful and immortal gods. It must be a Wednesday.

All along, there has been foreshadowing of the impending interstellar war between the Kree and the Skrulls. This promises to come to fruition somewhen in Season Two, which gets underway with ""The Private War of Dr. Doom,"" an episode reportedly featuring the egoed-up Latverian monarch and his nemesis, the Fantastic Four. Can't wait.

The DVD's bonus feature: ""Avengers Unmasked: Hail, Hyrdra! - an animated in-episode comic book experience loaded with fun facts on Marvel's Avengers and the Villains that challenge them."" Basically, the episode ""Hail, Hydra!"" is shown picture-in-picture whilst trivia facts pop up in caption format.",1321833600,,3710,5.034201954397394
4649208,4,B005BXY1PG,"Even though studios other than Disney, who owns Marvel, have their names on the recent hit live action movies based on the characters (Captain America, Thor, etc.), Disney owns the licenses and is now releasing some of most recent animated TV episodes featuring Iron Man, X-Men, and The Avengers.

Volumes 1 and 2, released a few months back, contained episodes that traced the origins of several characters and their assemblage into the powerful, but (in the Marvel tradition) angst-filled, dysfunctional crime fighting Avengers family.

Since the two new DVDs  -- Volume 3: Iron Man Unleased and Volume 4: Thor's Last Stand -- offer 13 additional episodes, all interconnected in some way by story arcs and character relationships, it's tricky business for the uninitiated to start with them ""cold,"" though each set includes one fact-filled ""Avengers Unmasked"" version of a key episode as a bonus feature.

This information comes in mighty handy, even as a refresher. Part of the fun of the Marvel Avengers is keeping track of who's got a beef with whom, which couples are an ""item,"" and which villains are either bent on controlling the galaxy or just tortured souls who are lashing out.

Therein lies the Marvel charm: the good guys are not perfect, they bicker and even hurt each other, yet united they are the only hope against the total destruction of the entire universe, which is threatened roughly every four episodes.

I know that's a little snide. Actually, the stories are laced with humor, characters are always given opportunities for development between battles, and the animation is staged with the epic scope of a blockbuster Hollywood action movie. This is quality stuff.

But if you don't know the Wasp from the Enchantress, you'll enjoy following the proceedings in Vols. 2 and 3 by either watching 1 and 2 first or catching up with the ""Unmasked"" features.",1320537600,,1877,5.016077170418006
