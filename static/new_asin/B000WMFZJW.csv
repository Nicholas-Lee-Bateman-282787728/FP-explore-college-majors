2985818,5,B000WMFZJW,This film is full of over-the-top hilarity!  Really funny and crazy script with great performances.,1238025600,2,99,5.6
2985819,3,B000WMFZJW,"Maybe it helped that I had been drinking when I watched this, but it had some funny bits.

I liked the sketch about 'taking sex to the next level'. Thought the idea of the sex toy being jealous of the new girlfriend was funny. Ok, not all the sketches were hilarious, but they were for the most part entertaining. I've seen worse comedies.

2985820,1,B000WMFZJW,"Im not joking. I saw this movie last night and was in awe of how ridiculous this movie is.  It has not plot no story and makes no sense what so ever.  It's not even like those ""happy accident"" movies where there so bad there good. This movie is just insanely bad.  Not one laugh for me.  If you really hate some one and want to wish them pain. Get them this movie or rent it for them.  But only if you truly hate some that person.",1236124800,5,430,3.896551724137931
2985821,3,B000WMFZJW,"A DVD that customers ask about for two reasons - 1. It has the the Dimension Extreme cover art - and 2. it appears to be blanketed under the last 15 parody films that sucked.

Regarding 1: Not sure how this crossed paths with the other 29 films released under the DE tag since 2006 - but this one gets the sole cover of being the only non-horror piece. And 2: this crew made Not Another Teen Movie, which actually had some funny parts. The film premise is a mix of ""ads"" and skit like bits covering the exploration of high school teens seeking sex.

Warning: Adult spoilers ahead: Let us be clear - this film is disgusting (and sometimes funny) in so many ways, but then again so is the teen sexual awareness experiences it tries to represent. You will see a mix of skits including Abe Lincoln having anal sex, a Blue Balls Puppet helping a teen boy get off, some gross fart humor, bondage scenes with little people, sheep and leather, porn filming mixed with teen musicals, a sex ed class teacher that hands out 30 sex toys and partners up kids to explore sex with each other, and - well - you might get the point.

Recognizable faces came (no pun meant) on to add their own personal fun to the mix but do not expect Muniz or any other other casts to bare it all for their art; The only nudity comes from several actresses having a good time on screen and with each other. The highlight has to be Matt Lillard's mockumentary style excerpts helping young men to have sex with girls. Good luck...",1234742400,11,1495,4.332142857142857

When a comedy isn't funny it has no reason to exist.  And I am one who has found even many Adam Sandler movies that others cannot stand funny.  Waste your time on this at your own peril.

I turned it on the second time because I forgot I started watching it the first time. If you have watched every single movie possible and you're paralyzed, everyone is gone, and the Extreme Movie comes on, only then should you watch. Or, better alternative,  just hold your breath until you pass out. I'm not sure drugs will improve this movie and if you like this movie, you probably liked Meet the Spartans, which, honestly, was quite possibly the worst movie ever made. I would rather watch an instructional video on sitting in a chair than either of those movies. Enjoy!",1461715200,,736,4.533834586466165

There were quite a number of actors in it that we recognized and did find it fairly enjoyable.  Don't expect a movie, it is more like a bunch of sketches with a faint trace of a movie in it.  Just take it for what it is and I think you will find it funny (FYI, it is very crude humor).",1459209600,,434,4.011627906976744

The scenes felt too disjointed, too jarring by jumping from one seemingly unrelated scene to another. However, many of the scenes did wind up tying together with a few orphans. The acting was decent, not necessarily stellar, but at least I know I saw professionals on the screen. The directing and cinematography were also professional, though not amazing or spectacular.

2986463,2,B000WMFZJW,"While I was watching ""Extreme Movie"", I was like a lot of others who thought this movie was just plain bad. It really is bad. It seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be, or where its focus should be. The film was everywhere. I originally rented it thinking it was a spoof of teen raunchy comedies like ""American Pie."" The thing you really have to know about this movie it is more like one giant sketch, with several small sketches that make up the whole. Occasionally they would intersect and connect with each other. It is not a traditional movie, or spoof. I would deem it a sketch movie.

Even understanding that maybe a sketch movie, it still fails in the overall outcome it tries to achieve. The film has a great concept, if it was delivered right. Marketing happened to also kill this movie. If it was advertised differently audience expectations wouldn't have been so extremely disappointed.

Still, many of the sketches are just not entertaining. The opening sketch ""To the next level"" another great concept in theory, but it just fails flat on tape.  Most of the shorts in the film are embarrassing to watch for the actors involved. Some like the unfunny ""fart sketch"" just drag on and on when it didn't need too. There are a few gems in the ""Extreme Movie"" like the short ""STD E-cards."" The concept is funny. The delivery was decent but could have been taken to the next level.

Another okay sketch was ""Blue Balls"" it wasn't that funny but at least it was entertaining. The best part in the entire movie, at least for me, was the ""Who ordered a rape"" sketch.  After talking to a girl (who happens to enjoy role playing that involves rape) in an online chat room, a teenage boy gets asked to come over to her place for a night of sex. He was required to come over in a mask to role play a rape fantasy, and not to drop character. The teenager goes to the wrong apartment building and plays the rapist to an older woman. He doesn't realize that she not the same person who he was talking to online. This was the best part of the film, it made to movie worth it. (No rape involved) The scene was hilarious, the dialogue was great. Too bad the rest of the film wasn't like this scene.

The film ends in a song. The ""porn"" song wasn't the greatest but still had its moments. If you are going to rent or buy this movie, you might just want to go scene selections instead and pick and choose the bits that are watched. Or be prepared to view a sketch movie that isn't that funny overall.

3220318,3,B000WMFZJW,"A DVD that customers ask about for two reasons - 1. It has the the Dimension Extreme cover art - and 2. it appears to be blanketed under the last 15 parody films that sucked.

Regarding 1: Not sure how this crossed paths with the other 29 films released under the DE tag since 2006 - but this one gets the sole cover of being the only non-horror piece. And 2: this crew made Not Another Teen Movie, which actually had some funny parts. The film premise is a mix of ""ads"" and skit like bits covering the exploration of high school teens seeking sex.

Warning: Adult spoilers ahead: Let us be clear - this film is disgusting (and sometimes funny) in so many ways, but then again so is the teen sexual awareness experiences it tries to represent. You will see a mix of skits including Abe Lincoln having anal sex, a Blue Balls Puppet helping a teen boy get off, some gross fart humor, bondage scenes with little people, sheep and leather, porn filming mixed with teen musicals, a sex ed class teacher that hands out 30 sex toys and partners up kids to explore sex with each other, and - well - you might get the point.

Recognizable faces came (no pun meant) on to add their own personal fun to the mix but do not expect Muniz or any other other casts to bare it all for their art; The only nudity comes from several actresses having a good time on screen and with each other. The highlight has to be Matt Lillard's mockumentary style excerpts helping young men to have sex with girls. Good luck...",1234742400,11,1495,4.332142857142857

If you have watched every single movie possible and you're paralyzed, everyone is gone, and the Extreme Movie comes on, only then should you watch. Or, better alternative,  just hold your breath until you pass out. I'm not sure drugs will improve this movie and if you like this movie, you probably liked Meet the Spartans, which, honestly, was quite possibly the worst movie ever made.

The film was not bad, but it also was not a stand-out production. The writing could have been better, some of the jokes simply did not deliver although more often than not they were funny enough. The scenes felt too disjointed, too jarring by jumping from one seemingly unrelated scene to another. However, many of the scenes did wind up tying together with a few orphans. The acting was decent, not necessarily stellar, but at least I know I saw professionals on the screen. The directing and cinematography were also professional, though not amazing or spectacular.

I only watched it because I'm running out of Michael Cera movies to watch, but he doesn't show up till the 48 minute mark and once his short is over he doesn't come back.

3220960,2,B000WMFZJW,"While I was watching ""Extreme Movie"", I was like a lot of others who thought this movie was just plain bad. It really is bad. It seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be, or where its focus should be. The film was everywhere. I originally rented it thinking it was a spoof of teen raunchy comedies like ""American Pie."" The thing you really have to know about this movie it is more like one giant sketch, with several small sketches that make up the whole. Occasionally they would intersect and connect with each other. It is not a traditional movie, or spoof. I would deem it a sketch movie.

Even understanding that maybe a sketch movie, it still fails in the overall outcome it tries to achieve. The film has a great concept, if it was delivered right. Marketing happened to also kill this movie. If it was advertised differently audience expectations wouldn't have been so extremely disappointed.

Still, many of the sketches are just not entertaining. The opening sketch ""To the next level"" another great concept in theory, but it just fails flat on tape.  Most of the shorts in the film are embarrassing to watch for the actors involved. Some like the unfunny ""fart sketch"" just drag on and on when it didn't need too. There are a few gems in the ""Extreme Movie"" like the short ""STD E-cards."" The concept is funny. The delivery was decent but could have been taken to the next level.

Another okay sketch was ""Blue Balls"" it wasn't that funny but at least it was entertaining. The best part in the entire movie, at least for me, was the ""Who ordered a rape"" sketch.  After talking to a girl (who happens to enjoy role playing that involves rape) in an online chat room, a teenage boy gets asked to come over to her place for a night of sex. He was required to come over in a mask to role play a rape fantasy, and not to drop character. The teenager goes to the wrong apartment building and plays the rapist to an older woman. He doesn't realize that she not the same person who he was talking to online. This was the best part of the film, it made to movie worth it. (No rape involved) The scene was hilarious, the dialogue was great. Too bad the rest of the film wasn't like this scene.

The film ends in a song. The ""porn"" song wasn't the greatest but still had its moments. If you are going to rent or buy this movie, you might just want to go scene selections instead and pick and choose the bits that are watched. Or be prepared to view a sketch movie that isn't that funny overall.
