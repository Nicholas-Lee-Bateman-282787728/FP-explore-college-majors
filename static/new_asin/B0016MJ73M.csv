3159231,4,B0016MJ73M,"I wish Sony would have upgraded a few of the video sources on episodes instead of merely repackaging the original season sets. While there are folks complaining about the spindle packaging, it's perfect for me. If you have limited shelf space, you've figured out ways to dump the boxes. I keep my DVDs in a card catalog storage unit. All my discs go in envelopes.",1213747200,3,363,4.6

Obviously, Sony doesn't care (as of yet) and wants my DVD collection to get as scratched as possible (so I eventually replace it).

Buy the individual seasons. I'm sorry I sold mine...",1213747200,132,703,5.444444444444445
3159233,1,B0016MJ73M,"SOAP is truly one of the best comedies of all time! Great actors (well acted as well), Great comedic timing, and great plot twists. So before I go any further, the show itself is a 5++ star rating.  This review is not about the show, but how the DVD set that is NOT COMPLETE and how the Studio who produce this (Sony/Columbia Tristar) have shown an injustice to a great T.V. Show.
As mentioned by a reviewer before me....the packaging is the worst of it's kind.  I already have the seasons sets (which the packaging is 100 times better), but I wanted to check the new complete series (online reviews and at Best Buy) to see if there is anything new/extra and or different than the season sets. The packaging is VERY FLIMSY. And it is as described by the prior reviewer in a spiral format (like you buy blank DVD's or CDs). Even tvshowsondvd.com gave it the worst packaging ever (see the following link for details on how bad the packaging is: [...] )
In addition to the bad packaging, both, the complete series and the individual season sets, the episodes have been cut. Each episode should run approximately 25 minutes.....some episodes have been cut down to 22-23 minutes. Why is this? Frankly, I don't know why?  The reason I do know they have been cut is I originally bought the VHS tapes from Columbia House years ago, and they were in the original ABC broadcast form. In particular to the first season, there used to be a ""parental discretion"" by the announcer in the beginning of the show.  Also, there is a scene in the first season with Jody (Billy Crystal) who is trying on Mary's clothes. That scene has been cut short.  The only thing I can think of why it was cut, is Jody is singing something while looking in the mirror (possible music rights? How petty can this be?).  But these episodes, in both the complete series and the individual season sets are NOT COMPLETE!!! For casual buyer of t.v. series, this may not bother you. But if you are a die hard fan of the show, like me, you may be very disappointed.  I suggest if you want the UNCUT VERSION of the series, look for the Columbia House Videos (there were a total of 23 videos) on Ebay and transfer them on DVD yourself.
Another problem, and the most annoying of all, is there are three 90 minute summer specials that are missing.  These specials were between season shows that featured Jessica (Katherine Helmond) and another character conversing about the season before (a clip show). ABC use to air these in the summer before the new season started to get the audience up to date. Because these specials were not included in the individual season sets, I thought, this Complete Series set would have them. NOT A CHANCE. They are the same exact discs as the individual season sets. Nothing is changed but the packaging. And even the season sets have only two extras (2nd Season Set Only). A very lame interview with the writers of the show and the pilot episode reprise (Hello, the pilot episode was on the First season set....why do we need it again on the 2nd season set???) In any case, the 90 minute specials would have been great addition for extras to this wonderful show. Only 2 of the 90 minute sp ecials can be found on VHS. The 1st 90 minute special (the summer special between the 1st and 2nd season), was released on VHS only and it's called ""The Best Of Soap: Who Killed Peter?"". This is where Burt visits Jessica in her jail cell after being found guilty of Peter's murder and they go over each character (thru clips) of who could have killed Burt's son, Peter. Another 90 minute special can be found on VHS only as well, (the summer special between the 3rd and 4th season). The VHS was released with the title name: ""The Best Of Soap: Jessica's Wonderful Life"".  This is where Jessica, after being in a coma, goes to heaven and visits an Angel (played by ""Golden Girl"" Bea Arthur). Jessica explains to the angel (once again thru clips) why she can't die and her family needs her.  The only 90 minute special that is not on VHS or DVD is the summer show between the 2nd and 3rd season.  This is where Jessica says goodbye to Benson (the butler, played by Robert Guillaume) who leaves the show to star in own series ""Benson"".  Jessica, once again, thru clips, converses with Benson about the events of the season before, and why he needs to stay.  Ironically enough, Mr. Guillaume went to star in his own show after this, however, he did come back in the first 3-4 episodes of the 3rd season. His return to Soap was to resolve a situation which involved saving the Tate's son Billy from a cult group called the Sunnies (Side note: this is a classic scene which featured Benson, Chester, the Major and Detective Donahue as the step brothers...hilarious!)  There is a scene in the beginning of the third season when Benson returns and Jessica shouts out ""Benson, your back!"". This may have confused some people who watch the DVD's wondering ""Back from where?"".  Later, Benson says goodbye for the second time during the 3rd season. These specials should have been on this release, but once again, the studios have disappointed the fans of this great sh ow!!
All and All, the show is still terrific (A Golden Classic) and it deserves 5 stars in itself. But there is two many wrongs with releasing the DVD's under false pretenses by the Studio. The episodes are not complete, the packaging (for the Complete Series only) stinks, and they are missing out on 3 of the 90 minute specials that would COMPLETE the entire run of the series. For the release of this DVD and the Studio who released it, only 1 star!  As for the buyers out there, if your only a casual fan of the series, it's fine, but buy the individual season sets. the packaging is so much better. Do not buy this one...you will eventually have to repackage the DVD's yourself because they will easily get scratched.  If you are a completest die hard fan of the show, either buy the complete unedited episodes on VHS tapes from Ebay or some other website and transfer them on DVD yourself OR wait for the Studio to wise up and get the REAL COMPLETE SET (Unedited episodes and the 90 minute specials) when they offer the series in another release. I will get off my SOAP box now!! I hope this helps the buyers out there. Thanks for reading.",1213142400,703,6282,4.515845070422535
3159234,2,B0016MJ73M,"This is a great price for one of the best comedic shows of the seventies.  It includes all four seasons and ends with the unresolved cliffhanger at the end of season four.  For this alone I would give the set four or five stars but the packaging is so infantile and atrocious that I actually recommend NOT buying this set and waiting for the individual seasons to drop in price or go on sale.  The packaging is a cardboard slipcase that contains what basically amounts to a molded plastic spindle (like you would buy a pack of 50 blanks) that fits in the cardboard box.  The discs are all stacked on top of each other!  There's no episode guide.  Nothing.  This is as about as far as you can take ""No Frills"" without just putting the discs in paper sleeves.  I'm actually going to purchase blank DVD cases and scan the cover to make my own cases.  Get the series for this great price but only if you dare.",1213142400,145,905,4.3076923076923075

3159257,5,B0016MJ73M,"This review is for Soap, the complete series.

Considering how the show was filmed in the 70s, the picture quality is exactly as I would expect it to be. To those complaining about it, what do you expect for a 1970s tv show?

I grew up as a child watching this show, and even as a small child I found it very funny and entertaining. This definitely is by no means a childs show, especially by todays standards of political correctness. I however understand that this show is all about humor, so make sure you understand the context of where it was coming from back in the day. You definitely won't find a show like this on TV now.

One word of warning, the product was shipped in an envelope and not a box causing it to get crushed and the dvd case damaged. I am awaiting a replacement which I hope won't be sent the same way.",1518652800,,826,4.215189873417722
3159258,3,B0016MJ73M,"The quality is good, easy to navigate the menus, etc. the only problem so far is the number of repeated episodes.

3159262,1,B0016MJ73M,"What a great disappointment! First, let's start off with the packaging. All 8 disks had been packed on thin cardboard sleeves, (two disks per piece of cardboard), then put into this 'outer box', sticking out an inch at the bottom. That 'outer box' looks as if it was used for many different things besides 8 DVD disks. Most likely other television series that had various different numbers of disks in it. Since these 8 DVD disks only filled about half of that outer box, there was a spacer piece of cardboard, (piece double folded), put in there to try and take up the extra space. That's it...

Naturally, that extra piece if cardboard did little to  offer a suitable package for this set. Packaged in a padded envelope and sent through the postal service, it arrived 'crushed'!

The day this set arrived, (seeing this cheap, now crushed, unsuitable packaging), I went to the eBay site and ordered a special, hard plastic case, that holds 8 DVDs for this set. It cost me about $5.

Next, there are absolutely no features included with this collection. No special features, no subtitle options, no 'nothing'!

Still, I loved being taken way back to when these were in television. I was a huge fan, and enjoyed the series immensely. These days, it was a very  refreshing release for the day's stresses. Even though I had watched this in the past, I had seen no reruns since then, so it was almost like watching it for the very first time, all over again. Every new scene was like a surprise to me.

Naturally, as with all television programs, there was season finales, often with someone getting shot, or some other, 'cliff hanger', where you had to wait for the new season to see what happened. A nice advantage having all the seasons right there in front of you! No more waiting months for the next season.

Well, so I'm lost up in this episode, where not one if the stars happens to be in front of someone holding a gun, but 'three' of them!

I'm trying to think back, but my memory had failed me. I went to reach for the next disk, and there was none! That was the end of the 4th season. I looked at the packaging and it stated all 90 episodes were included, and that was the 90th episode.

What a disappointment! To leave such situations completely unanswered? Thats not right! These days when someone leaves a series, they leave in an episode, or they are at least killed off. Not back then... Don't know why this series wasn't continued with the popularity of it. Possibly there was just too much censorship back then. What a shame!",1517184000,2,2539,4.536105032822757
3159263,5,B0016MJ73M,"I could say a lot about this farcical ""soap opera"", but I think it has been very well covered on Wikipedia.  Just look up ""Soap TV Series"" and you'll learn all about it.  It was more than hysterical.  I looked forward to watching it every week.  Plot twists galore and every one filled with gut busting laughs.  Now I am a happy camper because I have all the shows and I'm having so much fun rewatching it all.  If you like to laugh, and who doesn't, I highly recommend this set of DVDs.  I don't have to tell you that we all can use a good laugh these days.",1516838400,2,558,4.064220183486238

3159355,1,B0016MJ73M,This is NOT the complete series! I saw this show on TV & ordered this for my family. & come to find out it's missing a season & a half! What the bleep is up with that?!,1492473600,4,168,3.5675675675675675
3159356,5,B0016MJ73M,"I ordered SOAP seasons 1-4 for my mother for Christmas.  It was cheaper to get each season separately than to get the boxed set.  The DVDs haven't been viewed all the way through yet.  Although SOAP is before my time, we're both big fans of of the show.  According to other reviews, there's a lot that's been edited out.  As I said, neither of us has watched the DVDs all the way through yet so I can't say that I agree with that or not.  But, even if that's the case, I'm still so thrilled that SOAP is available on DVD at all.  You can't help but laugh out loud when watchihg this show, no matter how many times you've seen an episode.  It's hillarious even decades after having aired!  Seems to me the show was ahead of its time too- having fun with issues that were taboo at the time, making it still relevant today.  No show compares to SOAP!",1492473600,,847,4.204968944099379
3159357,5,B0016MJ73M,"I had forgotten how funny this series is.  I bought it on a whim and ended up binge watching because I had to see what happened next.  I love the way they fit so many stories into this series while still keeping it in a 'soap opera' format.  The best part is that each storyline was wrapped up in 3-4 episodes so it didn't drag on forever.  If you've seen Soap in the past, or are seeing it for the first time, you will be delighted with this series.",1492214400,2,450,4.022471910112359

3159373,5,B0016MJ73M,"This show was awesome when it came out and still can stand the test of time. Even though the show was taped decades ago, it's still is currently topical which I guess shows we as a nation have not grown much in certain ares of acceptance. I really expected it to feel old and out of date, but it was far from that!! There were some episodes that seem to be missing scenes in the first disc or two, but the others seem to be showing entire episodes. The only way you know you missed something is at the end of the show they go over what had happened and somethings they show were not shown in the episode. That was a bit disappointing, but the rest made up for the few!! If you loved it then, you will love it now. If youve never seen it, buy it, you will love it!!",1489881600,2,764,4.0

3159391,2,B0016MJ73M,"The new 8-disc edition of SOAP suffers from too much compression and muddiness.  The picture is not nearly as good or sharp as Sony's 12-disc original set, which can still be found easily.  The masters appear to be the same as those used for the Sony sets, so there are short episodes, but as this is not likely to ever be remastered and reissued properly, the Sony discs are the ones to get.  Price is good, but the compromise is a bit too much for a show you will want to watch again and again.",1484438400,2,496,4.2
3159392,2,B0016MJ73M,"While our entire family adores this show, we ended up sending these back because the product was not properly represented on the product page.
We had specifically selected a more expensive version of the series because it listed closed captions as a feature, which a hearing impaired member of our family needs.
Regrettably, these DVDS do NOT include closed captions.
In fact, they don't have any special features of any kind.
They are simply the bare bones episodes themselves, which have obviously not been enhanced in anyway.
Adding insult to injury, when we informed the vendor that we were returning the product because of an error on the product page, they made it clear they really didn't care.
While they may not have control over the contents of a DVD, they do have control over the product page and should have at least said they were sorry for having inconvenienced us.",1484352000,24,880,4.8344370860927155

3159738,1,B0016MJ73M,"ABYSMAL ""New & Improved"" stiff cardboard sleeve packaging in a flimsy outer box as of December 2015. Half the discs are badly scratched. Not even worth seeking a replacement because half of the discs in that one will be scratched. Everybody and their brother knows that putting discs in cardboard sleeves is the absolute worst packaging possible. Your discs arrive scratched and will be scratched further every time you remove or replace the discs in them.

How is Mill Creek not aware of this? Guess they enjoy getting loads of product returned for refund, like mine will be. I don't pay new prices for scratched-up, used-looking junk. People complain about getting multi-disc sets on a spindle, but that's a DREAM compared to this. Those crummy paper sleeves with the cellophane window are better than this. Giving them a good slap shot across the carpet is better than this. Terrible job here, I will never buy any set from Mill Creek packaged like this because it is completely pointless, unless you're the type who uses DVDs for coasters anyway and won't mind the damage.",1449014400,8,1076,4.879781420765028

3159903,4,B0016MJ73M,"This is a series about two families, two sisters, Jessica Tate-the Tates (the rich) and Mary Campbell-the Campbells (the middle). I have just started Season 2 and this series is about a crazy mix of family characters and their dysfunctions with their butler Benson, who is continually sarcastic. There situations change from one episode to another but the basic problems remain. The writing made light of some of the more serious issues coming forth when this series was produced as well as general human weakness(s). I was in my teens when I first saw some of the episodes and laughed at many of the predicaments, situations, of these two seeming opposing families.
Season 1
The Tates (rich), the head of the family, Chester, is embezzling funds, cheating on his wife with whomever will let him, and is a murderer of the offending lover (tennis pro, Peter) of his wife, Jessica, and almost allows his wife to go to prison for the crime, until he confesses up. The grandfather (Jessica's father, the Major)) is out of his mind, living in the memory of his participation in WWII as an eternal soldier and always wears his uniform, hat and sword, ready in every situation with a military response, even crawling on the ground. Benson the Butler and cook, knows what a loony toon family he works for, does not like Chester and ignores him and the two daughters and the young son,  He doesn't like answering the door and sometimes decides not to cook, though Jessica he loves.
Jessica, seems innocent enough (she expresses herself as such) but understands more than she is given credit for, being a ""housewife"", ignorant of the ways of the world. Her affair with the tennis pro, Peter, her stepson, was due to her loneliness, as her husband Chester, is always ""working"" and never home, having an affair with his secretary. Her affair is brief, as she has a conscience of grief, of adultery, as she finds out that her neighbor and her daughter are also having the same lessons! With this, she ends it, and shortly thereafter he is killed in the shower and Corinne is the first to be arrested and goes to Jail.
Meanwhile, in a restaurant with her sister, she catches her husband with his secretary, who blackmails him. A lesson truly lived and learned. She now believes he does not love her and wants to separate. The daughter, Corinne, finds out what's really going on with her tennis ""pro"" and leaves him as well. But then her real mother, Ingrid appears. Now she just wants to be loved, and so goes after and entices a priest to leave the priesthood, gets permission, so he does and he asks her to marry him, and she says yes. Corinne's cousin, Eunice, is a journalist, and travels around, and likes to sleep around, with powerful men, and chooses Senators as her story. After Corinne's name is cleared, Jessica Tate is arrested for the murder. Chester tries to commit suicide and then remembers he killed the tennis pro, Peter.
Meanwhile, at the Campbells, the wife, Mary Campbell, learns that her son, Jodie, is gay (his lover is a pro quarterback), her son Danny thinks he's a real comedian as does Burt and Mary is just confused. Danny is in the mob and has been told he must kill his stepfather (news to him) for killing his father or else he'll be killed, so he dresses in disguise, as he can't go through with the killing and hides himself. Then Burt's long lost son, Chuck, comes to visit from Hollywood, with his schizophrenic ventriloquist doll, Bob, that he thinks is real. Burt is the killer of Mary's first husband, pushing him off a high construction ledge and goes into the hospital to cure his impotence and his ""invisible"" delusion, thinking that when he snaps his fingers he becomes invisible. He is cured of one, but not the other. Meanwhile, Jodie goes in for a sex change operation for his lover, but he tells Jodie's not get it because he is getting married so Jodie attempts suicide but fails and does not have the operation. Later, he gets involved with a female friend, separates from her, then goes away on a wknd trip, then moves in with her.

I have just started Season 2
The Tates
Jessica Tate is released.  Her lawyer told her he loves her and now that Chester is in jail, goes after her. Her husband says he loves her, before he confesses to the crime. Everyone was devastated with Jessica's verdict but not so much with Chester's, as they had blamed everyone in each family. Benson is glad Chester is gone and promises Jessica he will help the young son. Corinne comes home and chooses Jessica over her real mother. Ingrid, who helped to convict Jessica. Chester is forced to escape from jail by his cell mate, Dutch. Dutch forces the whole family into the basement to set rules.
The Campbells
Danny meets a mob princess, Elaine, and talks him into marrying her or her father will kill him. Carol tells Jodie she's pregnant. Father Tim's mother puts a curse on Corinne and Tim.  More to come.....",1441152000,,4925,4.63802978235968

3159951,2,B0016MJ73M,"I don't understand how a re-release of SOAP on DVD gets screwed up again. First, as others mentioned the discs were put in paper cases, something you would find for a game that would come with a computer from 1995. Now I was still willing to give this 4 or even 5 stars if this were a complete series but it's not.

Yes, they did add the intros and outros to every episode which is an improvement over the last complete series release. One episode is still the syndicated version but ok. However, the show is still missing entire scenes. The second half of the 4th season had hour long episodes. These episodes on the DVD are the syndicated versions (cut down to 30 minutes). I would have more than OK with that but the syndicated episodes cut out full scenes.

Most fans do not realize there are deleted scenes missing on the DVD because they grew up on SOAP in reruns or just don't remember. If you had the VHS sets from Columbia House you would have seen these deleted scenes. What's even more puzzling is that that there are three full hour episodes on the DVD set. These episodes were also split into 30 minute episodes for syndication. The set itself is very inconsistent.

SOAP is one my favorite shows and I would love to one day own the entire series on DVD with the 4th season having hour long episodes in their original form. Then again if you never knew these scenes were missing then you probably are willing to give the show 4 or 5 stars which for your purposes is cool.",1439510400,25,1484,4.369565217391305

Soap was filmed in front of live audiences so, the laughter is not ""canned"" and more contagious and spontaneous . It's still funny, but you have to crank back your mindset to a time before the ""political correctness"" that has numbed our senses and colored our lenses we see with today. The ""F"" word is not used, nor the ""B"" word for women, just good old humor.",1434844800,,520,4.316326530612245

3160071,3,B0016MJ73M,"When they announced the re-release of the complete series I was hoping for something a bit better. I've passed on buying the Complete set before because the reviews for the packaging was so bad. Should have kept waiting.

Rather than the spindle style case people complained about previously now it is just a big clunky box (snap open style like most DVD cases, twice as thick as the standard 6-disc cases) and inside *facepalm*... Inside of the front cover is just two parallel bumpers that fit to the outside of the inner  holder for the discs... The right panel that holds the discs is basically a four sided box that holds the discs, in their own individual... paper sleeves, yes, the dreaded paper sleeves. At the bottom of the box, on the inside edge, there are two tabs that you push down away from the sleeves to release the discs. Two of them had dislodged from the inner box and were loose in the case. Thankfully it doesn't appear to have caused any damage to the discs.

I'll have buy a 8-disc multi disc case to transfer the DVDs into, unfortunately due to the way they made the case cover, I'll have to redesign one to put in the new case, as the spine in this one will be far to wide for a slimmer case.

Bad design choice by the DVD production company, bad, bad design.

PS.... NO EPISODE BOOKLET / GUIDE :( :( :( :( There are 8 discs, 90 episodes and plenty of extra room in the case, is it too hard to print a quick little 2 page episode guide, so those of us that don't have the episode list memorized can know what is on each disc... the only thing they've go is on the discs that say Show #_ - Show #_, not helpful.",1433203200,16,1636,4.264516129032258

Billy Crystal as a gay single father trying to gain primary custody of his biological daughter,
Bert with his mental illness and belief he can be invisible,
Danny and Polly as an interracial couple (or as Danny stated, an ""intersexual couple.""

Like the TV show ""All in the Family"", some of the ""jokes"" are bigoted, i.e., ""Is Eunice an Indian giver?""
The clothes are seriously dated, but not all laughs are. We have enjoyed every episode better this second time around.

Note: To really appreciate how cutting edge this series was, start from the beginning. If you try to pick up on it half way through, it might appear just plain stupid. Not to say some of it isn't, but you recognize the wittiness of it when you get sucked in from ground one. ""Confused?

3160167,5,B0016MJ73M,"For those of us who remember the 70s Soap was a very controversial spoof of soap operas that in most markets aired late at night.  Younger viewers will laugh since it seems so tame now.

But many future stars cut their teeth on this show, and the over the top performances are a farceurs delight.  In one series, we have television's first openly gay character, humorous but heartfelt reactions to adultery, murder, alien abduction and demonic possession.  All done with a playful wink.  The series is well worth your time, and it is very easy to become addicted.

Now for the downside.  The DVD includes no special features, and episodes appear to be the cut broadcast episodes.  Prior to each season there was a 90 minute special featuring the characters and clips from the prior season.  Although the specials did not contain plotlines germane to the season they were quite creative and had some special moments.  The DVD package does not include them.

Spoiler warning-the series was intended to last 5 seasons but was unceremoniously cancelled after 4 leaving many storylines unresolved.  In the years since this time, the actors and writers have offered many suggestions as to what might have happened, but none was included.

Still the price is good and the slim packaging, though inconvenient is space efficient.  Since there is no real good DVD release of the series I would recommend this for no other reason than to see (not perfectly) a classic series.",1388534400,6,1464,4.874493927125506

3160169,5,B0016MJ73M,"Way before ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" made their viewers wait all summer to find out what happened to their favorite characters ""Soap"" started the ""prime time cliffhanger"" to much success. Before a single episode was aired there was much controversy about ""Soap"" as religious groups pleaded with ABC not to carry the program as they felt the series was depicting people with no morals in terms of sex, life and love. ""Soap"" was really (before ""Dynasty"") the first network series to explore homosexuality in an open manner, albeit not to the greatest of its ability. Still, the show became a huge hit for the network in a comfortable Tuesday night time slot airing after the then popular ""Three's Company"". The show also made Billy Crystal a household name.

 This set is exceptional with every episode of the series in their entirety, uncut and without commercials. The shows look surprisingly good although it was shot on cheap videotape as compared to film.

 The outright star was Katherine Helmond who played Jessica, a combination of Rose Nyland and Edith Bunker, someone the viewers loved. The series won Emmys for Catherine Damon and Richard Mulligan.

 Early guest-stars who popped up on ""Soap"" were Ted Shakelford, hunky Robert Urich and Dinah Manoff.",1388275200,2,1256,5.043478260869565

Hilarity to the extreme but touches lots of subjects that may have not been a comedy ie homosexuality.  This is very tastefully done and is done seriously good for a comedy.  The writers take on some deadly subjects ie rascism, sexual promiscuity, affairs, all subjects are tastefully done and pull on the heart strings.  The more serious the subject the more deftly handled with some atrosiusly good wit.  The comedy does not laugh at people but always with them.

I did read other reviews about packaging and missing content, but since she wasn't around for the first run of the show, she doesn't know what she is missing.

3160248,5,B0016MJ73M,"I never watched this show much when it was on the air, but someone I used to date was really into it.  Now I've been catching up with all the episodes on Netfix, and can honestly say that this show was downright funny with all its twists and turns.  You start watching it, and you get hooked.  With a fabulous twist on daytime dramas that haven't changed all that much--except the plots move 10 times faster--this show is a must for anyone who likes their comedy both sympathetic to likable, outlandish characters and surprisingly fresh and witty.  Even after all these years, the topics of adultery, crime, and sexual controversy are still universal, and there isn't a storyline on here that won't appeal to somebody who picks up on the show's approach.

Cudos to the late Richard Mulligan, Katherine Helmond, and Robert Guilluame for playing their roles so very well, not to mention Billy Crystal, ventriloquist Jay Johnson,  and Ted Waas.  This show is so much fun to get sucked into, and it amazes me how creator and writer Susan Harris could keep coming up with something new and crazy for 90 episodes, because I don't think I could do it past three.  Talk about creativity!  When you consider this show the springboard that launched other hit shows such as Benson, Empty Nest, Who's the Boss, and Golden Girls, you will also recognize that a lot of the people behind the scenes of this show were also responsible for the ones that followed.

3160262,5,B0016MJ73M,"I loved Soap when it came out in the late 70's and I still love it. The writers and producers took a major risk when they decided to do this series. They knew that Billy Crystal was taking a major risk with his career playing a gay son. This was unheard of. Though I can't remember his real name, the role of Bensen was excellent. He received so much slack for being a butler. But not only did he do it well, he pulled it off with so much decorum and class. He was the only sane member of complete ensemble. That's why he received his own series after two years of being on Soap. I would buy the series, but there is only one season and I know there were at least two or three seasons.

3160266,4,B0016MJ73M,"The show itself is 5 stars, and definitely in line with some of the best comedies ever made.

Regarding the packaging - an issue that seems to appear on many of the negative reviews - I personally find it adequate, even if there are better arrangements on the market.

I wouldn't call it, as others suggested, ""the worst packaging ever"". That title should be kept for the ""M*A*S*H the Martinis and Medicine Collection"". which is by far the worst packaging I've seen so far (also, alas, for a 5 star show...)

The upside of the package is that it does protect the discs well during shipping, and the downside is that it's less convenient if you use them a lot.

The one star deduction is due to it's total lack of extras and subtitles.

I'm a non-English speaker, and as such I found (along with my children) certain parts hard to understand especially Bob's lines...

I hope some day a more complete and sleek edition will be produced for all of the show's fans out there.",1323475200,,972,4.494318181818182

They are hilarious!  Well worth the money.,1323388800,3,382,4.4
3160268,5,B0016MJ73M,"I must say I was a little apprehensive about ordering Soap: The Complete Series (Slim Packaging) 12-Disc set after reading all of the negative reviews.
However, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it in the mail.
The 12 discs were stacked on top of one another (as stated in other reviews) inside a disc shaped recessed plastic holder. Then a piece of disc shaped corrugated cardboard was pressed firmly into place on top of the 12 discs to prevent them from moving around in transit.
And the entire recessed plastic holder w/discs was wrapped inside shrinkwrap. This was slid inside the cardboard outer cover which was also wrapped in shrinkwrap.  I found the packaging to be very adequate.

I inspected the surface of each of the 12 discs and found no defects or surface scratches.  As of this review I've viewed only Disc #1 from the First Season of Soap, and I find the picture and sound quality to be very acceptable, taking into account these are transfers from video tape and long before HDTV came along. I feel $30 for all four seasons of Soap is a steal.  If I ever lost my 12-Disc Set of Soap: The Complete Series (Slim Packaging)...

Richard Mulligan and Dinah Manoff (Empty Nest), Katherine Helmond and Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), Robert Guillaume and Inga Swenson (Benson).

The cast is great and the acting is top notch. The last time I watched was when it first aired and the occasional rerun. I hate watching reruns unless I watch from episode one so I waited patiently for it to become available on DVD. I guess I can't claim to be an expert on the show and I didn't buy the individual seasons since I was waiting for the prices to drop. When I saw this all in one, I thought it was a good opportunity to get the whole set. I agree with other reviewers that this is very cheap packaging. I don't like the menus and the picture quality is not befitting such a great show, it definitely deserves better treatment. One of the discs also had a circular defect on the printed side.

3160334,4,B0016MJ73M,"As a child of the 80s, I grew up watching reruns of Soap on television.  Though I didn't get a lot of the jokes, I thought that Benson and Jessica were by far the funniest, and I became a fan of the series.  Now that I'm older, I can watch the show for its social commentary and hidden messages.  But I'm not here to discuss that,let's get on with the review, shall we?

Episodes
All ninety of the syndicated episodes are found here.  The shows are presented with their original cliffhangers and lead-ins to get people interested in watching.  People have warned about episodes being cut, but to be honest, I can't see it.  Maybe it's because I watched them in reruns on local channels and then on tubetime.  The episodes play out the same way on this.
The characters are still as charming and quirky as ever, from the constantly wisecracking Benson, to the scatter brained Jessica, to the incredibly weird Chuck and Bob.  Each character works with teh next to make hte show as funny and memorable as possible.

Picture Quality:
Sometimes with older shows, the picture quality is bad and/or the quality of sound is sacrificed.  To be honest, the quality seems to be the same as it was on the television.

Packaging:
This is where a lot of people are complaining.  The disks are stacked on top of one another, which can lead to scratches.  Luckily enough, I was able to get some empty CD cases for very cheap and was able to repackage the set with no problem whatsoever.

Value:
Considering the seasons cost 20-24 dollars apiece, this was quite a deal at only thirty.  Sure, I had to repackage them, but at least the disks all work and the tales of scratching the disks turned out to be just folklore.

Closing Thoughts:
""Will Jessica find out about Chester's Affair?  Will Chester find out about Jessica's affair?  Will Benson find out about any affair?  Will Benson care?  Find out the answers to all these questions and more on the next episode of Soap.""",1276646400,3,1956,4.563218390804598

3160338,3,B0016MJ73M,"I bought this 12 disc set at Costco for only $19.99. Even at this price the quality of these shows is terrible. Almost like someone transfered shows they taped in 1977 to DVD. After reading that these are also edited and NOT complete I think I will have to regift this and wait for the Real Complete Shows. Good to know that next time this company has a DVD release to first do some research before buying the nex trelease.

The stacks of discs is so alarming I had to cut kleenex to layer each disc from touching and scratching each other. Too bad..but for the price it is a great deal if you just want to watch these at your own leasure and then sell them at a garage sale or re-gift them.

There is nothing like being taken for any amount of money. When they say complete they should just let us know what they couldn't include and for what reason. Then we can decide..""Well, if this is the only way we can have this show by cutting a few minutes here or a story line there then be it""...then WE can decide where we wish to blow our hard earned cash.",1273795200,2,1053,4.1568627450980395

It was so nice for me to see whole 4 seasons (I wasn't allowed to watch it back in the 70s because of the ""mature content"").  Although I don't disagree with some fo the comments like parts of the show missing (I always like to see the bonus materials on movies and shows) you can't have it all with a price like this.  As for the flimsy packaging I personally don't care about that because I believe that most DVD packaging is way over packaged anyways.  I'm just so happy to be able to see all the shows (and now my kids have watched it too - my how things have changed over the last 30 years).

3160360,5,B0016MJ73M,"At first, the video quality of the 70s classic sitcom is a bit off-putting, compared to the HD quality that we've come to know and love, but hey, it was shot in video back then and not much can be remastered to make it much better.  Nonetheless, the show is so well-written, cutting edge, even for today, and so funny that you'll soon get so engrossed in the story lines that you'll forget it's shot in crappy video.  Get ready to see a very young Billy Crystal shine as Jody, the gay character, along with a wacky cast that will have you laughing, crying, and watching episode after episode, even if you have other things to do, such as sleep!  Bravo to Susan Harris, the creator, producer, and writer of SOAP, for giving us this gem of a series to enjoy decades later.  Also, this slim package is a great value.  Yes, it is an inexpensive spindle style of packaging, but the discs are great quality and if given the choice, I'd still pick this economy packaging for all 4 discs combined than pay twice as much, collectively, to have each disc individually packaged.",1257033600,8,1067,4.479381443298969

HOWEVER, the packaging was absolutley horrendous!!!  They stacked all 6 discs one top the other, with no protectors, or sleeves of any kind to prevent dust or debris from getting in between them and damaging the discs.  I was OUTRAGED at the SLOPPY packaging of a classic series collection.  Just shoddy cardboard workmanship on the packaging all the way around.  Hopefully this would not be the case, for future product releases of SOAP.

We DID play all of the discs and they were in very good condition, but we IMMEDIATELY went out and purchased a disc binder with protective sleeves to preserve them.

I must say though, I really don't have a problem with the package as I wanted and purchased the content of the disc, not the package itself. I own a DVD jukebox, therefore the packaging is irrelevant as all discs are stored in the jukebox and the packaging is stored in the garage until I discard the discs.

They dealt with subjects that are still touchy and made their point with wonderful humor.

3160402,5,B0016MJ73M,"You know. Soap was an amazing show. It was a sitcom with some really great drama mixed in. It didn't matter what crazy and completely unrealistic scenarios the characters got themselves into because it was the characters themselves, not the storylines that mattered. Everyone was so lovable. Even guys like Chester who had a lot less good than bad to contribute were still just impossible to hate. I only wish they had finished.

It would've taken only one more hour long episode to tie up all the cliffhangers they left at the end of season four. That's all. I realize that it was common for TV shows to be canceled in a moments notice back then. But this was no ordinary show. Unlike most sitcoms of the time, it had running stories that progressed from show to show. They could've ended a show like Three's Company anytime they wanted. The characters never went anywhere since each episode was its own self-contained story. But Soap was different. We invested real time into these characters over four years. For the network to just pull the plug as they did was very disrespectful to the cast, crew and fans of the show. It's just a shame.

But, if I had to write an ending for the show, here's what it would be:

JESSICA: The gunshots heard at Jessica's execution were from El Puerco, Juan One, Billy, Saunders and Benson. That's right, Benson! They attacked the village and engaged in a gunfight with the executioners. El Puerco saves Jessica and stays behind to fight Sandy and his men.

BURT: Just as Burt is about to be killed by the mob, he disappears from sight having been beamed back to the alien ship by Saul. After the initial shock of the event, Saul explains that he felt compelled to save Burt even though that's not why they returned to Earth. The scare of nearly dying and being saved scares Burt straight. He realizes he's not the guy he's been pretending to be and he belongs with Mary. As Saul beams him back, Burt asks why the aliens have returned, but doesn't get an answer before he disappears.

CHESTER: Chester says goodbye to Danny and Annie, then pulls the trigger. But, it just clicks because he forgot to load the gun. He turns to get the bullets from his pocket. Danny grabs a vase and hits Chester over the head. Chester wobbles and falls. When he wakes up he can't remember who he is again. This condition offers grounds for Annie to get an annulment from Chester. So Danny and Annie are free to be together.

MARY: Burt returns, tells Mary what happened. She welcomes her Burt back and dumps out her booze in the sink.

JODY: Maggy can't take it anymore. As she says her final goodbye to Jody (Julius, that is), he walks up the stairs in the Campbell home, slips and falls down the steps. When Maggy runs to him, she notices he's normal again with no memory of Julius.

ENDING: Everyone meets over at the Tate house to welcome Jessica back. It's all hugs and smiles. Everyone's so happy to be Alive, well and together again. Just when it can't get any better, Corrine walks through the door. Jessica thanks the heavens for all these wonderful people in her life and is so happy to have the whole family back together again. Just then, the lights dim as the whole house shakes, colorful lights flash through the windows, that eerie sound Burt knows so well grows as the spaceship nears. Then, from the carriage, Scotty (Mary and Burt's baby) floats up into the air, then flies out the window like a bullet. The noise and lights go away, the house lights return to normal. A few moments of silence from the group. Then, Mary begins to chuckle. Everyone looks at her as the chuckle grows to an all out bellowing of laughter. Burt says, ""Uh Mare, what's so funny?"" She replies, ""I told you he flies"". The End.

So, that's what I would've done :)",1232928000,3,3777,4.5183016105417275

There is no doubt that the footage is dated but this only reflects the era and time, Soap managed to break taboos like the mob, homosexuality, lesbianism, sex, mental and family issues, it relects a time where America and the world was dealing with social changes.

began his career.  The characters are funny and, in the case of Jessica,

3160419,3,B0016MJ73M,"To me, TV shows, movies and music capture and reflect the times they were made and what I was doing back then.  Even though I was in my early teens when ""Soap"" was airing in Prime Time on ABC, there were fond memories of those times.  It was nice to see every episode that was aired, but what was missing from this set was season recaps that were aired at the beginning of each new season, especially the one where Jessica dies and goes up to the pearly gates and encounters Bea Arthur's character.  This along with the way the DVD set was packaged takes away from this experience.  It came in single box with a spindle where every Disc was stacked on top of each other instead of a jacket with each Disc in their own place or pocket.  It would have been nice to add more material behind the scenes as well as some of the background material behind the opposition to this TV show that wound up on shows like ""20/20"".

Growing up in Denver during the first two seasons of ""Soap"", much of the first season wound up being broadcast late at night after Prime Time for fear of the opposition to the storyline surrounding Jody Dallas.  This show, like the ""Medicine & Martini's Collection"" of ""MASH"" should be in anybody's TV DVD collection and treated like old friends.",1217808000,2,1264,4.399141630901288

I imagine that after one complete go round with the disks, they will probably be scratched and in need of replacement (undoubtedly the plan of the manufacturer).

3393730,1,B0016MJ73M,"SOAP is truly one of the best comedies of all time! Great actors (well acted as well), Great comedic timing, and great plot twists. So before I go any further, the show itself is a 5++ star rating.  This review is not about the show, but how the DVD set that is NOT COMPLETE and how the Studio who produce this (Sony/Columbia Tristar) have shown an injustice to a great T.V. Show.
As mentioned by a reviewer before me....the packaging is the worst of it's kind.  I already have the seasons sets (which the packaging is 100 times better), but I wanted to check the new complete series (online reviews and at Best Buy) to see if there is anything new/extra and or different than the season sets. The packaging is VERY FLIMSY. And it is as described by the prior reviewer in a spiral format (like you buy blank DVD's or CDs). Even tvshowsondvd.com gave it the worst packaging ever (see the following link for details on how bad the packaging is: [...] )
In addition to the bad packaging, both, the complete series and the individual season sets, the episodes have been cut. Each episode should run approximately 25 minutes.....some episodes have been cut down to 22-23 minutes. Why is this? Frankly, I don't know why?  The reason I do know they have been cut is I originally bought the VHS tapes from Columbia House years ago, and they were in the original ABC broadcast form. In particular to the first season, there used to be a ""parental discretion"" by the announcer in the beginning of the show.  Also, there is a scene in the first season with Jody (Billy Crystal) who is trying on Mary's clothes. That scene has been cut short.  The only thing I can think of why it was cut, is Jody is singing something while looking in the mirror (possible music rights? How petty can this be?).  But these episodes, in both the complete series and the individual season sets are NOT COMPLETE!!! For casual buyer of t.v. series, this may not bother you. But if you are a die hard fan of the show, like me, you may be very disappointed.  I suggest if you want the UNCUT VERSION of the series, look for the Columbia House Videos (there were a total of 23 videos) on Ebay and transfer them on DVD yourself.
Another problem, and the most annoying of all, is there are three 90 minute summer specials that are missing.  These specials were between season shows that featured Jessica (Katherine Helmond) and another character conversing about the season before (a clip show). ABC use to air these in the summer before the new season started to get the audience up to date. Because these specials were not included in the individual season sets, I thought, this Complete Series set would have them. NOT A CHANCE. They are the same exact discs as the individual season sets. Nothing is changed but the packaging. And even the season sets have only two extras (2nd Season Set Only). A very lame interview with the writers of the show and the pilot episode reprise (Hello, the pilot episode was on the First season set....why do we need it again on the 2nd season set???) In any case, the 90 minute specials would have been great addition for extras to this wonderful show. Only 2 of the 90 minute sp ecials can be found on VHS. The 1st 90 minute special (the summer special between the 1st and 2nd season), was released on VHS only and it's called ""The Best Of Soap: Who Killed Peter?"". This is where Burt visits Jessica in her jail cell after being found guilty of Peter's murder and they go over each character (thru clips) of who could have killed Burt's son, Peter. Another 90 minute special can be found on VHS only as well, (the summer special between the 3rd and 4th season). The VHS was released with the title name: ""The Best Of Soap: Jessica's Wonderful Life"".  This is where Jessica, after being in a coma, goes to heaven and visits an Angel (played by ""Golden Girl"" Bea Arthur). Jessica explains to the angel (once again thru clips) why she can't die and her family needs her.  The only 90 minute special that is not on VHS or DVD is the summer show between the 2nd and 3rd season.  This is where Jessica says goodbye to Benson (the butler, played by Robert Guillaume) who leaves the show to star in own series ""Benson"".  Jessica, once again, thru clips, converses with Benson about the events of the season before, and why he needs to stay.  Ironically enough, Mr. Guillaume went to star in his own show after this, however, he did come back in the first 3-4 episodes of the 3rd season. His return to Soap was to resolve a situation which involved saving the Tate's son Billy from a cult group called the Sunnies (Side note: this is a classic scene which featured Benson, Chester, the Major and Detective Donahue as the step brothers...hilarious!)  There is a scene in the beginning of the third season when Benson returns and Jessica shouts out ""Benson, your back!"". This may have confused some people who watch the DVD's wondering ""Back from where?"".  Later, Benson says goodbye for the second time during the 3rd season. These specials should have been on this release, but once again, the studios have disappointed the fans of this great sh ow!!
All and All, the show is still terrific (A Golden Classic) and it deserves 5 stars in itself. But there is two many wrongs with releasing the DVD's under false pretenses by the Studio. The episodes are not complete, the packaging (for the Complete Series only) stinks, and they are missing out on 3 of the 90 minute specials that would COMPLETE the entire run of the series. For the release of this DVD and the Studio who released it, only 1 star!  As for the buyers out there, if your only a casual fan of the series, it's fine, but buy the individual season sets. the packaging is so much better. Do not buy this one...you will eventually have to repackage the DVD's yourself because they will easily get scratched.  If you are a completest die hard fan of the show, either buy the complete unedited episodes on VHS tapes from Ebay or some other website and transfer them on DVD yourself OR wait for the Studio to wise up and get the REAL COMPLETE SET (Unedited episodes and the 90 minute specials) when they offer the series in another release. I will get off my SOAP box now!! I hope this helps the buyers out there. Thanks for reading.",1213142400,703,6282,4.515845070422535

3393754,5,B0016MJ73M,"This review is for Soap, the complete series.

Considering how the show was filmed in the 70s, the picture quality is exactly as I would expect it to be. To those complaining about it, what do you expect for a 1970s tv show?

I grew up as a child watching this show, and even as a small child I found it very funny and entertaining. This definitely is by no means a childs show, especially by todays standards of political correctness. I however understand that this show is all about humor, so make sure you understand the context of where it was coming from back in the day. You definitely won't find a show like this on TV now.

One word of warning, the product was shipped in an envelope and not a box causing it to get crushed and the dvd case damaged. I am awaiting a replacement which I hope won't be sent the same way.",1518652800,,826,4.215189873417722
3393755,3,B0016MJ73M,"The quality is good, easy to navigate the menus, etc. the only problem so far is the number of repeated episodes. For instance, the season ender for season 2 was copied onto the beginning of the season 3 disc, so you get it 2 times in a row. Think they could of paid more attention to those details. Otherwise, no complaints.",1518307200,,325,4.344262295081967

3393758,3,B0016MJ73M,First 3 seasons are funny.  By the last season you know why it lost favor with watchers.,1517443200,,88,4.176470588235294
3393759,1,B0016MJ73M,"What a great disappointment! First, let's start off with the packaging. All 8 disks had been packed on thin cardboard sleeves, (two disks per piece of cardboard), then put into this 'outer box', sticking out an inch at the bottom. That 'outer box' looks as if it was used for many different things besides 8 DVD disks. Most likely other television series that had various different numbers of disks in it. Since these 8 DVD disks only filled about half of that outer box, there was a spacer piece of cardboard, (piece double folded), put in there to try and take up the extra space. That's it...

Naturally, that extra piece if cardboard did little to  offer a suitable package for this set. Packaged in a padded envelope and sent through the postal service, it arrived 'crushed'!

The day this set arrived, (seeing this cheap, now crushed, unsuitable packaging), I went to the eBay site and ordered a special, hard plastic case, that holds 8 DVDs for this set. It cost me about $5.

Next, there are absolutely no features included with this collection. No special features, no subtitle options, no 'nothing'!

Still, I loved being taken way back to when these were in television. I was a huge fan, and enjoyed the series immensely. These days, it was a very  refreshing release for the day's stresses. Even though I had watched this in the past, I had seen no reruns since then, so it was almost like watching it for the very first time, all over again. Every new scene was like a surprise to me.

Naturally, as with all television programs, there was season finales, often with someone getting shot, or some other, 'cliff hanger', where you had to wait for the new season to see what happened. A nice advantage having all the seasons right there in front of you! No more waiting months for the next season.

Well, so I'm lost up in this episode, where not one if the stars happens to be in front of someone holding a gun, but 'three' of them!

I'm trying to think back, but my memory had failed me. I went to reach for the next disk, and there was none! That was the end of the 4th season. I looked at the packaging and it stated all 90 episodes were included, and that was the 90th episode.

What a disappointment! To leave such situations completely unanswered? Thats not right! These days when someone leaves a series, they leave in an episode, or they are at least killed off. Not back then... Don't know why this series wasn't continued with the popularity of it. Possibly there was just too much censorship back then. What a shame!",1517184000,2,2539,4.536105032822757
3393760,5,B0016MJ73M,"I could say a lot about this farcical ""soap opera"", but I think it has been very well covered on Wikipedia.  Just look up ""Soap TV Series"" and you'll learn all about it.  It was more than hysterical.  I looked forward to watching it every week.  Plot twists galore and every one filled with gut busting laughs.  Now I am a happy camper because I have all the shows and I'm having so much fun rewatching it all.  If you like to laugh, and who doesn't, I highly recommend this set of DVDs.

In fact, they don't have any special features of any kind.
They are simply the bare bones episodes themselves, which have obviously not been enhanced in anyway.
Adding insult to injury, when we informed the vendor that we were returning the product because of an error on the product page, they made it clear they really didn't care.

3394235,1,B0016MJ73M,"ABYSMAL ""New & Improved"" stiff cardboard sleeve packaging in a flimsy outer box as of December 2015. Half the discs are badly scratched. Not even worth seeking a replacement because half of the discs in that one will be scratched. Everybody and their brother knows that putting discs in cardboard sleeves is the absolute worst packaging possible. Your discs arrive scratched and will be scratched further every time you remove or replace the discs in them.

How is Mill Creek not aware of this? Guess they enjoy getting loads of product returned for refund, like mine will be. I don't pay new prices for scratched-up, used-looking junk. People complain about getting multi-disc sets on a spindle, but that's a DREAM compared to this. Those crummy paper sleeves with the cellophane window are better than this. Giving them a good slap shot across the carpet is better than this. Terrible job here, I will never buy any set from Mill Creek packaged like this because it is completely pointless, unless you're the type who uses DVDs for coasters anyway and won't mind the damage.",1449014400,8,1076,4.879781420765028

3394400,4,B0016MJ73M,"This is a series about two families, two sisters, Jessica Tate-the Tates (the rich) and Mary Campbell-the Campbells (the middle). I have just started Season 2 and this series is about a crazy mix of family characters and their dysfunctions with their butler Benson, who is continually sarcastic. There situations change from one episode to another but the basic problems remain. The writing made light of some of the more serious issues coming forth when this series was produced as well as general human weakness(s). I was in my teens when I first saw some of the episodes and laughed at many of the predicaments, situations, of these two seeming opposing families.
Season 1
The Tates (rich), the head of the family, Chester, is embezzling funds, cheating on his wife with whomever will let him, and is a murderer of the offending lover (tennis pro, Peter) of his wife, Jessica, and almost allows his wife to go to prison for the crime, until he confesses up. The grandfather (Jessica's father, the Major)) is out of his mind, living in the memory of his participation in WWII as an eternal soldier and always wears his uniform, hat and sword, ready in every situation with a military response, even crawling on the ground. Benson the Butler and cook, knows what a loony toon family he works for, does not like Chester and ignores him and the two daughters and the young son,  He doesn't like answering the door and sometimes decides not to cook, though Jessica he loves.
Jessica, seems innocent enough (she expresses herself as such) but understands more than she is given credit for, being a ""housewife"", ignorant of the ways of the world. Her affair with the tennis pro, Peter, her stepson, was due to her loneliness, as her husband Chester, is always ""working"" and never home, having an affair with his secretary. Her affair is brief, as she has a conscience of grief, of adultery, as she finds out that her neighbor and her daughter are also having the same lessons! With this, she ends it, and shortly thereafter he is killed in the shower and Corinne is the first to be arrested and goes to Jail.
Meanwhile, in a restaurant with her sister, she catches her husband with his secretary, who blackmails him. A lesson truly lived and learned. She now believes he does not love her and wants to separate. The daughter, Corinne, finds out what's really going on with her tennis ""pro"" and leaves him as well. But then her real mother, Ingrid appears. Now she just wants to be loved, and so goes after and entices a priest to leave the priesthood, gets permission, so he does and he asks her to marry him, and she says yes. Corinne's cousin, Eunice, is a journalist, and travels around, and likes to sleep around, with powerful men, and chooses Senators as her story. After Corinne's name is cleared, Jessica Tate is arrested for the murder. Chester tries to commit suicide and then remembers he killed the tennis pro, Peter.
Meanwhile, at the Campbells, the wife, Mary Campbell, learns that her son, Jodie, is gay (his lover is a pro quarterback), her son Danny thinks he's a real comedian as does Burt and Mary is just confused. Danny is in the mob and has been told he must kill his stepfather (news to him) for killing his father or else he'll be killed, so he dresses in disguise, as he can't go through with the killing and hides himself. Then Burt's long lost son, Chuck, comes to visit from Hollywood, with his schizophrenic ventriloquist doll, Bob, that he thinks is real. Burt is the killer of Mary's first husband, pushing him off a high construction ledge and goes into the hospital to cure his impotence and his ""invisible"" delusion, thinking that when he snaps his fingers he becomes invisible. He is cured of one, but not the other. Meanwhile, Jodie goes in for a sex change operation for his lover, but he tells Jodie's not get it because he is getting married so Jodie attempts suicide but fails and does not have the operation. Later, he gets involved with a female friend, separates from her, then goes away on a wknd trip, then moves in with her.

I have just started Season 2
The Tates
Jessica Tate is released.  Her lawyer told her he loves her and now that Chester is in jail, goes after her. Her husband says he loves her, before he confesses to the crime. Everyone was devastated with Jessica's verdict but not so much with Chester's, as they had blamed everyone in each family. Benson is glad Chester is gone and promises Jessica he will help the young son. Corinne comes home and chooses Jessica over her real mother. Ingrid, who helped to convict Jessica. Chester is forced to escape from jail by his cell mate, Dutch. Dutch forces the whole family into the basement to set rules.
The Campbells
Danny meets a mob princess, Elaine, and talks him into marrying her or her father will kill him. Carol tells Jodie she's pregnant. Father Tim's mother puts a curse on Corinne and Tim.  More to come.....",1441152000,,4925,4.63802978235968

3394448,2,B0016MJ73M,"I don't understand how a re-release of SOAP on DVD gets screwed up again. First, as others mentioned the discs were put in paper cases, something you would find for a game that would come with a computer from 1995. Now I was still willing to give this 4 or even 5 stars if this were a complete series but it's not.

Yes, they did add the intros and outros to every episode which is an improvement over the last complete series release. One episode is still the syndicated version but ok. However, the show is still missing entire scenes. The second half of the 4th season had hour long episodes. These episodes on the DVD are the syndicated versions (cut down to 30 minutes). I would have more than OK with that but the syndicated episodes cut out full scenes.

Most fans do not realize there are deleted scenes missing on the DVD because they grew up on SOAP in reruns or just don't remember. If you had the VHS sets from Columbia House you would have seen these deleted scenes. What's even more puzzling is that that there are three full hour episodes on the DVD set. These episodes were also split into 30 minute episodes for syndication. The set itself is very inconsistent.

SOAP is one my favorite shows and I would love to one day own the entire series on DVD with the 4th season having hour long episodes in their original form. Then again if you never knew these scenes were missing then you probably are willing to give the show 4 or 5 stars which for your purposes is cool.",1439510400,25,1484,4.369565217391305

Soap was filmed in front of live audiences so, the laughter is not ""canned"" and more contagious and spontaneous . It's still funny, but you have to crank back your mindset to a time before the ""political correctness"" that has numbed our senses and colored our lenses we see with today. The ""F"" word is not used, nor the ""B"" word for women, just good old humor.",1434844800,,520,4.316326530612245

3394568,3,B0016MJ73M,"When they announced the re-release of the complete series I was hoping for something a bit better. I've passed on buying the Complete set before because the reviews for the packaging was so bad. Should have kept waiting.

Rather than the spindle style case people complained about previously now it is just a big clunky box (snap open style like most DVD cases, twice as thick as the standard 6-disc cases) and inside *facepalm*... Inside of the front cover is just two parallel bumpers that fit to the outside of the inner  holder for the discs... The right panel that holds the discs is basically a four sided box that holds the discs, in their own individual... paper sleeves, yes, the dreaded paper sleeves. At the bottom of the box, on the inside edge, there are two tabs that you push down away from the sleeves to release the discs. Two of them had dislodged from the inner box and were loose in the case. Thankfully it doesn't appear to have caused any damage to the discs.

I'll have buy a 8-disc multi disc case to transfer the DVDs into, unfortunately due to the way they made the case cover, I'll have to redesign one to put in the new case, as the spine in this one will be far to wide for a slimmer case.

Bad design choice by the DVD production company, bad, bad design.

PS.... NO EPISODE BOOKLET / GUIDE :( :( :( :( There are 8 discs, 90 episodes and plenty of extra room in the case, is it too hard to print a quick little 2 page episode guide, so those of us that don't have the episode list memorized can know what is on each disc... the only thing they've go is on the discs that say Show #_ - Show #_, not helpful.",1433203200,16,1636,4.264516129032258

3394658,5,B0016MJ73M,"We watched this when it originally aired in the 70s, but have forgotten most of it so it's like watching it for the very first time.  Love it. We laughed out loud at something every episode.  There are serious subject matters here -
Billy Crystal as a gay single father trying to gain primary custody of his biological daughter,
Bert with his mental illness and belief he can be invisible,
Danny and Polly as an interracial couple (or as Danny stated, an ""intersexual couple.""

Like the TV show ""All in the Family"", some of the ""jokes"" are bigoted, i.e., ""Is Eunice an Indian giver?""
The clothes are seriously dated, but not all laughs are. We have enjoyed every episode better this second time around.

Note: To really appreciate how cutting edge this series was, start from the beginning. If you try to pick up on it half way through, it might appear just plain stupid. Not to say some of it isn't, but you recognize the wittiness of it when you get sucked in from ground one. ""Confused? You won't be after this week's episode of SOAP!""",1391212800,,1038,4.53475935828877

3394662,5,B0016MJ73M,This series is as funny as I remember it. It was well worth the money.  Very much ahead of itself in years. It is hard to think they got away with the adult content during those years.,1389052800,,184,3.972972972972973
3394663,5,B0016MJ73M,"Loved it.  Cutting edge comedy still funny after all these years.
Fun to see all of the characters again. Most of the comedy shows on TV today are soooo cheesy & not at all funny.",1388966400,,179,4.114285714285714
3394664,5,B0016MJ73M,"For those of us who remember the 70s Soap was a very controversial spoof of soap operas that in most markets aired late at night.  Younger viewers will laugh since it seems so tame now.

But many future stars cut their teeth on this show, and the over the top performances are a farceurs delight.  In one series, we have television's first openly gay character, humorous but heartfelt reactions to adultery, murder, alien abduction and demonic possession.  All done with a playful wink.  The series is well worth your time, and it is very easy to become addicted.

Now for the downside.  The DVD includes no special features, and episodes appear to be the cut broadcast episodes.  Prior to each season there was a 90 minute special featuring the characters and clips from the prior season.  Although the specials did not contain plotlines germane to the season they were quite creative and had some special moments.  The DVD package does not include them.

Spoiler warning-the series was intended to last 5 seasons but was unceremoniously cancelled after 4 leaving many storylines unresolved.  In the years since this time, the actors and writers have offered many suggestions as to what might have happened, but none was included.

Still the price is good and the slim packaging, though inconvenient is space efficient.  Since there is no real good DVD release of the series I would recommend this for no other reason than to see (not perfectly) a classic series.",1388534400,6,1464,4.874493927125506

3394666,5,B0016MJ73M,"Way before ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" made their viewers wait all summer to find out what happened to their favorite characters ""Soap"" started the ""prime time cliffhanger"" to much success. Before a single episode was aired there was much controversy about ""Soap"" as religious groups pleaded with ABC not to carry the program as they felt the series was depicting people with no morals in terms of sex, life and love. ""Soap"" was really (before ""Dynasty"") the first network series to explore homosexuality in an open manner, albeit not to the greatest of its ability. Still, the show became a huge hit for the network in a comfortable Tuesday night time slot airing after the then popular ""Three's Company"". The show also made Billy Crystal a household name.

 This set is exceptional with every episode of the series in their entirety, uncut and without commercials. The shows look surprisingly good although it was shot on cheap videotape as compared to film.

 The outright star was Katherine Helmond who played Jessica, a combination of Rose Nyland and Edith Bunker, someone the viewers loved. The series won Emmys for Catherine Damon and Richard Mulligan.

 Early guest-stars who popped up on ""Soap"" were Ted Shakelford, hunky Robert Urich and Dinah Manoff.",1388275200,2,1256,5.043478260869565

Hilarity to the extreme but touches lots of subjects that may have not been a comedy ie homosexuality.  This is very tastefully done and is done seriously good for a comedy.  The writers take on some deadly subjects ie rascism, sexual promiscuity, affairs, all subjects are tastefully done and pull on the heart strings.  The more serious the subject the more deftly handled with some atrosiusly good wit.  The comedy does not laugh at people but always with them.

I did read other reviews about packaging and missing content, but since she wasn't around for the first run of the show, she doesn't know what she is missing.

3394745,5,B0016MJ73M,"I never watched this show much when it was on the air, but someone I used to date was really into it.  Now I've been catching up with all the episodes on Netfix, and can honestly say that this show was downright funny with all its twists and turns.  You start watching it, and you get hooked.  With a fabulous twist on daytime dramas that haven't changed all that much--except the plots move 10 times faster--this show is a must for anyone who likes their comedy both sympathetic to likable, outlandish characters and surprisingly fresh and witty.  Even after all these years, the topics of adultery, crime, and sexual controversy are still universal, and there isn't a storyline on here that won't appeal to somebody who picks up on the show's approach.

Cudos to the late Richard Mulligan, Katherine Helmond, and Robert Guilluame for playing their roles so very well, not to mention Billy Crystal, ventriloquist Jay Johnson,  and Ted Waas.  This show is so much fun to get sucked into, and it amazes me how creator and writer Susan Harris could keep coming up with something new and crazy for 90 episodes, because I don't think I could do it past three.  Talk about creativity!  When you consider this show the springboard that launched other hit shows such as Benson, Empty Nest, Who's the Boss, and Golden Girls, you will also recognize that a lot of the people behind the scenes of this show were also responsible for the ones that followed.  I call that a raving success, wouldn't you?  Beside that, you can't help but love Helmond's ditzy, sweet Jessica who I think is the central glue of the entire show.",1329350400,2,1612,4.660777385159011

They knew that Billy Crystal was taking a major risk with his career playing a gay son. This was unheard of. Though I can't remember his real name, the role of Bensen was excellent. He received so much slack for being a butler. But not only did he do it well, he pulled it off with so much decorum and class. He was the only sane member of complete ensemble. That's why he received his own series after two years of being on Soap. I would buy the series, but there is only one season and I know there were at least two or three seasons.

3394763,4,B0016MJ73M,"The show itself is 5 stars, and definitely in line with some of the best comedies ever made.

Regarding the packaging - an issue that seems to appear on many of the negative reviews - I personally find it adequate, even if there are better arrangements on the market.

I wouldn't call it, as others suggested, ""the worst packaging ever"". That title should be kept for the ""M*A*S*H the Martinis and Medicine Collection"". which is by far the worst packaging I've seen so far (also, alas, for a 5 star show...)

The upside of the package is that it does protect the discs well during shipping, and the downside is that it's less convenient if you use them a lot.

The one star deduction is due to it's total lack of extras and subtitles.

I'm a non-English speaker, and as such I found (along with my children) certain parts hard to understand especially Bob's lines...

I hope some day a more complete and sleek edition will be produced for all of the show's fans out there.",1323475200,,972,4.494318181818182

3394765,5,B0016MJ73M,"I must say I was a little apprehensive about ordering Soap: The Complete Series (Slim Packaging) 12-Disc set after reading all of the negative reviews.
However, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it in the mail.
The 12 discs were stacked on top of one another (as stated in other reviews) inside a disc shaped recessed plastic holder. Then a piece of disc shaped corrugated cardboard was pressed firmly into place on top of the 12 discs to prevent them from moving around in transit.
And the entire recessed plastic holder w/discs was wrapped inside shrinkwrap. This was slid inside the cardboard outer cover which was also wrapped in shrinkwrap.  I found the packaging to be very adequate.

I inspected the surface of each of the 12 discs and found no defects or surface scratches.  As of this review I've viewed only Disc #1 from the First Season of Soap, and I find the picture and sound quality to be very acceptable, taking into account these are transfers from video tape and long before HDTV came along. I feel $30 for all four seasons of Soap is a steal.  If I ever lost my 12-Disc Set of Soap: The Complete Series (Slim Packaging)...

Richard Mulligan and Dinah Manoff (Empty Nest), Katherine Helmond and Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), Robert Guillaume and Inga Swenson (Benson).

The cast is great and the acting is top notch. The last time I watched was when it first aired and the occasional rerun. I hate watching reruns unless I watch from episode one so I waited patiently for it to become available on DVD. I guess I can't claim to be an expert on the show and I didn't buy the individual seasons since I was waiting for the prices to drop. When I saw this all in one, I thought it was a good opportunity to get the whole set. I agree with other reviewers that this is very cheap packaging. I don't like the menus and the picture quality is not befitting such a great show, it definitely deserves better treatment. One of the discs also had a circular defect on the printed side.

3394831,4,B0016MJ73M,"As a child of the 80s, I grew up watching reruns of Soap on television.  Though I didn't get a lot of the jokes, I thought that Benson and Jessica were by far the funniest, and I became a fan of the series.  Now that I'm older, I can watch the show for its social commentary and hidden messages.  But I'm not here to discuss that,let's get on with the review, shall we?

Episodes
All ninety of the syndicated episodes are found here.  The shows are presented with their original cliffhangers and lead-ins to get people interested in watching.  People have warned about episodes being cut, but to be honest, I can't see it.  Maybe it's because I watched them in reruns on local channels and then on tubetime.  The episodes play out the same way on this.
The characters are still as charming and quirky as ever, from the constantly wisecracking Benson, to the scatter brained Jessica, to the incredibly weird Chuck and Bob.  Each character works with teh next to make hte show as funny and memorable as possible.

Picture Quality:
Sometimes with older shows, the picture quality is bad and/or the quality of sound is sacrificed.  To be honest, the quality seems to be the same as it was on the television.

Packaging:
This is where a lot of people are complaining.  The disks are stacked on top of one another, which can lead to scratches.  Luckily enough, I was able to get some empty CD cases for very cheap and was able to repackage the set with no problem whatsoever.

Value:
Considering the seasons cost 20-24 dollars apiece, this was quite a deal at only thirty.  Sure, I had to repackage them, but at least the disks all work and the tales of scratching the disks turned out to be just folklore.

Closing Thoughts:
""Will Jessica find out about Chester's Affair?  Will Chester find out about Jessica's affair?  Will Benson find out about any affair?  Will Benson care?  Find out the answers to all these questions and more on the next episode of Soap.""",1276646400,3,1956,4.563218390804598
3394832,5,B0016MJ73M,"I LOVE Soap! I remember watching it in my younger years with my Mom. We never missed an episode! I was so thrilled to find the complete series on DVD!

I bought it for the DVDs! I took the DVDs out of the box and placed them individually in Thin Jewel cases! I am so happy that I finally have the complete series!

3394835,3,B0016MJ73M,"I bought this 12 disc set at Costco for only $19.99. Even at this price the quality of these shows is terrible. Almost like someone transfered shows they taped in 1977 to DVD. After reading that these are also edited and NOT complete I think I will have to regift this and wait for the Real Complete Shows. Good to know that next time this company has a DVD release to first do some research before buying the nex trelease.

The stacks of discs is so alarming I had to cut kleenex to layer each disc from touching and scratching each other. Too bad..but for the price it is a great deal if you just want to watch these at your own leasure and then sell them at a garage sale or re-gift them.

There is nothing like being taken for any amount of money. When they say complete they should just let us know what they couldn't include and for what reason. Then we can decide..""Well, if this is the only way we can have this show by cutting a few minutes here or a story line there then be it""...then WE can decide where we wish to blow our hard earned cash.",1273795200,2,1053,4.1568627450980395

It was so nice for me to see whole 4 seasons (I wasn't allowed to watch it back in the 70s because of the ""mature content"").  Although I don't disagree with some fo the comments like parts of the show missing (I always like to see the bonus materials on movies and shows) you can't have it all with a price like this.  As for the flimsy packaging I personally don't care about that because I believe that most DVD packaging is way over packaged anyways.  I'm just so happy to be able to see all the shows (and now my kids have watched it too - my how things have changed over the last 30 years).

I wanted to buy my wife the Love Boat Series and it's priced well over $100 - that's crazy.  Instead this series was very reasonably priced and my whole family enjoyed the hours and hours of entertainment.  I highly recommend this series.",1270857600,,954,4.129729729729729

3394857,5,B0016MJ73M,"At first, the video quality of the 70s classic sitcom is a bit off-putting, compared to the HD quality that we've come to know and love, but hey, it was shot in video back then and not much can be remastered to make it much better.  Nonetheless, the show is so well-written, cutting edge, even for today, and so funny that you'll soon get so engrossed in the story lines that you'll forget it's shot in crappy video.  Get ready to see a very young Billy Crystal shine as Jody, the gay character, along with a wacky cast that will have you laughing, crying, and watching episode after episode, even if you have other things to do, such as sleep!  Bravo to Susan Harris, the creator, producer, and writer of SOAP, for giving us this gem of a series to enjoy decades later.  Also, this slim package is a great value.  Yes, it is an inexpensive spindle style of packaging, but the discs are great quality and if given the choice, I'd still pick this economy packaging for all 4 discs combined than pay twice as much, collectively, to have each disc individually packaged.",1257033600,8,1067,4.479381443298969

HOWEVER, the packaging was absolutley horrendous!!!  They stacked all 6 discs one top the other, with no protectors, or sleeves of any kind to prevent dust or debris from getting in between them and damaging the discs.  I was OUTRAGED at the SLOPPY packaging of a classic series collection.  Just shoddy cardboard workmanship on the packaging all the way around.  Hopefully this would not be the case, for future product releases of SOAP.

We DID play all of the discs and they were in very good condition, but we IMMEDIATELY went out and purchased a disc binder with protective sleeves to preserve them.

Hopefully, you'll have a good idea of what to expect with the purchase of this set.  Good Luck! :)",1254528000,8,914,4.727848101265823

I must say though, I really don't have a problem with the package as I wanted and purchased the content of the disc, not the package itself. I own a DVD jukebox, therefore the packaging is irrelevant as all discs are stored in the jukebox and the packaging is stored in the garage until I discard the discs.

3394899,5,B0016MJ73M,"You know. Soap was an amazing show. It was a sitcom with some really great drama mixed in. It didn't matter what crazy and completely unrealistic scenarios the characters got themselves into because it was the characters themselves, not the storylines that mattered. Everyone was so lovable. Even guys like Chester who had a lot less good than bad to contribute were still just impossible to hate. I only wish they had finished.

It would've taken only one more hour long episode to tie up all the cliffhangers they left at the end of season four. That's all. I realize that it was common for TV shows to be canceled in a moments notice back then. But this was no ordinary show. Unlike most sitcoms of the time, it had running stories that progressed from show to show. They could've ended a show like Three's Company anytime they wanted. The characters never went anywhere since each episode was its own self-contained story. But Soap was different. We invested real time into these characters over four years. For the network to just pull the plug as they did was very disrespectful to the cast, crew and fans of the show. It's just a shame.

But, if I had to write an ending for the show, here's what it would be:

JESSICA: The gunshots heard at Jessica's execution were from El Puerco, Juan One, Billy, Saunders and Benson. That's right, Benson! They attacked the village and engaged in a gunfight with the executioners. El Puerco saves Jessica and stays behind to fight Sandy and his men.

BURT: Just as Burt is about to be killed by the mob, he disappears from sight having been beamed back to the alien ship by Saul. After the initial shock of the event, Saul explains that he felt compelled to save Burt even though that's not why they returned to Earth. The scare of nearly dying and being saved scares Burt straight. He realizes he's not the guy he's been pretending to be and he belongs with Mary. As Saul beams him back, Burt asks why the aliens have returned, but doesn't get an answer before he disappears.

CHESTER: Chester says goodbye to Danny and Annie, then pulls the trigger. But, it just clicks because he forgot to load the gun. He turns to get the bullets from his pocket. Danny grabs a vase and hits Chester over the head. Chester wobbles and falls. When he wakes up he can't remember who he is again. This condition offers grounds for Annie to get an annulment from Chester. So Danny and Annie are free to be together.

MARY: Burt returns, tells Mary what happened. She welcomes her Burt back and dumps out her booze in the sink.

JODY: Maggy can't take it anymore. As she says her final goodbye to Jody (Julius, that is), he walks up the stairs in the Campbell home, slips and falls down the steps. When Maggy runs to him, she notices he's normal again with no memory of Julius.

ENDING: Everyone meets over at the Tate house to welcome Jessica back. It's all hugs and smiles. Everyone's so happy to be Alive, well and together again. Just when it can't get any better, Corrine walks through the door. Jessica thanks the heavens for all these wonderful people in her life and is so happy to have the whole family back together again. Just then, the lights dim as the whole house shakes, colorful lights flash through the windows, that eerie sound Burt knows so well grows as the spaceship nears. Then, from the carriage, Scotty (Mary and Burt's baby) floats up into the air, then flies out the window like a bullet. The noise and lights go away, the house lights return to normal. A few moments of silence from the group. Then, Mary begins to chuckle. Everyone looks at her as the chuckle grows to an all out bellowing of laughter. Burt says, ""Uh Mare, what's so funny?"" She replies, ""I told you he flies"". The End.

So, that's what I would've done :)",1232928000,3,3777,4.5183016105417275

There is no doubt that the footage is dated but this only reflects the era and time, Soap managed to break taboos like the mob, homosexuality, lesbianism, sex, mental and family issues, it relects a time where America and the world was dealing with social changes.

Though at times deep and serious issues are dealt with, your sure to be hit with some funny side of the serious too. At 94 shows in the series it will take some time to end your saga with Soap.

Confused? You won't be after this weeks Soap.  :)",1225152000,,749,4.253521126760563

funnier than alot that's on t.v. nowadays. would recommend it to anyone who likes lots of good belly laughs.
it's just too bad that the series ended leaving so many story lines hanging.",1221868800,,259,4.416666666666667
3394915,4,B0016MJ73M,"""Soap"", a parody of all soap operas, from the 1980's, is a gentle and
irreverant satire.  It's also fun to look back and see how Billy Crystal
began his career.  The characters are funny and, in the case of Jessica,
played by Katherine Helmond, sweet and pure at heart. You watch ""Soap"",
and really miss what a good sitcom was made of: satire and one-liners
and a dash of heart. ""Cheers"" is similar, but with a little more pungent
one-liners.",1220054400,,442,4.5125
3394916,3,B0016MJ73M,"To me, TV shows, movies and music capture and reflect the times they were made and what I was doing back then.  Even though I was in my early teens when ""Soap"" was airing in Prime Time on ABC, there were fond memories of those times.  It was nice to see every episode that was aired, but what was missing from this set was season recaps that were aired at the beginning of each new season, especially the one where Jessica dies and goes up to the pearly gates and encounters Bea Arthur's character.  This along with the way the DVD set was packaged takes away from this experience.  It came in single box with a spindle where every Disc was stacked on top of each other instead of a jacket with each Disc in their own place or pocket.  It would have been nice to add more material behind the scenes as well as some of the background material behind the opposition to this TV show that wound up on shows like ""20/20"".

Growing up in Denver during the first two seasons of ""Soap"", much of the first season wound up being broadcast late at night after Prime Time for fear of the opposition to the storyline surrounding Jody Dallas.  This show, like the ""Medicine & Martini's Collection"" of ""MASH"" should be in anybody's TV DVD collection and treated like old friends.",1217808000,2,1264,4.399141630901288

3394918,5,B0016MJ73M,"This is seriously one of the funniest comedy series of all time. It takes the rise out of all the soap opera's of the time, and many of the modern days ones too. I was never a soap opera fan, but I loved the way this programme ridiculed the behaviour of the characters in them. If you've got a better (or worse) half thats addicted to soap opera's, you could go further wrong than to introduce them to the ups and downs, highs and lows, trials and tribulations of the Tates and the Campbells. I'm sure that even if they weren't that keen, you'd be more than happy to indulge in these wonderful episodes.

Confused? You won't be if you buy the DVD's.",1216252800,,649,4.276422764227642
3394919,5,B0016MJ73M,"It is hard to go back 30 years and find the same things funny, but I had never watched Soap when it was on.  It is still funny, in a slap stick kind of way.  And what they got away with then.  It was  a simplier time.",1215993600,,217,3.5531914893617023

3394922,2,B0016MJ73M,"I was about to purchase the individual seasons of Soap, one of my favorite television series, when I saw this release scheduled.  I mistakenly assumed that it was like the individual seasons, just grouped together.  Boy oh boy was I wrong.  Talk about a no frills, no bells and whistles set.  I imagine that after one complete go round with the disks, they will probably be scratched and in need of replacement (undoubtedly the plan of the manufacturer).  As bad as the package is, I would have given a higher rating if I did not feel as if I was missing something while watching the disks.  I felt that they were too short in length (22 minutes is the standard for 30 minute shows when in reruns, meaning that each show should be approximately 25 minutes in length).  Seeing the reviews of another poster have confirmed my suspicions.  I am truly disappointed at being cheated out of my money and memories.",1214784000,11,907,4.590062111801243

8263177,5,B0016MJ73M,Late 70s sitcom poking fun at SOAP OPERA storylines. This is Billy Crystal in his early years. He is fantastic. I also recommend buying BENSON as a follow up. Born in the 70s and grew up through the 80s & 90s.. This provides much needed nostalgia for me.,1523750400,,254,4.3125
