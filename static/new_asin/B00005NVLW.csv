7947869,5,B00005NVLW,"Like so many of the films of Everett Lewis, a gay indie film producer whose for whose movies I am coming to have a real passion (an intense interest that aspires to be completist, although only some of his films are available on DVD or VHS). This one from 1990 (of which Strand Releasing`s publication on VHS tape is copyrighted 1994) is about two brothers` growing love and fierce attachment to each other, which gradually becomes sexualised as the younger of the two (Chris, played by Charlie Bean) falls, hard, with  love that includes sexual desire, for his elder brother (Lance, acted by B. Wyatt) who has the charge of him (paid for by their absent, uncaring father), who in turn surprises himself at how much affection he is developing for Chris. There is no explicit depiction of the carnality of the brotherly, incestuous love, and, indeed, many viewers, especially clueless heterosexuals, might never sense its presence in the film. There is a lot of nudity (almost never quite clearly visible when full frontal) and playfulness when one or both of the brothers is, or are, naked, whether as near-nude (shirtless or wearing only white briefs) or fully nude, or when dressed.

The real depth of the love of Chris and Lance for each other, and the increasingly sexualised nature of it, most clearly suggests itself in a conversation in which bisexual, ""hunky"" Lance tries to explain to boyishly willowy Chris, when the lad has seen Lance cavort amourously with his girlfriend, that he (and men generally) can have relations with women, and behave with them, in ways that two men cannot with each other, and vice-versa, something that Chris cannot accept easily. The two young men spend a lot of time on the road, variously alone or together, in the general Los Angeles area and further out in Southern California and even across the border in Tijuana, making Chris` attendance at high school continuingly erratic. The California terrain, urban and natural, are a joy to behold when filmed so evocatively as this.

The danger of Lance`s illegal dealings in drugs and weapons (with neo-nazis with whose cause, political and inchoately existential, he embraces in his own fuzzy way) eventually leads both to rather serious gun wounds for Chris, and, only a little later, fatal ones for Lance. The illegal activity that had landed Chris in trouble (to which he reverts) with the law is theft of vintage automobiles (hence the title of the movie). At the end of the film Chris, now forever bereft of his brother, boards a bus headed to nowhere important in particular, to continue his life, the wiser for some experience and wisdom hard-gained.

If the action of the film seems to lack focus, that surely is intentional, reflecting the meaninglessness of life around the brother and also as they live it themselves and travel constantly without much forethought. Only the bond that unites these brothers has any real meaning to them or to the viewer, so expecting a logically unfolding plot is counter-productive to appreciating the film. The mono sound on the VHS tape conveying the characters` conversation is not very clear, which certainly did not aid comprehension. Visually, the images on the screen, although gratifyingly clear and vivid, shake about on the screen at times, at least on the copy viewed. Despite the low budget on which Everett Lewis directed it, the b&w images often are very striking, the camera work as fine as could be obtained with such limited means.

It is advisable to search out information on, and interpretations, however brief, on this film before viewing it, which will facilitate comprehension as it progresses along seemingly aimlessly but, really, very effectively. This motion picture is not an ""easy view"" but it provides a most enriching cinematic experience, as Everett Lewis` films, each in its own way, always do so.",1341792000,,3864,4.95679012345679
