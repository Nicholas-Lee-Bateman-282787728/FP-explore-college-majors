8752895,1,B01CF3EMN0,"Every other word was the F-bomb.  Sometimes it was 5 or 7 times in a row.  Even if the language had been cleaned up and the vocabulary increased, the screenplay was lacking miserably.  The storyline is not all that bad - it just got into the wrong hands.  It could have been a good, funny, entertaining and adventurous movie but they ruined it.  It's not even going on the shelf.",1471737600,10,379,4.357142857142857
