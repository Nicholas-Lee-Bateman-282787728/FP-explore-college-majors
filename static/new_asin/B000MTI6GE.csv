8172250,3,B000MTI6GE,I was very excited when I found this copy of this movie because as a child this was one of my favorite movies to watch. I watched it on VHS of course and wanted a DVD version for my daughter. However when watching it with her I was extremely disappointed to find out that 2 songs were completely cut out and at least 2 others were cut short. The movie is not the same because of all the cuts and is not as enjoyable. I am quite upset with that...I am glad it did not cost me a whole lot. Though I am sick and tired of my childhood things being ruined by people redoing them or editing them just keep them how they were.,1294358400,4,619,3.96

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

This was a movie I had on VHS when I was a little kid. The last time I saw this was when I was maybe 6 years old, I'm 19 now. I had no idea it was DVD until i looked it up on here. I had to have it right away. It's just as good as when I was little. This is a magical film that every kid, and even adult, should see. The animation may seem bad to some, but this was made in the early 80's. The characters are real colorful and the music is lively. It really sends an imporntat message about being yourself and that anything is possible. Give it at least 1 chance, you won't be dissapointed.",1186963200,4,751,3.7531645569620253
