8232604,1,B0002OXV78,"This is a remake with a new title of Urla's NYStyle Pilates dvds and videos released earlier this year on this very site.  As a Pilates instructor who studied with Romana it is clear that this is far from the 'real deal' Urla claims it to be on his description.  While the settings and actors are 'pretty', the  constantly skewed camera angles are distracting as is the music.  There are drags on the tape and obvious voice over corrections that add to the distraction of constant cuts of the camera shots. He claims to be a seasoned instructor, who should know that clear and simple makes Pilates easier and more effective.  I'm not a big fan of Windsor Pilates, as they look for a shortcut to fitness, but this is the other extreme - too much talking and not enough workout.",1099785600,3,776,4.475177304964539
8232605,5,B0002OXV78,"This is hands down the absolute best Pilates workout around. I've tried Windsor Pilates and other programs and ended up giving the DVD's away because I was not satisfied. Jonathan Urla is a stellar instructor. I'm sure all of his ""Yogilates"" products are awesome. And I know how hard it is to develop a comprehensive workout program as a former aerobics instructor. Jonathan Urla has nailed it!  I'm a newly converted Urla-holic now. Thank you Jonathan for something that actually works the minute you hit play.",1096329600,4,511,4.941860465116279
