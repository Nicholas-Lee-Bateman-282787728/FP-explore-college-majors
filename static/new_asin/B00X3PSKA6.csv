Ghost hunting has taken on a life of its own in the past few years. It truly began with several documentary style programs on networks like the History Channel and USA before being dominated by programs like GHOST HUNTERS and GHOST ADVENTURES. Of those two Im a fan of GHOST HUNTERS where they try to debunk more than confirm the troubles of clients who fear that their locations are haunted. Yes, they occasionally find true hauntings and also the odd EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) but they treat it with respect and find nothing frightening for most involved.

As the ghost hunting shows have moved on to various ghost hunting programs the ones that started it all have fallen by the wayside. Some still show on the various networks where they once held sway but for the most part they don't get much attention. In truth that could be a good thing. Case in point this release.

Dont get me wrong, Im not saying they don't deserve some attention or that they don't offer some information at all but the method they use to do so leaves much to be desired. Ive never been a big fan of the recreation style film making technique that these programs use. The actors chosen to portray the real people one, never look at all like the people they're portraying and two, are most often the poorest actors ever committed to film. If this doesnt bother you then my guess is youll love this DVD set.

The two disc set offers just over 5 hours of programming from History Channel programs MONSTERQUEST, VOODOO SECRETS, IN SEARCH OF HISTORY, THE UNEXPLAINED and DECODING THE PAST. And while the title of the disc is Poltergeists, the truth is the set covers several topics like voodoo, the Salem witch trials, exorcisms as well as hauntings, ghosts and poltergeists. So if all you want is poltergeists at least 3 of the episodes should satisfy you.

As I said most of these programs combined poorly re-enacted events from the past or from witnesses joined with commentary made by scholars, researchers or paranormal personalities. They do give some interesting information on most and do a great job of letting you know the basics of each topic. The problem lies in all looking alike, sounding alike and every one using the most overdone spooky music heard in any program made, including the old AIP drive in spooky movies.  If that doesnt bother you then again, you will be satisfied with this collection.

The entertainment value in something like this will hold up for children and pre-teens or the less discerning viewer. But fans of the current lineup of ghost hunting programs will find most of these lacking. And if you are strictly adhering to the title, the inclusion of other topics may be a turn off for you. Im guessing if you have an interest in the topic at hand then youve seen some of these program and already know what Im talking about. If not the descriptions Ive tried to offer should let you know what youll be seeing should you pick a copy of this up.

As for myself Ill continue to watch and enjoy GHOST HUNTERS. Ive given up on GHOST ADVENTURES since it feels more like frat boys trying to goad ghosts and entities into a brawl on the front lawn (honestly having met and talked with Aaron Godwin from the show he seems nice enough but host Zach Bagans at the convention I went to seemed uninterested in his fans or talking with others about ghost hunting so maybe that clouds my judgement a bit as well). When it comes to this title I think Ill pass. Watching it through once was more than enough for me.",1440547200,3,3576,4.5765625
