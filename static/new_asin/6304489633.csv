892908,4,6304489633,"When Rocko's Modern Life came out in 1993, I was excited. I have to really admit, it remains as one of my favorite cartoons Nickelodeon has aired in the past few years. The humor within it is just plain peachy, with a hint of spice inside from the walaby from Austrailia. One of the things that Rocko can alwasy count on in the way, is his friend Heffer. Although their relationship as friends might seem a little bit strange, the humor is worth the wait in food Heffer eats.
The First Edition of With Friends Like These... reflects Rocko and Heffer getting into some of the strangest scenarios you'd ever expect to see. Take the first cartoon, Bedfellows. In this cartoon, Heffer moves into Rocko's home, after his family rented out his room. As a result, the two friends seem to be the complete opposite of the Odd Couple. It gets a little bit worse when Heffer invites a whole bunch of nudists into Rocko's home, without the walaby's permission. Will it destroy their friendship? You'll have to see and find out.
The second cartoon, No Pain, No Gain... showcases Rocko and Heffer entering a health spa to get their lives and their figures back into shape. But for the two of them, it makes it a little harder, especially when Heffer relaxes a little too much. It makes the two of them lose a little bit more than they bargained for. It even comes worse, when Heffer and Rocko take a one-on-one game of Basketball, and as Heffer makes a slam dunk, he knocks over a wall. On the other side of the wall, were people that were trying to take a shower.
The last episode, The Good, The Bad, and The Wallaby... is one of my favorites. In this cartoon, Rocko and Heffer go to Uncle Gib, Rocko's Uncle of course. Heffer feels an itch of living with cattle, where Rocko tries to learn about the real trade of traits, as he tries to finally be a cowboy. The test come into play a little bit harder, where Rocko has to try to save Heffer from being sold for food to market.
It is just a shame that Nickelodeon has stopped airing these cartoons anymore. No doubt about it, they are still as funny as anything else that should be popular on television right now. Hopefully, the orange network will air another few new ones to the mix.",1050192000,17,2223,4.424390243902439

892911,5,6304489633,"yo...i just ordered rockos modern life on amazon. this was one of my favorite tv shows of all times. my friends and i love to talk about past episodes all the time. all the kids who are growin up with spongebob don't know what they missed with rockos modern life. it is by far one of my top three shows (the others being the simpsons and south park). so naturaly im mad at nick for taking it off full time. who knows mabey theyll bring it back like tiny toons or ren and stimpy. i hope so. yo, all you rocko fans out there know what im talking about. alright in closing nick please bring rocko BACK... peace out",1041465600,2,611,4.142857142857143
892912,5,6304489633,"The worst events in history:
1. The day I realized all of the days hoping for Tribes 2 were in vain (i.e.: The day I got it
2. The day of my tonsilectonmy (and the pain-filled week following thus)
3. When Nickelodeon took ""Rocko's Modern Life"" off the air
Ask any one who grew up from c. 1990-1995 about ""Rocko's Modern Life"" and you're bound to get a smile, at the very least. I loved this show when I was growing up or its outrageous jokes that were semi-gross, but not to ""Ren and Stimpy"" levels(another classic Nicktoon)and just poked fun at life. My favorite episodes include the one where Rocko wants to make a video for his parents, but it ends up becoming art-house erotica, and the one where Rocko and Hefer go to see some momument or other and get into crazy adventures. (""Sir, there aren't enough pigs in the entire Earth.""--inside joke (I probably [messed[ up that quote, sorry)) For a while, I went to bed really early to get up to watch ""Rocko"" on Nick at about 5:00 AM, when they play all the old cartoons, leading to much sleepiness, but it was worth it. This show has so much humor, I've forgotten just how funny it was. I'll soon be reminded once I order a couple of these videos. And maybe we can hope Nick will do what Cartoon Netork did, and air reruns of all the old shows on a separate network. Ah, if only....",1033862400,2,1333,4.314741035856573

892914,4,6304489633,"Roko's Modern Life was always my favorite Nicktoon. Of course I didn't realize how bad some of the jokes were until after I bought it on casset recently. I was laughing at a joke and then I would think to myself, ""Whoa, was that always in there?"" Despite my suprise at some of the more adult jokes in the cartoon I was very happy. The VHS has I think five episodes. Oh and for those of you who never watched Rocko before. Rocko is a Wallaby who works in a comic book store. It's just about hitting the real world, with slight exadurations.",1022544000,,539,4.242718446601942
892915,5,6304489633,"I loved the Rocko's Modern Life Cartoon Series, and this tape contains a small fraction of the top-great episodes.  I could have made a better one, but for what they have made, I like this one the best.  Classic Nick cartoons will always hold a place in my heart.",1018396800,,263,4.346938775510204
892916,5,6304489633,"Im 22 years old and thought I lost my love for cartoons.  I have to say im not a big fan anymore, and am a sick of Rugrats this and Rugrats that.  However I was flipping through the channels when the funniest cartoon caught my eye. ROCKOS MODERN LIFE.  Rocko is a wallabe who is experiencing life on his own for the first time.  He runs into hilarious hijinks along the way.  There are so many interesting characters like Hefer {who is a slob} and Filburt {a turtle with attitude}.  The voices are very funny to listen to.  This is one of my favorite episodes.  One instant Rocko and Hefer go to work out, but Hefer cant keep his mind of his stomache.  Rocko tries his best to be discreet about working out but his big friend always attracts attention.  Take a chance and buy this one...",978480000,2,787,4.292517006802721

7873285,5,6304489633,"Rocko's Modern Life was without a doubt my favorite show to watch during the 90s. It's a shame that Nick took it off the air along with other cartoons. I always love to watch it whenever I can catch it running occasionally. But the replacement shows that you see today just seem to get dumber and dumber...except Spongebob. Spongebob is my other favorite cartoon. But Rocko came first, and he deserves at least a DVD collection. VHS is OK, better than nothing, but with today's technology it just doesn't cut it.

Few of my friends ever watched Rocko, but one did, so it's always fun to quote the show and confuse our other friends. In case you've sadly missed out on Rocko too, read the spotlight review for a recap of the episodes.

Anyone who was a Rocko fan will always be a Rocko fan. I miss Flem Rock, Heffer, Mr. and Mrs. Bighead, Filbert, Spunky, Dr. Hutchinson and of course Rocko, just to name a few. And let's not forget Conglamo(""We Own You"")!!!

Well, I would stay and recall more fond 90s memories, but i'm going to my local Chokey Chicken resturant now...so please, if you haven't already, go ahead and get the cheap VHS versions, because at this rate it doesn't look like Nick will relase DVD versions.",1152489600,,1218,4.527272727272727
7873286,5,6304489633,"Rocko's Modern life is a very underrated series that both adults and children will love, though I think the adult audience will be more geared on this series since it has some funny adult humor.  Rocko's Modern life tells the story of Rocko the Wallaby who copes with the absurdities in modern life.  The show was aired in early 90's and was a hit but sadly Nickelodeon just like MTV now sucks.  This was a very underrated show with some very memorable characters like Rocko's best friends Hefer and Filbert.  One episode in particular got me sad which was the one were Rocko is in love.

Rocko's modern life isn't just one of the best american animated cartoon shows in the mind 90's but it also stars RENO 911's Officer Garcia!  That's right, Carlos Alazraqui who plays as Officer Garcia in Reno 911 plays the voice of Rocko!  I was suprised when I heard but if you read the credits and find those behind the scene stuff you'll find him there!

This show from my opinion is better then the crap on Nickelodeon now like the overrated Sponge Bob Square Pants.  I'm not a fanboy I just don't like that show.  I don't see what's so funny about it.  Plust the characters are kind of similar.  Patric and Heffer.  That squid guy and Ed Big head.  This show should have had a Dvd Box set just like all those other Overrated Nick shows that are on right now.  Other shows like Action League Now!, Kablam, My Brother and Me, Kenen and Kel(yeah I really liked that show..eheh)those shows are the shows that were really great back when Nickelodeon was really good but now..it just sucks..

Thank god we have Nicktoon's which shows all the classic Nick Cartoons like Rocko's Modern Life..

Rocko Rules.  It braught back childhood memories.  Like I said....Best Animated series in the Mid 90's!

Great series 5 out of 5.",1103500800,4,1809,4.541795665634675

I am thrilled of course, but most of all I am glad that the newest generation of cartoon watchers will get to see something worth watching for once.  Rocket Power?  what???  the new rugrats??  PB and J otter?  thank god for the ressurection of one of the greatest shows of all time.  I will remember Rocko's Modern Life for my whole life, and im going to be sure to tape every episode i can now that it's back on!!!!",1054166400,3,588,4.225225225225225
