The T-Bird DVD wouldn't play so I contacted the seller. Even though I had made the purchase almost 2 months ago, they happily sent me a replacement (works fine), + another bonus DVD (different one). I'm very satisfied w/ the new DVD's & service I received; would buy from again. *PS: My Dad enjoyed the DVD's",1295395200,,435,4.317073170731708
