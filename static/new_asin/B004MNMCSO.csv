8445363,5,B004MNMCSO,"I have no idea why this video hasn't got a few hundred five star reviews.  I'm an artist who's a grandma and having watched and purchased a lot of craft and mixed media videos, I must say this is absolutely up there in the best I've ever seen, if not THE best.  I've worked with fabric making wall hangings and then hand painted parts of them and added ""found"" elements like buttons and charms, so this was exceptionally inspirational for me.  But it's absolutely as valuable to anyone interested in canvas or paper or even just for watching Sherrill create her brilliant abstract designs.

She explains her techniques as she creates them and offers so many great tips.

For me, Sherrill's use of color, her brilliant sense of design and her overall presentation is as good as it gets.  What a gift!  I recommend this to any mixed media artist - actually any artist or crafts person.  I intend to watch it over and over just to get inspired each time.

(And no, I don't know Sherrill.  I wish I could buy some of her wonderful stamps but the phone number doesn't seem to be working and I haven't received a response from my e-mail.  I would love to purcahse one of her 21 stamps sets.)",1494979200,,1185,4.439814814814815
8445364,5,B004MNMCSO,"I'm a complete beginner. I have several books by Sherrill but was procrastinating about getting started. I decided to start with this DVD.

She uses Jacquard Textile (transparent), Neopaque (opaque), Lumiere (metallic) acrylic paints, and a little Dye-na-Flow. She paints with small sponges, unmounted rubber stamps, small squeeze bottles, and some found objects for texture and mark-making. She works on fabric and various kinds of paper. Several creations are covered with very clear explanations and lots of tips. The video looks professionally filmed with the camera always where it needs to be.

I loaded the DVD into a laptop and painted along with her. She speaks and works very quickly, so the ""pause"" and ""rewind"" controls got a workout.

One of the best aspects of the video for a beginner is that Sherrill supplies a limited palette of Jacquard colours that all work great with any or all of the others in that palette. For me as a beginner, this a fantastic help. One doesn't have to master colour theory and pour over dozens of paint colour charts right away. Just get out a few Jacquards, a scrap of fabric or most any kind of paper and start playing. There will be time later to develop expertise in colour and create a palette in your own style.

I loaded the DVD into a laptop and painted along with her. She speaks and works very quickly, so the ""pause"" and ""rewind"" controls got a real workout.

With Sherrill's sponge technique, a little paint goes a very long way.  Jacqard puts out ""Exciter"" packs of 10 - 2 oz. bottles. There's a pack for each type of paint with plenty for the DVD. After that I bought jars.

One small disappointment: Jacquard made a line of metallic tints designed by Sherrill and called them Sherrill's Sorbets. She uses a couple in the DVD but they appear to have been discontinued. I was able to get somewhat close using other brands of acrylic.

For me this tutorial has been a game changer. Not nearly as scared anymore. For more advanced viewers, there is lots of eye candy and a chance to see Sherrill's speed-painting in action.",1392768000,8,2078,4.705234159779614
