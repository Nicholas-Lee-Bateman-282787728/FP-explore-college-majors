8089526,2,B000BNV8QQ,"Much of this game are things like looking at pictures of people way out of focus and guessing who they are, but worse than that, many are you are given a few seconds to look at a picture....you are waiting for the a question to come up on the screen or someone to speak and all of a sudden it flips to a question page and asks you a stupid question like what color were the drapes, or how many teacups were on the table.  To me, that is not trivia.  I could have done a much better job creating this game.  Buy if you must, but I can almost guarantee you will be disappointed as I was.  I would have returned it, but I missed the window of opportunity for that.",1365984000,2,661,3.984848484848485
8089527,4,B000BNV8QQ,"I can't count how many times I've seen the 1980s ""Anne"" movie starring Megan Follows. I thought this trivia game might be fun to get and play with some of my friends who are fellow Anne fans. But before I played with anyone, I wanted to check out the DVD/game and see what it was like. Would the questions be too easy for someone who's seen the film dozens of times?

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety and method of the questions. There are 3 ""Games"" and each game has 5 rounds, but you can choose do to one round, two rounds, or even all 5. In each round, ten questions are shown on the TV screen in turn, and you're given a few seconds to jot down an answer (I found that sometimes the amount of time they gave was too short to both think about the answer AND write it down; you may need to make use of the pause button.) After the ten questions, you can either pause and compare your answers with other people who are playing with you, or go to the answer screen and see how you did.

There is a notepad of cute scorecards included with the DVD, so you don't even have to use your own paper! Nice!

I enjoyed how the questions were all of different natures. There were seven different types of questions, each type named after a main character. In ""Diana's Diary"" you have to identify who said a quote. In ""Marilla's Glasses"" you're presented with a blurry screenshot and must identify the characters in it. There's yet another (I forget which character it represents) where you are shown a screenshot with something blacked out, and you must identify the hidden object. It's actually quite the brain-teaser, even for devoted Anne fans. I should add that all the questions I encountered pertained to the first Anne film, not The Sequel or the... other ones.

The drawbacks: well, they're minor. One is that there is no Closed Captioning or available subtitles, and each round seems to have at least 1 question that has an audio-only quote. As I know several AOGG fans who are hard of hearing, this disappointed me, though I suppose it wouldn't be too much extra effort to pause the DVD and write the quote down for them if such a person was playing the game with me. Second drawback -- not enough time to write down your answers, really, but like I said... the pause button is there, so...

There are 150 questions in all, which seems like a lot, but once you've been through them once, playing the game might not be so fun anymore. However, after you get your fill of this DVD, why not pass it along to another Anne fan for them to enjoy?",1350950400,5,2550,4.382663847780127
