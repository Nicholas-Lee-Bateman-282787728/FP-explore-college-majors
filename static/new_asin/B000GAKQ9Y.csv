8129987,2,B000GAKQ9Y,"I bought ""Death Scream"" - and expensively, too - because I knew it was based on the Kitty Genovese murder case of 1964, and I'd just finished reading two books about the case.  Knowing too that the movie was a TV movie from the '70s, still, based on the cast alone, I imagined it would be at least worth a watch due to my interest in the case.  How wrong I was.  Not only is the quality of the photography and sound annoying from start to finish, the story is so LOOSELY based on the case and the resultant investigation (the story of the many neighborhood witnesses who, for half an hour, watched and/or heard the murder taking place on the street outside their windows and did little to nothing to intervene, gets such short shrift that it seems meaningless) that it's nearly unrecognizable as having anything to do with the Kitty Genovese story.  Horrible.  Do NOT waste your time or money (especially money) on this low-quality '70s TV piece of dreck.",1439683200,,955,4.52906976744186

8129990,5,B000GAKQ9Y,"This was a good movie. I first heard about this movie during an experiment in college where they talked about the case this movie was based on, (The murder of Kitty Genovese). I became interested in the case and wanted to watch this movie to get a better understanding of the case and the bystander effect. I use it for educational purposes. We talk a lot how people tend to react during extreme conditions in particular when people are in dangerous situations. I also loved Raul Julia's character in this movie. He was a great actor.",1376092800,2,534,4.572916666666667
8129991,5,B000GAKQ9Y,"I remember watching this movie on TV when I was about 7 years old. It was one of those TV movies that aired a warning for mature audiences before it returned from each commercial break. The opening sequence is intense and the plot that follows is very-well developed and carried out. The movie has an all-star cast of great actors at their finest including Raul Julia, Art Carney, Ed Asner, Lucie Arnaz, Cloris Leachman, Diahann Carroll, Nancy Walker, Tina Louise, Kate Jackson and a very young Helen Hunt. It's a great movie but from the content of the other reviews, it sounds like it really needs to be remastered.",1350777600,3,617,4.669724770642202
8129992,2,B000GAKQ9Y,The dv's cover was in good shape. The itself played really crappy.  It seemed to skip and stuff.  Played another dvd and it played great.  Will most likely steer away from this seller in the future.,1274745600,3,198,4.444444444444445
8129993,1,B000GAKQ9Y,"Was really looking forward to watching this classic. BUT- this dvd version was unwatchable. I had to turn it off after 15 minutes of ""trying"". The audio was extremely poor. Scratching sounds. Sounded like a movie projector was running in the background- or lawn mower. The image was blurry and opaque. Hardly any color. I would return it but not worth the trouble for $4.99. But would still love to see the film ( key word- ""see"" ).",1249776000,8,432,4.551282051282051
8129994,4,B000GAKQ9Y,"This movie has excellent dialogue and acting- with a slew of stars.  The quality of this video, however, is subpar to say the least.  The picture blurs in action sequences and the sound quality is poor at high levels.  You get what you pay for, I guess.  The movie itself is so good though, that I am still glad I purchased it.",1242345600,3,327,4.225806451612903
