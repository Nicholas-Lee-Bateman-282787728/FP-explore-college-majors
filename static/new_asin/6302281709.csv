7824011,5,6302281709,"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh was a cartoon series that premiered in 1988 on The Disney Channel. 13 episodes aired before the show moved to ABC in the fall of 1988. Each episode was either a full length story that covered the entire episode, or two short stories that filled the episode. Season 1 had 22 episodes, Season 2 had 10 episodes, Season 3 had 10 episodes and Season 4 had 8 episodes, totaling 50 episodes and concluding in 1991.

The series was then followed by a number of specials. In order, these were Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too in 1991, Boo To You! Winnie the Pooh in 1996, A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving in 1998, Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You in 1999 and Winnie the Pooh; A Very Merry Pooh Year in 2002.

7824012,5,6302281709,I am happy to find someone selling the video of winnie the pooh series.  My granddaughter loves Pooh and she watches the show happily.,1259107200,,134,4.583333333333333
7824013,4,6302281709,"Christopher Robin can't win. He got very little play in this TV series (although he did get some very good parts and the occasional episode focused on him), and he gets none at all in the new series ""My Friends Winnie-the-Pooh"" save in the UK. (What was Disney thinking on that one? Christopher Robin was one smart kid, in fiction and in real life. Who needs Darby and Buster, excellent as those characters are?)

So I had high hopes for this tape, which had episodes which I mostly hadn't seen. Alas, the one that features Christopher Robin, like most of the others, lacks the ""secret sauce"" that makes A.A. Milne's books and the best of the Disney films and episodes what they are: the almost mathematical rigor behind the whimsy of the plot. In most of these episodes the whimsy lacks the rigor, and it's spread on like too much of Pooh's honey on too little bread. (Many young kids might like that quality anyway, I realize, but maybe not too many onlooking adults.)

The episode in which Eeyore tries to become more like Tigger in order to be popular, however, has the ""secret sauce"", and it's hilarious and touching at the same time -- enjoyable for all ages.",1232928000,,1165,4.569377990430622
7824014,5,6302281709,"OH, BOTTLE: Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear create a treasure map and put it into a bottle. Our friends the Packrats want the map to this great treasure and keep trying to take, it which results in a lot of funny moments. Tiggr finds the map and asks Owl to read it. They all decide Christopher needs rescuing, so the set off down the creek following the bottle with the map to find Christopher Robin. In the end it is Christopher Robin that really rescues his friends feelings, by telling then he was in trouble and they supplied him with a bottle for his mom's flowers. He is so kind and caring about this friends feelings at all times.

THE OLD SWITCHEROO: Tiggr helps Roo to avoid taking a bath by switching Piglet for Roo. The two comrades rush to the nearest mud puddles and get very dirty. They try to blow very big bubble gum bubbles, which break all over the muddy pair. Which means they have to take a bath. Kana and Piglet have some funny moments too.

THE NEW EEYORE: Tiggr tries to help Eeyore become more like him. Tiggr finds he really does not like to be bounced or have anyone act like him. All of Eeyore's friends like the old Eeyore better, which he had already decided by himself, as he does so many things. Somehow no one ever gets how smart Eeyore really is.

GOOD-BYE MR. POOH: Tiggr misunderstands that Pooh is moving his old hunny jars to the dump, since they were all creaked. Tiggr thinks Pooh is moving away, so rushes away to get all their friends together to throw Pooh a going away party. Pooh does not want to hurt his friend's feelings, so he goes away for about 20 minutes. When he returns Eeyore has moved into his house and Pooh does not have the heart to ask him to leave, so he moves in with Piglet, his best friend. As in all such situations the new roommates have problems adjusting.

Only two of the stories are new to the Pooh VHS. Both Oh, Bottle and Good-bye Mr. Pooh are repeated in other sets of tapes. I promised I would write these little descriptions so people do not buy tapes that are reaped else where without knowing it.",1131926400,,2073,4.335051546391752
