7808808,5,6300279952,"Standing Tall starring Linda Evans {pre-Dynasty} was released in 1978, and is a great television film. Linda is as lovely as always, and Robert Forster, and Robert Gentry provide good support. Set in Montana in 1934 this tells the tale of a rancher trying to hold on, against a greedy land baron. Fans of Linda Evans will like this the most.",1439856000,,341,4.60655737704918
7808809,5,6300279952,I saw this on regular television years ago and been waiting for it to come out on DVD. It's a darn good movie with good actors and action.

Thanks.,1424649600,,321,3.735294117647059
7808810,2,6300279952,"I bought this used and it did not work. I don't believe the guy that sent it was trying to cheat me... and because I gave it as a gift I didn't know that it didn't work for a while. The real reason for buying this was because one of the characters in the movie now owns a cool guest/cowboy/dude ranch off US 395 about 100+/- north of Reno NEV. Spanish Springs Ranch is a GREAT place to get away from all the stuff in one's life. They have some great food and music, a beautiful ranch, cabins, horsesback rides...

I met and married the most beautiful woman there... truly magical. STILL

Should you ever travel on 395 (about 30 miles north of Susanville) stop in and say ""HI"" to Gary/Bonnie. They are on the east side of the highway. It's really worth a stop.",1261958400,,759,4.227586206896552

Summary: Set in the background of Montana in the year 1934 a young Indian half-breed is trying to run his on ranch. The movie opens with a man in a car pulling in front of the Shasta house. Luke is given an invitation to appear at a party, which is being given by the ruthless Major Roland Hartline. When the Major tries to talk Shasta into selling his ranch Shasta says no and him and his wife Jill walk out. Therefore, Luke, Jill, and Lonny go out on the ranch to bring the cattle that have been out all year in for the market. While branding there own cattle they come across one of Hartline calf. Luke the man that he is decides to take the calf back to Hartline where it belongs. Shasta goes into to Hartline territory to find out that Hartline has one of his bulls. So Luke, Jill and Lonny roundup the cattle and drive them to the market place. After Shasta gets his cattle there, he's told that he can only get 15 cents a head. When Luke starts to walkout with his cattle, the price goes up to 17 cents a head. After 6 months of hard work and labor, Luke is told by the bank manager that he has only $250.00 to last him through the winter. Therefore, Shasta and Lonny decide to go to the local tavern to get a drink of whiskey for all there blood, sweat and tears. While in the bar, they start to have words with Hartline supervisor Nate Rackley because the bartender won't serve them. The reason is that Lonny is an ****** and they get into a fistfight with Hartline men. Therefore, Shasta and Lonny decide that the only way there going to make money is to join the rodeo. After several tough events, Shasta walks away with a $50.00 prize money and a trophy. When 2 guys take of with Lonny money Luke and Lonny go looking for them and find them at the local girly house. Luke and Jill wait all night as Lonny takes care of some personal needs. When they get back to the ranch, the Sheriff is waiting to take Shasta in to jail because Nate presses charges of assault. When the case is thrown out of court because of a hung jury, Hartline takes things to the next level that could involve cattle rustling, rape and maybe even murder.

My Thoughts: I bought this movie because I was a Linda Evans fan. Linda acting was excellent in playing the role of Jill Shasta. The filming in Montana was beautiful to which help make the picture better. Even though you didn't see much of Linda Evans other then jeans I give this movie 8 weasel stars. If you like, this movie on DVD you can get it at Amazon.com",1173484800,,2713,4.286549707602339
