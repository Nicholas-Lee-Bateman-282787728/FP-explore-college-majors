6697860,5,B00O1D3C2K,"This is a wonderful movie about the true meaning of Christmas, faith, family, and love.  Very inspirational and fun - enjoyed by our entire family! Will definitely watch again each Christmas season!",1417219200,2,198,5.1875
6697861,5,B00O1D3C2K,"I was gutted that Signed, Sealed, Delivered will not continue on as a Hallmark weekly series. But now I'm rolling with the ""I'll take what I can get"" logic. Our non-traditional team of postal sleuths has been shipped off to help anchor the programming of Hallmark's recently rebranded sister channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries (formerly the Hallmark Movie Channel). For its ""second season"" Signed, Sealed, Delivered will broadcast as a string of four two-hour movies, with Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas serving as the first movie.

It's the holiday season upon us, but, in Denver, there's no rest for the oddball crew of the U.S. Postal Service's Dead Letter Office. In the past 25 days, they've answered 20,000 ""Dear Santa"" letters, and that's on top of their usual near-impossible challenge of delivering long-lost letters to their proper recipients. All tasks achieved, the Postables are set to embark on their various holiday plans when a little girl's desperate letter to God reaches them.

They say cynics are sentimentalists at heart, only they're afraid of getting hurt so they hide and mock behind that hard shell. But here's a show that could crack that shell. Signed, Sealed, Delivered is a show that is poignant and moving. It's a respite from the daily snark and sordidness and edginess of other television programming. It presents in its core cast these heroes who are kind and generous and quirky and, yes, interesting. To me, that is refreshing. Once in a while, I need a break from that clutter of self-aggrandizing characters who specialize in look-at-me antics and in the mean and nasty put-down. Especially around the holiday season.

It might interest you to know that this movie was written and produced by Martha Williamson, she who twenty years ago masterminded Touched by an Angel. It's no surprise then that Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas impacts you on an emotional level, much like Touched by an Angel did so routinely. Gratifyingly, it doesn't flinch from its theme of faith. There's no namby-pambiness here. The true meaning of Christmas is core to the plot. So thank you for that. And I say thanks not because I'm a believer - who says if I am or not? - but because there's something so very admirable when someone aspires to ride the wave of their conviction.

It's a family event whenever an episode aired, and everyone had best brought their hanky. Balancing the strong emotional heft is the gentle humor that permeates the show. Oliver's eccentric crew of Postables, with their chemistry and affectations, always draws a fond smile. This Christmas movie develops their characters even more, or at least advances their character arcs. In between working overtime to give hope to a despairing little girl, each of the Postables faces a personal dilemma. Why is Miss McInerney (Kristin Booth) not a fan of Christmas? And why does the eloquent, always nattily-dressed Oliver (Eric Mabius) cling to a bittersweet memory of a past Christmas? Oliver, by the way, is charged by a postal troubleshooter (Rob Estes) with delivering one last letter before Christmas Eve. Thru the course of the movie, he tries his best but is continuously confounded. And then there's Rita Haywith (Crystal Lowe) with the photographic memory and the constant pining for her shy colleague Norman Dorman (Geoff Gustafson). Maybe their ongoing sub-plot is advanced.

I'm a manly man, but maybe I welled up. To me, this is a perfect Christmas movie. It captures the sentiment of the season. Its yuletide themes penetrate to the heart. I love how the legend of the fourth Wise Man is integrated into the plot. And since it's Martha Williamson behind this, the Postables shouldn't have been surprised to find that, on this Christmas eve, they were part of more than one Christmas miracle.",1417219200,40,3810,5.01263823064771

I ended up watching the Hallmark Channel, it was the only channel working at the time and got hooked on this show.  I just love all of the characters and how their hearts are so giving.  Oliver is a true gentleman with his back and forth love connections with Shane.  The unbelievable love between Rita and Norman.  OMG, I just cannot get enough of how they interact.

Having finished that daunting task by Christmas Eve, two more letters are found, both written by young girls to God.

It's a great mystery series with a quirky cast of characters. If you're new to this then you want to start with the first film -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Signed-Sealed-Delivered/dp/B00ZE500TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Signed, Sealed, Delivered</a>.

At this point the creators decided they would rather follow a film format than a series. This Christmas special is the next in the list.

The series (and the made for TV movies) are produced by Martha Williamson who produced the ""Touched by an Angel"" TV series.  This movie continues the characterization of the TV series.  If you are not familiar with ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered,"" it concerns four Post Office employees in the Dead Letter Office in Denver CO.  They try to track down recipients of lost mails.  Therein lies the plot of each TV episode and made-for-TV movie.  This is the special Christmas movie and deals with the meaning of Christmas--of what it can mean to those who open themselves up to it.  Like almost all Hallmark movies (especially the made for TV) movies, there is little objectionable material (i.e., no overt violence, sex or language) unless you object to Christmas and Christian symbolism--in that case, you should give this movie a pass.  If you like family friendly or Hallmark movies, you will probably really like this movie.  Recommend.",1454630400,3,1106,4.994535519125683

Jesus' birthday was not revealed in the Scriptures... although being six months younger than John the Baptizer, he would have been born in autumn... what does that tell you, seeing that God left it out?

It's a light 'n' breezy sort of detective show; no by crimes or murder! Also, there're new guest stars
every  couple episodes; such as Carol Burnett, Valerie Harper, Valerie Bertinelli, etcetera, which make
things more interesting... in an old-school, retro, '70s kind of way! Know what I mean, Vern?

There is just one thing that I wish would happen.  I need Shane and Oliver to admit they are in love.  For those of you that have not seen the series I will give you a brief description.  Oliver, Shane, Rita and Norman work in the Dead Letter Office of the post office in Denver. Oliver will pick one letter at random
from the many they get and the team will set out to find the person it was intended for.  Most ends happily but rarely one does not.  They are the postal "" detectives"" and each has a special gift that gets things done.  Anyway, this movie is about one of the letters that was addressed to ""God"".
It was from a little girl in Wyoming who's mother had been taken to a hospital in Denver.  The woman is expecting a child but is in a coma.  The daughter wants God to make her mother well so she can see her as a shepherd in the Christmas pageant.  The four set out to help but are unsure of the outcome as the mother is very ill.  People find their faith renewed and the giving of one's self a true Christmas gift.  I hope you choose to buy this movie and enjoy it as much as I did.",1442275200,8,1231,4.079166666666667

6698402,5,B00O1D3C2K,"I watched this series on Hallmark and missed the fact that it had moved to a movie format on Hallmark Movies and Mysteries in time to watch it when it premiered.  I purchased the movie in DVD and watched it just prior to the second movie in the series being shown.

What a beautiful Christmas story is told in this movie.  It brought tears to my eyes more than once.  The story is that of finding the little girl who has written a letter to God asking that He make her mommy better for Christmas to she can see her play a shepherd in the church play. The dead letter crew get to work to find the young girl and to help make wish come true.  Along the way, we find out more about each of the individuals who make up the crew.  The primary back stories have to do with Shane McInerney (Kristin Booth) when as a child, her father deserted their family less than week before Christmas and that of Oliver O'Toole (Eric Mabius) who had a very sad Christmas when he was eight years old - until something happened to make it better for him.

I have been a fan of Eric Mabius since he was in the ""Ugly Betty"" series and am really happy to see him once again.  Marion Ross (""Happy Days"") is also in this movie and it was such a pleasure to watch her acting - she is always delightful.  I am hoping that seeing Ms. Ross means that the producers of the movie series will continue staring well known television stars in guest roles.  The series included such individuals as: Valerie Bertinelli, Valerie Harper, and Carol Burnett.

I look forward to seeing more of these movies.  The ensemble cast is one that works so well together.  The stories, while a little on the unbelievable side, stir the heart and makes one wish that they really did come true.",1433635200,2,1740,4.300613496932515

6698452,5,B00O1D3C2K,"I loved this movie beyond words!  I have followed the show since the first episode, and I love the characters and their quirky ways.  The Christmas message of redemption and God's unconditional love was so apparent throughout the storyline, balanced by lighthearted, funny moments, as well.  I have a soft spot in my heart for Oliver and his sometimes awkward ways, and loved the addition of a new (angel-like) character, Jordan, played by Greg Estes. This was not one of the normal, feel-good Christmas movies that are so abundant during the holiday season (which I still love).  This one had substance and was very open about the real meaning of Christmas...no Santas, reindeer or elves here.  Just the Biblical message of Jesus coming to this world to bring peace and to love humankind.  I told so many people about this sweet, touching and heartwarming movie--so much that they were rolling their eyes from hearing me go on and on.  I purchased the DVD and also have it on my DVR...as one never to be deleted.  It's just that good and touched my heart more than words.",1423872000,36,1072,4.725806451612903

Naturally, all four of them are quirky (just south of odd), which makes them endearing.  While trying to accomplish the Christmas wish of a little girl, they become embroiled in each other's lives, with the expected results.  For good measure, a visiting angel (Rob Estes) shows up to help them tie up all the loose ends.  The plot is purposely designed to be warm and fuzzy and it accomplishes everything it sets out to do (tug at the heart strings).  It's fun and funny, a very pleasant way to spend a winter's afternoon.  It's definitely worth multiple viewings.  (I bought it for $9.96 at Wal*mart.)",1419552000,16,797,4.65
