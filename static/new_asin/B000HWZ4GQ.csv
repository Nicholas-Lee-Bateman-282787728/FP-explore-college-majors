2643840,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"The set of the 6 seasons of The Adentures of Superman are a reminder of simpler times and a reminder of my childhood. Considering the technology of the times, the producers worked a miracle of TV viewing enjoyment.

2643841,5,B000HWZ4GQ,I was very pleased with your service.  My order arrived three days later and I have been enjoying the dvd's since.,1186185600,2,114,4.428571428571429
2643842,4,B000HWZ4GQ,"At age 53 I was glad when Warner finally had an authorized release of my childhood favorite series, The Adventures of Superman. Overall the color quality is very good to excellent in light of the prints being 50+ years old. It would have been a nice gesture to us baby boomers if Warner had taken the time to digitally repair the scratches, pops and hisses in the opening scenes and some of the stock footage used throughout the series. Season one rocks with the black and white film noir style of filming. The sets in Season 5 and 6 are rich in color,style and expense. The cars used  in the last two years would be a collectors dream now! Generally the transfer to DVD is primo. I would hope that when it comes time to re-release the authorized series in the future, Warner will spend a little money and digitally remaster the prints. Maybe if Warner searches their vaults a little closer they might find more out takes and bloopers to add as bonus material.

Overall this is a very good release, long overdue and greatly appreciated.",1168041600,69,1036,4.53475935828877
2643843,1,B000HWZ4GQ,I cannot understand why they are charging so much for all 6 seasons together when if you buy them separately they come out to $85.97 which is a savings of $58.02. I guess they figure most people won't do the math and just order all the seasons together out of convenience.,1164931200,43,272,4.352941176470588
2643844,1,B000HWZ4GQ,"Why is this price so high?

You can buy the complete 1-4 for 59, and the 5 & 6 for 25, totaling $85 for the first six season?

2643864,5,B000HWZ4GQ,George Reeves was simply the best live action Superman ever! It's a shame he was a serious actor who condemned his destiny for being cast in this role when he was really looking for other accomplished avenues and this is the role that brought him to fame. This series is great not only for his presence but the entire cast including some regular baddies and some great star cameos. A fine series right next to the legendary I Love Lucy series as one of the classic television greats.,1493856000,2,483,4.5

2643904,5,B000HWZ4GQ,I remember as a child making it my business to be in front of the television set whenever I knew the Superman show was about to come on. I never got tired of the narrator saying the same opening for this character daily. Having watched each episode definitely brought back memories I never stopped treasuring even though some relative did not share my love for Superman. I strongly recommend this product for all fans who truly desire to discover why George  Reeves will forever be associated with this character and why nobody else will ever come close.,1484352000,3,554,4.711340206185567

2643909,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"I enjoy watching the episodes in the Superman series.

2643956,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"Even so, I faithfully watched the Man Of Steel and collected his comic books. There's an episode in here about two clowns, one of whom is a thief who steals the other's extra costume and poses as him. The ""bad clown"" ends up throwing the good one off the roof, where Superman catches him and saves his life. The bad guy asks Superman how he knew which clown was which, and Superman tells him that his victim wouldn't have heaved someone off a roof. Another has a criminal getting plastic surgery to resemble Superman so that he can pose as him. The impostor even gets hold of a Superman costume. But he still doesn't sound like Superman. There's a scene where he chants to the beat of a metronome; ""I look like Superman, why don't I talk like Superman. I look like Superman, why can't I fly like Superman"". They even had an episode where somebody makes a radio-controlled model plane into what amounts to a miniature cruise missile. Clint Eastwood borrowed that gag years later for his last Dirty Harry movie ""Dead Pool"", when a killer turns RC cars into mobile bombs. My Dad shrugged dismissively. Having fought in World War II, he thought he knew all there was to know about men who thought they were superhuman. My Mom, who'd graduated high school, overheard that and mentioned that a guy named ""Neechy"" (sic) wrote about how some people were supermen. All the comedians who mentioned Superman in their routines were always mentioning him changing into his costume in a phone booth, but throughout this series he never does that. He almost always uses a storeroom on the same floor Clark Kent's office is.  Or if he makes the change on the street somewhere, he just ducks into an alleyway. It's funny, though, how many reviewers are so pretentious that they just rave about how movies and TV shows being in black & white means they're (ooooh!) ""noir"". Riiiiight. I first saw all six of these seasons in black & white because we didn't have the money until the early-'Sixties to own a color set.",1467158400,2,1997,4.609550561797753

Warner Brothers used cheap materials and after about 8 years, they will no longer play. I want to call Warner Brother and complain but good luck.

2644021,5,B000HWZ4GQ,I bought these for my husband who is a huge Superman fan and this set actually completed his whole collection of the Superman movies and T.V. Series.  He loves them.  Sure some episodes are a little grainy but my husband couldn't be happier.  I never would have found this in any store around me.,1454803200,5,296,4.444444444444445
2644058,3,B000HWZ4GQ,"Only three stars due to the packaging. The set comes in 4 cardboard cases that fold, not plastic cases with trays. They were well packaged; first each set was wrapped in plastic individually, then the four sets taped together and wrapped again in plastic securely. That said, Season 1 was easy to open, however the hub for disc 1 was broken and the disc scratched. The scratches did not cause any playing issues, but I had to tape the disc back on the hub to keep it from slipping around.
Season 2 was easy to get open as well, but the other two sets, Seasons 3/4 and 5/6 were not. Those outer covers were way too tight and even by carefully trying to get them open it pulled the outer cardboard holder apart at the glued area. I also tried opening the flap on the other side of each set, but they also were tight and sustained some damage.
I have made my own sets for dvds using the same cardboard technique for outer cases but use slim dvd cases to the hold the discs. This is the way most of the sets I buy usually come and any damaged cases are easily replaced if needed. Since the items are shipped I believe that is where the majority of the damage is caused. Especially when shipped during the winter to colder locations which makes the plastic more brittle and vulnerable.
Regarding the programs themselves I would give them 5 stars so far (I have only viewed the first two discs due to the scratches). The picture is really great considering the age of the show. It is really fun to be able to recite the ""Truth, Justice and the American Way"" motto that Superman fights for described in each opening. A far cry from what is on TV these days.",1454112000,6,1650,4.325806451612904

2644062,5,B000HWZ4GQ,I grew up with George Reeves as Superman and loved the series.  I saw this on Amazon and bought it for myself for Christmas.  I have not been disappointed.  They have done a great job of re-mastering this series as they are clear on my HD player.,1453420800,4,246,4.191489361702128
2644063,4,B000HWZ4GQ,"Wonderful old series which speaks for itself - just as I remembered as a kid! Audio quality is very good with no noticeable distortion. Close inspection of the video reveals some minor background noise, but nothing severe I've seen so far, you have to look close to see the imperfections.  Individual disk holders are laid out well,  with easy content descriptions of each disk. These disk ""cases"" and are held in cardboard sleeves by season  .
In my opinion, The series probably deserves 5 stars, great content and organization, price is very reasonable, but the manufacturer did not package the bundle in it's own box which would have made it a ""home run"" for me.- ergo 4 stars. Since these discs are held in sleeves, I was able to wrap layers of packing tape around those 4 individual sleeves, and made them into a sudo collector's box that actually looks pretty good.",1452729600,8,871,4.717105263157895
2644064,5,B000HWZ4GQ,Bought these for my wife as a Christmas present and she loves them. Pretty good quality. We still can't figure out why no one can figure out that Clark Kent and Superman are the same person just because of a pair of glasses though.,1452556800,5,231,4.2727272727272725
2644065,4,B000HWZ4GQ,"Great for old guys reliving their childhood; amazed at how much smoking there was on TV back then; be aware that there will be places that the sound is really poor; probably the masters, being so old, are very poor.

Was surprised at how many of these I remember from childhood; they do get repetitious though; suggest ordering just a couple and see if you really want the same thing over and over: Lois and/or Jimmy get in trouble; Superman gets them out.

But it's fun to see the 1950s version of gangsters, mad scientists, etc.

There are a few specials and once you view them, you will take a closer look at superman in his costume...it was padded with rubber and caused him to sweat a lot and break out in hives! LOL What we will do for fame!",1450051200,7,747,4.321428571428571

2644319,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"I watched these programs as a kid in the mid 1960s so no surprises.  I love them now as I did then and enjoy the period cars.  The early ones in B&W were good film noir.  The original Lois; Phyllis Coates, has one of the best screams television and movies has to offer.  The second Lois; Noell Neil, is a more warm character, almost matronly at times but would dog the heels of her male counterparts with equal dedication, especially the sly Clark/Superman.  Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen was a real card !  I enjoy his naive buffoonery.  In cartoons or live action, I have yet to see an editor who plays ruff & gruff like John Hamilton's Perry White.  Spiderman's Jonah Jameson is but a pale imitation.  And I would put Robert Shayne's Inspector Bill Henderson right up there with Jack Webb's Joe Friday.  If Robert and George (Reeves) were around today I could see a lot of voice over/narrator work for them.  They have a nicely resounding resonance in their voice.
-
The bonus material was worthwhile too.  Interviews with Jack and Noell were fun and informative.  A few of the programs in the series that were rerun with a voice over explaining the episode, by people I am not familiar with, had some light moments while explaining the story itself.
-
The DVDs came in good time.  They could have been packed with better ""cush"" however.  The bubble wrap was of the large pocket variety and did not completely surround the product.  The discs played well.  The very first episode disc of the entire series just fell out of the wrapper when I opened it.  One of the multiple springy tabs (1 of 3)  that hold the disc on the board was broken off.  That may have been the case even with more cushy packing.  I have bought DVDs from the store that had the same problem.
-
In summation: If you are a ""Super"" person and believe this cast as being the definitive of the entire Superman movies and tv runs then do yourself a favor and buy the set.  The color ones, starting at season 3, are a real visual treat and I would also mention that every episode that featured a nutty professor was just the greatest !

2644357,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"""Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound..."" Has there ever been a television show with a more famous opening than this? One reason why the iconic THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN continues to be so thoroughly enjoyable more than 50 years later is because of its purity of spirit. Unlike most of today's T.V. fare, it didn't concern itself with topical issues of its day which date quickly. Instead, every episode is a tight half hour of high quality entertainment handled in a straightforward manner. The simple storylines evoke a genuine comic book feel and also reflect the optimism of the '50's. While this kind of uncomplicated approach for television may not be fashionable today, it helped SUPERMAN achieve a universal appeal and longevity that soars far beyond its initial 6 year run and into the age of DVD.

Despite the various incarnations of the character that have followed him, George Reeves will always be the definitive Superman alias Clark Kent. He donned the cape and costume at a time when this actually meant something to millions of kids still innocent enough to believe in heroes. The lack of that kind of innocence has taken some of the sheen off every other Man of Steel since.

The first 2 seasons are in black and white giving the show a film noir edge similar to the B-crime thrillers of the era. The lighter-in-tone seasons 3-6 were shot in color, although it wasn't until color T.V. sets became popular in the late '60's and early '70's that their splendor could finally be seen. Thanks to the farsighted decision to film in color, a whole new generation of kids (myself included) discovered THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and didn't realize they were watching a show  almost 20 years old!

All 6 seasons are a must have DVD collection, hands down. Extras include retrospectives and interviews with Noel Neill (Lois Lane in seasons 2-6; Phyllis Coates was Lois in season 1), and Jack Larson (Jimmy Olsen), who also offer commentaries on a few of the episodes. This is high flying fun of the highest order - a true television classic.",1316563200,,2122,4.7896174863387975

2644362,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"Note: I know I already reviewed the first season but that was mainly for the feature ""Superman and the Mole Men"". This way, I can give my opinion on the series as a whole.

Another superhero classic, made in a time when television was young, there were good actors and special effects weren't all done with the computer. This series was groundbreaking in many ways, which I'll touch upon when I get to it. For those who haven't seen the series yet, a little info: none of Superman's villains (Lex Luthor, Brainiac, General Zod, Mr. Mxyzptlk, etc.) don't appear, the character instead fighting scientists, foreign agents, corrupt politicians (again, when aren't they evil) or thugs. Also, the Fortress of Solitude never appears (that didn't come around in the comics until 1958) and Kryptonite is used rarely as a weapon against Superman. First I'll talk about the actors.

George Reeves is my personal favorite Superman actor, portraying him with a sense of believability, both in and out of the costume. I already talked about this in my reviews for Superman: The Movie and the individual first season release, so I won't reiterate here. Between the two Lois', I prefer Phyllis Coates. She played the character with spunk and attitude, character traits not present in women on TV back then and traits that I really don't see in other actresses who would play the part (other than Margot Kidder). Coates' Lois, when captured, would actually put up quite a good fight and probably could've gotten out of the situation, but thanks to Superman, she doesn't sustain as many bruises. Noel Neill plays her as your typical damsel in distress, but since she stays with the show longer, she's able to develop the character more (like in the episode ""The Wedding of Superman"", where Lois' real emotions come out). She was a groundbreaking character, not only because of those traits, but because there weren't that many strong female characters at that point that had a job in a field that's pretty much dominated by men. Jimmy Olsen is a character I've never really liked, he just seems like an unnecessary character who isn't used very much in the future movies and animated series. I also don't like the way he's portrayed, sometimes coming off to me as a smug little kid (Superman Returns). What's worse is that the character was actually better in the first two seasons, portrayed as a juvenile in danger who was competent in things he tried at. Sadly, in the color years he would be reduced to painful comic relief, waiting alongside Lois for Superman to rescue them. Fortunately, Jack Larson makes him likeable and the character has his memorable moments in episodes like ""Semi-Private Eye"" and ""Jimmy Olsen, Boy Editor"". Perry White, like Olsen, is put to more use than what future media outlets would do with the character. John Hamilton is great at White, portraying him as an old-time newspaper man, taking no nonsense from anyone, especially Olsen's constant use of the term ""Chief"". He too has standout episodes like ""Perry White's Scoop"" and ""Money to Burn"". Robert Shayne's Inspector Henderson was added for the radio show but the character feels like he's been apart of the Superman mythos for years, more or less serving as a more competent version of Batman's Commissioner Gordon (until the animated series of course).

Season 1 is considered by many to be the best. Original radio producer Robert Maxwell treated it as the radio show, just done for a different media. He envisioned ""mini-movies"" (a term later used by Bruce Timm and the writers of Batman: TAS). And they are too, mini-crime dramas done in the style of film noir. Criminals lurk in the shadows and death happens both on and off screen. Also, something that doesn't happen in later media interpretations of the character; Superman engages in fisticuffs with regular humans, something that would logically kill them. Standout episodes from season 1 other than the first episode (which, like, in EVERY OTHER Superman media, is his origin story) include; ""The Haunted Lighthouse"", ""Night of Terror"", ""The Secret of Superman"" and ""The Stolen Costume"". Season two is where new producer Whitney Ellsworth and sponsor Kelloggs lightened things up a bit. The good thing was that it balance the dark aspects of the first year and lighter aspects that would be present in future seasons. Characters were more inclined to die offscreen and plots began to be more child friendly (like ""My Friend Superman"") but nonetheless there were many great episodes like ""Five Minutes to Doom"", ""The Defeat of Superman"", ""Panic in the Sky"" and ""The Golden Vulture"". My favorite episodes are season one's ""Crime Wave""; which has Superman battle an army of stock footage in order to get to Metropolis' mysterious #1 crime boss (features some great effects and twist reveal) and season two's ""The Wrecker"", in which a terrorist uses remote toy airplanes laced with explosives against Metropolis' transportation system. Plot device sound familiar? In Batman: TAS episode ""The Grey Ghost"", a terrorist uses a similar ploy of explosive toy cars.

Seasons 3 and 4 is where things got extremely kid friendly. While it was great that the episodes were done in color (a very rare thing for 1950s television but the producers were thinking of re-runs in the future when color broadcasting would become a reality). No longer did people die, Superman rarely fought and guns were always fired at him. The episodes got really repetitive with these seasons, you basic formula is as follows:
1. Minor inconvenience (thug with gimmick)
2. Lois and Jimmy get captured
3. Superman is briefly detained
4. Superman saves them at the last second
""Flight to the North"", ""The Bully of Dry Gulch"", ""Joey"" and ""Topsey Turvy"" were some of the worst episodes the series ever produced. But fortunately there were some great episodes as well. ""The Talking Clue"" and ""Blackmail"" were great features for Insp. Henderson while ""The Deadly Rock"" had a good story and featured Robert Lowery (Batman in the 1949 serial). My personal favorite episodes were season three's ""The Magic Necklace"" in which Clark's secret is almost blown and season four's ""The Big Freeze"" where two criminals freeze Superman's abilities, proving far more effective than any piece of Kryptonite.

Seasons 5 and 6 was when they tried to go back to their second season roots, George Reeves directs the final three episodes as well, making the sixth season feel special. Outside the first year, these are probably my favorite seasons as there were far few clunker episodes and the effects were better than ever (including the little balls of light that would bounce of Reeves' chest). Some great episodes include ""Peril in Paris"", ""Disappearing Lois"", ""Close Shave"", ""The Mysterious Cube"" and ""The Big Forget"". Two of my favorites include season 5's ""The Stolen Elephant"", where a boy adopts a baby pachyderm and season 6's ""The Perils of Superman"", in which a criminal who encases his identity in a lead mask, picks off the Daily Planet staff one by one. There were to be at least two more seasons but George Reeves' untimely death skewered those hopes.

The effects are great. It shows that a lot of time and effort went into creating them and they tried to make them as realistic as possible (comapred to the CG Brandon Routh of Returns). The flying shots are especially inventive, the effects team would shoot it once and then reuse and alter the effect when needed. Occasionally, new flying material was filmed, and when it did it made the episode that much better. The take offs and landings were more physical and looked more realistic than the gracefulness of the future movies/TV series, wondering why effects teams won't resort to the phsyicalcality of this series. I wish the little bullet lights were present for most of the seasons but I guess they figured the audience knew the bullets were bouncing off (I just liked the effect, I think it added to it). All in all, a great series for young or old.",1275782400,25,8000,4.926612305411416

2644365,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"A few years back, I watched these episodes of the Superman series on a black and white television.  Every week during the season a new show would air and capture the interest of many a young viewer and probably quite a few adults as well.

While it's not quite the same to see these shows now, I find that I have a smile on my face the whole time an episode is playing.  I purchased this series in April 09 and have 4 or 5 episodes left to view, I've been sort of rationing the shows to make them last longer.

The overall quality of these shows is much better that the quality of the television reception that we experienced in that era, what with the antenna on the fringe of the stations' reception area.

8141697,5,B000HWZ4GQ,"Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman! I watched this series religiously in reruns when I was a child. Years before Christopher Reeve dawned the red cape, George Reeves was the Superman I knew best. This was a well crafted, quality drama that played like a noire-ish crime procedural, with little to no camp--especially in the early episodes. Lois Lane is particularly notable. Rather than a screaming damsel in distress, she is a tough as nails investigative reporter, absolutely fearless in 1951. This box set is well packaged and full of special features, including documentaries and the 1951 theatrical movie, ""Superman and the Mole Men,"" starring George Reeves as Superman on the big screen. I've never seen that, so I'm looking forward. I'm only just beginning my binge session, but already the episodes are pure joys; the picture is crystal clear and better than ever. Of interesting note is the original pilot episode, ""Superman on Earth,"" which I had somehow never seen, despite seeing so many episodes in rerun. It is the standard Superman origin story, beginning on a doomed Krypton, following the alien child as he crashes outside Smallville and is taken in by the Kents; it explores his childhood in which young Clark is traumatized by powers he doesn't understand and doesn't want in contrast to normal children. He watches his foster father die of a heart attack. It isn't fluff by any stretch, but a very dark and dramatic episode. But of personal interest to me is the episode's first half set on Krypton, featuring Superman's real parents as they battle political and social upheaval on the eve of their horrible destruction and deaths (this episode pulls no punches). Having just recently listened to the 1940s Superman radio show on Amazon Music, I immediately recognized the dialogue of the TV pilot's first half as being an almost word for word transcript from the first episode of the radio series. They clearly reused the same script for the Krypton portion of the story, which I thought was interesting. A gem to own.",1515542400,5,2066,4.905714285714286
