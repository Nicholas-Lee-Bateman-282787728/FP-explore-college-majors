8168404,2,B000MFPYOA,"As with many such ""documentaries"", viewers should expect only lip-service to be paid to the likely rational causes for ""demonic possession"" which, in this case, is the story upon which William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist"" was based.  In fact, there isn't even much consultation of experts at all.  Rather, it is hardly more than a third-rate reenactment of the ""true story"".
Even the supposed diary account of this exorcism, which is much of the documentation for the event, has flaws that are so obvious you must wonder why they were not challenged in the show.  For example, the counting of days is mixed up; the diary supposedly stated that the devil, through the possessed boy, said, on March 31, the 16th day of the exorcism ritual, that he would give ""a sign"" (presumably of his intent to stay or leave) in 10 days.  That should therefore have occurred on April 9-10.  Yet the show reports the sign as not being given until April 11th.  Apparently the job of chronicling the exorcism was given to the priest who failed basic math.  Further, it was reported that the devil was pronounced ""gone"" two separate times -- first by the boy, at the end of the exorcism, then again later by the exorcist-priest when a loud explosion was heard after communion was taken by the boy.  So which time did the devil leave?
I am not passing judgment on the subject, but, if the event is a true story, hopefully someone somewhere has done better to make the case.",1294444800,,1453,4.6484375
