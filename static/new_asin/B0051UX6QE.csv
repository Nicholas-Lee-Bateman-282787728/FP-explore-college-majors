8453322,1,B0051UX6QE,"There were literally only 10 minutes out of 3 hours devoted exclusively to the use of photographs for painting..WHAT?  Talk about false advertising!! Also, he doesn't seem to think there are female artists and made racists remarks about a Chinese artist that he thought were so funny and clever....NOT even a little bit!!  There were long pauses without verbal instruction or explanation which I thought were the reasons to make an instructional video.  THEN, at the very end, he finishes the painting OFF CAMERA posting a photo of the newly completed painting containing SO many changes from the entire 3 hour video!!!  So how does he explain the changes?  HE DOESN'T...instead there's a 2 sentence written explanation streaming across the top of the painting photo saying that he had some time to think about the composition, colors, values, etc. so he was compelled to make the changes...REALLY?  How about thinking about those things  before you charge someone $95 for your supposed expertise or better still, actually SHOW and explain why and how you made the changes.  This was  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  I would NOT recommend this video to anyone.",1516233600,,1151,5.074468085106383
