8667812,5,B00LSCMDCM,"Absolutely incredible! The creators ""knocked it out the park"" with Star Blazers 2199. Star Blazers 2199 covers the gaps, answer questions, and eliminates wasteful episodes (Balanosaurus/Magnetron Wave) from the original series. I didn't think it was possible, but Desslok is even more ruthless than before and Lysis, long thought to be a fanatic,is portrayed in a different light. A MUST buy for all Star Blazer fans.",1468540800,4,417,5.333333333333333
8667813,4,B00LSCMDCM,"In Japanese with English subtitles.  I thought it was going to be in English and bought this for my disabled son, who cannot read.  It should be marked as subtitled.",1437609600,3,165,4.466666666666667
8667814,4,B00LSCMDCM,Great remake of the original. I just wish they had English voice over instead of subtitles so my kids could enjoy them too.,1437523200,4,123,4.391304347826087
