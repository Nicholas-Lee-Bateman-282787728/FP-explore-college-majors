8576059,5,B00C0LYFCG,"The film shows much appreciation for natural burial and cremation natural woodland or meadow locations with the initiative of a fine South Carolina doctor and wife who have given their community beauty in death, and other ceremonies in their newly restored chapel in this conservation land and special park they were able to buy. Very much needed and appreciated in this era, and it seems the movement is sweeping the country.

Dr. Campbell has done us a favor and many now want to be remembered by loved ones in a natural setting near water with a tree planted in their memory or a large natural beautiful rock carved out with their name rather than expensive metal coffin that cannot keep nature out no matter how expensive or how tight. Deep body burials without coffins result in  excellent nutrients for the soil and for future vegetation. The time has come for we humans to return to nature to celebrate in real time, our connection with the earth.",1416700800,,954,4.740963855421687
