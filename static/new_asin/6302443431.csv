7825718,5,6302443431,"This video is great, no there's not matches, not not even interviews, just profiles on all the top WCW stars or what WCW wants you to think are stars.  They have nice footage of Sting and Luger, he77 even the Steiners but then after about 4 segments they run out of steam and thats when the video goes from greatness.  As in a segment on El Gante (the worst wrestler in history) with footage strickly from the 500 seat Omni in Altana where all the other segments footage is provided from.  But hold on they even use the same jobbers on each segment, man cost cutting must be tough.  Theres one jobber who has a long red beared, is bald, scrawny, and wears pants resembling OR scrubs, who gets the crap beat out of him by everybody.  I've never laughed as hard as I did watching every ""superstar"" destroy him over and over.  Buy this video for the simple reason the old WCW Main Event show has finally came to video.",1064448000,,915,4.321637426900585
