1210206,5,B00000FCYX,I first saw this movie in Paris and I can tell you the theater was packed. Even the French liked it! And it was shown with subtitles! This is one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. And yet there is no DVD and it is NEVER shown an TV. My tape of it was loaned to a friend and he never returned it. But I can still play those great flight scenes in my mind! Comes on guys...give us a DVD!!!!,1117756800,7,400,3.8313253012048194
1210207,5,B00000FCYX,I emailed Agamemnon films asking about a DVD of Mother Lode and they said they are hoping to make a deal soon that would make it available on DVD.  Let's keep our fingers crossed!!  Now if we could only get Turner to OK the release of Treasure Island on DVD!!!,1114473600,5,260,4.18

Maybe this will finally get released on DVD.  I sure hope it doesn't wait for the death of a star to come out on DVD.  It is a wonderful movie and enjoyable to watch.  Where's the DVD?,1111795200,2,351,7.093023255813954
1210209,5,B00000FCYX,"Just thought I'd put in an updated request for the DVD.  This way someone at the studio will notice this and tell their bosses to put this out.  They are looking at these requests right??  Or, maybe they're all busy planning the next Gigli, Catwoman, or the like.  As long as I'm here, might as well add that this is a great thriller, filmed in the incredible settings of Southeast Alaska, and, it has THE MAN himself starring.  Nuff said.",1107993600,38,439,4.4375

1210211,5,B00000FCYX,"I, too, am waiting impatiently for the release of this movie on DVD. I actually recorded this movie in 1982 when it showed on HBO.  Charlton Heston's Scottish accent alone is worth seeing this movie for!!  The plot is nothing like you have seen the likes of and a few twists will keep you guessing to the very end.",1086739200,7,314,4.305084745762712
1210212,5,B00000FCYX,I must of watched this movie about 10 times in theatres when it first came out. One of my favorite movies ever! Charleton Heston is dynamic in dual roles he played in this one. Top notch wilderness scenery and photogrpahy. One of the best. A true horror/suspence/action-adventure movie! The scenes inside the Mine are awesome. Very suspence filled. I suggest anybody watch this movie if it ever is on TV again. I don't know why but this is just one movie that isn't played on television (maybe once in the early 80's) and it's a hard one to find even on VHS. My copy is getting worn and I pray that Heston and the studios involved release this on DVD soon! It was filmed in Cinamascope 2:35:1 long widescreen and hasn't been viewed in all it's widescreen glory since the days it was in the theatres. I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT IS AVAILABLE ON DVD!,1085011200,5,841,4.432258064516129
1210213,5,B00000FCYX,"I could watch this movie a thousand times and never tire of it. I'm with the previous reviewers in that this is also one of my all time favorite movies and I also can't understand why it hasn't been offered on DVD!!!!!! Ughh!! Oh well, there's still hope. This movie centers around a gold mine above the Stikine river in the Cassiar mountain range of northern British Columbia. Nick Mancuso and Kim Basinger play two friends of a MolyCo Geologist who has disappeared, they begin looking for him in this area based on various clues. On the quest for their friend they cross paths with Charlton Heston playing a grizzled old Irish prospector who still works the mine. The action, suspense, and surprises that ensue will keep you on the edge of your seat. The mountain scenery is wonderful and Kim Basinger makes the scenery equally as wonderful inside the mine. If you are an aviation fanatic like me you will also want to check out the crash landing of the floatplane to see how quickly it got away from the pilot as soon as he touched down. As mentioned by a previous reviewer the movie was rewritten slightly to accommodate the unintentional crash. I highly recommend this movie. My favorite line from the film: ""You shouldn't aughta done that laddie!""",1064448000,,1253,4.67420814479638

1210215,4,B00000FCYX,I don't think the critics cared much for this film but I remember seeing it when I was younger and thought it was pretty intense. Charlton Heston does a great job with his role. Kim Basinger also does a good job in an early role for her. The story line is tense and leaves the viewer guessing up until the end. I was also very impressed with the locations and the sets used in the film. The scenery of the British Columbia location is impressive and the scenes in the mine set a great tone. All in all I really enjoyed this film and hope to see it re-released in the future.,983750400,38,574,4.133928571428571

1210283,5,B00000FCYX,"The DVD was worth waiting for...  I've enjoyed this movie since it was originally released as I had seen it in the theater originally.  I liked it so much, as in my opinion, it was Charlton Heston's best work, that years ago I tracked down the VHS tape.  The movie was never highly publicized, so finding the movie was not easy.  While the VHS of course has the same content, the DVD is far superior in playback quality.

The flying sequences are some of the best ever filmed, and with the digital quality of the DVD, on a big screen it is fantastic !!!

Won't spoil the story, but a great adventure and mystery.  Plenty here to keep you on the edge throughout the film...  Well worth the purchase and the 5 star rating...",1490659200,,722,4.335820895522388

Before 911, there was Skyjacked

1210452,5,B00000FCYX,"When putting together a group of movies to showcase the talents of super star Charlton Heston there's a lot of ways to go about selecting films. This is a odd grouping of movie's but works well based on the accessibility of the films.  ""Skyjacked"" & "" Mother Lode"" are Heston films that are often overlooked & are getting hard to find.  ""The Omega Man"" is a Richard Matheson novella that first made it to the big screen titled ""The Last Man on Earth"" starring Vincent Price, its most recent appearance on the big screen starred Will Smith & shared the same title as the novella "" I am Legend"", all good translations of the story but "" The Omega Man"" has always been my personal favorite.  ""Soylent Green"" is a Sci-Fi that has a eerily prophetic vision of a not to distant future.  This is a nice affordable collection of some of Charlton Heston's harder to find movies.",1448323200,7,869,4.481012658227848
1210453,5,B00000FCYX,I love these four packs of DVDs. It is great value especially when the discs are the individual movies and not the cursed double sided discs. Omega Man and Soylent Green are the main reasons to buy this but I had seen both of those and actually found that Mother Lode and Skyjacked were the more interesting selections here. Both of these are little known CH movies that pack a lot of excitement and thrills.

He could have played non-gangster rolls, if they'd let him.  Chuck Heston is pretty much playing the same type of character as he did in Planet of the Apes in both movies.  Omega Man reminds me a little bit of Mad Max and may have influenced the Mel Gibson original.  It's different from Will Smith's ""I Am Legend"" that is the remake and has the same title as the book.

The other two movies might be worth watching, but I'm going to let someone else write about it.",1438905600,2,622,4.264957264957265

The others would have been pretty lousy if not for Charlton's presence.  Omega Man must be the inspiration for `I Am Legend' (Will Smith) - so many similarities.  Soylent Green with Edward G. Robinson is also a favorite.  I like SciFi that is at least remotely plausible - special effects only need to be well done for its time.

The interesting thing about these two movies is that when I sat down to watch them they were completely fresh. Of course, the implications in both movies COULD still really happen! SOYLENT GREEN  takes place in 2022 and this is 2014 . . . We DO have some of the conditions on our Planet Earth that are displayed in the stories in the feature films. Charleton Heston was magnificent in both films - both Moses and Ben Hur delivering performances that warn of the sins and destruction of man . . . Outstanding!!",1405468800,2,645,4.375

1210776,3,B00000FCYX,"Heston, in part because of his biblical epics and also for his political views, has often seemed more like a monument than a living breathing actor but he did manage to star in at least four great movies. They were Touch of Evil, The Big Country, Major Dundee and Will Penny all herewith recommended.
This set of four films overs an interesting oversight of his mid career. None of the four are great movies but Omega Man and Soylent Green have many pleasures.",1398556800,2,460,4.554216867469879

1210835,5,B00000FCYX,"This movie CREEPED me out as a kid; so, I wanted to share the fright with my son and some of his buddies. I really enjoyed it, but I'm afraid it was a bit anticlimactic for the kids. If you can imagine showing the youth of today an old episode of the Twilight Zone; then, you'll see what I'm getting at. If you know who Charlton Heston is, and are looking for a nostalgic, psychological thriller - RENT OR BUY THIS NOW!!! Just don't expect it to scare any teenagers.",1389398400,,466,4.188888888888889

1210838,4,B00000FCYX,"I remember first seeing this movie on cable tv while on vacation with my parents and sisters in Florida, and it stuck with me all these years, but could never find it, until I came across an old VHS copy in a very remote locale in Alaska!  Unfortunately, the tape was in very poor condition.  So, when out of curiosity, I searched for it on Amazon movies and actually found it, I just had to watch it.
As far as a serious piece of film art, it is certainly not, but it has a singular mood to it that makes it worthwhile and compelling to watch.  One should not have unreasonable expectations beyond this, and should just enjoy 'the yarn' quality, and, especially, the scenery... Kim Basinger is definitely very hard on the eyes, as well!
A unique movie worthy of a rainy night next to the fireplace with some single malt.",1387843200,2,821,4.3881578947368425

1210840,5,B00000FCYX,"Mother lode is the movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If its not the flying, it could be the crash on the lake or maybe the meeting with the Scotsman. This movie will make your blood run cold and fill you with suspense from the first frame to the credits at the end. Charlton Heston does a great job in this movie. I believe that a really good actor or actress can make you either love them or hate that person. Charlton Heston was able to achieve this. If your looking for something different, then this is the movie for you. You will have to see it again and again because there is so much going on. So  get your heart pumping, get a copy today. You won't be the least bit sorry.",1385164800,,697,4.050724637681159
1210841,5,B00000FCYX,This is an old movie that has a number of great stars in the cast and did not get a lot of play when it was released.  One notable scene is of a plane crashing in a mountain lake in British Columbia which looked awfully real on film and this was waaayyy before the days of CGI...and for good reason.  Rumor has it the plan actually crashed on landing and they had the good fortune of having the cameras rolling as it was happening.  Worth seeing for that scene alone.,1384905600,,467,4.166666666666667
1210842,5,B00000FCYX,"I really enjoy having four of his classics in a group package, and they are on seperate disc which is really nice.",1384300800,,114,4.2272727272727275
1210843,4,B00000FCYX,"Charlton Heston was on the verge of being 60, when he made this film. Fortunately, he had a good deal of time left to work until illness put an end to his career and then his life. While in his personal life he followed his  own star in the political world, in his acting he always gave the best that he could to meet the requirements of the  script. In this one, he was Director as well as Star, although there were a couple of other names up there with his own. He is good and makes a somewhat flaky script (by his son) into a quite watchable film. The female lead has nothing much to do except look good and be the subordinate ""girl-friend"" to the lost pilot, she and his best friend are searching for. In a thankless role, she meets the requirements. Nick Mancuso, who nominally is the male lead, has a part which is slated for a traditional mix of behaviors which can lose an audience easily. He is OK in it, but lacks the charisma to be a stand-out. Heston walks away with the honors. With rich brogue, he is the wizened old miner still looking for the Mother Lode after thirty years on the site. Your reaction to his role will pretty
much determine your reaction to the film. While uncomfortable with a number of aspects of the film, Heston's performance made it a film I am happy not to have missed. I see by Wiki that those of us who watched it are a small and hardy band, those who watched and liked it are a still smaller group. None the less, I commend it to you as worth taking the chance if only to watch one of the really Big Actors of the recent past.",1383955200,,1567,4.1683168316831685

I remembered seeing it as a kid and saw it at walmart of all places packaged in a double pack with jeremiah johnson and bought it on the spot for 5 bucks!  Johnson of course is a real classic and the only really excellent thing redford ever did.,1378944000,,340,4.2
1210918,3,B00000FCYX,"You get 4 Charlton Heston films on 4 discs in this collection (The Omega Man, Soylent Green, Mother Lode and Skyjacked). My personal favorite is The Omega Man. It was based on the excellent, ""I Am Legend"" novella by Richard Matheson. Soylent Green is an interesting part of Heston's sci-fi trilogy (also see Planet of the Apes which isn't included). Mother Lode and Skyjacked seem to be throw-ins. The price is right to add these films to your collection if you haven't already. My only complaint is that the bonus features are light in this 4 Film Favorites set. These are 4 star films in a 3 star package. A deluxe Blu-ray with 6 hours of bonus content on Heston and his films would be excellent.",1378857600,3,698,4.5476190476190474

1210920,5,B00000FCYX,"I was SO disappointed in Mother lode.  It could have been a wonderful pix, but so darned dark in places, lots of action takes place inside the mine, that one can't tell what is going on.  I RESENT this.  I had not seen this one before, and even the addition of Bassinger, etc., does not help.  This could have been great, and instead, one gets mishmash.  Heston tries to affect a Gaelic or Irish accent, and it is NOT GOOD.  One canNOT understand what he is saying.  Sound is so low  in places one has to turn WAY UP, then the digging in mine breaks your ear drums, so one is constantly turning it up and down, plus the irritation of not being able to see much in a Great Deal of the movie.  Sorry.
Skyjacked and Soylent Green both terrific, however.  Omega Man I had seen before and forgotten, but still worthwhile pix.  These last 3 are okay.  Still good price for all 4.

Charleton Heston, a grizzled miner driven mad by his 29-year quest for the ""mother lode"" of gold that has shown tantalizing ""color"" in area creeks, will do anything to protect his mine, including murder snooping mining company geologists and suspicious outsiders.

The scenes in the underground mine are realistic, and should offer much enjoyment to anyone with an interest, career, or hobby in hard rock mining.  The story is set against the backdrop of the gorgeous scenery of British Columbia, and should appeal to anyone who finds adventure in the outdoors.

Heston masterfully plays the dual personality of the cold-blooded killer and the polite, helpful eccentric.  One of his more obscure roles, but a movie well worth watching.",1359849600,,815,5.190839694656488

1211038,3,B00000FCYX,"As a huge fan of Charlton Heston I was pleased to discover finally this little known film, but I must admit that it was not a very good one. It is a honest film, with some pretty good moments, but nothing more.

The whole story happens somewhere in North Canada wilderness. A pilot named Jean Dupre (Nick Mancuso), worried by the disappearance of his friend George Patterson who was making surveys in a remote area, buys an old DHC-2 Beaver floatplane and starts to search for him. Patterson's girlfriend, Andrea (Kim Basinger) will accompany him. When looking for Patterson's plane, the couple meets first an old hunter/fisherman, Elijah who lives with his family in the wilderness - and later a hermit/miner, Silas McGee (Charlton Heston), very friendly but probably just a little teensy weensy bit crazy... Dupre actually wants to combine the search with some prospecting for gold and this will ultimately put him and Andrea in lots of trouble... I will say no more about what follows...

There are some good things in this film. The wilderness is very beautiful and all the mine crawling is very, very well done - and pretty creepy too... Charlton Heston (who also directed this film) clearly enjoyed a quite unusual role of an aging hermit dispensing wisdom with an inredibly appealing Scottish accent, calling Kim Basinger ""lass"" every two minutes or so. Kim Basinger is incredibly beautiful in this film with her long golden hair being, at least in my opinion, the real ""mother lode"" of the movie... And then, there is Elijah (John Marley) who is simply irresistible as probably the wisest and best spoken old timer I saw on the screen for a long time.

However, the scenario is not very good. Jean Dupre character is kind of a jerk, with which I couldn't identify at all. There was supposed to be some ""guilty"" chemistry between himand Andrea (who after all is his best friend girlfriend...)but I coulnd't detect any. And the ending is rather unsatisfying.

But still, I do not regret that I watched it. Charlton Heston's talent and Kim Basinger incredible beauty, combined with some claustrophobic and creepy mine exploring, are still well worth the price of purchase.",1349568000,,2177,4.875675675675676

1211041,4,B00000FCYX,"The lure of gold and the consequences of greed have been a mainstay in literature since THE CANTERBURY TALES and in feature films since the Rudolph Valentino vehicle THE CONQUERING POWER in 1921. Along the way such movies as GREED (1923),TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE (1947), LUST FOR GOLD (1949), and GOLD (1974) have dealt in a dramatic fashion with the mining of gold. One of the very best films to deal with this subject and one of the least seen is the 1982 Charlton Heston adventure drama MOTHER LODE. Shot on location in Northern British Columbia, this film contains some of the most beautiful and striking cinematography that I have ever seen. From snow covered mountains to dark, menacing woods, to the grittiest, most claustrophobic mine interiors to ever grace the screen, MOTHER LODE's visuals will remain with you long after the film is over.

The film is essentially a three character adventure drama centering on a young couple (Nick Mancuso, Kim Basinger) and their encounter with a Scottish miner (Charlton Heston) who is more like a force of nature than a man. The role of the miner was tailor made for Heston who is also the film's director which may have had something to do with it although he gives Mancuso and Basinger ample screen time to develop their characters. In fact poor Mancuso's character has his behind handed to him on more than one occasion as his various exploits usually end in disaster. Basinger, in only her second screen role, is strong and capable and gives us hints of the Kim to come. But the film is really Heston's show all the way and more for his directorial skills than for his acting which is larger than life but it fits the character. MOTHER LODE is not a great movie but if you're in the mood for an adventure flick with some surprising twists than you can't do better than this. The DVD transfer is gorgeous from the proper aspect radio to the vibrant visuals although the sound is a little soft on occasion. Highly recommended for action fans and fans of Charlton Heston although you don't have to be one to enjoy it.",1332633600,,2071,4.643051771117166

The other three films deal with science fiction and the future of mankind. I think any one will find something they admire in all the films. It's a good one to own and the cost is just right.

Charlton Heston is my favorite actor, and what he does in this superb thriller is deliver a verryyy scarrryyy performance as a secluded mountain man who lives on the edge of insanity. I think he'd have Hannibal Lector for breakfast, given the opportunity. The suspense comes in from the two unwary innocents who, through misfortune, happen to make his acquaintance and as to just how they'll survive, if at all.

1211059,5,B00000FCYX,"This 1982 thriller stars Charlton Heston as a pair of miserly Scottish twin brothers, one of whom is a violent madman. Together they jealously guard an old gold mine, and try to find its source vein, hence the film's title. The suspense is palpable, and that's the only problem... If I say any more I'll spoil the movie for you!

I've spent decades waiting for its DVD release, as one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Though I still think Heston's role as Moses in ""The Ten Commandments"" is his greatest work, I rank this film as second only to that, which says much.

""Motherlode"" is noteworthy also in that it's only the second big-screen appearance by Kim Basinger, and, I believe, her first leading-lady role. I remember watching her performance in this film, hoping Ms. Basinger would get an Oscar nomination for it. Yes, she was that good! (She eventually won an Oscar in 1997's ""L.A. Confidential"").

This film is also very personal for me. It premiered in my former home town, Kansas City. I worked for the radio station (KBEQ-FM) that sponsored the opening of ""Motherlode"". As a result, I was there in-studio, when Charlton Heston made a live guest appearance to promote the movie. Heston was incredibly gracious to everyone. As a bonus, Mr. Heston recited ""live"", from memory, Shakespeare's entire 29th Sonnet, the same performance that won him a college drama scholarship! (The poem ends, ""For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, that I would scorn to change my state with kings"".)

What a class guy Charlton Heston was! His manners and gracious way with everyone he met that day were completely genuine. He even took calls from listeners during his visit. The phone lines were jammed enough to overload, but about 20 people were put on the air to say hello to this Hollywood legend, and he treated them all warmly. Charlton Heston was actually thrilled to do this for people! How many so-called ""stars"" would do that today?

I still have an 8 X 10 of Mr. Heston and myself that he later signed. I'll miss him, and enjoy ""Motherlode"".

1211063,4,B00000FCYX,"This particular effort by Charlton Heston is certainly worth a look, at least once.  In some ways, this film shows subtle hints of being just ever so slightly ""campy"" (in the way that many early 80's films can be), particularly during some of the initial opening sequences.  However, overall, this film ""is"" entertaining, even if most of the major plot points are reasonably predictable.  There are many, many reviews describing the basic story line, so I will refrain from simply rehashing what has already been clearly explained.  In my opinion, Charlton Heston gives a tremendous performance, and is truly believed as his colorful character when watching this film, even today in current times.  Kim Basinger is obviously very ""green"" with her acting skills in this movie, as it was one of her first, and it tends to show.  For example, you will definitely not be seeing the Basinger performance which was offered in ""Cellular"" a handful of years back.  However, she does turn in an adequate performance, and you do wish her character well.  Nick Mancuso seems like he's trying just a little to hard to convince us much of the time, and it tends to come off as slightly less than genuine.  But, once again, the performance of Heston makes up for these other quirks and weaknesses of the film.  The amazing scenery, and filming techniques used, certainly add to the appeal of the movie.  This definitely was a lower budget film, with a small cast, and a relatively simple and predictable plot by today's standard, so please set your expectations accordingly.  This truly is a very watchable film, just be sure to place it in your mailbox for less than ten dollars, if you can.  One or two viewings may be enough for many people.

Now, . . . regarding this particular DVD release.  The widescreen format picture quality is very strong for a modest budget project from nearly 30 years ago.  The contrast is great, the colors are strong, and the clarity is definitely ""good"" (not spectacular).  However, the soundtrack for the film is lackluster at best.  The tones and sound effects which are more toward the ""loud"" range sound ""okay"".  But, the more intricate conversational dialogue is notably under amplified, and I often found myself ""maxing"" out the volume range (simultaneously) on both the television speakers and separate surround sound system.  Altering the sound settings didn't seem to help in any significant way.  Be prepared to keep your audio remote in hand and ready to go!!!

1211108,3,B00000FCYX,"Hi,

Watched the dvd and first for the good.  Great action scenes, great scenery, and music.

Now for the ok.  The acting was not terrible but the main character was kind of overacting.  Kim Bassinger was ok but she dosen't have a lot of range.  She was as good in this as any other movie I've seen her in.  Charlton Heston was pretty good.

Also there was not a great plot.  I was not really convinced why the main character would do all the things he would do.  Maybe he was a risk taker and lusted for gold but I feel they could of given some more development on this prior to them leaving.

Now for the bad.  I didn't care about any of the characters.  The main character was kind of a jerk.  If at all I would say that I cared for Kim Bassinger the most, but still not much.  Thrillers like Deliverence gave you characters that had some emotional weight if they lived or not.  This was standard 70's or 80's fare with people i didn't care about.

About the dvd it looked great.  It is a widescreen letterbox.

On a side note.  If you are planning to watch this as a family it has quite a few Christ's name in vain.  As well as some minor profanities.

Just mention that because I like to watch movies with my family and I wanted to let other families know about things like this.

All in all an ok movie, but not one I would watch again.

Remote Mountains, Eerie Mines, Mysterious Bagpipe Music Drifting through the Misty Woods, Rapelling into Bottomless Mine Shafts, Crashing Float Planes into Frigid Lakes, Gold!,... What more can you ask for in an adventure film? I never tire of watching this film. It is very UNIQUE! Much of the movie appears to be filmed in actual mine shafts. It is dark, eerie, and mysterious.

(Note: After watching the documentary on the new DVD it sounds like all of the mine shafts were actually sets. Wow! Those were some realistic sets!)

General Plot (Warning some spoilers!):

The film begins with a man being pulled by the ankles from rubble inside a mine shaft by another man. You think he is being rescued. Instead the rescuer lifts a pick axe and finishes the man off. We then move to Nick Mancuso's character dramatically quiting his job as a pilot for a large mining company. You find out as he visits the home of Kim Basinger's character that their friend has disappeared somewhere in the remote mountains of British Columbia and Nick thinks he knows why... he's found Gold! Nick and Kim are then off to search for their missing friend in a rickety, old float plane. After a nearly fatal crash landing on the Stikine River, they finally arrive at a remote, mountain lake that Nick believes would be the destination of their friend. Following mysterious bagpipe music into the woods they come upon a cabin hidden deep in the dark woods and encounter Charlton Heston's character. Charlton introduces them to his ""diggings"", a creepy mine shaft dug into the side of the mountain near his cabin. Nick immediately suspects that Charlton has something to do with their friend's disappearance and it's likely got something to do with Gold! The race is on to find this Gold and get out alive.

I LOVE this film! I highly recommend this film to those who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It would be particularly interesting to those interested in mining, the mountains of British Columbia, Charlton Heston, Kim Basinger, or adventure mysteries!",1294012800,5,2319,4.716049382716049

1211152,5,B00000FCYX,"I first saw this movie in the theater as a boy with my father. It's stuck with me ever since and remains on the list of my top ten favorite films. Fortunately I was able to pick up an old VHS copy several years ago.

Remote Mountains, Eerie Mines, Mysterious Bagpipe Music Drifting through the Misty Woods, Rapelling into Bottomless Mine Shafts, Crashing Float Planes into Frigid Lakes, Gold!,... What more can you ask for in an adventure film? I never tire of watching this film. It is very UNIQUE! Much of the movie is filmed in actual mine shafts. It is dark, eerie, and mysterious.

General Plot (Warning some spoilers!):

The film begins with a man being pulled by the ankles from rubble inside a mine shaft by another man. You think he is being rescued. Instead the rescuer lifts a pick axe and finishes the man off. We then move to Nick Mancuso's character dramatically quiting his job as a pilot for a large mining company. You find out as he visits the home of Kim Basinger's character that their friend has disappeared somewhere in the remote mountains of British Columbia and Nick thinks he knows why... he's found Gold! Nick and Kim are then off to search for their missing friend in a rickety, old float plane. After a nearly fatal crash landing on the Stikine River, they finally arrive at a remote, mountain lake that Nick believes would be the destination of their friend. Following mysterious bagpipe music into the woods they come upon a cabin hidden deep in the dark woods and encounter Charlton Heston's character. Charlton introduces them to his ""diggings"", a creepy mine shaft dug into the side of the mountain near his cabin. Nick immediately suspects that Charlton has something to do with their friend's disappearance and it's likely got something to do with Gold! The race is on to find this Gold and get out alive.

I LOVE this film! I highly recommend this film to those who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It would be particularly interesting to those interested in mining, the mountains of British Columbia, Charlton Heston, Kim Basinger, or adventure mysteries!",1221696000,,2107,4.732970027247957
1211153,3,B00000FCYX,"Just a quick review to say that this looks strangely like a copy of a copied VHS tape. The faces have a shiny quality to them, and the while film is not clear in any means. I hope it is released on DVD someday. I remember when I ordered this movie there was one available for way over $100. I guess that would be an original? The copy I got was $29.95. It started off with video static, then went to a Vestron Video screen, followed by the titles and the movie. I know I bought a used movie. My question is if it was a new used movie or a copy. I am giving this movie three stars because it plays. It took over three weeks to reach me and when it got here it was a little disappointing.",1208995200,2,686,3.907142857142857

1211237,5,B00000FCYX,"Got this today on VHS. Saw it when it came out years ago and should have had a copy before now. I did have a copy on VHS taped off of cable a few years back but it got drowned by water from a leak in the basement. Let me just echo the sentiments expressed by the reviews before me, please whoever reads these reviews in the entertainment industry, please release this on dvd. It is a classic and a highly underrated film.

I know that Charton Heston is best known as Moses, and rightly so, but this role should be re-evaluated and I consider it his most diverse role ever.

 The reviews that I saw years ago or read about comment about the darkness of the filmmaking, however, given the setting in a remote wilderness and a gold mine, it makes absolutely perfect sense to film it that way. I personally love any movie about the wilderness and it fits perfectly on my list of favorite movies.

The supporting cast of Nick Mancuso, Kim Basinger and John Marley as Elijah are just perfect for their roles. This movie contains all of the elements that a movie should, drama, a hint of comedy, adventure,suspense and especially atmosphere.

My advice is, if you don't want to wait for a hopefully future DVD release, buy a VHS copy and revel in the moments of a fine film until then.

P.S. For a coincidental and comic spin on this review, check out the words ""drowned, leak and echo"" in my first paragraph. For those who have seen this film, this fits perfectly :-).",1160784000,2,1462,4.396296296296296

Or, maybe they're all busy planning the next Gigli, Catwoman, or the like.

1211285,5,B00000FCYX,"I have to agree with every review I have read, this movie is probably one of Charlton Heston's best!  I don't understand why this movie is not available on DVD either.

The first time I saw this film I was in suspense all through the film and have wanted to buy it on DVD ever since I bought a DVD player years ago. I will probably buy one of the used VHS formats, because my recording on VHS is so bad at this point and I am becoming desperate to find it in any format as well as others.

I am confused as to why many of the best films of the past are not offered on DVD or even VHS, and to be totally honest, this film was not made all that long ago compared to others.  This makes no sense at all when you can buy much of the crap which is shown in theatres now.  Which mostly are made for mindless dummies.

I am looking out for various titles such as this one including ""All Mine to Give"", ""The Hounds of Notre Dame"" and many many others of which are not available but should be.  I hate to say it, but this movie will probably not be available to the general public till Mr. Heston dies, which is a shame.",1136592000,6,1111,3.9551569506726456

Charleton Heston is his normal actor-of-perfection self with Kim Bassinger, and Nick Mancuso, and the best, most beautiful scenery on the face of the earth, in our own great state of Alaska,(ok...some of Canada too!). The story keeps you on the edge of your seat to find out who the bad guy is, while Nick Mancuso is trying out his gold mining skills after unsuccessfully trying his flying skills.
