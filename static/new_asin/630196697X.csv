384549,4,630196697X,"Samuel Fuller's background as a journalist shines through in Pickup on South Street as his story begins by bringing the audience directly to the point where a man pickpockets a woman's wallet out of her purse.  Unknowingly the pickpocket, Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark), gets his hands on a microfilm containing government secrets as an undercover agent witness's the theft.  Candy, the woman whose wallet was stolen, is swayed by her ex-boyfriend to try to retrieve the microfilm from the thief  by using her connections in the underworld.  At the same time the undercover agent attempts to find the pickpocket through the city's police force, and they use the local informant to discover the identity of the thief.  Both Candy and the law use the same female informant, who supplies them with valuable information that leads them to Skip.  Fuller's direction brings Skip's destiny onto the silver screen with suspense as his direction is forcefully straight forward without ambiguous intentions.  It has been said, that what you see is what you get, and Fuller certainly knows how to put a scene together so the audience gets what he wants them to get.  This leaves the audience with a noteworthy cinematic experience.",1077148800,2,1218,5.055

I just picked the dvd up today and I am extremely excited. Criterion has done it once again. The transfer is amazing and the film looks gorgeous. I have never seen the movie look so good, and the audio mix sounds great . Well done again Criterion! This is one of Fuller's best and anyone interested in his work should definitely pick this up. I was shocked to find out this was not one of Criterion's $35 dvds. To me, the extras alone are worth the $25.99. We get a 10min doc about the opening of the film in which Fuller himself explains the technical achievements and meanings he was trying to convey. We also get a 20min doc with Sam talking about the film, the studio, his fascination with his characters, and even J. Edgar Hoover.  If you have never heard Sam speak, you are in for a real treat because he is at the top of his game here. I have Tigrero and The Typewriter, The Camera, and the Rifle and I feel these two new gems are a perfect fit into the limited collection of footage we have with Sam. Also Criterion throws in trailers for ""Fixed Bayonets"", ""Pickup on South Street"", ""House of Bamboo"", ""China Gate"", ""Forty Guns"", ""Hell and High Water"", ""Hell and High Water"" (teaser), ""Shock Corridor"", and ""The Naked Kiss"". This is one of Criterion's and Fuller's best. You should pick it up today. If you are interested in the plot read below or check out imdb.",1076976000,3,1593,4.4
384551,5,630196697X,"Better than most film noir entries, Samuel Fuller's PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET explores the life of a pickpocket who gets in over his head.  Skip McCoy picks a pocket on the subway, and gets classified government documents for his troubles.
The police convince a woman to help them find Skip and the microfilm, and heavy drama ensues.  Thelma Ritter is especially good as the informant.  Today her acting would be considered over-the-top and unconvincing, but for the time, it was a standout performance.  Widmark is excellent as the pickpocket, with his portrayal only rivalled by his work in KISS OF DEATH (also a must-see film noir).
As a landmark film for Widmark and Ritter, as well as for director Samuel Fuller, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is a must-see for fans of 1940s cinema and film noir.

384552,5,630196697X,"A rough and brutal melodrama set against the backdrop of New York's seedy underworld which delves into the secret workings of federal agents and Communist spies.  Widmark plays the petty crook, the proverbial three-time loser, whose actions are motivated solely by greed.  When he lifts a wallet from the purse of Jean Peters, he gets himself into deeper trouble than he could ever imagine...A truly provocative film, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET was originally a simple story about drug pushers.  Originally cast in the Peters role was Betty Grable(!).  Shelley Winters was also considered (a much better choice).  This film is quite complex with some intricate depth: miles beyond a mere anti-Communism film - this was filmed during the infamous McCarthy era - it unfortunately is viewed as such by many.  Thelma Ritter steals the show as the seedy but much-loved Moe.  The viewer is captivated by her natural acting technique: when she dies by Kiley's wicked hand while listening to the phonograph, the viewer is spellbound.  Ritter won an Oscar nomination for her outstanding work.",1036972800,12,1079,5.1257142857142854
384553,5,630196697X,"I saw this film long ago on television in my country, under the title of ""El rata"" (The rat) and, again, a couple of years ago in Paris under the absurd title of ""Le port de la drogue"" (The port of drugs). Now I have the video and see it every now and then. It is a very well elaborated movie typical of the pre-cold war times in the USA: the anti-communist paranoia, etcetera, along with a love story and, indeed, detectives, though guys and other fantasticaly well combined elements. The work of the Director is great, as well as the perfomances by Widmark and Jean Peters, extremely beautiful. Also, Thelma Ritter was awarded with an Oscar for the second feminine role. This is a must-see by all means and apart from the merits mentioned above, I recomend the superb music and, very particularly, the dialogue between Candy and Lightning Louie at the Chinese restaurant, unforgetable. Buyers will enjoy it very much.",990576000,11,919,4.679012345679013
384554,4,630196697X,"The face of film noir wouldn't have been the same without the distinctive face of Richard Widmark who exploded into the genre with his memorably over-the-top performance as baddie Tommy Udo in 1947's Kiss of Death.  For my money, however, it's the underrated Victor Mature who really carries that film, although Widmark gets all the flashy scenes (his pushing of a wheelchair-bound Mildred Dunnock down the stairs is widely considered one of the cruelest in film history).
In Jules Dassin's Night and the City (1950) and Pickup on South Street, however, Widmark truly comes into his own with two of the finest film noir performances of all time.  The stage trained actor had added some substance to the flash.  You find yourself sympathizing with the callous Skip McCoy (Pickup on South Street) and nervous Harry Fabian (Night and the City) despite their bad qualities. There's an underlying vulnerability behind all the tough talk and rough gestures (the fact that Widmark looked so undernourished in the '50s may have also had something to do with it).
With the uncompromising Sam Fuller (Shock Corridor) at the helm and Thelma Ritter (All About Eve, Rear Window) in a scene-stealing supporting role, you can't go wrong.  An essential release for the film noir afficionado.",983923200,24,1275,5.057142857142857
384555,5,630196697X,"This little known gem is a knockout sleeper. Tough, brutal, and effective noir. Fuller pulps it up as he tells us the story of a down on his luck pickpocket who hits it big when he steals a topsecret microfilm that's  worth a look to the commies. But the film's plot isn't its strong point.  The quiet scenes between Jean Peters and Richard Widmark are unbearably  sexy. The scene where he knocks her out and then wakes her up by spilling  cold beer on her is one of the defining moments in noir history. Thelma  Ritter delivers a devastating performance as the tough Moe, a weary  kindhearted informer who `has to make a living somehow', a heartbreaking  performance. Also the last scenes where Widmark beats the hell out of  Peters's weasely commie boyfriend is just about as violent as you could get  back then. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",963187200,6,858,4.483870967741935
384556,5,630196697X,"Shot in just ten days on the mean streets of NYC, this Samuel Fuller film epitomizes the essence of noir.  Grifters, detectives, and spies emerge as stark characters interwoven in a plot tainted with desperation, betrayal,  and loneliness.  Pick Up On South Street is the canvass that reveals urban  realism painted in its most blackest and whitest.  Every aspect of the  film-from the gritty on site location shooting to the effective use of  close up facial shots warrants uncompromising attention.  Manhattan's  apartments, streets, subways, and harbor are masterfully landscaped into a  montage of darkened shadows highlighted by light grays and luminious  whites. Richard  Widmark has never been better as Skip McCoy the two-bit  pickpocket whose multi-layered persona slowly unravels within this seventy  minute thriller. Jean Peters is equally convincing as the street tough who  conceals her vunerability with a tight dress and a loose mouth.  Thelma  Ritter steals every scene she appears in as the aging grifter who has the  dope on every hood worthy of a police record.  At the time of the film's  release (1953) American loyalty and patriotism in society was being tested  by the fervor caused by McCarthyism. A shift from the threat of gangsterism  to Communism had engulfed the American psyche.  The FBI had proclaimed that  the most notorious gangsters from John Dillinger to Al Capone no longer  roamed the country.  Instead an even more menacing evil was threatening the  sanctity and integrity of American morality and only a vigiliant public- be  it cops or crimminals could combat this covert force. In the wake of the  McCarthy hysteria, a pickpocket was frowned upon,a Red was condemned to  purgatory.  No film captured the triangle of forces- crime, Communism, and  American justice as deftly as Pick Up On South Street.  For all fans of  noir classics, this is one to own and enjoy.",958348800,9,1906,5.120915032679738

People ride a subway car. Men wear hats. The car is crowded. A pickpocket steals a wallet from a womans purse. This woman is watched by two men. She learns about her missing wallet! One of those men visit the local police to look at pictures of pickpockets. Can Candy find this man? [They did not have an Identi-Kit then to build a portrait.] The police seek help from an expert on cannons. She sells neckties as well as names. Hes holed up somewhere. Mo knows where.

No. He now has a tail, but drops it, then goes to use a microfilm reader. [Product placement?] Candy gets the name of Mo and visits her for information on where McCoy lives.

Candy visits that fishing shack alone. McCoy is not surprised, he names his price. She leaves (she  is being watched). Candy gets $500 to recover the stolen negatives from McCoy. What is it worth to you? They exchange information. Skip wants 25 grand. She reports back. Get that film! Joey gets the job. McCoy is warned about this by Mo. She is offered a lot of money for McCoys address. [Was it too much?] Will she take the offer? Does she talk too much? I tried. The police look for suspects. What will happen to Mo Williams now? Candy visits McCoy to tell what happened. She retrieves the negatives and goes to the police. They want her to pass it back to Joey.

There are visitors. Skip follows Joey and lifts his pistol. Then he follows him. The exchange of the film is made in a restroom. Skip intercepts the delivery and catches the spies. Will Skip turn his life around with Candy? Wanna bet?

This story isn't great, but is worth watching for the characters and its background settings of early 1950s. Some parts of the story seem implausible. South Street is in the lower east-side of Manhattan, the waterfront district. Those other addresses are in mid-Manhattan. Was there some significance in this? Since WW I documents were copied quickly and accurately by photography, not re-typed.

I have always found him so attractive and unforgettable. He really is a character actor of the finest caliber. In this film he is a pickpocket who steals a wallet on a crowded bus from the sexy, sultry Jean Peters charector and the fireworks ensue as she tries to retrieve the wallet which contains government information not known to Richard's character at first. The story develops from there. It's the underbelly of society at it's most riveting. The action is fast paced and exciting. There is a touching love story,too.

384644,5,630196697X,"Richard Widmark has got one of those faces where I bet you when he was born, his ma took one look at him and grabbed her purse tight. 1953's Pickup on South Street is one of the all-time great classics in noir cinema. In it, Widmark plays three time loser Skip McCoy, not long out of stir but already back to his old vices. Pickup on South Street opens with a terrific sequence in a cramped New York subway car as Skip inches his way ever closer to his mark, some sultry, low class dame (Jean Peters) we'd come to know as Candy. See Skip reach into her purse on the sly and come away with the film's McGuffin, some top secret microfilm desperately sought after by Communist spies and by the Feds.

Just you try to find someone to root for in this movie. Each character comes off unsavory, yeah, even the lawmen. Pickup on South Street isn't a public service announcement warning us about the Red Menace. Director Samuel Fuller merely availed himself of whatever hot topic was making the rounds at the time, and, oboy, in 1953, nothing was more hot button than Communism. Never mind that the average American movie goer had only a foggy notion about Communism - only that he's supposed to frown on it. Anyway, Fuller doesn't bother sharply etching out the lurking Communist. What he required were clear-cut villains for his mean little picture. If it had been in the 1940s, it's Nazi agents he would've put in. What fascinates, of course, is that the red spies aren't the only dodgy characters. Fuller populates the screen with all sorts of iffy marginal people. The sleaze and tawdriness were so prevalent the movie felt like a sticky Penthouse magazine someone had left in the public restroom. And given that this was in the 1950's, there was a surprisingly steamy scene in the waterfront shack between Widmark and Peters. Whoooh, I had to fan myself, son.

Brother, did the Production Code suits have a field day with this one, citing its ""excessive brutality and sadistic beatings, of both men and women."" Word is that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover trashed the movie to Fuller's face, objecting to Widmark's character's unpatriotism and the scene in which a G-Man bribes a stool pigeon.

If you don't like any of the characters, it means that the cast done did their job. Widmark is so very good at playing the venomous petty crook what thinks he's netted the big score. To me, the two big surprisers are Thelma Ritter and Jean Peters, both of whom I'm used to seeing in less skeevy roles. Thelma Ritter got herself a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her part of Moe Williams, the pragmatic professional informer. I hadn't seen a lot of movies with Jean Peters in it, but I'd seen enough that I was an eyebrow-raised fool throughout the watching of this one. I guess I had this image of Jean Peters always in these good girl roles. She was a revelation in this one, a siren talking tough and cracking wise and sashaying with abandon. Jean Peters is who springs to my mind any time someone mentions Pickup on South Street. And, also, that Communism is vaguely horrible.",1408579200,4,3077,4.611313868613139

384732,5,630196697X,"I first saw this movie on tv sometime in the 1970's. I'd previously seen several Sam Fuller films, MERRILL'S MAURADERS in the theater; STEEL HELMET, FIXED BAYONETS, BARON OF ARIZONA and 40 GUNS on tv. I liked them all, very much. So when the magazines FILM COMMENT and SIGHT AND SOUND began running articles on ""Film Noir"" at this time I started scanning the TV GUIDE for such films, catching D.O.A., THE BIG COMBO, and, of course, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET.

Now maybe my hopes were too high based on my viewing of past Sam Fuller films but, hyped up as I was, I found this film to be somewhat average, better than most, but nothing really great. I thought the ""commie"" stuff rather dated. I thought this a lesser Fuller film and filed it away in the backlog of my memory.

Flash forward into the 2000's. Film Noir has gained a reputation and lots of attention. It has a big following and many films of the ""genre?"" are seeing pristine dvd releases. I've been buying them up and enjoying them, bathing in the fatalism that reflects my own life...and yet, always putting off the CRITERION dvd of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET. After all, I've seen it before and know it's some dated commie movie of no great shakes.
Then the local BORDERS announced that it was closing it's doors and I went in and couldn't leave PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET on the shelf at 60% off. So I bought it, took it home and let it sit in a stack for months. Then I got the Film Noir urge, and what the heck, popped it into the dvd player...

WOW!!!
It was like I had never seen this film before! The image was so crystal clear with such great depth range! Better than it probably appeared in theaters. I sat rivited. I was mesmerized. This was indeed Sam Fuller's greatest film. Widmark was in top form, matching NIGHT AND THE CITY. Thelma Ritter should have won an Oscar. The film should have won several Oscars. Everything was flawless; direction, acting, cinematography, music score.
What happened?
Was this the same film that I saw on tv 40 years ago?
Back then I saw something a little above average.
Today I saw a visionary work of art.
Maybe I've changed, but most of what I liked or disliked 40 years ago pretty much holds true today, and yet...
Maybe it's CRITERION's flawless print of this film that has me seeing this film really for the first time ever, seeing it as it was meant to be seen and experienced.
...all in all, this is the perfect example of a truly talented director taking pulp fiction material and turning it into a work of art.

All I can say in conclusion is that this CRITERION dvd presentation looks better than the day the film was released. If you've seen this noir classic in the distant past then you've never really seen it at all. Buy this dvd and experience PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET again, for the first time ever...

Thelma Ritter (was there ever a time in her life when she didn't look 65?) gives one of her finest performances.  And a word about the fight scene between Widmark and Richard Kiley:  Among the best ever filmed.  It's up there with the hand-to-hand between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in ""From Russia with Love"" and the three-way fisticuffs involving Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Barton MacLane in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".

I must say, though, that I didn't buy the Widmark-Peters relationship. The kissing scenes were awkward, his massaging of her face weird and rather disturbing, and she falls in love with him literally from one second to the next.

384735,3,630196697X,"I have previously in this space seemingly beaten to death the idea that not all crime noirs are created equal. Here I am again giving a thumbs down to this one based on that elusive standard. And here`s why. While most of crime noirs , those that have good or bad femme fatales to muddy up the waters or not, have crime, the solving of crime, and the message that crime does not pay built into their plot lines. The film under review here, Pick Up On South Street, however tries to combine crime with a political message, a 1950s Cold War ""red scare"" political message-don't mess with the reds or you'll be dead. Courtesy of one J. Edgar Hoover, and about a million other unnamed, unmourned anti-communists. Moreover, given the year of the film, 1953, it seems to have been specially created to kick dirt on the names of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who were being executed for their efforts on behalf of the Soviet Union. But argument over that possible link is for another time.

Here's the plot line to give you an idea of how the two themes mesh (or don't mesh) in this film. A woman, Candy (played by Jean Peters), while riding a New York subway has her wallet pick-pocketed by one low-life grafter, Skip (played by Richard Widmark). Not big deal in New York City, except that the wallet contained, unknown to Ms. Candy, secret microfilmed documents headed overseas (to Uncle Joe, okay ) through (nefarious, of course) agents working here. Skip is not privy to what he has unleashed until Candy is ordered by one of the agents, someone who has ""befriended"" her, Joey (played by Richard Kiley), to get the damn thing back. Hence she finally winds up on South Street where in a run-down fishing shack Widmark hangs his hat. Through guile, sexual advance, and anything else she can think of she tries to get the microfilm taking more than her fair share of beatings in the process. No dice, for a while. Of course to tie the red scare theme together agents, and you know what agents, are on the case looking out for the national interest. So the ""win"" is in the bag. Overall pretty thin gruel, right?

Right, except for Richard Widmark's self-dramatizing flare as Skip, and his duplicity. See once Skip does become privy to what he has he is ready to sell to the highest bidder, and it takes hell and high water, including some cooing by Ms. Peters to get him on the right side of the angels. And this is where the whole thing falls down a little. No self-respecting criminal (or certified lumpenproletarian to use Marx's term) is really going to go through hoops out of some patriotic fervor when he has gold right in front of him. Widmark and the cooing been-around-the-block Ms. Peters going off the deep-end for some patriotic reasons just stretches the imagination a little too far. But then you have to reach back to the old stand-by rationale of crime noir-crime, crime crime, or political crime, doesn't pay to learn the lesson put forth here. Got it.",1322524800,,2959,4.591682419659735

384779,4,630196697X,"The Criterion Collection presents ""PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET"" (1953) (80 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Extravagant claims are made for this noirish spy film and for its director, Sam Fuller --- It has its moments of technical brilliance in lighting and camera placement and two superb performances (by Richard Widmark as Skip, a professional pickpocket just released from his third prison term, and Thelma Ritter as Moe, who sells information and ties) --- The plot centers on microfilm being followed by FBI agents en route to a Soviet agent when a pickpocket takes the billfold it is in out of the courier's purse on a subway.

Two of my favorite actors Widmark and Ritter, hit the bullseye in another great film about the life and times of people trying to make it in this crazy world of ours.

384780,5,630196697X,"This is a review of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET (1953) directed by Samuel Fuller. Richard Widmark stars in this slice of noir life as pick pocket Skip McCoy, well known to just about everyone who counts on the police force or of underworld society.
One day McCoy is doing business on the El and he cleans a purse that contains some super sensitive micro film containing US Military secrets. And he is spotted with his hand in the cookie jar.

The rest of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET leads us through various underworld habitues as Skip tries to dodge both the well known authorities as well as the somewhat amatuerish but lethal red security force .  When a colorful street seller is brutally murdered by red agents McCoy finally chooses sides.

PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is a Samuel Fuller classic, with just enough action, suspense and mystery to keep most viewers interested throughout the film.
PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is rife with fine performances, especially by Richard Widmark, Thelma Ritter , Richard Kiley and Jean Peters and enthusiastically directed  by Samuel Fuller.

I rate PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET an enthusiastic Five Stars.",1286496000,4,1125,4.869109947643979
384781,4,630196697X,"Night-for-night shooting and low-key lighting infuse Sam Fuller's 1953 production with a stark, noir ambiance.  Adding to the paranoia of this tough romance is the authentic atmosphere of 1950's ""red menace"" fears that were rampant (some controversial scholars now say the fear was grounded in a reality).

Richard Widmark is a master pick pocket.  On a crowded New York subway, he dips his fingers into Jean Peter's purse and unknowingly lifts some communist microfilm that he later tries to leverage for 25 Gs. Dirty commie rats and determined cops swirl around a desperate couple's entanglement.

 Sam Fuller was a seasoned reporter with street smarts.  His no nonsense films are tightly written and artfully composed.  The compelling characters are usually in emotional turmoil with the threat of unexpected violence -- and death -- always lurking.  Widmark's wonderfully cynical face and voice and beautiful Peter's hard-boiled but vulnerable character are just right.  Thelma Ritter steals her scenes as doomed street snitch (she was nominated for an Oscar).  A cool Criterion extra is Richard Schickel's video interview with colorful director Fuller.",1283817600,2,1157,5.449438202247191
384782,3,630196697X,"Pickup on South Street (Samuel Fuller, 1953)

Samuel Fuller, who died in 1997, was mostly considered a B-movie hack director during his lifetime. Since passing away, he has undergone something of a revival, and a large whack of critics (most of whom, one thinks, should know better) are holding Fuller's movies up as neglected gems. The two that have gotten the most press in this regard are 1963's desperately silly Shock Corridor (which I reviewed back in 2008) and 1953's Pickup on South Street. While the latter is a far better movie than the former, it is still a B movie, shot through with implausibilities and plot holes. It doesn't stand up to such noir highlights as Sunset Blvd., Double Indemnity, or Ace in the Hole.

Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) is a pickpocket, a three-time loser who Detective Winoki (Milburn Stone) is desperate to put away for life. He's only been out of the joint a week when he picks the purse of a lovely young thing, Candy (Jean Peters) on the subway. Her wallet contains microfilm that she believes contains the formula for a patent her boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) is delivering to a rival company. It's actually government secrets being smuggled to Russia. There are a lot of levels of deception going on in this game, which hamstrings Winoki. It seems there was love at first sight between Skip and Candy, and Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), the captain who keeps Winoki on a leash, is under pressure from some government types to get McCoy to lead them to the communists at the top of the pyramid that has Candy and Joey at its bottom.

The best thing about the movie by a country mile is Thelma Ritter, who plays a fence named Moe Williams, and who landed an Oscar nomination for it. (It was her fourth Best Supporting Actress nomination in a row, and she would garner two more, in 1960 and 1963; she never won.) Moe Williams is the character around whom the single scene in the movie turns that shows what this could have been, had Fuller been willing to stretch his wings a little (or to turn his script over to a Wilder or a Tourneur); Fuller has been going along in his pulp-fiction style for about two thirds of the movie, all plot and no characterization (including the ludicrous love-at-first-sight bit, which is the main reason I'm giving it such a low rating), and then suddenly Moe Williams and Joey are talking in Moe's apartment, and Thelma Ritter delivers a soliloquy. It's entirely out of place in the movie. And it's perfect noir; think about William Holden's opening narration in Sunset Blvd. I don't know for sure, but I'd guess it's the scene that got Ritter her Oscar nomination (that year, anyway). If Fuller had directed the entire film with that deft a touch, he might be remembered as something other than a hack by anyone other than a small cadre of critics today. The problem is, Sam Fuller really was that hack. If he wasn't, all we ever got are glimpses of what could have been, at least among the films most revered by those critics. ***",1268697600,3,3002,4.617977528089888
384783,4,630196697X,"Samuel Fuller's ""Pickup on South Street"" is an outrageously entertaining mashup of film noir conventions and the Red Scare of the early 1950s. Once again Richard Widmark plays a charismatic cad--but this time a redeemable one; he's pickpocket Skip McCoy, who grabs a package out of Candy's (Jean Peters) purse on the subway. What Skip doesn't know--and neither does Candy--is that the package contains microfilm that bears a top-secret formula the Soviets want. Joey (Richard Kiley), Candy's sinister boyfriend, has been using the unwitting Candy as a courier to steal U.S. secrets and hand them over to the Reds.

The story takes improbable but riveting twists and turns; Skip tries to pressure the Commies into a big payoff, while he and Candy, improbably but entertainingly, fall in love. Meanwhile, the evil Joey is out gunning for Skip and anyone else who gets in his way.

Fuller keeps the tension up at near-hysterical levels, and at the same time creates a fascinating, Dickensian underworld in 1950s New York. Just because someone beats you up or rats you out in that world doesn't mean he or she doesn't love you. The brilliant performances help a great deal; best of all is Thelma Ritter, in what may be her all-time best performance as Moe, a sad, worn-out snitch whose only remaining ambition is to buy herself a grave. (As for Jean Peters, who could believe that only two years later she would play the serene, virtuous Catherine Marshall in ""A Man Called Peter""?)

I had not seen this film prior to ordering it but had seen/heard many references to it in discussions of film noir. Being a great fan of Widmark, I decided to add it to my collection. I found it to be a pretty good little film---nothing special, but enjoyable. Widmark plays yet another ""low-life"" that lives by his own ""code"". Thelma Ritter is especially good as the world-weary ""snitch"" who also has her own set of rules to live by. The film was made at the height of the ""Red Scare"" period and the obsession with, ""the Commies"", is somewhat dated---even comical, at times.

Even Thelma Ritter is a professional snitch and what little humour she has is beyond black.  The acting and camera work are outstanding.  Even Jean Peters who I thought of as just a pretty face is quite incredible.  Widmark is expert at this kind of part, but Kiley even surpasses him in combining greed and cowardice.

Kiley uses girlfriend Peters as a delivery girl but the microfilm gets picked by pickpoket Widmark.  The commies are upset not getting the scientific secrets so they lean hard on Kiley who leans hard on Peters.

Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit muchfor an 80-minute mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.

The best part of the disc is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (Say that three times!).

Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.

Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.

Sure, Noir films demand hardboiled punks and bimbo's of loose morals, but how many times is poor Jean Peter's, an okay doll, get punched in the face or shot in the belly.  Come on, that's over-female-kill.  That last scene after all the mayhem is just laughable.

Okay, I know, the story in ""Detour"" didn't make any sense either.  These films are vehicles for an American mythology.  The men are tough, able to take a punch and give it back too.  Yeah, that's an urban John Wayne for you.  The women are essentially ladies of the evening in a cocktail dress with a heart of gold, not marriage material, so you can er, kiss `em or beat `em up if ya want depending on the hour.  Can't lay a hand on mother material I guess.

Richard Widmark is ludicrously cocky in his role of the pickpocket with brains.  If his old man hadn't beat him to a pulp every day after reform school, things would have been different; he's smart enough to go to Harvard, but as it is, he enjoys cracking wise in the cop house.

384942,4,630196697X,"Director Sam Fuller operating in the midst of the Cold War with a low budget comes up a tad short in his film noir crime drama ""Pickup on South Street"".  While the camera work and sordid settings in Lower Manhattan greatly add to the viewing quality of the film the interrelationship between characters were an unbelievable fairy tale.

Wise aleck pickpocket and three time loser Skip McCoy played by Richard Widmark pinches the wallet of attractive bad girl Candy played by Jean Peters on the New York subway.  Little do they both know but she's been acting as a mule for her ex-boyfriend Joey played by Richard Kiley, carrying a sensitive piece of microfilm containing a secret chemical formula.  She unwittingly was delivering it to a group of Communists.  Unknown to both characters the theft was observed by federal agents who had been shadowing Peters.

The plot essentially involves the coaxing of Widmark to relinquish control of the microfilm by both the authorities and the minions behind Peters and her red sympathizing boyfriend.

The cops use tie saleswoman and stool pigeon Moe Williams played in a terrific acting performance by the accomplished Thelma Ritter to ferret out the whereabouts of Widmark.  Widmark however realizing that he's stolen something valuable is holding out for a big score.  The feds try to wave the flag at him to get him to cooperate to no avail.  Slightly tarnished Peters falls for Widmark in an implausible sequence where she unsuccessfully tries using her charms to woo him and recover the film.

Fuller seems undecided whether to make his film an anti-Communist piece or a crime drama and winds up falling short in both areas in terms of impact.  The characters created by Fuller were for the most part universally unlikeable with too may issues to be considered protagonists.

384943,5,630196697X,"""Pickup on South Street"" was the 6th film directed by the colorful Samuel Fuller, who started his career as a tabloid journalist in New York City, followed that up writing 7 pulp novels and 7 screenplays, and fought as an infantryman in World War II before arriving in Hollywood to become a prolific director and screenwriter. Fuller adapted this screenplay himself from an unpublished story by Dwight Taylor. Career pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) lifts a wallet from a woman's purse on the subway. Unbeknownst to him, the woman, Candy (Jean Peters), was under surveillance by federal agents who were waiting for her to deliver an item to Communist agents. When Candy discovers that her wallet was stolen, she regretfully reports to her ex-boyfriend Joey that she is unable to make the delivery for him. Joey (Richard Kiley) is frantic to track down the missing wallet and the valuable microfilm that it contained, and he begs Candy to use her street connections to help him.  Her efforts lead her to Skip, but not before Police Captain Tiger (Murvyn Vye) and Federal Agent Zara (Willis B. Bouchey) have told Skip what the wallet contained and implored him to turn over the microfilm.

At this point in Richard Widmark's career, he had begun to consciously depart from the sleazy villain roles for which he is so fondly remembered by film noir fans. But he was a contract player, and he was assigned to ""Pickup on South Street"", and he's terrific in it. The film's major themes are the sadomasochistic relationship that develops between Skip and Candy and the validity -or not- of the concept of patriotism among petty criminals. Writer/director Samuel Fuller had some admiration for the skills of pickpockets and strove to recreate their mores realistically. They are referred to by the slang term ""cannon"" in the film, and Skip eschews politics to the point of mocking it. Unmoved by appeals to his patriotism, Skip asks, ""Are you waving a flag at ME?"" Widmark rises to the dual challenge of making Skip unpatriotic without offending the censors or alienating the post-war audience and of making him likable even as he vacillates between gentleness and brutality toward undeserving Candy. Thelma Ritter also gives a memorable performance as Moe, a pathetic woman who sells neckties and information to whomever will pay, saying, "" I have to go on makin' a living so I can die.""

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2004): ""Sam Fuller on Pickup on South Street"" (19 minutes) is an interview by film critic Richard Schiekel filmed in the last years of Fuller's life. Fuller discusses the power of the camera, the film's themes and characters, petty criminals, the job of the director, and recalls working with Darryl Zanuck.

384944,4,630196697X,"This review is for the 2004 Criterion DVD.

The story starts in a New York subway where a young woman named Candy gets her wallet stolen from her purse by a pickpocket named Skip McCoy (Richard Whitmark).  What Skip doesn't realize is that he ""lifts"" some valuable microfilm for a top secret formula.  Meanwhile, Candy was under surveillance by the FBI and Agent Zara (William Bouchey) witnesses the theft, but Skip gets away before Zara can catch him.  Zara goes to the local police to see if Skip can be identified and tracked down.  To speed things up, the local police Captain named Dan Tiger hires an informant named Moe Williams (Thelma Ritter) to identify the pickpocket.  Meanwhile, Candy realizes that her wallet is gone and has to find it for the sake of her former boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) who plans to sell the film to some communist sympathizers.  When Skip returns to his waterfront hangout, he finds the microfilm in the wallet.  This sets up the rest of the movie where the police, Candy and Joey all have their sights on getting the microfilm from Skip, but since he knows he has something valuable, it won't come cheap.

There are a lot of things to love about this film.  This is a great example of classic film noir artistry.  The use of light and shadows in this film works wonders.  The settings and backdrops are perfect for this movie and the characters are unique and animated.  You really need a ""Street Hood to English Dictionary"" to understand all of the jailbird euphemisms used in this film.  Thelma Ritter steals the show with her street-smart performance as fast buck artist/stool pigeon.  The movie does just about everything right except tell an original or interesting story.  There weren't any major surprises or twists - which is a shame because this movie could have been a classic for the ages.  To its credit, the film takes a strong anti-communism stand, which was obviously a relevant issue during this time in the height of the Cold War.

Twentieth Century Fox originally released this movie and it looks like Criterion picked Fox's pocket on this one.  A year after Criterion released this film Fox released their ""Noir Series"" of films.  With the current popularity of noir films I bet Fox would like to have this one back.

The DVD transfer is stunning with very sharp images and the black and white tones appear to be balanced and virtually free of any imperfections. The sound is excellent for a film this old.  There are plenty of bonuses including lots of director Samuel Fuller material including some commentary and career highlights.

384946,3,630196697X,"Sam Fuller's ""Pickup on South Street"" is quite an unusual film. It is one of the few movies I can think of where there is no hero. There is not one character for the audience to get behind. Each person in the film is a lying, double-talking crook.

 ""Pickup on South Street"" seems to want to work on two levels. On one hand it wants to be a crime picture. On the other it has a slightly political bent. It involves Communist.

 Richard Widmark play Skip McCoy, a pickpocket, who has already been arrested three times and has just gotten out of prison a week ago. He is caught by an F.B.I. agent (Willis Bouchey) stealing something from a woman's (Jean Peters) purse. What was stolen was a piece of film. The woman's name is Candy and her ex-boyfriend told her to deliver the film to his boss. When Skip is spotted both he and Candy are going to find there is much going on they don't know about.

 Skip had no clue what was in the purse and either does Candy. As the film goes on we find out Candy was being followed by police because the film contained government secrets. A patent for a chemical formula is all the information we are given. It turns out Candy's ex, Joey (Richard Kiley) works for Communist.

 At this point in the film Fuller seems to have an odd message. The movie seems to support Skip even though he is a bad guy, a thief, but at least he's not a Communist, therefor he can't be all bad. The film excuses his actions making the other characters out to be the real bad guys. Is the movie trying to convince us to root for Skip because he is the lesser of two evils?

 If it seems Skip is a good guy, he's not. Skip may refuse to give back the film to Candy and Joey, but it is not done because he is patriotic. Skip only thinks of himself. He doesn't do what he does because of his love of country, it is because of his love of money.

 The movie also has a werid romance starting between Candy and Skip. It found it odd because we can never quite trust these people to know how they really feel. Plus I didn't think a romance was needed in the story.

 But the movie does have a lot to praise. Richard Widmark is quite good in the movie. He plays a classic sleezeball, scumbag who deserves no respect, only a right to the jaw. I'm not sure if his acting is better here or in ""Night and the City"" but it has the same effect. I also liked Thelma Ritter as a tie salesman/informer who is always out to make a buck. Ritter by the way was nominated for an Oscar.

 The movie runs at a little over 80 minutes, because of this it is a fun and exciting film. There is never a dull moment. That was just Fuller's style. He wanted to get right into the action and not waste too much time with set-up.

 If some of my comments seemed off-base to you, I'd advise you to rent this film on DVD and watch one of the special features, it has Fuller in an interview discussing this film. In the interview, to my surprise, Fuller said much of what I thought while watching the movie. But what surprised me so was his attitude on the Widmark character. He seems fascinated by criminals. He doesn't think they are all that bad. At one point he describes Widmark's character as an ""artist"". I, as you can tell from my review, saw Widmark in a different light.

 But I still think people should see this movie. It is well worth the price of a rental. *** 1\2 out of *****

 Bottom-line: Fast paced, well acted crime film that has a political bent as well. Fuller strings things along nicely as there is never a dull moment in the whole film. Widmark is great to watch!",1123891200,3,3568,4.193265007320644
384947,5,630196697X,"That's what the pickpocket Skip asks the cops when they tell him ""the commies are mixed up in it."" ""It"" is finding out who's running the Red spy ring trying to get the microfilm with a ""secret process"" that Skip lifted from Candy's purse on the subway.

The best thing about Pickup on South Street is that it doesn't wave the flag at us. It leaves out the McCarthy Era anticommunist propaganda and sticks to the story. Instead of a larger-than-life FBI man, the hero is a petty criminal. We're not even sure that Skip isn't planning to sell the microfilm to the Reds for twenty-five grand. For writer-director Sam Fuller, the communist spies don't need any more demonizing than the snitch Joey's ""I just don't like them.""

But Joey and Skip and Candy don't like cops or feds any more than they like commies. An FBI agent, staking out Skip's place on the waterfront (the sign above Skip's door says he's ""BAIT""), steps out of the shadows to order the New York cops let Skip go so he can lead them to the boss of the spy ring. This government agent is just as creepy the communist mastermind, who of course smokes with an effete cigarette holder.

Richard Widmark's portrayal of Skip is right on the edge between his early psycho killer roles and the authority figures he played (Army drill instructor in Take the High Ground, Navy doctor in Panic in the Streets, nuclear sub commander in The Bedford Incident, cop in Madigan.)

The way Skip strokes Candy's face (after he's almost broken her jaw with his fist, not knowing who she was when he caught her waiting for him in his hideout in the dark) is one of the most erotic scenes in any fifties movie. (This is just after Jean Peters as Candy asks him, ""How many times you been caught with your hand where it don't belong?"")

The dialogue in a lot of film noir, especially the movies with bigger stars, is a bad imitation of Raymond Chandler, who's bad enough himself sometimes. (I can barely stand to listen to Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck ""banter"" in Double Indemnity - - Chandler co-wrote the script.) But Sam Fuller's dialogue in Pickup on South Street, while stylized, sounds like things human beings would really say.

Skip finally fights it out with a communist agent in a subway station under an Army poster that tells us to ""FIGHT!"" too (the Korean War is still going on). But in this movie, it doesn't seem like propaganda, it's just what would naturally be there at that time.

For a movie where the bad guys are communists, capitalism and American society don't come off so great. One character, who's only trying to scrape enough money together for a decent funeral for when she dies from ""movie disease,"" tells a man with a gun that her life is so hard he'd be doing her a favor if he shot her in the head.

Skip the pickpocket and Candy (who, the movie hints, has been worse things than an unwitting courier) are at the bottom of the barrel not because of any failings of their own, but because of the bad hand they got dealt. That goes against the individualist free-enterprise philosophy of most Hollywood movies.

Thomas Doherty points out in his book Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture that the blacklisters were always more interested in WHO was on the screen (writers or actors with left-wing ties) rather than WHAT was on the screen (the actual messages of the movies).

But, as usual in Hollywood, Americanism triumphs in the end. FBI intervention gets Skip a piece of paper that wipes the slate clean so he and Candy can make a fresh start (until now she's worn the same dress through the whole movie). This scene feels tacked on, but at least Fuller keeps it short.",1122336000,2,3681,4.589041095890411

At first he thinks....hmmmmmm let me cash in on this, beat up Candy, Insult some detectives, and brow beat Thelma Ritter for crossing him. Later Candy (Jean Peters) gets beat up brutally trying to protect Widmark who only twenty minutes before smacked her around pretty good himself leaving the audiience to shout at the screen: ""Have you lost your mind""? Anyway she can't help her feeling for Widmark and only after about an hour and fifty minutes does he turn human and allows feelings for her to surface after she is brutaly beat up and shot protecting him. Hospital bed repentance will do that everytime. He then avenges the death of Thelma Ritter and Candy's assalt and then in the last five minute of the film flashes that ""killer smile"", turns almost straight, and heads off into the sunset to bed down Candy in what amounts to the strangest attraction in memory between a crook and a victim.

I heard a review and thought it sounded like a great idea for a story.  A guy on a train steals a woman's purse on a subway, not knowing that she's carrying microfilm which she's supposed to deliver to a Russian spy.  Suddenly, this thief has the cops and the Russians looking for him.

It sounded like a great idea, but the story was a huge disappointment to me.  The characters were not very believable.  For example, the woman who has her purse stolen, tracks down the thief and tries to get the film back.  He punches her in the face and she falls in love with him.

To me the story was very weak, which spoiled the movie.  If you're interested in the movie for the technical stuff, you might enjoy it.  Personally, I didn't find it very entertaining or believable.",1113264000,9,902,4.373493975903615
384950,5,630196697X,"I saw that someone categorized this as a mystery, and after watching Pickup on South Street (1953) last night, and I wondered if we saw the same film.  I certainly wouldn't classify this as a mystery but a hard-boiled (just like I like my eggs) thriller/caper populated by interesting characters caught up in a situations beyond their control.  Well, as my sweet, old Gammy always said, opinions are like fecal orifices, in everyone has one (technically, fecal orifices wasn't the exact term she would use, but common decency and review guidelines prevent me from printing what she would use).  Written and directed by the legendary Hollywood curmudgeon Samuel Fuller (I feel comfortable enough calling him a legend since his passing in '97), the film stars Richard Widmark (Halls of Montezuma) and Jean Peters (Viva Zapata!), who was once married to famously nutty billionaire recluse Howard Hughes.  Also appearing is Thelma Ritter (Rear Window, Pillow Talk), Murvyn Vye (A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court), Richard Kiley (Blackboard Jungle), and Willis Bouchey (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Panic in Year Zero!).

Widmark plays Skip McCoy, a pickpocket (or cannon, as referred to in the film) and a three-time loser (meaning he was convicted and sent over three times, with a fourth conviction translating into life in prison) whose troubles began the day he picked the wrong pocket book on a crowded subway, one belonging to a comely muffin (seriously, the men kept calling her this in the film) named Candy (Peters).  Seems Candy was enlisted by her ex-boyfriend Joey (Kiley) to deliver an envelope containing top-secret information (she was unaware of the contents of the envelope), and was being trailed by federal agents, interested in busting up a ring of suspect Reds (the Red Menace was everywhere in the 50's).  Soon everyone wants Skip, including Candy (at least before she found out she was an unwitting dupe of the Reds), the bulls (that's cops to you and me), the feds, and the Reds...noticing all kinds of interest  being developed in his relatively petty theft, Skip finally gets wise to what he has, and sees visions of a score of a lifetime, treading the line between two-bit hustler and vile, traitorous slime, that is if he can only keep from getting pinched by the cops or being killed by the Communists...

Of all the `noir' films I've seen (surprisingly not as many as one may think), Pickup on South Street rates very high (it's also my first Fuller film).  The story is kept lean and mean, allowing for very little, if any, extraneous material to clutter up the proceedings.  The pacing is brisk (the film has a running time of 80 minutes), and rarely lets up.  All of the performances worked, but I especially liked Widmark, as he really brought his character to life, that of a  slick, scheming, slightly misogynistic two-bit grifter looking at all the angles, trying to stay one step ahead of the law (and the commies).  I know Skip was a criminal, and an extremely smarmy one at that, but I couldn't help liking him, as despite his seemingly noxious exterior, at his core he possessed some inherit, humanizing qualities that many of us strive for (specifically the scene where he made arrangements for Moe the stool pigeon, played by Thelma Ritter, even despite the knowledge that she was the one that fingered him, in a roundabout way, to the cops).  But then this was buffeted by his apparent willingness not to be swayed by the patriotic meanderings of the law enforcement officials, his interest lying in his own potential gains, ""So you're a Red, who cares? Your money's as good as anybody else's.""...a complicated character, for sure.  I also thought Thelma Ritter was wonderful, especially the scene where her character relates her deteriorating physical state to Candy's ex-boyfriend, as he searches for Skip.  I could feel the extremity of her state, and understand her motivations of earning enough to die properly (she was deathly afraid of dying poor and having the state bury her in potter's field, a place the state interred those unknown or indigent peoples).  The slang vernacular utilized by many of the characters in the film felt very natural, and presented me with the notion of not so much watching a movie but witnessing events as they transpired in a reality outside of my own (okay, okay, the whole microfilm/commie angle may seem a little jive, but required only a meager suspension of my disbelief as the movie was just so damn good).  One thing I really noticed about this film was the usage of minimal sets (often confined to small rooms), along with peculiar and odd angles for various shots...extreme close ups, high and away, slightly skewed...I think the unconventional nature of said shots within the tight, limited spaces really served well to add to the atmosphere of the film, and tweak the tension inherit within the story, leading up to a violent and brutal all out brawl between Skip the Pickpocket and a member of the Order of the Profusely Sweaty (seriously, if you've seen the film, you know who I'm talking about...that guy was in a perpetual state of perspiration).

The full screen (original aspect ratio 1:33.1) picture on this Criterion release looks beautiful, and the sound comes through crisp and clean (the case indicates both were restored).  Criterion editions may cost a bit more, but I've never felt I wasn't getting my money's worth, and here is no different.  Along with providing a superior print, there are literally scads of extras, including a 20-minute interview piece with writer director Sam Fuller, excerpts from Cinema Cinemas series, an illustrated biographical essay on Fuller, a complete Fuller poster filmography, theatrical trailers for 8 Fuller films, an informative 20-page booklet, and stills gallery of photos, lobby cards, and original paintings by artist Russell Christian.

According to the Inspector, they ""wasn't good and they wasn't smart.""  After the cannon grifted the dame on the train, he was hot.  The law wanted to pinch the booster on a fourth offence and send him up for good.  The muffin wanted to make happy her pinko boychik, who was just in it for the glory of Uncle Joe.  The stool pigeon wanted to make enough bingo to keep out of Potter's Field.

  Okay, enough of that silliness.  Listening to filmster Samuel Fuller on the extras on PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET makes you want to speak in slang and punch in some yellow journalism touches (Fuller started out working for a yellow rag, one of the text specials tells us.)  This is the second Fuller film I've seen and the first one I could tolerate.  The characters here - Richard Widmark's  pickpocket, Jean Peter's b-girl, Richard Kiley, Thelma Ritter, are all living on the edge of society and emotions.

  PICKUP is one of those convergence-of-the-stars movies where just about everything works at a high level.  Widmark and Ritter are brilliant and the rest of the cast is excellent.

385042,5,630196697X,"After watching Sam Fuller's 1964 classic ""The Naked Kiss,"" I cast my eyes in the direction of another of his memorable films. No, it wasn't ""Shock Corridor,"" although I plan on watching that one in the next few months. I decided to go with his 1953 picture ""Pickup on South Street"" for a number of reasons. One, Fuller cast Richard Widmark in the lead role. I'm familiar with this actor thanks to many of his later films, Irwin Allen's schlock masterpiece ""The Swarm"" among them, and I wanted to see what he could do in the earlier phases of his career. Two, I liked the idea of watching a film dealing with communism in the United States during the 1950s. With the Red Scare and McCarthyism in full bloom, I wanted to see how Fuller would fashion a film describing the government's methods for tracking down the reds. Three, and finally, an online friend who initially turned me on to Fuller had nothing but great praise for ""Pickup on South Street."" Her extensive knowledge of foreign films, coupled with as good an eye for older American films, left me feeling confident that this Fuller movie would be an entertaining experience.

""Pickup on South Street"" begins with an irresistible hook that draws the viewer into the film. A pickpocket on a train in New York City lifts the contents of an attractive woman's purse while a couple of tough looking men pay close attention to what is going on. Why are these two men so interested in what the criminal is doing? Are they citizens? Police officers? Or are they far more sinister figures? Right from the start Fuller has us asking questions that we hope will find resolution later on. Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark), the criminal committing the crime, just walked out of prison after serving a few years for picking pockets. His latest crime is about to plunge him into a situation that could well result in a much, much longer sentence. The woman he robbed, Candy (Jean Peters), is actually a messenger for a guy named Joey (Richard Kiley). She carries items that he wants transported to various individuals around town, but she pays more attention to the money he gives her than the item in question. Bad mistake. It turns out that Joey is a communist stooge and spy for the Soviet Union. Candy carried in her purse a piece of microfilm containing important American secrets, and Skip walked right into the middle of the ongoing investigation to break up the spy cell. Now he's in the middle of the feds, the police, and the communists, all of whom want that microfilm.

The guys on the train don't know the name of the pickpocket, so they go to the local police station hoping the criminal has a record. The cops bring in Moe (Thelma Ritter), a stool pigeon of some renown in the city, to help identify and track down the perpetrator. After a hilarious scene in which Moe negotiates a price for her assistance, she helps the authorities identify and track down Skip. He lives on the river in a decrepit little shack, keeps his beer cold by dunking it in the water at the end of a rope, and has no interest whatsoever in helping the authorities. Why should he? These are the same guys who sent him to the stir, and he'll go back there for some serious time if he admits he lifted Candy's purse. Appeals to McCoy on a patriotic level fail spectacularly; he's the sort of guy whose loyalty revolves around money and his few friends. Meanwhile, Joey is going ballistic. He's facing arrest by the government on one side and the decidedly unfriendly communists on the other. He sends Candy out to track down Skip and retrieve the microfilm, which backfires when the two strike up a grudging respect for one another. As Joey's desperation ratchets up, it soon becomes obvious he will resort to anything, including murder, to reclaim the microfilm.

There is no reason to spoil the conclusion except to say it isn't a surprise considering the climate of the country in the early 1950s. It's how Fuller gets us there that works wonders. Not a single character in this film is anything less than totally believable, surely a credit to the standout actors involved in the production. Widmark is a joy to watch as he smirks and wisecracks his way through an extremely dangerous situation. Kiley's sweaty mug and single-minded ruthlessness more than adequately portray a man desperately trying to avoid doom. As for Jean Peters, she plays clueless eye candy as good as any other actress around. But it's Thelma Ritter who steals every scene she's in as the indomitable Moe. She's an elderly woman nearing the end of her days who wants nothing more than to save up enough money to buy a plot in a high-class cemetery. Moe is also an extraordinarily colorful and humorous character, selling cheap ties whenever she isn't ratting to the cops. Despite her complicity with the police, no one hates her. Even Skip responds with ""Moe's gotta eat too"" after being told the woman ratted him out. Her fate marks the highpoint of ""Pickup on South Street.""

Criterion's DVD version of the film contains all the extras left off ""The Naked Kiss"" disc. Tons of Fuller film trailers, interviews with the man himself, stills and posters, and recollections from Widmark provide information about the movie. While I don't buy Fuller's thesis that criminals are as honorable as the movie portrays them--call it the ""Godfather syndrome""--the performances and the wonderfully snappy dialogue make up for this nave view of the underworld. If you feel like taking a foray into the black and white world of older cinema, ""Pickup on South Street"" is an excellent start.",1104105600,4,5582,4.722051282051282

385044,5,630196697X,"This is one of the finest low budget crime films of the fifties, one that manages to get an extraordinary number of things right.  After a dozen years of film noir and tough detective films, one would have imagined that most of the angles would have been tried and worked to exhaustion, but PICKUP ON NOON STREET managed to be amazingly fresh and original.  It is also a multi-layered film.  On one level, it is an espionage film, with federal authorities, with the help of local police in New York, on the trail of a group selling secrets to the Communists.  Interestingly, the collaborators are not treated as political individuals, but utterly unprincipled capitalists.  As Joey, Richard Kiley's character, puts it early in the film to his former girlfriend Candy, ""How many times do I have to tell you we're not criminals.  This is big business.""

The film features a first rate cast.  Except possibly for his screen debut in KISS OF DEATH, Richard Widmark was never better than he was in this film as three-time loser pickpocket Skip McCoy.  The ultimate anti-hero, McCoy's motives are complex and opaque, even at the end.  Jean Peters, later Mrs. Howard Hughes (to whom she was married from 1957 to 1971), is fetching as Candy, a shady dame with a past but with the proverbial heart of gold.  Richard Kiley is suitably slimy as Joey, the seller of secrets to the Communists.  Kiley would later (after his voice darkened) become the narrator for dozens upon dozens of National Geographic specials (such a familiar voice that they joke in JURAISSAC PARK about getting him to do the voice over for their guided tour).  Thelma Ritter, as she did so often in the forties and fifties, steals every scene she is in as the necktie-selling, police informing Moe Williams, who is saving up for her gravestone and burial plot (""If they buried me in potter's field, it would just kill me"").

The psychology of the characters comes straight from Mickey Spillane.  A notable instance is the way Candy falls for Skip McCoy.  This aspect of the film isn't merely improbable:  it is impossible.  Skip picks her pocket.  He causes her to go on a long search for him while paying off stoolies along the way.  He slugs her upon their next meeting when he finds her going through his things, robs her purse while she is unconscious, and then pours beer on her face to wake her up.  After kissing her, he unceremoniously tosses her out on the street.  When she returns, he kisses her some more, before pushing her down, taking all the money out of her purse, and then shaking her down for more money.  And, of course, by this time she is hopelessly in love with him.  In what universe is this possible?  None, but for the sake of the drama we accept it effortlessly.

The film is stuffed with marvelous details, whether dialogue, music, or sets.  No one seeing the film could ever forget Skip's bizarre waterfront lodgings, in which he cools his beer (and stores his booty) by lowering a wooden box into the East River with a rope.  Among dozens of great touches, one of my favorites is when a stoolie, eating Chinese food, takes his tip money and puts it in his pocket using chopsticks.  The score, by the relatively unknown Leigh Harline, nonetheless manages to be almost as edgy as Edward Hermann.

Interestingly, for all the film's cynicism and edginess, it actually ends up with a more conventional happy ending than most of the hardboiled crime films of the forties and fifties.  The guy and the gal end up together, and perhaps even happy.  Moe tells Skip,  ""Stop using your hands, Skip, and start using your head.""  He does, and all ends well.  By the end, the bad guys are all either dead or in jail.  What is fascinating about all this is that it was a direct violation of the Code, which decreed that all characters who engage in crime must be shown as paying for those crimes by the end of the film (which is why all those Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney villains of the thirties always died by the end of the film).  Skip McCoy is not only a creep, he is a thief, yet at the end he is not only punished:  he is given a clean bill of health for cooperating in taking down Commies.  As such, he is one of the most unique anti-heroes of the age.

This is an absolute must-see film though I would like to add that for a Criterion film, this has perhaps the smallest number of first-rate features that I can recall.  The print itself is pristine and gorgeous, but you get no additional video features.  All the features are either articles or printed interviews.",1094342400,64,4555,4.57283950617284

385048,5,630196697X,"Samuel Fuller's ""Pickup on South Street"" is easily one of his better films and as cynical and tough as crime dramas got in the 50's. Richard Widmark is excellent as a cocky pickpocket who swipes the wallet of sexy Jean Peters that contains microfilm of government secrets to be delivered to a Communist agency. Peters is unaware of the Communist angle and is only doing a ""job"" for her slimy ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley (who's also excellent). Getting mixed up in the mess to get back the microfilm is street peddler/police informant Thelma Ritter who sells information to whoever wants to buy it. The film is gritty and unsentimental and none of the characters are saints. New York City is depicted as a tough place to survive especially on the dirty waterfront where Skip McCoy (Widmark) lives and stashes his loot and Moe Williams (Ritter) plies her trade. Candy (Peters) is a girl who's been around due to a shady past and never known a decent man in her life. She's trying to survive too. Peters (who's miles away from her ingenue in ""Niagara"" also the same year} is sexy and streetsmart with the bad-girl swagger that only Gloria Grahame knew how to pull off. Ritter earned an Oscar nomination for her role as Moe and she is simply fantastic as a doomed fringe-dweller who's getting tired. The film is a good hard look at crime and the school of hard knocks. The Communist plot line is only that---a plot line. The film takes no political stand. It's a story of people doing what they do to survive and the understanding between them that ""everybody's gotta eat"".

Or at least you don't understand it."" It's a bold statement-one that sums up the attitude of Fuller's movies. He was a filmmaker who could never be accused of being wishy-washy on any topic. His films take forceful stances on a specific issue, be it Communism or war or personal honour. They are stripped-down, straightforward masterpieces that pull no punches. Pickup On South Street was Fuller's unflinching take on the Cold War. Even though he made the majority of his films within the studio system, very few have been released on DVD (or on video for that matter). The Criterion Collection previously released Shock Corridor and The Naked Kiss with excellent transfers but only theatrical trailers as supplemental material.

""Sam Fuller on Pickup On South Street"" is an interview with the filmmaker by film critic Richard Schickel (taken from an longer piece he did for Turner Classic Movies). It's great just to hear Fuller tell anecdotes in his trademark hardboiled delivery-a passionate, gravelly voice.
""Cinema Cinemas: Fuller"" is an interview with the man that originally aired on French television in 1982. The closest we get to an audio commentary on this DVD is footage of Fuller watching the opening reel of Pickup On South Street and gleefully talking over the footage.
""Headlines and Hollywood"" is a well-written essay of Fuller's life and career that provides excellent insight into his background as a tabloid journalist that informed his movies.
""Recollections from Richard Widmark"" is an interview with the film's star, taken from Lee Server's book, Sam Fuller: Film Is a Battleground.
Also included are trailers for nine of Fuller's films. They all look fantastic and make you instantly want to see each and every one of them.
Finally, there is a collection of stills from the movie, a poster Fuller filmography and illustrations by Russell Christian that accompanied the screenplay of the movie when it was published in Scenario magazine in 1998.
The Criterion Collection has come through again with a stunning transfer that beautifully restores this film noir classic. For people who haven't had the opportunity to see any of Fuller's work, this is a great introduction into his hardboiled, un-sentimentalized world.",1077494400,6,2607,5.16548463356974

7817715,4,630196697X,"The American director Samuel Fuller (1912 -- 1997) was known for cheesy low-budget B-flims, some of which have become highly regarded in the years following his death. Among his better-known movies is ""Pickup on South Street"", released in 1953.  The title suggests a focus on a sexual encounter, but the term ""pickup"" refers to the pickpocketing of classified government information for delivery to USSR agents during the Cold War. The microfilmed secrets alluded to the Rosenbergs, who were executed that year for passing microfilmed information to the Soviet Union, and perhaps to Alger Hiss. Fuller also wrote the screenplay for the movie.

Set in New York City, the film stars Richard Widmark as petty thief Richard McCoy, a three time loser, and Jean Peters as Candy, a prostitute and the former girlfriend of Joey (Richard Kiley), a communist spy. Candy is delivering the microfilm to Joey's bosses, thinking that it consists of confidential business information,  when Richard steals it on a crowded New York City subway under the surveillance of the police. The incident begins the crowded, tangled plot to recover the information Thelma Ritter co-stars in the film as Moe, an aging, lonely snitch who sells information to the police and to most others willing to pay. Ritter's portrayal earned an Academy Award nomination.

With the focus on espionage, the interest of the film lies elsewhere, including its portrayal of early 1950's life with its rigid dress and its ever-present smoking. The movie is strong on noir atmosphere and on characterization. It offers a vision of city life with its crowded subways, fast pace, and lonely people. In addition to the subways, the movie offers views of the shabby New York waterfront, where Richard holes up in a shack, of Moe's barren apartment, and of third rate crooks dining by themselves as they accept cash for information. The people in the film are lonely and disengaged, from the police and Federal agents doing their jobs, to the grifting loser Richard, to the tawdry Candy searching for love, and to Moe, who seems to want no more from life than a proper burial. The dialogue is punchy and colloquial.  The film is dark even with its half-hearted attempt to create a happy ending.

The cinematography, acting, and portrayal of urban loneliness made ""Pickup on South Street"" worth seeing.  Admirers of film noir will enjoy the movie.
