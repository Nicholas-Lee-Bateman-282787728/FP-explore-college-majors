5660238,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"I was surprised that I liked the movies so much. The fourth book was not my favorite by far, but the movies, especially the second part, were AWESOME!",1364947200,,150,4.392857142857143
5660239,1,B00BNQ7PUS,"Ever since I read the epic disaster that was ""Breaking Dawn,"" I have been eagerly anticipating these movies. It was one of the vilest, silliest, grossest books I've ever read in my life, and I assumed that the movie would at least be funny. I mean, there's a scene where Edward chews open Bella's uterus!

Well, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Parts 1 and 2"" managed to disappoint me. While there are some jaw-droppingly stupid moments, most of this two-part story is blindingly dull -- there's more padding than actual story here, riddled with painfully awkward acting, monotonous sex scenes, and lots of important topics (like abortion) that the writers aren't NEARLY smart enough to address. Also: the most anticlimactic ending EVER.

Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are finally getting married... which we see every boring awkward moment of. After flying off to a private island (not kidding), they finally have sex. But then, Bella unexpectedly gets pregnant (sex leads to pregnancy? WHAT A TWIST!). Except Rosalie, the Cullens all want her to abort the monster baby, but Bella refuses to do so even though it's killing her (and no, nobody suggests a Caesarian. Why? Because ""Twilight"").

But the discovery that a monster baby is killing Bella somehow causes the werewolves to attack, because for some reason they care about all this. Oh, and aforementioned uterus-chewing scene.

But don't worry: Bella later wakes up a vampire, and she's the speshulest and sparkliest of all. However, her creepy kid with Edward attracts the attention of the Volturi, who have forbidden the making of any vampire children -- and now they're coming to Forks to wipe them out. So the Cullens call in all their friends (none of whom have EVER been introduced before) to help them make a final stand. Or not.

The worst thing about these dreadful movies is that they broke the ludicrous ""Breaking Dawn"" story into two separate movies. This works when you have an epic story (""The Hobbit"") or a plot-heavy one (""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows""). But for a tween-porn romance about how special Bella is for having a functioning uterus, it's the kiss of death.

So to fill out all the space NOT occupied by plot or characterization, the movie is crammed with padding. Lots of padding. Endless padding. Even the SEX feels like it has been padded -- I spent most of the PG-13 sex scenes wondering if Bella would ever change expression during sex (and no, she didn't). And even when the Volturi learn of the Creepy Demonspawn's existence, the padding doesn't go away. Instead we're treated to endless scenes of new vampires hanging around the Cullen mansion, showing off their sooper-kewl powers to the audience.

I will give director Bill Condon some credit -- he does try to lessen the grotesquely hellish birth scene, and the subsequent pedophilic squick of Jacob ""imprinting"" on a newborn baby. Additionally, he created a truly riveting, graphically violent climax for the second movie that is frankly pretty awesome... until you discover it was all a dream. Yes, we're left with no resolution whatsoever. Everyone just goes home.

The acting is pretty much what you would expect by now. Kristen Stewart is awkward, mumbly, graceless and incapable of moving her face like a human being, and Robert Pattinson looks bored and detached. His character's true repulsiveness is revealed in full here -- not only is Edward a controlling misogynistic stalker, but he tries to emotionally blackmail his wife into getting an abortion. Mr. Dreamy!

Taylor Lautner's Jacob also loses what shreds of likability he had, when suddenly he discovers he's the Troo Luv of a newborn baby. Ew. There are actually a lot of good smaller performances -- mostly from the random ""new"" vampires who pop up to help the Cullens -- but they're pretty much wasted. But Michael Sheen is hilarious -- his campy, cackling, bug-eyed performance is absolutely delightful.

""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2"" takes a plotless lump of drivel, and stretches it out over two full-length movies -- but let's face it, it would have been a disaster even as one. Avoid these movies like you owe them money.",1364515200,,4190,4.947368421052632
5660240,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"This is the only way to get BOTH Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Part 2 on the same dvd.  Great movies that were faithful to the books.  My daughter will love it. Great idea for a Twilight fan as a gift since its an exclusive item.
Fantastic video quality.  Great audio.  Plenty of special features.
Hopefully the series continues!!",1362960000,5,325,4.4576271186440675
5660241,1,B00BNQ7PUS,"Don't understand why this movie is soo over priced I ordered the pre- order on amazon the same one got it the day it was supposed to come out and has the same that this version of the movie nothing more or nothing less, if you want the ones with the gifts I would recommend to get it from target, best buy or Barnes and noble they all come with nice gifts but still the price is decent , hope this help to save you some money :)",1362873600,4,428,3.875
5660242,1,B00BNQ7PUS,"Walmart has this exact same set for $22.96 plus shipping, which comes to $24 and some change all together. The Blu ray set is only a couple of dollars more. Do not buy this set from Amazon for $49.99 with free 2 day shipping.

This is available to buy from other sellers, so it you want to order it through Amazon that's probably the best thing to do because then you'll be getting it even cheaper. I saw one for $20.36 with shipping.

Oh and BTW, if you get this edition, Breaking Dawn Part 2 will not include any special features, which in this case would be the 7 part documentary. It will not be included in this set. You will be getting Breaking Dawn Part 1 - The Extended Edition and Breaking Dawn Part 2 the movie. That's it.",1362700800,81,732,4.2214285714285715

5660286,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"The Twilight Saga inclusive is a masterpiece story written by Stephenie Meyers. The movies are amazingly true to each of the books.  What's noteworthy is decision to go with 4 different directors to tell the story installments, yet never losing grip of the saga. My review for each of the Twilight movies are EXCELLENT.  By the way, the books were recommended to me by a fellow teacher, which surprised me because we're both not ""spring chickens"" (LOL).  But I saw it as excellent in content and technique as any American movie classic. If you love screen soundtracks and scores, you'll also love the use of music techniques for each of the movies.",1464652800,2,648,4.767857142857143

Very disappointed.  The extended edition only applied to Part 1.  So the title was misleading.  If you look closely at the package cover it only mentions the extended edition under part one.

5660341,1,B00BNQ7PUS,"The descriptions and frenetic hype is deliberately confusing and misleading. All I wanted was the BD2 extended version which apparently does not exist. They're raking in plenty extra dough by doublespeak and repackaging the same old thing over and over again. I wind up with one Theatrical version of BD1, 2 extended versions of BD1, and 2 versions of BD2.. Wrongly assumed that the extended versions of BD 1 and2 would be in this combo",1391472000,5,436,4.826666666666667
5660342,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"This is a great movie. I love it because it doesn't have a bunch of profanity, I can watch with the kids (ages 5-17) and they absolutely love it. It brings us together for movie time because we all like the whole Twilight series.",1389830400,,229,4.2272727272727275

5660350,1,B00BNQ7PUS,"First off, the movies shipped late ""supposedly,"" and I say supposedly because after it shipped late and after a few weeks, I never even received the movies. I contacted the seller and they just told me to contact amazon, even though I gave THEM my money in return for the movies. Anyway, I contacted the mail carrier services, asked the mailman, post office, everything. I didn't get a refund or the movies. I'm highly upset that I just wasted money.",1380240000,,450,4.6375

5660353,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"I had purchased the other three movies in the series without the director commentary feature, so these were a treat.

5660357,4,B00BNQ7PUS,"Part 2 is the best one - Kristen Stewart finally does a decent acting job.  The baby though? a bit over-the-top unbelievable.  Once she's a toddler you can stop laughing hysterically.  Entertaining regardless. Fight scene - or should I say fight flash forward, is good.  Worth the money for the set.",1376611200,,299,4.803921568627451
5660358,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"What can I say about these two movies?  Part 1 gives you the set up and the final movie delivers.  It may not be as long as the usual, but it gets  the message across.  If you haven't purchased the final installments yet, I say go for it. You will enjoy them!",1376438400,,259,3.923076923076923

5660363,5,B00BNQ7PUS,"This movie 2 disc pack is a great deal for the money, which I purchased used. I only wish that both DVD's had extended editions rather than just the first part. The second DVD is only the single non-extended theatrical released version. However, this does not effect the quality of the items, their content or the DVD's themselves. This is a great deal and added the final two movies of this series to my Twilight collection, all in one single inexpensive purchase.",1374278400,,465,4.682926829268292

5660379,1,B00BNQ7PUS,"I could get past the sparkly vampire thing because I like the actors portraying the main characters in the Twilight saga, I never read the books so was unaware of the ending that was coming. Anyone who is watching this series and has not read the books should be aware that the ending may be very unforgiving in it's complete LAMENESS as the awesome fight sequence turns out to be a vision! The story offers very bad closure for those wanting to see the ""villains"" get their deserved ending. I am so disappointed for having wasted my money on this series. stupid. stupid. stupid.",1366934400,,579,4.576923076923077
