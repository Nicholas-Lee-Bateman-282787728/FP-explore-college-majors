8142622,4,B000HZWIBW,"Packaged with the box set British War Movies, this one has the least bit of war to it. This is a crime story about smugglers who use a war surplus MTB for the bad things that they do. If I was watching it in that context it would rate a 4 of 5 amazon rating which I have rated it, but as part of a ""War"" box set its miscast. and only rates a 2 of 5 for the first 10 minutes.",1185408000,6,374,3.573170731707317
