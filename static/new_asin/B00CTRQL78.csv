8586150,5,B00CTRQL78,"The Archvists at Arrow Video have delved into the Euro Western coffers and released a great title from Italy's golden age.  Director Ferdinando Baldi's 'DJANGO PREPARE A COFFIN' aka 'PREPARATI LA BARA' aka 'GET THE COFFIN READY' aka 'VIVA DJANGO'- 1968 (WHEW!!) would have been a direct sequel to Director Sergio Corbucci""s dynamite original from 1966.  Without Franco Nero who had other commitments, the Producers went with Terence Hill  who resembled Nero in some respect.  With great villainy in German actor Horst Frank and Actor/Writer George Eastman aka Luigi Montifiori . this film emerges as an excellently fast paced tale of revenge. It's great to see Hill  in serious mode before his rise to stardom with Director Enzo Barboni's 'THEY CALL ME TRINITY' aka 'LO CHIAMAVANO TRINITA'- 1970.  Barboni is behind the camera this time and it shows.  Arrow's Blu-Ray transfer is quite nice with a 1.85 1080p transfer ,sometimes  overly bright in some scenes (but why nitpick?} and has optional English and Italian audio tracks with both highlighting the catchy music score by Gianpiero Reverberi.  The extras are kind of skimpy with a 12 minute featurette DJANGO EXPLAINED narrated by Author Kevin Grant who's excellent tome 'ANY GUN CAN PLAY' is the definitive study of the Euro Western and an Original trailer.  Too bad they couldn't get an interview with actor Terence Hill.  This release is a must have for Euro Western fans and lets hope Arrow releases more titles in the future.",1504396800,,1485,5.045081967213115

8586152,4,B00CTRQL78,"For most of us the only interaction weve ever had when it came to spaghetti westerns (those westerns made by Italian directors and companies in the 60s and 70s) were the Clint Eastwood films in the genre. What many may not be aware of is the fact that there were a ton of these movies made. In addition to that was the fact that several series were made in the genre. Perhaps the most well-known was Django. With director Quentin Tarantino bringing the character into todays films a few years ago, interest in the previous movies has piqued the interest of movie fans. Now one has received the Arrow Video treatment.

DJANGO PREPARE A COFFIN begins with Django (Terence Hill) turning down a job opportunity from David Barry (Horst Frank) after saving him from an angry land owner. Barry is in the process of taking as much land as possible and building an empire for himself in the hope of becoming a large political figure for the area. After turning down the job, Django, his wife and a small group of settlers head out only to be ambushed, shot and left for dead by Barrys men. Django survives and sets out on a trail of vengeance.

He moves to a nearby location where no one knows who he is and takes on the job of local hangman. But this isn't actually the case. Each of his victims is instructed on how to behave when they are hung. The reality is that he has them rigged to just appear dead. In return for their lives Django is assembling a group of men he considers innocent and victims of an unjust system as well. These are the men he hopes to use as his gang when taking on the despicable Barry.

Apparently he didn't choose the men carefully enough as one leads the rest to abandon him and steal a shipment of gold before Barrys gang can reach it. His treachery continues and Django is caught by Barry and his men and tortured. Left while they attempt to catch the men who stole the gold, Django finds a way to set himself free and continues on his quest for revenge against both Barry and the men that betrayed him.

The movie offers plenty of action and story, perhaps more than many films in the genre. Django is the clear hero here but he doesnt use the heroic methods weve become accustomed to in most westerns. Hes quick with a gun but uses his head to better effect. Hill is the perfect choice for the role having had success in several other spaghetti westerns before and after, most notably the Trinity series. But that comedic attitude isn't on display here, instead opting for a more deadly character portrayal.

Not having collected movies in this genre before my best guess is that quality prints have been hard to find and both bootleg and lesser quality prints have had to suffice for fans. Not so any longer as Arrow Video has given this film their standard love and care. What we have is a stunning quality print to view for fans and just movie lovers both. Perhaps the only thing lacking in their version is the amount of extras to be found. Im not a lover of extras but thats become different with Arrow. Their extras are almost always new and refreshing compared to most. Here they limit it to a short called
Django Explained a new interview with Spaghetti Western expert and author Kevin Grant and the theatrical trailer.

That being said it remains a quality product and one that fans will want to add to their collection. Non-fans will want to make sure they give it a watch just to see how good these movies were. And Arrow fans will add this to their collections as well, knowing the quality theyll receive when they do so.",1501200000,2,3560,4.444104134762634

8586154,5,B00CTRQL78,"This 1968 hour and a half film is another very good Spegetti western. It is filled with action. Many people are shot. The style, like other Spegetti westerns has lots of long looks, unusual clothes, and nice music. A man overly interested in gold has his gang rob Django and kill his wife. Django is shot many times and makes believe he is dead. It is now five years later. Django gathers together men to help him get revenge by acting as a hangman and saving innocent men who are about to be hanged. He goes after the man who killed his wife. But things go wrong, many things.",1494806400,,577,4.302752293577981
8586155,3,B00CTRQL78,"Anyone with even a passing interest in Spaghetti Westerns has certainly run across Django.  The character, introduced in Sergio Corbucci's 1966 film and played by Franco Nero, was co-opted by countless producers for completely unrelated projects simply for name recognition.  There was only one official sequel, but 1968's Django, Prepare a Coffin is almost as legit, with the same writer, cinematographer and newcomer Terence Hill as a near-perfect stand in for Franco titular tragic hero.

The film begins with a Django (Hill) coming to the aid of an aspiring politician, David Barry, (Horst Frank) but turning down the job offer of ""enforcer"" in the new administration.  Miffed at the refusal, Barry orders his men - led by the merciless Lucas (George Eastman) to hijack a cargo of gold Django is charged with delivering, murder his wife and leave the gunslinger for dead.

Fast forward five years.  Django is alive and working as a hangman, all part of an elaborate plan for revenge.  Each condemned man - falsely accused of their involvement in the ongoing gold hijacking operation - is saved from the gallows by a hidden contraption.  Django then recruits these ""phantoms"" to join his crusade to bring down Barry and clear their names.  Unfortunately, greed gets the better of Garcia, who sees his resurrection as a chance to double-cross the rest of the gang...and leaving Django's plan for payback at the end of a rope.

Ostensibly a prequel, director Ferdinando Baldi hits on some familiar refrains (coffins, torture, machine guns) in an attempt to repeat the first Django's success.  Ultimately there's just not enough action to sustain the audience's interest after the initial ""hanging plot"" is revealed.  Frank and Eastman make for a particularly memorable pair of heavies, though, and Terence Hill effectively imitates Nero's look - if not his charisma.

What it does have that the dozens of other Django imitators don't is a clever hook and authentic outlaw attitude.  Cinematographer Enzo Barboni, who would reunite with Terence Hill again on the series of Trinity western-comedies, jumps through genre hoops like an old pro, building off the dusty landscapes and run-down saloons Leone had originated four years earlier.  There's nothing here we haven't seen before - and would see again - but Django, Prepare a Coffin is still a solid Spaghetti Western...and one of the few titles that deserve the Django moniker.

Arrow Video offers up a new hi-def transfer in the original 1.66:1 aspect ratio along with an 8-minute video essay entitled Django Explained, which briefly covers the Django craze and this particular entry's place in history.  The first pressing only contains an illustrated collector's booklet with liner notes from Spaghetti Western expert Howard Hughes.",1493683200,8,2789,5.189732142857143
8586156,3,B00CTRQL78,"Django: Prepare a Coffin stars Terence Hill as the wandering gunslinger of the title. Django is double crossed by his ambitious politician friend David Barry (Horst Frank) when Barry organizes a gang of bandits to stage a series of robberies. One of these robberies is of a wagon full of gold being driven by Django, and during the robbery, Djangos wife is killed and Django is wounded and left for dead.

Five years later, he is working as a district hangman for a corrupt local politician who is framing innocent men, sending them to hang in an evil scheme to take hold of their land. But Django has other ideas and cleverly fakes the deaths of the condemned men, assembling them into a loyal gang who will help him take down the boss, a man who had a hand in the death of Djangos wife.

Franco Nero, who starred in the original Django (1966), was originally signed to star in this film, but left the project for a job offer in Hollywood. Director Ferdinando Baldi and producer Manolo Bolognan hired Hill primarily because of his resemblance to Nero.

The film, in keeping with spaghetti Westerns of the period, contains lots of violence in the form of fist fights, shoot-outs, and the scene in which a greatly outnumbered Django wields a machine gun and mows down his adversaries, evening the odds. Hill plays Django in the style of Clint Eastwood. Hes a man of few words and lots of action.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD release include Django Explained, a new interview with spaghetti Western author Kevin Grant, and the original trailer. The film has both Italian and English audio tracks, and optional English subtitles.",1493078400,3,1641,4.7073170731707314
8586157,5,B00CTRQL78,"The only Django sequel that's truly a sequel, featuring the original Django character. The many others just rip-off the character's name for commercial reasons. Even when Nero later reprised the character it just wasn't the same man. Hill is spot-on as Django, even fooling some into thinking he's the original actor.  DJANGO PREPARE A COFFIN is a Spaghetti Western that has just been dying for a quality release and I'm so glad that it's finally on the way. Lots of action, violence, shooting, killing and one of the best Spaghetti Western soundtracks ever. Given the manufacturer's record of classic quality releases you just know this is going to be another winner. Can't wait for April, baseball and Terence Hill as Django.",1485216000,5,727,5.008264462809917
8586158,4,B00CTRQL78,"Very good 'sequel' to the original Django, Hill pulls it off and does resemble Nero. All SW elements present and fine cinematography. More inclined to give 3.5 stars but 4 wouldn't be wrong.",1473292800,2,190,4.787878787878788
