This astute profile of environmentalist David Brower takes us on a journey through a key juncture of the evolution of the environmental movement.  Monumental is a very important film for everyone to see--especially for young people who care about the wilderness.",1132272000,2,344,5.37037037037037
2345152,5,B000A0GY1Y,"Monumental is essential-- not only for those who value (and worry about) the beauty and vulnerability of the outdoors, but for anyone looking to spend some time with an inspiring story and some really first-rate documentary filmmaking. Seriously, don't miss this! (And check out the fantastic soundtrack as well!) I look forward to Duane's next move.",1128556800,2,350,5.267857142857143
2345153,5,B000A0GY1Y,"We could all use a little environmental inspiration right now, and Kelly Duane's Monumental is so beautiful, so moving, so in touch with what's wonderful about the natural world it's almost impossible to imagine someone watching it without renewing his or her love for the earth. Duane had the brilliance to use Brower's original footage to show us how he saw the planet first-hand. Then she also had the vision and amazing taste to set that film to music that miraculously makes Brower's vision feel both cool and sublime.",1128470400,,523,4.887640449438202
2345154,5,B000A0GY1Y,"Moving beyond the political partisanship of today, Monumental is a fascinating documentary chronicling the birth of the modern environmental movement in America using David Brower's own footage.  Duane creates a powerful portrait of why stewardship of the environment matters beyond today's soundbites, and chronicles the success of the early leaders at preservng some of the most important monuments in the West, as well as some that were inevitably lost.  Anyone who has witnessed the beauty of Point Reyes and vast parts of the Sierra Nevada will recognize in this footage what was saved and what could easly have been lost. Totally inspiring! Great for students!",1128384000,3,666,5.333333333333333

8071266,5,B000A0GY1Y,"This documentary shows how hard the fight was to save these natural wonders and that the fight is never over, as the greed and avarice of the moneyed few continue to attempt to consume or control their use for their own personal gain. These are the property of all the people and must be protected from the exploitation and abuse of the rich and powerful interests of the one percent!",1466208000,,384,4.5

8071272,5,B000A0GY1Y,"Monumental depicts the personal history and growth of David Brower as the preeminent environmentalist of the 20th century. The film shows how his early climbing expeditions, his relationship with Ansel Adams and that of Yosemite National Park influence his growing commitment to environmentalism.  The ultimate tribute to his life long work and leadership in the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and the Earth Island Institute, along with his effective lobbying of the U.S. Congress, are the many National Parks and Monuments that he was instrumental in either creating or preserving.  Kudos of this film are well deserved!",1280620800,,624,5.357142857142857
8071273,1,B000A0GY1Y,"I eagerly anticipated this movie and am profoundly disappointed.
Dave and Anne Brower were friends of my family, so I have some knowledge of them as people. Yet this movie narrowly focuses on Dave Brower's accomplishments to the exclusion of all else. In no sense is this a portrait of the real person, Dave Brower. Where did his talent and persistence come from, thin air? How did he come to be the true hero he was? We'll never know from this movie.
Anne Brower is merely mentioned, yet she had much to do with Dave's success. Son Ken is given some credit for working with his father, but little is said of the fact that he has successfully stepped out of his father's giant shadow and is successful in his own right, with due regard for his father's influence. There is no mention of daughter Barbara, a successful college professor whose specialty is Himalayan anthropology. Hmmm. I wonder why she chose that specialty?
The movie does a fair job of presenting some of Brower's major accomplishments. But its narrow focus in the end fails to inform us of the essence of why these accomplishments occurred: who was Dave Brower?
Usually I won't criticize something for what it doesn't claim to do. And I know that money is tight. However, sorry, for me this was a wasted opportunity.
And lose the surfing music.",1278720000,2,1312,4.6594827586206895
