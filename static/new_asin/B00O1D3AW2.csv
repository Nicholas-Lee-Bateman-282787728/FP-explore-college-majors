6698730,4,B00O1D3AW2,I had heard that this would be the end of the series.  It is a very good adventure that the series can end on while still being open for more it really isn't the end.,1438473600,,166,3.742857142857143
6698731,5,B00O1D3AW2,Good movie it actually make me want another season to be made soon!,1434758400,,67,4.230769230769231
6698732,5,B00O1D3AW2,"If you wanted to see them marry, this is as close as you get. Tiger uses his experience much better here than in the series, but the other heroes seem to have fallen in their competency.  Interesting NEXT villains, but no word on Ouroboros.",1433980800,2,240,4.454545454545454
6698733,5,B00O1D3AW2,I was glad to finally see a movie that continued on from where the t.v. series left off.  The story and animation were excellent!,1431475200,,129,4.375

6698736,5,B00O1D3AW2,"This is the final chapter in the story of our favorite heroes and it doesn't disappoint. Kotetsu learns to adjust to his waning NEXT abilities. There is more background revealed for Fire Emblem. Ways Barnaby finds to put meaning into his life and go on after reaching his goal of catching his parents killer are shown.  We meet a new NEXT that is add to the mix as Barnaby's partner, Golden Ryan. Of course, we also meet back up with all the other HEROTV NEXT of Sternbild . The same quality of story telling is maintained in this movie, and I really enjoyed it! Without being overly spoiler-ific, I will just add that Tiger learns his value to Sternbild City and his fellow NEXT.

The extras it comes with are the typical promotion adds and title free beginning and end themes.",1425168000,7,778,4.51063829787234
6698737,3,B00O1D3AW2,This was a Fun Movie. the Animation was Excellent. The super hero being tv stars was a nice touch. If I was true fan of this series I would give it more stars. I give it 3 stars because I won't be re-watching this one. IF you are fan its a must buy.,1425081600,2,249,3.7169811320754715

8681327,4,B00O1D3AW2,"Great for a tiger and bunny fan of the series.
I would not recommend to someone who has never seen or liked the series, but I def would recommend to add to your overall collection. There was more character development for our side characters especially Fire Emblem; and without giving too much away, it focuses on a rare side of LGBT struggles for his character as a whole.
I wish that ""Golden Ryan"" had a bigger role in this movie, he seemed as a add on and had nothing much to do with the main plot other then a small delay to separate Tiger and Bunny before the inevitable reunion of their bromantic teamwork. The antagonists could have been studied better as well, as their evil skims were sort of rushed to reach a conclusion.
Overall, felt like a long episode to add to the series. It was not the best movie, no, but i would recommend seeing as it did have some redeeming qualities and strong animation, and was a pleasure for fans of the original series. I'm glad to add it to my collection.",1489536000,,998,4.370967741935484
8681328,3,B00O1D3AW2,The disk is different zone so I have to open from my PC. It should not have zone-protect.,1484092800,,89,4.0
8681329,2,B00O1D3AW2,"Big fan of Tiger & Bunny but this movie was just ok. You do not see the main characters very much and the animation is not great. Anyone who has watched the series & first movie will some big changes in the way the characters look (Dragon Kid looks like a little boy & even dresses like one)  & even act. The script is more like from Hollywood than Japan.  Way too much SJW trope in this edition and does nothing for the story line. IF you skip this, you will be missing nothing meaningful to the series.",1469923200,,504,4.13265306122449
8681330,5,B00O1D3AW2,This alpaca is so adorable and fluffy! I wasn't expecting him to be so soft but found myself hugging him like any soft pillow out there! The details in his clothes are accurate and just as nice to pet. I love everything about him! :),1458259200,,233,4.2

8681333,4,B00O1D3AW2,"Typically I'm not one to get anime movies, even for anime I like.  They tend to come off as little more than slightly longer episodes with little real story (I'm looking at you Dragonball).  But after seeing the clips of this on YouTube, I just had to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed.  It even FEELS like a continuation of the series.  The only reason it loses a star is because they could have made a season out of this.  Other than that, if you're a Tiger and Bunny fan, this is a definite must see.",1456012800,,509,4.153061224489796
8681334,5,B00O1D3AW2,Enjoyed watching the movie after seeing the first two seasons.  The kids enjoyed watching this.,1443484800,,95,5.333333333333333
