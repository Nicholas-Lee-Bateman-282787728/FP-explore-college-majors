8304624,5,B001G9CNQ8,"With a straight-face, no expressions whatsoever, Buster Keaton takes on absurdities, nonsense, comic situations head on.

Keaton's gift was showing no emotions, looking dead serious, stone-face, deadpan emotions, while in dire straits. End result: pure comedy. It seems as if he plays both the straight man and the dupe at the same time. He gives the impression of being an average guy caught in turmoil, constantly in trouble. In pure conflict. His problems always lead to ridiculous, absurd, comic problem solving endings.

This double header dual role of straight-man/dupe is quite interesting. And to say the least: brilliant. He plays his parts flawlessly.

 In the first short film, The railrodder, Keaton speeds through the Canadian Rocky Mountains in his one-seat open rail car, track speeder, trying desperately to avoid crashing head-on into huge rumbling locomotives.

This short film was made in 1965. About 50 years after Keaton lit up the screen with his hilarious, knee-slapping, oddball comedies. The scenes of the majestically beautiful rocky mountain ice-caps and peaks are filmed in color, giving the odd balance of having a silent movie star riding his little train car under bright blue skies. Nonetheless,, Keaton's deadpan expressions throughout his harrowing, ordeals in the midst of ongoing turmoil, also known as comic absurdities keeps the short film interesting from Point A to Point B on his way through the spectacular Rockies.

The second short film features Keaton in a bar looking at the Academy Awards on TV. The program is hosted by comic legend Bob Hope. Inside, the bar are the regular customers. They argue to whittle away the hours of the night spent adrift.

Inside the bar, Keaton is finally recognized by the customers as the famous silent movie actor of yesteryear. Once the bar patrons realize who he is, the personal arguments, bickering, among the customers rekindle. And Hope continues to hand out Oscars. Life goes on.

As a twin treat, these two short films starring Keaton show off his immense talent of playing an average Joe caught up in mayhem. What makes Keaton funny is his stone-face expression in midst of being stuck in a crumbling mess. He plays two characters at the same time. He's like Laurel and Hardy wrapped into one package: a straight man, the other, a fall guy.

Too bad there were no Academy Awards during his silent movie career. Keaton would have taken home plenty of Oscars. Nevertheless, his talents are on full display in these two short historic short films. Both show once again why Keaton was a movie icon for absurdity.",1443744000,4,2597,5.049065420560748

it is not even close to being his best work, but if you are a buster keaton fan this worth seeing",1399161600,3,188,3.725
8304629,5,B001G9CNQ8,"This video contains items that have been in other videos, but the Silent Partner was new to me.  Even if the story line has issues, still seeing ol' Buster is worth the price of admission.",1361318400,,188,4.371428571428571
