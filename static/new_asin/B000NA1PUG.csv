2763169,5,B000NA1PUG,It was suppose to release Sept. 25th but since the 5th season isn't due until early 2008 they are pushing the release of the 4th season on dvd. I wish it was sooner =T,1184198400,13,167,3.9411764705882355
2763170,5,B000NA1PUG,Over in Ireland we're only half way through season 4 but it has been the best so far. I can't wait for it to come out on dvd. I have all the other seasons on dvd boxset and can't wait to add this season to my collection. Can anybody tell me the fate of One Tree Hill. Is it coming back for a fifth season?,1184198400,2,305,3.707692307692308
2763171,5,B000NA1PUG,"This season is by far the greatest season of One Tree Hill yet. If there is one word to describe this season, it would be addictive. This season has some
unforgettable story lines, twists and surprises and introduces new characters from Peyton being stalked, Nathan cheating at the game he loves, Ravens winning the state championship, Peyton And Lucas finally being together, Graduation and Dan facing the harsh consequences for killing his brother and many more. This fourth season is a season no fan of One Tree Hill should ever miss. I highly recommend this season as a must have on DVD. You will not regret having it as part of your DVD collection.",1181779200,21,653,4.7368421052631575

2763206,4,B000NA1PUG,Great teenage drama show that grew with the audience. I really enjoyed the ideas behind the series that two brothers who were kept apart start to become close. Watching all the drama behind that and the character development of each main character was great. The series starts out a little on the nave (younger side) but it grows into a pretty powerful show by the end.,1412812800,,369,4.606060606060606

2763209,5,B000NA1PUG,"I sure miss reruns of this show on SoapNET. Glad I bought the DVD boxed set off amazon. Season 4 is the conclusion to the series in my honest opinion. Season 5 time jumps almost 5 years after season 4 ends and the whole feel of the show changes. I can repeatedly watch OTH seasons 1 - 4. Anything after that is really hard for me to watch. It feels like the whole series was written just to make the fans happy and to keep the show from being cancelled.

I personally rate the seasons of One Tree Hill like this. 1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 9, 8, 7. In that order. Best to worst. Seasons 1, 3, & 4 are 5 Stars. Season 2 & 6 are 4 stars. Seasons 5 & 9 are 3 stars. Season 8 is 1 star and season 7 is so bad it should get negative 5 stars.",1410998400,,727,3.6903225806451614

2763215,5,B000NA1PUG,"Haley finds out she is pregnant, gets hit by a car, becomes valedictorian, and a mom all in the same season and Nathan grows even more mentally and emotionally this season.  Lucas is determined to find out who killed Keith and Karen is pregnant as well.  Peyton is annoying this season with her stalker brother and her and Brooke fight over Lucas AGAIN.  It seems all Peyton does this season is open her eyes really wide in terror and it is really irritating when re-watching this show.  Keith comes back to show Lucas the way and the actor who plays Nathan shows so much emotional range this season it made me a real fan of his.  Brooke and Rachel became one of the highlights of the season and even when Rachel did something so horrible like try to seduce Nathan you couldn't hate her.  Overall a must have for fans of the show.",1400025600,,830,4.392156862745098

2763218,5,B000NA1PUG,"I didn't watch One Tree Hill when it aired, and I'm kind've kicking myself now because it's a really good show. I finished season 4 yesterday and it was terrific just like the first three seasons. Lots of cliffhangers this season and it never seems to let up once. The actors all do a good job too, and everyone is likeable in their own way or entertaining to watch. Hilarie Burton (Peyton) in particular is a real standout this season, and Sophia Bush (Brooke) and James Lafferty (Nathan) continue to be two of the very best characters.
We also get some supporting characters who finally become regulars ( Daneel Harris as Rachel and Antwon Tanner as Skills), and some new characters (the very cute Stephen Colletti as Brooke's new boyfriend Chase).
This season deals with Peyton being terrorized by a stalker, Dan being haunted by his own demons (and by someone who knows what really happened to Keith), Nathan getting into a mess of problems when he just tries to be a good husband and find ways to pay the bills, Brooke finding new enemies, boyfriends, and friendships (not all turn out to be positives) and Deb having to deal with a pretty bad drug addiction.
I've yet to be letdown by a season of this show, and I can't wait to watch the next. Not a single moment of boredom to found here.",1390348800,,1295,4.538461538461538

2763231,5,B000NA1PUG,I wasn't really into OTH and I didn't watch every episode but I loved season four. I think it was one of the last great seasons when everything was sort of clicking. It also has some amazing episodes and I loved that my favorite character (Rachel) was showcased more. I really wish she could have been in the latter seasons as well. As it is four is my favorite hands down.,1369526400,,373,4.267605633802817

2763233,5,B000NA1PUG,"I really enjoyed this show all the way from season 1-4, they did a good job; it was mindless entertainment & held my attention. Its a real shame that the show went on as long as it did though.
Season 4 was good, it was probably my favorite out of the entire series, mainly because they wrap up a bunch of stuff & all of the characters seem to be set in who they are finally. Im assuming they wrapped everything up because they didn't know if theyd return for season 5.
DVDs: All discs work great, the menus are straight forward & easy to use. The Special Features were fine, I think I only watched the bloopers though
If you're a One Tree Hill fan, this is a good one to add to your collection.",1365724800,,694,4.110294117647059

This season was mind blowing awesome IT'S SERIOUSLY MY FAVORITE SEASON every season is great...but none of the season can top this one. With the crazy Dereck storyline and some of my all-time favorite episodes of One Tree Hill. And this is coming from someone who's seen all the Seasons,even the one thats on TV right now,own all the boxsets,and seen EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of One Tree Hill. I love everything about this season right down to the cover. It came in perfect condition I mean absolutly no problems,it wasn't torn,bent,nothing. Thanks so much Amazon. :)

My Favorite Seasons(1-the best 7-not that great):
1. Season 4
2. Season 5
3. Season 6
4. Season 7
5. Season 3
6. Season 2
7. Season 1-only because not that much awesome drama as the characters are still trying to develop and had some dull episodes...but hey what can you expect from a starter season.

Some Of my favorite episodes are:
-4x01 ""The Same Deep Water As You""
-4x03 ""Good News For People Who Love Bad News""
-4x04 ""Can't Stop This Thing We Started""
-4x05 ""I Love You But I've Choosen Darkness""
-4x06 ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night""
-4x13 ""Pictures Of You""(one of my all-time favorite episodes)
-4x17 ""It Gets The Worst At Night""(my all-time favorite episode of OTH)
-4x20 ""The Birth and Death of the Day""
-4x21 ""All of Sudden I Miss Everyone""
As you can see they had some AMAZING episodes. All the episodes are great but these really stand out...which as you can see is half of the season. :)

Final Thoughts:
One Tree Hill Season 4 was an AWESOME one. And in my Top 5 favorite seasons of One Tree Hill as you can see OTH Season 4 falls under #1 :).On a scale 1-10 I'd give season 4 a 10,..as if you didn't already see that coming.

The cases were not the same as the other seasons and the dvd's did not start at the beginning of the episode. They did not have the opening and closing credits and they did not have the opening and closing songs. It seems to me that these are copies of the originals. I have all the other seasons and the two that I received are not at all the same as the others that I purchased at a store.

2763274,5,B000NA1PUG,"I should probably begin with the fact that when I was a kid I loved ""Dawson`s Creek"". I had a chance to watch only 2 first seasons, so I`ve purchased the rest of them from Amazon recently. BUT when I started watchin` One Tree Hill I understood that I`ve grown so much and comparing to OTH ""Dawson`s Creek"" is such a kid show, like 4/10 entertaining. So I can assure you now if you want to see the real teen drama, have a great time, then don`t hesitate a second to buy all seasons  of OTH! It has everything a good show must have: great writing, great actors and acting, fabulous music. I bet you`re not gonna be bored with this show. Even though I thought that the first season of One Tree Hill was good, the second season proved to be even better. And I can say the same thing about seasons 3 and 4. There were moments when I almost jumped because of brilliant plot twists. There were episodes when I couldn`t help crying or laughing. I thinks it proves how goog the show is;) Not to mention gorgeous DVD packaging and interesting deleted scenes and other extras. Tonight I`m going to start watching season 5 and I`m really nervous because I do care about the characters because they are so real. They make good things and mistakes just like we all do, and no matter what happens this show always gives us hope, provides us with wise thoughts, teaches us not to be bad persons. This show has a soul. A soul you feel familiar with. Like old good friend or yours. And I`m definately staying with that friend. P.S. Good bye, Dawson!;)",1225670400,,1533,4.36013986013986

2763278,5,B000NA1PUG,"I think this season was better than the first 3 put together! I can't believe  how many bad things happen to these poor teens, but no matter what, their friendships always survive. They're always there for each other and I love when Lucas jumps in to protect his loved ones.  They pretty much made their prom episode into a horror movie, which I won't complain about because I love scary movies. And Dan tried so hard to redeem  himself, but...well, you gotta watch.

At this point, you've already gotten the full price from those who were willing to pay it. When it get's down to the $20-$25 dollar mark, that's when you'll get my money.

However, I wished the writers could have made Peyton acknowledge the fact that her vanity and egotistical angst when it came to her webcam/podcasts was directly responsible for the trouble she got in with the stalker. That girl is just too dumb at times and pathetic! Hilary Burton is way too old to play a teenage girl; even though I love Haley, Bethany Joy Lenz is also too old.

Some ridiculous storylines are introduced and are hard to believe. I started not liking the characters anymore this season and found them somewhat annoying. But enjoyable? Absolutely. OTH is a great show and season 5 is sooo good. I like the characters again, so don't worry. It gets better. OTH S4 shouldn't disappoint too much, but it's just not the best. But if you're a fan you'll love it no matter what.

2763300,5,B000NA1PUG,I think it is a great season. It shows the characters getting themselves ready to leave high school and go into the real world as better people.

Most high school students do not have to go through what these teenagers are going through, but it brings back the days of Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 91210, only dealing with issues of today, like the typical high school cliques: jocks, nerds, popular vs. unpopular. Kids dealing with issues of teen pregnancy, romance, college, their futures, and of course their parents.

Season four tied all the seasons together and I enjoyed watching it more so than I did when I started watching the three previous seasons. This season has it all drama, comedy, action, and romance. I would HIGHLY recommend it!",1201478400,,770,4.746268656716418

Of course I don't agree with a lot of the activities they involve themselves in at such a young age but it's television so it's ok, I guess. I think it's a series more for 18+ yrs. because of these 'activities'.

2763335,3,B000NA1PUG,"I love one tree hill. it's like 90210 but just a bit more modern. But this past season...while it had some great moments and a somewhat interesting storyline it had it's weaknesses as well.

*Spoilers*

It opens with the ending of season 3. Nathan has just jumped into save his uncle and Rachel. Luke and Karen pull up and find Haley screaming for Nathan who hasn't come up for air. Luke jumps in to find Nathan and only manages to find cooper. They look over to the side and see Nathan with Rachel in his arms. Alright that's fine. He saved the day YAY! But then it takes an interesting twist. Nathan starts to believe that it was Keith who passed away last season, that saved them. Weird. Then it gets even more confusing. Brooke is the one that everyone thought was pregnant, but in a somewhat shocking (not if you've watched the ending of season 3 and know what's happening in 4) change of events it's actually Haley who is pregnant. Well apparently she isn't that far along. Okay that's cool...but alright now I'm gonna skip ahead a little. The gang finds out that Peyton  has a brother who she just found out about. That is the creepy freak named Derek. Well Lucas of course doesn't like him at all. She finally calls him and he hangs up on her. Then the next day he's at her door telling her that she just scared him a little but he wants to get to know her. Meanwhile Brooke has broken up with Lucas and is heartbroken when she sees him with Peyton who last season told Brooke that she had feelings for Lucas. So the stuff between Peyton and Derek keeps going and you start to think he's a great guy...who likes to take pics of his sister...way too much. Turns out he's a stalker and he tries to rape Peyton. However Lucas, who had been trying to get Derek caught by the cops, and the real Derek come to Peyton's rescue. This leads to this wonderful episode when Peyton's real brother takes her to his base and teaches her how defend herself (one of the best scenes is when she breaks down). Finally Peyton moves on the guys win the championships. There is also a side story where Nathan gets involved with a gambler and it gets so bad that at the championship game he tells Nathan to throw the game so he can win. But he finds out from Haley after half time that they're having a son so he decides to win the game instead. After the game they're all celebrating the win...Lucas is celebrating the fact that him and Peyton are getting together...when Haley gets hit by a car that was intended for Nathan and Lucas has a heart attack because he wasn't taking his medication during the game and the shock of seeing Haley is too much for him to take. They both live and in one of the best episodes of the season Lucas sees Keith who takes him around and shows him what life would be like if he didn't do half the things that he does (once again proving that the show is really about Lucas). Things stay good for a while after that until the night before the prom when Nathan and Haley throw a party and an old sex tape that stars Nathan and Brooke is show and Peyton learns for the first time that when she was dating Nathan, Brooke slept with him. This causes Peyton to tell Brooke that they're over and they have one of the most hilarious cat fights ever. That night when Lucas comes to pick up Peyton from the prom she doesn't answer. Turns out earlier in the night she went to answer the door thinking it was Lucas and it turned out to be Stalker Derek again who ties her up and decides to have his own little prom in her basement. Brooke goes to the prom and gets pissed when she sees Lucas all alone so she goes to find Peyton and the two of them end up kicking the crap out of stalker Derek and they decide to stick together. The season keeps going with more stuff that just was thrown in there until the end when Lucas figures out, with the help of diabetic Abby, that Dan shot Keith. And when Dan is at his house dinner with Karen he pulls a gun on Dan and Karen collapses. She gets taken to the hospital and before graduation the doctors perform a c-section to save both Karen and the baby. The kids go to Graduation and Haley's water breaks during the speech. The final episode starts off with Haley giving birth and the doctors trying to revive Karen. Karen has a little Keith visit and she meets her daughter. The doctors revive her as Lucas looks on with a relieved smile on his face. Meanwhile Haley gives birth to a son who she names James Lucas Scott.  The story shifts to two weeks later when the group is saying goodbye to each other at a party thrown by Rachel. In the end they all decide to come back to the river court in 4 years.

This season had great moments. But there were some really confusing moments as well. Like the time line for Haley's pregnancy. It didn't make any season. But whatever it's tv right. Anyway this is a great season if you love one tree hill. I for one am going to have it the day it comes out. But that's because i love one tree hill. Anyway see you guys the first week of January for season 5!",1194134400,11,5050,4.25625
2763336,3,B000NA1PUG,"You can tell right from the beginning that the writers of the series did not expect to come back for a fourth season.  At the end of the third season they wrote themselves into such a corner that almost the entire first 8 episodes of this season are just repercussions of the third-season finale...

This season is definitely a departure from the ones that come before it.  While the first three seasons had a rather healthy mix of comedy and melodrama, season 4 take the melodrama into high gear and adds very little comedy to break it all up.  The season itself focuses on the groups final 6 months of high school, their final basketball games, prom, graduation, and ""the rest of their lives.""

While some plot lines are highly unrealistic and almost laughable, others are just not appropriate for 17-year-old characters, the charm of the previous seasons is still apparent in these 21 episodes.  And if for nothing else, the season does host the graduation as well as post-graduation episodes which were both pangful and worth watching.  The DVD includes two featurettes, three commentaries (eventhough the writers/crew/cast have recorded over 12 commentaries for this season on othpodcast.com), and a handful of deleted scenes.",1194134400,10,1231,5.004901960784314

After season 2,the sports took a major back seat. OTH is a soap and a great one. From the same studio that gave us old people in the 70/80s/90s Dallas and Falcon Crest, here is a running soap about the lives of the rich Scotts and their dramatic misadventures. Dan is the JR, with Karen as the stronger Pamela. Deb as the new day Sue Ellen and of course all the teens.

I have all three seasons on DVD and have watched them so much I can quote the whole eposide.  It use to be that I couldn't live without One Tree Hill.  I would either cancel all my plans so I can stay home and watch it or tape it if I have to go to work.  When I missed an eposide I use to be so upset. My favorite season would have to be season 2.  The Nathan and Haley being married and her leaving was so good that I cried when they cried and laughed when they laughed.  Season 3 was okay cause they got back together and I truely enjoyed that.  I didn't feel anything about Season 4.  I liked the fact that they added Antwon Tanner (Skills) to the credits since I always felt that he was apart of the show just like Lucas and Nathan, but I wasn't too upset when I missed an eposide.  I love the show and will be buying the DVD just like all the other loyal fans, but I do hope Season 5 have us on the edge of our seats.  I want that feeling back.  The one where it's only Thursday and I can't wait til Wednesday to see whats happening in Tree Hill.  So to all the fans, I think Mark and the other writers will do right by us and give us a season to remember, after all I do believe it may be Tree Hill's last.",1191628800,5,1390,3.8485915492957745
2763340,3,B000NA1PUG,"After watching the third season cliffhanger. Fans knew one thing was certain. Season four had the potential to be the best season of the show. Unfortunately, it only achieved that success for the first ten episodes.
Fallout Between Friends. Encounters with Dangerous Relatives. The Gambling Away of Futures. Each character was forced to grow up in a different way. The Bottom line is the first ten episodes rocked and was a great season in and of itself.

The second half however, is another story. The show struggle for a clear path and fell flat because of it. Alot of filler episodes were created that had no momentum and  almost felt like they were borrowed from a reality show script. A Prom arc was covered in four episodes with mixed results. Although it did provide a reunion for one of the show most beloved friendships. The damage was done. Tree hill twisted and stalled in a direction that only let the series show its age.. The last two episodes were the shows only redemption and sent Tree back to its roots.

If your a hardcore fan, you'll love the first ten episodes, they feel like season three. But discard the rest. Buying the set is up to you.  Hopefully year five will surprise us. See you in 08'",1191196800,7,1216,4.589861751152074
2763341,4,B000NA1PUG,"I loved One Tree Hill since the pilot when I was 14. This show has taught me a lot about morals and got me through high school. I am not a big fan of season 4 due to the lack of character interaction. Haley and Brooke (best friends) barely talked much after the beginning of the season which is odd because Brooke was Haley's maid of honor and godmother to her baby. Lucas and Peyton's relationship seemed to forced and unrealistic, and they fact they look like brother and sister made their intimate moments sickening to watch. I'm only buying it to stay loyal to the show but thats pretty much it. If the incest looking scenes weren't there I would have been alot happier with the season. Also alot of relationships were forgotten, Brook and Lucas acted if they didn't know each other, when in season 2 and 3 they were deeply in love. Nathan and Brooke have one good fun scene which is odd because before that scene they rarely talked in the show. Relationships seemed forced or non-existent.",1190592000,3,994,4.497237569060774
2763342,3,B000NA1PUG,"Before I start my review I ask that everyone (hardcore fans or haters of the show) hear me out before they click ""yes"" or ""no"" to agreeing with me below.

One Tree Hill has had a great run. Season 1 was amazing, Season 2 (while others don't like it) was still enjoyable, and Season 3 was a perfect season. Season 4 however failed miserably. Not just in my eyes, but in a lot of fans eyes as well. It seemed like the writers and actors just decided to quit right before they started filming. Some episodes were completely pointless or really didn't move the storyline on, others were just filled with horrible acting and VERY over dramatic storylines. While I don't want to call the show unrealistic (as many can relate to it) it definitely left its roots as a ""teen drama"" and went to a full on soap opera for a good chunk of the season. I will give this DVD 3 stars though, as the DVD extras seem worth the buy and the season finale is amazing and really the only thing worth watching this season for. However, if you aren't sure whether to buy it  or you aren't really into the show, I suggest just renting it or borrowing it because chances are you will be let down.

Now hardcore fans that automatically have judged my review, go ahead and click ""No"" for agreeing with me or not. See you all for Season 5. Lets hope season 5 is actually good.",1190419200,13,1346,4.291338582677166

A lot of characters didn't interact for a large portion of the season (i.e.- Lucas and Brooke), 2.) the addition of unnecessary new characters, 3.) so many bad plot lines were dragged out way too long while the good ones were either ruined by crappy writing, or cut short too soon...I could go on and on.

It had great potential as a story, and it could have progressed in a classier way, rather than dropping down to soap opera material. Obviously, the writers thought they had to include tragedy in order to keep viewers hooked, which is not the case.

Teen shows don't have to turn into dime store soap operas. Really NOT necessary. It was just sad to see this season so low in quality. Especially all the drama with Dan during the last episodes, the attack, and of course, the new girl Rachel. Can someone please tell me what purpose that character served on the show?
