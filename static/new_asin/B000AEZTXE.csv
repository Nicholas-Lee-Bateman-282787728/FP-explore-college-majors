It is time Big Pharma is held to account.  Their unbelievable hold over us has to be stopped. They are now trying to end natural madicine - no money in it for them...while they still carry on delivering over priced medicines that really don't work.",1351728000,2,347,4.40625

I guess they don't care that our rights are being threatened, and that of health freedom- We can't just sit back and let the multinational corporations and regulators inform us-YOU AND ME- of what our medical rights may be...if we don't demand medical freedom of choice we will lose it. ITs that simple. Wake up! People, listen, in this movie you will learn how bad its getting-you will hear it from Congressmen, MD's and the like- can you imagine not being able to buy vitamin c? or getting arrested for selling it?! Well a lady in France was just arrested for doing just that- watch the documentary and let your eyes be opened- you will never be the same!",1237420800,8,779,4.571428571428571

8078357,5,B000AEZTXE,"WOW! This one should be seen by everyone who is convinced that the pharmaceutical companies have only our needs in their interests. It certainly gives a jolt when thinking that popping a pill is the only way to solve our health problems. Like the auto industry in the area of transportation, the pharmaceutical companies have done their share through lobbyists to thwart the efforts of others to develop and promote alternative methods for health.",1183852800,17,447,5.054054054054054
8078358,5,B000AEZTXE,"I saw Miller's LET TRUTH BE THE BIAS back in the 90s and am awed by the way this guy produces films on shoestring budgets and in uncanny amounts of time. After LET TRUTH BE THE BIAS i was impressed, but this new film, which i heard on 'Coast-to-Coast A.M.' was produced in three months, just blew me away.

We are all living such busy lives that we don't even notice how deeply the politicos and international money machines are derailing freedoms every single day. Miller reminds us in a powerful fashion that this International cabal is forcing trade agreements upon us that are bad for EVERYBODY BUT multinational corporations. His writing, enhanced by the lovely and talented Judi Dench, is crisp and at times emotional as Miller weaves together the story of how healthcare -- and medical freedom of choice, as he calls it, is being hijacked by a group of bureaucrats serving on the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the UN, the WHO, the FDA, and other corporate charlatans.

All in all, WE BECOME SILENT is a big victory for writer/producer/director Kevin Miller. His work is so rare for a low-budget producer. He delivers a product that looks like it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars...for what was probably 0ne-tenth of the price! If you want a realistic but artistic look at the reality of pharmaceutical-based medicine, and how it is dragging us into bankruptcy, I heartily recommend WE BECOME SILENT.",1136246400,38,1412,4.854771784232365
