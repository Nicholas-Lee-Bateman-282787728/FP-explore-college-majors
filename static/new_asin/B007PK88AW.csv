5103316,5,B007PK88AW,One of the tribal councils in this Survivor is the best tribal council of all of the Survivors so far.  The whole thing is good and one of my personal favorites.  I will buy it when it becomes available.,1152230400,,203,4.17948717948718
5103317,5,B007PK88AW,"Survivor: Panama - Exile Island has surpased my expectations as, so far, being the best survivor season so far. I have never been this focused and interesting 6 episodes into a show. The last four episodes have kept surpasing each other and i have been pleasently surprised. In Australia, our current television stations have decided not to play this season, which made me having to resort to downloading the episodes. It is a shame because i believe at the end of this season, this may be regarded by many fans as the best survivor ever.

This season is truly up there with Survivor: The Australian Outback and Survivor: Pearl Islands. I have never been this exicted about a season since pearl islands and i think we are finally getting over the wickedness and overall dislike of Survivor: All-Stars. This is how survivor should be.

When this DVD box set is available to the public, i encourage all Survivorfans to purchase this item. From what has already been shown, your money will be well spent.

P.S. Please no one spoil the ending for this season on this site!",1141948800,13,1068,4.7005347593582885

5103330,3,B007PK88AW,"When this season first aired I despised it, nothing seemed to work the way I wanted it to and it felt very negative. Now that I'm much older and have viewed tons more reality tv, my reactions have changed. I was surprised to find I was enjoying the interaction between all the castaways and the slightly humorous moments even though I knew who left every episode. It honestly was fun viewing this season.

The problem I have is that, I didn't get much game from the castaways. Almost all decisions of the game were made for basic tribal interest, it wasn't untill the end strategy came into play and even then it wasn't great just worthy of some nods. The final two I feel was fairly weak in terms of game even though as characters they were fine and the jury did make the right decision of those last two. And with the last couple of episodes I did feel a negative tone but it wasn't huge.

Ultimatly not a great season but I guess now that I've seen some truely bad reality tv, I was hard on this season back in the day. I'll probubly grab this at some point.",1422144000,,1061,4.27363184079602

5103342,5,B007PK88AW,"A lot of people rag on this season for not having a great winner or not being interesting, but honestly, this was probably one of my favorite seasons of all time. Highlights include: the rivalry between Aras and Terry, an impressive Immunity Challenge winning streak, a few legitimate crazies, and a deserving winner. Oh, and what about Cirie Fields, who had one of my favorite 'Survivor' story arcs ever as she evolved from finnicky couch potato to strategic self-sufficient Survivorwoman. It seemed obvious (to me, at least) who would win between the Final Two, but the overall journey to get there was extremely engaging. Early on, there were plenty of twists and turns, with some surprising vote-offs, and the masterful endgame by the Aras-Cirie-Danielle alliance made for some amazing blindsides. Plus, as opposed to more recent seasons, this season actually focused on the survival aspect, especially early on. Definitely a recommended purchase!",1389225600,2,951,5.2631578947368425

5103344,5,B007PK88AW,"Part of the frustration of watching Survivor on TV is the 'coming up next', commercial, then repeating the 'coming up next portion' in context.  With DVDs, that is NOT included!!! So much more enjoyable to watch Survivor this way.

5103354,4,B007PK88AW,"This season is dominated by former F-14 pilot Terry who is one of the biggest immunity hogs in survivor history. He should have been in fans vs. favorites 1 or 2. This is the first installment of exile island, which was a pretty stupid idea in the first place. It's so much better now that everyone gets a chance at the hidden immunity idol instead of just the people who go to exile island. Danielle was a villain in Heroes vs. Villains and it doesn't make sense at all. She's definitely not a hero but being a villain because of this season is ridiculous. She is on that season because she's hot and has fake boobs. Cirie is a fat slob and is worthless. I can't believe Cirie has been on 3 seasons of survivor. It's amazing how one tribe is so dysfunctional and how well they do at challenges. Shane smoked 3 packs of cigarettes a day before going on survivor and goes through detox during the season. He has crazy mood swings and is one of the weirdest guys to ever play survivor.",1365206400,,983,4.318918918918919

5103366,2,B007PK88AW,"This season was fine.  I honestly didn't think it had a very likable cast (except Cirie) and there were very few shocking votes.  In fact, the only thing that saved the one tribe from being completely Pagonged was because Terry's pompous ass kept winning immunity.  I honestly started hating him because of the way he acted when he won the challenges with his ""YESYESYESYES!!!!""  Exile Island and the hidden immunity idol barely played a part except to breed major paranoia.  And Shane was incredibly annoying.  Just not one of the best, but far from one of the worst.  The one incredibly bright light was Cirie who is always a joy to watch and a very smart player.",1344556800,,665,4.632478632478633
5103367,5,B007PK88AW,I love all of the Survivor series. But why does it take so long to get more?. It seems like one series is releassed every 6 months. i would like to order more (all of the series) I love the program so much.,1344124800,,206,3.813953488372093
5103368,2,B007PK88AW,"Being a big fan of survivor, I was excited to watch a season that I had not seen before. I encountered no problems with this DVD set up until the finale episode. It skipped right through half of the finale, including the jury questions!! One of the most important moments of the season and I couldn't see it. Needless to say I wasn't too happy. The rest of the DVDs work fine, but I was pretty frustrated.",1344124800,,405,4.2727272727272725
5103369,5,B007PK88AW,"Being a fan of Survivor, I was pleased to have Survivor Panama to add to my collection. The videos were in perfect order and arrived in a timely fashion. To anyone who enjoys the program Survivor, I would recommend owning all the series that are available.  I always enjoy watching them.  Just a shame that more of the series are not yet available for purchase.",1342742400,3,361,4.538461538461538
5103370,4,B007PK88AW,I have said it before about Amazon created DVD's and this is the same. The quality in both video and audio is very good. Of course with the very latest series in HD you would expect a superior result but that is an unfair comparison. Just make sure you have a multi-region player for those of us Downunder. Data plate underneath will tell you this. Region 4 only on the plate and you will be looking at a blank screen.,1342137600,,418,4.2375
5103371,3,B007PK88AW,"I absolutely love the Survivor series so of course have no problem with the show itself.  I enjoyed watching the shows again.  My problem is with the quality and workmanship of the dvd itself.  All of the discs in the set have numerous sound issues, especially where the commercials were cut out.  In addition, several of the discs have places in them where there is an interruption or momentary pause in the playback.  Very disappointing since I own every single season of Survivor that has been released and have never had this problem before.",1341360000,,545,4.75531914893617
5103372,3,B007PK88AW,"I enjoyed this season a lot, but I was really disappointed with the video quality on the DVD! I'm sure it's not a defective DVD, it's just a bad quality transfer. The picture is fuzzy and the transitions between commercial breaks look like they were done in some back room somewhere. I have other Survivor seasons on DVD and they are not this poor. Bad job, CBS!",1340323200,,362,4.417910447761194
5103373,5,B007PK88AW,"Great!!  Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to become available, I'm so happy that Amazon allows pre-orders. I watch these shows over and over.",1340236800,,147,4.653846153846154
5103374,5,B007PK88AW,"While not one of my favorite seasons, this was still a good one. In my opinion, this is probably one of the last season before CBS got away from casting REAL people, and started to trend to casting aspiring actors/models from California, the ""pretty"" people and also recasting people who have played multiple times. One could argue that the season after this, Cook Islands was the last of its casting kind, but really, that too was cast a specific way instead of just picking the 16-20 most interesting people. I loved the way everyone interacted on all tribes. When I had originally watched, I was rooting for the Terry, Austin, Nick, Dan alliance to make it all the way. Cirie played such a good social game, and Bruce was a funny character, and was the 2nd person to be medically exited from the game. Good season, and worth it for a true Survivor fan.",1336348800,,855,4.558441558441558
5103375,5,B007PK88AW,"I've never seen this season so I can't really say how good it is but it looks pretty good. I just wish that they'd take it off preorder so I could buy it someday, keep releasing all of them",1335657600,,189,3.871794871794872
5103376,1,B007PK88AW,"I am writing from my mom's account because I am a new member of Amazon.com. I really needed to write this review. This was when 'Survivor' had GONE DOWNHILL. No wonder this was the first season to fall out the top 10 most watched TV shows of any television season. It was a disappointment from beginning to end and so was the cast. None of my family or friends liked this season either. The only three people that I actually enjoyed watching were Cirie, Melinda, and Sally. The majority of the cast is just plain UNLIKEABLE. Two examples are Aras, who is incredibly arrogant and shallow, and Shane is just plain weird. I also never understood why Danielle DiLerenzo returned for 'Heroes vs. Villains'. Not only was she unlikeable, but she also is forgettable. At least, she was put on the Villains tribe. Do not watch this season. There are much better seasons to purchase.",1334707200,,873,4.638709677419355

5103378,5,B007PK88AW,"I'm excited to see any seasons of Survivor on DVD, but this season is particularly noteworthy or giving birth to the best tribe of all time. Casaya was the perfect mix of crazy characters who managed to be hilariously dysfunctional yet so functional at the same time. Pretty much everyone was at someone else's throat at some point and there were constant meltdowns. I don't think they provided a single bad scene. Thank god they dominated over the far inferior La Mina tribe and that awful Terry didn't get his mits on the prize. Anyway, so thank you Tina, Bruce, Bobdawg, Danielle, Aras, Cirie, Courtney and Shane for constantly providing the crazy and making this season oh so watchable.

5103381,5,B007PK88AW,"The best part about the season was definitely BobDawg. That dude was the best. Totally awesome. He's good looking, brilliant, funny, and great at chopping fish. Ladies love him, kids adore him, forest animals flock to him, even when he doesn't have food to give them. If you looked up ""awesome"" in the dictionary, it would read: ""Adj. 1. awesome - inspiring awe or admiration or wonder."" If you looked up ""BobDawg"" in the dictionary, you probably wouldn't find it unless you had a damn good dictionary, but if you did find it, the entry would read ""See awesome."" Still can't believe someone that awesome got voted out so quickly. So what he drank the wine and dropped a deuce in the outhouse? That's what you're supposed to do to wine and that's where deuces are supposed to be dropped. I guess awesomeness can be a terrible burden to bear sometimes...At least he's on the cover of the DVD. That's awesome.",1333065600,7,906,4.633540372670807
5103382,4,B007PK88AW,"They are the only two seasons not available at iTunes or on DVD. The fanbase needs to have all seasons at their disposal. Besides, it's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. After Marquesas which had a lot of likable people and power shifts, a season with not many likeable people may not be as popular but as far as strategy goes, Brian was excellent at executing it. Plus Thailand is beautiful.",1309305600,,406,4.426666666666667
5103383,4,B007PK88AW,"This season is worthwhile because it has one of the most dominating players of all time, if not THE most dominating. The winner of this season was nearly sociopathic in his manipulation of people and his performance deserves to be reviewed. A ""Survivor Hall of Fame"" has been created on one of the main recapping sites and this winner, who should have been an inaugural inductee, was left out because this season has been almost wiped from existence. It remains one of two seasons (Amazon being the other) that is not available in ANY format so it deserves to reintroduced to the fan base.",1300752000,,589,4.673076923076923
5103384,5,B007PK88AW,"Many Survivor fans consider this season to be one of the worse ones, and I can see why. Coming after Marquesas with the big alliance power shift it was a little predictable towards the end. Couple that with quite a handful of unlikeable characters and you have a pretty unpopular season. Even I wasn't a big fan of it when I first watched it.

However, all things considered and after years I feel this season has aged well. With many recent seasons having pretty poor editing compared to the older seasons, this stands up as one of the best for story and character development. Pretty much everyone is developed as a character which never happens on Survivor these days (but should). Plus it has bucket loads of great and hilarious moments.

Thailand may be remembered as a ""bad"" season of Survivor by many, but the fact it's so requested by fans to be released on DVD shows just how loyal Survivor's fanbase is. Hopefully this gets the release it deserves soon and Thailand gains a new wave of fans who realise it's not actually that bad at all.",1300406400,,1047,4.5638297872340425

Good challenges and loads of fun off memory long time ago now since I've seen this one but I remember bits and pieces. What I do remember is survivor thailand for me was really fun to watch because of the people involved. Please release this one I'm desprit to have this one in my collection as well as any another that gets released on dvd thank you bye...,1287964800,,621,4.408695652173913
5103388,5,B007PK88AW,"I love EVERY SINGLE SEASON of SURVIVOR! I wish, pray and hope that they will release Survivor Thailand and Amazon on DVD followed by Season 11-present. Survivor is one of the best shows on TV and it would be amazing to be able to have it on DVD forever :)

CBS/AMAZON Thank you so much for releasing Survivor Marquesas and Africa, I have already watched both seasons and they were better than I remembered :)",1287360000,2,408,4.44
5103389,5,B007PK88AW,Now that we finally have a high quality set for Africa and Marquesas please tell me that this and Amazon will be next!  Seasons 1 to 10 all on DVD??  Did we ever think we'd see the day??!!,1286409600,2,188,3.9210526315789473
5103390,5,B007PK88AW,"Despite poor reception by certain people, any true Survivor fan loves this season as much as any others.  There were arguably as many if not more interesting personalities this season than any season ever (not counting all stars, heroes vs villains etc). From NYC cop Ken, to the shii-devil Shii-Ann, Brian, Robb Z, the STUNNING Erin, backstabbing Penny, the Ted and Ghandia conflict, and so much more. Robb Z choking whiney bigot Clay was one of the funniest moments in Survivor history.  Watching Robb mature as the season went on was a special moment.

But what do people most think of? The winners. And in my opinion, say what you want about the trashy, dog killing used-car salesman's personal life, i really don't care. The show is what interests me, and Brian Heidik is arguably one of the greatest survivor strategists ever.  His brash, cocky commentaries and interviews away from the tribe are hysterical, calculating, careful, and genius.  You see the careful manipulation of everyone, telling them what they need to hear, sending home whomever he chose to or needed to.

This guy should have been on All-Stars, heroes vs villains, something, as he was one of the greatest villains ever.  Bummer he's so greedy, as i read he demanded a huge sum of guaranteed money (10k?) no matter what he would've placed on All-Stars. Tsk.  Trust me, this season needs to be released on some high quality DVD's , so us true survivor fans can rewatch all its amazing moments.",1286323200,2,1469,4.824701195219124
5103391,5,B007PK88AW,"Set in one of the most beautiful island locations, Survivor Thailand was essentially a battle between the old and the young. Since the older group ultimately prevailed, it wasn't greatly accepted by the generally younger skewing viewing audience of the show. That being said, the way this game was run by the ultimate winner was simply masterful. There was an exciting twist in this season and plenty of memorable moments. I can't wait to have it on DVD!",1280534400,,454,4.833333333333333
5103392,5,B007PK88AW,"I just wish that CBS would release all the seasons of Survivor on DVD.  So many of us fans would much rather buy a decent copy of the show than try to record our own (Australian networks are so slack about screening the show in a regular time slot its impossible to not miss half the episodes when they eventually air) Trying to download from the internet is impossible for those who are not computer savvy - just let me buy my DVD's from a shop.  The seasons that were realeased already were not released outside of the US, which means that ordering them from stores like Amazon is a fans only hope of buying them.  If the boxed sets were avail in store outside of North America the production company could have sold many more copies.  I would happily purchase today every season boxed set on DVD if they were available, but instead I am left hoping that one day CBS will release ALL seasons one day soon.",1236470400,,907,4.349112426035503

5103397,5,B007PK88AW,"Not the best of the survivor series but still a good one. The setup was OK but something with the surroundings and atmosphere was slightly less intruiging as the earlier ones. I will buy it as soon as it becomes available as any true ""collector"" would.",1162252800,6,252,4.5
5103398,5,B007PK88AW,Without a doubt Survivor Exile Island was the best season produced by Burnett and Co. It had so many twists and shocking tribal councils. I won't mention any names so as not to spoil it for you but the from the merge onwards it is unbelieveably addictive! Even before the merge it is exciting and you find yourself counting down the time until the next episode. I would without a second thought recommend this season as a must buy. Any true survivor fan will LOVE it and for those who aren't survivor fans prepare to be hooked!!! You've been warned!!!!!,1154649600,6,553,4.54
5103399,5,B007PK88AW,"Out of all the Survivor seasons, I feel this is easily the most underrated.  It starts a little slow (the first four episodes are basically worthless) but man it starts to come alive in the second half.  Even if you didn't like this season the first time around, try rewatching the DVD and I guarantee you will enjoy it.  It's one of my all time favorite Survivor seasons.",1153008000,,372,4.4411764705882355
