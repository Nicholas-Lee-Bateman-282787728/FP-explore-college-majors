8731961,5,B014VHBOSY,"Director Manfred Kirchheimer calls his 45-minute film ""lyrical documentary"" & I can't think of a better description. A beautifully composed montage of flowing scenes, the film follows the graffiti-emblazoned elevated trains of NYC in 1977, contrasting their vital, vivid images with those of slick but soulless commercial billboards, interspersed with vastly different portions of the city itself. Set to the subtle, sometimes energetic music of Charles Mingus, the film reveals landscapes that might be post-war ruins, yet are still strangely beautiful; pensive, weary figures pausing on the streets, and seemingly lost souls glimpsed through the passing windows of the trains; lingering shots of the most mundane objects that become works of abstract art over time. It captures not only the look of a now-past period of time in NYC, it captures the emotional tone & soul of that time as well.

The 2-DVD set includes several informative extras, such as an interview with the director, outtakes & extra footage, appearances by some of the graffiti artists, and 4 previous short films by Kirchheimer as well. These are:

Colossus on the River (15 minutes) - Following the docking procedure for a large ocean liner, it finds drama & beauty in a process we probably never thought about before.

Claw (30 minutes) - ""A Fable"" examining the difference between the natural world & the world of art on one hand, and the notion of ""progress"" on the other, as old buildings with character & personality are torn down to make way for huge, faceless boxes of steel & glass.

Short Circuit (45 minutes) - A mixture of fiction documentary that slowly unpeels the hidden fears of a white liberal New Yorker in the early 1970s, and his realization that for all his good intentions, he understands little of the black lives running parallel to his own.

Bridge High (10 minutes) - Following a short trip across a bridge (actually using 3 different bridges for their various physical beauties), as a car makes the transition from country to city.

These 4 films shows Kirchheimer's growth & worldview as a director, and are a marvelous addition to the main feature, especially with his comments on the making of each one. But if the main feature were the only thing on this DVD, it would still be well worth viewing many times. As the previous reviewer notes, it has a meditative quality that carries the viewer along without ever becoming soporific. Every image evokes feeling & thought, almost as if the viewer were from another time (as Kirchheimer himself states), gazing in bewildered wonder at another world. It's a film I'll return to many times to come -- most highly recommended!",1456617600,7,2672,4.979820627802691
8731962,5,B014VHBOSY,"This short documentary contains some really beautiful richly colorful photography of the elevated subways and the neighborhoods around them circa 1980.  It's filled with impressionistic scenes of subway cars, passengers and track workers, junkyards, neighborhood kids, billboards - scenes of everyday life.  Interludes of Mingus drift in and out along with background subway announcements and ambient noise and conversation.  No narrative, no message.  A beautiful film.",1455753600,4,470,6.075757575757576
