4904938,5,B005Y5NJ54,"You'll need a region-free code-free DVD player with a built-in PAL converter to play this in the US.  (These can be found fairly easily and relatively inexpensively online, by the way.)  Fine transfers and sound.  Why these have never been released domestically I never will understand.  Subtitles can be eliminated by scrolling through the four languages until the 'none' option is available.  Well worth it if you enjoyed the series.

Fine US seller and shipping, by the way.  The only other alternatives are to try to order from Europe (which will be much more expensive).  I don't believe season 6 has been released anywhere else.",1329177600,2,634,4.9714285714285715

8489100,4,B005Y5NJ54,"Since I submitted this review, Madman of Australia has completed its ""McCloud"" series. The following is my original review, revised to conform with the latest developments:

I'm one of the biggest fans ever of this series which combines crime drama with country vs. city humor. Although Universal released seasons one and two in 2005, US fans have been waiting forever for the other five seasons. At last, things have changed, but Universal inexplicably seems interested only in releasing the series in foreign countries. Two such have turned up, the present one from NORDISK, and the other from MadMan, an Australian company dedicated to anime and classic TV series. It took Madman over two years to release the last two seasons, and I finally got tired of ""waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" and bought these NORDISK DVD's. I'm not sorry I did (they were a welcome stopgap for two years), but I bought MadMan's seasons 6 and 7 when they came out in summer 2013. The MadMan series is not(yet)available from AMAZON, but it's easy to order from them--my copies arrived the day BEFORE the release dates!

If one speaks Danish, Finnish, Swedish or Norwegian, NORDISK will, of course, be the version of choice. Whether one buys NORDISK or MadMan, US purchasers will need to get a ""multi-region"" player that can convert PAL format to NTSC (NORDISK's DVD's are region 2, MadMan's are region 4). Such players are easy to find, although it's something of a hit-or-miss process to get one that actually plays all regions--my experience has been that 2 out of 3 units have been OK. The Scandinavian subtitles are easily removable with the ""subtitle"" switch on the player's remote control, and the original English soundtrack is untouched. MadMan has no subtitles.

Still, my first recommendation for English-speaking viewers is MadMan, which seems to be taking greater care with the series. Even for those not fluent in English, I would recommend at least getting Madman's seasons one and three.

NORDISK's series is flawed. I'm not talking about the images and the sound, which are, for the most part, just fine. There are some momentary dropouts in both season six and seven, but the same dropouts occur in the Madman DVD's, so these must exist in the original materials. However, unless the Scandinavian subtitles are an absolute must, I'd recommend the Madman series for the following reasons:

MOST IMPORTANTLY, MadMan's season one offers what is, as of this date (7/25/2013), the ONLY way to see the ORIGINAL SIX one-hour episodes as they were shown before they were combined into three 1-hour episodes for syndication. (It looks like NORDISK's seasons one and two are currently OOP, but inspection of ads for still-available copies on the internet show that they did not have the original version of season one.) Seeing the uncut originals contributes mightily to the viewer's comprehension of certain plot points. For example, in ""Horse Stealing on 5th Avenue"" we FINALLY get the really funny ""Lady Godiva"" segment that explains the title. In the syndicated version, this is completely cut. MadMan's season one ALSO includes the syndicated versions (which are slightly different), PLUS the pilot, an illustrated episode guide, and an essay on the series by Grant Taylor. MadMan's season two includes the NBC Mystery Movie opening titles.

MadMan's season three includes a video interview with executive producer Glen A. Larson. Unfortunately, in the first episode, ""The New Mexican Connection,"" MadMan was forced to remove the snippets of songs by Ricky Nelson. This is not MadMan's fault--it appears that the Nelson estate, even at this far remove, believes he is still such a hot property that it denied copyright clearance(?!). For cryin' out loud, we're not talking about complete songs--just, at the most, one-minute clips, mostly played UNDER dialogue! MadMan has cleverly gotten around this by skillfully substituting other music where music only is involved. Unfortunately, the longest clip underscores a short bit of important dialogue--this is totally cut. However, this is better than NORDISK's solution--IT SIMPLY OMITS THE EPISODE ALTOGETHER. NORDISK's season six and seven DO have all the episodes, and season seven includes the ""sequel,"" ""The Return of Sam McCloud"" (as does Madman).

I can't speak about the other NORDISK seasons, but since they managed to cram season five onto three discs, whereas MadMan took five, I was worried that at least some of the NORDISK DVD's would be double-sided. I am happy to report that at least in seasons six and seven the NORDISK discs are single-sided. Unfortunately, NORDISK places the episodes on the DVD's wildly out of order--MadMan is scrupulous about correct order.

In short, unless Scandinavian subtitles are really important to one, I'd recommend getting the MadMan series, if only to get the original season one, and at least MOST of ""The New Mexican Connection""--there yuh go!",1332028800,2,4941,5.13681592039801
