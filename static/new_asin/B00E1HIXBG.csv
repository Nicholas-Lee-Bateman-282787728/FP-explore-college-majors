8600066,5,B00E1HIXBG,"Maybe God does not play dice with the universe. However Catherine's uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) does. And the results are hilarious. Usually in a movie like this, the three collages of Einstein would just be fillers or comic relief. However in ""I.Q."" they are not only an interracial part of the movie, but are fun to be with on their own. ""Watch out for gravity, it's a killer""
----------------------
Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is an auto mechanic with a natural knack for special puzzles. He also reads popular science while assembling vehicles. One day a car pulls in for repair. The passenger is Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Their eyes meet and he immediately knows he will marry her. Little did he know who her uncle was or that he would go to such elaborate extent to woo her.
---------------------

You can guess the outcome before the movie starts. The fun is in seeing how they get there. And how do you outwit ""The Rat Man?""",1496102400,,942,4.674698795180723
8600067,5,B00E1HIXBG,This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I love learning about Einstein and the relativity of our emotions and physics and his close thinking friends - who could also play.,1491091200,,179,4.424242424242424

8600074,4,B00E1HIXBG,"This movie is thoroughly enjoyable. I saw it in theatre as a boy and now showing it to my girlfriend and daughter was a delight. They enjoyed it as well. If you like a good romantic comedy that's not focused on a ""chick-flick"" appeal then add this to your collection. And the packaging and delivery was satisfactory. Thank you Amazon.",1450137600,,334,4.583333333333333
