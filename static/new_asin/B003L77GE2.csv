4137833,5,B003L77GE2,"The snakejuice episode is my favorite. I laughed out loud like thirty times! Ron Swanson is hilarious in it. Leslie and Ann are drunk fighting and it is hilarious. Also the ""dinner party"" episode and the blossoming romance between Leslie and Ben. Probably the best season yet!",1313884800,3,276,4.8936170212765955
4137834,5,B003L77GE2,"this is how you create a classic, clever comedy tv series. michael schurr and greg daniels had already done it with the office and got that show off and running but after they left (around season 5?) their new tv project ""parks and recreation"" started the same way the office had. . .a little rough and rocky with low ratings at the beginning and seemed somewhat of a carbon copy of the office. however, when a tv show has smart humor, excellent writing and loveable/unique/warm characters with depth, the show is going to get a cult following and continue to grow and become beloved. this season also did a great job of separating itself from the office while still obviously borrowing the humor.

parks and recreation is unique in where most tv shows fail. either a show will go for cheap laughs and the raunchy sex humor like two and a half men or a show can stay classy and sophisticated and have character development and continous running stories between characters that arch over the entire season and you feel a real connection with the people and their situations...or you have the 30 minute sitcom where each episode basically starts from a clean slate which disables you from truly getting to know or connect to a character. fortunately, parks and rec picks the high road and stays classy while building on back stories and being absolutely hilarious.

while i was sad to see mark brandaniwitz (paul schneider) character go last season, the addition of ben (adam scott) and chris (rob lowe) has been HUGE. i think they add alot to the show and i think rob lowe's health-freak of a character ""chris"" is just absolutely hilarious and adam scott's ""ben"" is awkwardly great and warm and those two characters add alot of laughs and quirkiness to an already great ensemble/cast.  i also like how leslie has came into her own in the season, she has gained more confidence and seems to be wiser than her oblivious nature in the first few seasons (good move to differentiate her from michael scott on the writers part). i also enjoyed the progression of rashida jones character ""ann"" in the season, she was always the ""stickler"" and uptight nurse in previous seasons, but in this season she lets loose and starts enjoying herself more and exploring the ""ann"" character.

once again, character development is so essential to this shows success and this season continued that. i also love the unorthodox marriage and relationship of andy and april. puts a very modern twist on marriage however i did feel the ceremony was kind of disrespectful to the idea of a real marriage in general but it ended up being sweet and charming like the show is known for so that was a minor detail for me. very similiar to how pam and jim were the sails for the ship on the office in its first 4 seasons, andy and april are that for parks and rec, just in an even more unconventional way.

i honestly cannot wait to get my hands on season 3 on dvd so i can watch all of these brilliant episodes again. like the office was in seasons 1-5, the show just continues to get better and i cannot wait to see what is in store for season 4.

brilliant show!",1310774400,16,3131,4.582142857142857
4137835,5,B003L77GE2,I rarely laugh out loud when I watch sitcoms on TV. The characters in this show are all so good. I love this show! I am so happy it survived three seasons (thus far).,1310169600,,166,3.911764705882353
4137836,5,B003L77GE2,"Just a brief review: this show is awesome, and it gets better with every season! (meaning season 3 is the best yet) It is definitely worth the price to buy this, you will not be disappointed. Best show on TV in my opinion. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1309996800,2,239,4.333333333333333
4137837,5,B003L77GE2,"After a slow start, Parks and Recreation became one of the best shows on TV with its second season. Now, its 3rd season (while sadly shortened) is 16 episodes of hilarity and off-the-wall surrealism. At first constantly compared to its spiritual successor The Office, I personally feel that it has surpassed its heights. I would name the high points of the season, but all the episodes and characters are so good, it's hard for me to single any out (Ron Swanson, the meat-loving, ultra-libertarian curmudgeon excepting).

I can't think of anything much to say further, except that
1. Parks and Recreation is great, and you should watch it.
2. Etc.

Grade: 5/5",1308787200,4,659,4.875
4137838,5,B003L77GE2,"This show just continues to get better and better!  Season 3 has been absolutely flawless!  Every cast member is loveable and hilarious, and the writing is brilliant.  Even the recurring characters and guest stars are consistently funny, such as Orin, Jean-Ralphio, and Tammy 2.  This show always leaves me with the biggest smile on my face.  If you gave up on it early on, I strongly suggest you give it another try!",1308441600,,417,4.736111111111111
4137839,5,B003L77GE2,"**May Contain Spoilers**

Parks and Recreation's winning streak continues...still the best show on TV right now. So many new developments. So many new classic episodes/moments. So much is right with this show that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's see we've got the successful intergration of Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott). Speaking of...there's another adorable relationship unfolding between Ben and Leslie. But my favorite as far as couples go is still April and Andy.  And if not for NBC's flub of accidentally promoting April and Andy's awesome sauce wedding they would have taken everyone by surprise with probably the most charming TV wedding I have ever seen. And what really is amazing is that they are more loveable/ interesting to watch as a married couple. From them being horrible housekeepers, to them eating turkey chili with a shared plastic fork off of a frisbee, to their role playing and contests of seeing who can get the most money from people at the Snakehole Lounge...there are so many things that have been funny, sweet and original about them.

But there have been great moments with the other major characters as well: Ann and Leslie anger dancing in ""The Fight"". Ron swiveling his chair around his circular desk in a vain effort to avoid citizens in ""The Bubble"". The Return of Tammy 2. The Return of Jean-Ralphio. The Return of Detlef Schrempf. Tom seemingly becoming a budding mogul with Jean-Ralphio (their company's name is Entertainment 720). Which I hope means that we get to see more of Jean-Ralphio (""Flushed with Cash""). The ecstasy that was ""5000 Candles In The Wind"", and the potential agony that is Tammy 1 (Just the mention of her made Tammy 2 run for cover). And what's gonna happen with Leslie? Will she run for and/or become Mayor? Will she and Ben go public with their relationship? And after Ann being a party girl most of the season is she going to continue to ride the wildside with Donna or was that a gleam in Chris' eye and what does that mean to Ann? And will Jerry ever be recognized as the great artist he is by the rest of the Parks department? (""Shut up Jerry"") I guess we'll just have to find out next season...

For the uninitiated you'll have to forgive me if my review seemed to be relevant to only those who have been watching the show. To you, I say you have all summer to catch up and see why most people think this show is great. I think I read somewhere that P&R is going into syndication so that gives you another way to check it out...just remember that while the first season (the first 6 episodes) isn't awful things don't really get cooking until the 2nd season.",1306454400,47,2659,4.639065817409766

4138405,5,B003L77GE2,"NOW P&R is closely related to The Office. I am a HUGE Office fan and someone had told me to watch P&R, so I gave season 1 a try. The camera angles reminded me of The Office easily, but the acting was just not there yet. I honestly skipped season 2 because I heard that season 3 nailed it--and they sure did! I was completely familiar with the comedic humor from season 3. Every other sentence was a joke or something slightly crude, which was totally needed! I enjoy that the focus is on little town politics and how the smaller differences are truly memorable. Season 1 introduced Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy, Jurassic World) who eventually grew into the character people are dying to see. This is a grand show that shows much growth (as every show should). I feel as if the entirety of season 1 was a pilot, and season 3 is on it's own level. The semi-dark humor is memorable and can easily bring a smile to your face after a LONG day; trust me--this show is needed! I am thankful that Prime offers this, I feel soon they will beat out Netflix at their own game! P&R is enjoyable, cleaner than The Office regarding humor and has a pretty good moral purpose--local political differences can be made by people like you. Amy Poehler has produced many of the shows and I just want to say thank you for that! Production needs to be acknowledged!",1439856000,,1351,4.408

It's very funny, of course, but its greatness lies in its message...that change can happen when a group of good people make progress in small increments. It manages to be optimistic and hopeful without being sentimental.

A word of warning...the first six episodes of the series are odd. They're worth watching so that characters and situation are familiar, but the series took a completely different direction after the initial misstep. The intent had been to create something similar to The Office, but the cynicism wasn't working so they changed the focus.

Was it a funny satire on government bureaucracy with its incompetence and overreach, or was it a self-righteous lecture on the stupidity of a public that can't appreciate that leftist Leslie and her zany crew of bureaucrats just want to do the right thing but are thwarted by evil capitalist corporations  who manipulate and distract the infant-like population with candy and treats?

Certainly towards the end there was no doubting the writers contempt for the public who ""hate science and facts"" and season 6 is pretty much unwatchable. When the show isn't agenda driven it can be funny and there are a couple of gems tucked in there. It's a shame the writers didn't have the depth or intellectual awareness to flesh out more of the inherent conflict between social agendas and the pragmatism of governing.  On the episodes that they did manage to do that the show could be quite good but too often the writers completely sacrificed humor for cheap, lazy political shots.",1425600000,2,1121,4.651515151515151

Ron never ceases to make me smile - and yet still surprises me sometimes (spoiler alert!) like when we finally meet his first wife and she ends up turning him into a little school boy over night.  At first I wasn't sure how I felt about Ben, but his character has definitely grown on me - an excellent match for Leslie's personality.

The writers love their characters and the characters are kind and caring people. Even Ron Swanson, or should I say ESPECIALLY Ron Swanson.

It might not be to everyone's taste in comedy...it's laughs are not as obvious as, say, Family Guy, but if you like a slightly more understated style (but no less hilarious), then check this one out.  This is a show you have to really watch - you can't ""watch"" it while doing other tasks, if you just have this on in the background, you'll miss the hilarity.  In case you've not seen this before, if you watch just a single episode, you may not ""get it"" at first, but watch a few and you'll be hooked.  I love Season 3, but recommend starting with Season 1 Episode 1.  Watch the show and you'll see how it very funny and yet subtle it is.",1360454400,,695,4.195488721804511

4144475,5,B003L77GE2,"Parks & Recreation started off pretty mediocre, but it got really great really fast, pretty much right when season two started.  But in the last couple episodes of season two, a couple new, wonderful characters show up, played by the hilarious Adam Scott and Rob Lowe (although, for what it's worth, Paul Schneider's character Mark Brendanawicz quits his job and leaves the series, and has never returned since).  In season three, their characters (Ben and Chris, respectively) become regular cast members, and the two -- Ben, especially -- really add a lot to the show's story and comedic potential.  Meanwhile, April and Andy's story arc continues, and continues to be a riot, and Ron Swanson continues to be Ron Swanson.  And so on, and so on.  Bottom line, this is a brilliant comedy, and it'll make you laugh a lot.

SPECIAL FEATURES: Like season two, these discs contain a lot of great features, including a great amount of deleted scenes (15-20 minutes' worth on each disc), a hilarious 20+-minute gag reel, a few commentaries (four or five of them, I think), and a couple very funny promotional sketches with the actors ""out of character.""",1359936000,,1147,4.88659793814433

4144482,5,B003L77GE2,"Parks and Rec is currently the funniest show on TV. The cast is superb and their chemistry and comedic timing keeps getting better and better. By season 3, Ron Swanson has become a cultural phenomenon. (""I like fishing. It's like yoga, but I still get to kill something."") The tale of Leslie and Ben is an epic romance that you'll have no choice but to root for. Of course, who could forget the flu outbreak, the Harvest Festival, and the surprise wedding? All in the genius that is Parks season 3.

Once you start watching Pawnee, you never really leave. You begin to care about Leslie and all of her friends. She truly loves this town, love her job, and lvoes the waffles. So, if you want to watch the funniest, smartest, and most heart-warming show on TV right now, look no further. There are no sitcoms that are better that are currently on the air. Watch Season 3 and you'll see why.

4144575,3,B003L77GE2,"Ever since the British ""The Office"" revolutionized the mockumentary sitcom style, it seems every other show tried to imitate it, but with different levels of success.  The best one is ""Modern Family"". ""Parks and Recreation"", on the other hand, is like an awkward sibling of ""The Office"". It's inevitable that people will compare them. The premises are similar: the office woking setting, the quirky characters, the knowing looks.  It gives you the feeling of ""been there, done that"".

The first two seasons are good because there was a good plot for the characters to pursue. So I would rate them with 4 stars.  However in season 3, with the introductions of Rob Lowe character, unnecessary IMHO, and a new love interest for Leslie Knope, Ben, the story lines go nowhere. The Indian guy who seemed fresh in the first season, gets to be insufferable by season 3: loud mouth and flashy without substance. The boss, who looks grumpy all the time but has a kind heart, is loved by many viewers but actually does not have much acting to do.  The temp girl overdid the knowing looks.  Of all the supporting characters, only Andy shows any real human traits and is actually funny.

Amy Poehler did a good job as a competent public worker and the glue that hold everything together. But the show writers should go for some goals each season just as they did the first two seasons.  That way the story line will stay focus and not veering into unfunny subplots.

4144639,4,B003L77GE2,"My husband & I have all three seasons of Parks & Recreation. This show has comedic scripts & an interesting cast. Equally as interesting are the complex relationships between the characters. The main character of this show is an optimistic & naive deputy director for the parks department of Pawnee, Indiana (played by Amy Poehler). She and all of her very unique supporting cast members always seem to be getting in and out of the most ironic situations.
Whether you'd like to start at the beginning of the show or delve right into Season 3, if you're a fan of the mockumentary cinema, this show is for you.",1318118400,,608,4.638888888888889

4144641,4,B003L77GE2,"Parks and Recreation received its first Emmy nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series this year, and if you've been watching the show Thursday nights on NBC, it's easy to see why. But if for some reason you haven't now is the perfect opportunity to catch yourselves up by picking up the newly released third season on DVD.

Parks and Recreation, which is shot in a mocumentary style, follows Deputy Leslie Knope, played by the hilarious Amy Poehler, a mid-level bureaucrat working in the Pawnee, Indiana Parks and Recreation Department.  In season one, we find Leslie on a quest to build a park for her city, but she runs into many obstacles along the way and hilarity ensues. Though the show's main focus is Leslie, Parks and Recreation would not be the same without its outstanding cast of supporting characters. Leslie's boss, Ron Swanson, played by the brilliant Nick Offerman, is a mustachioed, meat-eating libertarian who despises his job almost as much as his two ex-wives, both named Tammy - one of which we meet in second season. April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) is Ron's unruly assistant whose pessimism and inability to care about doing her job correctly is perfect for Ron's aversion to taking calls and meetings with other local government officials or citizens of Pawnee. Ann Perkins, played by the beautiful and charming Rashida Jones, is Leslie's best friend and confidant. Though Ann is a nurse at the Pawnee Hospital during season one and season two, she comes to work with Leslie at the Parks Department in season three which causes a little bit of friction between the two in episode 13 called ""The Fight."" The other cast of characters includes Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt, a new member of the Parks Department who Leslie hates at first but soon develops a different opinion, Chris Pratt as the dense but loveable Andy Dwyer, and Rob Lowe as the Indiana State Auditor Chris Traeger.

The Parks and Recreation Season 3 DVD set is comprised of three discs, all of which have bonus features. The first disc contains the first six episodes along with deleted scenes, a hilarious trailer commercial for ""Ron & Tammy 2,"" the episode where Ron's ex-wife Tammy returns for a second time, as well as commentaries by Adam Scott, Amy Poehler and Michael Schur (the show's creator) for ""Flu Season"" and Nick Offerman, Meghan Mullaly, and Jim O'Heir for ""Ron & Tammy 2."" But the best bonus feature on disc one is the hilarious 20-minute gag reel that shows just how wonderful the dynamic is between the members of the cast. Discs two and three contain more deleted scenes, commentaries, and promos.

Parks and Recreation started out with dismal ratings. It was often compared to The Office, 1) because it was advertised as being from the creators of The Office, 2) because of its mocumentary style which became synonymous with The Office, and 3) it had a leading character that seemed to be just as nave and wacky as Michael Scott, the inept and immature regional manager of the paper and printer company Dunder Mifflin Inc. However, Parks and Recreation has since completely separated itself from that association thanks to the brilliant writing of show and its characters. The character development and genuine humor are what makes Parks and Recreation truly enjoyable to watch.",1315699200,6,3279,4.902702702702703
4144642,5,B003L77GE2,people may compare this to the office and say it is just the outside version of the office but it is not. it is so much better and so much more funnier than the office. don't get me wrong i do love the office but i feel like parks is just funnier and more fun the the office. and i really do love all the awkward laughs this show gives me i just love it. simply put it is the best show on tv and nothing even compares to this show.,1315267200,8,431,3.7472527472527473
4144643,5,B003L77GE2,"After a lackluster first season, Parks & Rec really took it up a notch in season 2. Every character became a fully fleshed out person to truly appreciate, especially Leslie Knope. Season 3 however just took the greatness of season 2 and just ran with it. Everything worked. There wasn't a bad episode in the bunch. What season 3 did was cement Pawnee as the best fictional TV town this side of Springfield. The depth and background of all the supporting and minor roles breathe so much life into this ridiculous little town. Parks & Rec is the best comedy currently on the air(with Community coming in a very close second.) If you ever had any misgivings regarding this show due to season 1, ignore it and head straight to 2 & 3. They are guaranteed to change your mind. Don't forget to watch season 4, this show needs all the support it can get!",1315180800,5,846,4.464516129032258

8399456,3,B003L77GE2,"A decent season, but can feel a little too much like the Office at times. Ben Wyatt is basically Jim, giving the camera a look whenever something bizarre happens. Are we to understand that Parks and Rec is basically the same formula as the Office in that a camera crew is following around these city employees for a documentary?  I enjoy seeing Chris Pratt's character continue to develop, as he pretty much steals every scene he's in, but his hilarity is just dimmed by April, who's really basically just an irritating brat. Jerry is just there to get picked on, far too often unfairly. I guess it's just hit or miss for me.",1501891200,,625,4.530973451327434
