8272509,5,B00198L9FM,"I can't rave enough about this DVD.  From its representation of the book ""Follow the Drinking Gourd,"" to Sweet Honey in the Rock singing freedom songs, this is top-notch from start to finish.  It goes into the details of slavery seriously, yet in an easy-to-understand way.  I've never seen a better show for children on what slavery was like.  And, throughout, it emphasizes the importance of music in the lives of slaves.  Just fabulous!",1368144000,2,439,4.878378378378378
