7988828,5,B000093NPM,"Saiyuki is a retelling in modern garb (if a dragon/jeep and beer can toting demons can be considered modern) of an old Chinese legendary tale - Journey to the West, originally set down in the 16th Century.  Faced with the loss of a manuscript of great magical significance Sanzo, a priest , is dispatched along with three companions.  As told here his companions are three demons - Goku the Monkey King, Gojyo the water sprite, and Hakkai a human turned demon when he slaughtered a thousand demons in revenge.
The four reel from one hair-raising adventure to another as they head for the final confrontation.  Arguing, brawling and womanizing in between the heroics.  As I've noted elsewhere this is an essentially masculine story, with women playing what is so far a very secondary role.  This is a different spin than usual for this kind of anime, and it is surprisingly successful.
In these episodes each of the demons faces their own personal demons - Hakkai's grief over the loss of his beautiful wife, Goku's need for someone he can trust, and Gojyo's surprising soft spot.  Sanzo is the wise man and healer in this group of stories, although sometimes his advice is every bit as harsh as the problem it solves.
Dialog is what really makes this series work.  Not that there is anything to slight in the story or the artwork, but the snappy give and take of this modern gang-on-a-mission is what carries the day.  In addition, the episodes refuse to become yet another tale of finding and destroying evil in the goriest fashion possible.  Instead, they demonstrate instead a surprising amount of literary merit.",1063497600,10,1616,4.805054151624549
