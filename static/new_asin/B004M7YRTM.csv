4428897,1,B004M7YRTM,"Overly long and dull.

Sort of like a haunted version of ""Groundhog Day"" on a boat.

The plot was a good idea, but it was so slow and dull. The actors were pretty good, but with a slow story linbe, they didn't bring too much life to the confusing script.",1428796800,,254,4.06

4428899,4,B004M7YRTM,Was not sure if I would like it. After watching I enjoyed it. Nice to see a good actress expand her depth.,1394496000,,106,3.8636363636363638
4428900,2,B004M7YRTM,"Paula (Rene O'Connor) is an inspector for a historical society, looking for sites to preserve. She visits an old ship and parks her car under the proverbial suspended piano with expected results. Fortunately only the car is hurt as she meets the very personable Vigs (Larry Joe Campbell) perhaps the best reason to watch the film.

As her car cannot be driven, Paula opts to spend the night on the large ship. Weird things start to happen. Is it the eels? The food? The residual antifreeze in the water? As she sleeps she wakes up then something weirder happens, but it is only a dream. This goes on constantly until the point of viewer frustration.

Things are cleared up at the end, although they don't spell it out for you. Not really a horror film. Available on a 30 Horror Film collection.

4428901,1,B004M7YRTM,"Really an amateur effort - the actors did the best they could, but the material is just so pedestrian and happenstance.  Give it a pass.",1384560000,2,136,4.44
4428902,4,B004M7YRTM,"An inspector for the Historic Trust visits an abandoned ship on a desolate waterfront. Paula meets up with the self-apppointed caretaker Vigs who blindly made the application for historical status. Moments after her arrival, Paula's car is completely demolished when a piano falls on it. She is far from town and is stuck for the night. Without any particular option, Paula accepts Vigs offer to spend the night there on the once proud steamship. What follows is a sleepless night of bad dreams and creepy reality.

I'll admit, Renee O Connor & Larry Joe Campbell do a wonderful job acting in this film. From the very beginning all the way to the end, I watched soley on their performances alone. However, while I liked the film, I was confused with what the film was trying to get across to me. This woman is stuck on this steamship yet she keeps reliving/dreaming(?) her night over and over with little variations each time...wha'?  If this were a film about a haunted ship, I could totally get the gist but this just made little to no sense to me at all. Other than that, Deadrise is a wonderful, delightfully creepy film.",1384214400,,1125,4.6767676767676765
4428903,4,B004M7YRTM,"Good acting but a little too confusing a script. The viewer could have been given a bit more information in the beginning or shortly thereafter as to how to interpret what follows. What follows in the movie is highly reminiscent of the movie ""Triangle"" where a scene (or some close proximity thereof) gets repeated over and over again.

So, in this story this women drives to an old ship that's in a strange environment with a strange caretaker so that she can decide if it qualifies for being registered as an historical site but then her car is bizarrely squashed. She ends up staying over night at the ship but keeps waking up and you keep waiting for something bad to happen to her or for her to do the logical thing and simply run away which, of course, she doesn't do.

The problem is you don't know if she's just waking up frequently or if she's dreaming the whole thing either multiple times or dreams within a dream or that she's dead and something else is going on or that the ship has an agenda of it's own and we are seeing an altered state of existence. Supposedly there are clues but you have to watch more than once which, if you have a life, is a bit too redundant. If you don't want my clue then don't read further.

The main clue to me is in her eating a dinner that doesn't agree with her and then going into her hotel room seeing some scenes on the tele that relate to what happens later and then eventually to sleep. But then, too, the last scene in the movie is of a squashed car with dust blowing off as if it's happening all over again with the additional alternate possibility that there's a not-so-alive person inside. The counter argument to the dreams interpretation is that dreams don't work that way, they just don't occur in multiple sequences in one night. Then there is the title which doesn't really fit any interpretation very well except, remotely, to where she died in her car and ...",1317254400,4,1921,4.405633802816902
8435643,4,B004M7YRTM,I believe Renee O'Connor did the best she could with a somewhat lax script and low budget.  I know she is a very capable and talented actress and I'm looking to watch all of her movies.  I would have liked to heard Paula have some self conversations as to why she could not get out of her nightmares.  I highly recommend her movies Beyond the Farthest Star and A Question of Faith.  Keep going Renee and I hope Hollywood sees you for the truly wonderful actress we fans know you are!!!!!,1520812800,,487,4.318681318681318
8435644,3,B004M7YRTM,"It was OK, but the repeated scenes were a bit overdone. Renee did a good job with the script she had to work with, but her talents deserve more.",1487635200,,144,4.0
8435645,4,B004M7YRTM,This is a ghost story plain and simple. Oconnor has a car mishap and exits the vehicle alive only later to find her dead body inside the vehicle.,1487289600,,145,4.214285714285714
8435646,3,B004M7YRTM,"Keeps you guessing, keeps your attention and Rene O'Connor is in it. That's the three stars. Another half cause I liked it.",1455148800,,123,4.636363636363637
8435647,1,B004M7YRTM,"I really wanted this to be decent. I wasn't expecting much, but even with low expectations I can't believe an actress who truly can act would take such a pathetic script. Not one movie I could fin with Renee O'Connor in it is either unavailable, region 2, or just this one very pathetic attempt at being a movie. It has dreams mixed with reality mixed with alternate reality and the ending makes as little sense as the rest of the movie. The most interesting bits of the movie was the piano falling on her car, and the documentary on eels and how once they latch on, they never let go and often kill their host from loss of blood. And trust me, I've NOT given away the story, because there is no story. Save your money unless you just want to look at Renee with the sound off while watching some other movie.",1445212800,,808,4.287581699346405
