7719148,5,B01DL6PBRG,Look out everyone Killer Creatures are coming! Another of Mill Creek's horror movie collections this time filled with creature themed movies. I found a movie that I have been trying to find for years called It's Alive! Various other creature feature movies from the 50's to the 80's can be found here. Over half of them were new to me and my collection. This is definitely one for your collection.,1498953600,,397,4.685714285714286

7719152,1,B01DL6PBRG,"Occasionally, I have a notion to find collections of various movie genre's. Recently, I searched for 'Creature Features"" which resulted in the purchase ($15.98) of this product. This was a poor decision on my behalf. I began by reading the many product reviews then searched the individual movie ratings...Well my aspirations remain unmet, these pictures are in some cases entertaining yet in other cases practically a waste of time; I suggest that the latter clearly rank in the majority. Several of these films are practically useless due to poor transfer techniques, poor overall content or just plain unwatchably bad. Now, I concede there is merit in spending a weekend afternoon watching a B movie, but most of these films would never make the B movie team, perhaps D or more likely E. Some day, some company may feel compelled to create and market a collection of all the first rate 'Creature Features' but sadly, this is not it!",1475452800,8,935,4.924050632911392

8756347,4,B01DL6PBRG,"50 movies made during the years from 1922 through 1985.  Most are from the 50s through 70s time period, and while a few are worth watching more than once, most of them are typical low budget drive-in movie caliber, and some are so bad that if I had been involved in the writing, acting, or production of them; I would have been willing to pay to make sure my name DIDN'T appear anywhere in the credits.  They say you get what you pay for, and at less than 40 cents a movie----but----there are those times when you are just in the mood for a really bad movie, and you may even discover a new candidate (or two) for your personal list of the worst movies ever made.",1505520000,7,663,4.21259842519685
