5851944,5,B00DS79HIS,I really enjoyed watching THE MOLE MAN OF BELMONT AVENUE.  It's down right HILARIOUS!  I just loved Robert Englund in this film.  I loved him in Nightmare on Elm Street as Freddy Krueger too.  I truly recommend checking out this great horror comedy!  It's a must see!,1379030400,6,267,4.595744680851064
5851945,4,B00DS79HIS,"Had a good time watching this film at a festival last year -- always great to see Robert Englund (the one & only Freddy Krueger!) and Tim Kazurinsky (from ""SNL"" back in the day) along with a solid cast in this entertaining story about a Mole Man who infests a Chicago apartment building!  If you're on the hunt for some lighthearted scares & laughs, be sure to check this movie out for yourself!!",1378166400,5,396,4.424657534246576
5851966,1,B00DS79HIS,It was not what I expected. Should have watched trailer before purchase. Very disappointed. O.K. For someone who would like this type movie.,1394928000,,140,5.130434782608695
5851967,5,B00DS79HIS,"I can't stop watching this movie - it's a hidden gem.  The dry snark and amazing cast sold me from the opening scene.  A truly incredible find for anyone who loves comedy or horror.

Bonus: Try the drinking game in the commentary track!",1393459200,,236,4.441860465116279
5851968,2,B00DS79HIS,"I bought this movie looking for comedic horror. The only thing missing, is an apology in the commentary.  An apartment complex terrorized... I liked it better when the movie was called ""Batteries Not Included""! That had more terror in it as well.  I love B movies... Huge fan!! This is not, this is drivel with shots to the Gonads thrown in half a dozen times. It gets pretty draggy during the middle 70 minutes, while it seems the ""actors"" are trying to adlib a script.  Yes, Robert England!  He's a horror icon.. And I am telling you, he lost a bet to get this role.  There are honestly too many flaws to list.  I have a huge collection of crappily funny movies.. This isn't one!  I could not in good faith recommend this movie to anyone and still retain my soul.  As far as humor? I laugh harder at the state of the union address.  Forget the 5 star reviews.. I promise they are either family or possibly investors praying to keep their homes.",1391212800,,946,4.390804597701149
5851969,4,B00DS79HIS,"A little slow to start, but it picks up.  But in the end it's a hilarious flick that my friends and I enjoy a lot.",1388275200,,114,3.56
5851970,1,B00DS79HIS,"I bought this movie because my cat was used in one of the scenes. His name in the movie is  Tortilla, the adorable grey cat eaten by the monster.  I am a huge fan of B horror. This is just bad, sorry to say.",1388102400,,207,3.6818181818181817
5851971,5,B00DS79HIS,"I am so glad that the horror-comedy genre is exploding with new faces.  This sub-genre has become a staple of film, and that thrills me to no end; I love to laugh, but I love to be scared so this is a win-win for me all the way around.  And speaking of winning, THE MOLE MAN OF BELMONT AVENUE takes the gold if you're looking for laughs and scares.  This low-budget feature will have you rolling with fits of laughter and then cringing the next minute in fear!

This film is so much fun.  I liked it from the second it started and continued on through its entirety.  I can say without a doubt that its good from start to finish.

THE MOLE MAN OF BELMONT AVENUE is shot well and the production value looks high even though IMDB estimates the budget was only around $350k.  The team made good use of their funds, though, and the result is a great looking film.

The acting is first rate, with directors Mike Bradecich and John LaFlamboy headlining a great cast.  I am impressed with this duos versatility, as they portray excellent characters but then coordinate the film shoot as well.  Throw in the talents of a horror icon like Robert Englund and youve got the ingredients for one hell of a film.  I also have to give a special shout out to one of the actors I know, T.J. Jagodowski.  He plays a stoner named Paulie and owns his character with true flair.  T.J. was a summer counselor for a pre-college program I was in way back in 1992, so Im proud to see him on the big screen.

THE MOLE MAN OF BELMONT AVENUE is full of comedy, but the horror is intense, too.  There are plenty of jumps and a few scares to go along with the funnies.  But I found myself chuckling more than I did jumping.  This is certainly not a bad thing, either, as I like my horror-comedies full of fun.

THE MOLE MAN OF BELMONT AVENUE is a definite win for me and I highly recommend it.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1383782400,,1914,4.234806629834254
5851972,5,B00DS79HIS,I thought I was going to see a horror film when I bought the Mole Man of Belmont Ave. but I laughed from beginning to end. Cheeky. Very Cheeky.,1381536000,,143,3.9655172413793105
5851973,5,B00DS79HIS,I loved the movie. I have been waiting awhile for it to be released on DVD. I hope Zombie Army does more movies.,1381190400,,112,3.9130434782608696
5851974,4,B00DS79HIS,"So I thought it was funny and clever.  Some of Marion's dialogue in particular is forever quotable. I'm happy to own my very own copy so I can share it with others. I can definitely see these filmmakers moving on to even bigger and better projects. I predict this movie could develop a cult-like following - perhaps like ""Clerks"" did.",1379289600,2,334,4.566666666666666
5851975,1,B00DS79HIS,but not in a good way.  kinda amatuer formulaic dribble.  thats really all i have say.  watch at your own risk.,1379289600,,111,4.190476190476191
8596987,3,B00DS79HIS,"Overall a solid movie with an interesting premise and some amusing moments. I felt like the cinematography was a little bland, there needed to be bit more gore to sell the dark comedy aspect and the final confrontation could've used some better action, but it's still pretty well executed and entertaining.",1520294400,,306,5.019607843137255
8596988,5,B00DS79HIS,Very funny movie. I love a good horror comedy,1476403200,,45,4.111111111111111
8596989,4,B00DS79HIS,Decent Movie for die hard Robert Englund fans.,1438732800,,46,4.875
8596990,3,B00DS79HIS,Very low budget but still very fun. The 2 lead guys are brothers and they own a very run down building with just a few tenants and all of the tenants small pets keep going missing. It does have its fun times but I would not say it is side splitting.,1437091200,,249,3.9019607843137254
8596991,5,B00DS79HIS,I'm a horror/ comedy movie freak and this is a top notch offering!,1435536000,,66,4.153846153846154
8596992,5,B00DS79HIS,"Hey guys, you should really only watch this movie if you like SUPER CRAZY AWESOME THINGS. I watched this movie and then I hit my head on a wall a few times to knock some of the awesome out, there may have actually been a little too much awesome in this movie. Plus, I feel I should mention that I just randomly stumbled on this movie and bought it with money and watched it and loved it so much I came here to write this really glowing review. As opposed to something crazy like me being one of the people who made it who just came here and thought it would be a good idea to bolster it's overall score with a five-star review because he's a little drunk. I'm definitely that first thing, not that second thing at all.",1422230400,,718,4.135714285714286
8596993,4,B00DS79HIS,"I'll warn you ahead of time: this movie is bad. However what makes this work is that the movie is intentionally bad and tries to have fun with this element, akin to some of the older schlock horror films. It's something that was done with the intention to just be entertaining and for the most part it succeeds in this task. It's also pretty impressive when you consider that this was the directors' first movie and that their only other directorial experience was with a short film, Tyler's New Bike.

So what works with this film? It has some jokes here and there that are pretty effective and while they're not belly laugh type of jokes, they are the ""snort and roll your eyes"" type of jokes. This movie knows that most comedy horror films can't really be horror *and* comedy, so it decides to go for the comedy route and doesn't really invest much energy in trying to make the mole man scary. If anything, this is comparable to Ernest Scared Stupid in how it approaches any actual scares: meaning that unless you are five, this film won't scare you. The main characters are likable enough for the most part, although I did find them somewhat annoying at points. The film's strongest points are easily its secondary characters, who are played by some fairly recognizable faces- most notably Robert Englund. He's absolutely fantastic here and woefully isn't in this as much as most of us will want him to be.

What didn't work? The film felt like it was about 20 minutes longer than it actually was and I couldn't help but feel that this might have worked better as a shorter film, maybe about 50-60 minutes in length. Some elements could have easily been cut out and some characters merged into others. This is a surprisingly large cast for this type of film and (slight spoiler) there's only one human fatality so they're not here as human fodder.

However keeping in mind that this is their first film out of the gate, this works surprisingly well. It's the type of film that I'd suggest viewing on one of the various subscription streaming sites out there (which is how I viewed it), but I might not necessarily purchase it on DVD. I would watch it again with some friends, especially if they're in the mood for a cheesy film. If you're looking for anything that is actually scary, look elsewhere. This is technically a horror film, but I'd consider it to be a comedy with some horror elements than an actual out and out horror film.",1418342400,,2439,4.576659038901602
