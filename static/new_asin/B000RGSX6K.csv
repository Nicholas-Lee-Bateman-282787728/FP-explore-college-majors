8200558,5,B000RGSX6K,I'm not one of these guys that just picks up a guitar and in 10 minutes he can play basic chords to a song. Denny Sokin has put together a review of what he's learned as a professional guitarist playing with a band and I really appreciate what he's pu in this DVD. I'll be reviewing this and learning stuff from him for a long time.,1374278400,,332,4.045454545454546

8200560,5,B000RGSX6K,"This is the first guitar instructional dvd I purchased and after buying 4 more in 3 years, it's still the 'go-to' dvd. The style is wide, not deep, but it's perfect. Denny touches on many different styles of guitar, and hits on so many different topics, it keeps you coming back over and over again. His ""hybrid' fingerstyle technique had me finger picking in less than an hour and feeling confident about it in a day or two. I went from 0-60 pretty quickly.

The format is friendly, very easy to follow and fun. I will have to buy a new copy one of these days, as I'm sure I'll eventually wear this one out. The pdf booklet that comes with it is huge, I printed it and use it as a study book along with the dvd.

I heartily suggest you add this to your library.

8200561,4,B000RGSX6K,"Mr. Sarokin is a good teacher of guitar technique.  For the price of one private guitar lesson, you have Mr. Sarokin available to teach you licks that would require years of private lessons to learn.  I am most pleased with my purchase and recommend it to all who are interested in mastering the guitar.",1202688000,4,303,4.592592592592593
