8199714,1,B000R9GMB0,Amazon should give everyone who bought this a free DVD.  An 8 minute dvd--give me a break.,1262822400,,90,4.294117647058823
8199715,4,B000R9GMB0,"Keystone comedies are usually one reel films running at about 8 minuets in length. This film is really a half reel six minute picture. I can understand why some are upset by this purchase but personally I knew what I was getting. I would like to see these films released in a box set instead of packaged individually. It can be deceptive to someone who in not familiar with silent film and these films deserve an organized package. I'm wondering why the distributor chose to release these films this way and will probably wait for a more comprehensive box set that commemorates the Keystone films. The Bangville police is a Keystone classic Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling and all. When will we see all preserved Keystone films released in order filmed and not have to buy them 6 minutes at a time?",1260921600,,795,4.6453900709219855
8199716,1,B000R9GMB0,"I must agree with R. Pearson.  At only 8 minutes stated length (actual length is 7:32) this is woefully short.  with the $9.99 price tag that is over a dollar per minute.  Not a lot of Bangville for the buck.  It's a good thing Lord of the Rings is not priced at a dollar a minute!
  Further, this is not the keystone cops as pictured on the cover of the disk.  Those cops are the ones I remember seeing sometimes on TV when I was a kid in the 70's.  The cops in this short are not uniformed, but rather just a bunch of yokels.
  The story set up is pretty good.  The girl sees two strange men in the barn and calls the cops. Hijinks ensue, but the two men are not apprehended or identified.",1227225600,11,691,4.007352941176471
8199717,1,B000R9GMB0,"THIS DVD is only 8 minutes worth of Keystone Kops!

I am very very very disappointed in Amazon for not disclosing that up front. I would have not purchased this if I had known.

Shame on you Amazon.",1193788800,11,198,4.184210526315789
