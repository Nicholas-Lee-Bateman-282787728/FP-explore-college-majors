8726253,5,B012L95RF0,"This is an exceptional DVD that is both graceful and emotionally moving.
I very much enjoyed following along with Cynthia, and was able to learn
each Tai Chi move. It was beautiful to watch her put all the
moves together in nature. The Tai Chi is poetry in motion. The DVD contains
David Darling's Grammy award winning music and
the authentic Chinese Erhu.
