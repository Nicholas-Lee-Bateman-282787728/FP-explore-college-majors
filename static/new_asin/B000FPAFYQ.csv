8125380,5,B000FPAFYQ,"When I was a kid my brother and I found a VHS of this at a yard sale that had the label ripped off. We took it home just to see what was on it, and loved it. I'm 30 now, and we still sing the Oval and Shapeless songs regularly, but could not for the life of us figure out if this existed outside of that VHS we found as kids. You won't believe how excited I was to find this wasn't just something the guy having the yard sale made himself.

The look on my brother's face when I played it for him was so priceless I regret not having a camera going at the time.",1384992000,,560,3.7457627118644066
