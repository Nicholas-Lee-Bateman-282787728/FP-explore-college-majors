8473067,4,B005HIBWHK,"This movie is about a widow with grown children who volunteers her services to the CIA.  She loves her country and is prepared to give her life.  She says she is expendable.  Her character is well fully realized and interesting. I have also read the book and Darren McGavin may not match the book's portrayal of Farrell (the other spy she is thrown with), but he is very entertaining.  This is a great movie.  Rosalind Russell is in every scene and she makes the movie.  She is a terrific actress and the plot moves along, never taking too long on any of the scenes. I love the line when the man at the CIA says of Mrs. Pollifax, ""Oh, she lies beautifully; her polygraph doesn't mean a thing.""  Darren McGavin's character helps to liven things up.",1367107200,2,747,4.448529411764706
8473068,2,B005HIBWHK,"I love al of the Mrs. POllifax books and looked forward to seeing this.  I was disappointed in the casting.
Rosalind Russell was ok, but Darrin McGavin was not John Sebastian Farrell!",1364947200,4,183,4.71875
8473069,3,B005HIBWHK,"While this movie is based upon the first Mrs Pollifax book, the key word I would use is loosely based.

She appears much younger in the movie than I would have expected, and isn't nearly as quirky or likable as she is in the book, less human and vulnerable. Because of time, major sections of the book do not appear, particularly the first portion, where she as an older adult begins to feel useless and wonders what she can do. This is the aspect that has appealed to me through the book.

Still, it is an OK movie, out of date, so I have given it three stars.",1360195200,7,561,4.185185185185185
