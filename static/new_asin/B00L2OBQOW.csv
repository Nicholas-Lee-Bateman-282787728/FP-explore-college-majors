My kids love it , and yes the animation is crappy ... But kids don't care , adults do .
It's a kids video - from the 80s redone . Love it !!!!",1467244800,,184,3.5121951219512195
8663402,3,B00L2OBQOW,"The ANIMATION WAS DONE WITH A LOW BUDGET...VERY CREEPY, AND VERY SCARY FOR LITTLE KIDS.
I BELIEVE THE CLASSICS SHOULD BE REDONE IN GOOD 3D ANIMATION.
THE AMAZING TORAH BIKE ANIMATED VIDEO (WHICH IS HARD TO FIND) IS ALSO VERY DISTURBING.
I DO RECOMMEND LISTENING TO THEM THOUGH...",1433289600,,279,4.833333333333333
