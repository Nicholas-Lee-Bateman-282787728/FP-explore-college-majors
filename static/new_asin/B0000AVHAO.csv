1909203,4,B0000AVHAO,"Angelica Lee is terrific. She anchors this film and keeps your interest.
The version I have is from Hong Kong and features:
DTS 5.1 Sound
Digitally Color Remastered
Region Free
I'm wondering if there is a compelling reason to get the Lions Gate version? I almost bought it anyway just so I could have both versions. Can someone add more input on this version's specifications and/or differences from the overseas versions?
Update: I have since purchased the Lions Gate version and found it to be very much superior in picture quality and the soundtrack is also a bit better. A great presentation of a very good horror flick.",1066780800,2,624,4.787037037037037
1909204,5,B0000AVHAO,"I was totally blown away by this movie. i watched it because it sounded interesting and i love horro movie.s it sounded like the sixth sense but this is far and away better then the sixth sense!
Its about a blind girl who receives a transplant and gets her sight. although when she gets her sight she begins seeing ghosts. she doesnt know this for awhile because shes never had sight and doesnt know teh difference of what is real and not real. and the ending is a shocker. this is one i would watch a few times and recommend to friends. the acting direction and score were all excellant. recommend this movie to friends. hopefully people will not ignore it just becasue it ahs subtitles!
if you get a chance watch this gem of a movie.",1066521600,5,735,4.372262773722627
1909205,4,B0000AVHAO,"Hollywood is slowly but surely starting to learn a very important lesson: American audiences are getting fed-up with cookie-cutter substandard mass-produced dumbed-down lowest-common-denominatorism. American Movies don't try to challenge us anymore -- they are either overblown rehashes of tired themes, endless sequels, product promotions, and purely revenue-generating vehicles. Not to say that there aren't some real gems to be found, but they are becoming rarer.

But when given a choice (which, all too often, American audiences are NOT given), Hollywood faces the risk of an awakening in movie goers that desires-- or demands --to be given more credit for our (often dormant) sophistication. So it should come as no major surprise that Hollywood is turning more and more to EAST ASIA to help fill this ever-growing void.

But even then, Hollywood still cannot seem to get it quite right. Gore Verbinski's (DreamWorks) remake of Nakata Hideo's ''RING'' not only changed too many story elements of the original Japanese version, but warped the entire mood of the film from a creepy supernatural psychological thriller to a 'pee-your-pants' special effects scarefest. Disney's ""Mirimax"" division hacked & reworked Tsui Hark's ''THE LEGEND OF ZU'' so badly that what was originally a brilliant movie was universally panned by American test audiences and never saw theatrical release -- and which may not even see ""STV"" (""straight-to-video"") release now that the DVD of the ORIGINAL version is finally being offered to North American audiences. And this sad trend of damaging decent Asian cinema features through remaking or reworking efforts shows no sign of slowing: Not too long ago Disney acquired the remake rights to Korea's ''MY WIFE IS A GANGSTER,'' and another Korean comedy, ''THE NOVELTY-SEEKING GIRL'' (a.k.a. ''MY SASSY GIRL'') has been picked up by DreamWorks SKG.

But thanks to ""Art House"" theatres and the international video/vcd/dvd market, we can get a jump on the rest of the mainstream American market, if not an outright ""exclusive"" look! One of the latest to finally be recognized here at home is Hong Kong's ''THE EYE'' (dual Cantonese title: ''JIAN GUI''; translation: ''SEEING GHOSTS'').

Wong Kar Man is a woman who lost her eyesight at an early age and undergoes surgery which gives her a chance to look at the world again. The operation proves successful in restoring her sight. In fact, the operation proves TOO successful, for in addition to giving her a second opportunity to see the world around her she receives a new and unexpected ADDITIONAL ability ... SHE SEES DEAD PEOPLE! (sound familiar?) Unlike Haley Joel Osmet's character in ''THE SIXTH SENSE,'' however, Man's ghostly encounters are not always so obvious, which adds to the suspense of the film. Man's ""visions"" are also precognitive in nature, permitting her to not only see people who are already dead, but also those who had very recently died or who are very soon to die. Between her visions of deceased individuals and images & dreams of strange locales, Man has to endure the suspicious treatment of those she confides in. But not everyone is convinced that Man is merely experiencing hallucinations, and in a few instances finds others who can collaborate her stories.

The major turning point of the film occurs when it is revealed that Man has all this time been unknowingly keeping constant company with another dead person in a very unusual way, and this revelation leads her to investigate the history of the donor eye tissue and to find out if there is some sort of a connection between the donor and the haunting visions being experienced by the recipient. ...And the film's explosive climax will be forever etched in the mind of the viewer.

And so yet another Asian film which had previously escaped the wide notice of U.S. movie goers is starting to get some much deserved recognition. Unfortunately, the average American is still ignorant of much of what's going in the world of Asian motion pictures. But make no mistake about it... ''HOLLYWOOD'' is keeping close watch.",1065398400,4,4085,5.126126126126126
1909206,3,B0000AVHAO,"Pretty interesting plot with many creepy moments. However, the movie suffers from slow pacing and an interesting but not very 'scary' last quarter if the film.",1425945600,,159,5.153846153846154

1909208,4,B0000AVHAO,The best of the 3-movie series in my opinion.  This was creepy as you tried to cheer on the hero but then saw more and more side-effects.  Makes you wonder how many strangers in the street you pass by and they're really just ghosts.,1415577600,,232,4.25
1909209,4,B0000AVHAO,"It's was not a bad movie, it's had a few scary or jumpy parts if you listen to it with surround sound. The storyline is understandable. I watched the American version before watching this, both were good overall",1408665600,,211,4.578947368421052

1909211,1,B0000AVHAO,"Having rented the ""Eye"" late one night, I sat alone in my basement expecting to be scared, instead I was completely bored by this utter pretentious attempt at ""new wave"" horror. Riding the coattails of the average and overrated Jap film, ""Ring"", this attempts to be a follow up in some way but there is no connection whatsoever, except one of the ghosts was said to be in the ""Ring"". What wasn't outright stolen from American horror films, was badly imitated in a pointless and completely dull movie. I must say that there was not one scary moment in this film, not one! If you think then that it is a ""horror film"" then you are wrong, what the director does is sludge through one hour of the most inane dialogue while amateurish and incredulous actors walk around like boring idiots. Where did they get these people?

Most of these films would do better if there was some grasp of directorial and script effort but suffice it to say, this is a real stinker. Nearing the end, the film resorts to some cheap computer animation that is like watching a video game. Do not pay attention to the young teens who say this is the ""best horror film"" ever, rent something that has credibility, this is not it. I am angered that the Chinese get credit for an ""intelligent horror film"" when they only stole and re-hashed American/Hollywood genres. Check out the American version of the ""Ring"" or ""Seconds"" (1966) directed by John Frankenheimer, much more worthy efforts.",1388361600,,1458,4.651162790697675

1909215,5,B0000AVHAO,"The Eye was a fantastic horror movie. I am a hardcore horror movie fan and have seen not too many foreign horror movies. Angelica Lee plays a blind girl who gets a cornea transplant to see it again but realizes soon she got more than she bargained for. She sees haunting visions and ghosts. I won't say too much more. The hospital scenes are creepy and atmospheric. Lee is a strong heroine who is likable. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. The third and final act of movie was awesome. I found this movie to be scary and interesting. It felt original. I really liked the ending. It's a great ghost story. It's a got a great blend of psychological scares and some gore added in. There are great suspense in scenes which make the movie exciting and keep a good pace.
  I know some people are not fans of subtitles but for this movie it's worth enduring it. The acting is good in this movie but I think the best aspect was the directing. There was a claustrophobic feel to it that you made you scared more than other horror films. I got this film for a good price on amazon and it was worth it. Of all the horror movies I've been watching this is one of my favorite. This is a great foreign film for fans who are just being introduced to the foreign horror. It's a spooky tale that will stick with you well after the credits. This movie sparked an interest in foreign horror movie films that I am going to be seeing Shutter, Ringu and One Missed Call. Some foreign films I can recommend are Let the Right One In, A Tale of Two Sisters and Imprint. Cheers!",1365811200,3,1564,4.2274247491638794
1909216,4,B0000AVHAO,Another great ghost story movie that captures the heart of spooky.  A 20 year old gets her vison restored through surgery and things start to get creepy in her daily life.  Now she must uncover what is happening before its too late.,1362787200,,232,4.5
1909217,5,B0000AVHAO,I will never know why the vapid American film industry thinks they can improve upon perfection.  This movie owns the viewer from the opening credits on  Check out the sequel.,1352937600,,174,4.766666666666667
1909218,4,B0000AVHAO,"Ghosts are perfect fodder for horror movies, but they are rarely depicted as chilling or creepy. Most ghost movies are filled with stingers, CGI, and are neutered by a PG-13 rating. The Eye, however, creeps up on you (pun intended) and will make the hairs on your arms stand on end.

A young girl, blind from the age of 2, is given a cornea transplant and slowly adjusts to being able to see again. But she sees beyond our world and is haunted by the spirits of the dead in her Hong Kong neighborhood. The movement, behavior, and appearances of the ghosts are just mesmerizing. THIS is how you do ghost movies. I also liked the shadow people, moving as blurs, guiding the recently dead into the afterlife. Twin writer/directors Danny and Oxide Pang have pulled off one of the best horror films in the past decade and have done it with more integrity than M. Night Shyamalan.

The Eye is not a slick, high-key film. It is shot in a rough, gritty texture that reminds me of late-80s horror such as Hellraiser and Paperhouse. It's a far more appropriate and engaging aesthetic than anything offered by Platinum Dunes or Dark Castle. There is a Hollywood remake, made in 200 but I couldn't care less about it. The 2002 HK version is the way to go.

The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The only extra is a trailer",1350691200,,1337,4.493827160493828
1909219,4,B0000AVHAO,"The Eye follows the young and blind Mun as she receives a new pair of eyes; unfortunately, Mun begins to see mysterious figures/ghosts that predict future deaths.

The Eye has an original story. It starts off a little slow, but picks up after about 20-30 minutes. It has plenty of creepy imagery and tension to send goosebumps across your body; blend that with some very effective and surprising jump-out scares, and you have a terrifying, yet balanced, film.  (""Why are you sitting in my chair?"" -my favorite scare for those that have seen it.) I also really enjoyed the music, it was haunting and moody. Acting was also great. It does lose some of its steam towards the end, but the actual ending was satisfying.

The Eye is a great film, and gets the job done; it terrifies and entertains. I  recommend a purchase.

The Eye has strong violence and blood. No sex or nudity.",1349481600,,875,4.619354838709677
1909220,4,B0000AVHAO,"The artistry cannot be denied, this is a beautifully photographed film; I loved the imagery throughout.  I also loved their use of sound when some of the images were purposely kept vague (as seen by the lead character, Mun, while developing her eyesight).  But I found it to be less of a horror film and more of a cautionary tale.  Yes, it had a few jolts along the way and at times it was quite unsettling, but mostly it was treated as a mystery (whose eyes are seeing what and why?).  I found the solution to the mystery incredibly sad and not a little thought provoking.  But a horror movie, no.  I don't understand why they would classify it as such.  Also, why call it The Eye when obviously 'two' eyes were involved?  (I wasted considerably time pondering that.)",1345075200,,768,4.474820143884892
1909221,4,B0000AVHAO,"""The Eye"" is classified as horror, but it plays out much more like a suspense or mystery. If you've seen the American ""The Ring,"" you can expect a very similar method of plot revelation - the characters slowly learn background through cross-country detective work as well as visions of an increasingly revealing nature (much like the contents of ""The Ring"" video tape). What differs significantly from the latter film, however, is the underlying style of ""The Eye"" and how it relates to the protagonist, Mun. The focus of this movie is visual, as you might expect with a movie about a blind girl receiving her sight, and as such it succeeds highly. As a horror movie, however, the atmosphere is all wrong. There are a number of scenes that describe the character's own terror, but its portrayal is not sufficient to invoke the same response in an audience. Why? I attribute this primarily to the character's inability to be affected by the visions she sees. As long as one knows that she is ultimately safe, it is absurd to fear for Mun's safety. As an ultimately painless affliction, this movie lacks any real threat that might delineate horror, rather than a deeply unsettling mystery to be solved. This movie is definitely worth seeing, but do so without the expectations lain before you. Yes, this movie will stimulate you and hold your interest, but it's certainly not what one reviewer called it: the scariest movie since ""The Exorcist.""",1314316800,,1443,4.846153846153846
1909222,1,B0000AVHAO,"is this a 5 star film. there's plenty of reviews already so no point in going over the plot. but sheesh, special (sickbag) mention to the scene where our previously blind heroine is all upset because she can't play with the blind music group anymore. i mean really. so this downside compared to the upside of she can actually see again is supposed to be a highly emotive scene. it's like your friend who has just won millions in the lottery turning up on your doorstep and crying about all the problems they've now got since they became rich. boo hoo. oh and another thing. you get a donation of a body part but the donor's identity must be kept secret? really, why would that be?",1297296000,,680,4.404761904761905
1909223,1,B0000AVHAO,"This movie deserves a 2.5-3, but I just had to lower the average star rating as much as possible, this movie is way too overrated.

I'm here to speak the truth. Anyone that tells you this is comparable to SHUTTER the Thai version, please don't listen. Shutter is significantly more scary, while this is not. Please do NOT mistake me using the American version as a comparison since it does indeed suck (referring to SHUTTER).

The movie contains a few unexpected scares, but no it is not that scary at all. I've watched countless amounts of scary movies, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, many other Asian countries not to name of course American horror movies and I can tell you with utmost confidence that this is not that scary.

However, it is somewhat interesting and the ending was quite surprising, HOWEVERRRRR there was one big giant flaw that I would like to point out about the ending.

*WARNING, ENDING SPOILER, WILL REVIEW HUGE ENDING FLAW*

Towards the end, if you've watched you know what I'm talking about. She's in the bus and she witness all these shadowy figures rushing past her bus. Like the other girl (the deceased one she got the eyes from) she knew that the black figures were there in preparation to bring back multiple souls to the next dimension or whatever. Basically when you die there's this grim reaper sort of figure that comes to collect your soul and guide it to the next life. Anyhow, if you pay attention, her bus is further in the back away from the overturned gas tanker truck. So she gets out of the bus and rushes towards the overturned tanker in order to warn everyone sitting in their cars that something bad was about to happen and that they should run.. You can see she's coming from behind many times when she tries to tell everyone to run away. Her BF wannabe wakes up and sees her far ahead doing so and follows.

Now what doesn't make sense is that the gas tanker blows up in a firey explosion and even their own bus, the one that they were on gets totally annihilated from the explosion. So if they were far up ahead warning everyone, how come everyone died and they were outside without any cover and survived?

Also, in the end a small piece of dust or shard ends up getting into one of her eyes. My question is, it only seems to have gotten into one of her eyes so why is she completely blinded from that? My thought would be that she would still have one good eye left.

Can someone watch this movie and confirm this with me, but this is what I saw with my observation. I don't have the movie anymore since it was not up to my standards and therefore not worthy of keeping.

One bad thing about the movie as well is that the guy (The BF wannabe, the main guy) is weak. His acting is boring and uninteresting. If she dies, I would expect him to yawn. He's suppose to add to the movie by adding maybe some intensity but man he just SUCKS.",1282003200,2,2892,4.410881801125703
1909224,4,B0000AVHAO,"This si the one they based the American version on (worth watching only because it stared Jessica Alba).

Watching this movie makes you wonder why they did a remake in the first place.  This is a suspenseful horror story and is unique among J-horror by having a moderately happy ending.

I hope the readers of this review will forgive my spelling.",1278288000,,347,4.655737704918033
1909225,5,B0000AVHAO,"THE EYE is another asian masterpiece that was turned into a weak, american remake ala PULSE, ONE MISSED CALL, etc. The biggest problem w/ the transition of THE EYE into western surroundings is the loss of all of its cultural underpinnings. Most of the fear comes from traditional religious beliefs that are essential to the story. Once these are stripped away, we are left w/ just another hollywood thriller. The Pang Brothers know how to use ancient tradition, superstition, and religion as a strong backdrop for ghostly horror. They also know that tension, dread, and creeping fear are atmospheric elements, not just gimmicks. If you enjoy movies like RINGU, JU-ON, (the original) PULSE, etc., then THE EYE can be added to your collection right now...",1277164800,,753,5.032
1909226,4,B0000AVHAO,"The Pang Brothers are very good filmmakers from Thailand and Hong Kong.  A young woman who is blind has corneal transplants to allow her to see for the first time.  Wonderful to go from blindness to sight, right?  Wrong!  Not when the new corneas allow you to see into the world of the dead!  The woman and her very young, helpful and loving therapist must go to Thailand to help a distressed ghost who was murdered!  Scary!",1255132800,2,424,4.441558441558442
1909227,5,B0000AVHAO,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. It did seem rather long, and at parts the storyline moved too slowly; but overall, it was very good. Mun was the main character, and she had an eye operation, which went well. She had acquired the corneas of a lady called Ling (I think?), who had seen ghosts prior to her suicide. So now Mun saw ghosts. Mun's psychiatrist, who is supposed to help her adjust to life as a sighted-person falls in love with her. Finally, Mun decides she needs to meet the mother of Ling and find out what happened to the woman. Since Ling committed suicide, she is doomed to repeat her same fate every night until someone intervenes.

Anyway, since this finally happens and it seems all is well and Mun is no longer seeing ghosts, she and her psychiatrist begin the journey home. Then the movie becomes similar to Final Destination, and I was yelling at my screen for everyone to get off the bus. Of course, the inevitable follows as they are stuck in traffic. I don't want to give away the ""shocking"" ending, which was fairly predictable. It's not a violent or gorey film. The scariest scenes for me were when the ghost woman in the hall approaches Mun, and the scene with the ghost man in the elevator--that one gave me chills.",1249084800,2,1249,4.502202643171806

This is a truly scary experience. The scariest moments are only a few, but they're quite effective (try getting on an elevator after watching this film). The actors are pretty good, and the music is intense. And the ending is quite disturbing, so you've been warned.

While the vast majority of Asian remakes have come from Japan, this one is from Hong Kong and features Cantonese and Mandarin speaking.  The paranormal story line is based upon the common used idea in horror movies that transplanted body parts can transfer abilities and problems from the donor to the recipient.  The effects are somewhat along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>, but there is a horror mystery element in that the reason for the phenomena must be solved.

When the heroine's eye surgery (cornea transplant) has her seeing ghosts, she must seek the help of a newfound friend to unlock the mystery.

The movie mainly consists of her experiencing various close encounters after her surgery till she finally figures out there's a connection there.  She spends the last part of the film trying to find out who her donor was and why she's seeing strange things.

The original movie is more effective and less effective than the remake in several key ways.  The original seems slightly less suspenseful, yet the remake didn't have as many effective chills.  The original had more lighthearted elements (like when the girl's friend hits on the doctor) but also seemed to create less tension as a result.  And also, the original did one thing that was much better than the remake.  In the original the heroine is a blind woman who plays in an orchestra for the blind, while the remake has her portrayed as the lead violinist in a professional orchestra, which is much harder to swallow.

Overall, I was very surprised with my conclusion.  Watching the original actually made the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/remake/dp/B0012KJ0CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">remake</a>&nbsp;look better.  Jessica Alba is much better as an actress and her performance deserved a lot more credit.  The general backlash against Asian horror remakes has hurt the remade version.  But if you really give it a chance, it is just as good and probably slightly better than the original.

As far as acting is concerned, the cast is good overall but Alba does a much better job in her version.

The special effects are somehow lower tech yet more effective in the original.  While the remake relies heavily on CG, the original has more spooky moments that are made more real with the use of shadows and nice close-up shooting.

Conclusion

Having seen the original after the remake, I have to feel that I may have been too harsh on the remake.  Despite some cool moments and a more believable back story, the original is not executed nearly as well.  It's still worth watching, but if you have to pick one pick the remake.

1909230,5,B0000AVHAO,"I love being scared. I started watching horror movies as far back as 4 years old. I even made it a point to rent every horror movie at both of my local video stores. And if a movie gave me nightmares for 2 days, I wanted to find one that would make it 3. It could've been anything. Later on I'd realise I was exposed not only from the standard American horror legends like Romero to Raimi, but also Bava and Argento from Italy and of course Hitchcock.

While that was a good long run, I became desensitised at a fairly early age by slasher and/or gore films. Only few films would leave lasting impressions on my psyche. Then I came across asian horror. Japanese staples like Ringu and Ju On were instantly in a different league. The off kilter timing and sincerity in telling a story wouldn't just scare the fairly jaded horror movie fan in me, it would shake every fibre of my being. The paranoia I felt after seeing movies like Begotten or Silence of the Lambs or even the last scene in Blair Witch could not compare to the atmosphere built by the aforementioned movies. With Asia restoring my faith in the genre, I branched out even further. And this is where The Eye comes in.

The Eye is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life. Short of spoilers, that's the best description I can give. For what it is, it's the perfect movie in it's genre. It literally immerses you into the atmosphere and spits you out without a moment's notice. I personally felt like a deer in headlights each time, stronger than the last. And when it's all over, life itself can feel like a nightmare. At least for a while. I no longer love being scared. I am simply terrified.

1909232,1,B0000AVHAO,"I saw this original version with an open mind figuring that since we just remade it here in America ""It must be pretty good right? WRONG?!! This movie lacks in any real purpose or plot in that this movie is slow paced and boring much of the time and lacks in any thing even closely resembling a plot! And I particularly hate the ending where the main character Mun both faces a circumstance similar to the girl who's cornea she got donated went through! That being that before the young girl commited suicide she tried to warn everyone in the village about a fire naturally though since everyone believed her to be cursed and ostracized her for it no one would listen until it was too late! Well anyway we experience an ""Eye"" numbing flash between the past and present as Mun tries to warn a bunch of people on a traffic jammed bridge about a possible explosion and of course no one would listen! and as if that wasn't bad enough cinders from the explosion burn her eyes to the point of giong blind again!

1909233,2,B0000AVHAO,"First off, this film is not very frightening. True, it has a couple chilling creepy moments (like the elevator) but other than that, I was actually surprised by the lack of scares. The story was easy enough to follow and from what I remember, wasn't confusing. However, the end of the film pretty much ruined the rest of the movie for me. It was just weird, but not in a cool way. It just seemed off and it reminded me of another movie I've seen that had the same type of idea- Final Destination, which was alot better. It wasn't a bad movie, just an uninteresting one with a lack of chills.",1202774400,2,591,4.285714285714286

Lots of jumpy parts and just a killer story line of which can only be found in asian folklore and untarnished by the american movie horror syndicates. Overall I gave it a 4 out of five because the story tended to drag a little and lost my attention for the most part. BUT I really like the story in a whole and thought is was very original and worth buying. Some parts even had my heart skip beats because of the no so obviously impacting moments where the ghost comes out of nowhere and well... SCARES YOU.,1196035200,2,651,4.216

It will always be on my top ten list of great films. Any movie that can move me like this did it well worth the cheap price of the dvd. I really don't recommed this for childern though.

1909238,5,B0000AVHAO,"A disquieting film more than a frightening story. A young woman, after a nearly total life of blindness, recuperates her eyesight after getting new corneas grafted on her eyes. But along with them she gets the visionary capability of the young woman who donated them, after her own death. The film does not try to frighten us or even terrorize us. It tries to convince her that this story is true with two doctors as main witnesses and extremely realistic shooting and editing. We are immersed into the story as if it were absolutely normal and true, without any special effects and extraordinary events. What's more it insists on the disturbing effect of this power onto the young woman, to the point of her preferring going back to blindness. Then we end up with extremely disquieting questions. Is eyesight responsible for our unhappiness or mishaps? Do we learn how to reject what we don't like along with seeing when we are children in a segregative not to say racist way? Is our seeing tamed and conditioned early in our life? And this creates in us an uneasy feeling that makes us shrink away from something that could very well be a true fact since our education is not to teach us to see everything but to see in the proper way. The film is trying to convince us of this brainwashing we have been through without even knowing it. Isn't it then better to refuse to see and lock ourselves into some kind of artificial blindness that will protect us from the nightmares of real life. What we do not see does not exist. Isn't that blindness nothing but the same thing as the selective seeing of normal people?

1909240,5,B0000AVHAO,"Yet another Asian masterpiece.  If you want a frightening yet thoughtful movie, you have to really stick with Asian movies because no one does it better.  The Eye is a perfect example.  From the start of the movie to the end, I was completely enthralled.  Kudos to the Pang brothers for creating such a beautiful, well-crafted movie.  Angelica Lee is gorgeous and plays the role of the blind woman very convincingly.  All the actors are perfectly cast in their roles.  This is kind of a sad scarry movie because (without giving too much of the plot away) the psychic girl was considered a witch and what was her gift became her curse...which she passed on.  There are several truly frightening scenes and one very unexpected horrific one.

If you enjoy good ghost stories, intelligent storylines, great acting, and a visual masterpiece you will love this movie.  Look for several Korean folklore symbols the Pang brothers have cleverly included in the film, such as the man standing in the middle of the road and the woman's face in the metro window!",1189641600,2,1050,4.783333333333333

But when she starts to realize that many of the people around her are no longer living she has no idea how to handle it.  Will anybody believe her?  Will anybody help her?  How can she explain what she is seeing when she was only blind a few days before?
While the film has a few moments that did make my heart race and made me jump in my seat, most of the movie is a chilling thriller, in which the viewer comes to understand what is happening well before Mun and cheer her on.  The end is both sad yet also a happy one.

1909245,4,B0000AVHAO,"I'm a reasonably seasoned horror-phile, and yet this movie made my skin crawl - atleast for the first half where the main character discovers that she is endowed with 'extra-ordinary' insights subsequent to her corneal transplant. Overall, the theme hems to the expected formula and the eventual resolution is more-or-less predictable. However, the ambience for the first half of the movie is extremely successful at being *creepy*.

Stay away if you are looking for mindless gore.

'The Eye' employs atmosphere & tight framing to create nauseating claustrophobic chills. It manipulates your imagination more than the visual senses.

The only reason I give it a 4 stars is because I felt that the latter half of the movie wasn't quite upto the standards set by the former.  Most of the strong points of the presentation are exhausted by the first half. But then again, it is my subjective opinion only. And oh, the movie is definitely worth a watch.",1178668800,2,1270,6.5476190476190474
1909246,5,B0000AVHAO,"For a blind person, it would seem like a dream come true to have their sight restored. But what if it came with a price? That is the idea behind the Pang Brothers' ""The Eye"" (""Jian gui""), one of the most minimalistic -- and chilling -- horror movies in years.

Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee) has been blind since she was two, but a cornea transplant restores her sight. At first she can only see blurry figures. But then, Mun sees shadowy phantoms leading away the spirits of the dead. Even worse, she sees the ghosts of suicides lingering on, doomed to repeat their deaths until they are put to rest.

Horrified by this, she goes to her psychotherapist Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) for help. Stretching professional ethics, the lovestruck doctor manages to get the records of the donor, and they go to see her family in a rural village. And guided by dreams and visions, Mun learns of the tragic life of a girl, Ling, who could foresee death...

If you like serial killers, buckets of blood and screaming blondes in your horror movies, don't watch ""The Eye."" As a horror movie, it will be too subtle, too quiet, and too full of intelligent questions about life and death.

There are only a couple of real ""horror"" moments in here, where things look grotesque. Most of the time, it's psychological in nature; at one point, we hear that suicides are doomed to repeat their deaths -- it's horrifying enough to contemplate someone killing themselves, but doing it over and over? Even worse, we see this in action.

And the Pang Bros. handle this wonderfully. Many of the ghosts appear and vanish quickly, giving a shock to the audience; at other times, they explore the changes that sight brings to Mun's life. But at the same time, the Bros. add a softer side to this movie, such as Ling's reconciliation with her mother. It's a credit to the Bros. that this is touching, not syrupy.

A lot of the impact of the film can be credited to Lee and Chou. Lee especially, for showing a range of emotions, including joy, grief, hysteria and peaceful acceptance. Boyishly handsome Chou balances out Mun in a very believable, by merely being a pillar of strength and believing her seemingly crazy stories. The only flaw is that he seems to fall for her too quickly.

The DVD also comes with a very insightful featurette, which sheds a lot of light on the film's background and production. The actors talk about their characters, the directors talk about creating gas explosions and ghosts. And we hear from the people whose stories inspired the ghosts in this film, such as the guy standing in the highway.

With good acting and a really chilling script, ""The Eye"" is one of the rarest kinds of horror -- the kind that horrifies the mind, rather than the stomach. Mesmerizing and really spooky.",1177113600,15,2775,4.626016260162602
1909247,4,B0000AVHAO,"Starting this review off by saying I love Asian ghost films at this point would be beating a dead horse(who would then come back to haunt me by crawling towards me in jump-cut fashion with long, scraggly black hair-but i digress) but there's a reason; they are usually very good. Even mediocre Asian ghost fare is better than almost all the recent attempts at spook movies America has had to offer lately, and it's because they aren't afraid to scare the hell out of you. Their movies typically incorporate stylistic and subtle means, realizing that many times whats in the peripheral or just beyond line of sight can be terrifying, plus many times they aren't afraid to  even get bizarre to illicit fear. Enter: The Eye.

The Eye contains everything that i think is right with Eastern Horror and at the same time illuminates the flaws in the sort of thing we typically are treated to 'round here:spirits of all kinds, a protagonist we can care for, atmosphere and subtlety along with some big scare moments,etc.

The basic plot is this: Mun(played exquisitly by possibly the most beautiful asian woman Ive ever seen, Sin-je Lee) has been blind since the age of two. She undergoes organ transplant corneal replacement surgery and is able to see again and almost instantly realizes that she might be seeing things other people aren't supposed to. She and her pysychothereapist Dr. Lo(nephew of Dr. Lo???) discover that the peeper donor was ""gifted"" a la The Sixth Sense and that as long as Mun has those eyes, those eyes will see dead people.

Pretty simple and almost deriviative plot right? Right. But it aint the size, it's what you do with it. The Eye is a suspenseful,well acted, well directed creep-out that grabs you right from the start. The Pang brothers(the directing team) know how to take a scenario we've seen before and give it enough of a fresh spin to at least still be scary, and believe me it is. The ghosts themselves range from normal looking to deformed to wispy and bizarre and that was a great touch. It never allows you to get used to seeing them because you have no idea how they are going to present themselves, also the added bonus of Mun having almost no frame of reference as to how people actually look and move, there are times when she is in the presence of a ghost and simply has no idea when anyone else would have already beaten it outta there so fast they would have left a cloud shaped like themselves in their wake. The Character of mun herself is extremely sympathetic and my hat's off to Mrs Lee for making what must have been an almost impossible situation seem very real. I did have to grow on her , she is amazingly beautiful and I was taken aback at first, but she aint juts a pretty face. When she first gains her sight though, it was underplayed to the point where I could barely tell she cared,  as the movie carried forward, she became more open and as the horrors begin to unfold, she begins to unravel and as opposed to simply playing it scared, Mrs Lee finds alot of different levels and places to go and juts the process itself must have been exhausting. She pulls it off with grace and allows us to not only fear the ghosts, but care about her well-being.

The movie isn't perfect though(hence four instead of five stars). The scares wear off in the second half and except for Mrs Lee, there's noone to really root for. Obviously this is her story and any other supporting characters are just that, but it would have been nice for them to have had more depth and at least make decisions that seem logical. Mun needing their help is one thing, but young Dr. Lo falls in love with her improbably quickly and accepts the fact that she sees ghosts and can predict peoples deaths even moreso, and the elder Dr Lo is played as a hardline skeptic, but in the interest of simply moving the story along begins to believe her too and puts his entire career at a huge risk to help her discover where the haunted pupils came from.

These overall are small gripes and it didn't hurt my enjoyment of the movie much. It held my attention and better than that, scared the crap out of me so there's no way I can't recommend the flic. Watch it in the dark, marvel at mrs Lee's beauty, pee your pants.",1172707200,2,4234,4.48378728923476

1909249,4,B0000AVHAO,"I'm just going to ""cut to the chase"" here. Currently, Asian horror is the most innovative the world has to offer. Still, it can be ""hit or miss"" (for me). I loved ""Ju-On"" but loathed ""Ringu."" I'm nuts about ""Battle Royale"" but I think ""Ichi the Killer"" is over-rated. And, admittedly, ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" had me thoroughly confused (it's not the film's fault, it's mine . . . trust me). Hence, I never know what new film is going to thrill me or frustrate me. So when one of my students gave me ""The Eye,"" I was initially reluctant to watch it. Yes, this piece has great online reviews . . . but are they warranted? Absolutely.

The film is a straight-forward, linear tale which enchants its audience within the first fifteen minutes. And, while it is creepy, it has none the the conventional trappings of American film (there are no ""jump-out-of-your-skin"" moments). It is the subtle presentation of the supernatural that makes it truly interesting (like the partially obscured woman with the curiously purple tongue). Moreover, while there are some familiar strains to the story, the ending is a pleasant surprise. (Yes, I can see how some leap to the conclusion that this film ""toys"" with Shyamalan's work . . . I initially saw that too . . . but upon reflection, there are many unique complexities to this film).

The acting is fantastic . . . the chemistry between the performers is impressive. The cinematography is quite appealing. There are potential moments of frustration in the film's beginning . . . when we see life through the new, blurry eyes of Mun . . . but this is meant to connect us to her character . . . so be patient with this.

Bottom-line: this is a well-crafted film that does not fail to please. Enjoy!!!",1172016000,,1735,4.590322580645161

The ghosts are somewhat grotesque in this flick,
and thats just the way I like them.
That's right; there's finally an asian horror movie, where the spirits
aren't creepy, long-haired oriental chicks.
Not that I mind that,
but it would really suck if every vampire movie was Dracula.
Not too much in the way of dialogue here,
but who cares when the atmosphere is super tense.
Imagine never being able to see a thing,
and when you're finally able to,
you see the world is inhabited by by ghastly spirits.
A must-have for anyone into ghost movies or asian flicks.
Better than pretty much anything Hollywood (or Asia for that matter)
has to offer in the way of ghost movies.
Don't get me wrong,
""The Sixth Sense"" is still my favorite all-around,
but ""The Eye"" is definitely a close second.

When exchanging problems with others,
you always wind up with you own.",1170201600,2,1593,4.4
1909251,4,B0000AVHAO,"`The Eye' has been compared to `The Sixth Sense' by many a reviewer, and while the similarities are there `The Eye' is far from a carbon copy of it's English predecessor.  Yes both films revolve around someone haunted by visions of ghosts, but where `The Sixth Sense' is emotionally reaching `The Eye' remains visually disturbing and heaps on the coals of fear like there was no tomorrow.  This film is scary in broad daylight.  Personally I feel `The Sixth Sense' to be a better all around film, but `The Eye' further proves that Asian directors know how to captivate the audience when it comes to horror.

This films innocent medium is Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee), a young woman who's been blind since the age of two and has just gone under the knife to have a cornea transplant renewing her ability to see.  With this wonderful gift though comes a haunting realization...she can see the dead.

This film is, as mentioned, visually haunting.  When she awakes from her nightmares to see her very bedroom shifting from living to dead it's breathtaking and completely absorbing.  One truly terrifying inclusion was the grim-reaper type character that appears blurry and almost transparent.  Every time this man is on the screen I felt chills.  The Pang Brothers who directed this film masterfully created the perfect tone to tell this story, and while it may draw some likeness to a film we've all seen it doesn't mean it should be disregarded for it still has the ability to scare you senseless.",1169424000,3,1495,4.782101167315175
1909252,3,B0000AVHAO,"""The Eye"" is by no means a bad film.  It is, in fact, better than a lot of the J-Horror that has started washing up here in the States like so much cinematic driftwood.  That being said, while the film has in interesting premise, high production values, and a tangible feeling of creepiness, it never really manages to be SCARY.  ""Unsettling"" is probably the best word describe it, as opposed to something like ""pulse-pounding"".  Don't get me wrong, there are scenes that will give you the heebie-jeebies, maybe even one or two that will give you a good startle, but nothing that will stick with you past the end credits.

Furthermore, most of the intriguing parts of film come in the first two acts, while the ending (or at least the final explanation of what's going on) seemed just a tad rushed when it finally arrived.  In any event, while the movie kept my attention and had some very neat touches (especially the spooky scenes in the second act), I just never got the feeling that the heroine was ever in any real danger from the ghosts she suddenly found herself able to interact with.  The lack of an actual threat to the protagonist may drive me to distraction more than it would other viewers, but I found it to detract somewhat from the film.  (Otherwise I would have easily given it 4 stars.)

If you're looking for a J-Horror film along the lines of ""Ring"" or ""Ju-on"" or ""Shutter"" (Thai, I know), then ""The Eye"" doesn't quite fit the bill.  On the other hand, viewers wanting more of an understated horror experience find a lot to like about ""The Eye"".

One minor gripe: Perhaps my DVD player is somehow messed up, but in my copy of the film all the Japanese scenes are in Japanese (naturally), but the scenes taking place in Thailand all appear to be dubbed into English.

The story line is simple and straight forward; a young female musician is blind until she receives a corneal implant from another young woman who has committed suicide. The movie does an excellent job of allowing the audience to experience the creepy results of this exchange before rushing in to explain everything. The audience is given plenty of time to become attached to the main character and curious about the female eye donor. This isn't a film that requires foreknowledge of Asian myths or uban legends.

1909256,5,B0000AVHAO,"I am well known to like all kinds of horror movies. You can name any gore movie and I will have probably seen it. From Cannibal Holocaust to Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer to mainstream Hollywood movies like Silence of the Lambs.

There are two types of horror movies one is the gore type and the non gore type like The Others and The Sixth Sense. Both movies are fantastic with each having an excellent twist, that had people talking for days. It's important for me to start my review with this short introduction for those people who do not know me personally just to give an idea what kind of movies i have seen and appreciate.

Let me start with my review about The Eye here. A few weeks ago I was browsing the internet checking out some new horror movies out on dvd when I noticed a particular dvd by the name of The Eye. I started looking for some information about this movie and could not find anything since the original name of this movie is Jian Gui. So I tracked down the directors name on IMDB Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang. I had never heard of these two brothers before and i started searching about Jian Gui. When I finally had enough information to convince myself to purchase this dvd I told my video dealer to get me this movie.

This is without a doubt the scariest movie i have ever seen on my own. Even the opening credits on the dvd are scary. Many have compared this movie with the Sixth Sense. True, it does borrow something from it but The Eye literally stands as a movie on its own. You cannot try to compare Chicago with Moulin Rouge which are both musicals but so much different from one another(yes i love serious movies too and a lot):)

The Eye is about this blind girl who gets a cornea transplant to see the beauty of this world like other people see, but she gets to see much much more than beauty! I will not go into the plot detail of the movie i will leave that for the viewer to experience on his own. There were moments where I was scared stiff and had tears in my eyes. The Pang Bros have directed a Masterpiece in horror with an amazing technique that has never been seen. Beautiful angle shots and imagery that must be seen again and again. The visual effects are very good but the most memorable thing about this movie is the environment effect it has through out the whole movie.

I must also mention that there are some nice touching moments too that will have you jerking a tear apart from jumping on your sofa.

I have recently read that Mr Tom Cruise has bought the rights to remake this movie again. I urge you to see this movie now before Hollywood gets their hands on this Masterpiece. I am sure that the story will be totally changed like they changed Insomnia, The Ring and Open Your Eyes(Vanilla Sky). I Just hope that at least Mr Cruise has the dignity to leave all the tension Jian Gui has!

One last thing to end this review. If this movie is really based on a true story than without a doubt this is truly the scariest movie ever. You have been warned.",1164499200,4,3015,4.278947368421052

1909258,5,B0000AVHAO,"Great movie. It's fantastic visuals, it's got edge of your seat shock, but most importantly it's got a great storyline.  That is what sets the Pang Brother movies apart from other horror movies.  The blood and violence aren't necessarily gratuitous, but it's appropriate.  The movie gets to you on two level: visually and mentally. Occasionally there a movie makers who by name alone (like hitchcock) you know you're going to get a good movie.  I'll be bold enough to say that the Pang Brothers not only try to surpass Hitchcock, but the also do so with great success.  I'll watch their movies sight/review unseen simply because I know what to expect. Great visuals and an even greater ""life-affirming"" beautifully disguised as horror.",1156550400,19,735,4.991803278688525
1909259,5,B0000AVHAO,"While reading up on scenes that made people jump, one that often came up was 2 from the Eye, a Japanese film made a couple of years ago. Going to the video store, I thought ""I doubt they'd have it but let me go look for it anyway"" and sure enough I found it so I got that and didn't regret it one bit. While the story isn't original and it kind of peters out after awhile, it's anchored by a solid performance and genuinely creepy moments throughout the film.

Mun has been blind since the age of 2. In her late 10's/early 20's(it's never specified), she undergoes a cornea transplant, letting her see finally. And everything is great and she's quite excited over it. That is until weird people start showing up and freaking her out which makes her wonder: just whose eyes did she get? Helping her is a psychiatrist who wants to believe her but is burdened by his more-than-friends feelings for her.

The film isn't that original as there have been several films based around being in possession of a haunted something. The film is of course to get comparisons to the Sixth Sense but that's an incredibly unfair statement since besides the ghost and the psychiatrist thing, they're quite different. The only thing that the Eye doesn't share with Sixth Sense is strong scenes start to finish. You can almost pinpoint where this film goes from creepy to just kind of there. The ending, which rivals the Mothman Prophecies for the biggest end disaster I've seen, is effective and a nice capper.

Now, it is a horror film so does it scare you? It sure can. Of note are 2 particular scenes: Mun gets a creepy visitation during a calligraphy class and what's probably the creepiest elevator ride you'll be on. Also watch for a face on a subway that has actually not been accounted for. These scenes, as well as a hallway visit by an old woman will most likely chill you, or at least startle you cause the music's so loud. However at a certain point, the film becomes less creepy and becomes more story driven and it's here where it kind of falls apart.

The other anchor is Anjelica Lee(credited as Lee Sin-Je) who provides a strong emotional weight to the character where you'll start to worry about her safety(especially that elevator part). The only other significant role is her doctor friend who while not given much character, becomes someone Mun can rely on for help.

In another unnecessary remake idea, it's being redone with Renee Zellweger in the role of Mun. While the last half can need some touching up, this doesn't need to be remade: it's creepy enough as it is.",1155686400,9,2572,4.570498915401301
1909260,5,B0000AVHAO,"Directors, Danny and Oxide Pang, have given the audience an excellent horror film. ""The Eye,"" is a film that is rich in both the atmosphere and creepy nuances of horror, which I find to be the best of what a horror film should be like: The suggestion of horror, not blood and gore. How refreshing it is to see a horror film that is not filled to the brim with gore, but instead gives the viewer a very good drama to go along with the horror. Moreover, the acting in the film is a plus, and further enhances this great horror film from Asia. The films narrative revolves around a young woman named Mun (Angelica Lee) who has been blind since she was 2 years old. [She gives an outstanding performance in this film.]

However, things are about to change for this young women. After undergoing a cornea transplant to help restore her eyesight, she begins to see things that are not there. The Doctors believe that this is a result of the surgery, and with time, these images will go away as her brain will accept the images sent to her from her new corneas. They believe that this is common, and that she will eventually adapt to her new found sight. Yet, events become more ominous for Mun, as she continually sees people in what appears to be an agonizing moment of their lives. She is frightened, and with the help of her doctor, she will go on a journey to find out why she is experiencing these visions.

Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) accompanies his young patient Mun, to find out who was the donor of the corneas. But as there is Doctor and Patient confidentiality concerning body donations, both come to a dead end--until they discover who this donor was. The Pang brothers take the viewer on a creepy excursion into the unknown. This is a great dramatic horror film where the suggestion of horror is enhanced by the great acting of the films two main protagonists Mun, and Dr. Wah. Moreover, it is also a very sad horror film. I particularly liked many of the location shots, especially when they both discover who the donor was. This is an excellent horror film. The Pang brothers have done a wonderful job with storytelling, suspense, mystery, and horror rolled up into one. Further, the cinematography is great. But more importantly, the film has a great story to go along with the horror. And where the story in the film takes the viewer is very creepy indeed. The film as I wrote before is sad: Something gained and something lost. This film is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1154822400,5,2469,4.533632286995516
1909261,5,B0000AVHAO,"""The Eye"" is a scary movie that gave me chills at various times throughout the film.  I admit that I wasn't expecting much out of it and only watched it because of a two sentence promo I happened to notice.  The movie starts out with an interesting human interest angle; a young blind woman may be able to see for the first time if her cornea transplants work out.  As the film progresses it seems to become a better version of ""The Sixth Sense""; a movie that predated ""The Eye"".  I won't go into more detail than that but I will compare the two movies to say that ""The Eye"" takes the premise of ""The Sixth Sense"" and does a lot more with it.  That's taking nothing away from ""The Sixth Sense"" which deserves credit for its' innovative plot.  However, we get into other cultures with other belief systems that enable the writer and director to expand the directions that they can take.  Many of those directions caught me off guard.  I have issues with the way the movie winds to an ending but maybe those objections have to do with preferring the movie continue than how it actual comes to a close.

This is a Chinese production with subtitles.  I did not find that distracting although there's always the potential for that in a horror or suspense movie.  The possible problems come from having the audience reading the dialogue when they should be focussed on the sudden video effects.  There were a lot of excellent special video effects that were pretty hard to miss yet were fleeting enough to make sure we kept on our toes throughout the movie.  The personal stories and relationships were varied and developed well enough for them to enhance the movie.

This may not be one of the greatest movies of all times but it's a movie that everyone should at least see once.  It might get better with repeated viewing but I think its' strength lies in its initial, unpredictable, shocking suspense.",1153958400,,1898,4.557522123893805
1909262,5,B0000AVHAO,"A blind girl has an operation and can finally see the world....but her new found sight also shows her the dead.

If you don't mind films with subtitles, this is a good pick. Great music for the film that really sets the mood. Very well done. More suspense or drama than horror.

The best part about this movie is that it takes the audience through the various stages of her sight.  At first, things are blurry and hazy, which makes it difficult to tell if she's seeing something real or other-worldly. Then slowly her vision improves and that's where the fun begins!",1152230400,4,566,4.529411764705882
1909263,4,B0000AVHAO,"After resisting seeing this film (about a year ago a friend told me it wasn't very good - last time I listen to a friend), I recently caught ""The Eye"" on the Independent Film Channel, and really enjoyed it, far more than I expected.  The plot has been told here before, but it's also obvious, from some of the reviews posted here, that there are people out there who didn't quite GET the plot.

The corneal transplant didn't make Mun ""cairvoyant"" as such - she could indeed see the dead, particularly those who died violently or had unfinished business in this world, as well as the shadow of death escorting them to the other world ... but the reason for this was for her to get to the truth behind the person whose eyes she now looked through (to say more would spoil the film).  Also, it wasn't unbelievable when Mun read the sign on the door of the apartment, to see she was on the wrong floor; for one thing, in previous seens the viewer was given brief glimpses into Mun adjusting to a life with sight (including a shot at learning calligraphy), and enough time had passed where reading a simple sign telling you what floor you are on was not an unreasonable stretch.  Also, for the reviwer who bad-mouth the romance as unbelievable - it wasn't ""love at first sight,"" he was her doctor and you could see that at first it was all business, and that his feelings grew for her; he didn't even believe her at first, either, but did change his mind in the scene where she proved she could see the dead again after the death of one of the characters in the film (again, am not saying more in order to not give away too much here).

It's a different kind of horror, as has also been stated - if your horror has to come with a body count and buckets of blood, this is not the movie for you - but for understated, psychological chills that affect the mind or make your mind tingle - more like, say, Hitchcock use to do - this is one very, VERY cool film.

Especially due to the ending.  Wow.  Just when you think it's going to wind down into another understated horror film ending - maybe with a creepy jolt to finish - instead, the movie takes an unexpected turn and ends with a real bang; one of the most satisfying endings to a suspense thriller (which is really what this is, over a ""horror"" film)that I've ever seen.

The performances are good all-round, and again - if you're more into the psychological mind-screwing than the visceral blood and guts horror stuff ... this one is well worth catching.",1146268800,4,2503,4.365591397849462

The acting is not that great even thought the lead actress won a best actress award at the Hong Kong Awards...but it made me laugh how bad i thoguht her acting was.  her crying seemed so fake and her scared looks were silly.  the romnace seemed like filler and was cliche (would a man that thinks a women is crazy really fall in love with her a first sight?  would he risk his whole life for some girl he just met thats running around saying that she sees ghosts everywhere? ...I don't think so).  The end was interesting and saved the movie from getting a 1 star.  i gave it a extra star for the good ending.  most horror movies end on a BAD note.  this movie is a bad not but ends on a good note.  if you like not scary movies thatt move like a snail and have bad acting, then get your copy today!  if not...get the Eye 2 because its way better.",1145750400,,967,4.058201058201059
1909265,4,B0000AVHAO,"""The Eye"" is one of the stand-out Asian horror films of the past few years, soon to be remade in Hollywood, that demonstrate how well filmmakers in the East have grasped the horror genre. The best of these films eschew bloodbaths in favor of the terror generated by the protagonists' unique view of the world, real or imagined. In ""The Eye"", a young Hong Kong woman, Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee Sing-je), who has been blind since the age of 2, undergoes a corneal transplant to restore her vision. While still in the hospital, she begins to see people who appear and disappear instantaneously, walk through walls, and do things that puzzle her. Since Mun is so near-sighted following her surgery, she cannot be sure of what she sees. It takes her a while to understand that she is seeing ghosts, and when she does, she is terrified. Her sympathetic psychotherapist Dr. Lo Wah (Lawrence Cho) decides to her help by tracking down the woman who donated Mun's corneas and now haunts her vision.

Brothers Oxide and Danny Pang wrote and directed ""The Eye"", successfully putting a new twist on the old ""I see dead people"" theme. Mun was blind, and her slowly recovering vision is distorted. She doesn't understand what she is seeing, while the audience does. This creates suspense, as the audience wonders if something bad is going to happen to unsuspecting Mun. ""The Eye"" wisely doesn't skimp on experiencing Mun's wonder and anxiety as she begins to see after her operation. The audience takes that journey with her and becomes apprehensive before she does. So we have a good deal of empathy for Mun when her vision becomes a source of terror. As her vision becomes clearer, the ghosts become creepier, and Mun's wonder at the world around her turns to horror. ""The Eye""'s strength is that it encourages the audience's sympathy for Mun to evolve as her vision and her awareness of the ghosts progresses. The Pang brothers may have taken a card from American films in having the characters try to solve the mystery and take control of their situation.

The DVD (Lion's Gate 2003): The film is mostly in Cantonese with optional English subtitles. Bonus features include one featurette, a U.S. Theatrical Trailer (2 min) and a U.S. TV Spot (30 sec). ""Making of The Eye"" (15 min) includes interviews with the cast, who talk about their characters, with producers Peter Ho-sun Chang and Lawrence Chang, who talk about the project, and with the Pang brothers, who talk about creating the big disaster scene.",1145145600,2,2496,4.8023255813953485
1909266,4,B0000AVHAO,"As I write this, it's been about a year since I saw the film. I enjoyed it and will buy it soon. Other reviews have told you the plot. My only criticism comes when the formerly-blind woman finds her way to a different floor, and she READS THE SIGN. If she's been blind since age two, reading signs is highly unlikely. Aside from that, this is a good story and a fun film.",1142467200,,371,4.095890410958904
1909267,3,B0000AVHAO,"For all those similar souls out there that just discovered the pleasures of asian horror cinema, The Eye will be a mix of ""what the hell"" and ""oh! Nice"".  Let me warn you, this is not a scary movie.  I don't know why is classified as one.  Neither is a horror one. At most, is a paranormal/ghost story.  Mum, a woman who has been blind since 2, just got a cornea transplant.  All is good until she start seeing things.  At the beginning you are with her in the ""am I seeing this or is just me getting use to eyesight?"" feeling. But all start to unravel.  You will see a lot of similarities with the 6th Sense. I don't know if this was on purpose.  The similarities are there but the movie stands alone on it's own merits.  Yes there is a moment where you expect someone to say ""I see dead people"" (But there is a scene where  Mum ask her psychologist ""how are you going to help me if you don't believe me?, and no, the guy is not a ghost).

Now, I must be fair, these similarities are few, and the movie is pretty original.  They hint of the problems of Mum adapting to be able to see, but they don't overexpose those problems.  They show you a few ghost, but their intentions are not to scare you, just to show you Mums psychological suffering, and a brief explanation of why some dead remain here is given in a simple casual asian-buddhist way in about 40 seconds.  When the movie reaches the last 30 minutes, you realize the real story, the pain of the cornea donor during her moments on Earth.  A poor girl who never understood why she have to see the future (by the way, it is implicit that the ""ability"" of foresight is in the eyes, not the person, that's why Mum got the powers).

So, is a good movie with a great ending (is one of those that you think is over and they keep going leaving you with the dread of things to come), who manages to leave a few surprises, and is able to catch you off guard.  But, I think that is better to rent before buying.  Asian horror is quite different, and it gets some to get use to it.  If you like Ringu, or some of her film relatives, you might enjoy it.  Once again, rent it, don't believe the hype you read here, be you own judge.",1136332800,2,2178,4.128266033254157

It sounds great when you read this, but when you watch the movie, it's long and boring.  The ending was not great either, so I did not spend my money very well renting this movie.  What drove me nuts was, this girl had an eye surgery, so whenever she sees a ghost it's all blurry.  This goes on and on.  When you do see some ghosts at the end, they really don't do anything, they just are there and you are just supposed to get spooked by them.  This movie reminded me of the movie that I also hated The Grudge.  The ending of this movie The Eye was very predictable and nothing special.  So, if you actually loved the movis The Grudge, then you might very well love this movie.  If you hated the movie The Grudge, then stay away from this long, boring and tedious to watch movie.

1909269,5,B0000AVHAO,"For a blind person, it would seem like a dream come true to have their sight restored. But what if it came with a price? That is the idea behind the Pang Brothers' ""The Eye"" (""Jian gui""), one of the most minimalistic -- and chilling -- horror movies in years.

Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee) has been blind since she was two, but a cornea transplant restores her sight. At first she can only see blurry figures. But then, Mun sees shadowy phantoms leading away the spirits of the dead. Even worse, she sees the ghosts of suicides lingering on, doomed to repeat their deaths until they are put to rest.

Horrified by this, she goes to her psychotherapist Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) for help. Stretching professional ethics, the lovestruck doctor manages to get the records of the donor, and they go to see her family in a rural village. And guided by dreams and visions, Mun learns of the tragic life of a girl, Ling, who could foresee death...

If you like serial killers, buckets of blood and screaming blondes in your horror movies, don't watch ""The Eye."" As a horror movie, it will be too subtle, too quiet, and too full of intelligent questions about life and death.

There are only a couple of real ""horror"" moments in here, where things look grotesque. Most of the time, it's psychological in nature; at one point, we hear that suicides are doomed to repeat their deaths -- it's horrifying enough to contemplate someone killing themselves, but doing it over and over? Even worse, we see this in action.

And the Pang Bros. handle this wonderfully. Many of the ghosts appear and vanish quickly, giving a shock to the audience; at other times, they explore the changes that sight brings to Mun's life. But at the same time, the Bros. add a softer side to this movie, such as Ling's reconciliation with her mother. It's a credit to the Bros. that this is touching, not syrupy.

A lot of the impact of the film can be credited to Lee and Chou. Lee especially, for showing a range of emotions, including joy, grief, hysteria and peaceful acceptance. Boyishly handsome Chou balances out Mun in a very believable, by merely being a pillar of strength and believing her seemingly crazy stories. The only flaw is that he seems to fall for her too quickly.

The DVD also comes with a very insightful featurette, which sheds a lot of light on the film's background and production. The actors talk about their characters, the directors talk about creating gas explosions and ghosts. And we hear from the people whose stories inspired the ghosts in this film, such as the guy standing in the highway.

With good acting and a really chilling script, ""The Eye"" is one of the rarest kinds of horror -- the kind that horrifies the mind, rather than the stomach. Mesmerizing and really spooky.",1132444800,,2775,4.626016260162602

Though horror fans will inevitably draw comparisons to such aesthetically similar efforts as The Sixth Sense and The Ring, The Eye stands well enough on its own by offering a stylishly rendered tale of terror and well-drawn, sympathetic characters. As Mun (Angelica Lee) struggles to adjust to a new world of sight and Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) attempts to assist her in expanding her visual vocabulary, the audience truly feels how disorienting it might be to suddenly experience the world in an entirely new context. Add in the supernatural visions that she suffers upon regaining her sight and her struggles to maintain her sanity amidst increasingly disturbing encounters, and the viewer gradually grows to experience Mun's plight in a remarkably personalized way. Additionally, the subsequent effect that the death of a minor but pivotal character has on Mun provides a well-drawn transition in her understanding of how her gift may be used. Clearly attracted to Mun, the protective Dr. Wah's ethical dilemma in contrast to his older and more professional uncle renders his conflicted character equally three-dimensional. well crafted put together remake.",1116460800,3,1406,5.513888888888889

I own this movie, and the ""Eye two"", both was exciting and both had great endings. In this movie the gost don't look like one of the ""Ju-on"" gost..But more like the gost we are use to seeing in the American movies..except, that since their dead, they are pale, and creepy. This movie is about a blind girl who have not seen the light since she was a little girl..then one day she was operated, and now has eyes that she could see the world with..

To her, it was the most exciting thing ever, to be able to look around and see things, you never seen before. The problem was that she did not distinquish, what was human, and what was not.

everywhere she look, she notice real creepy looking people.

But what bother her the most was that her family could not see them, or even the people walking around.

This story shows how she started to find out why she was seeing dead people, and what can she do about it to stop it..What she learn, with the help a her Dr. (whom by the way was falling in love with her) is that her eyes belong to a girl who commited suicide. and she found out that this girl also had powers to see into the future. A curse, that made the girl commit sucide.

like I said this movie is fantastic..but hey, am not going to tell all of the story..get it..and see what I mean..Then get the ""Eye Two"", because that one is also, fantastic.",1115164800,2,1381,4.192452830188679

1909277,4,B0000AVHAO,"""The Eye""is one of those films whose whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. Sometimes silly, oftentimes dull, other times, brilliant ""The Eye"" will surprise you every so often with a scene that is absolute magic.
Mun (Angelica Lee) has been blind her whole life, and by way of a corneal transplant she regains her sight.
Then her real problems begin. Because now she literally sees dead people...more specifically ghosts who, through a variety of reasons are unsettled in the afterlife or who have simply not been able to make that final crossover into death.
As you can imagine this is a bit discomforting for Mun. Is she insane? And why is that young lad with the cap continually accosting her outside of her apartment asking for his report card? She seeks help from a psychologist Wah (Laurence Chou) who, breaking every Hippocratic oath in the book, falls for her and though he is skeptical about her visions, helps Mun to find the cornea donor's family in Bangkok and hopefully uncover the evidence there to prove to her that she has not gone insane in the process of re-gaining her sight.
The scenes in Thailand are gorgeous and directors Pang and Chun have taken advantage of the natural beauty of Bangkok and created a creepy, doomed, mysterious mise en scene that adds to the suspenseful nature of Mun's and Wah's task.
""The Eye"" is pretty much redeemed by the scenes and action in Thailand and the directors keen and all-seeing eyes, like Hitchcock's have a knack for focusing on what is really scary: the everyday stuff of life...in this case the fat dripping off a bloody roasting chicken, a caf cook loudly and rapidly chopping up some pork or a bad light bulb twinkling in a darkly lit hallway.

1909278,5,B0000AVHAO,"In Oriental folklore, the eye is often a vehicle for the supernatural, and by proxy, horror.  From the one-eyed ghoul hero of ""Ge ge ge no Kitaro"" to Sadako's eye peering from her dark hair in ""Ringu,"" there is something inherently frightening about an eyeball. The Pang Brothers have taken this fearful organ and given us a rare glimpse of peering through someone else's eyes, seeing what they see, knowing what they know.

The story of ""The Eye""  (""Jian Gui"") is fairly straight forward.  Taking their cue from an actual event, lovely, blind violinist Wong Kar Mun has a corneal transplant, enabling her to see for the first time in her life.  She has no frame of reference for what vision should be, and the shadowy figures haunting the corners of her world are no less real than the people she talks too.  She doesn't even know what she looks like, and cannot recognize the face that looks back at her from the mirror.  Slowly but surely, she learns that her new eyes are not like everyone else's.  She has had a corneal transplant from a clairvoyant, one who could see ghosts and future events.  She is a textbook Cassandra, searching for answers and someone who will believe her.

One of the main differences between Western and Asian horror films is the reliance on special effects to give a chill or a scream.  Western films, with their larger budgets, tend to focus on visual shocks and well-crafted horrors, while Asian films tend to build atmosphere and tension through sheer craftsmanship.  ""The Eye' is an interesting blend of these two traditions, coming up with some first-class ghost effects while maintaining the feel of a low-budget creeper.  The combination is perfect, with the effects supplementing the craftsmanship and storytelling.  In fact, everything about this film works.

The DVD is excellent as well, with surround sound and featuring a fine ""Making of..."" documentary that highlights the factual stories that serve as the foundation of ""The Eye,"" as well as interviews with the directors and key cast members.",1108425600,2,2040,4.8895348837209305

this movie. ""The Eye"" is Asian suspense
cinema at its finest.
In my opinion,
what makes this film so great
is the credibility factor. There
aren't any monsters or overly vengeful
assasins with the outright purpose
of scaring you to death. Also, the
subject matter isn't so far fetched
that you can't relate to the characters.

Elements of terror and suspense

work their way effectively
through every scene
but never too much. There isn't excessive
violence or gore, just essential
creepiness that maintains your interest.

This movie is a quiet thriller
that gradually draws you into the story
and before you know it
chills are running up and down the spine
and goose pimples began to hang around
just a little longer than usual.
The lead actress is excellent
and you find yourself loving her and wanting
to help her.

""The Eye"" is a silent, creepy masterpiece.

Well the movie is about a girl named Mun (Angelica Lee) who has been blind for a while, and now she has dreams of being a ordinary person, and having eyesite, and Dr Wah(Lawrence Chou) grants her wish, but it's not the rainbow-style dream come true she expected.

Is it because the streets of China aren't a plesent site, is it because crappy rap artist like 50 cent are even visible in china, Nope, it's cuz the eyeballs are loaded with infinite rounds of the sixth sence.

It's pretty freaky, and the use of music when spirits show up is excellent.(Now I can see what inspired Fatal Frame II to have this kinda feel)

This movie is a good movie, not all original, but good non-the-less.  And it's pretty scary(Not scary enough for me to wet my pants like Fatal Frame 2(PS2) did)  If you like horror this should be checked out.

Rather than buy it, I decided to rent it first. I must admit that it was a tremendous disappointment. Some scenes had the potential to be developed into the frightening aspects the film allegedly contained, but they did not.

1909282,5,B0000AVHAO,"First of all, if you are looking for a crazy/all out/gore-packed/horror movie, step away from this one because you will not get any of that. However, if you are a fan of really creepy/under the skin/horror flicks, then you might be in for a little treat. The only thing that might set you back is the fact that this flick is almost like a combination of the Sixth Sense and Mothman Prophecies. Who ripped off who is not for me to say, or hey.. this just might be a coincidence. I cannot really tell, all I can say is that I lucked out and saw this flick before it was released.

The Eye is about a young blind girl named Mun who gets a cornea transplant which returns her sight that she has once lost. Shortly after she discovers that she is seeing a little bit more than she should, to be exact, she starts to see ghosts. Of course everyone is skeptical about what she tells them she sees because they all think that her eyes are just adjusting and that this is only a little glitch. However, Mun decides that she this is not something ordinary and that she has to solve this mystery that is haunting her on daily/nightly basis. She begins an investigation and tries to solve the puzzle of the death of her corneas' former owner who met her demise a long ago.

The film focuses roughly on getting under your skin, none of the in your face gorific elements are here to be seen. Only pure creepiness that is often too slow for an average movie goer. The first ten minutes of this movie is roughly what I am talking about. They are very creepy and it sets a great mood for the remainder of the movie. Although the people I went to see this flick with weren't too pleased with it, I think they'd still agree that this flick had a certain degree of creepiness to it that deserves to be mentioned, or seen",1105488000,6,1800,4.275659824046921
1909283,5,B0000AVHAO,"Including ""The Eye,"" I can think of only a handful of ghost films that are actually scary. ""The Changeling"" comes to mind, as does ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Ring."" Beyond those three--there might be one or two more--I'm having trouble coming up with further examples. Maybe ""The Sixth Sense"" counts for some people, but it ultimately fell short of the mark. There is something about Hollywood and ghosts that often doesn't work. Maybe Tinseltown's reliance on massive special effects and dumbed down scripts precludes them from grasping the subtle nuances necessary to achieve real chills. Having a guy wearing a hockey mask and carrying a machete jump out of a dark closet might elicit a jump or two, but it's a far cry from the feeling you get watching that ball bounce down the stairs in ""The Changeling."" Perhaps the fact that ""The Eye"" doesn't come from Hollywood accounts for its success. Whatever the case, this little film made by Oxide and Danny Pang is one heck of a rollercoaster ride. It's a deeply frightening movie that keeps the scares coming fast and furious, through both ghostly apparitions and sudden plot changes. No wonder Hollywood keeps buying up the rights to these Asian horror movies.

Mun (Angelica Lee) is an attractive young lady suffering from blindness. She's been blind since a very young age, but makes the most of a bad situation. Mun's disability does not hinder her life in significant ways; she plays a musical instrument with an all-blind symphony orchestra and gets along quite well with her grandmother and her beautiful if slightly icy airline stewardess sister. All of this is about to change, however, when an operation restores Mun's eyesight. What a wonderful, heartwarming story, right? Wrong. The nightmare begins as soon as the bandages come off. Mun starts seeing hazy figures that appear and disappear in the blink of an eye, and that's just for starters. As her vision improves she comes to the conclusion that she's seeing ghosts. She sees some in the hospital while she strikes up a friendship with a young cancer patient, she sees them in the hallway outside her room, and she sees them in her grandmother's apartment building. Mun also suffers from intense flashbacks of scenes she never witnessed herself, but it's the ghosts that reduce her to a shambling wreck. No one else notices these apparitions, let alone hears them like Mun does, and she begins to suffer from depression. Concerned that something about the operation didn't go well, Mun begins visiting a psychologist named Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) in an effort to get to the bottom of her affliction.

Wah initially expresses skepticism about Mun's claims, but in predictable movie fashion falls in love with the young lady. He agrees to help his charge uncover the mystery behind the sightings, not an easy task considering that the two must track down the person who donated the corneas for Mun's operation. Sure enough, the story behind the donation reeks of supernatural overtones. It turns out that Mun sports the corneas of a young psychic who lived in a small Thai village. None of the people in the hamlet liked the girl because her visions often foretold ominous events. Whenever a child passed away or a disaster unfolded, it would happen a few days after this girl talked about it. You would think after awhile the people would start listening to her, but such is not the case when superstition is involved. The other kids picked on this girl mercilessly, so much so that she decided to take her own life. Now Mun must figure out a way to purge the girl's gift and memory from her eyes. Is such a thing possible? It sure looks that way after Mun takes a stand in the girl's old bedroom. But things aren't as easy as they seem in ""The Eye,"" and the viewer learns this after watching the massively disturbing conclusion. It would seem that accepting what life throws your way is sometimes better than trying to change it.

""The Eye"" is a frightening film indeed. I think the movie scared me as much as it did because I kept putting myself in Mun's place. I can't even begin to imagine how utterly devastating it would be to regain your sight only to go through the things Mun witnesses. Remember, this is a person who has no memories of what the world looks like. The choice of Angelica Lee to play the lead character was a good one; she exudes a sort of innocence that is perfect for a person regaining their vision. That innocence soon turns to horror when the spirits turn up to torment her, and the various spirits Mun encounters are the best thing going for ""The Eye."" You just never know when they'll turn up. The most horrifying vision occurs when Mun practices her writing skills, with the floating spirit in the elevator pulling a close second. The filmmakers handle these scenes with great flair, allowing the camera plenty of time to capture the horror felt by Mun as the fear courses through her veins. An empty elevator never looked this ominous before!

The DVD comes with several extras, including trailers for ""The Housekeeper,"" ""Morvern Callar,"" and several from a series called ""The Director's Label."" A trailer for the film, a television spot, and an informative making of documentary flesh out the disc. Many of the behind the scenes featurettes on these discs bore me, but I liked the one here. It was neat to see how they pulled off the fiery finale. ""The Eye"" is yet another Asian horror film Hollywood plans on remaking sometime in the future. Let's hope against hope that they do this version justice.",1104278400,8,5554,4.758298755186722
1909284,1,B0000AVHAO,"Having rented the ""Eye"" late one night, I sat alone in my basement expecting to be scared, instead I was completely bored by this utter pretentious attempt at ""new wave"" horror. Riding the coattails of the average and overrated Jap film, ""Ring"", this attempts to be a follow up in some way but there is no connection whatsoever, except one of the ghosts was said to be in the ""Ring"". What wasn't outright stolen from American horror films, was badly imitated in a pointless and completely dull movie. I must say that there was not one scary moment in this film, not one! If you think then that it is a ""horror film"" then you are wrong, what the director does is sludge through one hour of the most inane dialogue while amateurish and incredulous actors walk around like boring idiots. Where did they get these people?

Most of these films would do better if there was some grasp of directorial and script effort but suffice it to say, this is a real stinker. Nearing the end, the film resorts to some cheap computer animation that is like watching a video game. Do not pay attention to the young teens who say this is the ""best horror film"" ever, rent something that has credibility, this is not it. I am angered that the Chinese get credit for an ""intelligent horror film"" when they only stole and re-hashed American/Hollywood genres. Check out the American version of the ""Ring"" or ""Seconds"" (1966) directed by John Frankenheimer, much more worthy efforts.",1102982400,3,1458,4.651162790697675

Along with the wonderous sights, she also begins to see mysterious shadows and ghosts.  Unsure if what she sees is real or imagined, she decides to track down information about whose corneas she received hoping that this will hold the key to her odd visions.

This movie sent shivers up and down my spine from the beginning.  A great story combined with expert direction by the Pang Brothers and effectively creepy music make quite an impresive horror film.  Angelica Lee plays the part of Mun perfectly, as the blind woman who regains her sight.  She cannot tell the difference between real people and ghosts, having never seen the distinction before, and Ms. Lee makes you feel sorry and frightened for her.  This film also contains one of the more frightening and tension-laden scenes since the shower seen in ""Psycho.""  (You'll think twice about entering an elevator by yourself again.)

1909286,5,B0000AVHAO,"I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this movie. The beautiful young actress who plays the lead created such a likable character that I felt immersed in her character's plight and confusion. The atmosphere of the film was perfect -- not forceful but subtle.  And the creep factor was definitely there! However, I found the movie also surprisingly touching. You feel that the character comes full circle but ends up with her eyes ""opened"" in an unexpected way. Very similar in theme to The Sixth Sense but, I felt, more satisfying somehow. I have to admit to some doubt when The Eye first started. I was a little thrown by the camera work, the shifting focus. I wasn't sure what to expect at that point. However, with one sweep of the hand, the opening credits began and I was immediately intrigued.  A great film to watch while you're alone at night, to get a full appreciation for the creep-factor and the suspense. A scene I could watch over and over again (and have) is the elevator scene. Deliciously done!  I may have second thoughts about being in an elevator again.  lol

If you're looking for cheap startle scares, gruesome f/x, and other such horror aspects (we) Americans seem accustomed to, you may wish to look elsewhere. However, if you are the type who can appreciate a fine, subtle touch of atmosphere, suspense, character and situations then you may find The Eye very much to your liking. As a heads-up, the movie has English subtitles but does not have any English dubbed soundtrack. A plus in my book! Nothing could ruin a suspenseful movie faster than bad dubbing and, for me, there's no such thing as ""good"" dubbing.  ;-)",1102636800,6,1641,4.700348432055749

Made in Honk Kong and Thailand by the Pang brothers, the film was a huge success in Asia.  Of course, Asian horror films (Ringu, The Grudge) are popular now in America as well, perhaps because of (or despite?) their emphasis on atmosphere over gruesome special effects.  ""The Eye"" is certainly in that vein, with many people comparing it to ""Ringu"" and its American remake ""The Ring.""

Unfortunately, ""The Eye"" does not have a particularly novel plot.  In addition, the pace plods slowly, preventing real tension from building.  I was never particularly scared during the movie, although a few scenes were well-imagined.  Overall, ""The Eye"" is a decent but unspectacular Asian thriller that will be enjoyed most by those who like their horror flicks simple and moody.

The movie is in Japanese with subtitles but this soon was no longer a bother because the atmosphere overshadows the dialogue and actually adds a bit of mystique to the film.  It is not a Hollywood version of a film; it is the original, shot from a different perspective.  And it's a terrific film.

A woman, blind since age two, recovers her sight through a transplant operation and finds out that along with a new set of physical eyes, she receives much more.  The premise is trippy enough - imagine not having a vocabulary to describe what you see - but bizarre things begin happening that she can't explain.

The dialogue is not very deep but the story itself is woven tightly so it adds to the visuals of the film.  While not special effects laden, there are enough effects that are just plain creepy.  I haven't been held in suspense like this for a long time as most 'horror' films are pretty formula anymore.  This one, happily, bucks the mold a bit.

A visual treat, one that stays intense throughout.

1909292,4,B0000AVHAO,"Imagine for a moment that you've been blind since the age of two, submerged in a world of darkness. You crave, hunger for, the simplest, most elementary of optical stimulation.

Then, one day, you are the lucky beneficiary of a highly experimental corneal operation. You see the glorious colors of a world that for far too long was lost in the inky black. Buildings, interiors of rooms, the golden infinity of a sunrise, human faces---all of these things that have been denied you for more than a decade. There's one catch.

Now, you see the Dead. Worse still, you see the Unquiet Dead---and those dark-shrouded, pale-faced creatures of Darkness sent to collect them and shepherd them to their final resting place.

In a sentence, ""The Eye"" is about those dark, skulking, cold-skinned dead things that most of us (mercifully) can't see. Our heroine Mun(played sympathetically by Malay rocker Angelica Lee) regains her sight, but there's a downside. With vision comes horrific visions of the Dead: a whining boy wondering if Mun has seen his report card, an elderly man standing stiff in the middle of a Hong Kong highway, a disfigured phantom floating in the elevator car.

There is a mystery at the center of ""The Eye"", but in truth the exposition and detective-work required to explain it weakens the impact of the film, which at its dark heart is a long twisted song to the horror that hides in the closet and sleeps underneath the bed of terrified children. Mun and her psychotherapist Dr. Wah (played with aplomb by the youthful Lawrence Chou) are quick to depart on a mystery-hunt that takes them to the wilds of Thailand, but the mystery itself isn't the attraction here: quite the contrary, the ghoulish spooky delights found in ""The Eye"" beg not to be explained.

For most of the film's running time, the Pang Brothers defy explanation, preferring to steep the viewer in the movie's delicious, ghoulishly creepy atmosphere. But as with most Asian horror, an explanation must always be tendered, and this one doesn't serve the film's shivery nature: the resolution is disappointing, particularly given the terrors that preceded it.

That said, ""The Eye"" is the first film in years to have genuinely creeped me out. The scene in an apartment elevator car is by itself worth the price of admission. ""The Eye"" doesn't pack the same brutal whallop of terror provided by films like ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On"", but it's a shivery and competently executed little chiller on its own terms. Watched in total darkness in an empty house on a rainy night, the effect of ""The Eye"" is equivalent to having walked into your closet, confident nothing but your clothes resides there, only to feel a graveyard-cold hand brush against your face.",1098921600,14,2727,4.891774891774892

It has nothing remotely similar to the Japanese film ""Ringu"" as mentioned by other reviewers. There is no comparison except the 'horror film' aspect.

But it turns out that the corneas came from a woman with the gift of clairvoyance. You can figure out the rest. The story plays out in a fairly predictable way .... but there is one unexpected climactic scene that really blew me away and took the story to a whole new level.

Although ""6th Sense"" and ""Devil's Backbone"" compare well in terms of overall quality, ""The Eye"" dominates in terms of scariness and jolting shocks, blasting the viewer with major, utterly chilling shocks right out of nowhere and Sixth Sense-level twists throughout the movie, not just at the end.

  Combining darkness and wonder like few others, ""The Eye"" focuses on a blind woman suddenly able to not only see but to see spirits after undergoing a cornea transplant operation, including both innocent and highly unfriendly spirits.

Though this movie hints at the same premises of, ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is NOT the same movie.  This movie is very fresh, surprising and genuinely creepy.  Well worth reading subtitles even if subtitles are not your cup of tea.

Given the limited dialogue, the main character ""Mun,"" is played by a fine actress who adds depth to the character with the tense yet suble fear in her eyes, the carriage of her body and the modulation of her voice.  Though I could not understand the language, it was well worth having the volume up for the full experience of her acting.

I have been waiting patiently, then impatiently, for a movie to scare me as much as, ""The Sixth Sense,"" and, ""Stir of Echoes.""  I was almost impressed with ""The Butterfly Effect,"" which I would even rate four stars, but ""The Eye"" is simply much better.

Other than that, it's yet another pathetic ripoff of Sixth Sense, but without any character development.  It did have a good and somewhat unsettling beginning, but once you understood everything, it could all be summed up in this little equation:

Ghost + Sixth Sense = The Eye.

 Yep, that's right. Ghost, that old Patrick Swayze movie.  Maybe someone should actually explain what this movie is about instead of saying ""it's so creepy"", so here you go, the key points to what this movie actually is: (don't worry, no spoilers yet)

2. Girl Sees Dead People Now

3. Girl Sees ""Shadow Things"" Taking Away Dead People To LaLa Land

4. Girl Freaks Out With Each New Dead Person Encounter

5. Girl Suddenly Sixth Senses Her Way To The End

6. Big Extra Ending Scene To Make The Movie Feel More Special

That's the entire movie. Now, you can take any movie and outline it like this and it will seem just as boring, but it's the filling, acting, characters, F/X, and pace that make a movie like this good.  This one didn't have any of those worth mentioning.

I HAVE to mention this since it was too funny not to share:

The scene where she looks in the mirror and sees it's not herself and freaks out...I had to rewind and look about 3 times to realize it wasn't her! :)  Umm...sorry to stereotype, but they COULD have chosen an actress who didn't look almost the EXACT same as the lead actress, even the hair looked the same!  As the movie dragged on, I could sort of tell them apart, but seriously, I had a hard time knowing (or caring) which one was which.

America, PLEASE do this lame movie justice (I think it mentioned on the DVD back that Tom Cruise's ""studio"" bought the rights to remake it).

Oh wow, the music got faster and stuff started to fade away back and forth(gets annoying), real scary and psychologically challenging. Too many modern Hollywood Supernatural movie cliches that left me uninterested. I already knew what was going to happen at the end too. It was way too similar to the ending in Mothman Prophecies (which was a decent film). The movie shouldn't even be rated R, more like a PG movie. I felt like I was watching a bad epidsode of ""Are you Afraid of the Dark?"", you know that old Nickelodeon show. If you're interested in this movie because you thought it's different from all the hollywood horror trash, don't even bother. That's all this movie is, except it's from Asia.

The American version of The Ring had seriously scared me, and the Japanese version creeped me out to a large degree as well, but this movie has no creepiness, no darkness, no impending horror about it. I mean, the ghosts had no qualities to them, save a monotonous voice that repeats the same words and slogans over and over again. Plus, The Ring and The Sixth Sense (it doesn't matter how you put it, this movie ripped off the Sixth Sense something fierce) have decent, shocking endings, whereas it seems that this movie did not know what to do with itself.

1909312,5,B0000AVHAO,"After the worldwide success of The Ring a few years back many Asian horror titles were given the go-ahead by larger production companies.  No longer confined to lower budgets some of these titles, especially out of the Japanese market, have looked slicker and slicker.  The Eye, a high budget horror fest from Hong Kong, managed to eclipse just about all of the many Asian horror films I've witnessed in recent years.
The story centers around a young woman by the name of Wong Kar Mun.  Her age is not revealed but she appears to be in her early twenties.  Mun lost her sight at the age of two and has been living in the dark ever since.  Mun decides to have a cornea transplant in an attempt to regain her sight.  At first, the operation appears successful.  Although images appear somewhat blurry, she is able to see the outside world as it is meant to be seen.  Except for one major difference; she also sees people others don't see, dead people soon before they actually die.
It seems like a pretty routine storyline as far as Asian horror films go but it's the competent direction of this film and the effective scare devices that make The Eye such a winner.  This one is a major spookfest; Mun's character is developed so well and we are made to sympathise with her so much that we can't bare it to see her in pain and peril.  Spooky visuals abound such as ghosts that jump at Mun unexpectedly and genuinely frightening set pieces such as a scene in an elevator that had me cringing in my seat.  Of particular note is the way that sound is used to scare the viewer.  The audio track is filled with jumps in tone and eerie sounds.  But The Eye is more than just a claustrophobic creepfest, it turns into an adventure film.  After Mun discovers that something is seriously wrong with her transplant, she leaves Hong Kong and sets out into the jungles of Thailand in an effort to locate the cornea donor.  It is in Thailand that Mun will learn the shocking revelations behind her donor's past.
Of course comparisons with The Sixth Sense are inevitable but The Eye is way better.  It has a similar concept but makes away with the gimmick ending and replaces Joel Haley Osmond with a beautiful Chinese woman.  This film is so good I ended up calling some of my horror movie watching friends and begging them to watch this, something I would rarely ever do.  Of interesting note is a mention on the back of the DVD cover box that says that Tom Cruise's production company has quickly picked up the rights to film a U.S. remake.  Why?  I don't see how anyone could possibly ever improve on this film.  ""The Ring"" was improved on, I actually felt the remake was better but that's different.  The original version, while telling a great story, was plagued by a low budget, limited special effects and shoddy pacing.  The Eye has none of those problems.  Whether the remake ever cuts it or not at least I know I'll always have the original and that is a very good thing.",1079222400,4,2966,4.470260223048327

This woman who has been blind since age 2, recieves cornea transplants and slowly (and wonderfully) fuzzily regains her sight. The problem is...now she sees dead people...everywhere. Lost souls, much like in previously mentioned ""Sixth Sense"", that are lost and sometimes pissed off, parade through here though, rather than trickle, and the filmmakers do a terrific job making each one creepier than the last. When even to get into her apartment, she knows shes gonna encounter the neighbor's dead son every single time, she figures out something has gotta give here. The triumph lasts till the midway shock of the film (which I will not even begin to reveal here, but do yourself a favor and don't read the description on the DVD case), and then turns into a ""The Ring""-ish hunt for the past and the woman who the eyes came from. Even with a somewhat slow moving third act, after its pseudo-conclusion, it is made up for with a power-punch big effects ending that was very well-done to say the least.

1909316,5,B0000AVHAO,"First of all I am a huge fan of not only asian cinema, but also of horror films. After first hearing of this film a couple weeks ago I decided to go ahead and pick it up. I figured it sounded cool. Now you have to realize that although I'm a fan of horror films, I'm really not someone who gets scared of horror films. I mean when I saw The Exorcist, supposedly ""The scariest movie ever made"", I literally laughed and said, ""That's it?"" I mean it didn't scare me at all, it wasn't creepy at all, it was built up to be such a scary movie and to me it was a big joke. So it came as quite a shock to me that when I finally saw The Eye, it scared the crap out of me! This film doesn't rely on sudden scares or things that make you jump, nor does it rely on gore, what this film does and does better than any movie I've seen is get under your skin! I got goosebumps so many times over the course of this movie and even a couple times caught myself saying aloud ""I hate this movie!"" as I'm curled up in a ball with my blanket over my mouth, painfully awaiting what's going to happen next. I really don't want to give anything away by going into more detail, and in fact if you've never seen the trailer for the film, do yourself a favor and don't watch it before you watch the movie. I luckily chose this route and when I did watch the trailer after seeing the film, I was glad I did it in that order. Some of the creepier moments in the film are revealed in the trailer which although good for marketing, I'd think would somewhat ruin the impact the film has on a audience.
Anyway I've rambled enough here. Just do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie. You'll be glad you did.",1077408000,5,1680,4.017910447761194

Realizing she's seeing the dead, Mun and her doctor become determined to help her find the donor of the corneas.
The ideas behind this film are much better than the execution. The creators, the Pang brothers, have a tremendous visual sense so the screen compositions are often extraordinary. But oddly enough in a film where so much depends on seeing what the heroine sees, the film suffers from weak shot-to-shot continuity: often you're not quite sure what Mun sees as she sees it, which makes thematic sense given her own trouble believing and understanding her visions but that greatly interferes with the suspense. Only afterwards do you realize how frightening the sequence MIGHT have been had it only been edited slightly differently and with a different kind of kinetic rhythm: in the restaurant scene, in the elevator scene, and even in the crucial bedroom scene in Thailand near the end. Only the sequence in the hospital hallway near the beginning and the great scene in the calligraphy classroom seem to achieve the effects the filmmakers intended.",1074124800,4,1280,4.985981308411215
1909318,4,B0000AVHAO,"The Eye (The Pang Brothers, 2002)
In case you were thinking about entering the World's Coolest Name contest, don't bother. Oxide Pang has the title sewn up. He also, along with his brother Danny, makes very interesting films out of a studio in Hong Kong. First coming to Western attention with the crime thriller Bangkok Dangerous a few years ago, the twins came up with a horror film this time. And it's one of the best horror films to come down the pike in a long time.
Mun, a blind girl (Angelica Lee, who caught Western attention a couple of years back in Betelnut Beauty), has a cornea transplant to restore her sight. While in the process of recovery, she starts seeing things that don't quite gel with reality. After she regains focus, she comes to realize what she's seeing is not exactly what's out there. Not just ghosts (though the movie has its share of those, a la The Sixth Sense), but places and things that aren't actually around her. Her therapist, Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou, not familiar to Western audiences yet. Give him time), half thinks she's nuts, half wants to get her into bed, so he goes along with her attempts to track down the donor of her corneas and find out what happened to the person.
Slick, eerie, and chock full of tension, The Eye is exactly what thrillers are supposed to be. There is a lot of The Sixth Sense in this movie, but the punches are delivered more deftly; the movie contains the best jump-out-of-your-seat scene since the cat came flying through the window at the beginning of Friday the 13th Part 2 twenty years ago. Asian directors also seem immune to the silly emotionally manipulative tricks American directors are so fond of pulling, and the Pang brothers are no exception; they have a story, they want to tell it, and the emotion will come out (though sometimes awkwardly, as when Wah's uncle confronts him about his intentions towards Mun).
Apart from such unintentionally funny moments as this, The Eye is a wonderful little supernatural thriller. Very highly recommended. ****",1072051200,11,2033,4.713483146067416

1909321,5,B0000AVHAO,"This is the scariest movie I have seen in a long while, and more so since I made the 'unwise' decision to watch it close to midnight with the lights switched off..I can only say that I found it very hard to fall asleep after that. Still,thinking about it now sends shivers down my spine,something very few horror films managed to achieve.
The subject itself is not original,the 'supernatural eyes' have been treated extensively on the big screen ,from Eyes of Laura Mars, Jennifer 8, The Gift, Afraid of Dark ,Final Destination, and many others in cinema and TV,but the lack of originality is in no way a hinderance to creativity and making an excellent film.
The Pang brothers,(the Coen Brothers of China) manage to weave an old genre into their unique style,adding a lot of Chinese 'ghost folklore',alledgedly true accounts, and a reworking of a real life tragedy, the gas explosion on a busy motorway.
The closet film that can be associated with The Eye is of course the Sixth Sense and its famous line' I can see dead people'.Though Shyamalan's version was excellent and scary, it lacked this raw,relentless and intense tension that will grip you the very second The Eye starts.
A blind woman (the excellent and pretty Angelica Lee, who does a great job at never falling in the trap of 'overacting' that many a horror actress had fallen in), gets eyes transplant and sees for the first time since she was two years old. Not only the familiar shapes and people, but also the sinister and scary from another realm, and at first she naturally can't distinguish between the two.
From then on and through her new eyes we are shocked and terrified with the tormented souls of the dead she sees quite often, some disturbing like the ever present and shadowy grim reaper,and the boy who committed suicide, but others with some hope,like the little girl who befriends Lee in the hospital before she dies.
At the end she traces the identity and address of the donor of her eyes,with the help of her smitten young doctor,and manages to ease her donor's tormented soul. This,she believes will relieve her from seeing these ghosts,and it does, but with a twist of genuis by the Pang brothers, there is another gift hidden in her eyes that is as disturbing. The very last scene of the movie, which I will not disclose,is very powerful!
There are other very disturbing scenes: the one in  the lift is one of the scariest I have seen,(you have to see it to know what I am talking about), while the one where Lee plays the violin is touching and quite unforgettable.
The romance between Lee and her young doctor is very well treated and not cheesy as some reviewer saw it. Their relationship is veered more towards a friendship born out of an urgent need that might develop further,(indeed they sleep in seperate rooms when they stay in the donor's house and their love is never 'consumated')
Now a word about editing: it is largely overlooked when reviewing movies, but especially in horror films,it is a absolute vital component in making or breaking the film. The Pangs, who did the editing as well as cowriting,successfully make the right cuts at the right moment, increasing the tension greatly.
As is written on the DVD backcover, Tom Cruise's production company has already bought the remake rights, so I guess it will not be too long before an American version hit the screen. I just hope that it will not be a scene by scene copy as is the tradition with many Hollywood adaptations of foreign classics,or even include (God Help us all),a sex scene or two, but rather I hope it remains faithful to the creativity behind The Eye.
To advise you not to switch the lights off while watching it would be wise but somehow not quite right(like putting  Vivaldi in a pub's jukebox at Happy Hour!),as there is a sort of ritual and mood to watch horror films, but you have been warned:
The Eye will genuinely scare you!

1909323,2,B0000AVHAO,"I was hoping 'The Eye' was going to be fresh filmmaking and would bring something new to the overly cliche Horror/Mystery genre.  This film has been recommended to me several times by others, and the reviews it's been getting by critics have been over the top.  I was left unfulfilled and severely disappointed by the time the end credits rolled on screen.  In fact, the film hardly leaves me any desire to see the newly rewritten Hollywood version next year.
There are a lot of problems with 'The Eye'.  The pacing seems oddly clunkish at times.  I was hoping the story would take off within the first 30 minutes, but it never actually does.  See, I'm not going to rag on the small problems, like having to believe that the main character can see AND hear dead people after her corneal transplant, because there is so much more.  Few of the moments that are SUPPOSED to be scary are not because none of the moments prior to the scare get built up enough.  Then the audience has to put up with a very sappy (romance?) between the main character and her doctor.  Outside the hospital sequences, the script never really found anything interesting for the doctor to do.
What I did like about 'The Eye' was the main character's connection with the corneal donor.  That and the cinematography was decent.  But besides all that, the editing was rather poor and the musical score wasn't really suited for a horror film.

It is successful and she can now see the world around her.  But the transplant has an unexpected side effect, she can see dead people.  The Eye is an eerie and extremely effective ghost story.  The theme is similar the Sixth Sense, but I would not consider it to be a copy, but more of a compliment to the ideas presented in that film.  The muted colors of the film give it a cold and creepy atmosphere.  Scares are accomplished with unsettling and disturbing visuals instead of shock and gore.  Characters are well established and you find yourself caring for the poor girl who gets the spooky vision.  The events build up to a good conclusion and an ending with a twist.
The picture and sound quality of the DVD are good.  Effective use of surround sounds on the Dolby 5.1 track adds to the scary tone of the movie.  The language track is Mandarin Chinese with English sub-titles.  There is no English language track as this movie was made for the Asian market.  The picture is sharp and presented in widescreen format.  Some of the plot elements are clich and predictable, but the movie is genuinely creepy.  I've seen so many horror films that I am pleasantly surprised when a movie can make the hair on my arms stand up.

1909328,5,B0000AVHAO,"It was just another boring day in Mid June. Me and my friend stumbled upon a movie poster that looked very interesting..We decided to give it a shot...not even 5 minites into the film, I got my first suprise. the sighting of what seemed like the film melted and the film was over before it even started. Not even 5 seconds later, you hear this horrible murderous scream that almost literally scared the Sh** out of me. The film is filled with shocking and terrifying moments. This film was so creepy, even 3 guys ran out of the theater scared out of their minds. This film doesn't rely on special effects to grab the viewers attention, just pure freaky moments. It's mostly the anticipation that scared most people in this film. I have the overseas Hong Kong version DVD i bought not even a week after i saw it. I'd recommend the American version because some overseas DVD's won't play in american dvd players... This is the creepiest film I've EVER seen...Definitely worth buying!!!!",1067472000,10,984,4.660919540229885
1909329,5,B0000AVHAO,"A young Chinese violinist, blind since childhood, recieves corneal transplants and begins seeing ghosts and other troubling visions.  She starts freaking out until she winds up back in the hospital with a collapse. Only then does anyone begin to believe her. Her psychotherapist (who has fallen for her) agrees to help her and traces the donor to a Thailand village where they discover the donor was an extremely troubled girl who committed suicide. She was psychic and persecuted by ignorant villagers. Resolving the matter will be another issue. ""The Eye"" is a richly textured supernatural thriller with horror elements. The ghosts are believable and the heroine's plight is scarily presented. There's enough tension in this film to fill Shea stadium. Yet it is also a film of emotional depth and treats the subject matter with respect. It says that there are ghosts all around us and those that can see them for whatever reason should understand the reasons they're still here. In ""The Eye"", it's tragedy and unresolved emotional conflict that binds a troubled spirit (and some others as well) to this plane. Whether you're a believer or not, ""The Eye"" is a good thought provoker and a well made thriller with enough scares and disturbing images to give you nightmares. At it's core, it's a sensitive treatment of what could happen with our advanced approaches in organ transplants and the misguided beliefs that everything is either black or white. But there are shades of grey that most people choose to ignore. ""The Eye"" explores these ""grey areas"" very well. As it says in the film, ""The world is a beautiful place""...as long as you don't look too close. You may see a ghost.",1067472000,7,1682,4.922535211267606
1909330,4,B0000AVHAO,"A Hong Kong flick with an actual plot...!  What will they think of next??  There are some creepy thrills in this fine, low-budget horror flick about a young Chinese woman who gets a cornea transplant to cure her lifelong blindness... and then goes all Haley Joel Osment and discovers she can see dead people!!  Fortunately her cute psychologist boyfriend believes her crazy tale, and eventually they get to the bottom of the whole haunted eyeball thing.  The film is genuinely unnerving, with several good ghosty sequences, and a reasonably coherent plot... Notably, it's the *sound design*  that gives this film most of its dramatic punch... Definitely worth checking out!",1067299200,4,673,5.137614678899083
1909331,4,B0000AVHAO,"THE EYE (Lion's Gate), is a terrific Asian thriller about a blind girl who gets an eye transplant and is able to see -- ghosts.

7997860,4,B0000AVHAO,"I like this movie. Its slow at the beginning but creepy esp. at the end (graphic effect seems SO REAL & excellent) it could happened in real life. However, I asks myself if this movie was film in china or Thailand ( I just read wiki, it was film in thai). I noticed their scribble language in some billboard. I also noticed the Chinese language/symbol. Its almost the same plot as Jessica alba movie except the place, culture, and the actors. I'm craving to watch foreign movie this whole week.",1429747200,,494,4.5
