2011438,5,B0001L11MO,"Absolutely astounding movie...theater on film at it's best. The amazing Amanda Plummer outshines herself, Ellen Burstyn, Mark Blum...the entire ensemble cast is a sheer pleasure to watch.

Families and their inheritances. The burdens we bear for our children and our parents' parents. Painful subjects played with humor, humor borders on tragedy, tragedy gives way to laughter. About how we torture those we love because we love them, are afraid for them and are afraid of them. How we torture those who have tortured us because they love us, have hurt us and are afraid of us and we want so desperately to have their love and so we torture them because they are not capable of giving it. So it goes, on and on.

Yet, in the end, it is Love that relentlessly tips the scales.",1408579200,6,775,4.6911764705882355

2011441,4,B0001L11MO,"Most people watch this movie and take it for face value. This is not that type of movie to do that with. This movie is so beautiful and funny, even heartbreaking at times. There's only about ten people throughout the entire movie if you don't count the background actors and it's very obviously a film adaptation of a play. All I can say is this movie gets a bum rap when in fact it's absolutely amazing.",1362960000,10,404,4.328947368421052

2011453,1,B0001L11MO,"We were looking for a smart family drama to watch over the holidays. This isn't it.

It's really, really, awesomely  bad...unless you're an actor or director studying how *not* to convert a stage play into a movie.

YOU CAN THANK ME LATER is an interesting theatrical curio --but **only** if you're involved with theatre. The directing's so c. 1980s stagey and unnatural --despite two of the greatest film actors still working today-- that you're really watching a ho-hum play that's been train wrecked into a stiff, unnatural, stagey film. While there are some rare moments of OK acting, everything feels artificial. Nearly all the lines and gestures, even how the actors enter rooms have zero to do with film and everything to do with theatre. Blame it all on the director. Bad choices piled up on great actors, through no fault of their own...as their other great movies prove.

At first, I was thrilled to find this intense but extremely stagey-clunky movie, because Ellyn Burstyn [ THE FOUNTAIN, INTERSTELLAR, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, Scorsese classic ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, RESURRECTION and THE EXORCIST ] and Amanda Plummer [PULP FICTION, FISHER KING, HUNGER GAMES]  are two of the great talents of American cinema. Ever!  Burstyn and Plummer can do anything; they're genius talents that didn't start out as pageant contestants or pole dancers, but in theatre.  But here, they're directed so badly, it's tough to watch as a movie.",1479945600,,1445,5.02092050209205
2011454,3,B0001L11MO,"The movie takes place in a hospital room, where all of the children gather with their mother, waiting to hear the prognosis of the father.  The family dynamics are looked at from the point of view of each adult child, with flashbacks into their pasts and the role their controlling mother had in making them who they are in the present.  It reminds me of a Woody Allen movie - good dialogue with bizarre behavior.",1477180800,2,413,4.493333333333333

8013934,3,B0001L11MO,"A movie about a dysfunctional family that has a death is not funny.  In fact, it was pitifully sad at times to see these character be in such emotional pain.  There were scenes that look more as if I was watching a play than a movie.",1500508800,,233,4.043478260869565
8013935,4,B0001L11MO,"This high-quality shoestring budget movie represents the new trend in cinema.
With paid streaming services, these entertaining well-done low-budget movies are all over the place. It's the third one I had seen this week. All of them have been enjoyable to watch including this one about a dysfunctional family. The low-budget movie is changing today the face of cinema. Less is more: minimalism is starring on the silver screen.",1499644800,,427,5.202898550724638
8013936,2,B0001L11MO,"I found it quite disappointing.  I wouldn't put this in a comedy category at all...more an awkward drama with attempts at humor.  It didn't find it touching or heartwarming at all.  I never felt like any of the actors connected.  The character I liked the most was the patriarch and he was never shown and died at the end.  I usually enjoy Ellen Burstyn...but not in this movie.

For those who enjoyed the movie...good for you!  I encourage you to write your review...and not tell me that my opinion is wrong.  We all have different tastes in movies...and that's why we have so many to choose from.",1499472000,,598,4.5233644859813085
