3564312,4,B001F6GWSC,"The synopsis and, in the main, other's reviews, are correct; the film is a polemic of sorts. But unless you're watching it to reinforce end your political view, they do stay WELL within the current reality. There is a sort of dry mouth reflex depending on with whom you identify; the interrogators are motivated not by individual animus, rather, by their sense of duty. The suspects as it develops may well be the naifs, but they are not innocents. I suspect this troubles some reviewers.  The cutting back and forth between the US and Chinese locations with their almost identical dialogue used by both interrogators is an effectively delivered message.  Much better than ""Closetland.""",1301702400,,686,5.008771929824562
3564313,2,B001F6GWSC,"A very poor attempt from the ""Moonbat"" left, in my opinion, at making a political statement. Only a follower would enjoy this one. It is a bit Michael Moorish. If it were not for Maggie, I wouldn't have finished watching and wouldn't have rated it as high. In all honesty, I will pass it on to other Maggie fans, in the hopes it won't be returned. Thank you HBO for putting the kibosh on this one.
 In reference to other reviews; Cheney and Bush? Now that's funny. :-)",1260316800,4,468,4.318181818181818
3564314,4,B001F6GWSC,"An American woman in China and an Arab man in the United States are both arrested on espionage charges.  Almost exactly the same dialog is used for both.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the American woman in China, and Glenn Close plays the interrogator in the U.S.  This movie is depressing, but I'm rating it a four because Maggie is nude for half of her scenes.",1258416000,,357,4.546875
3564315,3,B001F6GWSC,"""Strip Search"" is too short to be called a movie; it is more like a 55-minute political tract. I had read somewhere that HBO aired it for a few days before pulling it. At first this seems surprising, given its pedigree; it is directed by Sidney Lumet, and stars Glenn Close and Maggie Gyllenhaal.  One suspects that HBO didn't get wind of the film's content until it was too late; but given the stature of Lumet, it felt compelled to give it a token airing. It did, oddly enough, turn-up on this Portuguese DVD.

  Was the film really that ""bad""? Well, it depends on your definition of bad. The intentions certainly were not. It seems that Lumet, who has made a career of making socially and politically-charged movies, wanted to make a statement condemning national paranoia and ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" and that it is hypocritical that we condemn in other countries what we are doing in this country and abroad. Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo comes to mind, but it happens right here in this country.  Jose Padilla--who had been jailed for years without charge until federal prosecutors were essentially forced to make one up--had been tortured into a piece of insensible flesh, and believed that even his own lawyers were just another part of the ""interrogation"" team. The jury that convicted him apparently  saw only a sullen, unresponsive -and ""obviously"" guilty--individual.

  The plot of this film is simple enough: two concurrent episodes that tell essentially the same story, one occurring in China, the other in the United States. A female American student  (Gyllenhaal) is taken into custody by Chinese authorities for interrogation by a male operative, without an apparent charge. She is asked to identify a man accused of being a ""terrorist,"" who she first denies knowing. There is a discussion concerning human rights, dissent, etc. Her counterpart is a male Arab student in the U.S., who is taken into custody and interrogated by a female operative (Close) for the same reason. The gimmick is that each detainee and  interrogator says exactly the same thing word-for-word. Get it? What we do is no different from what they do.

  This film is called ""Strip Search"" for a reason. It doesn't take long for the interrogators to resort to shaming the detainees by forcing them to strip down to their birthday suits. When this is not sufficient to make them cooperative, the detainees are subjected to a modified version of a full cavity search--male-on-female, female-on-male; nothing particularly graphic is shown, but you know what is going on. All this is done with the apparent complicity of each detainees' embassy: ""I didn't know they were even here"" winks the embassy functionary as he ducks out the backdoor.

  On one hand, this is in-your-face political activism. On the other hand, it is sure to offend Chinese officials and the American right, and viewers who only see the gratuitousness and not the message. Only recommended for true believers--and those who refuse to believe that Bush-era abuses were less heinous than what ""they"" did.",1246406400,13,3069,5.00984251968504
8301090,1,B001F6GWSC,"This is propaganda. Here's the difference, Americans aren't overseas blowing up stuff and killing people as terrorists. That can't be said for here at home in the U.S..",1525219200,,168,5.035714285714286
8301091,2,B001F6GWSC,"The only 'controversy' is that it's a highly political statement made in the context of post-911 concerns about privacy and authoritarian impulses. It is somewhat entertaining and well-acted; but remains a condescending lecture about political morality and the difficulty in balancing the pampered citizen's rights vs the need for strong national security during times of war. It's more presumptuous than a standard empathy allegory used by therapists and educators; it's actually Sensitivity Training for those willing to endure a few inconveniences in order to have a safer future for their children.

If the story was told by just one side (say the Arab man confronted by the white woman, in what appears to be America), the point would be lost on many. The direction drives the allegory home by portraying a parallel tale about a white American girl in what appears to be North Korea. Both are subjected to the same treatment at the hand of opposite sex captors, being informed that they are 'detained' with questions.
After some intrusive questions and minor humiliation tactics, the suspects snapped like twigs. They broke too easily, which leads the viewer to wonder...were they actually guilty?

The film brilliantly uses parallel stories to illustrate several liberal/progressive political issues:
-It is anti-profiling (despite the evidence that it works, people would rather have 90 yo women searched by TSA in airports)
-It is anti-torture (suspects were exposed to very low level forms of deprivation; nothing that would constitute torture, though they want you to believe the characters felt that way).
-It bemoans the lack of due process in such situations (though I doubt you'll see any films supporting men who were denied due process after losing their careers and families because they were accused of sex assault by lying women)
-It hints at government betraying it's citizen's rights in order to obtain substantial rewards (fantasy vs tin foil hat fiction?)
-A strip search is the ultimate form of humiliation on Earth (the man was hardly touched!)
-Security entities will use any means necessary to achieve results, regardless of the consequences to the suspect (most follow strict protocols)
-Heightened security means that innocent people will constantly be harassed (only those who are guilty or associate with the guilty; again, a fair trade for a safer society).
-Snooping through my things hurts my feelings, even if I am the suspect in an investigation (boohoo!)
-Afterwards, the interrogator feels guilty or uncertain about the value of their work  (because they have feelings too!)

Maybe I'm not as American as other viewers, but I don't mind being questioned if I did nothing wrong, other than the time being wasted. There seems to be an element of American love of 'freedom' (a vacuous term if there ever was, as the astute young Asian man pointed out) that some understand in the context of our Constitution; others as a barrier to disrespecting authority (especially cops) and an insult to their sheltered lifestyles and parental issues (""you can't tell me what to do"", ""you ain't the boss of me!"").

To the old hippie teacher asking kids questions. Yeah, I would give my life to guarantee the total safety of my nation forever. It's worth more than selfish 'freedoms', material concerns, or any other moral principles.",1519257600,,3355,5.171270718232044
8301092,5,B001F6GWSC,"This is a disturbing movie to watch. It was made to make people feel uncomfortable due to the subject nature. Moving past that, it makes you think for a long time after viewing.

8301098,5,B001F6GWSC,"It was written in the wake of 9/11.  It is the story of two terror suspects arrested and interrogated by the security authorities.  One is an American arrested in China and the other is an Arab arrested by the FBI.
The interrogations are almost identical.  The language used by each interrogator is interchangeable.  The only thing is that most people get mad at the Chinese for abusing an American but rationalize that the FBI is doing the right thing for the right reasons.
Strange, huh.
It was a HBO original movie showed once, then buried.  I guess the Bush Administration or some of its friends didn't like it.  That I understand.
It is a reminder that our civil liberties are precious and we can't let the authorities take them away, even if they claim it's for a good reason.",1395187200,,782,4.589928057553957

$99.99 is a completely ridiculous price for this item. It's not even a a Blu-ray! Maggie Gyllenhaal's fifteen-minute nude scene, which is the reason most people want this movie, is freely available in HD on the internet. I downloaded it months ago. I would like to see the rest of this HBO special, but not at this absurd price.
