2727929,4,B000MC3QWK,"I am very glad to see that this hilarious series is finally out on DVD here in our US region. I would rate this as easily one of the top twelve Brit coms of all time (my other favorites being Fawlty Towers, Last of the Summer Wine, The Young Ones, If Wishes Were Horses, Little Britain, Absolutely Fabulous, Are You Being Served, Keeping Up Appearances, As Time Goes By, One Foot in the Grave, and Waiting for God).

Ronnie Barker does a magnificent job as shopkeeper Arkwright, a stout, middle-aged proprietor of a small grocery in an unnamed Yorkshire town. After watching about thirty seconds of Episode 1 you will realize that (1) he has an extremely amusing stuttering habit; (2) he is notoriously tightfisted and (3) he lusts after his neighbor, the plain but amply-proportioned Nurse Gladys Emmanuel. What makes the show for me are the wonderful conversations between the--let's be honest here--very horny Arkwright and the resistant Gladys. He's constantly on the offensive, and nurse Gladys, a single woman caring for her invalid mother, puts up a good fight (she's neither naive nor a prude, and though she'd never admit it, she unconsciously welcomes the attention that this aging would-be lover showers upon her). Of course, the parsimonious Arkwright is very reluctant to open up the wallet too wide, even for the nurse. But as you will see, the promise of a kiss and a caress wins out.

This show is at least thirty years old, but it holds up well. The English, and Europeans in general, have long been much more tolerant of race than us Yanks, and also do not seem anywhere near as hung up about sex. Consequently you have in Arkwright and nurse Gladys a couple of physically unspectacular middle-aged people who DO--particularly Arkwright--think about sex and pursue it. In US shows if you are not beautiful and/or extremely young, you have no sex life.

American viewers will have to listen carefully lest they miss some of the absolutely devastating double entendres which come out of the mouth of Arkwright. You'll find yourself saying ""Did he just say what I think he said?"" over and over again. I wonder how they got some of his utterances past the censors (oh, that's right, this is a British show, not an American!).

Fans of Last of the Summer Wine will be happy to see Kathy Staff (the legendary battle axe, Norma Batty) popping in and out from time to time as a similarly-tempered neighborhood shopper).

The prolific David Jason plays Arkwright's live-in nephew, who himself is pining for romance and adventure, anything to spice up his boring existence. This was years before Jason appeared in If Wishes Were Horses, The Darling Buds of May, the excellent cop series Touch of Frost, and his latest, Diamond Geezer.",1245801600,41,2742,4.825531914893617
2727930,5,B000MC3QWK,"It's fantastic to see this all in one set as I had to buy it as each series was released to DVD and the wait between was well, not excruciating maybe, but definitely nerve wuh,whah, wruh - difficult. ;) It is one of the few BBC shows that never seems to get repeat runs, and one of my favourites since seeing the original run as a kid. Down to the show, the writing is superb, the delivery sublime and the chemistry amazing between stuffy old tightwad Arkwright and his ""young"" nephew Gehger, Geguh, G-Granville.

Speaking of which, the Amazon review misses the point slightly - Granville isn't literally supposed to be a teenager. Maybe the reviewer hasn't seen many episodes but it's definitely an intentional joke on the part of the older characters and Granville often laments being the world's oldest shopboy. Similarly Arkwright's stuttering is not a mean joke at sufferers' expense but a knowing and ironic comment on both the character of Arkwright's fiscally sharp tongue and cagey ways and an ironic wink from one of the best examples of great dialogue on television.

For me this is the defining performance/character from the brilliant Ronnie Barker. Such a shame he's gone.

I love this show. You won't regret picking it up.",1245715200,7,1237,4.7981220657277
2727931,3,B000MC3QWK,"I have decided to rate the Open All Hours Complete series DVDs with 3 stars and I wish I could had given it 5.

I have been waiting a long time for these series to appear on DVD.  I remember watching these shows as far back as the 80's.  I enjoyed all of the episodes of Open All Hours but I must say I have one issue however about an edit point which has made me refuse to watch the rest of the DVD series disks altogether and that is a cut taken out from the second series ""The New Suit"" which contained a dancing jig with Granville dancing in the rain outside of Arkwright's shop humming the tune called ""Singing in the Rain"".  Apparently the makers of this series couldn't get clearance to keep this portion in the DVD.

This edited portion was aired by videotape, unedited, on PBS back in the 80's where I live and there was none of this editing out of sections.  Why the change now?  There was a short melody with humming in it.  This isn't the same as playing the actual song which would had been in violation of copyrights.  In this case I don't see any copyrights being infringed at all.

The recording industries have gone too far in their censoring of materials.  The Gene Kelley tune from the film ""Singing in the Rain"" that I have seen from uncut versions from this series was a reenactment/interpretation of that tune and not a real representation of the above stated song.  There is a name for this type of imitation of a song and I cannot recall it now and it is protected by censorship.

I feel that this DVD series is not complete because of this one edit point and I don't know if there are any other edits since I don't have the pleasure of viewing the rest of the DVDs due to there possibly being more edits of minor little things that I see as not being a big deal because they are interpretations of an act; as in the above case of the tune Granville hums outside the shop.  What would be lost by the recording industries if they agreed to include that jig with Granville dancing with the broom and humming ""Singing in the Rain""?  Nothing at all.

All in All, I have always loved the show but this edited section of ""The New Suit"" episode has ruined it for me and it ruins the episode more and has prevented me from viewing the rest of the episodes.",1244678400,18,2272,4.248837209302326

2727934,4,B000MC3QWK,"""Open All Hours"" (1976 - 1985) is #8 on the ""Britian's Best Sitcom"" list from a poll conducted in 2004 by the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4.  Instead of drawn out, overpriced, single series releases we get the entire program of 4 series (25 episodes) at once this time at a reasonable price!  Special features are to include the pilot which aired as an episode of the 1973 series ""Seven of One"".

Written by Roy Clarke (""Last of the Summer Wine"", ""Keeping Up Appearances"") the series takes place primarily in a small grocer's shop, in Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The owner, a middle-aged, tight-fisted man, will stop at nothing to keep his profits high and his overhead low. He has a pronounced stammer and a knack of being able to sell anything. His put upon nephew is his errand boy, whose attempts at a love-life or even just a social life fall flat. He blames his uncle that he has to be up early to open the shop and stay late to close it.

Nurse Gladys Emmanuel, Arkwright's long-standing fiance, and only weakness, lives across the road. Arkwright spends an inordinate amount of time attempting to make her marry, or at least sleep with him.

The primary characters in the series are:
Ronnie Barker (Porridge) - Arkwright, the shop owner
David Jason (Only Fools and Horses) - Granville, his nephew
Lynda Baron - Nurse Gladys Emmanuel

Keep your eyes open for Kathy Staff (Last Of the Summer Wine) and Stephanie Cole (Waiting For God) as customers.

2727954,5,B000MC3QWK,"Amazed to find this iconic and dearly loved British TV Comedy  series on Amazon.com  and delighted that it is so popular.
It holds a special place in British culture.
The much missed comedy character actor Ronnie Barker was totally wonderful as Arkwright, the epitome of a shrewd small businessman.
 David Jason somehow convinced us that at 36, he was a teenage/early twenty something shop boy Granville, Lynda Baron balanced things perfectly as Arkwright's love interest, District Nurse Gladys Emmanuel.

It's of its time, Arkwright's frequent comments on Nurse Gladys' buxom figure wouldn't be included in a sitcom today, but it still holds up wonderfully well.

The psychopathic cash till is quite possibly the greatest comedy prop ever, the master-pupil relationship between Arkwright and Granville probably repeated in some way in every culture across the globe.

There is a new series on British TV  now, called Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason as a much older Granville, who has morphed slightly into Arkwright, but is still as incident prone as ever. Nurse Gladys is still around, and so is Mrs Featherstone (Stephanie Cole). The evil cash till is as well.
 It's a joy. So is the original.",1455494400,,1207,5.091370558375634

2727956,4,B000MC3QWK,"And enjoyable series, quirkier and heavier on the overtly British in-jokes than some other British sit-coms.

2727966,2,B000MC3QWK,I bought this without ever seeing any of it. What a disappointment .  The reason I took a chance was because the writer Roy Clarke has written two of my favorite British comedies Keeping up Appearances and Last of Summer Wine. Also the reviews on this site were very good. Before you buy this or any other show you haven't seen check and see if it's on youtube. One thing that really gets me is that you have David Jason who was 36 {who could pass for 46} when the show started playing a 25 year old and then he acts like an 18 year old. I bought the complete series and I'm not sure I'll watch it all.,1437782400,,602,4.0588235294117645
2727967,4,B000MC3QWK,"A quaint comedy, an ode to bygone years, that holds up well do entirely to Ronnie Barker's performance as the irascible Albert Arkwright.  He's a tightfisted skinflint with a voracious till given to snapping at fingers.  His overriding passions are money, money, and Nurse Gladys Emmanuel (Lynda Baron).  He's not above selling expired foodstuffs for a profit.  The series follows him through four years in the trade as he doggedly pursues Nurse Gladys Emmanuel; forever engaged, never to marry.

Genuinely funny most of the time, the only drawback for me was the casting of David Jason as the young lad Granville (Jason was well over 40 for most of the series and he looked every bit of it).  The vain attempt to define him as being much younger goes against the humor he was expected to (over) play most of the time.  Towards the end of the series, Granville came across as a desperate jerk pursuing much younger women, giving it a high `creep' factor that was impossible to overlook.

The best addition to the cast in the last two seasons was Stephanie Cole as Delphine Featherstone.

Enjoyed watching it once, can't see wanting to watch it again though.",1435190400,,1157,4.773869346733668

2727993,5,B000MC3QWK,"As a great fan of Roy Clarke, I was very interested to sample his sitcom about a tight-fisted, stuttering shopkeeper Arkwright and his overworked assistant Granville.  Clarke has always had a great knack for seeing the bizarre sides of very ordinary people and making us laugh at them.  With Arkwright it's his stammer, a very real handicap for many people, but in the great Ronnie Barker's hands a tool of comedic genius that never feels like a slight to those who suffer with the handicap.  Granville is a romantic dreamer, constantly pining for life beyond their drab little shop and the strange assortment of customers they serve.
Like Clarke's other great show, ""Last of the Summer Wine"", the plot is often immaterial to the thrust of the show.  If there is any plot at all,  it usually comes about in the last few minutes of the show.  The real comedy comes from the chemistry between Ronnie Barker and David Jason, their verbal spars with each other and with the customers of the shop.  What is it about the north of England that produces such colorful characters?  The women are either fierce and sensible (Mrs. Blewit, Nurse Gladys Emanuel, and Mrs. Featherstone the ""black widow"") or dumb (Mavis, among a few others), where the men are mostly dumb and decent.  It touches on something in the human condition that is both quirky and funny.  There are a handful of clever sight-gags for a big laugh or two sprinkled throughout the show but this is mostly a verbal comedy program.  Not to mention Arkwright's constant pining for the buxom but highly sensible Nurse Gladys Emanuel, maybe the only person in the world who can make the stingy shopkeeper reach for his money belt (tied to his chest!)

Fortunate to have been around and growing up in the time this was set and can relate so much to the goings on of Arkwright, Granville and even some of the customers who used the store.

Obviously being biased from the above comments, but if you're not from the UK, and want to know the gentler side of how the UK got through the 70`s then I reckon you cant go wrong in adding this to your collection, and when I bought it, it was at a bargain price too!

Definitely recommended.",1308614400,8,654,4.09375
2728025,5,B000MC3QWK,"I used to watch this on my local PBS channel when it was on. When I saw the chance to get all 4 seasons (26)episodes for a great price I jumped on it. It comes in one cd case that holds all 4 cd's, compact-clean packaging.

 This in my opinion is another classic British comedy. Although some may think It old fashioned I find it to be a lasting and endearing series. Arkwright as a small grocer, is always trying to make money (certainly not spend it lol), all the while persuing Nurse Gladys Emmmanuel, but his character is very likeable, and then there is Granville his long suffering Nephew who always longs for excitement in his life, as he works for Arkwright as an errand boy. As you watch,these characters become like old friends.

There is a text-biography of the series creator Roy Clarke, and a bonus episode (1973 series pilot). I am so glad they are offering this wonderful series on DVD. I am laughing my way through each and every disk.

2728031,5,B000MC3QWK,"Ronnie Barker's comic consistency is seen nowhere better than in this charming, gentle series. Its time frame and the nature of the business setting evoke a Britain whose citizens are devising personal identities not dependent on its rapidly disappearing empire status. One could criticize the show for being dated (and I notice that some have), but the timing of the leads is as reliable as the nights that fall and the suns that rise over shopkeeper Arkwright's premises. Expecting more is about as futile as Arkwright's hopes for being invited into Nurse Gladys Emanuel's fabled budoir. Lynda Baron is terrific as Nurse Gladys, as is David Jason as Arkwright's nephew Granville.",1280793600,4,681,5.1441441441441444
2728032,5,B000MC3QWK,"'Open all hours' remains a staple of British comedy, rerun over and over. Although dated in some respects it remains as funny as ever, and much of that is due to Barkers amazing acting. Primarily a character actor Barker infuses laughter and charm and wit into an unlikely lovable character as he did with Fletcher in 'Porridge'

The chemistry between the main actors is beautiful to watch as Awkright fails to charm his way into Nurse Glady's NHS regulation uniform and keep hormone stricken Granville in line.

It is easy to get into as much of the information is repeated in gags I.E Awkrights dislike of spending money, Granville's attempts to chat up girls and dreaming of a life of adventure and excitement. It is suitable for a marathon viewing or just one or two episodes when the mood strikes you. An excellent series from a much loved and missed national treasure.",1275782400,3,874,4.743421052631579
2728033,5,B000MC3QWK,"Being from the British side of the pond, I was able to view the series in its entirety without the boundaries of censorship or otherwise.  I recently purchased this box set as a gift for a friend in the USA.  Sadly, he will be unable to see the amazing ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence which should not be missed.  Perhaps the box set could be renamed for the American audience as ""Open All Hours:  The Incomplete Series.""  However, there are still many wonderfully funny moments and I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys our dry British humour.",1264636800,9,563,4.59
2728034,3,B000MC3QWK,"As many others have stated this is another sitcom from the Brits who gave us ""Yes Prime Minister"", ""Are You Being Served"" etc.  Ronnie Barker carries the show with his dry humor and his character as the miserly but lovable shopkeeper.  At times the antics with his lover the nurse gets a tad old but those moments are few and far between.  There are four DVDs in this set and for the cost this is a fair value.

A word of caution.  Much of the humor is based on the shopkeeper's (Barker) speech impediment.  Watching this over and over does make one ask the question - is it fair game to use someone's impediment as the focus of humor?  Will it be funny if one uses say Parkinson disease and its tremors as a source of humor?  How about a blind person?  How about someone having a seizure? My point is this may offend some folks and it is best to be warned before coughing up a significant amount for this product.  I have always found that using a person's ""handicap"" as a source of humor just does not feel right.  Why? Because it seems like a desperate attempt to get a laugh when the material is bereft of substance.

I for one find this series somewhat funny but not in the same class of say, ""Are You Being Served"" and definitely not even half as good as ""Yes Prime Minister"" and miles below ""Last of the Summer Wine"".",1264464000,4,1324,4.2730923694779115
2728035,5,B000MC3QWK,"I would call this dvd not open all hours because ths dvd is quite funny.
The story is about a shopkeeper who has a store, he is a stutterer and who is a miser. The store however, is not open late at night.
The shopkeeper has a fancy for the nurse across the street.
The nurse across the street is rather large in girth.

I like British humor because it is a dry wit.

Others have written about the characters so I won't, but if you're an American like me who loves old Britcoms like ""On The Buses,"" you will enjoy this set.",1257292800,,478,4.443181818181818

2728039,5,B000MC3QWK,"Open All Hours is a nice slice of late 70s-early 80s british television that focuses on a stuttering, miserly shopkeeper (Ronnie Barker), his nephew (David Jason), and the shopkeeper's love interest who lives across the street. Very mild bawdy humor and enjoyably consistent characters make for a nice half-hour of amusement, but it's the subtle environment of a quieter, slower paced and simpler time that envelopes the show with a nice departure from the rushing, brash and in-your-face television that saturates our sets currently.
 The DVD quality was clear and clean, beyond my expectations for a show this old, and all the better for preserving this slice-of-shop-life britcom. There are only one or two extras included on the disk, one being a pilot episode introduced a couple of years before the actuall series began, but having the entire series neatly availiable on 2 disks in good color and clarity is pleasing enough.
I was already familiar with the series from a PBS run over a decade ago, so it's very nice to have Open All Hours released for home viewing, and in such good condition.",1252713600,3,1099,4.940540540540541

2728043,5,B000MC3QWK,"Ronnie Barker is a classic as is Jason his side kick. I wish they would put ""The Two Ronnies"" on DVD for the USA market. My whole family loved this series when it was on PBS many years ago. However, the management at PBS in the NYC area has very strange programing tastes and won't show this or some of the other superior Britoms, like ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"". Ronnie as Arkwright is the stereotypical English shop keeper. One of my favorites is when someone comes in and asks ""Can you give me directions?"". Ronnie's character, Arkwright looks at him, appalled and replies, ""Give you directions?! GIVE YOU DIRECTIONS?! I could SELL you directions, or of course if you were to make a small token purchase, of course the directions would be free..."" Ronnie's portrayal of the stuttering shop keeper is not to be missed. There is clever dialog and double entendre throughout. You will also spot a few other veteran Brit com actors such as the character, ""The widow Twanky"" (who later plaied the acerbic Diana Trent in the also brilliant ""Waiting for God"", and I believe the character is ""Mrs. Bluett"", who is paid by the gem of an actress who also plaid ""Nora Batty"" in ""Last of the Summer Wine"".

2728044,5,B000MC3QWK,"Yes, FINALLY!! Here is one of Britain's funniest sitcoms that makes it's complete and welcome debut to America. After being shown in the US on various tv stations over the years, the show seemed to vanish. With 1 vhs USA release with a few sampled episodes released years ago, we are at last graced with the release of the complete series in one set. NOW.
The humor is not forced with this show. It could happen to anyone, and probably has! It is a show that doesn't rely on slapstick or crude humor. The show has a certain 'grace', that with each episode the viewer almost believes he/she is watching 2 shop keepers making do with each day.
The acting is, and in my opinion, IS superb.
I won't compare this show to the many others from Britain that the USA had the chance to watch over the years, as this show is in a place of it's own. The only show I would compare it to, is 'Allo, Allo', another classic.

I must admit I was very disappointed as I didn't find a lot of the jokes funny, and some of the references to women were very crude and out of date.  Although the setting is very simple and easy to get into, I think time has just moved on. People are likely to find a lot of the jokes offensive and sexist, rather than funny in this day and age. Even besides that, I didn't find myself laughing too much despite this being a comedy.
