1418127,4,B00005ASPE,"Based on Charles Busch's long-running stage play, this film focuses on Chicklet, a wannabe surfer girl with a split personality who becomes one of the many suspects when a series of murders hit the beach.
An all-star cast, a fun plot, and a terrific performance by Lauren Ambrose save this film from becoming a total waste. I didn't really know what to expect from this film, but I was looking forward to it. I can't say that I;m extremely disappointed, but I was expecting better. It's a fun film, I'll give it that, with terrific and funny characters. All the characters are unique and outrageous, and the reason behind the killings is funny in itself, but the film drags on too much in the beginning and doesn't go anywhere until near the end, when it just becomes confusing with all the intentionally lame twists...its those twists that made the film better...Lauren Ambrose gives an incredible performance, she deserves so much better as an actress and this film proves it. Hopefully now with Six Feet Under, she can show off her acting talent to the world...this film however is strictly comedy, with lots of sex references, but hardly any skin, and no gore whatsover, so for all you gore hounds, steer clear, this is the wrong film for you. I did enjoy it though and will watch it again, it seems like the kind of film that grows on you after repeated viewings...If you're one of the people dying to see this film, check it out, if you had your doubts, stay away...",993513600,2,1472,4.622137404580153

The big PROBLEM is the director or some lost soul told her to NOT use her lovely aussie accent for the entire movie....translation = major bummer, they have her talking in some bizarre high pitch everytime she is on camera?? anyhow she looks awesome even in a flowery beach dress, but NO bikini can u believe that geezus, she is also not shown on the rental box whatsoever, good grief people ! ever hear of babe marketing 101??? as for the other ''actors'' (term used ever so lightly) who cares? HAHAHA , they're all unknowns HA. .......BEST scene by far is the beach dance where KIMMY D really gets n2 the sand and gives some killer moves and yuMMy smiles too !! worth a rent by all means leave her accent alone !!

1418129,2,B00005ASPE,"One of the reasons Charles Busch's parodies work so well on stage is the number of drag peformances that that make them high camp. In the stage play of this work for example he played the lead role of Chicklet and the beautiful sex kitten Mary Ann was also played by a man. In the film they are played by ""real"" girls and, as a result, much of the fun is lost. Busch does appear in drag in the new role of the police detective. But being the only drag performer makes him stand out glaringly. This coupled with his exagerated stage performance rather than a film performance only makes it worse. However, if the other actors had chosen to work in the same Susan Hayward look-ma-I'm-acting style of Busch the film might have made it. So, instead of being campy as the original, and as it should have been. The film doesn't achieve its potential. It's rather a mediocre version of the tedious (but often funny--still often unfunny) parodies the Abrahams brothers crank out. Let's hope that when Busch & Co. make another film they aren't afraid to go all out. (Mrs. Brown and her church cronies aren't going to come see it anyway.) Then it won't be so disappointing!",990316800,7,1163,4.516587677725118
1418130,5,B00005ASPE,"First of all, anyone who comes up with the movie title ""Sex Kittens Go Bossa Nova"" deserves some sort of award or national holiday in their honor for that alone. I was sold on this movie way before the incredibly cool opening credits rolled. Actually, I was sold when we saw the trailer for it in the theater, and almost instantly said, ""we're there"".
  There's about a dozen different elements to this fun flick that would have made me see it if only one of them had been present. First, I've seen almost every 60's Beach Party movie (though I'm sure Charles Busch has most people beat on the number of times they were watched) and this is not only a hilarious parody, but the 60's detail down to the costumes, sets, make-up, and hair is so dead-on I wouldn't have been surprised to see Donna Loren or Deborah Walley show up. Check out the cover and poster art if you want to see how perfect it is. The soundtrack is really, really great, some of the best surf music that wasn't actually recorded in the 1960's I've ever heard. The plot is actually really clever, with one of the best twist-upon-twist endings I've ever seen. The opening credits and closing credits are great, and I'm sure any guys who didn't really want to see the movie but were dragged by their girlfriends will dig the hot Ann-Margret crossed with a Bada-Bing! girl go-go dancer.
  I first heard about this movie when I read about it in Fangoria, of all places. I was interested by what I read but thought, ""they better not screw this up"". Once I saw about 30 seconds of the trailer- which by the way is featured on both the VHS and DVD versions, along with a music video- I realized they knew exactly what they were doing. The movie actually has more of an actual plot than many of the 60's beach movies did (not that either really needed one). The plot centers on a series of Blood-Feast type murders in Malibu. In their search for the killer, the female police detective (Charles Busch, who is probably the funniest of anyone in the movie) focuses on Florence (Lauren Ambrose, almost as funny), who suffers from a very entertaining form of multiple personality disorder but doesn't know it yet. There's a huge number of great supporting characters, such as her love interests Starcat and surf God Kanaka. Bettina Barnes, a B-movie actress on the lam from Hollywood who is renting a haunted house on the beach, shows up to add extra glamour. Also especially funny-especially if you thought parts of those old beach movies got kind of homoerotic-are young beach studs Yo-Yo and Provoloney (next to John Waters, this movie has to have come up with the greatest names for characters of all time) who are suspiciously more interested in wrestling each other than checking out the chicks in bikinis.
  If this weren't enough, Busch also makes almost every single line include some sort of campy and hilarious 60's lingo. If you've read or seen the play the movie was based on, you know exactly what I mean. The young cast, which could have ruined the movie if they winked at the camera even once, are talented enough to take lines like, ""Is this a beach shack or the Malibu branch of the CIA?"" and ""They look like beatniks...should I unpack my bongos?"" and make them sound fresh and funny. Considering most of them probably weren't born until a decade or so after these type of movies came out (yikes), this is pretty impressive. Ambrose is perfect as Florence ""Chicklet"" Forrest/Ann Bowman, and if Busch (who played the part onstage) had to tutor her at all on how to play it, she picked it up pretty well. Busch has less scenes, but almost steals the movie- he's probably the funniest (and best) drag performer I've seen in a movie since Divine left us to go make heaven flashy. His facial expressions alone made me laugh so hard when I saw it in the theater that I was worried the usher might come over. Fortunately everyone else was laughing just as hard. There's plenty of shockingly raunchy jokes, but somehow the whole movie still seems as innocent and good-natured as if it were rated G. Ok, maybe not G, but you get the idea.  Everyone involved in the making of the film obviously loved what they were doing -not only this movie, but also the subject matter that inspired it.
A completely fun, clever but brainless, campy movie with an awesome cast, screenplay, wardrobe and soundtrack, perfect from the font used in the opening credits down to the last tiki torches. It's pretty hard for me to think of anyone who this movie wouldn't at least bring a smile to. You don't even need to have seen a Beach Party movie to have a good time-it's not all in-jokey (though those who grew up on those movies will probably notice and appreciate some smaller details more). Even if you have no idea who Annette and Frankie are, as long as have a sense of humor, you should still enjoy it. If you liked Hairspray...well, now that I think of it, most fans of Hairspray probably have already seen the movie. If you liked that movie, if you want to forget about your problems for 90 minutes and have a good time, if you're into surf or just surf music, or 60's movies, or if your favorite cocktail comes in a coconut shell or tiki mug, drop everything and rent this movie now if you haven't seen it yet. You'll have a blast. Dig it?",989971200,46,5295,4.5266457680250785
1418131,3,B00005ASPE,"When ""Psycho Beach Party"" debuted off Broadway in 1987, half the fun was watching sometime drag actor Charles Busch play the part of a psycho surfer girl as if he was Joan Crawford, Annette Funicello and Sandra Dee all rolled into one. That plus the actor/playwright's keen and perverse observations of beatniks, alternate sexual lifestyles and Hollwood B-movies kept you howling madly for nearly two hours. On film, most of the original story remains intact. It's fun but the off-Broadway show was better. Florence/Chicklet, the mad surfer beach girl, still suffers from multiple split personalities. Bettina, the queen of the B-horror movies, longs for something greater. And surfer hunks Yo-Yo and Provoloney finally admit their undying love for one another. The biggest difference between the play and the movie is that Busch no longer plays Florence/Chicklett. The part is played by Lauren Ambrose, a dead ringer for ""Gidget."" Busch does show up as Captain Mona Stark, a police investigator who thinks somethings afoot on the Malibu beaches, which it is. It's a pretty campy turn, but it's fun nonetheless. Director Robert Lee King superbly captures the look, feel and sound of the 1960's while borrowing heavily from all those dopey ""Beach Party"" movies, ""Gidget,"" ""Marnie,"" ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""Scream."" Add to the mix: funky surf music, picture perfect '60s costuming, settings, lingo, cars and actors riding the surf in typical low budget fashion backed by outdoor footage of some pretty incredible waves.",989107200,25,1515,5.264462809917355
1418132,4,B00005ASPE,"A wildly fun and campy satire of the old beach movies popularized by Frankie Avalon, and of the early teen slasher movies. It's not so much about the murder mystery, but rather about the main character who keeps switching personalities. For that alone this movie was worth it! And then there's the homoeroticism, the camp value, and the zippy lines, which all make this movie just great fun.",988243200,,391,4.764705882352941
1418133,4,B00005ASPE,"Lauren Ambrose plays the Psychotic Chicklett in this Back To The Beach homage that seems to want to be a funky Slasher flick meets Annette Funicello in a head-on Collision. There's one neat head decapitation scene, but it's a mostly blood-free affair that achieves what it sets out to achieve. The humor is laid back. There's no fear of busting a gut in here, but it's fun like a Hawaiian pool party being thrown by the parents of the girl you've had a crush on since the 4th grade. A little painful in parts, but that kiss behind the swingset while the parents swap keys more than makes up for it.
The performances are key, especially Tom (Darma & Greg) Gibson's role as Kanaka, The Big Woo of Surf Hobos who has a mean crush on young Chicklet's Serial Killer alter-ego Florence Forrest. Nick Brendon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) also does a nice turn as one of the Boys Chicklet has hooked up with for some big wave lessons. It's Kitsch, but it's cool. And if you want to impress your friends when they come over for a movie, show them this gem. They won't be disappointed. It plays better on TV then at the Theater.
Added Bonus: The Los Straight Jackets turn in a nice live performance during the Beach Party Finale. If you haven't seen these guys in action, don't miss this chance.",985392000,10,1283,4.463829787234043

1418138,5,B00005ASPE,"This is one of the greatest spoofs in movie history. There are so many things about this movie to love, I really don't know where to begin. Having lived through the Annette and Frankie and Gidget and Moondoggy era, I can say that this feel's like a work of genius, Calling it ""campy"" would not do it justice. It's so much bigger. It's Gigdet and Alfred Hitchcock combined in the worst possible way. By worst, I mean best.

Let me narrow things down and talk about Lauren Ambrose for a moment. We'll get to the brilliance of Charles Busch in a moment. Ambrose's Florence, aka ""Chicklet"" (Gidgetesque) and her other personalities (she has multiple) are each more clever than the last. Her ""Ann Bowman"" is the best, in my opinion. I first saw this when Six Feet Under was airing and Ambrose was playing the youngest daughter of a funeral services empire and was blown away by her in a way I wasn't in Six Feet Under. I'm not too sure where she's been lately but she has gifts in the comedy genre that she should seriously pursue.

Moving on to Charles Busch  oh my goodness  one badass detective woman. The costumes, wig, makeup, the swagger, the one liners  I want to repeat every line but I don't want to ruin it for people who have not seen this.

There are MANY characters in this and many story lines, which, in itself, could have watered down the main plot  which is the solving of a string of serial murders in the Malibu surfing community targeting ""challenged"" people (I won't say how ""challenged""). The murders are reminiscent of those retro blood films from the 1960s (when bloodfests were still campy  before the realistic versions took over and really scared the bejesus out of me). Captain Monica Stark (Charles Busch) is investigating the murders and Lauren Ambrose is shifting from one personality to the next amidst the murders. Secondary stories (that all tie together in the end) include an ex B-movie actress renting a haunted house, a group of surfer dudes displaying non-traditional surfer dude behavior (Yo-Yo and Provoloney, specifically) and a mysterious exchange student named Lars. By the way, look close and you'll see Amy Adams as Marvel Ann. The character names are outstanding by the way.

Trust me when I say, you'll be laughing hysterically from start to finish and the end is a surprise. Can't recommend enough.

And the soundtrack is also quite outstanding.

1418161,3,B00005ASPE,"A few inspired moments set adrift on a sea of confusion.  Is it a parody or homage?  It isn't consistent enough to maintain the laughs that at times feel forced.  The timing is slow, as though they were expecting an audience to laugh so they all politely pause to let it sink in, careful not to trample on someone else's lines, only the laughter never comes, leaving them endlessly waiting.  It's neither hip nor insightful.  Sometimes it's just desperate, an eager willingness to say or do anything to gain a laugh.  The characters that work the best to preserve the integrity of the time period they're lampooning are Charles Busch (as Capt. Monica Stark), Lauren Ambrose (as Chicklet), and Thomas Gibson (as Kanaka).  The rest barely register in any meaningful way.

1418185,5,B00005ASPE,"Whether or not you end up liking this movie will partially depend on your threshold for campy humor. It seems like the people who rag on this movie have all betrayed the fact--somewhere in their review-- that Camp silliness annoys them to start with.  It will certainly help if you come into it with a love of all things Sixties and kitschy (Frankie and Annette movies, for starters).  If you like Rocky Horror and John Waters movies, then Chicklet and her shenanigans will doubtlessly tickle your funny bone.

Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under) plays Chicklet--an obvious nod to the old Gidget movies with Sandra Dee. All she wants to do is learn how to surf and hang out with her mousy friend Berdine. The only problem is, seeing certain geometric shapes and patterns triggers Chicklet's latent ""split personality"" (including a dominatrix named Ann Bowman and a hilarious Safeway Checkout girl named--of all things--Tylene Carmichael Carmelle). As if that weren't enough, her friends keep dropping dead. Is Chicklet the murderer?

It would have been easy enough to play this as broad comedy for easy laughs, but the directors wisely restrain the impulse to go overboard, keeping the actors on a (relatively) tight leash. The camerawork achieves genre authenticity--indeed, many scenes could be mistaken for an actual 1960's surf movie. Lauren Ambrose in the lead does a great job of ""playing it straight"", which only makes everything even funnier. In fact, the entire cast does a fine job of convincing you they think they're in a drama. Charles Bush as Captain Monica Stark does his best Eve Arden. And the ""Bettina Barnes"" character of a reclusive B-movie starlet is delightfully dippy and even manages some pathos in between the laughs.

Highly enjoyable, absurd and sublime. I also give this film 5 stars for re-watchability. (Not only does it lend itself to repeat viewings, but it's a fun movie to show your friends or play at parties.",1373414400,,1940,4.9753086419753085

1418193,4,B00005ASPE,"Award-winning author, playwright, and drag maven Charles Busch freely admits that his constant inspiration has been the campy, big-shouldered and scenery chewing glam gals of classic cinema - Hayward, Davis, Crawford.  And out of this fevered imagination, he has given us campy, laugh-out-loud classics like ""Theodora:  She-Bitch of Byzantium"" and ""Die, Mommie! Die!""  In ""Psycho Beach Party,"" he merges two of the most put upon and overacted cinematic genres - the horror film and the ""beach blanket"" movie - and turns them into his special, patented blend of comedy.  Although he originated the role of Florence, aka ""Chicklet,"" on stage, in this film, that part - the ""surfer girl with a split personality"" - is played to a ""T"" by Lauren Ambrose of ""Six Feet Under,"" who ranges from ""gee whiz"" to ""Bon Qui Qui"" to foul mouthed dominatrix, Ann Bowman, in a dizzy testament to young comedic virtuosity.  The supporting cast, led by Busch, who has turned in his surfboard and now appears as Monica Stark, a hard-nosed police detective lifted straight out of the hilarious best of 1970's television, is excellent.  And Busch's writing has never been better - the B movie ""shock"" lines and over-the-top tabloid situations delivered in a uniquely American deadpan that gently mocks the genres he loves while, at the same time, gives them a kind of new life in a time that may be on the verge of forgetting them completely.

In reading the critiques, I was taken aback by something.  This is a COMEDY.  It is not a slasher flick, it is not a beach flick, but a loving parody, Charles Busch's unique specialty.

So, if you dislike parody, especially parody where the humor is in snappy ""left-hook,"" ""right hook"" dialogue, this is not your film.  But for Busch fans, parody lovers, afficianadoes of snappy one liners, and cheerleaders for ""high camp,"" you cannot miss with the delightfully subversive ""Psycho Beach Party.""

1418198,3,B00005ASPE,"""Psycho Beach Party"" is a parody of teen slasher horror films, taking place in the 1960's. It's a combination of beach movie, horror film, and camp. It's really not a very good movie for the general public, but as a cheesy camp flick it has its appeal, and it's worth at least a rent, at least for people who like this kind of John Waters-esque camp. My main complaint is that it seems to try a bit too hard. But it's a great movie if you're in a certain kind of relaxed mood. Anyway, we have a copy of it in our collection, and re-watched it yesterday.

Florence ""Chicklet"" Forrest (Lauren Ambrose, of ""Six Feet Under"") is the highlight of the whole movie, and makes the film worthwhile just on her merits alone. Her character has multiple personalites, the main two being the nice, peppy Florence, but the hilarious one is her alter-ego ""Anne Bowen"", a dominiatrix minx. Ambrose switches back and forth seamlessly and hilariously between these two personalities (and a minor third one).

The story: Florence and her best friend Berdine (Danni Wheeler) get involved in a series of murders after Florence starts hanging out with the all-male surfers' club, wanting to be part of the group. Captain Monica Stark (played by writer, actor and novelist Charles Busch, who for some reason saw fit to be cast in this female part - he is not really funny, and the character is treated as if she were really female, instead of a obvious man in drag) is the officer in charge of the case. Add to the mix a sequestered B-horror film actress, Bettina Barnes (Kimberley Davies), Florence's picture-perfect mother, Ruth (Beth Broderick), psychology major dropout Starcat (Nicholas Brendon, of the TV series ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer""), the catty Marvel Ann (Amy Adams, of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""), Swedish exchange student, Lars (Matt Kessler), Kathleen Robertson as the bitchy, wheelchair-bound Rhonda, whom you really just want to literally push out of her chair, and the supposedly omnipotent Kanaka (Thomas Gibson), a great soundtrack, and you've got a completely silly, fun film for lovers of the cheesy camp genre.",1125360000,6,2104,4.874301675977653

The plot was not the best in the world thats not to say it wasn't good; it's just that there's something about this film that makes you feel young again, and Lauren Ambrose performance was terrific!.

1418203,4,B00005ASPE,"Surf's up all you hep cats and hep kitties! Psycho Beach Party is a crazy movie that parodies and celebrates those kitschy beach party movies of the'60s and sci-fi films of the'50s.
Like John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China before it, Psycho Beach Party is a clever satire of genre films because it faithfully presents all the important characteristics of the beach party movie, the psychological thriller and the slasher film and then turns them on their head.
One of the movie's strengths is the wonderful casting against type. Nicholas Brendon, known for playing the geeky Xander on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is cast as a confident surfer with issues. Thomas Gibson, whose claim to fame was playing a straight-laced office worker on the popular T.V. series, Dharma and Greg, is the Great Kanaka, the suave king of the local surfers.
The extras are slim at best, however, the engaging audio commentary by director Robert Lee King and screenwriter Charles Busch is excellent. They talk about the constraints they faced with a tight shooting schedule and a low budget.
The DVD also features a music video for the song Los Straitjackets performs during the climatic luau in the movie. The video features footage of the band with the go-go dancer from the opening and closing credits cut together with clips from the movie. Finally, there is the theatrical trailer for the movie.
Psycho Beach Party is a fun movie that features an diverse cast, a killer soundtrack of contemporary surf music (from the likes of Man or Astro-Man and The Hillbilly Soul Surfers) and some truly memorable dialogue. This is a movie that slipped through the cracks of theatrical distribution only to find new life on Cable T.V. and video.",1088467200,14,1722,4.920962199312715

1418205,3,B00005ASPE,"This mixture of sex, camp, and beach parties pays semi-homage to the cheesy monster genre of the '50s and '60s, but whatever affection writer Charles Busch has for the genre gets lost in cheap parody.

The story is simple enough. Tomboy Chicklet (Lauren Ambrose) can't seem to please her overprotective mother (Beth Broderick), her possessive best friend Berdine (Danni Wheeler), the ""popular"" girls, led by Marvel-Ann (Amy Adams), or the hunky surfers, including guru Kanaka (Thomas Gibson), and the sexually confused Yo Yo and Provoloney (Nick Cornish and Andrew Levitas, respectively). An emotionally strained Chicklet develops alter egos, new people come to town, including B-movie starlet Bettina Barnes (Kimberley Davies) and foreign exchange student Lars (Matt Keeslar)--and of course, to add to the mess, a serial killer is on the loose.

Busch's hit stage play probably should have stayed on the stage. For the most part, what should have been camp comes across as tired and simply unfunny. And more often than not, while the modern-day humor and sexual innuendo thrown into a film of this genre is funny, it seems too out of place and sometimes a bit stale. However, some good performances are delivered, notably by Daives and also Busch himself, who plays a woman police officer heading the investigation of the serial killings. He played Chicklet on the stage, and the gender-bending here was crucial. Though Ambrose (now of ""Six Feet Under"" fame) delivers a fine performance, the comedy is skewed and the campy homage to the disenfranchised is lost with a female in the leading role.

The utter craziness of the goings-on will keep one laughing throughout, but the film lacks something that will keep its audiences from really wanting to see it a second time.",1086566400,2,1772,5.103448275862069
1418206,5,B00005ASPE,"All these reviews do this movie justice, if I went on to explain each and every reason that I enjoy this film so much, I would just be repeating what has already said. NO QUESTION YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD!!!!",1075852800,,205,4.15
1418207,4,B00005ASPE,"I unfortunately missed this movie when it first came out as mainstream reviewers were not that impressed. Even the less mainstream ""The Village Voice"" did not think much of it. I am glad that I finally caught it on DVD as they were dead wrong. While some disliked the tongue in cheek humor and thought it lacked cleverness, I had a really good time watching this romp which is a campy fusion of teenaged surfer flicks and slasher sagas. There are many other homages, but it's like the TV show ""The Simpsons"", as we are not going to get all that is thrown our way, but there is more than enough the recommend this whacked out parody.
Impossibly perky Florence (played brilliantly by a pre ""Six Feet Under"" Lauren Ambrose) doesn't quite fit in high school in her seaside Southern California town. Of course who feel like they do, but when she meets and gets the implicit approval of Kanaka (played perfectly by Thomas Gibson) she starts moving up the food chain of a band of ""ultra-hip"" surfer dudes. These guys area a riot and embody the homoerotic tension that exists in all-male domains and well are serving as a great parody of Danny's friends from the movie ""Grease"". Of course that is also a parody in many respects. The surf sequences pay their respect to those cheesy Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello movies.
I won't reveal too much as I hate when reviewers give too much away, but Florence becomes ""Chicklet,"" (or shall we say Gidget) as she tries her gosh-darnedest to be the sole girl riding the waves with the male group. While adopting her surfer alter ego, Florence soon discovers that other less pleasant personalities emerge when confronted with the sight of polka dots. One called Anne Bowman is a tough, ""experienced"" older lady, while the other, Tylene, is a stereotypical sassy black woman. Ambrose is a crack up in all of these scenes and those who love the Anne Bowman persona are a hoot. Blacking out whenever these other personalities take over, Florence becomes increasingly worried that she is responsible for a series of grizzly murders of people that have one thing in common..... Of course, she is far from the only suspicious character in her ocean side.
This movie, which was adapted from Charles Busch's hit play, has Mr. Busch playing a hilarious yet not over the top Eve Arden-like police investigator is trying to figure out who's killing who. The physical resemblance to Eve Arden is almost scary as is a scene which reveals a little about her past with one of the main characters. Just keep in mind that Mr. Busch is a man when you see the extended encounter.
Besides the usual cast of characters and great ear for 1960's teen-talk, Mr. Busch throws in original touches such as an excessively polite, bespectacled exchange student from Sweden, a psychology major from Northwestern who dispenses nuggets of Freudian psychology, and a physically challenged character with a mouth on her that made me laugh every single time that she was onscreen. The costumes are a hoot (just the swimsuits are worth the price of admission), the dcor is flawless and while this is without a doubt a spoof of several movie genres, it does it in a loving and respectful fashion.
I am not suggesting in any way that this movie is for everyone or is Oscar-worthy, but my barometer for any movie is did I enjoy or was I touched by what I saw. I certainly enjoyed the movie and it's paced so well that it ends just a little before you'd like it to, but as they say, leave 'em wanting more.",1073692800,5,3504,4.653225806451613

 Psycho beach party is a funny and witty movie. That makes fun of the beach movies of the 60's ( It's about time).It's a Psycho/Manic-mixture of 50's Suspense and ""DUH"" 60's beach movies,and 70's Halloween/friday the 13thish slasher flixs
 My favorite actress Lauren Ambrose ( HBO series Six feet Under) is Florence (Chicklet) Forrest who really wants to be a surfer chick and be part of the Malibu beach crowd and also win the heart of StarCat, Plus also fight some inner demons and problems which is due to the fact her personality is spilt like a sliced pizza. Her personalities are wacky as she is, but as diffrent as night and day, there is Anne Bowman a sexy and forward & dominate personality that see's herself as the dominatrax empress of the planet earth. So don't mess with Anne Bowman and don't try to escape her power. Than there is Tylene Carmicheal Carmel who is a tough chick that works the check out at the safeway who has a blade who will cut you , so don't mess with this personality of chicklet's. Lauren Ambrose is a great actress who makes each one of her diffrent personalities sound and act so diffrent from each other that makes you wonder how this actress can do it. She makes being a perky and Zany surfer chick with multi-personality issues seem easy and fun.
 Nicholas Brendon who's claim to fame is Buffy the vampire slayer's Xander. In Buffy he plays the Not popular-dense comedy one liner, but in psycho beach party he plays StarCat...who is the great Kanaka's handsome right hand man and the coolest and hottest surfer in Malibu, StarCat is smart and has a background in Psycho Analytic theory , the perfect golden boy of the Malibu beach crowd. But he is still a goof ball with deep rooted complex anxiety and feelings, who doesn't see the cool in chicklet. Plus doesn't know if he can trust Chicklet due to the fact she may be the slasher of malibu beach.
 Then there is Thomas Gibson who is the Greg in Dharma & Greg..here he plays the king of the beach Kanaka, the smooth surfer who has a shack on the beach who more than anything lives for mother wave. But with a unknown fetish of being dominated until chicket uncovers the slave boy side of him. Who also had a thing with Captain Monica Stark, who just wants to live for the moment and then surf the waves.
All the actors and actresses are funny and superb.

1418219,2,B00005ASPE,"I wanted to love this movie much more, as much as I have loved Charles Busch on stage, but, except for a few sequences (the dance-off at the beach being one of them), I found that the necessary literalization of film sat heavily on the material. It could also be that the film was not that well-directed, or that the budget simply didn't allow for a greater variety of shots or tighter editing. There's also the problem that, in these days of sitcoms like WILL & GRACE, some of the material is simply too polite. The scene in which the boozy, over-sexed housewife convinces the young stud to climb up on a ladder to change a bulb, simply fizzled out.  As with so many other great shows that have become tepid films, a terrific video of a hand-selected cast performing the original script in front of a live audience, with Busch in his starring role, would have been preferable.",1015977600,2,877,4.515723270440252
1418220,5,B00005ASPE,"PSYCHO BEACH PARTY is a hilariously camp send-up of everything from BEACH PARTY, GIDGET, ATTACK OF THE 50ft WOMAN, and even Hitchcock's MARNIE!  Based on the Off-Broadway play by acclaimed playwright and drag queen Charles Busch, PSYCHO BEACH PARTY comes to the screen as a campy enjoyable and delightful film.
PSYCHO BEACH PARTY tells the story of young Florence ""Chicklet"" Forrest (Lauren Ambrose).  She and her two girlriends Berdeen (Danni Wheeler) and Marvel Ann (Amy Adams) are enjoying a fairly mundane summer when Chicklet begins having problems...
Chicklet unknowingly suffers from a weird split-personality disorder in which she becomes alter-ego Ann Bowman, a nympho lady-of-the-night intent on becoming the empress of the earth.  Making matters worse is that whenever Chicklet comes back to her senses, someone ends up dead!  Enter Captain Monica Starke (Charles Busch) who attempts to crack the case, but not before coming face-to-face again with old flame The Great Kanaka (Thomas Gibson).
Adding further complications is the vacationing B-movie starlet Bettina Barnes (Kimberley Davies) and two surfer boys who have an unshakable attraction to each other.
Featuring a psychedelic soundtrack complete with bongo drums and go-go girls, PSYCHO BEACH PARTY is ultimate wild ride!",1014249600,7,1290,5.532994923857868

1418222,4,B00005ASPE,"There's trouble down at Malibu Beach in the early Sixties. Sensible Florence Forrester has begun to ignore her trueblue friend Burdene in favor of ""that sleazy beach crowd,"" a group of young surfbums who have taught her to ride the waves and renamed her ""Chicklet."" Florence suffers from strange spells when she's not herself, and becomes a tough femme fatale named Ann Bowman, ""dominatrix-empress of the planet Earth!,"" who likes nothing better than to enunciate her own name melodramatically and to shout orders at her male sex slaves. Florence's mother, a Joan Crawfordesque control freak, won't explain what's up with her troubled daughter. Meanwhile, some of the surfers in Florence's crowd can't seem to keep their hands off one another. And a strange killer is slaughtering people all over the place, striking largely at the physically imperfect...

Charles Busch's successful off-off-Broadway stage play gets the full treatment here and is largely very successful. Very wisely, Busch, who played Chicklet onstage, stepped aside in favor of young Lauren Ambrose, later to be the star of HBO's ""Six Feet Under,"" and cast himself instead as the police detective, Monica Stark, investigating the murders. Monica is such an bercompetent butch detective (with strangely thoughtful facial expressions) that everything Busch does or says is funny. Ambrose tries a bit too hard as Chicklet, but she's quite hilarious when she becomes possessed by the Ann Bowman persona (don't be surprised if afterwards you start reciting some of Ann's better, and more arch, bon mots: ""Bad boys need to be spanked... bad boys need to be TORtured!""). And there's a great frug-off at the beach in the inevitable luau (between the B-starlet Bettina Barnes and Florence's romantic rival Marvel Ann) that is alone worth the price of the video.",1011571200,4,1822,5.2184300341296925

1418225,4,B00005ASPE,"Charles Busch is one of the funniest men on the planet.  In his play ""Die!  Mommie! Die!"" he had me in stitches just walking across the room.
This movie is really funny, and as others have pointed out, Lauren Ambrose is really, really good in this; funny, and very good in doing the different personalities.  But I have to take one star off for not having Charles play the part that he wrote and played on the stage- Chiclet.  Most of the fun is watching this rather tall, handsome guy not only play a 17 year old surfer chick (and her 17 other personalities), but that he is just dead-on.  It's like he trance-channels Sandra Dee!  I NEED to have a DVD of ""Die!  Mommie! Die!""
In any case, this is a very funny movie, a great parody of the beach party movies, 60's Grand Guignol, and the whole ""Scream"" thing.  Nicholas Brendon's description of the perfect date is a highlight.  But at this price, rent,  do not buy.",1007251200,6,917,4.372781065088757

Yeah, I do know why I laughed. It was funny. It wasn't as purile as most modern ""teen"" comedies are, but it sure did have fun poking fun at the 60's beach movies like ""Beach Blanket Bingo"".
Charles Busch, who plays the part of the female detective, is absolutely a laugh riot: I truly believe he was channeling Kathleen Turner. The two hunky doofus boys who are more in love with each other than any of the babes...Nicholas Brendan, in a reverse take on his role on ""Buffy"", plays the major stud puppy here...Thomas Gibson in a reverse take on his televsion role as straight laced ""Greg"", plays a beatnik surfer dude. Beth Broderick, with her unbelievably sexy raspy voice, plays this films version of June Cleever with a twist.
Add to the hilarity of these portrayals, the premise that someone is killing off imperfect kids. So...we've got a beach movie murder? Right? Right! Ridiculous, right? Right! Funny? You bet!
The lines are outrageous. The costumes dead on. The portrayals ridiculous and accurate at the same time.

1418230,3,B00005ASPE,"jeez, this is a crazy movie. Where do I begin?
A few days ago, I saw a preview for this movie on Starz, and it looked like it would be a funny satire of slasher flicks. So, the next time it was on, I decided to watch it. This is easily the strangest, most confusing film I've seen all summer. Overall, it's pretty entertaining, but it's dragged down by strange, dumb, undeveloped characters and the fact that it gets a little boring as it moves along.
The film's protagonist, a girl named Florence wants to fit in with the surfing crowd. It takes a bit, but she finally gets accepted into the crowd, and her new nickname is chicklett. Other characters include her nerdy friend, a slutty girl, an actress hiding away, a snooby weelchairbound girl, the sweedish exchange student, a very odd woman police officer (who happens to be the film's screenwriter, and her mother. However, just as Florence is starting to fit in with the surfers, she relizes something is wrong. She has strange blackouts, that she can't quite understand. However, the blank outs are caused by her being a schizophrenic. Whenever she sees circles, she turns into the evil, snobby Ann Bowman, and whenever she becomes Ann, people get hacked to bits.
The film is fun, and has some great one liners in it. However, there are flaws that cosideribly drag it down. One being is the characters. No one in the group of surfers is particularly developed well, nor are any of the surrounding characters. The only person developed well is Florence, everyone else is about as 3D as a peice of cardboard. Also, the film becomes a bit boring in between the murders. Aside from some entertaining bits, the film dosen't have anything that funny occuring during these parts. Don't even get me started on the acting either...
So, overall, Psycho Beach Party is a somewhat entertaing romp, but will most likely bore most of it's viewers. I only reccomend seeing it if you really want to, otherwise, leave it on the shelf.",997747200,,1974,4.675287356321839
1418231,4,B00005ASPE,"I admit that I'm not familiar with any of Charles Busch's other work, but I'm definitely going to seek it out, now! Although *Psycho Beach Party* wasn't exactly perfect, I definitely give it high points for ambition and just plain hilarious fun!
First of all, I must say that Lauren Ambrose and Beth Broderick were *excellent* in their respective roles as Florence ""Chicklet"" Forrest and Mrs. Forrest. These two actresses suited their roles perfectly--looking like they just stepped out of authentic '60s-era celluloid. I only wish the rest of the cast looked their parts as perfectly--some of the surfer boys coming close. Thomas Gibson seemed *far* too stiff in his role as Kanaka and I couldn't (until I investigated the credits a little more closely) quite figure out why Captain Monica Stark was played by a man (s/he is actually Charles Busch--who wrote the script).
Other than that, I thought it was a terribly ingenious plot with the perfect smattering of funny period characters (the tomboy surfer-girl, her intellectual and bespectacaled friend, the surf-guru, the Donna Reed-esque mother, the runaway starlet, etc.) and vintage settings (the '60s beach, the drive-in movie theatre, the abandoned beach house, etc.).
What makes this otherwise classic beach film parody so funny is the clever and hilarious way in which Busch insinuates contemporary themes like schitzophrenia, repressed homosexuality, S&M enthusiasm, serial killing, etc. into the plot. Let's face it--tomboy surfer girls are just so much funnier when they're suffering from schitzophrenia and might or might not be serial killers!
Despite all this, I will say that the overall theme the film leaves you with is a little heavy-handed--that true perfection never really existed and was only a very thin veneer (even during beatnik luaus in the '60s) and that hating people because they're different is wrong, etc. It does, however, suit its subject matter perfectly. Therefore, run out and rent or buy this movie (or even go see the play if you can--and tell me how it stacks up!) as soon as you can and get some groovy laughs in, baby!",995068800,3,2112,5.106936416184971

While I didn't live in the 50's-70's I know enough about beach movies to get the surf lingo. The movie has so many funny bits you almost forget to look for the killer.
