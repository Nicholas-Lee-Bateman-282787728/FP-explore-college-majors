2914966,5,B000U1ZV7G,"Love all Dracula films but these are  four of my very favorites.  The quality of these older films is fantastic, not like the old VHS format.  Am, as always, very pleased with my order.",1202169600,6,185,4.382352941176471
2914967,5,B000U1ZV7G,"Warner Brothers has released an excellent collection of horror movies from Hammer Studios starring Christopher Lee as Count Dracula.  They span the great gothic era of cinema history.  Released in 1958, ""Horror of Dracula"" was Christopher Lee's first movie as Dracula.  In 1958, the gothic era was begining to surge.  [Mario Bava's gothic masterpiece, ""Black Sunday"" (a.k.a. ""Mask of Satan""),was released in 1960.]  ""Horror of Dracula,"" in my opinion, is the best of this collection beause of its gorgeous settings, and the plot followed Bram Stoker's novel more closely than any other film adaptation of ""Dracula.""  Peter Cushing also starred as Dracula's nemesis, Dr. Van Helsing.  It is always great fun to watch Lee and Cushing battle each other for survival.  ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"" is the least impressive of the four movies.  Dracula victimizes the relatives of a priest who placed a cross on his castle.  Some of the jargon and sexual innuendoes seemed inappropriate for the 1800s setting.  Dracula manaces the priest's niece, played by the beautiful Veronica Carlson who was also delightful to watch in Hammer's ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed.""  The next movie in the collection is ""Taste the Blood of Dracula,"" which is my second favorite movie in the collection.  Three wealthy, seemingly upstanding businessmen have unwittingly relased Dracula after killing his servant.  Dracula seeks revenge by having the three businessmen killed by the hands of their own children who are young adults.  Some of the scenes are rather cruel and gruesome.  Under the spell of the vampire, the children appear to enjoy killing their fathers.  ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" was a wise choice for ending this collection.  In 1972, the gothic era was coming to a close.  Mario Bava had just released his last gothic materpiece, ""Baron Blood.""  ""Dark Shadows,"" the gothic daytime soap opera, had ended its six-year run the year before.  In ""Dracula A.D. 1972,"" Peter Cushing returns as Dr. Van Helsing to battle Dracula once again.  (Cushing was absent from the previous two movies.)  ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" is very dated with its hippie language and songs; however, it is still fun to watch.  I prefer period pieces that are set in the 1800s.  They seem to weather the test of time.  I've noticed that in all four movies, Dracula is always seekng revenge against entire familes even though only one member of the family may have harmed him.  I only wish Warner Brothers would relase more 4 movie collections of Hammer Productions starring Christopher Lee as Dracula, the vampire who, like Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger, can never die.",1201824000,13,2631,5.086448598130841
2914968,5,B000U1ZV7G,"NO movie company EVER gave a more scenic, rustic,*GOTHIC* ambience than HAMMER STUDIOS!. AND!, as lasting and classic as Lugosi was, Christopher Lee was the PERFECT Dracula!. Hammer began it all with ""HORROR OF DRACULA"" in 1958, and it was gory for that time!... Several years passed, and the first sequal was 'DRACULA PRINCE Of DARKNESS {My Favorite,and I NEVER understood why this wasn't on this set instead of A.D 72???}.So outstanding was this 2nd installment, that HAMMER,themselves,realized they had something special!. Only to follow were;'DRACULA HAS RISEN'...,'TASTE THE BLOOD'...,and 'SCARS OF DRACULA{highly UNDERATED!}. Finally;Satanic Rites, and A.D.'72. ... But HAMMER did it right!; Little nuances :>{Lamps on carriages, English Countryside, candles,Castles}!!!.
 It is a horror fans dream to have such timeless movies to go along with outstanding scripts!,and just 'atmospheric' scenery alone boggles!... HAMMER horror is MORE than enough to quench the pallet!; THUS!; to top it all off ! ; *Christopher Lee* IS at his...The VERY BEST !!!!

2915032,5,B000U1ZV7G,"I've just started getting into the Hammer Horror cycle, after glutting on the Universal classics for years. This was a great place to start--4 great movies at a discount price; not too shabby. The first 2 movies of the set were the best--I have trouble picking a favorite between ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave."" Both are great, and ""Risen From the Grave"" has that great controversy about Dracula getting staked, but not dying because an atheist did it & couldn't pray to keep him dead. Reportedly, Lee himself thought it was a bad move, but did it anyway.

""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" - not quite as great as the first 2, but not bad either. And, it's always interesting to see just how they keep bringing Dracula back to life. This time, it was a satanic ritual performed by his servant, who--as the title eludes to--drinks the blood of the Count and resurrects him.

""Dracula A.D. 1972"" - Peter Cushing returns to the series, first as the original Dr. Van Helsing, then in modern day London as his descendant. Another satanic ritual revives Dracula to modern times and the Count seeks to destroy the House of Van Helsing. One of the last times Lee and Cushing squared off in the Hammer Dracula Series and it was a great finish to this particular collection.

If you're a Hammer fan--or were a novice like me--this is a great starting point to get into the Hammer series...",1496966400,4,1403,4.604

Many of the images have etched themselves in my mind, which is a great treat to see again.  The other 2 are pretty mediocre, especially Blood, though AD 72 isn't awful.

The action of Horror and Risen are more or less at the same time.  There is at least one film in between them in terms of chronology, which I was hoping the set contained.  While Blood is supposed to take place at the same time as well, there are blatantly sloppy inconsistencies that ruin if for anyone with a little imagination - it's just junk.  72 does tell a pretty good story, and by the time it was out Drac was no longer cool - it was very fun to see how they supposedly ended the series.

Recommended, more for memories than viewing experience on its own - these are pretty mediocre.",1473984000,,922,4.414201183431953

2915127,3,B000U1ZV7G,"Two part review:
4 Stars for the films: A good collection of  Hammer Dracula films--including their first--but I purchased this 2-disc set to get the one film I could not find by itself: ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" (the other three I already own).  It's one of my favorites of the series, though it's hampered by it's attempt to drive home the fact it takes place in the 1970s with an out-of-place ""mod"" soundtrack and excessive use of 70's slang baby, you dig? At times you almost expect Austin Powers to show up. Which is odd, because I grew up in the 70s, and was exposed to British TV & film from that time period--you don't need to purposely dress teenagers as hippies to tell when the film was made :) Overall, an imaginative plot and the ""prequel"" to the last Dracula film with Christopher Lee ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" released after this one.

2 Stars for the DVD: Although the film transfers look great, the physical DVD was a bit disappointing. It was a cut-out (bargain) DVD, with a gash cut in the plastic case & cover and the DVD for ""Dracula 1972"" had a big scratch on it. It was shrink-wrapped, but the plastic DVD cover was very ""wrinkly"" (see photos). Amazon Prime purchases should have more accurate descriptions, like 3rd-party sellers, describing the condition of the item.",1466294400,5,1291,4.62882096069869

2915129,5,B000U1ZV7G,"They just don't make them like this anymore. These are the Hammer Draculas that Warner has the rights to, if you're wondering why some are missing. The others are owned by various companies and I believe Satanic Rites is public domain. Anyway, yeah, buy this if you don't own the movies individually yet. Only downside is the flipper discs get scratched very easily.

The first 3 films are set in the late 19th century and A.D. 1972 is obviously set in 1972, even though it starts out in the Victorian age as well. Peter Cushing is in 2 of the movies, Christopher Lee is in all of them.",1464912000,3,586,4.425925925925926

2915186,4,B000U1ZV7G,"The Dracula franchise starring Christopher Lee used to be the most terrifying and successful among Hammer Film's horror factory.
In fact Hammer Film Productions used to be akin to Horror Films in the 1960-70 era. Their Dracula series was very popular and Christopher Lee was the quintessential Dracula and thus was typecast in Hammer movies despite being a good actor. In fact his role as a Bond villain in 'The Man with the Golden Gun' was a casting coup based on his fame as Dracula.

This DVD has four of his outings as Dracula ( without Dracula,Prince of Darkness,Satanic Rites of Dracula and Scars of Dracula).

The print transfer is adequate and can be watched satisfactorily even on a 4K TV.

Horror of Dracula, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, and Taste the Blood of Dracula are all easy to find ... but it's more difficult to find a copy of DRACULA A.D. 1972.

2915383,5,B000U1ZV7G,"Classic vampire flicks. They don't make'em like this anymore, and it's a shame. There seems to be no good actors in horror movies anymore, and Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were to of the greats.",1395187200,,199,4.714285714285714
2915384,5,B000U1ZV7G,"A brief run-down will follow:
""Horror of Dracula""--this one is a classic and deserves its reputation. Lee is my favorite Count, despite some purists complaining that he is too handsome for the role and that he shouldn't have blood dripping from his teeth (please!).
""Dracula has Risen from the Grave""--this one is a personal favorite. I like the story about an atheistic young man learning to believe in the mysteries of ancient superstitions, by way of coming across the Count. As good as an entry as you'll find from the Hammer vampire archives, this one is always entertaining, with many beautiful women on display, and a lot of creepy atmosphere (this is one horror film that understands HOW atmosphere is supposed to be used, building tension rather than simply layers of fog).
""Taste the Blood of Dracula""--this one is not as tasty as its title promises. Nonetheless, the Satanic ritual angle is somewhat fresh, but no less disgusting, and the Count is underused in this one. Not at all in the vein of the classic stories concerning the Count; Lee is good here, but he's used differently, and the story is dark without being terribly scary. This is a C- effort if anything.
""Dracula, A. D., 1972""--Despite its intriguing premise concerning an allegory of the Highgate Vampire case (check your records), this one is simply parody. Good to see Peter Cushing back on board, but this is an even more pathetic entry, still a good black magic/Devil worship ceremony set-up (to invoke all of the ghastly ghouls back into the empirical world of the 70's), but nothing much revelatory about the ending. Cushing is good here, but even he can't save the grotesque deformity that is the script for this item. Stoker's ""Dracula"" was about modern science being able to combat disease and viral plague by way of re-interpreting old superstitions in a modern (maybe secularized?) way--there is nothing in this film that cares about vampire mythology, so you're pretty much stuck with a fairly good cast but not much else in terms of story development.
Overall, the DVD is very good though, and one can't beat the purchase for the price. The first disc is obviously the better but it's worth the price tag to get 4 (now hard to find) film classics. If you like horror titles, you need this set! The picture and sound transfers are very good (much improved image compared with the grainy VHS releases from years back), and the double-sided discs do not bother me that much.

2915403,3,B000U1ZV7G,"Two of these films are what I would consider Hammer classics: ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave.""  The other two, well, let's just say they are not classics.  I have fond memories of ""Dracula Has Risen..."" from childhood, spending late nights catching the film on local networks. I particularly enjoy the musical score, plus the overall performances of the cast.  ""Horror of Dracula"" is also fun for me, not least because two of the actors from my favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"" (1951, with Alastair Sim), are in it: the actors who play Lucy and the undertaker.  It's pretty amazing given Mr. Lee's sonorous voice that he was not given more dialogue, but his Dracula was always about gettin' fed and then dispatching any knuckleheads who got in his way.",1384819200,,786,4.8

But I was really impressed by the picture and audio quality of the DVD, and in a mere $9.99 price and you can't beat it. I highly, highly recommend for Hammer horror fans.",1371772800,,493,4.125
2915424,5,B000U1ZV7G,I thought this was an awesome set. Lee does a great job as Dracula. The best Dracula in my humble opinion. Horror of Dracula was awesome. It's the best movie in the set. It is my favorite Dracula movie. Cushing does a great job in Horror of Dracula. I thought his performance was exceptional and a great Van Helsing. Lee's performance was iconic. My second favorite Dracula movie in this set is Dracula 1972 it is the final showdown between Lee and Cushing. I found the movie to be so cool because the seventies were very different from the late fifties when the first time Lee and Cushing did battle. There is something about the atmosphere in a new generation that makes you really enjoy this movie because you know a new generation is introduced to Lee and Cushing. It was a great movie and I thought Lee and Cushing were in top form. My next favorite was Dracula Has Risen From The Grave. It had a great opening and a fine effort by a supporting cast. Lee does great in it as always. Taste The Blood of Dracula was not in my top five favorite Lee Dracula movies but I don't think Lee ever gave a bad performance of Dracula. I think horror movie fans will love this set. If you are just starting to get into vampire movies. I recommend this set and get Dracula Prince of Darkness which also stars Christopher Lee as the Count. Cheers!,1370131200,,1337,4.373493975903615

2915426,3,B000U1ZV7G,"Horror of Dracula was the first of the Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee collaborations...and Hammer Films jump into the world of Vampirism.  Christopher Lee shows both sides of his character, one being the civilized; charming; and hospitable lord of the manner...and the other Dracula the Vampire lusting after the taste of human blood.  Horror of Dracula and Dracula Prince of Darkness are undeniably, in my opinion,  Hammer Studios two greatest achievements...bar none!
Dracula Has Risen From the Grave, though not quite as good as the previous two films, is certainly worth watching.  It deals with a young man and woman in love; a doting mother; and her brother the priest, who is concerned about his niece's spiritual well being and safety, as her boyfriend is a self proclaimed Atheist.  In this movie Dracula has defiled the town parish with the murder of a young village woman in God's House...and has found a new minion in a young priest, who has lost his faith and turned to drink.  Though he (the young priest) wants to break free of Dracula, he cannot and unwillingly seeks out new victims for the Prince of Darkness.  Anything in between or at the end of this movie you can discover for yourselves!
Taste the Blood of Dracula centers around three older gentlemen who are living a life of debauchery, but even those pleasures are not enough to satisfy their needs.  In hopes of discovering new pleasures they enlist the aid of a young aristocrat, who is heavy into the occult and promises them pleasures beyond compare...but first requires each man to drink the rehydrated blood of Count Dracula.  In the course of events they kill the man, and Dracula seeks vengeance against those who killed his servant.
Dracula A.D. 1972 is the world of Vampires meets the mod squad pitting the heir Laurence Van Helsing and his Grand Daughter Jessica against Count Dracula.  Christopher Lee after his third movie portraying Dracula the Prince of Darkness, probably should have stepped away from the role as the scare factor is almost non existent by then!  (Still a rating of 3 stars overall...and not a bad investment for a small chunk of change!)",1366070400,2,2145,4.897790055248619

 1. ""Horror Of Dracula"" (1958): The one that started the Hammer/Dracula series is the best of the four films collected here. Christopher Lee debuts as Dracula; and Peter Cushing also debuts as Dracula's  arch-nemesis Van Helsing. ""Horror"" was the first time that Bram Stoker's original novel was filmed in color. It hardly matters that Jimmy Sangster's screenplay is a rather loose adaptation of Stoker's novel. The film moves along at an exciting pace, and packs a lot of incidents and action into 81 minutes. This version, for instance, wastes no time with meek Jonathan Harker ""discovering"" that Count Dracula is a vampire. Harker (John Van Eyssen) knows all about Dracula at the outset, and, posing as a librarian, arrives at Castle Dracula to destroy him. After he kills Dracula's vampire bride (Valerie Gaunt), Harker is turned into a vampire; presumably by Dracula himself. ""Horror"" is notable for its restraint. A lot of what happens is left to the viewer's imagination. With Harker a member of the ""undead"", it is up to Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) to save both Lucy (Carol Marsh) and Mina (Melissa Stribling) from a similar fate. The final showdown, with Dracula disintegrating after being exposed to direct sunlight, is especially memorable.
  2. ""Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"" (1968): He certainly has, and he has vowed revenge on the Monsignoir (Rupert Davis  who placed a very large cross in front of his Castle! Employing a weak-wlled parish priest (Ewan Hopper) as his slave, Dracula intends to put his fangs into the Monsignoir's virginal niece Maria (Veronica Carlson). First, however, Dracula puts the bite on Zina (Barbara Ewing), a particularly lusty and busty red-haired barmaid. Zina seems a bit too anxious to become a ""vampire bride"", and jealous of Dracula's lust for Maria. ""What do you want HER for?"", Zina screams, ""YOU HAVE ME!!""). Sorry, Zina. Christopher Lee's Dracula obviously prefers virginal blondes. He also doesn't like screeching, demanding women who impede his progress! Maria's finacee Paul (Barry Andrews) could efficiently save her from Dracula's influence-- except he is an atheist and can't bring himself to say a prayer at a crucial moment. In the end, Dracula is impaled on the very large cross that made him so angry at the beginning. One of the better Hammer ""Dracula"" films.
  3. ""Taste The Blood Of Dracula"" (1970):  After a dispute with Christopher Lee, Hammer Studios planned to continue the series with Ralph Bates as Lord Courtley, a new vampire. Warner Bros., however, refused to distube the film without Lee's participation.  An arrangement was hastily made. The result being that Lee's Dracula only makes brief appearances;  being so hastily inserted into the plot. The plot,  beginning with Roy Kinneer literally stumbling onto the final scene of ""Risen"", with Dracula impaled on the very large cross  however,  is intriguing; and the pace and the main performances are very good.
 ""Would you sell your soul to the Devil?,""  the hedonistic Lord Courtley  asks three middle-aged  hypocrites  at a brothel. Lord Courtley actually does taste the blood of Dracula (from a very large goblet). Things don't go as planned, however. The three middle-aged hypocrites freak out and beat Lord Courtley to death. The blood-drinking, however, has resurrected Dracula, who vows revenge for the murder of his devoted disciple. Linda Hayden and Isla Blair are featured as the ladies on Dracula's ""Bite List"" this time.
  4. ""Dracula A.D. !972"" proves that vampires and hippies don't mix. This appaling attempt to ""modernize"" the Dracula story (by taking it out of the usual, much more appropriate Victorian or Edwardian era settings) finds Dracula incongruisly resurrected  by some pleasure-seeking hippies in the Chelsea District of London. At least the dangerously sexy Christopher Neame (the BBC's ""Romeo And Juliet"") is perfectly cast as Dracula's disciple John Alucard (that's Dracula spelled backwards!!). Neame obviously decided to go for broke and go delirously over the top with his performance. Neame's ""Black Mass Scene"" is a delightful hoot! ""Dynasty's"" Stephanie Beacham (wearing a hideous long blonde hair-do and even worse early 1970's ""fashions"") is featured as Jessica Van Helsing.
Peter Cushing returns to the Series as Van Helsing. Jessica's Grandfather; and the Grandson of the original Van Helsing he portrayed in ""Horror Of Dracula."" By now, Christopher Lee's Dracula only makes cameo appearances. The confrontation between Alucard and Van Helsing is a campy highlight. ""Where is Jessica?"", Van Helsing demans to know. ""You'll never finds her! YOU CAN ROT IN HELL,"" Alucard screams as he dies in the bath-tub.",1318723200,5,4923,5.220812182741117

2915474,2,B000U1ZV7G,"You can tell by reading the other reviews that the Hammer Dracula series has quite a cult following. These films have the distinct honor of being the first Dracula films in color, but offer little else. Hammer was working on an incredibly low budget when they made these films, and it shows.

The directing and acting is all pretty solid for these films. Christopher Lee's Dracula has become nearly as iconic as Lugosi's, but in the beginning he comes off a bit dry (Horror of Dracula) but he catches his stride with the other films using his distinctive and imposing voice. Also Lee doesn't have many lines in any of these films, and his role gets smaller and smaller with each new film.

The budget has an averse effect on a number of aspects of the film. All of the costumes look like they were taken from the wardrobe from a High School play, certainly not something you'd see in a major motion picture. Even Dracula looks like he's wearing a cheap Halloween costume, complete with cheesy makeup. Dracula can't transform (likely would've cost too much for the effects). The blood is really bright, and looks a lot more like paint or tomato juice. What few effects they try to make is very poorly done, using a series of fade away effects that are blurry and just plain ugly. The best effect is in the finale of Horror of Dracula. The sets suffer for this as well. The interior of Dracula's Castle for instance looks like a terrible cheap stage (again, like it was ripped from a high school play). It lacks all of the character and detail Universal's classic had.

The story in the films has been changed significantly from any previous incarnations of Dracula (to the point of which it's almost a new film). As I mention Dracula's shapeshifting is gone, in these films his only powers are hypnotism and his immortality. Many of the names have been switched around, and many of the basic elemets are recycled throughout each of the films (almost to the point of which it feels like you've been watching the same movie over and over). Each movie is packed with tons of B-Movie cheese, if you're into that stuff.

The exception would be Dracula 1972 A.D. which is packed with 70's disco super cheese. It's really, really bad. If you grew up in the 70's it will probably be a great nostalgia trip. For the rest of us, it's painful. Even if you're into the usual low-budget fair then the last film may prove to be just that bad.

In the end it boils down to this. The films aren't as good as the classic Universals, but they are in color. They also aren't as good as the more recent Dracula films (except perhaps for the Dracula 2000 series). It's really a set for collectors only, members of the large cult following. In comparison to the horror genre in general, even for the time, these films are inferior to most.",1291161600,4,2816,4.535433070866142

As for the Horror of Dracula, I rate it Two Stars because the second Half was slow.
It's the Bram Stroker story with some liberties taken which at first make it better. But doesn't work in the second half. There is no Fritz character, and Lee doesn't get any good lines like Bela got. for instance ""Listen to them, children of the night, what music they make."" This movie shows no neck biting or any blood. Some horror movies don't need gore because they have a great story and atmosphere and good acting. This movie had good acting, but the story is weak and they spend too much time with the good guys, namely Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and the annoying Arthur Holmwood,(played by (Michael Gough who played Alfred in the Batman Movies in wich he's great). This can't compare to the Bela Legosi movie. It's just too slow. But just wait for the next two movies and you'll be happy!

Dracula Has Risen From The Grave is a really fun and well acted Hammer Movie with Creepy Atmosphere to spare! A lot of the story takes place on rooftops that link the neighborhood and it's a great effect. Christopher Lee is Great and so is Barbara Ewing as Zena, the Bar Maid. It's never dull and has one of the best endings in any vampire movie that I've seen. A Three and a Half star movie!

And now to Taste the Blood of Dracula. This movie is just great entertainment and really creepy. Wonderful gothic sets and great photography. I love the dark tone from the three aristocratic men who delve into the dark arts only to regret it. Ralph Bates is a bit over the top as Lord Courtly, but  that works well in his final scene! This movie, like Dracula Has Risen From the Grave, has 1960's social commentary. The young College Educated man (Anthony Paxton as Paul) is hated by the his girlfriend's dad (Geoffrey Keen as William Hargood). Plus Hargood is hypocritical in his Christianity. So it's youth against the establishment, and the establishment is messing things up (by ressurecting Count Dracula!) I give this movie four stars!

2915481,5,B000U1ZV7G,"This nice little four pack is a great introduction to Hammer horror movies, which are admittedly an acquired taste today.  When the Hammers came out in the 50's to 70's they were notorious for being shocking (showing --gasp!--blood!).  Needless to say, they will seem tame to a modern audience.

On the other hand, we don't get the graphic excess of today's horror movies, and there is a vitality to the proceedings missing from the stage-based look of the Universal predecessors.  Dracula doesn't just strike a pose when stalking a victim--he runs across a room and lunges at him.  Van Helsing  would similarly scamper over a table to get his stake into a vampire.

A big plus is that the Hammer Dracula films feature one or both of two of the best character actors ever - Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.

Be aware that the fantasy side of things is toned down.  Dracula doesn't turn into a bat or cling to walls, for instance.

Finally, The quality of the movies is not consistent.  ""Horror of Dracula"" is by far the standout, and by the time things get to ""1972"", inspiration (and the interest of the actors) has fallen considerably.  Still, for four movies this is a great price.",1266192000,9,1186,4.676328502415459
2915492,4,B000U1ZV7G,"Usually I have to pass on these inexpensive Warner Brothers four-movie collections that have popped up lately, as I either have no interest in the movies offered (the ""Police Academy"" compilation, for instance), or I already own one or more of the movies in the set.  Finally, though, with this cool ""Dracula"" offering, there were four movies that I didn't own and was actually interested in seeing.

All four of these old Hammer Studios (Hammer was affiliated with Warner Brothers) ""Dracula"" films are engaging fun, often shocking and scary, too.  Of course, I was immediately struck by the fact that Christopher Lee's Dracula really doesn't have much to do in any of them.  Basically, his rarely-speaking character is there to set the story in motion, appear once or twice throughout, and then show up at the end to bring it to a close.  The four movies devote much more of their attention to the activities of the characters surrounding Dracula, which is actually sort of interesting.

Though I liked these movies a lot overall, I have to point out one ludicrous (but nonetheless entertaining) sequence in ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave!"", the second film in this set.  In this movie, Dracula is actually revived by a priest stumbling around in the forest who trips, bumps his head on a rock, and falls unconscious. Blood from his head wound then trickles onto the surface of the frozen creek under him, drips down through a crack in the ice, and into the lips of a frozen Dracula, who just happens to be directly under where the priest tripped!  The trickle of blood revives Dracula for that particular movie.  Amazing!  Oh, I should mention that the priest was actually in the forest BECAUSE of Dracula (he was on a mission to sanctify Dracula's castle, to make it unusable for the vampire in the event he ever tried to return to it), so it was really unlucky that the priest decided to trip- after traveling hours through the forest- RIGHT ABOVE THE SPOT where Dracula's corpse was frozen in the ice.  I thought that was really funny.

Anyway, aside from that head-scratching moment, the stories here are mostly solid, the prints are sharp and clean, and there are even a few modest extras (mostly in the form of the films' trailers).  If you enjoy horror movies of years past, you can't go wrong with this entertaining set, especially considering the price.",1264982400,3,2367,4.772058823529412

2915498,4,B000U1ZV7G,"One of the great joys of growing up with the Hammer horror films was the ""continuity"" from film to film.  Unfortunately, I am too young to have seen these films while they were being released, and too old to not have seen them before the multi-movie capabilities of DVD sets.  I saw all the Hammer films as they aired on tv, usually in the middle of the night, sometimes on Saturday afternoons, but out of order, and some films more than others.

Not that I brood over this, but it has irritated me all these years that I saw Dracula Has Risen From the Grave multiple times before I saw Dracula: Prince of Darkness. It's not so bad with the other sequels, but the end to Dracula: Prince of Darkness is perfect to the way he got resurrected in Dracula Has Risen From the Grave.  With this four film set of DVD's, again I am deprived of seeing the second and third Count Dracula stories back to back (Brides of Dracula was the second film in the Hammer series, but did not have Dracula as a character).  Yes, I am spiteful enough to drop the ratings by one star because of this.  That said, Dracula A.D, 1972 is a satisfactory selection for the fourth film in this set, since it 1) has the Dracula/Van Helsing battle in a modern setting, and 2) teams up Christopher Lee with Peter Cushing.

Like I wrote in the BBC adaptation of Dracula, my taste has clearly changed since I was a kid, so watching this collection wasn't as enjoyable as watching them on broadcast televison whenever they aired.

For me, though, Horror of Dracula has passed the test of time. The plot is really nowhere near the novel, but the film was more action packed than the novel and the 1931 Universal version, and the relationship between Lee's Dracula and Cushing's Van Helsing is so powerful, that you would think that all the Dracula films had these two battling - but it would be 14 years before they appeared in another Dracula movie together.

One of the reasons why Dracula A.D. is a smart addition to this set is that it was the first teaming of Lee and Cushing since the first film.  It takes place a hundred years after the last Van Helsing/Dracula battle, Dracula had been carrying this grudge against the Van Helsings all these years, just waiting to be resurrected and lo and behold, the grandson and grandfather look exactly alike.  This movie works only because the first movie establishes such a strong chemistry between the two, and it's nice to have both available in the same set.  You can watch the first and last movie and get a sort of ""continuity.""  As for this movie as stand alone - it's really dated and although the plot had potential, the execution of the idea was lacking.

As for the other two films that make up this set, I had always thought Dracula Has Risen From the Grave was the weakest of the 19th century stories (maybe because I'd seen it so many times), but rather enjoyed it this time around.  In a way, it's a rather intellectual film. The protagonist is an athiest and as much as a ""B"" horror film can, it examines the issue of strengths of faith and love when having to destroy vampires.

Taste the Blood of Dracula has a circle of three friends being targeted by Dracula because they had killed his servant.  He uses the children of the men to kill their fathers.  I can't remember if I liked it as a kid, but I didn't like it as an adult.  Dracula has no loyalties except to himself, and to get his intended victims' children to do the dirty work for him?  Neither approach worked for me.

Bottom line, it's a nice set of four films.  For five stars, I'd have had it include Dracula: Prince of Darkness, and if the replacement had been other than Dracula A.D. 1972, I would have dropped this set down to three stars.  Admittedly, I didn't get as much enjoyment as I thought I would from these four films, but it was nostalgic to see see vampire horror without current special effects and you really can't do much (if any) better than a battle between characters played by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing - and you get two of them here.",1248566400,4,4056,4.436657681940701

The one thing I did wonder is why they didn't include the second Dracula instalment, i.e. Dracula Prince of Darkness [which by the way is being sold by third parties here on Amazon for exorbitant amounts].

Horror of Dracula
""Horror of Dracula"" may not be a faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic Gothic vampire tale, in fact far from it, but it is a fine take of Stoker's novel. In this version, Jonathan Harker goes to Dracula's castle at the beginning under the guise of a librarian, but he actually knows what Dracula is and his purpose is to destroy him. Unfortunately, he is killed by Dracula and the vampire goes to London to prey upon Harker's fiancee, Lucy Holmwood [yes, they changed the names too], and later on Mina Holmwood, Lucy's sister-in-law. It is left to Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and Arthur Holmwood [Lucy's brother and Mina's husband] to destroy the monster.

Christopher Lee, in his first portrayal of the evil Count Dracula, may not have much screen time, but he makes the most of the limited time he does have. His Count is sensual and evil at the same time - exerting a hypnotic effect upon his female victims that have them eagerly disrobing for the count's pleasure [and fangs:)].

Peter Cushing does an amazing job as Dr Van Helsing, vampire hunter and his commanding presence and determination to hunt down and destroy the monster that is Dracula is so credibly done that I was cheering him on all through the movie.

The female victims are suitably beautiful and helpless in the face of Dracula's charm and manipulations, and though this movie doesn't exactly scream big budget, I thought the production values were pretty decent - the vivid colors, the sets and scenery all enhanced the movie experience. There is a genuine atmosphere of menace that is effectively conveyed via the creepy score and sets.

Dracula Has Risen From the Grave
Though there are mixed reactions to ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"", I personally found it to be very interesting and thought-provoking. The story here begins with the little village in which Castle Dracula is located. It's been a year since the count's reign of terror ended, and yet mysterious events still plague the villagers. When the Monsignor [Rupert Davies] returns for a routine visit, he finds the villagers cowering in fear, including the Parish Priest himself [Ewan Hooper]. When the Monsignor undertakes to exorcise the Castle once and for all, events transpire differently - an unfortunate cut on the Priest's head proves to be the nourishment that brings the Count back to life, though the Monsignor remains oblivious of this fact, returning to his own village. The Count and his now faithful servant, the priest follow hot on the Monsignor's heels, bent on revenge - the target being the Monsignor's lovely niece, Maria [Veronica Carlson]. It's left to the Monsignor and Maria's atheist boyfriend, Paul [Barry Andrews] to save Maria before it's too late.

The production values in this movie were actually quite good - the sets, the score, and cinematography all enhanced the storytelling and made this movie very dark and menacing [the cellar under the inn where the Count is forced to reside looks very authentic].

The acting was good - Christopher Lee returns as the Count and this time, he is really mad and bent on revenge, with more screen time and dialogue to convey his anger. His lust for his prey is convincingly portrayed as usual and the female victims once again fall hopelessly under his spell, baring their necks in anticipation of the Count's 'embrace'. Rupert Davies is also strong in his portrayal of the Monsignor and special mention needs to be made of Ewan Hooper's fallen priest. His guilt and conflict comes across as genuine, and this was one aspect of the movie that made it really good for me - the corruption of good by Dracula, and the test of faith in both the Priest and also the atheist Paul.

Taste the Blood of Dracula
This is the fourth instalment in Hammer productions' Dracula series. The storyline is quite unique in that it centers on a group of middle-aged businessmen who inadvertently cause the Count to be resurrected via an occult ritual conducted by a young nobleman, Courtley. They kill Courtley during the ritual, and leave in a hurry, not realising that by committing murder, they have not only caused Dracula to rise again, but awakened his anger. Dracula is bent on revenge for his acolyte's death and proceeds to kill the trio off by manipulating their children.

The acting in this movie was actually pretty good. Christopher Lee reprises his role as the evil Count and actually has quite a few lines of dialogue here, all delivered in his usual deadpan style. His blood- red eyes and demented expressions are all portrayed with chilling effect. The three doomed men are also played really well - Geoffrey Keen as William Hargood, Peter Sallis as Samuel Paxton, and John Carson as Jonathan Secker are all believable in their roles as lecherous middle-aged men whose lust eventually lead to their downfall. The two girls who play Dracula's victims, Linda Hayden as Alice Hargood and Isla Blair as Lucy Paxton are suitably beautiful and do their roles justice.

I thought the production values were above average - the score was effectively creepy, and the sets were well-done, especially the derelict chapel that is the scene of Dracula's resurrection and also the final battle.

Dracula A.D. 1972
Dracula A.D. 1972 is a campy instalment in the Dracula series made by Hammer Films. The gist of the movie is that Dracula gets resurrected in 1972 by a young acolyte, Johnny Alucard and seeks to destroy the remaining Van Helsings, i.e. Dr Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and his beautiful, hippie granddaughter Jessica [Stephanie Beacham].

Though Christopher Lee reprises his role as the malevolent count, his screen time is quite limited and I felt too much screen time was wasted on portraying the debauchery and free-swinging lifestyle of 70s Hippie culture - drugs, sex and rock n roll. But, when he does appear, Lee is magnetic as the count and doesn't disappoint in his performance.

But the best performance in this movie is Peter Cushing's 20th century Van Helsing - he is assured, intelligent and above-all single-minded in his determination to save his granddaughter Jessica from the vampire's clutches. Stephanie Beacham is luscious to look at and feisty in her portrayal as the strong-willed Jessica.

The rest of the actors were ho-hum - a bit overdone in some instances [the guy who played Johnny Alucard for example].

All in all, this isn't a great Dracula movie, but it isn't the worst either.

Final Verdict - this is a set worth owning for fans of Dracula movie and the vampire genre/classic horror.",1226361600,12,6950,4.882103477523325

2915528,4,B000U1ZV7G,"Skipping the Hammer sequels Warners don't have the rights to - the Christopher Lee-free Brides of Dracula, Dracula Prince of Darkness, Scars of Dracula and The Satanic Rites of Dracula - this is nonetheless an excellent collection of some of the best in the series.

Hammer's groundbreaking 1958 version of Dracula (aka Horror of Dracula) is still one of the very best despite the many liberties Jimmy Sangster's concise and highly effective script takes with Bram Stoker's novel to whittle it down to an hour-and-a-half. It's not just the names that have been changed around and the cast of characters greatly reduced to Hammer's budget levels (admirably disguised here by Bernard Robinson's excellent production design). John Van Eyssen's Jonathan Harker is no longer a lawyer, but here is posing as a librarian to get into Dracula's castle with an ulterior motive - presumably on the grounds that the audience knows going in just what Dracula is so there's no point putting the hero through all that mystery when there's staking to be done. The budget doesn't stretch to the voyage and arrival of the ghost ship Demeter or even a Renfield for that matter, and this Dracula has no social interaction with his intended victims in Whitby or London - in fact, he never even leaves the continent. Nor is the vampire fascinated with Harker's intended - here he simply seeks her out as revenge. Yet the changes work surprisingly well, and even throws in a few good twists like the location of Dracula's hiding place.

Although he doesn't have much screen time, Christopher Lee is inspired casting, a feral, vicious creature rather than a Eurotrash smoothie while a very agile Peter Cushing makes a surprisingly physical Van Helsing, the final fight between the good doctor and the evil count surprisingly energetic and violent before the best of the studio's ashes to ashes, dust-to-dust finales. Although rather sedate by today's standards, this film still has a surprising degree of energy and it's easy to see why it made had such a profound impact on the horror genre for decades to come. The first colour version of the tale, it made a big selling point of being able to see the blood in all its vivid hues of red, although it also makes much play on the vampire's female victims being absolutely gagging for it (perhaps not so surprising with Peter Cushing and Michael Gough as the male leads), setting the groundwork for the tits'n'fangs formula that would become the studio's bread and butter over the next couple of decades. A surprisingly cheap picture, thanks to Bernard Robinson's elegant production design and fine direction from Terence Fisher before the drink got to him, it never looks cheap: if anything, it's rather seductively good looking. Unfortunately this is slightly compromised by Warners' widescreen DVD, which feels overcropped at 1.85:1 (the film was intended to be shown in 1.66:1) and there's also a slight wobble at the end of the closing credits.

For the US release of Hammer's fourth Dracula film (only the third to actually feature Christopher Lee, the Count sitting out Brides of Dracula), Warner Bros. used a one-sheet of a woman's neck with a sticking plaster on it, following the title Dracula Has Risen From the Grave with the single word 'Obviously.' The film itself, however, is anything but tongue-in-cheek, and played deadly straight with a conviction the series gradually lost over the years. It's probably the best-looking of all the Hammer Dracula sequels, and also the first where Christopher Lee actually speaks. As usual he's almost a background figure for much of the film, with the bulk of the film carried by Barry Andrews' atheist student romancing Veronica Carlson's niece of Rupert Davies' Monsignor, who inadvertently starts the blood flowing again when his attempt to exorcise Dracula's castle only results in the Count being revived from his icy grave by blood from a convenient cut. Finding himself cast out of his home and aided by Ewan Hooper's terrified priest (Renfield presumably being otherwise engaged), Dracula determines to take his revenge on Davies and his kin, stopping off en route for a light snack with Barbara Ewing's busty redheaded barmaid.

With a prologue that takes place before Dracula, Prince of Darkness and the main body of the film taking place a year later, it takes some liberties with the vampire mythology: the revived Dracula's first appearance is as a reflection, he has no problem removing crosses from willing girls' necks while a stake alone is no longer enough to kill him: you have to pray as well, which is a bit of a problem when your hero doesn't believe in God. Yet they're not as jarring as they might be, the latter resulting in one particularly memorably gory sequence. The change in director from Terence Fisher, sadly in decline at that time and unavailable due to a car crash, to Freddie Francis gives the film less of a production-line feel than most of the studio's Dracula series and, despite an awkward filter in some scenes and a distinctly jaundiced look for the Count, the film has a much more expansive look and feel almost unique in the series, with a striking and well-employed rooftop set courtesy of undervalued production designer Bernard Robinson and some relatively unfamiliar Pinewood standing sets rather than the overused backlot at Bray. He gets good performances too, with a particularly nice turn from Michael Ripper as an amiable innkeeper (as opposed to his usual miserable and terrified innkeepers).

Unfortunately while the DVD boasts excellent colour and definition, some shots look oddly distorted, as if stretched, and the sound wanders in and out of synch far too often for comfort. On the plus side it does restore the censor cuts of about half a dozen gallons of blood spurting from Dracula's chest after he gets staked and includes the original trailer.

Taste the Blood of Dracula follows on so directly from Dracula Has Risen From the Grave that, after one particularly bizarre piece of deus ex machina that borders on the inspired, it begins with Roy Kinnear literally stumbling into the last scene of the movie. On a less welcome note it also marks the point at which an increasingly reticent Christopher Lee was reduced to a cameo figure as the Count - it's not until the halfway point that he's resurrected in a less than convincing display of special effects. Until then much of the film is carried, and rather well, by Geoffrey Keen's Bible-bashing strict disciplinarian Victorian dad, the kind of man you can set your watch by as he sets off to do `charity work' in the East End with his respectable friends John Carson and Peter Sallis saving fallen women - about two each once a month in Roy Hudd's brothel discreetly located in the backrooms of a soup kitchen. It's there that he and his pals are surprised playing horsie by Ralph Bates' dissolute disinherited aristo who has sold his soul to the Devil and offers to broker the same deal for them if they'll buy Dracula's cape and blood for him, reasoning that ""Having tried everything that your narrow imaginations can suggest, you're bored to death with it all, right?"" Naturally it all ends badly with Bates getting a severe case of indigestion after drinking the blood of the title and getting kicked to death by his new friends, conveniently providing Dracula with a new body and a new mission - to destroy all three men through their children (a typical role-call of amply-bosomed totty, future BBC regulars and supporting actors who never made it to the major leagues in the forms of Linda Hayden, Isla Blair, Martin Jarvis and Anthony Higgins in the days when he was still calling himself Anthony Corlan) while Michael Ripper's ineffectual detective displays a pronounced lack of interest in the mounting body count.

The idea of the sins of the fathers being revenged by their children is a good one, offering both a neat twist and a reason for Lee's extremely limited screen time that keeps him very much to the sidelines until the disappointing finale, but it's certainly one of the more entertaining sequels and, a couple of lapses such as the resurrection scene aside, boasts superior and atmospheric direction from Peter Sasdy with some surprisingly graceful camerawork. It's also the last of the Hammer Draculas that looks like they spent some money on it - when they churned out Scars of Dracula the same year, it looked like they'd spent all their money on this one and had only pocket change and whatever was left over in the studio wardrobe for that!

Warner's DVD offers a good widescreen transfer with the original trailer as the only extra.

For reasons known only to the author, Bram Stoker's Dracula never included the line ""Sergeant, I'll bet you a pound to a pinch of s*** that there's a little piece of hash at that party, and if there is, I've got them."", but the early 70s saw that particular oversight put right. Dracula A.D. 1972 saw Hammer trying to pump new life into the old Count with a new creative team whose big idea was basically to rehash the plot of Taste the Blood of Dracula in the 1970s with Christopher Neame in the Ralph Bates role as Johnny Alucard, here conning a thrill-seeking group of with it kids (Michael Kitchen and Caroline Munro among them) into making a date with the Devil with a Black Mass at the deconsecrated church that not only holds Lawrence Van Helsing's body (Lawrence? Whatever happened to Abraham?) and Dracula's ashes. ""Okay, okay. But if we do get to summon up the big daddy with the horns and the tail, he gets to bring his own liquor, his own bird and his own pot.""

As with the Godzilla films, the main attraction is kept off the screen for most of the running time - top-billed Christopher Lee's role is probably smaller in this than any other in the series, four brief scenes probably totalling no more than ten minutes. Worse still, looking more like Peter Sellers than Transylvanian aristocracy, he brings nothing except continuity to the part: he does what is asked of him with professionalism, but that's about it. Instead the bulk of the film is carried by Neame's Malcolm McDowell wannabe, second-billed Peter Cushing as Van Helsing's grandson Lorimar, Stephanie Beacham and Michael Coles' open-minded cop (""There is a Satan."" ""Of course. Otherwise we wouldn't need a police force, would we?""). Yet despite the clumsily handled prologue and finale it's fairly entertaining even if it is completely derivative, perhaps even more entertaining now than when it was released because its hip and happening trappings are far funnier than the intentional comic relief - not least Johnny Alucard urging ""Dig the music, kids!"" during the black mass - and it's a lot better than Dracula 2000.

The DVD also includes the wonderfully over the top trailer - ""Are you ready? He's ready. He's waiting to freak you out - right out of this world!"" - but not the short making of documentary from when the picture was still called Dracula Today (other rejected titles included Dracula Chases the Mini Girls and Dracula Chelsea '72!).",1209340800,83,11092,4.879045092838196

Christopher Lee would own the role of the vampire Dracula during Hammer's run with the franchise. He often complained about the quality of the movies but these films make most of the legacy of Lee's impact in Hammer Horror and his place in film history.
In this set you have the first Dracula film which starred both Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. These two actors will become world famous for their work in Hammer Horror films. It is the best of the collection. Hundreds of articles and books have been written about this film and Lee's impact as the Count. This is easily the best film in this set.
Dracula Has Risen from the Grave and Taste the Blood of Dracula are part of a 3 film set up with in the franchise, these being the last 2 of the trilogy.  Dracula Prince of Darkness is not part of this set was, It is what I consider the first film of this trilogy. They are not up to the impact of Horror
 of Dracula but are well worth watching.
The fourth film is Dracula AD 72. The weakest but it brought Peter Cushing back to the series and Lee and Cushing are great form through out. The prequel in this film is the highlight of the film to watch.

8211876,5,B000U1ZV7G,"Director Terrence Fisher's ""Horror of Dracula"" is, without question, the most exciting vampire movie of them all. Christopher Lee makes a majestic villain, oozing menace and sexual magnetism in equal measure, Peter Cushing is the perfect Professor van Helsing, a scene-stealing variation on his celebrated portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Even Michael Gough (""Batman,"" ""Horrors of the Black Museum"") is included in the cast to add more star power and dramatic punch. The two films that followed it, ""The Brides of Dracula"" (made without Lee and featuring Cushing instead) and ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness""(in which Lee uttered not a word), are watchable. But the series took a step back up with  ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave,"" with Rupert Davies and Veronica Carlson, and ""Taste the Blood of Dracula,""  with comic actor Roy Kinnear (""The Three & Four Musketeers,"" ""Help') and then-newcomer Ralph Bates (""Horror of Frankenstein,"" ""Dr. Jekyll & Sister Hyde,: ""Lust for a Vampire""). Both play even better than they did when originally released. Because the scripts by Anthony Hinds (a.k.a. John Elder) are slightly better than serviceable, the acting, sets, music and deft direction are allowed to shine, making them classics in the Hammer Films tradition. Even ""Dracula A.D. 1972,"" which reunites Lee and Cushing is less jarring in its jump to ""present day."" Plus, there's a fine musical performance by San Francisco's Summer of Love cult band, Stoneground (led by Sal Valentino of the Beau Brummels).",1518048000,2,1501,5.2761506276150625

8211879,5,B000U1ZV7G,"My first introduction to Dracula was Christopher Lee when I was about nine years old. Love how these still hold up even after all these years! They're definitely your standard Hammer Horror flicks - neon red blood, wooden acting, heaving bosoms, complete with gloriously stoic Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing who are both way too good for these movies, but I feel like that just makes them all the more entertaining to watch.

""Horror of Dracula"" is in my opinion the strongest of the four - the atmosphere and tension are all there and the film itself moves very quickly.
""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"" easily comes in second, although in regards to a continuing narrative and continuity, I feel like something is lost here because the curators of this collection neglected to include the film that comes between Horror of Dracula and Dracula has Risen from the Grave (Dracula: Prince of Darkness takes place between the two and I feel cheated not having it included in this set!)
""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" is the most ""scandalous"" (if you can even call it that) and entertaining for all the wrong reasons of the set - with the main characters getting picked off one by one by their own kids who are all under the Count's influence. Easily one of my favorites!
""Dracula A.D. 1972"" was honestly the weakest in my opinion and would have been stronger if we spent less time with the kids and more time with Cushing and Lee and their immortal battle with one another as Van Helsing and Dracula.

All in all, though, this is a really great set if you're looking to introduce someone to the glory that is the Hammer Dracula series.
