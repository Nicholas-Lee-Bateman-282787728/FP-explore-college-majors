8039577,5,B00067075U,This dvd is great for the beginner to intermediate dancer who wants to learn some fun mtv-style choreography. I found it very easy follow and fun to watch! Tim's advice is very encouraging to young dancers who want to break into the business. I definitely reccommend it.,1251504000,,270,4.76595744680851
8039578,5,B00067075U,"This dvd is very thorough. It really motivates the beginning dancer, yet has enough info for those who already study dance. Its easy to learn from and is comprehensive. Starts off with a good stretching series, followed by dance combos to get you moving, and finishes with a funky dance routine. I also liked the interview sections and found them enlightening. Richard is very personable and hits the mark as a very good motivator and instructor.",1134345600,,446,4.881578947368421
8039579,5,B00067075U,"I would definitely recommend this to anyone who, like me, watches music videos just for the dance breaks only to find it goes too quick to learn anything!!! Tim Richard's enthusiasm is contagious & I really had a good ol'time with me & my video on my living room floor. The steps were easy to learn & there was never a dull moment! Also, I found the ""Dancing in Music Videos"" bonus chapter very informative to people looking to break out into the Music Video world. Great gift for teens, the ""MTV generation"" & those who are just looking to have some ""dance"" fun. Definitely a must-have!!!",1132272000,3,589,4.514018691588785
8039580,1,B00067075U,"This DVD is a joke.  I seriously felt like I was watching a skit straight out of ""Saturday Night Live"" or maybe even the ""Wiggles"".  Every facet of this video was outdated...hair...clothes...dance moves...it lacked everything.  For as much as this DVD cost, I couldn't believe how bland the dance setting was.  And geez...the guy teaching the stuff...he maybe had decent rythym, but he had joke written all over him from the get-go. I think he was modeled after Ben Stiller's character in Heavy Weights...an instant giveaway to a bad dance video.  Even if you did follow the dance moves taught in the video, you wouldn't wanna be caught dead doing those moves in a club.  Sorry, but the women dancing to this video looked like...well...they looked like someone you wouldn't catch doing any really smooth moves.  That's probably exactly why there weren't any.  I wanted them to elaborate on some very recent dance moves...simply for the art of watching it...and maybe the possibility of learning something.  But, nothing was accomplished here.  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT waste you money.  Too bad I opened the plastic wrap...yeah, they make the ouside look so urban.  Do not be fooled.",1132012800,4,1183,4.91919191919192
8039581,5,B00067075U,I took a beginning to intermediate level Jazz Tech class with Tim Richard at Saint Mary's College. He is an amazing instructor. He has a lot of personality and enthusiasm that he puts into everything that he does. I loved his class.,1122681600,,232,4.5476190476190474
