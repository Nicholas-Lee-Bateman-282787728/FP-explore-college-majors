8173744,5,6304049889,"I bought this video because I am a huge fan of Daniel Rosen's, and I wasn't disappointed.  Daniel Rosen is hilarious!  Besides teaching you to juggle (excellently), there are lots of great clips of his live show.  I saw some classic bits of his that I remember from The Tonight Show and all the other stuff I've seen him on over the years.  This is a great video for anyone who wants to learn to juggle...or who just wants some big laughs from a great comedian.",1076457600,,461,4.325581395348837
