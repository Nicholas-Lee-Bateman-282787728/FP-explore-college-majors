2170468,1,B00066VTBW,A hastily made rebuttal to F9/11. It's only purpose seems to be allowing those who can't stand the truth a way to sleep without their usual Valium infusion.,1098489600,27,156,4.607142857142857
2170469,4,B00066VTBW,"It provides an excellent retort to some of the reckless propaganda in Moore's movie.  It's intereseting to note that Captain Video provides the only negative review so far.  However, his entire commentary is based on associations that the movie has and not the content of the movie.  I looked at his other reviews.  Pretty predictable stuff: 1 star if it has a conservative slant and 5 stars if it has a liberal slant.  He decries this movie for having a conservative bias yet his review of Moore's film doesn't admit to any liberal bias! What an intellectual fraud.",1098316800,96,566,4.73469387755102

You own it to yourself to see if you believe in the truth or believe in propaganda from a man (Michael Moore) who says ""terrorism is not a problem"" and who says ""I hope more Americans die in Iraq...so Bush will lose the election.""

Proof:

It has won the John Birch Society Award for Excellence in Documentary Filmmaking. That must prove that it is unbiased. <VBG>

The film was financed and produced by Citizens United, a conservative group in Washington.

It was first shown at a conservative film festival.

This is an enlightening review of much of what's said against Bush, by Moore and others, showing what really happened with NO funny editing and presented neutrally.. Judge for yourself, and you'll come out SURPRISED at what you've learned, and be glad you did.
I shows, among other things, full information and proof that  Bush really DID win Florida, in spite of what the democrats like to say. And what the Patriot act really is.  And much more that your liberal friends don't know, and don't want you to know.. They still believe that the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 against the Florida recount..But it was 7 to 9 ..remember?? And were the blacks prevented from getting to the polls?? There is proof here that they weren't .
I saw it at a screening in LA, and the reaction was hugely positive, from people on both sides..It doesn't cause anger, even in partisans.. It enlightens.",1097193600,217,933,4.614457831325301
2170495,5,B00066VTBW,"The only opposition to this movie will be name-calling and blustering from leftists.  but thats what they do anyway so you should be used to it by now.  one important note- this is not an entertainment-based movie.  whereas farenheit 911 was nothing more than a theatrical pile of lies and completely out of context clips, this is a rational, factual breakdown.  here's an example of farenheit's problems.  they show bush on the morning of 911 in a classroom, and show a secret service agent coming in and telling him the nation's under attack, and how he does nothing for like seven minutes.  so what?  you don't know what was said.  in fact, id bet pretty much anything it was something along the lines of ""Mr. President, i need you to remain here and try to appear as if nothing's wrong while we get information.""  seven minutes would seem about right for a conversation between that agent and another of that magnitude.  celsius provides actual fact.  it goes behin the liberal lies and gives you evidence that can not be disputed by anyone in their right mind, no pun intended.  It gives a complete background of different subjects ranging from how it was GORE who tried to steal Florida to Bush's policies, and in-depth look at al-Qaeda, and an overview of John Kerry's history of switching sides on issues when it is politically convenient.  liberals will hate it because it deposes some of the lies they cling to religiously.  this should be required viewing in every classroom in america.  hey, they're cramming our kid's heads with liberal propaganda, why not add in just a touch of conservative fact?",1144022400,18,1611,4.765342960288809
2170496,2,B00066VTBW,"You can tell when someone is at least attempting to offer an honest point of view; in the case of Celsius 41.11, Knoblock distorts the facts and hide some information. To excuse President Bush's inaction after his reception of the Presidential Briefing, you hear, from a talking head, that Dr. Condelezza Rice ""made it clear that the Presidential briefing offered only historical info""; if true, why was most of the document heavily censored and classified ever since?

To explain why certain American citizens despise Bush and link him to Nazism and facism, another talking head explains that, in time of war, fear and paranoia (he really meant ""ignorance"") will result in citizens blaming their leaders... However, which is coming first: the fact that Bush is inciting fear, or a useless war...?",1141257600,14,797,5.083969465648855
2170497,4,B00066VTBW,"This movie makes a good case against the anti-Bush crowd, showing background on the principal reasons for their ""anybody but Bush"" belief system and debunking each charge with comments from several notable commentators-- including Michael Medved, Charles Krauthammer, Fred Barnes, former Sen. Fred Thompson, Victoria Toensing and others.

It also features clips of Sen. John Kerry, Howard Dean, Michael Moore, Sen. Hillary Clinton and others to present the filmakers case.

The film is well done, but I do not recommend it for the shallow among us, not enough flash to keep them interested.  However a thoughful viewer will find plenty of substance here.",1136419200,29,654,5.330097087378641
2170498,1,B00066VTBW,"I had a friend who praised this movie for debunking F/911, which it does fairly well but id have to say that this was the most boring 2 hours a person could live through, they could have put it together a little better then just some Q & A. If anyone were to see this movie wanting to know the truth behind Fahrenheit 9/11, I can asure you that 45 min in to it you simply won't care anymore. I suggest you watch ferhenhype 911 it's a much better movie",1123113600,21,451,4.022222222222222
2170499,4,B00066VTBW,"In an attempt to be balanced, I think anyone who watched the frothing Michael Moore fantasy piece on 9/11 (""Fahrenheit 9/11"") should watch this as well. There is no doubt that ""Celsius 41.11"" was made on a much smaller budget, but it is generally effective nonetheless. The film excels in interview segments with thoughtful conservatives (and some moderates) like Michael Medved and Michael Barone, who provide very good verbal position papers on 9/11 and related subjects, like the Patriot Act and the Florida election problems.

The film does not resort to tricky editing like the Moore piece, but, rather, uses larger excerpts of speakers to give a more accurate picture of reality. There is no doubt that this is less a piece of entertainment than a political ad for Bush (and therefore against John Kerry.)

This material is already somewhat dated now that Bush has been reelected, but if you have seen ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" you should at least give this a quick look in the interest of fairness. If you were entirely taken in by Moore, you will find some disturbing information here, including many incredible quotes from Michael Moore himself.

Normally I would say this is worth three and a half stars, but for attempting to take on the biggest propagandist in Hollywood, I give the movie four.",1121385600,42,1298,4.917808219178082
2170500,1,B00066VTBW,"I decided to rent this movie after having seen Farenheit 9-11 and compare the two. Comparing it to Farenheit 9-11 this movie is amazingly bad. Farenheit brought out things that were done by Congress that this movie just glossed over. Farenheit actually interviewed congress members who admitted that they had not read the act before voting on it. This filn stated that they had all carefully read it in a very quickly glossed over statement. They did not address the Bush-Bin Laden connection or the fact that the Bush administration very quickly got the Bin Laden family out of the country after 9-11.

This movie is just a rehash of the Bush campaign's attack on John Kerry and really not worth the time it takes to watch it. And it's only a little bit over an hour long!!! Doesn't present any documentation of the ""facts"" that it proposes. At least Michael Moore backs up his charges with either documentation or direct interviews with the subjects. Also, much of what is proposed in this film has now been proven false.  Don't waste your money or time with this film.",1119830400,31,1071,4.691489361702128
2170501,2,B00066VTBW,"What was so repugnant to me while watching this film was not the way they shamelessly tried to smear the entire left, but rather the things that went completely unsaid.  For instance, why is it fun and games to show French President Chirac shaking hands with Saddam Hussein when we all know there is also a picture out there of Donald Rumsfeld doing the exact same thing? Why does the 9-11 Commission have authority when it wants to defend Bush, but not enough authority to be taken seriously when it says that there is no connection between Hussein and bin Laden? They also expect us to just take their word for things. You know, the left is lying about the 2000 election, the Patriot Act is good for you, Bush will keep you safe simply because we the filmmakers say so.  And just for good measure, near the end of their film while speaking of World War II claim that America didn't step in to stop the Nazi's because they were isolationists, however the French stayed out because they had their head in the sand. Now can somebody please explain the difference to me?  That said, about 45 minutes into this film I began to realize that I was simply critiquing their political views and not their film.  They can have their propaganda just as those on the left had their propaganda all year round.  Sadly, the fact remains that nowadays those on the right don't know how to be entertaining, just angry.  Trying to make good points is replaced by playing the three cards that get Republicans to the voting booth: 9-11, children, and Hollywood (for the record I don't understand their hatred of Hollywood. If they hated it so much maybe they should stop going to see ""Bad Boys II"" and see something more representative of them, like say ""Undertow"").  ""Team America"" while not a total right-wing film, was at least entertaining.  These filmmakers bored me to tears with their scaremongering and anger.  Also, I have no idea how John O'Neill can remain so angry over the years as he is clearly eating the paychecks the Republicans are cutting him.  The format to this movie was obviously lifted from Robert Greenwald films, only not as good. The only glimmer of hope this film has is the scene in which they cut between lots of Democrats talking bad about Saddam.  However, anybody who has seen ""Outfoxed"" knows that is simply cannot compete with the Bad Apples scene from that film.  In conclusion, no I cannot overcome the half-truths in this movie. That fact would make me a bad film critic if only the rest of this movie weren't so horrible. **1/2",1111795200,15,2547,4.610619469026549
2170502,2,B00066VTBW,"I had high expectations for this production based on the trailer and excerpts I had seen. Unlike FahrenHype 9/11, I expected less talking heads and more of the raw footage showing the reality, while listening to major politicians lie.

There was a little bit. Michael Moore's comment about there being no significant terrorist threat was juxtaposed to footage of the hijacked airliner crash into the tower. Protestors extolling the great things Saddam Hussein has done voiced over vivid footage of Hussein's atrocities.

Unfortunately, like FahrenHype, most of it falls back on well-known commentators such as Fred Barnes, Michael Medved, and Michael Barone. They are all articulate and entertaining speakers, but much of what they say is similar to what they say on their own cable and radio shows.

This DVD is also past its prime. To my surprise, rather than being a refutation of Moore's production, almost half of the DVD is dedicated to taking apart John Kerry. Entertaining? Yes; but no longer relevant (one can only hope). There is a refutation of the generic laundry list of attacks on G.W. Bush (he stole the election, he lied about 9/11, he lied about WMDs, etc.), but that was also timely, and is significantly less relevant after the election.

Technically, there were a few shortcuts. Rather than using real footage or audio from public speeches by John Kerry or Hillary Clinton (or even GW Bush), the audio is over a still image, or the text is rolled in front of a still image with a narrator reading. The real footage is available, so it is unclear why they weren't able to get it. The image quality is excellent, but there is no menu system to the DVD, it plays just like a VCD.

If you want to rehash the election, you might want to rent it. However, if you want to prepare yourself for Fahrenheit 9/11, or just see the other side (aka, get balance), you are better off looking on the web for some excellent expos's and refutations of Moore.",1108944000,18,1960,4.752941176470588
2170503,5,B00066VTBW,"While I admit this film Celsius 41 11 is a pro-Bush film it is more objective and honest than anything Michael Moore has done.  The case is made that preemptive strikes are now an important response to terrorists and dictator thugs.  Former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson really exposes the lies of the radical ""new left"" and the importance of confronting evil in the world.  While I personally wish for the war to be over and for the troops to come home (my brother is a marine in Iraq) expanding freedom is paramount.  It is true that freedom is still expanding around the globe, and is a gift from the Creator not just American values or ideals.  America has a long historical tradition of supporting liberty.

This film also draws a valuable comparison between President Bush and Senator Kerry.  Kerry would fight the war on terrorism in a totally different way that would not put America's interests first.  In conclusion this film makes an extremely successfull case that Bush is conducting the war honorably and ethically.  I would sincerely hope that the Democrats in Congress would join the effort in expanding freedom and democracy across the globe.  Unfortunately, now there is only one party in Washington who champions human rights.

Other highlights of the film include some of the radical statements made by the new left and the inconsistentcy of those who have now changed their tune about the dangers that were present in Iraq.",1107388800,24,1440,4.860655737704918
2170504,1,B00066VTBW,See what the filmakers learned from Adolf Hitler's use of the media as propaganda. They learned from the best. A complete joke. Pure fiction. Dangerous to freedom loving people the world over in the fact that some actually believe this.,1106870400,13,236,4.925
2170525,4,B00066VTBW,"I congratulate those who conceptualized this movie.  They accomplished a noble task which is the discrediting of the anti-American left.  Their title is most inventive as it symbolizes the temperature at which one's brain begins to die.

This is an excellent motif that allows the filmmakers to document just how imbalanced most of the anti-Bush protesters are.  By interviewing and showing this fringe, many of whom I've seen up close and personal in Chicago both in March of 2003 and in March of 2004, the viewer can see the type of anti-reason that they embody.  George W. Bush is as close to Hitler as my keyboard is to organic fertilizer.  To make the comparisons that the Moveon.org crowd make, is to admit to knowing nothing about history and mankind.

Celsius 41 11 is chock full of arguments that you can use to combat the canards of the left.  Florida in 2000 was a scandal but it was a scandal due to the networks calling it early and stealing thousands of votes away from Bush in the Republican panhandle.  The western state vote was supressed before their polls closed, and the film also makes clear that not one African-American was disenfranchised--anywhere.  We find that the Patriot Act is not a means in which to incarcerate librarians, but instead, a way in which to dismantle terrorist organizations with the force of the RICO Act.  Concerning WMDs, every famous secret service in the West (America, France, Germany, Russia, and Great Britian) all regarded Saddam as possessing them in 2003.

You won't find this at Blockbuster and shame on the video conglomerates for being so narrowminded as to prominently display anti-Bush propaganda while completely dodging films like this.",1105747200,20,1699,4.943661971830986
2170526,5,B00066VTBW,"The vicious 2004 Presidential election is evidence of how deeply divided our nation is. The divide goes far deeper than Democrat/Republican or Liberal/Conservative. The divide goes deep into the hearts of all Americans. For over a generation now,our schools have taught that right and wrong is determined by each individual, that you should not let anyone tell you what is right or wrong for you.  This has had a disasterous impact on our national soul.  Because of this we have people like Michael Moore making films with no concern for truth or accuracy. In Mr. Moore's eyes, the truth is not important. He truly hates America and he hates George Bush because Pres. Bush has the audacity to love our nation and to believe that all people on Earth should have a chance to be free. Celsius 411 and FahrenHYPE 9/11 were made as an answer to Mr. Moore, and to put forth the real story, if anyone really cares to seek out the truth.  In the Bible, when life was good for God's chosen people, they valued their possessions more than God and turned away from Him. The Bible says then ""every man did what was right in his own eyes"".  Which is to say they determined their own morality instead of following God's law.  This resulted in God's punishment and great sorrow, which would then bring them back to the Lord, which then led to His blessings and then the cycle started again. Half of Americans still believe and look to God for guidence. In the other half, every man is doing what is right in his own eyes. This my fellow citizens is the root of our divide. As the numbers in the first group dwindle, the fabric of our society is futher torn.  How long until......",1103673600,21,1664,4.53
2170527,1,B00066VTBW,God his movie stinks.  O.K. Fahrenheit 9/11 was a little one sided but but GOD they pump this thing with more lies here that they do in Fahrenheit 9/11.  By the way this movie is RATED R for brief language and violent images,1101859200,30,224,4.186046511627907
2170528,2,B00066VTBW,"Before buying this movie, you should be aware that it is more of a campaign film bashing Kerry (who is called a liar more than once). In fact the film is put out by a group called Citizens United, a self declared advocacy group for the ""Bush Agenda"" (check out [...]) and the feature song by Larry Gatlin, ""Johnboy"" is a mockery of Kerry's flip-flopping.  I was hoping for a lucid answer to Moore's Farenheit 9-11, but in fact only the first half of the film tries to rebut Moore's work, and even then it does so in very broad strokes.  It only addresses about half the issues in Moore's film and does not specifically attack F-9/11, but provides a general conservative view of the topics.  I think the film merits two stars because its segment on the 2000 election (significantly longer than Moore's) is an intelligent rebuttal to what I consider the weakest part of Farenheit 9-11.  Other than that, basically the film just gathers a handful of right-wing cheerleaders (Krauthammer, Barone, Medved, et. al) who parrot the lines you've been hearing all election cycle. By the way, I found myself wondering why Michael Medved, a TV/Movie critic, is presented as an expert voice on foreign policy. It also felt ironic to hear Medved, who criticizes media violence so strongly (and correctly, I believe) speak so glowingly about violence as a solution in the real world.  Anyway, if you're not familiar with the conservative take on election issues, this movie is worth a look.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.",1101772800,44,1511,4.792307692307692

Low/No budget movie (if you go to their website it says in large letters that they need the money from the DVD sales in order to keep this showing in theaters...in what theaters though? Check your local listings for this movie and you probably won't recognize any of them). There is also a reason why Michael Moore received one of the most sought after movie awards next to ""The Oscar"", ""The Palme d'Or"" in Cannes, France, and this movie did/would not.

I think this movie was a very poor attempt in getting some of the Bush supporters that temporarly lost faith in ""the man who stole the election in 2000"", to make sure they will vote Bush. Unfortunetly the irrelevance of this movie in some parts and just the fact that this movie is probably just as good as Marriah Carey's ""Glitter"" movie just makes this boring to watch and just plain old silly.",1099094400,14,998,4.423913043478261

For anyone who needs a little refresher course in history, including how 9/11 really came about, and how the ongoing terrorist threat is really a threat to the Western way of life, this is a great place to start.

Of course this movie got no attention from the ""unbiased"" elite media that lavished millions of dollars of free publicity on the mendacious movie by Moore, so it will never make as big a splash as it should. The only people who can find fault with this movie are the ones who are so full of hatred for Bush that their brains reject any reasonable alternative to their very naive view of the world.",1099008000,119,797,4.4520547945205475
2170534,1,B00066VTBW,"I watched both films.  I thought they were both hogwash.

Michael Moores Film , Farenheit 911, lost me in the begining with all of the anti-Arab racism.  It gradually because better.  I did not like all of the biased Bush bashing.

  Celsius 41.1 lost me when it failed to recognize that the Bush administration lied about every reason that was given for going to war. Celsius 41.1 failed to recognize that the CIA and Bush's own weapons inspectors told the president that there was no evidence that Iraq had anything to do with 911 and Iraq did not have Weapons of Mass Destruction.  The pentagon was furious with CIA director Tenet because he refused to support the neoconservative lies and their plans for war that had been ongoing for the last 10 yrs. They wrote about their plans in books, and prominent think tanks..like the Project For A New American Century(PNAC) even before Bush was even elected.  Many member of PNAC now have key post in the adminstration of George Bush.

If this war was not about weapons of Mass Destruction...then what is this war really about? Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear & the Selling of American Empire examines how a radical fringe of the Republican Party used the trauma of the 9/11 terror attacks to advance a pre-existing agenda to radically transform American foreign policy while rolling back civil liberties and social programs at home. The documentary places the Bush administration's false justifications for war in Iraq within the larger context of a two-decade struggle by neoconservatives to dramatically increase military spending in the wake of the cold war, and to expand American power globally by means of military force. At the same time, the documentary argues that the Bush administration has sold this radical and controversial plan for aggressive American military intervention by deliberately manipulating intelligence, political imagery, and the fears of the American people after 9/11.

Narrated by Julian Bond, Hijacking Catastrophe features interviews with more than twenty prominent political observers, including Pentagon whistleblower Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski, who witnessed first-hand how the Bush administration set up a sophisticated propaganda operation to link the anxieties generated by 9/11 to a pre-existing foreign policy agenda that included a preemptive war on Iraq.

At its core, the film places the deceptions of the Bush administration within the larger frame of questions seldom posed in the mainstream: What, exactly, is the agenda that drove the administration's pre-war deceptions? How is 9/11 being used to sell this agenda? And what are the stakes for America, Americans, and the world if this agenda succeeds in being fully implemented during a second Bush term?

That is the question that was answered in Media Education Foundation's Hijacking Catastrophe.

The very best film about the Iraq war and the reasons have been produced by the Media Education Foundation, ***(Hijacking Catastrophe: 911, Fear and the Selling of American Empire), and by Robert Greenwald (Uncovered: The Real Reasons for the War on Iraq).

8039396,1,B00066VTBW,"Celsius 41.11 is a political documentary made by Citizens United that would serve as a rebuttal and response to the highest grossing political documentary of all-time,Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. The known conservative political organization that produced it tries to bring up 5 of the many charges against the former President George W.Bush that were presented in Moore's extremely popular documentary. In addition to that,it also brings up charges against John Kerry,the Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the 2004 U.S. General Elections against Bush as it was released during that particular year. The title was inspired about the temperature that the brain was suppose to die in Celsius according to the film's tagline.

The film dealt with defense the five charges that was brought against incumbent President George W.Bush in Moore film are the following:Bush stole Florida during the 2000 General Elections,Bush didn't do enough to stop 9/11; Bush is stealing our civil liberties; Bush lied about WMDs; Bush Doctrine inflames Islamists. In addition to that,the military record of John Kerry was brought up particularly when he served during the Vietnam War. It brought neoconservatives such as Michael Ledeen, Fred Barnes, Charles Krauthammer and Michael Medved to discuss these issues. Interestingly,Terror expert Mansour Ijaz also discussed about the 9/11 incident. Too bad that watching this documentary today only proved how weak this documentary was as a whole and it would definitely look laughable and ridiculous as a counter-argument against Fahrenheit 9/11 despite bringing only five issues against it.

Let's discuss the defense they brought in favor of the incumbent President briefly.

First,it brought up that Bush won Florida in 2000 overwhelmingly and that the networks called the results early. But it never brought the fact that there were a lot of incidents of faulty counting machines used in areas that are known to be Democrats and how minority voters primarily African-Americans were intimidated and harassed from voting. This was reported in the media numerous times.

Second,it brought up that former President Bill Clinton did not do enough to prevent terrorism during his 8-year term as President and presents many attacks that happened in the 90's. It also brings up Clinton's failure to capture Osama Bin Laden. Too bad that even Bush was unable to capture Bin Laden as well during his term and seems to forget that 9/11 happened during Bush's term and not during that of Clinton's.

Then,it brings the issue of Bush is not stealing our civil liberties with the implementation of the Patriot Act during his term. The conservatives have full support for it. But looking back,many politicians - Democrats and most especially Republicans - have called for it revisions or better yet removal. Dinesh D'Souza's latest pro-right documentary,America:Imagine A World Without Her now even blames the Democrats for its implementation and that they use it against President Obama critics. Funny!!!!!!!!!!!

Also,it brings up that Bush never lied about the existence of WMD's in Iraq by showing old videos of Saddam's stockpile and that he fooled U.N. inspectors. But Americans already know the truth after the definitive report made by CIA weapons investigator Charles A. Duelfer, which stated that IRAQ HAD NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!!!!Again,we all know who is lying. LOL

Finally,it tries to convince us that the Bush doctrine infuriates Islamic countries. Now,many Americans believe the war effort in the places like the Middle East is more or less useless just like the Iraq War and only benefits rich people with business interest in it rather than the whole country as a whole.

As for Kerry's military record in Vietnam as well as his activism towards the war,another documentary entitled Going Upriver counters these charges. The said documentary proves that Kerry's experience in Vietnam made him realize that the U.S. war effort over there is a waste after seeing many of his comrades suffer and dies continuously.

After pointing out what is wrong with information this documentary provides,another thing that would definitely bother the viewer is its blandness,lack of entertainment and lack of sense of humor. One would probably feel bored watching it. Overall,it only serves as a political ad for President George W.Bush and nothing more. No wonder it's title is Celsius 41.11 - the temperature the brain begins to die- considering that one's brain will definitely reach it while viewing this documentary. That is why avoid it at all cost!!!!!! LOL",1423872000,,4606,5.3246217331499315

8039400,1,B00066VTBW,"I actually wrote an entire piece as I was watching it, and what you get is nothing but clever deviations and lies. It's basically Bush cronies in the press, journalism and political spectrums, trying to re-sell you everything that the GOP has been trying to sell you for the last 30 years. It distorts every topic it talks about, and gives a very bias point of view. While it does point out some very minute inaccuracies about Fahrenheit 9/11, and properly answers upon some of the edits Moore purposely cut out and left only half stated, it still only serves to glorify Bush and his Iraq war with even more incredible inaccuracies, solid fabrications, and outright untruths. It actually doesn't really do much of pointing out inaccuracies of Fahrenheit 9/11, in comparison. It paints Muslims as a whole out to be the enemy, and attempts to reinforce the notion that they all hate us, and they're trying to kill us. More specifically, everything Joshua Muravchik says is blatant lying. He's not like some of the other interviewees on this film who just kind of spew some spin on specific topics based on pure bias and not all of the facts, he entirely bends the truth 180 degrees, and presents it as fact.

Keep in mind, I'm not a Michael Moore fan. I watch a variety of documentaries and such films based on the American political spectrum, and he does happen to make them occasionally, as does Citizens United, though this happened to be the first film I've seen by them, as I tend to stray more into other unknowns. This film doesn't state much that you hadn't already heard from 2000-2008, but it just re-instills it into your head, like beating a dead horse. If you're looking for an anti-Michael Moore documentary, or a documentary that debunks Michael's points, keep moving. This virtually does neither one of them. For people who actually read, and know what's really going on in the world, this movie will only make you angry at the astounding lies brought up in it. It serves no real purpose other than a laugh, or enraging anger.",1257379200,5,2040,4.6824512534818945

This movie is more of right wing propaganda from Bush supporters of his disastrous foreign policies.",1211932800,,393,4.397260273972603
8039403,1,B00066VTBW,"You know when the director is listed as ""Citizens United"" that there is ome sort of bias inherit in the film.  This is one of the most blatant pieces of right-wing propaganda I've had the displeasure of sitting through.  If the purpose is to present a critical, unbiased analysis of Michael Moore's film, then they have failed miserably.  It is perfectly legitimate to question some of the fact's on Moore's documentaries.  He does present many facts that are questionable.  But, this documentary presents Bush as a saint-like figure, and the liberal ""nutzo's"" as deceitful, un-Americans scumbags.  If you are interested in any sort of intelligent debate, look elsewhere.  This is strickly for the Fox News crowd.",1194566400,12,713,5.094827586206897
8039404,2,B00066VTBW,"Upon hearing about this film, I expected it to be a point-by-point rebuttal of Moore's F 9-11, but it's not.  In fact, I really don't know what their point was.  They quote Democrats out of context and have a series of speech blurbs that don't really mean anything.  The end of the film is basically a long session of Kerry bashing, which has little intellectual meaning - it doesn't shed light on the F 9-11 issue.  The film makes Bush appear nearly saint-like, and is right wing propaganda at its best.  However, I suggest watching F 9-11 first, then 41.11, and form your own opinion.",1194307200,9,586,4.542857142857143
