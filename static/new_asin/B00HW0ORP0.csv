6230001,5,B00HW0ORP0,"Elegant country estates and picturesque cottages hide dastardly activities in Englands Midsomer County, where corpses seem to stack like kindling, murders are often remarkably grotesque, and motives range from bizarre to out-and-out kinky. Based on novels and characters created by Caroline Graham and debuting in 1997, the long-running BBC series MIDSOMER MURDERS features Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles), his slightly daffy wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), and their theatrically ambitious daughter Cully (Laura Howard.) Tom is assisted in his cases by the workman-like P.C. Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) and a number of medical men, most often the dryly comic Dr. Bullard (Barry Johnson.) The repeating characters are often supported by luminaires from the British stage, screen, and television, and the scripts are memorable for their dark witbut in spite of the humor, episodes often include a strange sense of tragedy. Although the central characters sometimes have overarching storylines, each episode stands alone, a complete story told in about an hour and forty minutes.

Set Nine contains eight titles.  The first is House in the Woods, in which Barnabys previous assistant D.S. Dan Scott (John Hopkins) has called in sick.  Barnaby makes a quick substation with P.C. Constable Ben Jones (Jason Hughes), and Scott disappears from the series.  In this episode, a young married couple looking for an old house to restore stumble across the perfect propertyand into their own deaths.  In Vixens Run, a larger-than-life aristocrats sudden death touches off a series of murders that seem to involve his first, second, and current wives.  Down Among the Dead Men mixes murder with blackmail, and sends Barnaby off to seaside to pursue the investigation.  Four Funerals and a Wedding is a convoluted story of decades old mistaken identification that results in murder, set against the background of a village ritual that pits women against men.

Country Matters is a wickedly funny episode that tangles high class and slightly kinky prostitution, a questionable land transaction, and the appearance of a stabbed corpse in a condemned lumber mill.  Death in Chorus finds Barnabys wife Joyce participating in a choral contest where the competition appears to be deadly; Joyce and daughter Cully are frequently involved in Barnabys investigations, and this story gives actress Jane Wymark a bit of a showcase.  Last Years Model is unique among series episodes: when an accused woman comes to trial, Barnaby suddenly has second thoughts about her guilt.  The trial plays out against flashbacks of the original investigation and present-time scenes of Barnabys new investigation, and the result is an entertaining mixture of Hitchcock and Christie.

In addition to memorable performances, great scripts, and first rate production values, MIDSOMER MURDERS also has an intriguing score and makes effective, often paranoia-inducing, use of prowling cameras that sometimes take the killers point of view. And it is the rare episode that stops at one or murders. Three is commonplace, four is not exactly unknow, and fans of the cozy genre may well find the series a bit too disturbing for their tastes. But if you like a good murder mystery, youll find it in this series. Its immediately addictive. Strongly recommended.

6230014,5,B00HW0ORP0,"Another great set of mysteries featuring detective Tom Barnaby (John Nettles).  His new sidekick is a local PC (Jason Hughes as Ben Jones), a sort of a Johnny-on-the-spot.  He is quite eager to be helpful.  Together they solve several puzzling murders, bodies strewn about, people dispatched in a variety of ways.  They deal with lying realtors, blackmailers, and vengeful souls bent on ruining someones day.  They stick with their winning formula up until the last mystery: Last Years Model.  At this point they break with tradition and toss in the boring mechanics of a trial (a woman who may or may not be guilty of murder).  I don't watch these mysteries for the trial aspect, one presumes theyll end up there eventually, Id rather watch them solving cases.",1460073600,2,761,4.8984375

6230034,5,B00HW0ORP0,"Iam writing one review for all the Midsomer Murders Series.  They are our favorite shows
of all time.  In my opinion no one comes close to British mysteries. John Nettles is the best
In his role as Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and Sgt. Troy as his enthusiatic partner.
Will certainly miss them in future series.",1422489600,2,316,4.7272727272727275

6230045,5,B00HW0ORP0,"An already delightful show gets even better! This season shows a sudden deepening of the seriousness behind some of the crimes. One episode featuring someone kept on chemical restraint, is the most disturbing of the series up to this point. Another episode is told in retrospect and examines the trial aspect of the crimes in a way, previously unseen in the series. There is a gravity introduced in Season 9 that truly makes it the best yet, of an already superb show.",1409875200,7,468,4.719512195121951

8636574,1,B00HW0ORP0,"I only watched this for about 15 minutes before turning it off.  Today most people don't consider using the words Jesus, Jesus Christ, or Christ to be offensive in a film, but I do.  In fact I find it more offensive than other expletives.  It rubs such a raw nerve that I refuse to watch beyond it, especially when the the first 15 minutes repeats the offense several times.  I was unfamiliar with the series but because I'm such a huge fan of British programs and movies I almost bought the whole boxed series.  Fortunately I gave it a trial run with just series 9.  Too bad.  British actors are so good and the storylines generally so well thought out, I had hoped for they were above this.",1519171200,,692,4.359375
