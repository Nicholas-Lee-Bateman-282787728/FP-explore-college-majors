Now I know why; this has to be a joke;you see a hand lighting up a fire in a fireplace then the fire takes forever to get going
and all of a sudden, after a brief moment of seeing  a full blown fire, the fire dies down in a matter of minutes!?!
Then on again, off again;
when it nears it's premature end, ( a fireplace fire lasts more than a few minutes) the people who made that joke (film) let you stare
(in disbelief) at a dying fire even longer than the short fire lasted, making for a very long and agonizing
film of ...nothing; as if this wasn't bad enough, the music is awful; I really don't understand why a reviewer wrote that it put her
in a festive mood; it's like badly played jazz, so bad you have trouble figuring out what song it is;
If it sells for more than a penny, don't bother because you are very likely to hate it and regret paying $15 more or less.",1479081600,,948,3.9894736842105263
8006205,3,B00013WWQQ,"I agree with both of the other current reviews.  It is a nice DVD, with nice music (or crackling fire noise) and a nice picture, but only when the fire is fully lit.  The rest of the time the screen is either 1/2 black or 3/4 of the way black, which I find very odd.  This changes frenquently, but stays black or bright for quite a while before it changes. When the fire is fully lit, it's very pretty.  When it's not fully lit, you have a very dark screen with only a little fire light.  Probably best used if you are moving about the house doing other things, versus sitting in front of the TV watching the ""fire"".  I do think it's a nice DVD, just be prepared on what to expect picture wise.  The music is a variety of classical, jazzy, and modern Christmas songs.  Something for everyone.",1322006400,,792,4.233333333333333
8006206,5,B00013WWQQ,"When the Holidays can seem so hectic, I really like this DVD because it helps me unwind and put me in a nice, relaxed Christmas Mood. And you just can't beat the great price! Highly recommend!",1165449600,,192,4.361111111111111
8006207,1,B00013WWQQ,"In most places on this DVD the fireplace scenes are dark and not well filmed at all.

If you are expecting a fireplace decorated for Christmas (as I was) or a bright festive fireplace, then you are going to be very disappointed with this DVD.

Don't waste your money on this turkey.",1100217600,6,282,4.403846153846154
