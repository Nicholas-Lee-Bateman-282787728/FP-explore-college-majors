5658804,5,B00BNH9NCU,"The Numbers Station was just a breath of suspenseful fresh air to me. Everything about the movie was first rate. Everything matters. I was caught up in their universe for the whole movie and not one thing took me out of that universe. Seriously, all 10 of us here absolutely love the movie - and that is the first time THAT has ever happened.

The acting as exacting, professional, and spot-on. The script (at least what was in the movie) was a remarkably tight and completely relevant. John Cusack was flawless. The directing was surreal. Even the friggin' lighting was perfect through the entire movie. Everything came together in an indescribable and unexpected perfection that I had given up thinking could ever exist. And I didn't expect squat from this movie! I just wanted to see John Cusack because I'm a fan. Frankly, I don't think any other actor could have pulled off this role like John did. Nobody.

Having a movie this entertaining while also delivering whatever metaphor you need for now (rare quality) has not been done this well in a movie... ever. If you can imagine the quality of story and writing of the classics that are becoming movies now (finally) in the form of something also very entertaining in a genre like this. Wow. Just... wow. I can't wait to buy this movie when it comes out to be bought.",1367625600,27,1323,4.64957264957265
5658805,4,B00BNH9NCU,It was very good and I would recommend it to anyone who has the interest in espionage related film! Very good!,1367625600,9,110,4.285714285714286
5658806,4,B00BNH9NCU,"""The Numbers Station"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Emerson (played by John Cusack), a CIA operative in the field. As the movie opens, we see Emerson involved in an assassination of several targets but it all goes horribly wrong when the daughter of one of the targets comes onto the scene. Unable to ""retire"" her, Emerson's boss Gray (played by Liam Cunningham) does so instead, but he promptly demotes Emerson away from the field. Next we see that Emerson has been assigned to guard the broadcaster, a woman named Katherine (played by Malin kerman), of a ""numbers station"" in the country side near Suffolk, England. As the movie explains, a numbers station broadcasts (in short wave) secret messages in numbers to agents in the field, giving them new assignments. Not long after, the numbers station is attacked and infiltrated, and all kinds of trouble and mayham ensues. Why is the numbers station being attacked? Will Emerson and Katherine make it out alive? Is there double-play at hand anywhere? To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, John Cusack! Yes, Cusack is front and center in this movie, he is in fact in every scene and in virually every shot. Aging gracefully, yet maintaining that boyish face, Cusack carries the movie from start to finish, and for me he is reason enough to watch and enjoy this movie. But wait! there is more! Malin kerman as the person Cusack needs to protect is equally delightful, oozing charm (and, let's be honest, looks as well). She is playing the role of Debbie Harry in the upcoming movie ""CBGB"" later this year, can't wait for that. When I saw the end credits role of this movie, I couldn't help but notice it had tons of international co-production assists (including VFX from Belgium, where I grew up).

Imagine my surprise when ""The Numbers Station"" showed up this weekend out of nowhere and without any pre-release buzz or ads on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. So I decided to go see it right away, as I figure this won't stick around long. As it turned out, I got a private screening of it. Yes indeed, I was the only person in the theatre! Weird. That aside, ""The Numbers Station"" is a pleasant thriller that is worth it mostly for the solid performances of John Cusack and Malin kerman.",1366934400,44,2412,4.713270142180095
5658807,3,B00BNH9NCU,"The Numbers Station (2013) - John Cusack (Say Anything, Better Off Dead, Grosse Point Blank), Malin Akerman (Children's Hospital), Liam Cunningham (Safe House, Game of Thrones)

Premise: Emerson Kent (Cusack), a former hitman, is assigned to guard a broadcaster (Akerman) in a Numbers Station - a broadcast station that transmits targets to assassins in the field. When their location is compromised, Kent is ordered to execute the broadcaster and kill anyone who enters the station - until he realize that he's caught up in a conspiracy he never could have anticipated.

Thoughts: This is a direct to DVD film. Solid writing, decent acting - but this is not a mind-blowing film. It's an entertaining, self-contained thriller which is mainly located in the broadcast station. It's a passable thriller - but your mileage may vary at times depending on your feelings towards the leads. Cusack doesn't strike me as the action thriller type - belonging more to the dramatic-comedy genre which defined his early career. He essentially plays a dramatic version of his Martin Blank-character from Grosse Point Blank.

Should you buy this: I'd recommend it for a rental.

EDIT: This film is apparently not a direct-to-DVD film - due to Apple TV it was available on VOD in early April, which lead me to the false assumption that it was not released theatrically when it has been brought to my attention that it has received a limited release in the US. So it's a cut above what you'd get for Direct To DVD, but still only a decent movie.",1366848000,5,1528,4.888030888030888
5658808,3,B00BNH9NCU,"Emerson (John Cusack) is a government assassin who grew a conscience and failed to kill an innocent witness. He is given a desk job at a secure bunker in England. He will work with a woman (Malin Akerman) and together they transmit codes to agents operating in Europe performing all kind of black ops...or something. When the station is compromised, Emerson has orders to ""retire the broadcaster.""

Most of the action takes place within the Numbers Station with the two main actors. The strength of this light spy action thriller rests on their performances as they fight for survival.

Cusack was more convincing in this film than he was ""The Factory."" The movie holds your interest as you wonder what Emerson will ultimately do, why the station was compromised and by who. It is a film you will find ""okay"" and then forget about it as it blends into everything else you have seen.

Parental guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1366416000,41,925,4.732919254658385

5658862,2,B00BNH9NCU,"As some one that has been into radio all my life since 3 anyway, I was delighted to see a movie about the numbers Stations.  We use to listen to them in the 60's and speculate as to who and what they were.  The woman chosen for the operator was just about the way I had envisioned. No one knew anything about the stations and every country denied knowing anything about them, yet there they were.

I could not wait to s what someone imagination could come up with.  There is and was SO much potential, and I had not heard of this movie.  THEY BLEW IT.  The movie has no imagination, I fell asleep in part.  There could have been so much more out of this top secrete that was well know to exist but no real info on them for over 50 yrs. and the BEST they Could come up with was this movie.  I am Sooooo glad I did not pay the exorbitant price of a movie these days to see it.  It is really not worth the $7 I paid to buy it.  I don't remember it in the theaters maybe they knew it was a bomb albeit well made.  John Cusack probably needed vacation money to take suck a week story.

  If you believe that the CIA would be transmitting directives to agents via short wave radio in the form of number sequences read by young women (why?) who (spoiler alert as if it matters) must be guarded by full time bodyguards and deliver the numbers reading from a multimillion dollar underground complex (why?) and must be killed if compromised! then this is the film for you.

In addition, the whole cast consists of probably twenty people, most of the action consists of about ten people, who spend a lot of their time talking and the denouement makes no sense.",1410048000,,862,4.484076433121019

When Emerson (Cusack) runs afoul of his boss Grey (Cunningham) during an important assignment, he is sent to work with Katherine as a protector at a remote, secret 'numbers station' which is eventually endangered. This sets Emerson and Katherine on the dangerous path of preventing the key essentials from falling into enemy hands. But who is protecting whom, what is at risk, and at what cost?

5658884,2,B00BNH9NCU,The story centers around a burned-out CIA black ops agent assigned to protect a code operator at a secret broadcasting location. He's tired of being ordered to kill people that are innocent bystanders. Then he's ordered to do so again in its next assignment - boring from start to finish.,1404950400,,288,4.78
5658885,4,B00BNH9NCU,"A burnt-out black ops agent is sent to a top secret numbers station in Suffolk where messages for secret assignments are sent to other black ops. When he and the operator discover the night shift team dead and the station in shambles, he's ordered to close down the station and kill the operator. While he hesitates, the invading team again attacks the station again. In the following showdown, he discovers new messages were sent out, ordering the assassination of the top 15 men in the CIA. Now he has several choices to make...kill the agent and get himself out alive, try to cancel the orders, defend the station, or just blow everything to Hell.

A tense film, starting with a particularly brutal scene in which three innocent bystanders are murdered for witnessing the assassination of a former black ops agent. One is tracked to his home and killed along with his teenaged daughter. This sets quite plainly the reason for the agent's transfer to the relative peace and monotony of the numbers station. The rest of the story is mostly action and will he/won't he? as he mentally fights against following the orders to kill the woman he's supposed to be guarding.

There's not much time given to building up a rapport between the two characters but it does seem to be there, if reluctantly on his part. LIttle background is given to make the viewer hold much sympathy for the character, other than his refusal the kill the teenager as she runs after him begging to know why he shot her father, only to be gunned down by his handler. A few off-handed remarks here and there between him and the station operator are the only other clues to his character and hers. The rest is their having to rely on each other while they fight to get out of the station.

Probably if one were to analyze the script,  there are a million holes in this story but sitting back and just enjoying it without critiquing is the best way to go...I found it a tight drama with enough doubt as to the operator's fate to make it tense.",1404345600,,2011,4.562326869806094

What makes it a little more interesting is the thread of plausibility with which it opens.
Various nations engaged in on-the-ground espionage need a means of communicating with their
operatives.  Besides the old-fashion ways of drop-boxes, there's a more high-tech way:
broadcasting encrypted signals.  A brief message is sent out, whenever there are new instructions.
Both the sender and the receiver have a book of one-use-only decoding instructions.  Sender
encrypts and transmits; receiver receives and decodes, and then destroys both the decoded msg.
and the page used to decode it.  Since each key is one-use-only, it is extremely difficult or
impossible to crack (unless of course you can get your hands on the source code before it is
destroyed).  Cusack plays a CIA agent who had a bit of a failure in his last field assignment.  So as
""punishment"" he is sent to a remote transmission station in England, as the night-shift agent
assigned to guard the transmitter (a civilian working on a contract basis).  Naturally of course, it
turns out to be anything but a boring backwater assignment.  Shortly after he arrives all hell breaks
loose.  The day shift staff have been murdered.  Someone wants into the (naturally secret) station
and access to the latest code, for their own purposes.

The acting is decent.  Initially Cusack despises his assignment and has little respect for the contractor;
nor does she particularly like him.  But when they find themselves alone and under attack, that's when
we find out whether they can handle it and where their loyalties lie.  It's a rather claustrophobic thriller
since it seemed 90% of it took place at night and underground in this station.  It was fairly violent but
there is no sex, no nudity, no focus on gore, and no more swearing than one would expect in that kind
of situation.  I liked it.",1391558400,,1947,4.962962962962963

Will he regain his unconsciousness or is he doomed forever to make feeling decisions that will make him even useless at the station?

Looks like the station has been compromised. It could be an enemy from within. Will Emerson come to his senses? It looks that there may be more at stake than first assumed.

Wow, this movie was quite terrible.  I'm generally a John Cusack fan, and I really enjoy spy thrillers, but this movie is a particularly poor example of the genre.  To begin with, the premise is stupid (these ""numbers stations"" are purely analog, so supposedly they can't be hacked, but the data to broadcast is apparently transmitted by computer...).  A bad guy wants to send his own codes through the number station so he goes to a lot of trouble to terrorize the female operator into broadcasting his message but later in the movie someone else (not a trained operator) is easily able to broadcast codes over the system... In which case, why all the torture?  Most annoying, the operators are supposedly trained cryptographers, but in fact all they do is read numbers over the air.  They have no idea what the numbers mean.  Then when the bad guy substitutes his own codes, the operator-heroine is suddenly able to decipher them.

At the end, we're supposed to believe that the CIA would want to kill its own cryptographer because she ""knows too much"" even though she's saved a dozen people's lives, put her own in jeopardy, and...wait.  She's a CRYPTOGRAPHER (supposedly)!  Are you really going to kill your cryptographer employee because she did the work you presumably hired her to do?

5658940,2,B00BNH9NCU,"The Numbers Station (Kasper Barfoed, 2013)

This could easily be a four-word review. (For those of you reading it at Popcorn: the subtitle was the initial review.) But, you know, Amazon requires at least twenty words, so I figure I might as well throw in a plot synopsis and at least one gratuitous reference to a couple of other thrillers this put me in mind of all too many times.

Emerson Kent (Fat Man and Little Boy's John Cusack) is a wet work guy for the American government. (For those of you not up on your spy thrillers or conspiracy theory: that means he kills people on governmental orders.) His boss, Grey (Safe House's Liam Cunningham), goes out with him on the mission that opens the movie (we find out the identity of the subject later; it is germane to what I assume was supposed to be Emerson Kent's growth trajectory during the film, though that misfired pretty much constantly). It goes haywire when an innocent bystander enters the picture, resulting in a short, but ugly, trail of bodies. Kent begins to have doubts about his work, so the Agency gives him the equivalent of a desk job: babysitting the broadcaster at a numbers station, Katherine (Watchmen's Malin Akerman). Not long into the assignment, the two of them are driving to the station when they're ambushed. After they've gotten inside and Kent calls for evacuation, he's told to kill Katherine, as she's been compromised. This, of course, puts him in exactly the same situation he was in before, except this time, the folks who were shooting at them are just on the other side of the door, and they've got power tools.

On the one hand, I realize I'm coming down extra-hard on this movie because someone finally got around to making a movie about numbers stations and it turns out to be as mediocre as, well, The Numbers Station. I was expecting way more from this movie than most people probably were, and I didn't get it. And then there's John Cusack playing a contract killer. Yeah, I didn't like Grosse Pointe Blank, either. I try not to typecast people, honest I do, but Lloyd Dobler is walking around with a gun in his hand. What would Peter Gabriel think of this?

On the other hand, there is a lot of Charisma in this movie. Not the trait, the excellent Kiyoshi Kurosawa film from 1998 that plays with identities in crisis in exactly the same way this movie tries (and fails) to. If F. Scott Frazier, turning in his first screenplay, had paid a little more attention to Kurosawa, he might have gotten this way more right than he did. It's as if he took the seeds of Charisma and crossed them with any number of other mediocre thrillers, though the one I'm most put in mind of--probably because I saw it mere weeks ago--is the Wesley Snipes vehicle Game of Death. The Numbers Station and Game of Death share a seeming desire to cater to the lowest common denominator, and that pretty much spells their doom at ever rising above the tired pack. Still, it's another one of those ""if you have nothing to do on Saturday night"" movies. That said, if you have nothing better to do on Saturday night, do yourself a huge favor and rent Charisma instead. **",1375833600,,3140,4.571936056838366

This organization is a completely self contained branch of what...non-government? that uses civilians to broadcast secretly coded instructions to agents worldwide in order to effect world changing missions of death and destruction;  another group made up of rogue agents is determined to wipe out the existing heads of the organization.

John Cusak plays the part of an agent who has reached a moral crisis after killing another agent who tried to escape the organization. He is then faced with killing not only a witness to the deed, but the witness's teenaged daughter. He discovers that he is incapable of taking her innocent life, which leaves the task to his partner. Consequently, he is suspended from his position and assigned to be 'handler' of one of the civilian code broadcasters, a lighthearted young woman who is always trying to get Cusak to 'lighten up'.

Her life becomes forfeit when the station from where she broadcasts is compromised by the group of rogue agents. Unfortunately, because she knows so much, the organization also wants her silenced. Cusak finds his moral compass is too strong to let that happen and the movie takes off.

I always like to watch a movie that shows, no matter how far gone a person may be morally, we all can choose to change our life's direction. This is one of those movies where the good guy does not necessarily finish last.",1373500800,,1835,4.925566343042071

5658959,3,B00BNH9NCU,"Though governments do not officially admit, it is widely believed that radio broadcasts are used for espionage purposes. These shortwave radio stations are called numbers station, which is also the title of this OK thriller.

In ""The Numbers Station"" John Cusack is Emerson Kent, a government operative whose latest mission went terribly wrong. Discredited, Emerson is sent to an underground numbers station in a rural British area, where he works with a young code operator Katherine (Malin Akerman). When the station is compromised, however, Emerson is faced with a difficult moral choice, while trying to survive.

It seems Danish director Kasper Barfoed does not know what kind of film he is trying to make. If it is a thriller, ""The Numbers Station"" is simply boring with not much mystery to solve; if it is a character study, two main characters Emerson and Katherine are just flat. Also, the storyline is predictable, and as to the intriguing idea of numbers station, it is eventually forgotten as the story goes on.

The low-budget thriller starts with one interesting idea, which the filmmakers failed to develop. With John Cusack ""The Numbers Station"" is watchable throughout, but after all, what we really don't know is, if Emerson fails, so what?",1372636800,,1258,5.097087378640777

By that I mean there was just a sense of drama and the advertised ""action"" was minimal.

When I ordered this from Amazon, I paid the higher cost for the Blue Ray version, which wasn't necessary because the better definition of Blue Ray wasn't needed for this dark underground silo setting. I was mostly entertained and it mostly kept my interest, but I doubt I will watch it again. If you want to see it, I recommend a Redbox rental for $1 or buying a used DVD at a lot less cost.

This is supposed to be an easy posting he has been given after a traumatic assassination assignment. The station is breached, and he and the code broadcaster need to deal with the breach, and hopefully survive without help from the outside.
  The acting and the setting are spot on, but some basic premises of the movie are really ridiculous:
1. The CIA assassinates operatives rather than retire them, 2. It assassinates it's own employees and even civilians who ""know too much"" and 3. Does it all on American as well as British soil, and without law enforcement interfering. Aside from that, one has to ask how they successfully recruit if people don't get out of the agency alive. Also, people are assassinated for ""knowing too much"" when its perfectly obvious that they know nothing particularly compromising. If you can suspend the need for the plot to make sense, it can be enjoyable to watch.

5658972,3,B00BNH9NCU,"The movie is dark in tone and cinematography. It takes place mostly in one building, almost all of it in a single room. The screenplay seems as though it might have been written as a play, and it's interesting to imagine this being produced as one.

The story is nothing new -- bad guys break into a supposedly secure facility and our hero must keep them at bay long enough for his partner to try to hack the central computer system. He is tormented by memories of the dark work he had to do himself when in the field, before being assigned to mind the numbers station.

Viewers are expected to believe some bizarrely weak spycraft. Top secret facilities communicate situation and orders to each other without mutually confirming each others' identities. Malin Ackerman's character cracks a top secret code in a manner so trivial as to evoke Mad Magazine's mocking of Star Trek 2, thirty years ago. ""Crack the code? But it would be impossible for one to . . .""  ""Four One Two! That's the code, Captain.""

It's a flawed movie, of interest primarily as a sort of continuation of Grosse Pointe Blank, had John Cusack's character never visited his high school reunion.",1370995200,,1164,4.663414634146341

Cusack plays a CIA hit man and Ackerman plays a civilian contractor employed by the CIA for her computer encryption skills.  Most movies about the CIA or spycraft invariable play up the gadgets, awesome fighting skills, cool vehicles and unbelievable shoot-outs.  Not here.  The setting is a refitted military base used to send signals to spies.  The only gadgets we see are computers and transmission equipment.  No fancy weapons, just handguns.  However, this movie came across as quite believable.

5658978,4,B00BNH9NCU,"John Cusack is a terrific actor and he proves it once again in The Numbers Station. Recently, Cusack has done a lot more direct-to-video stuff, deciding to be a big fish in a much smaller pond, and it has worked out very well. The Numbers Station is a secret CIA base in a secluded part of England, where encoded messages are sent to agents in the field. Emerson (John Cusack) was one of those agents, until his conscience caught up with him, and he is assigned to guard the station, a quiet, lonely job, until terrorists break in, and he is the last line of defense. A movie like this, with a small cast in a secluded location, only works if the stars of the film can keep you're attention and make the story believable, and both Cusack and Malin Akerman both do a terrific job of it. This movie is more about the intensity of the situation and the reaction of the people involved than it is about killing bad guys, and that is why Cusack was perfect choice for the lead in this film. Few actors bring the experience of intensity that John Cusack brings to a project. The story here, wasn't anything unique or extraordinary, but it was an action film from a more psychological point of few. Most action films are more about big explosions and special effects, the story is secondary, but in The Numbers Station, things are reversed and that's why I liked it so much. It's a fun film, that will keep you guessing, with a cast that will engage you the whole way.

8571626,3,B00BNH9NCU,"The history of Hollywood spy movies follows a course roughly parallel to the changing connotations of the word ""nationalism.""  In the first half of the last century, ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"" were similar in meaning, and both words were used to describe virtuous, upright behavior on behalf of one's country.  It was even good to be a lowly spy, like Nathan Hale, who regretted that he had but one life to give for his country.  Hollywood hewed to the line:  that, after all, was the profitable way to go.  But then along came Senator McCarthy and the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and the era of weepy ""persecution"" of various Hollywood flunkeys began (many of these flunkeys had been quietly humping the leg of the far left and its Soviet ""paradise"" for decades, but never mind, they considered themselves privileged and untouchable).  The ""global"" view, in which all men are palsy-walsies, or would be if not for evil nationalist politics, gradually came to dominate elements of western culture (especially artsy-fartsy elements), with Hollywood in the front line.

You can certainly argue about this stuff, but to me, the landmark spy movie for this tipping of the equation from nationalism = good to nationalism = evil is 1965's ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold,"" based on the novel by John le Carre.  In that movie:

--  The hero is an anti-hero with a threadbare sense of duty, but an overwhelmingly fashionable sense of existential angst, and a craving for alcohol
--  The girl is a poor, deluded muffin  (what le Carre chick isn't?)
--  The country and its leaders are tawdry and despicable, likely to be guilty of far greater evil than the supposed ""enemy""
--  The object of the mission may seem clear and obvious, but is not.  It is likely that the bosses are lying about it, for they are compulsive liars and users
--  Spies will not be honored for their successes.  At best their bosses will ignore them; at worst, they will eliminate them

Cartoonish James Bond movies aside, this has been the template for virtually every spy movie ever since.  Just for the fun of it, rent Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Saboteur.""  It is a classic spy movie of the old school, in which ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"" were not so much sneered at.  Make it a double feature with the le Carre movie, and you will see exactly how much the culture aped by Hollywood changed between 1942 (a war year) and 1965.  As the Frick and Frack television lawyers like to say, ""you might be surprised.""

""The Numbers Station"" was released in 2013.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about it.  It is scrupulously faithful to the bullet points above.  Cusack is good as always, Malin Akerman is good enough.  The plot is a little hard to swallow, as is often the case with this genre.  The dialogue, however, is crisp, and the direction is fast-paced, yet not so fast that the audience cannot follow it.  Suspense is maintained throughout.  Fairly violent, but not particularly gory or gruesome.  Like all movie protagonists, these two seem impervious to injury:  bullets seem to go out of their way to avoid them, and shortly after Cusack sews up a shrapnel wound in her leg and gives her a shot of feelgood, Akerman all but tap-dances through the remainder of the movie.  No sex -- thankfully, as Cusack is considerably older than Akerman, and looks it.

There is a certain perfunctoriness to the movie.  The plot, for all of its new-fangled techie allure, strikes me as a by-the-numbers rendition of the standard post-1965 template, and that's all folks.  Doesn't make it unwatchable:  in fact, it is a movie you could watch every day, because you will forget the plot five minutes after it ends.  But still, it makes for a couple of reasonably entertaining hours, and since I am a fan of the genre, I'll settle.  They don't make ""The Saboteur"" anymore.",1523404800,,3866,4.739130434782608
