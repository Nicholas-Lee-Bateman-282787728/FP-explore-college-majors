8193304,5,B000PTYK84,"If you love the ocean and lots of waves you will adore this. Scenes of the Pacific Coast are accompanied by original melodic and relaxing music, mostly piano. You can hear the wave sounds along with the music. There are a few scenes of seagulls but it is not overwhelming. One scene remains for quite some time as if you were overlooking the ocean from a cliff and the seagulls are flying around for a while. The birds definitely got my cat's attention!

This DVD has scenes of powerful waves and also scenes of calm settings where the water is not moving at all. The widescreen camera captures the coastline in all its vast beauty. The colors are luxuriously vibrant and almost velvety. Sometimes scenes change faster, sometimes the camera moves ever so slowly from the left or right without being shaky.

This is 59 minutes and I will say that once I watched it I wanted to watch it again immediately. It was so relaxing and beautiful. I felt like it ended too soon but fortunately it just starts replaying itself automatically.

8193305,1,B000PTYK84,"I just bought companion title to this disk, on Bali.
Also Living Landscapes Blu-ray.
The player I have is a nearly new Sony Blu-ray player about 3 months old and I have played many other commerically produced Blu-ray disks by regular film studios and they all play until this Blu-ray disk on BALI.  It says cannont play the disk on the screen.
Why is there a compatability issue if the disk is Blu-ray and the machine is a Sony, the main backer and maker of Blu-ray format and machines.
Very upset about this and I have called LIVING LANDSCAPES twice on the phone number on the cover of the disk and they do not return my calls.  I get the feeling they are a very small time operation and who knows about the quality control of their disk burning.  I could not tell from the outside of the cover if the disk was really Blu-ray as no place on the cover does it say Blu-ray, but it was in the traditional Blu-ray BLUE PLASTIC disk cover.  Inside package the actual disk DOES say Blu-ray but when placed in machine the Sony player says cannot play disk!!!!!!

8193307,1,B000PTYK84,"I was looking for a dvd that had ocean surf with just the natural sounds. The cover pic on this dvd does say ""with original music"", but the usual standard today is to offer an option screen where you can turn the music off if you want. So I went ahead and bought it.

You can't turn the music off! Not only that, but it's this hideous new age type stuff, mostly harp and piano, and the music track is set so loud it completely drowns out the sounds of the waves and seagulls. The composition is uncreative to the point of annoyance. I like new age okay, I enjoy listening to George Winston for instance, but this stuff is boring and goopy, like something you'd hear in the background of a bad romance movie.

There is also what appears to be a scene selection screen at the beginning, but it doesn't work! The first one is highlighted and you can't move it to a different one, all you can do is start it.

The pictures are quite beautiful and show a nice selection of lovely spots all up and down the Pacific coast. But the music is so...just...yuck...that I actually ended up hitting the Mute button on the tv and popping and old ocean surf cd into the stereo. Not exactly what you want to have to do with a 20 dollar dvd.",1178409600,9,1223,4.217948717948718
