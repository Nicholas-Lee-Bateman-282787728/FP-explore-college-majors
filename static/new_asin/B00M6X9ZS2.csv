6561744,3,B00M6X9ZS2,"Not enough here to justify splitting it into a 2 season finale.  This trend of stretching things out beyond there actual worth leaves one with a bad taste about the whole show (or movie) by the end of it all.  I also don't feel the anticipation I usually feel about the upcoming Mad Men season as I feel like they're milking it for all its worth and leave us fans hanging to do so.  I'm sure I'll still watch the 2nd final (or the final final ( or the final 2.0)), but I'm also sure that I won't be discussing it with people with the same joy and excitement I did before.  I'm pretty sure I won't even bring Mad Men up so I'll avoid talking about this annoying tactic of calling something a final season and then splitting it in half.  Not a good trend, and the show is great, but the 3 star rating is definitely deserved.  It is maybe even too generous, but other than this garbage, it's still a good show.",1408233600,14,907,4.154285714285714
6561745,1,B00M6X9ZS2,The Penultimate release of essentially half a season at full price in an attempt to get you to pay double when part 2 rolls around and you have to pay all over again. Don Draper would be proud..,1408060800,111,194,4.131578947368421
6561746,5,B00M6X9ZS2,If youve made it this far you might as well keep going. Great series overall.,1511913600,,77,4.2
6561747,5,B00M6X9ZS2,Don't buy this unless you're willing to buy all six seasons because you will be hooked. Mad Men should come with an addiction warning.,1510185600,,134,4.625

6561753,2,B00M6X9ZS2,"Rip off.  Why is 1 season sold as 2 separate dvd sets?
Whatever happened to happy endings? Didn't need the tragedy.  And whatever happened to an ending??  Guess everyone is supposed to make up their own.  Won't ever watch anything by Weiner again. Very poor way to end the show.",1493424000,,278,4.5
6561754,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"I had to wait until I could see all of these seasons, before I could rate the DVD's of them. All I can say now is ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!, and I thoroughly enjoy the special features that are included. I followed all of Mad Men when it was on AMC, and really enjoyed reliving it all now. I cherish this collection!",1491955200,,312,4.216666666666667

6561756,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"What's not to love about the final season of Mad Men?  You've got steamy Don,  drunk Don, flirty Don, I own the room Don, plus Betty, Rodger, Pete, Joan, Peggy, the list could go on and on.  These are some of the greatest characters in TV history, and are developed so well by the writers and actors.  The way they evolve through the series is awesome to watch.  I binged watched the entire series and found myself totally immersed in the era.  The details of the sets and props are just amazing and so true to the time period.  I highly recommend this series for anyone that wants to escape to a simpler time.  Enjoy",1487289600,,617,4.304347826086956
6561757,5,B00M6X9ZS2,Love it!,1486339200,,8,3.5
6561758,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"I bought this so I could complete my collection of the entire season. My wife and I love the series. In the final season we learn of how the careers of our favorite characters meet their fate.

Don Draper is getting burned out. His second marriage is not going well, his job with the company he started is still on the rocks, and although he's being courted by other agencies, he stubbornly pursues a chance to return to his old job. But there are conditions! No drinking for one (an impossible task for a man like Draper).

The final season comes in 2 parts. You won't be disappointed. Their clothes, behaviors, the things we see that remind us of that time are all good reasons to watch this. My generation appreciates a lot of this series. I like how they talk about the introductions of things we are familiar with now, like Hershey's Bar, Clorox, and many more. This series is well-done and I highly recommend it.",1484265600,2,918,4.491017964071856

6561882,4,B00M6X9ZS2,I hate split finales but if you liked Mad Men then this season further humanizes the characters with backstories.  But if all the constant sleeping around and smoking and drinking aren't you're thing...well you probably never made it to season two anyway.,1438992000,,255,5.071428571428571
6561883,5,B00M6X9ZS2,Like all the other seasons this one is excellent.  Mad Men has probably been the best t.v. show in modern times and this half season does not disappoint.  The only real problem is waiting for the second half of the final season; I don't see why it should take so long for it to be released on blu-ray.

6561889,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"I never watched Mad Men on TV.  I discovered it on Netflix and watched 83 episodes in four days.  I was pleasantly surprised with the 50s and 60s music, had forgotten what great, clothes we wore ala Givenchy and Audrey.  Current events of Eisenhower/Nixon, Kennedys of Camelot, Cuban Missile Crisis, the murders of John, Martin and Bobby, Viet Nam, Civil Rights, the first man on the Moon, all brought back memories of the times and events as well as personal.  The 60s were the most eventful and exciting decade I can remember.  The writers kept it honest and the characters were brought to life by excellent actors.  I had forgotten that we all chain smoked back then on planes, in hospitals, restaurants, offices, etc.  Nothing was politically correct!  Of course the episodes I liked best were those where Don Draper was the center ring.  I look forward to Part 2 and hope the writers continue to mesmerize us to (hopefully)a very happy ending!",1437609600,,948,4.766871165644171

Having seen Jon Hamm in the movie he recently made, I think he is perfect for the MM character, but really not good at much else. We shall see what happens when the show finally closes. The writing has been good on this show, and I have particularly enjoyed the way the fifties and sixties have been portrayed having lived through those times but not in the USA (In UK) so it has given me a really good look at the USA during those two decades.

6561963,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"I bought this mainly for the audio commentary as I had already watched (and loved) this season on air. I enjoy hearing behind-the-scenes insight into the show from the creator and others, which lets me squeeze just a bit more out of my Mad Men fix before it vanishes for good when the series ends this year. One downside is that it appears none of the actors where involved in the audio commentary this time -- directors, the costume designer, writers, etc, take center stage. (On a past season Vincent Kartheiser aka Pete's commentary was light-hearted and funny, a total opposite of his character on the show. As a fan, it's fun to discover little surprises like that.) It's not enough of a downside to ruin this package, though. There are some other fairly unexciting bonus materials, all listed in the product description here on Amazon. So far, none of them were that interesting, but I haven't finished them all yet. For me, the audio commentary was the draw, and it has been worth the purchase. And of course, going back and re-watching the wonderful episodes again as I prepare for the final half of the last season to air in April (it will be missed).",1424822400,,1160,4.635922330097087

6561975,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 6 seasons now.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He was a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He had it all. And yet he can never peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away. And more often than not, it succeeds.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par&eacute; as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the early 60's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes the first part of the ongoing season 7. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

6561994,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"mad men  the final season part 1 is a three disc dvd set that features gay rights, gay power, the trial of Chicago, and the best things in life are free. Disc one has a picture of the don draper (jon hamm) character,  while the other two discs have visuals of don drapers current wife megan draper (Jessica pare) and peggy olson (Elisabeth moss).  However, I did notice that there was a picture of the betty francis character once I placed the first dvd in the divd player. The characters of betty francis (January jones), joan harris (Christina Hendricks), pete Campbell (Vincent cartheiser), sally draper (Kiernan shipka), bert copper (Robert morse), roger sterling (john slattery) along with other actors/actresses return to the show. One thing that I do like about the show is that the writing was done in a way to show the reality of what the characters were dealing with during the time period that the series is set in while trying to think outside of the box in how to treat their employees with respect and dignity. For instance, there is a scene where Don Draper is speaking to one of his female employees at his home regarding work related concerns and he insists on compensating her despite her reluctance to ask. There is then the character of joan harris who is called to deal with how to treat one of her employees with dignity when she is asked by bert cooper to move the employee to a less controversial spot.  Joan harris is shown being naturally uncertain as to the best way to deal with the situation at first while taking care to treat the employee affected with dignity.

It is sad the Season 7 is the end of the series. AMC decided to split this into two parts, so we get an extra episode. I enjoyed Part 1 of Season 7 when it was shown. The DVD set has some interesting commentaries and other extra features.",1418515200,5,510,4.151515151515151

The others are underutilized.  I am only staying with Mad Men because it has been so great up until now, but judging by these episodes, they should have ended the show last season.

6562043,3,B00M6X9ZS2,"This series has taken a turn for the worse. Now that it is ending the writing has suffered to the point that it feels as if the writers just want to make it out alive at any cost. The stories are fragmented like a jigsaw puzzle that has pieces that don't belong. Very little makes sense and even some of the actors seem to be phoning it in. I keep buying the series because I've come this far but also because I keep waiting for that magic to re-appear, but then I think I might be waiting a while.",1415145600,3,498,4.040404040404041

This is one of the five best shows on TV, and one of the best ever.  Nice special features; I guess they realized the lack of audio commentary on the Season Six discs was a mistake. The commentaries are back, and as enlightening and interesting as ever. So what if it's ""only"" Part One.  I own every season, and will be among the first to pre-order ""Mad Men: The Complete Series"" at the earliest opportunity.  It is bound to be a spectactular package.

I'm sure the quality will be great as when I watched it on HD cable...
Not happy about the long wait for second half or the crazy high price for half a season.
This is my favorite show, so I'm always up to date while watching on TV.
I've purchased all the seasons on Blu-ray for $20 or under 8 or 9 months after the season ends.
Three stars are for the wait and the price of half a season...the show and the Blu-rays themselves are always 5 stars!",1408406400,22,483,4.094736842105263
8670459,2,B00M6X9ZS2,"The final season of ""Mad men"" on blu-ray arrived today, and I must say that things have really gone downhill as far as packaging goes from Lionsgate. In the beginning you got solid blu-ray cases, often with a nice outer slipcover on the outside as well, but those days seems to be long gone.

For the final season of this great series you get two discs housed inside one of those flimsy, horrible Elite eco-cases - the ones with the open holes under the blu-ray discs. This is a case that I really dislike since it practically always means that I will receive a blu-ray with a damaged cover due to the poor quality of these blu-ray cases. The final season of ""Mad men"" proved to be no exception - there are several dents on the front and back of the cover. And there is no outer slipcover included either, which could have protected the case inside. The previous seasons of ""Mad Men"" came with a slipcase cover on blu-ray - so why not the final season??

This is the reason why I stopped buying ""Weeds"" from Lionsgate on blu-ray. I got so tired of getting damaged blu-ray covers that looked like something the cat had dragged in, and never bothered to finish the series.",1528243200,,1170,4.437209302325582

8670463,5,B00M6X9ZS2,"Mad Men begins its terminal season as we watch the continuing devolution of Madison Avenue advertising wizard Don Draper.  Its 1969 and Don (Jon Hamm) is on paid leave from Sterling, Cooper & Partners after he drunkenly blows a pitch with a client last season.  Hes using Freddy Rumsen  as a proxy for submitting work to the agency between trips to the west coast to see his actress wife Megan (Jessica Pare).  Dons tried to clean up his act drinking less and cutting back on his womanizing but things are strained with Megan.  Finally Don gets to come back to the agency but with Draconian rules that clearly are designed to set him up for failure so he can be terminated.

  Theres plenty of other drama involving the rest of the cast as well; Roger (John Slattery) takes to the free love movement and indulges in orgies with hippies, Peggy (Elizabeth Moss) continues to assert herself at SC&P despite the gender discrimination of the day, smarmy Pete Campbell (Vincent Cartheiser) is frustrated working with Ted in the California satellite office and is separated from his wife Trudi (Alison Brie) while taking up with his pretty blonde realtor, and Ginsburg has a meltdown over his paranoia with the new IBM computer installed at the agency to name just a few of the many happenings in these seven episodes.

  Finally on the eve of the Apollo 11 moon landing series regular Burt Cooper (Robert Morse) passes away from natural causes.  The closing scene for the season is Don imagining Coopers still alive and performs a song and dance rendition of The Best Things In Life Are Free complete with choreographed dancing secretaries.  This could easily have been overly sentimental schlock in lesser hands but Matt Weiner crafts it into a touching tribute to a legacy character.

  It is hard to believe there are only seven more episodes remaining in this terrific series.  Great writing and the gifted cast clearly earn all the many accolades Mad Men has won.",1522540800,,1962,4.791666666666667

The plastic disc holder portion that is glued to the cardboard is falling off. The adhesive didn't keep it glued down. I might have to superglue it. As far as the show is concerned, its a good show.
