2214598,5,B0007KIFM8,"My 18 month old daughter, a big Teletubbies fan, loves this DVD. It keeps her attention for at least 15 minutes at a time. She loves doing her ""exercises"" with the Teletubbies when we have to stay inside. The first segment has the Tubbies go down for a nap after repeatedly standing up/sitting down, walking side to side, etc. so it's a good point to stop the DVD and put your little one down too. The ""Head, Shoulders, Knees & Toes"" shows different people of all ages doing the dance. It's nice that they show kids and adults fall out of step with the words so your child doesn't feel bad about not following along perfectly, especially when the pace picks up. One segment shows a little girl that decides to just dance when the song goes too fast. It's hysterical. If you're watching it with your child be warned - the Head, Shoulders, Knees & Toes segment goes on forever (to the delight of children I'm sure).",1170201600,5,913,4.440476190476191
2214599,5,B0007KIFM8,"This DVD allows your toddler to get up and move, learning about body parts and picking up new skills.  My 2 yr. old's favorite segment is the ""Heads and shoulder, knees and toes"" one, where you get to see kids trying the exercise as well as the Teletubbies.  I would highly recommend if you're looking for a way to burn energy on cold or rainy days.",1142380800,5,349,4.2727272727272725

8047682,5,B0007KIFM8,"I ordered this DVD at the beginning of winter after beginning to babysit a 1 1/2 & 3 yr old. Thank goodness I did, after the very cold winter we've had!  Definitively helped with getting those wiggled out that come from being cooped up for weeks!  Both children really enjoy doing the exercises, and when the younger's attention for actually ""doing"" wanes, she is still happy to watch, whether it's the DVD or myself doing the exercises, lol.  There are actually 2 different episodes so you can change it up a bit.  Very pleased with purchase!  :-)",1394928000,,548,4.608247422680412
8047683,5,B0007KIFM8,"my two years old boy now he's into exercise after this DVD, I just simple love it, kids learn a lot from it.",1359590400,,108,3.739130434782609
8047684,5,B0007KIFM8,My son loves the Teletubbies so if you have a young one at home with a similar penchant then I would highly recommend this DVD.  At first he didn't follow along with the exercises but now when it is on he will do some of the exercises with the Teletubbies but he tends to start laughing at their antics and just enjoys the silliness instead of joining in with the exercise.  A must for children who enjoy the Teletubbies.,1221955200,,421,4.3164556962025316
8047685,5,B0007KIFM8,This is the best of the 4 or 5 I purchased. My 14 mo. old daughter loves it and follows the exercise movements. Even my husband likes it.,1214092800,,137,3.9285714285714284

8047688,5,B0007KIFM8,My 18 mos baby girl is a big fans of Teletubbies. She can watch Teletubbies all day. This DVD is part of her Teletubbies collection.,1193270400,,132,4.32
8047689,5,B0007KIFM8,My 2 1/2 yr old loves the Teletubbies. This is a great video for her. She does the exercises and sings the head shoulder knees and toes song. It is 80 minutes long and it is very interactive. To some the Tubbies may be annoying but to others they are so cute and great for little ones. Good DVD,1175212800,2,294,4.0
