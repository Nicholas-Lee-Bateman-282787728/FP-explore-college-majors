6381336,3,B00JLJ0BAA,"The story is ok, a little confusing though. The animal sound effects are obviously people mimicking them. They couldn't afford a soundboard? It nearly ruined the movie listening to the horrible animal sounds. The voice acting is great, scripting is like watching a made for TV movie for little kids and animation is good.",1474761600,,321,4.962962962962963
6381337,5,B00JLJ0BAA,"I found this movie on KissCartoon's website and just had to find a copy.  This is an excellent coming-of-age story with enough action, adventure, fantasy, magic, young romance, and family values to satisfy anyone's taste at any age.  Highly recommended!",1458604800,,253,5.3

6381343,5,B00JLJ0BAA,"This is an excellent movie with good characters, a plot with many twists and turns, and without all the tropes and cliches we see repeated ad nauseam in so many animated movies.

The sea goddess becomes angry because the tribal shaman is calling on evil spirits, and punishes the clan by sealing all the animals away in a paradise called Sarila, leaving the clan to starve in the frozen wasteland.  Only the pure of heart may enter the land of Sarila and ask the goddess for her forgiveness.  Advised by the evil shaman, the chief sends three young people:his own son, his son's fiancee, and a young man with shamanic powers, who the shaman sees as an upcoming rival. On the journey, the three battle the forces of nature and the shaman's evil powers.

The animation is not Pixar-level by any means, but the scenes manage to be quite beautiful at times. The main female character is pretty useless, but there are a couple of other female characters who are decent.

Better for older kids than younger.",1404691200,,1001,4.632768361581921
6381344,3,B00JLJ0BAA,"this movie just came out within the past 6 months under the name of Frozen Land through Kaboom! Entertainment. if you have that movie, then this one is just a repackage of it with the original title to confuse people into buying the same movie twice. look for the reviews using the other name to decide if it is worth your hard earned money.",1398470400,4,341,4.34375

8652204,4,B00JLJ0BAA,"The visuals look quite nice and the voice acting is pretty passable. The story has a certain indie film feel to it, which might explain why it might feel eccentric to some. Kind of a bummer the film got a bad rap by the shoddy distributor repackaging the film through copyright-infringing tactics. It really should've been more appropriate if it were one of those IMAX 3D films that I see being exhibited in science/history museums. I'm quite impressed they didn't approach IMAX at first since they're both Canadian products and according to the trivia it's a film that's meant to be shown in 3D.",1517702400,,596,4.740384615384615
8652205,5,B00JLJ0BAA,"We enjoyed this movie a lot, and it would be ok for kids. It's educational experiencing life as an Eskimo in the Artic region.  Good story, cute characters and magic! It also has a moral about integrity and devotion to the good of the whole.",1511136000,,241,4.355555555555555
8652206,1,B00JLJ0BAA,"The animation is marginal based on today's standards. The landscape boring , repetitive. The storyline  a  little confusing at times. Heavy focus on shamanism and the conjuring up of evil spirits sometimes through blood. The ""good"" shaman uses white magic to fight black evil magic by conjuring up ""good"" spirits. Really? find a better way to teach children good values such as forgiveness, bravery, humility, love. Do not recommend!",1510185600,3,433,5.260869565217392

8652209,5,B00JLJ0BAA,"Excellent movie!  Everything was great:  the story, the animation, the acting.  It was really interesting to see what life is maybe like for some Inuit people, too.  I would recommend it for everyone -- kids and adults alike.  And it's not too scary for young 'uns.",1507420800,2,265,4.673913043478261
8652210,5,B00JLJ0BAA,"Apparently a large entertainment company sued the filmmakers of The Legend of Sarila for copyright infringement when the distribution company used a stylized version of the word ""frozen."" It's great a version of this film is still available. As well as the voices Christopher Plummer and Genevieve Bujold in main roles, the singer Elisapie Isaac sings three songs for the soundtrack. This is a family friendly film that tells a story about an Inuit tribe from the early twentieth century. Seems everyone wants to go back to the days of Downton Abbey. There's magic, a bad-guy Shaman, and a good guy, and the usual stuff about following the heart you get in American animation. But it's a slightly different backdrop, and some of the landscapes are very beautiful. Even if the characters are a bit stiff at times, overall character design is quite charming. A fun film.",1477267200,,868,4.91156462585034
