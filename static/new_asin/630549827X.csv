1040842,5,630549827X,"I was interested in this low-budget 1992 film because it starred Edie Falco of ""The Sopranos"" before she got famous, and because the setting was an Italian American neighborhood in Brooklyn. The characters are all ""wanna be"" gangsters who think they are tough guys. There are two couples in the story and Edie Falco is a hard-working young married woman who argues a lot with her husband even though you can tell that the two of them are in love.  They are friends with another couple who fight and break up all the time. The boyfriend is physically abusive and and Edie Falco does a lot of consoling her friend.  All of them hang out in bars and the men are involved in petty crime, including a lot of shoplifting.  Into this mix comes another friend who is on parole from jail.  He is definitely a bad guy and is trying to sell guns, much to Edie Falco's displeasure.  Everyone talks and argues all the time.  It was a bunch of losers living on the edge and playing with fire.  Naturally, one of them gets shot.

I know this wasn't a great film.  In fact it probably wouldn't even get on the playing field for any kind of award.  But it moved fast, the characters were interesting and quirky, and I really got into the grittiness of it all.  I liked their youth and vim and vinegar even though it was obvious that they were all losers. And, unlike ""The Sopranos"", nobody ever makes any real money and they are always poor.

Frankly, I loved this film and give it a high rating.  I found it interesting and very very real even though I know it is not for everyone.",1166918400,7,1565,4.355172413793103

1040844,2,630549827X,"I read the reviews for this movie and really wanted to see it. Peter Greene is what caught my attention because he is a great actor just never made it as big as he should of. Well after I watched this movie I was extremely dissappointed. It didn't seem like the same movie everyone was reviewing PLUS! everything on the pictures on the front and back of the box IS NOT IN THE MOVIE! The picture of Johnny on the back holding the gun, yeah that never happends, nor is Peter Greenes character the way he is on the cover. I don't understand why they would put all that on the box and not have any of it in the movie.",1116115200,,613,4.074380165289257
1040845,5,630549827X,"This is a very realistic film about life in the city. It deals with characters whose way of life has been and continues to be, about crime. Peter Greene plays the lead and as always gives a superb performance.(He has also been in The Usual Suspects, The Mask, and Clean Shaven)
It's very surprising this didn't launch Director Nick Gomez's career into the fast lane. The perspective of each individual character is so raw and believable, that it feels like you could have known these characters in your own life. It is easy to empathize with the characters and get wrapped up in the film due to the ingenious/realistic dialogue. Kudos! to all the actors in the film and the Director. This is a real work of art, seeing as how ""art imitates life"".",1043280000,19,746,4.574626865671642
1040846,5,630549827X,"This little known, understated movie is one of the most hauntingly realistic portrayals of the life of crime ever made.
The acting is superb.  Many people will recognize Edie Falco of recent Sopranos fame, (and you will also see some other faces which have appeared in many HBO features such as Oz)
The movie portrays a group of disenfranchised young people existing largely by their wits as subsistance criminals, attempting unsuccesfully to cope with their own shortcomings and with the hostile world around them.  Another reviewer compared this to Mean Streets, and it is similar, but not in my opinion derivitive.  Like Mean Streets this movie was created by someone who knows the lifestyle because they lived it.  Unlike larger budget gangster movies Mean Streets was in fact ahead of it's time for it's unflinching realism and ability to find the drama and pathos in lives of the less spectacular ""gangsters"" out there.  Laws of gravity also does a good job of this, in a more low budget camera style which is somewhat reminiscent of more recent works like the psudo documentary ""Kids"".  But unlike Kids, you will not only recognize these people, you will feel for them, because while being realistic and realistically flawed personalities, they are trying to do what they think is right.
This movie meant a lot to me because as a young person growing up in New Orleans, I led a very similar existance.  In fact this affected me much as the original ""Suburbia"" (about the lives of young punk rockers) did.  You want to know what the criminal underworld is REALLY like without all the glamour and phony hollywood hype? As someone who has been there, I can tell you, this quiet little movie is spot on.",1007164800,13,1706,4.798634812286689

7890744,5,630549827X,"When I rented this Laws of Gravity years ago the video review book I had at home called it a ""TURKEY."" The lowest of the low. Zero out of five. But I watched it anyway because I thought how bad could it be. Besides, even an awful movie can be great for its awfulness - if that makes any sense. I watched it once. Then I watched it again. I was mesmerized at the power of the story telling. The acting was raw but hardly amateurish. Then my friend came over and watched with me. There is something about this that is so simple and powerful. It's also the first film ( I believe) that Edie Falco stared in and it's wonderful to see her so young an bursting with talent. Maybe because I grew up in Brooklyn among guys like this that I related to it so deeply. But the friend of mine who watched it with me was the product of London's finest schools. I'm so glad I found it for sale and can't wait to watch it again and again. If you've never seen it take a chance on it. You won't be sorry.",1397174400,,987,4.0152284263959395

7890746,5,630549827X,SAW THIS ON TV MANY YEARS AGO AND HAD IT ON VHS (I RECORDED IT OFF TV WHEN IT WAS ON). WHILE WATCHING NURSE JACKIE I WANTED TO READ UP ABOUT EDIE FALCO) AND SAW HER ON THE ELLEN SHOW. I LOOKED UP HER BIOGRAPHY ONLINE AND READ WHAT ELSE SHE DID AND REMEMBERED THIS MOVIE WHICH I ALWAYS LOVED AND ORDERED IT WITHIN SECONDS. WATCHED IT ABOUT 5 TIMES WITHIN 2 WEEKS. BEING FROM BKLYN NY WHERE IT WAS FILMED I LOVED THE WAY IT WAS FILMED IN THE STREETS AND NOT IN A STUDIO. IT IS SUCH A GREAT FLICK AT A GREAT PRICE. EDIE FALCO FANS WILL NOT BE LET DOWN. AND MAN DOES SHE AGE WELL LIKE A FINE WINE.IF YOU GO TO HER WEB SITE AND ASK FOR AN AUTOGRAPHED PIC SHE DOESNT EVEN CHARGE YOU FOR IT.,1341705600,,684,3.7902097902097904
7890747,5,630549827X,"I ran across this movie many years ago at Blockbuster and never let go.. doh.  This film is just raw and captivating (am I repeating myself?).  It captures the gritty essence of street life and draws the viewer right into the middle of all the action as if just tagging along.  There's no big plots or mind bending conspiracies... just a raw documentary like glimpse in the lives of some young adults in Brooklyn.  I can't remember the last movie that drew me in like that EVER. Too bad this one didn't get released on DVD.  One of the BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME, just my take.",1280620800,,574,4.327102803738318
7890748,5,630549827X,"it's not trying to be some epic Scrocese film. it's a story about a couple of mooks who just screw up and lie and shine it when you call them on it, and their slow spiral down. you're a fly on the wall, right up close.
the handheld camera work is pretty amazing, really tight closeups on the characters, with a rhythm that just grips you and yanks you around, so much so that, when i first saw it in the theaters, when the scene finally broke you could hear the whole theater exhale. why is this not on DVD please?",1207785600,2,514,4.099009900990099
