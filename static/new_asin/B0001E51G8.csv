1993310,4,B0001E51G8,"This video is a good overview of the Nazi era by an American journalist who was there during the period leading up to WWII. Shirer was not a historian, but he still did a remarkable job with his landmark book, ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."" Shirer, because of his work, knew many of the Nazi leaders, and he is quoted in several histories of the Nazi era. His famous  counterpart in London was Edward R. Murrow.  This black-and-white video, which is introduced by Shirer, is a history of Adolf Hitler's rise to power to his death in his bunker in Berlin. I'm not sure, but the way it is introduced, with the MGM logo and music, leaves me the impression that this was produced for showing in movie theaters. Be that as it may, it does cover a lot of video footage/ground that other Hitler series seem to leave out. It is somewhat dated, for instance, when the video presents as fact that the Nazis set the Reichstag fire, which is now questioned by historians.  (Regardless of who set it, Adolf Hitler used it to set up his dictatorship.) If you've ever wondered about what the Nazi era was like, how Hitler came to power, or even if you need to see for yourself that Hitler was only a terrible, but still human, person instead of a larger-than-life historical figure, check out this video... and definitely read William L. Shirer's book!!!",1080345600,14,1348,4.516393442622951

1993340,4,B0001E51G8,"I was born in 1935, a,third generation American of German decent, and have spent my life attempting to understand the failure of the German populace to maintain a sense of morality in dealing with this Creation. My father spent his life denouncing the weakness that allowed Germans to accept the atrocities, and capitulate to the hatred for other members of the human race. Still, to this day, I have a feeling of antagonism toward the German race, and in fact retired from our Military three years earlier than planned, so as not to have to serve a three year tour of duty in Germany. My father often referred to Germans as Sheep, that were led to slaughter, and this Book assisted in my quest for understanding.
It has also helped me to understand how our present political power actually allowed the beginning of the ruination of this once wonderful America.  My dime, well spent!",1361404800,11,883,4.733766233766234
1993361,4,B0001E51G8,"Good book. It tells you alot about how Hitler got to power and his defeat and his craziness is unsurpassed. If you like books about WW2 and the Holocaust, you will love this one. It makes me sympathize all the more with the Jews, and makes me dislike the Germans because of their indifference to the Jews deaths and tortures. Shame on them....I know there were good Germans that tried to help, and I can understand fear  can keep people from helping those that are helpless, but they worshiped this man and that is why Ive always been angry toward the people of this Era, why did they let it happen, they could have stopped it in the beginning before he got to power. ...Well do read the book as i highly recommend it.",1358640000,,718,4.358208955223881

1993364,4,B0001E51G8,"This is a great idea by Mill Creek Entertainment, putting two Documentary Series together on one DVD Set. This Set contains the following Series: NAZI HUNTERS-THE REAL STORY and HITLER-THE UNTOLD STORY. This 4-Disc collection contains over 13 Hours of fascinating documentaries about Hitler, the Third Reich and World War II. Both series you'll find on this set are two of the best ever released by Mill Creek Entertainment and I highly recommend this collection to anybody having an interest for History. If, like me, you enjoy watching historical documentaries and if you enjoy learning more about the past, then this collection will be a good addition to your library.

-- Documentary 1: NAZI HUNTERS-THE REAL STORY ( 1 DVD, 1Hour 30 minutes, 2 Episodes )
See the real life pursuit to track down WWII fugitives for their crimes against humanity. This harrowing film presents the true-life tale of the unrelenting pursuit of Eichman, Mengele and other Nazi criminals in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and South America. This gripping documentary recounts the story of the long search for Nazis in hiding from 1945 to the present day. Sixty years of investigations, set-backs, trials and dramas, brought about principally by three extraordinary individuals: the Austrian death camp survivor, Simon Wiesenthal and the German/French couple Beate and Serge Klarsfeld who devoted their lives to search for the highest level Nazi war criminals still at large.

-- Documentary 2: HITLER-THE UNTOLD STORY ( 3 DVD, 12 Hours, 3 Episodes )
This captivating documentary collection provides a brutal, honest and untold portrait of the life and events of history's most evil dictator. Chronicling his early years, his life as a corporal in the army, his dark rise to power and all the way through the downfall of the Third Reich, ""Hitler - The Untold Story"" exposes the terrifying truth throughout 3 poignant programs on 3 DVDs.

Program 1: This 6-part program focuses on the years of Adolf Hitler's political career, from its obscure beginnings to the Nazi leader's final days in the bunker. It recounts the most significant events of his life and follows the Second World War as it unfolds to build up a vivid picture of the personality of the Nazi dictator and those surrounding him, using the most revealing anecdotes and exposing the myths created to maintain Hitler in power and the lies spread by his brutal regime.

Program 2: This 4-part program delivers World War II in a fresh, dramatic, captivating presentation of this epic struggle. From Hitler to Hiroshima documents Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan and Mussolini's Italy as they join forces to crush the free world. Featuring never-before-seen sequences and images collected from years of research and collating through archival footage from non-traditional sources, this epic documentary delivers a unique and horrifying portrait of the Axis Powers' tyrannical campaign to enslave peoples around the globe.

Program 3: From the beginning of the Second World War the sea became a vitally important scene of conflict. Great Britain relied on receiving supplies by sea and, therefore, a total blockade of the United Kingdom was one the main objectives of Hitler's Germany. Headed by Karl Donitz, who would later succeed Hitler as Head of State, the German U-boats gained the initiative in the sea war and from the beginning launched all-out attacks against shipping en route to Great Britain. One of the great unanswered questions of the war is what would have happened if Hitler had granted the numerous requests made by Donitz for more submarines?",1349395200,22,3611,5.144804088586031
1993365,5,B0001E51G8,"Based on the William Shirer's classic book of the same title. And it was my official introduction into Hitler and his nazis when I was a teenager back in the late 1960s. Of course we have many more very good documentaries of this historical period like ""The World in Flames"" from Thames television, ""The Goebbels Experiment"" from German television, and the BBC's World War II series, all good. And many more minor ones, but good, like ""The Big Battles"" from British and Canadian television of the early 1970s. But this one is quite personal for me, and good. There are those who claimed ""Hitler and his Nazis"" weren't that bad, or try to deny the ugliness of the Holocaust. But the verdict of history is right there for all of us to see. Only blind idiot, or a neonazi, can deny the truth. But they can't. And no, it is not a case of ""Allies being bad firebombing Nazi Germany or loving Jews"". It is a case of not tolerating evil, wars and genocide in this world. And as George Santayana once said, ""those who don't remember the past, are condemned to repeat it"". A good documentary, and wish it was in dvd.",1335571200,4,1107,4.458128078817734
1993366,5,B0001E51G8,"THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH (1968) was the first-ever TV mini-series, running 6 hours over three consecutive nights. Shortened by 2/3s, it exists now only as a theatrical release. Lost in the process are many interviews of partcipants, witnesses and victims of the 12 year horror that was Nazi Germany.

The book's author, William L. Shirer appears twice. Stock footage, particularly of Post-WWI Germany is of great interest. Excerpts of several Hitler speeches are seen and heard, but translations are few and subtitles non-existent. Clearly intentional, for this is no unbiased work. At times the outrage and seething hatred for Der Fuhrer is so obvious you can touch it. Narrative insults are employed (not that the bastid didn't deserve 'em!). In its present form,  ""Rise and Fall"" is a fast-moving story consisting  primarily of contemporary war and other footage.

A David L. Wolper production for MGM, directed by Jack Kaufman, written by Alan Landsburg. Film score: Lalo Schifrin (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible/dp/B000HWZ4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission Impossible</a>"").",1244419200,,1154,5.933734939759036
1993367,5,B0001E51G8,"The original ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" was a TV series narrated by Richard Basehart in 1968. It consisted of 3 1-hour episodes over several days. What MGM/Wolper did was to condense the 150+ minutes of that series (minus the commercials) to a 120-minute theatrical release with a different narrator (who was not anywhere as good as Richard Basehart). Why they did not use Richard Basehart as the narrator is beyond me. What was deleted for the theatrical version were all the on-camera interviews, which were the heart of the TV series. I certainly wish that the original 150-minute TV version were released on DVD. That would be a great buy!",1183420800,14,651,4.769911504424779
1993368,4,B0001E51G8,"I saw this two hour version of the book.  It is a nice accompanyment to Shirer's book.  The book is probably the premier book on the Third Reich but the film makes the same points in a nice easy summary.  As the narrator says ""This is all that is left of the Hitler and the Third Reich-photo images""

I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the entire six hour replay of the original would be the best.  However the two hour summary reviews all the main points on this criminal regime.

This is an interesting although disturbing film.  It should be shown in history classes.",1174953600,,583,4.392523364485982
1993369,1,B0001E51G8,"I have looked for the original ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" with Richard Basehart narrating.  I ordered two of these, but they had someone else narrating.  These two hour versions are a rip off.  They don't even come close to the verson aired on TNT back in the 1990s, which probably did not come close to the original 6 hour version.  I contacted the Wolper group at USC and they told me that the original version can only be viewed there.  It apparently was never released in the original version.

1993370,5,B0001E51G8,I had this on VHS years ago and have always remembered it as one of the very best doc's on the politics and problems that led up to the rise and fall of the Nazi Third reich.

8011100,1,B0001E51G8,"An impressive assemblage of historical footage marred by superficial, reductive, distorted narration (and, it seems, the error of attributing an 1821 quote from Heinrich HeineWherever they burn books, in the end they burn people tooto an observer of the Nazi burning of books in the early 1930s). The persecution of the Jews, an integral part of the rise of the Nazi's, is glossed over in one grossly simplistic sentence, dismissing it as simply an anti-communist phenomenon.",1520985600,,475,5.2631578947368425
8011101,1,B0001E51G8,"not what it claims to be and is inaccurate to boot. It calls the Nazis the most brutal regime in modern history. Not really, pick a communist china, Soviets, Cuba, Cambodia, and so on they were all far worse then the Nazis. The facts seem to just fade away in history. Fact at first no jew or political opponents were even jailed for being so. They were exiled individually or in groups. Sadly no country would take the jews. Fact the Soviets had already killed ten million Ukrainians, put millions in gulags, and starved millions more. Later they would assassinate officials and military generals. Estimates from 20 million to over 100 million in the soviets were unjustly killed in horrible ways. And Mao of China was much worse. He had folks split in two or just slowly chopped up day after day. Millions of his own people. He would use them in NBC experiments with gruesome results. No Nazis were not boy scouts but hardly the most brutal. Once most of the world attempted to destroy them they did indeed become quite desperate and more brutal than before the war. But so did almost every other country.",1520121600,,1107,4.624365482233503
8011102,1,B0001E51G8,"This movie is bordering the denial of the Holocaust. It claims as if the Jews were exterminated because they opposed the Nazi regime (together with other political movements like the communists). This is a distortion of history as Richard Basehart  undermines and fails to recognize the unique way the Nazi-Killing-Machine has approached the Jewish population across Europe and where the motivation to annihilate the entire world-wide Jewish population was rooted in basic Nazi ideology - not by political or practical reasons as the movie presents.

8011103,1,B0001E51G8,I rented this on the Docurama channel and was very disappointed that this is not the 1968 Emmy Award Winning David L Wolper documentary that was narrated by Richard Basehart. This is a British made documentary with some British chap doing the narration. I'm really getting tired of finding listings for Richard Basehart only to find out it's something else completely. This version is not near as good. Hopefully someone at Amazon reads these reviews and will correct the information in the listing of this documentary.,1502496000,4,519,5.046511627906977

While technically correct, with just a few snippets of wrong information, the main problem with this narrative is it too often explains the rise and fall of the NAZI Third Reich too quickly and very vague terms while spending too much time on irrelevant aspects. Like I said earlier, the 2 part series ""The Rise"" and then ""The Fall of the Third Reich"" is a much better program to watch.",1486944000,,502,4.294736842105263

This is just a 101 class for dummies, who don't know anything about this period. They didn't really mention my Kampf, barely the holocaust, the German companies helping him, Stalingrad battle, etc....
