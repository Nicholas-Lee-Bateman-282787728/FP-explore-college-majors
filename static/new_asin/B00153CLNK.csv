3140037,5,B00153CLNK,"This movie was well written, and full of surprises. Not your usual boy meets boy love story. Windham Beachman and Matthew Montgomery have done it again in the making of this project. It was well worth the wait. I hope to see them both again in movies / films of this genre.

It was interesting to see how others who were watching this with me thought there were other connections. The ending was not predicted however and leaves the viewer to ponder the possiblities.

3140039,3,B00153CLNK,"This movie cries out for ""bigger"" treatment, with bigger stars (for example, to think really ambitiously, the likes of James Franco with Andrew Garfield, but hopefully featuring the same leading actress, who has a lot of potential for something larger in scope), with a bigger budget, and suggesting bigger horizons. The premise that two persons, in simultaneous near-death experiences, share a bond when one (a man) revives, though the other (a woman) dies, and the surviving male inherits the love of the woman for her erstwhile husband (with many other things in common with the deceased wife) could make a great sci-fi/fantasy motion picture for Hollywood, or, given the sexual angle, an independent studio of means sufficient to make of such a project a grander work, with more vivid and eerie suggestions of the paranormal, than ""Back Soon"" ever could be and could do on such limited production means.

This film nonetheless was made, obviously on a budget too modest to realise fully enough such an ambitious concept, but it still is an interesting one to view. The men of the cast, while lacking glamour as much as more dramatic flair, are reasonably easy on the eyes, although their respective talents are insufficient to draw out to the maximum what is inherent in the scenario.

The result, despite all of the reservations expressed, is a film worth viewing.",1395619200,2,1369,5.0

3140041,5,B00153CLNK,"This is a great movie about it not being the sex of the person you fall in love with, but the person themselves. I love the chemistry between Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham. It's fun, but serious at the same time.",1353801600,2,221,4.414634146341464
3140042,4,B00153CLNK,"You just don't find ambiguity is most American films.  Period.  And, as we see from some other reviews, here and elsewhere, there are lots of folks who really don't like ambiguity.  I can't say, of course, what Rob Williams was ultimately up to here, but, for my part, I found the whole development believable, touching, and, in one scene at least, profoundly moving.  I've lived too long and seen too many a hitherto straight-identified guy suddenly in a love (or sexual) relationship with another straight dude or (more usually) a gay guy, so THAT didn't bother me.  The whole ghost thing (and Maggie Eilertson is wonderful) is handled in a distinctly Jamesian way.  Think TURN OF THE SCREW.  Or the really unnerving THE INNOCENTS with the great and glorious Deborah Kerr from '61.  Is it all real?  Is what we're seeing some kind of psychological projection? Is Logan so drove up he's got to find a succubus to urge him on to Gil? As to the unlikely mixture of Gil's character and Logan's, while another reviewer said it's unbelievable, again, I disagree.  Gil even addresses that issue.

Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham are both, in my opinion, fine actors.  Of a distinctly modern sort, to be sure, but both possess the extraordinary gift of being able to span the gulf between the crazy world of making a film, and our seeing a product that captivates, charms, makes us laugh, or cry.  And that ain't no shabby gift!  I've seen both actors in rather more than a few other films.  Montgomery, who I think is extraordinarily good looking, with a peculiarly testosterone-saturated charisma, I find very attractive indeed.  He's also got one of the most mobile and expressive faces I've ever seen in recent years, able to convey some seriously subtle emotions and riffs going through his head.  Beacham also plays his disparate reactions in such a way that both visibly and audibly you do feel fairly sure you know what's going through his head, too.  What's fascinating is that both men are gay and out and proud, and the ""straight"" characters they create are, as I say, believable and strikingly different:  Gil is clearly the more mature, experienced man to the gawky, somewhat spoiled, and bewildered Logan.

I feel more sorry than otherwise for Artie O'Daly, because while I really liked him in LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP, here he's got, well, let's just say an ungrateful part to play. You'll know what I'm talking about when and if you see the film.  On the other hand, may God be thanked for having given us Kelly Keaton.  One of these days, I'll just betcha, that kid's going to pull a Kathy Bates and surprise the hell out of everyone but me!

Finally, I like Rob Williams' films.  I think he's a really fine director.  However, I do rather think it wouldn't hurt if he got and shared a bit of credit with a more canny and crafty writer.

No spoilers.  But the faults are none of them major, and I heartily recommend this quite original, indeed unique film. . . .",1335052800,7,2978,4.687861271676301
3140043,5,B00153CLNK,"Whao, this movie was good. I didn't expect it to be, but I was really touched by this film. ((Spoiler Alert)) This woman dies and her spirit merges with that of another man who was in an accident with her. The man survives the accident but the woman does not. So the dude is going about minding his own business, when he sees a house for sale and he feels drawn to the house. He meets the owner of the house who is a man who had just lost his wife and he is immediately attracted to the man. To make a long story short the man's wife merged with the other guy and was just returning to her life. So the men form a sort of relationship and things are looking good, until the dude is in another accident and loses the wife's spirit. The men were sad that she was gone, as was the attraction between the two and they cried because for a moment they had both known a great love.

3140044,2,B00153CLNK,"I actually rate this movie 1 1/2 stars.  I did not hate this movie, but I did not like it either.  I certainly would not recommend spending any money on this movie and a part of me is embarrassed to now have this dvd in my movie collection.  The storyline was so paranormally unrealistic.  I wanted to believe, but I couldn't.  Weak all the way around.  I wanted to believe in the characters, but I did not feel a genuine love anywhere in this movie.  Even though I understood the plot, nothing made sense to me.
I believed in Dog Tags.  It has a lower rating on amazon, but I believed in Dog Tags.  I cannot say the same for this movie.  I am so disappointed.",1305072000,2,660,4.166666666666667
3140045,3,B00153CLNK,"And I am faced with the same question twice asked in this film, ""now what do we do""? Following the untimely death of his wife, Logan is selling their dream home which contains way too many memories. It just so happens that the buyer is the same drunk driver who killed Logans wife Adrianne, who seems to be hellbent as a ghost to put these two men together in a relationship, although both of them are straight. I liked this film, yet at the same time I'm a tad confused as to what this movie is really all about. The concept is pretty neat and original, however the story line lacks delivery big time! It's as if the writer is totally burnt out and didn't care about any attention to detail. There are too many vague areas that need answering. The acting of Windham Beacham is excellent and he was very well cast in this film. His character is refreshing but would shine much more with a well written plot. The ""straightness"" of the two characters who just somehow end up in bed together, is very unbelievable. Matthew Montgomery done a fine acting job, but frankly I didn't feel he was well cast here. Too much contrast between he and Beacham, and not very believable that the two could possibly have anything in common or form any kind of connection. Montgomery's lines especially were very scathe and ill written. I loved the house, the backdrops were mostly all perfect. The hospital scenes were lousy, unrealistic, had a very ameteur overtone that stunk. The friendship of Logan and his brother in law Spencer could have had more background given to it as could the love between Logan and Adrianne. The story begins really too far into the plot, and begins with confusion that takes too long to figure out what's going on. Good concept, good premise, good acting, but not a professionally written film at all! The ending is weird and also left unexplained. One viewer remarked of what an incredible ending. I simply don't understand where that review came from. The ending was much like the rest of the film, sketchy and poorly written. I like the film overall. I can't exactly say I wasted my money, yet I also can't say it was worth it either. In addition to the poorly written story, this film also lacks raw emotion. Beacham tried hard to insert this into his character , however the script just didn't make room for it. I'd love to see this film redone with a better script and a little different casting. All in all, I'd say it's worth watching, but there are far better films you can purchase than this one. If you are a diehard fan of TLA films, you probably won't mind so much, it's a pretty typical run of the mill TLA, but certainly not one of their best.",1303948800,2,2672,4.5

Unfortunately, we have :(
Both with the director and some actors.
Unfortunately, this time is like the time before: boring, not meeting expectations, amateurish.

It took me 45 minutes to watch this ""masterpice"". Lot of bla bla bla, little action and bad acting. Some people shouldn't be allowed to play at all.

The last thing that shocked me was the fact that this crap received any kind of award. The gay cinema must be really in a bad shape if accolades are given to such a dreadful movie.

3140050,3,B00153CLNK,This movie was interesting in how it trys to bring a twist to a gay theme. The story tried to weave a bit of Twighlight Zone plot into it but I felt the acting was a bit weak. The gay characters in this were uninteresting (not so much the two lead guys) and stereotypical. I do like the fact that an effort was made to be a little different with the plot so on that alone I feel this would be worth checking out but do not expect a whole lot.,1265760000,,442,3.868131868131868

3140052,3,B00153CLNK,"It seems that nearly all of the independent, low-budget, gay-romance films I've seen have the same problems: technical limitations, some questionable scripting/acting and a general lack of polish.  ""Back Soon"" is no exception... but like the others, it has a big ol' heart that keeps the film pumping and an integrity that I liked.

Unlike the others, however, it also relies on a bit of the supernatural for its main plot premise.  The big question the film raises is this: Is true love also blind and never-ending?

""Back Soon"" says it most certainly is.  I won't give away too much of the story, but there is a big, obvious supernatural reason that straight boys Logan (Windham Beacham) and Gil (Matthew Montgomery) are brought together.  And my favorite parts of the film are when they are examining this paradox.  There's a sensitivity and rawness that struck me as original, fresh and surprisingly real.  Montgomery's gruff, deep performance adds a lot to this dynamic; he carries the film.

The stumbling points of the film are all attributable to the relatively cheap budget and ridiculous supporting characters, from the nosy realtor, to the screaming-queen best pal, to the beyond-stereotyped gang-banga, to the ultra-perfect-but-dead wife, to the unbelievably (as in JUST. NOT. BELIEVABLE.) bigoted brother-in-law.  Every time one of these two-dimensional losers graced the screen I couldn't wait for them to get back to the main characters.

At its core, ""Back Soon"" is a bit talky, and there are way too many moments of Logan staring off pensively into the distance.  That said, I did love the goofy auditions-on-tape (Logan is an actor by trade) and ""Trixie's Revenge"", the incredibly bad movie-within-a-movie... it's a less than subtle reminder of how low a film like this could sink and doesn't.

Overall, the premise of this film saves it for me.  I love the big questions it gently tackles enough to forgive it its shortcomings.",1248307200,3,1946,5.059561128526646

3140054,4,B00153CLNK,"Does love end with death?

When we first meet Logan Foster, he is in a hospital anxiously waiting for a doctor to come out and tell him how his life is about to change.  The next time we see him he is in his living room packing away all the things that made the house a home.  He's selling it, he can no longer live in the house without his beloved wife ""too many ghosts"" as he explains.

It's been a year since his wife died; everyone is telling him it's time to move on, to get past it.  But how do you get past losing the only person you have ever loved, or will ever love?  How do you just one day say goodbye and let that be the end.  On the first day of the open house Logan is mistaken for the real-estate agent by a potential buyer Guillermo ""everybody just calls me Gill"" Ramirez.  Logan gives him a tour of the house and is compelled to sell him the house.  Not because of anything other than a gut feeling he's following.  He heart has over ruled his head.

That should be the end of it but something strange happens.  Logan and Gill strike up an unlikely friendship.  Even though these are two men from vastly different backgrounds; Logan is a struggling actor with a few bad indie movie credits and Gill as we come to find out is an ex-drug dealer.  One night they become closer than they ever dared imagine possible.  Especially since both men are straight.

No this isn't a film about repressed men figuring out who they really are and finding away to live with it and setting themselves and each other free.  We've all seen that story before.  As Gill tells his friend Jamie after first sleeping with Logan ""this is something new.""  These are two straight men, who fall deeply in love with one another but who are not attracted to other men only each other.

As the film develops we find out how it can be that these two men can be in love with each other.  We find out that love has no limits, not even death.  And we find out the nature of loss, and what unconditional love can be.",1229385600,6,1999,4.191601049868766
3140055,2,B00153CLNK,"Being gay, I always want to like gay movies. And I probably rate higher on a gay movie on its straight counterpart. So I was thinking I should give this one a 3-star just for the effort. Somehow I just couldn't bring myself to it.

You read my review title, so you know how I feel about the movie. At times I felt I couldn't decide whether the director meant for it to be funny, or it's just so bad that it's becoming funny. One advice for the director: Take a lesson from Jonah Markowitz, the director of ""Shelter"",  a movie that in my opinion is everything how a gay movie should be.",1223251200,6,585,4.168141592920354

3140058,3,B00153CLNK,"Since I liked ""Long-term Relationship"" so much, I bought ""Back Soon"" because I knew it has the same cast and director. I am very glad I did.

This movie has some compelling acting performances and some very original and interesting plot lines. Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham once again sizzle together on screen and Maggie Eilertson as Beacham's dead wife does a marvelous job in her role. As independent films go, this one is excellent, add in the gay romance and this one enters my top twenty favorite indie films of all times.

(I don't want to give away the plot, but think ""Ghost"" meets ""Return to Me"" and somwhere in-between you get ""Back Soon."")",1218499200,2,660,4.730434782608696
3140059,4,B00153CLNK,"I hesitated over seeing this film, even though I loved LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP, by the same filmmaker and leads.  The cover art is unattractive and the plot seemed without nuance, as you know already what's going on without having seen the film.  In fact, the first scene of the movie gives it away.

Now, having seen the film and liked it enough to want it in my collection, I can say the cover art is still bad.  And I would suggest the third lead, the female actor, should be the figure looming over the two lead males.

I like the leads, both good actors, and I'm sure their contrasting physical appeal will have the audience member favoring one or the other - Montgomery is very angular, sharp-featured, while Beacham is lush, and has a more timeless appeal.  There are a few kisses, but nothing more overt in any male-to-male physical interaction on-screen.

The plot has to do with how two straight guys find themselves in love with each other, and how they deal with that.  The conclusion to the film will be a surprise.

There are a couple of bad missteps from the filmmaker:  for one, there was no mystery, hence no surprise, as to the motifications behind the brother-in-law's behavior, and it seemed the performance by the actor should have been reined in, as well.  Some of the smaller roles are well-filled, but there are bad dialogue scenes.  Overall, the screenplay needed some finetuning, mainly to eliminate so much of the stereotyping of both male and female.  The screenplay, at times, is unintentionally laughable, and not in a good way, more in a ""this is camp"" way.  When there is too much of that, fortunately the performances of the two leads - both separately and together - saves the day.

The worst bit, merely because it's so inappropriate, is when one character ends up brandishing a gun.  I won't go into details, but for some reason the actor points the weapon like the short-lived Hollywood fantasy of gun-slinging that involved shooting sideways.  It was short-lived, because it was laughed at by virtually anyone who's ever handled a gun.  If you hold a gun the way the character did in this film, basically you could be three steps from a barn and still miss it.  So that was a big unintentional eye-popping laughfest during an otherwise tense scene, so the diector blew the big one, so to speak.

The director has interesting ideas - his LTR was great in exploring an aspect of being in love I can't recall another filmmaker delving into - but doesn't do some of the basic practical work behind the scenes to ensure a great product before he starts pointing his camera and saying ""Action.""  Hopefully he will have evolved by the time his third offering is set in motion.",1217808000,6,2706,4.666666666666667

None of the guys is as ugly as they look on the cover of the DVD, but that doesn't mean they are hot. It had very good ideas, but it was all spoiled with low budget settings, effects and truly poor acting from most of the actors. Watching it was like watching a movie made about an Alternate Universe fanfic of whatever book or series or movies out there written by a thirteen yearl-old girly who has no idea of actual life, real writing skills or love and relationships for that matter.

Two straight males one of them recovering from the death of his wife meet and form a friendship when Logan the widower puts his house up for sale.

The first and only person to look at the house is Gill.

He thinks Logan is the real estate agent and asks him for a tour of the house.

After the tour Gill is compelled to buy the house.

It is only after the deal closes that he realizes Logan was the former owner.

The two men are drawn to each other and form a friendship that evolves into much more.

This seems to be aided by Logan's dead wife making ghostly visits to both men, she seems to know this was destined to happen and is encouraging it.

Both are confused by this since neither one of them is gay however they work through their confusion and decide to defy convention and admit their love for each other.

They are wise enough to realize that love is a rare and special gift and when it is offered you take the package with out worrying  about how the package is wrapped.",1214179200,38,1076,4.179611650485437

Unfortunately, she was involved in a fatal auto accident and never returned.  It looked to the couple's friends that Logan would never recover from that shock, and they weren't surprised when he decided to sell the couple's dream house, since it held far too many memories.

The first morning the house is being shown, Gil (Matthew Montgomery) is the first potential buyer, and immediately feels a ""connection,"" not just with the house but also with Logan.  That connection develops into a close friendship in a very short time, and takes a step beyond that one night, when a sleepwalking Logan enters Gil's bed and these two ""straight"" young men have sex.  This is a surprise to both of them, since they were never attracted to other men before, but it somehow felt right, as do the feelings they have for each other.  In time, the possible cause of those feelings surfaces.

This isn't your typical gay romance, and only some minor characters identify as gay.  While done on a tiny budget (and it shows), from a screenplay with more than its share of trite, cheesy lines, and featuring acting (with the exception of the two lead actors named, who made it almost believable) that would be laughed off a high school stage, the story is at least original in its approach to explore the dynamics of attraction and love, with a ""Twilight Zone""-ish twist that is both thought-provoking as well as slightly cringe-inducing.  Reviews are all over the scales on this, since it isn't everyone's cup of tea.  Gay fans of fate and the supernatural may like it more.

3374536,3,B00153CLNK,"This movie cries out for ""bigger"" treatment, with bigger stars (for example, to think really ambitiously, the likes of James Franco with Andrew Garfield, but hopefully featuring the same leading actress, who has a lot of potential for something larger in scope), with a bigger budget, and suggesting bigger horizons. The premise that two persons, in simultaneous near-death experiences, share a bond when one (a man) revives, though the other (a woman) dies, and the surviving male inherits the love of the woman for her erstwhile husband (with many other things in common with the deceased wife) could make a great sci-fi/fantasy motion picture for Hollywood, or, given the sexual angle, an independent studio of means sufficient to make of such a project a grander work, with more vivid and eerie suggestions of the paranormal, than ""Back Soon"" ever could be and could do on such limited production means.

This film nonetheless was made, obviously on a budget too modest to realise fully enough such an ambitious concept, but it still is an interesting one to view. The men of the cast, while lacking glamour as much as more dramatic flair, are reasonably easy on the eyes, although their respective talents are insufficient to draw out to the maximum what is inherent in the scenario.

3374539,4,B00153CLNK,"You just don't find ambiguity is most American films.  Period.  And, as we see from some other reviews, here and elsewhere, there are lots of folks who really don't like ambiguity.  I can't say, of course, what Rob Williams was ultimately up to here, but, for my part, I found the whole development believable, touching, and, in one scene at least, profoundly moving.  I've lived too long and seen too many a hitherto straight-identified guy suddenly in a love (or sexual) relationship with another straight dude or (more usually) a gay guy, so THAT didn't bother me.  The whole ghost thing (and Maggie Eilertson is wonderful) is handled in a distinctly Jamesian way.  Think TURN OF THE SCREW.  Or the really unnerving THE INNOCENTS with the great and glorious Deborah Kerr from '61.  Is it all real?  Is what we're seeing some kind of psychological projection? Is Logan so drove up he's got to find a succubus to urge him on to Gil? As to the unlikely mixture of Gil's character and Logan's, while another reviewer said it's unbelievable, again, I disagree.  Gil even addresses that issue.

Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham are both, in my opinion, fine actors.  Of a distinctly modern sort, to be sure, but both possess the extraordinary gift of being able to span the gulf between the crazy world of making a film, and our seeing a product that captivates, charms, makes us laugh, or cry.  And that ain't no shabby gift!  I've seen both actors in rather more than a few other films.  Montgomery, who I think is extraordinarily good looking, with a peculiarly testosterone-saturated charisma, I find very attractive indeed.  He's also got one of the most mobile and expressive faces I've ever seen in recent years, able to convey some seriously subtle emotions and riffs going through his head.  Beacham also plays his disparate reactions in such a way that both visibly and audibly you do feel fairly sure you know what's going through his head, too.  What's fascinating is that both men are gay and out and proud, and the ""straight"" characters they create are, as I say, believable and strikingly different:  Gil is clearly the more mature, experienced man to the gawky, somewhat spoiled, and bewildered Logan.

I feel more sorry than otherwise for Artie O'Daly, because while I really liked him in LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP, here he's got, well, let's just say an ungrateful part to play. You'll know what I'm talking about when and if you see the film.  On the other hand, may God be thanked for having given us Kelly Keaton.  One of these days, I'll just betcha, that kid's going to pull a Kathy Bates and surprise the hell out of everyone but me!

Finally, I like Rob Williams' films.  I think he's a really fine director.  However, I do rather think it wouldn't hurt if he got and shared a bit of credit with a more canny and crafty writer.

No spoilers.  But the faults are none of them major, and I heartily recommend this quite original, indeed unique film. . . .",1335052800,7,2978,4.687861271676301

So the dude is going about minding his own business, when he sees a house for sale and he feels drawn to the house. He meets the owner of the house who is a man who had just lost his wife and he is immediately attracted to the man. To make a long story short the man's wife merged with the other guy and was just returning to her life. So the men form a sort of relationship and things are looking good, until the dude is in another accident and loses the wife's spirit.

Following the untimely death of his wife, Logan is selling their dream home which contains way too many memories. It just so happens that the buyer is the same drunk driver who killed Logans wife Adrianne, who seems to be hellbent as a ghost to put these two men together in a relationship, although both of them are straight. I liked this film, yet at the same time I'm a tad confused as to what this movie is really all about. The concept is pretty neat and original, however the story line lacks delivery big time! It's as if the writer is totally burnt out and didn't care about any attention to detail. There are too many vague areas that need answering. The acting of Windham Beacham is excellent and he was very well cast in this film. His character is refreshing but would shine much more with a well written plot. The ""straightness"" of the two characters who just somehow end up in bed together, is very unbelievable. Matthew Montgomery done a fine acting job, but frankly I didn't feel he was well cast here. Too much contrast between he and Beacham, and not very believable that the two could possibly have anything in common or form any kind of connection. Montgomery's lines especially were very scathe and ill written. I loved the house, the backdrops were mostly all perfect. The hospital scenes were lousy, unrealistic, had a very ameteur overtone that stunk. The friendship of Logan and his brother in law Spencer could have had more background given to it as could the love between Logan and Adrianne. The story begins really too far into the plot, and begins with confusion that takes too long to figure out what's going on. Good concept, good premise, good acting, but not a professionally written film at all! The ending is weird and also left unexplained. One viewer remarked of what an incredible ending. I simply don't understand where that review came from. The ending was much like the rest of the film, sketchy and poorly written. I like the film overall. I can't exactly say I wasted my money, yet I also can't say it was worth it either. In addition to the poorly written story, this film also lacks raw emotion. Beacham tried hard to insert this into his character , however the script just didn't make room for it. I'd love to see this film redone with a better script and a little different casting. All in all, I'd say it's worth watching, but there are far better films you can purchase than this one. If you are a diehard fan of TLA films, you probably won't mind so much, it's a pretty typical run of the mill TLA, but certainly not one of their best.",1303948800,2,2672,4.5

3374549,3,B00153CLNK,"It seems that nearly all of the independent, low-budget, gay-romance films I've seen have the same problems: technical limitations, some questionable scripting/acting and a general lack of polish.  ""Back Soon"" is no exception... but like the others, it has a big ol' heart that keeps the film pumping and an integrity that I liked.

Unlike the others, however, it also relies on a bit of the supernatural for its main plot premise.  The big question the film raises is this: Is true love also blind and never-ending?

""Back Soon"" says it most certainly is.  I won't give away too much of the story, but there is a big, obvious supernatural reason that straight boys Logan (Windham Beacham) and Gil (Matthew Montgomery) are brought together.  And my favorite parts of the film are when they are examining this paradox.  There's a sensitivity and rawness that struck me as original, fresh and surprisingly real.  Montgomery's gruff, deep performance adds a lot to this dynamic; he carries the film.

The stumbling points of the film are all attributable to the relatively cheap budget and ridiculous supporting characters, from the nosy realtor, to the screaming-queen best pal, to the beyond-stereotyped gang-banga, to the ultra-perfect-but-dead wife, to the unbelievably (as in JUST. NOT. BELIEVABLE.) bigoted brother-in-law.  Every time one of these two-dimensional losers graced the screen I couldn't wait for them to get back to the main characters.

At its core, ""Back Soon"" is a bit talky, and there are way too many moments of Logan staring off pensively into the distance.  That said, I did love the goofy auditions-on-tape (Logan is an actor by trade) and ""Trixie's Revenge"", the incredibly bad movie-within-a-movie... it's a less than subtle reminder of how low a film like this could sink and doesn't.

When we first meet Logan Foster, he is in a hospital anxiously waiting for a doctor to come out and tell him how his life is about to change.  The next time we see him he is in his living room packing away all the things that made the house a home.  He's selling it, he can no longer live in the house without his beloved wife ""too many ghosts"" as he explains.

It's been a year since his wife died; everyone is telling him it's time to move on, to get past it.  But how do you get past losing the only person you have ever loved, or will ever love?  How do you just one day say goodbye and let that be the end.  On the first day of the open house Logan is mistaken for the real-estate agent by a potential buyer Guillermo ""everybody just calls me Gill"" Ramirez.  Logan gives him a tour of the house and is compelled to sell him the house.  Not because of anything other than a gut feeling he's following.  He heart has over ruled his head.

That should be the end of it but something strange happens.  Logan and Gill strike up an unlikely friendship.  Even though these are two men from vastly different backgrounds; Logan is a struggling actor with a few bad indie movie credits and Gill as we come to find out is an ex-drug dealer.  One night they become closer than they ever dared imagine possible.  Especially since both men are straight.

No this isn't a film about repressed men figuring out who they really are and finding away to live with it and setting themselves and each other free.  We've all seen that story before.  As Gill tells his friend Jamie after first sleeping with Logan ""this is something new.""  These are two straight men, who fall deeply in love with one another but who are not attracted to other men only each other.

As the film develops we find out how it can be that these two men can be in love with each other.  We find out that love has no limits, not even death.  And we find out the nature of loss, and what unconditional love can be.",1229385600,6,1999,4.191601049868766

3374556,4,B00153CLNK,"I hesitated over seeing this film, even though I loved LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP, by the same filmmaker and leads.  The cover art is unattractive and the plot seemed without nuance, as you know already what's going on without having seen the film.  In fact, the first scene of the movie gives it away.

Now, having seen the film and liked it enough to want it in my collection, I can say the cover art is still bad.  And I would suggest the third lead, the female actor, should be the figure looming over the two lead males.

I like the leads, both good actors, and I'm sure their contrasting physical appeal will have the audience member favoring one or the other - Montgomery is very angular, sharp-featured, while Beacham is lush, and has a more timeless appeal.  There are a few kisses, but nothing more overt in any male-to-male physical interaction on-screen.

The plot has to do with how two straight guys find themselves in love with each other, and how they deal with that.  The conclusion to the film will be a surprise.

There are a couple of bad missteps from the filmmaker:  for one, there was no mystery, hence no surprise, as to the motifications behind the brother-in-law's behavior, and it seemed the performance by the actor should have been reined in, as well.  Some of the smaller roles are well-filled, but there are bad dialogue scenes.  Overall, the screenplay needed some finetuning, mainly to eliminate so much of the stereotyping of both male and female.  The screenplay, at times, is unintentionally laughable, and not in a good way, more in a ""this is camp"" way.  When there is too much of that, fortunately the performances of the two leads - both separately and together - saves the day.

The worst bit, merely because it's so inappropriate, is when one character ends up brandishing a gun.  I won't go into details, but for some reason the actor points the weapon like the short-lived Hollywood fantasy of gun-slinging that involved shooting sideways.  It was short-lived, because it was laughed at by virtually anyone who's ever handled a gun.  If you hold a gun the way the character did in this film, basically you could be three steps from a barn and still miss it.  So that was a big unintentional eye-popping laughfest during an otherwise tense scene, so the diector blew the big one, so to speak.

The director has interesting ideas - his LTR was great in exploring an aspect of being in love I can't recall another filmmaker delving into - but doesn't do some of the basic practical work behind the scenes to ensure a great product before he starts pointing his camera and saying ""Action.""  Hopefully he will have evolved by the time his third offering is set in motion.",1217808000,6,2706,4.666666666666667

He thinks Logan is the real estate agent and asks him for a tour of the house.

Unfortunately, she was involved in a fatal auto accident and never returned.  It looked to the couple's friends that Logan would never recover from that shock, and they weren't surprised when he decided to sell the couple's dream house, since it held far too many memories.

The first morning the house is being shown, Gil (Matthew Montgomery) is the first potential buyer, and immediately feels a ""connection,"" not just with the house but also with Logan.  That connection develops into a close friendship in a very short time, and takes a step beyond that one night, when a sleepwalking Logan enters Gil's bed and these two ""straight"" young men have sex.  This is a surprise to both of them, since they were never attracted to other men before, but it somehow felt right, as do the feelings they have for each other.  In time, the possible cause of those feelings surfaces.

This isn't your typical gay romance, and only some minor characters identify as gay.  While done on a tiny budget (and it shows), from a screenplay with more than its share of trite, cheesy lines, and featuring acting (with the exception of the two lead actors named, who made it almost believable) that would be laughed off a high school stage, the story is at least original in its approach to explore the dynamics of attraction and love, with a ""Twilight Zone""-ish twist that is both thought-provoking as well as slightly cringe-inducing.

8257266,5,B00153CLNK,Love the story and Matthew Montgomery is great.  I've enjoyed all films from Guest House Films. There is always a wonderful gay theme,1438560000,,133,4.782608695652174
8257267,5,B00153CLNK,"Not since ""Ghosts"" have I seen such a film that raps the audience in an emotional cocoon of unparalleled circumstances.  I had originally viewed this flix and was really impressed by the interaction between these two men.  What is so remarkable about the subject, which was no doubt metaphysical, is that this could be actual reality. TIME AND SPACE IS NO BARRIER TO LOVE, ESPECIALLY TRUE LOVE!!  NJMJr!!
PS I have viewed this film over ten times.  I get so emotionally involved that I lose track of real time!  Words do not adequately describe the feelings that I have for the characters especially in their situation.  There is such an aurora of ethereal presence, yet no specific point in time!  LOVE IS STRANGE!  NJMJr!",1435536000,,723,4.774193548387097
8257268,5,B00153CLNK,Montgomery and Beacham two of my favorite gay actors in the movie industry....great story...fast delivery,1434240000,,105,6.066666666666666
8257269,5,B00153CLNK,"I can't say anything about this movie was fantastic except the story which carries everything along on a wave that rises and falls naturally as you watch. Picture and sound quality, acting, soundtrack...everything was just OK, but I loved it anyway. Not even any skin or sex. It's simply a unique  and touching story that was great to watch. If this ever got done in big budget hollywoodland, it would be huge.",1432166400,,410,4.694444444444445
