8245143,3,B0012DP4EQ,"I purchased this dvd to use as a visual reference for figurative painting.

It was about what I expected. Obviously not shot on the highest of budgets, and a little awkward to use (you have to take a screenshot to get a specific angle on the poses). The models were not bad, but the fake breasts on a couple of them make them well-nigh useless for my painting, without my having to alter their figures in the drawing stage. The classical musc in the background as the models go through the rotation is nice, too.

The DVD kept jamming in my disc drive; I finally figured out that it was the paper label on the top of the disc that was causing it to jam up. I spent about 20 minutes getting the glue off of the disc after I peeled off the sticker, and now it runs just fine.

Most of the poses were standard glam. A couple of the standing poses resemble classic positions enough to be useful to me. All of the poses were standing.

If you're looking for a reference disc, invest in one of the ""Art Models"" or ""Virtual Pose"" books; all of them except Art Models 1 include a disc with full turnarounds of every pose; the Art Models books generally contain extra angles as well (from above, ground level, etc.)",1350691200,2,1206,4.299559471365638

8245145,5,B0012DP4EQ,"It is not always easy to come up with poses that are both creative and tasteful when photographing or painting artistic nudes. Yet thanks to this beautifully shot DVD there a tool that offers hope as well as tons of creative posing ideas.

From filming the nude female models on a turntable like setup to offer a very useful 360 degree view of each pose to that vast range of poses shown on the DVD without question ""The Ultimate Nude Posing Guide"" really is the ultimate tool for both artist & photographers looking to add a few tastefully done nudes to their portfolio. Yet find themselves drawing a blank when it comes to how they should pose their subject.",1334016000,,660,4.546218487394958
