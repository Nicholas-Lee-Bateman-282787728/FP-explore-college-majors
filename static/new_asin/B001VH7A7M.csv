8577456,5,B001VH7A7M,"Apparition is a work of inspiration about where your beliefs can take you.  The true testament of one's faith is seen through the various narratives at holy pilgrimage sights from Bosnia to India.  The narratives connected to the location are powerful and fascinating but more importantly they make the viewer ask questions about the power and possibilities of faith.  Connecting with the sacred sites encourages the viewer to explore the possibility that there are miracles all around us that bleed into our lives.  I should add that we don't usually identify them as miracles but rather label them anomalies, strange occurrences, or otherworldly.  For example how did Chilean miners survive, or how does a woman g birth octoplets.  Science/logic can take us only so far and then we rely on belief.  What Ms. Smith does so well is share specific apparitions in a way that allows us to assign a personal value to them The movie is really a jumping off point, it encourages the viewer to ask questions that are part of all of our daily lives like: how do we survive cancer, find love, celebrate spiritual renewal when our lives are filled with stress?  The filmmaker doesn't provide answers but she brings the audience to a place where you ask critical questions.  That's an impressive accomplishment in a world that whip saws us from one extreme drama to the another leaving little time or space to think about anything meaningful. Simply said Apparition took me away from the chaos of life long enough so that I was able to appreciate its gifts.",1289433600,,1546,4.825757575757576
8577457,5,B001VH7A7M,"Maura Smith has created a beautiful reminder that Mary's love for each of us always leads us to her Son. Begining in India and ending in Mexico, Maura and her camera takes us to places that have great devotion to the Blessed Mother, seemingly crossing religious boundaries. Visionaries, scholars, historians, theologians and those who have traveled to the shrines share their thoughts. Maura visited, Bosnia England, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Slovakia and Syria. One of the most moving accounts was of Iveta, who received visons as a teenager from Slovakia. She talks about how different praying is when you know the Blessed Mother and her Son are really listening. Iveta is inspiring and radiates joy. A great gift for Christmas or any other time.",1258416000,2,761,5.096
