8127668,5,B000FZEN3A,"I bought this video for a friend of mine who served in Vietnam and has been having multiple and varied problems with his health that the doctors haven't been able to piece together.  He never stopped to think that these issues might have been related to the exposures to Agent Orange that he had during his service in Vietnam.  Previously hopeless, he now feels empowered to take control of his health and, in fact, his doctors are now taking a new approach to his symptoms and illnesses based on what he learned from this film.  I can't thank Mr. Scholl and his team enough for putting out this important documentary.  It has truly affected my friend's life as I'm sure it has for hundreds of other veterans in similar circumstances who are eternally indebted to you.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you!",1336003200,,809,4.590277777777778
8127669,5,B000FZEN3A,"Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops are stationed overseas, in harm's way each day.  As we see in today's wars, we are far from an era of tranquility, and those protecting this country risk their lives and the trajectories of their families in defending the nation and keeping us safe.  Their commitments don't miraculously happen and they haven't occurred just recently.  This documentary shows the sacrifices of our soldiers in a distant place and time, Vietnam, and how the consequences of decisions made by the government in that era continue to affect those who served and which have subjected their lives to such hardship and more.  This documentary, aside from its great technical quality and appeal to a viewer, in its stories gets to the heart of the problem: how do we cause harm to our enemies, without causing harm to ourselves?  It reveals the paradox by showing through these soldiers' lives how we have caused that lasting harm, and makes clear that however one thinks of the ultimate aims of a war, those who fight are not synonymous with those who decide.  Remember those who served, and on this D-Day anniversary approaching, it is even more appropriate.  A great service to veterans, and I highly recommend it; an example of civic service at its finest.",1244160000,2,1273,4.8657407407407405
8127670,5,B000FZEN3A,"This documentary is a very informative film for anyone who has family,or friends that have unfortunetly been exposed to Agent Orange. Many Americans are unaware of the damaging effects left on Veterans from the exposure to Agent Orange. In this film are two brave souls out of many Veterans who will share very emotional stories of vietnam,and how they are coping with life after Vietnam exposure to Agent Orange. For those who have not been effected directly through family or friends this film is an eye opener with helpful information on Agent Orange. Great Film.",1228176000,,566,4.968421052631579
8127671,5,B000FZEN3A,"Although this film should be an interest to any American citizen or human rights activist - it should be of particular interest to educators and those associated with veterans.  Really great film for students, vets or those who work with or have family in the military.

I'm not much for historical documentaries but this film had me hooked. It's message is fascinating and relevant to our current times as so many American troops are now over seas. The film does not take sides... just a profound look at an often disregarded topic - what happens to the solider after the war? Not just a few years later... but decades later.  Hear what these vets recall about their time serving our country, but also their current struggle as they suffer years and years later due to their contact with agent orange.

The film also assists in explaining what benefits are currently available to vets who came into contact with agent orange.  Worth a view - captivating!!!!",1226880000,2,958,4.781818181818182
8127672,4,B000FZEN3A,"For an independent filmmaker making his very first documentary it is indeed an amazing film. The film recounts the life of two Vietnam war veterans who are still coping with the after effects of Agent Orange.

There is a brief narration about Agent Orange and the various diseases it has caused to the people who served in Vietnam. For the most part you get to know first hand the 2 veterans who talk about their daily life and the struggles they have had to endure.

By the end of the film it will make you very emotional and you will feel as if you know the veterans intimately.

To that end the producers have achieved to create a film that is insightful and thoughtful.

This film can also serve as an educational film for those who are not aware of the after effects of Agent Orange.",1153699200,5,788,4.376712328767123
8127673,4,B000FZEN3A,"This informative film could very well be a life saver for our Veterans, yet what resonates with me is the vulnerable and respectful approach it exhibits in regards to the humanity and dignity of these veterans.  For instance, the film begins with a personal recounting of a humorous incident in Vietnam.  It does not distract from the subject, but instead it establishes a bond with the subjects of the documentary.

Technically, the sound and visuals show some polish.  I have seen independent films with distracting breaks and inconsistent sound levels - not the case here.  The narration is also clear and serves its purpose.  Most importantly, the message gets across without any hindrance from the technical side.

This film could have been many things, but what I found was a candid interview with two Vietnam Vets who recount their daily struggle with multiple diseases.  It takes a lot of grace to create a documentary about Agent Orange and the effects it has left on the American Veteran.  I find this film to be informative, helpful, and respectful.  This film does a great service to the Vietnam Vets dealing with the aftereffects of Agent Orange.",1151971200,5,1159,4.927835051546392
