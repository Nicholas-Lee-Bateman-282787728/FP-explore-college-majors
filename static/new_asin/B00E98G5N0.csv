5897836,5,B00E98G5N0,"Everyone knows this series is great so let's get to reviewing the actual product at hand. This is, indeed, the full original series with every episode, special features, and a bonus disk containing a making-of documentary. Since this set is so much less expensive than other box sets, I was wondering if it was the real deal and it is. It's great! It arrived quickly from the seller, too. You can't beat this DVD set. The whole original series for a low price.",1392422400,21,460,4.554216867469879
5897837,5,B00E98G5N0,I purchased this for a birthday gift for my son-in-law as a surprise.  He and my daughter love it and watch it all the time.,1391385600,5,124,3.96
5897838,5,B00E98G5N0,"Ignore the 1 star reviewer. They clearly either have not seen it or just don't understand the humor. The first three seasons of this series upped the bar for any future sitcoms! Perfect in every way. Season 4 on Netflix was good too, maybe not AS good as 1-3, but it was still nice seeing the characters back, and it definitely had it's moments. Hope season 4 gets a DVD release too (outlook on that is promising as I see ""House of Cards"" is getting a DVD).",1388620800,5,457,4.264367816091954
5897839,5,B00E98G5N0,"Even though this is simply a repackaging of the series that played on Fox, it is definitely worth every cent if you have not purchased the sets previously.  I have watched my sets over and over.  They never get old.  You even get to pick up on things that you may have missed the first few times through.  While not everyone has become endeared to this series, I find it to be the best series ever.  If I could only watch one show for the rest of my life, this would be the one.",1387065600,6,478,4.042553191489362
5897840,5,B00E98G5N0,"This is a great show, and to have the seasons on DVD is good for those who don't have netflix. The hype IS appropriate for this program, and it's won tons of critical acclaim. It's heartwarming and funny, and takes the viewer on a hilarious journey of family and what it means to be one.

Recommended for teens through old age. Everyone can get a laugh with this show, and you'll recognize a lot of familiar faces!",1386720000,8,414,4.376623376623376

5897847,5,B00E98G5N0,This show is so much fun! I just finished watching it from start to finish for the 3rd time. No matter what is going on in life this show always gives me a mental break and some big laughs. One of my top 5 favorite T.V. shows right along with The Andy Griffith Show.

5897852,5,B00E98G5N0,Great packaging for a full series set. Not too bulky or you could get rid of the outer casing entirely because each season has its own DVD case.,1446681600,,144,4.178571428571429
5897853,5,B00E98G5N0,"Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the one sane one trying to hold things together.  These first three seasons are the truly essential ones.  The much more recent 4th season revival lost a little something, at least for me.

Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to do a spin on a traditional sitcom.

The acting is terrific, from top to bottom. Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell did they ever get this on network TV? And thank god they did!""

On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they had to fill 30+ episodes. The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clever twists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness. And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top, but almost always successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character, and self-referential episodes like `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the history of television.",1441324800,2,1366,4.917391304347826

5897859,5,B00E98G5N0,"Simply put - this is one of my favorite shows (excluding the 4th season). Stories are very well written with witty dialogue, but not exactly sophisticated, and hysterical characters.",1398643200,3,182,5.310344827586207
