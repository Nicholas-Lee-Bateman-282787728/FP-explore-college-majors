2787245,5,B000NVKWZ4,"I cringed a little at the price of this set, but having watched the whole set at least once (and more) I am convinced of its value. It is a training class that you can review again and again whenever you hit a snag with your dog. The classes are conducted by Ian Dunbar, the father of non-force dog training. He is a pleasant person to watch, patient and good-humored, and the lessons really work. This set covers all the basic commands that every dog needs to learn, plus many common problem behaviors and how to correct them with reward-based positive training.

I expect to spend many hours watching these videos as I train my two pups.",1224979200,27,639,4.461538461538462
2787246,5,B000NVKWZ4,"Instead of using force (e.g. choke collars, hitting) to get dogs to behave in ways we find acceptable, Dr. Dunbar demonstrates that humans can use their intellect to make training fun. Brain over Brawn! His methods are very effective. Of course, positive reinforcement won't ALWAYS work even with the most diligent trainer, but neither will negative reinforcement. In the end, I'd rather have a partially-untrained dog who still likes me than a partially-untrained dog who is afraid of me! Although he does teach techniques, Dunbar's most important (implicit) message is that it wouldn't hurt to look at things from your dog's point of view.

P.S.: Ian Dunbar (PhD, BVetMed, MRCVS, CPDT) is a veterinarian, animal behaviorist, dog trainer, and writer. He is held in the highest regard by animal behaviorists worldwide.",1202601600,30,818,5.244274809160306
8182136,5,B000NVKWZ4,Great video. I also bought Dr. Dunbars Good Little Dog Book and use both together.,1522800000,,82,4.533333333333333
8182137,5,B000NVKWZ4,Really a retro Revolution in Dog Training. If you are getting a new Puppy and even with an older dog. This is well worth it.,1516233600,,124,4.0
8182138,4,B000NVKWZ4,"Very helpful.  If you are a visual learner, then these disks are excellent in showing the training skills.  I think the books provide more information and too are very helpful.",1457136000,,176,4.833333333333333
8182139,3,B000NVKWZ4,Ok.,1420761600,,3,3.0
8182140,3,B000NVKWZ4,"The fundamentals taught on these DVDs are important and wonderful; however, the authors other products convey (as best as I can remember at the moment) all the information in less expensive formats.  In my opinion, Dunbar excels at explaining puppy socialization.  A few months of fun, hard work, with your puppy with Dunbar's advice, can bring many YEARS of wonderful co-existence with the adult dog.  If you are a first time puppy owner, or a first time dog owner, Dunbar's products are magnificient - especially for prospective and current puppy owners though.

This set of DVDS is not impressively professional, but the information they contain is vital.

If you learn well by reading or audio, Dunbar gives the same information (I think) in less expensive formats.  If you really, really enjoy watching videos, then this set may be worth the price to you in order to learn in the video format.  These DVDs appear to have been made in the 1980s in conjunction with another TV show or other training sessions that have a difference purpose than being done primarily to produce these DVDs.",1356480000,7,1091,4.896739130434782
8182141,4,B000NVKWZ4,"Dr. Dunbar is so enjoyable to watch and his love of dogs is so evident.  His patience and creativity are inspiring . I watch the DVD repeatedly, each time picking up a new tidbit. For the cost, however, I wish there were MORE tidbits of specific information re: challenging puppy's behaviors.",1355875200,,292,4.7254901960784315
8182142,5,B000NVKWZ4,The four disc set is very informative and his teaching method is quite good. The discs are also entertaining enough to watch multiple times and that is what's required to learn a subject and implement it's methods into training your own dog. I would recommend this video to a friend.,1327968000,,283,4.68
8182143,5,B000NVKWZ4,"This video provides very specific information, instructions, and behavioral demonstrations in an easy to learn from format.  Next best thing to personal instruction.",1316908800,,165,6.173913043478261
8182144,3,B000NVKWZ4,"Well Dr. Dunbar has good advice but the tape was not quite what I expected for $100 price tag.  It was a video of an 8 week puppy class.  The videography did not seem professional.  It was set in England at a mansion.  At times the sound is poor.  The first 2 tapes were nothing new.  Second two tapes had a little more advanced info.  If you are a first time puppy owner, this is for you.  If like me, you were looking for more advanced info.  this is probably not the right video.",1314662400,4,482,4.042553191489362
8182145,5,B000NVKWZ4,"Our vet recommended a local Sirius Puppy Training trainer to help with some issues we had with an adopted adult dog, specifically restrictive lunging and barking at other dogs and people, and poor behavior with other animal distractions.  Doing some research first, we found that Dr. Dunbar is considered the founder of behaviorist dog training, and that he had this DVD set and the Training the Adult Dog DVD available.  All are dated, based on Dunbar's U.K. TV series and slightly later work in San Francisco, but the training is sound and worked very well for us.  What is particularly good is the Dunbar does not only deal with the basics of training, but also demonstrates very practical solutions to solving many common behavior problems such as shyness, aggressive behavior on leash, leash pulling, and resistance to recall.  It is precisely those nuggets that we appreciated the most.  Dunbar's dry sense of humor and calm, understated approach makes training a real pleasure.",1313625600,5,984,5.049382716049383
