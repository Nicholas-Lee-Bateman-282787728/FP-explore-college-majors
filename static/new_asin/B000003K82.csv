1180978,5,B000003K82,"This ranks as one of my all time favorite Star Trek episodes.  It is one of those rare ones which set aside adventure and special effects in favor of focusing on relationships and emotions.
Right from the start one can tell that this episode is different.  Instead of the typical DS9 environment, one is shown a Louisiana swamp on a dark and stormy night.  A young writer is making her way through the swamp to find the home of her favorite writer, Jake Sisko.  It is through her interview of Jake that one of the most heartwrenching stories I have ever heard is told.
A freak accident on some mission traps Ben Sisko is a time trap.  He experiences no passage of time, but the world he had once lived in continues on.  This is very hard on his son Jake.  Eventually Jake realizes that every few years, his father will appear in the real world.  So as Jake grows up, publishes, and starts a family, he gets to visit with his father for only a few short minutes every few years.  Finally, Jake discovers that there is a way to bring his father back into life, and so he devotes his whole life to making that happen.  That quest of his forces him to sacrifice everything.  Sisko sees the result of that every few years and begs Jake not to waste his life for his sake.  The emotional pull is heartbreaking.
This is a very well done episode.  The build-up and passage of years makes the relationship between father and son very emotional.  I cried and appreciated Star Trek for making such a drama.",1002153600,3,1495,4.389090909090909
1180979,5,B000003K82,"If you are ever having trouble finding a gift for a Star Trek fan, buy them this episode!  THE VISITOR is probably the best hour of television ever produced by the Star Trek franchise.  My wife, who does not like Star Trek, was moved to tears.
Amazingly, there are no epic battles, no dazzling special effects, no mega guest appearances, and I am sure the budget was small.  However, the story is very rich, the acting is superb, and the music is a wealth of emotions. Tony Todd should have won an Emmy for his portrayal of a growing man who misses his father, and will sacrifice everything to have a second chance at saving his father's life (To a non-Trekker the best comparison is the movie ""Field of Dreams"").
There have been some amazing stories told by Star Trek over the years, but to me this is the best.  If I could have only one episode to watch for the rest of my life, this would be it.",981331200,3,898,4.295857988165681
1180980,5,B000003K82,"This is a character study, but it is a wonderful character study.  Tony Todd stands out in his role as the aging Jake Sisko.  It's rare for a  sci-fi show to pack this much emotional impact into an hour without an  alien battle in space, but this show manages it.  I would recommend it even  to people who didn't like Star Trek.",966384000,,328,4.209677419354839
1180981,5,B000003K82,"In episodes like these it's difficult to prevent the end result from appearing overly sentimental or even manipualtive.  Yet The Visitor is so heartfelt and believable that I couldn't help but be moved by the Siskos'  plight.  Even a slightly high amount of technobabble is not enough to  prevent this, along with Hard Time, from being the best from DS9's season  4.",962928000,,366,4.838709677419355
1180982,5,B000003K82,"Through three seasons, Deep Space Nine had struggled to find it's footing.  Season one was uneven and mostly uneventful.  Season two was, surprisingly, strong.  In season three, the producers and writers almost  dropped the ball -- it was a difficult year, to say the least.  With season  four, Deep Space Nine had found itself.
With the fourth season premiere,  ""The Way of the Warrior"", DS9 had re-introduced us to Worf and  dropped intriguing bombshell after bombshell into the faithful viewers'  collective laps.  DS9 fans were eagerly awaiting the season opener's  promise of Klingon politics and station intrigue.  Instead, without  warning, we get ""The Visitor"", an episode that strayed from the  interstellar war and galactic conflict that the premiere had hinted at.  We  weren't expecting ""The Visitor"" and had no idea that this episode  would not only become the most popular DS9 episode ever but one of the most  popular episodes of any Trek series.
""The Visitor"" gives us a  glimpse at an alternate future where Jake Sisko had lost his father to a  mishap right after the events of ""The Way of the Warrior"".  We  discover through an old Jake that his father wasn't dead but was  ""suspended out of time"", never aging, never dying yet forever  alone.  Jake, obsessed with rescuing his father, sacrifices his marriage,  his career as a successful writer and, ultimately, his very life all to  save his father, Ben Sisko.  This episode is powerful and tragic.  We  understand Jake's sacrifice but at what cost?  In the end, we see a lonely  old man, who could never move on, attempt to alter the past so he can be  with his dad again.
I challenge anyone to NOT cry at the ending.  This  episode is an emotional triumph, DS9's best indeed.",962236800,7,1747,4.826530612244898
1180983,5,B000003K82,"This episode is as fresh after multiple viewings as it was the first time  I saw it.  I was blown away when I first saw it.  Believe me, EVERY time I  see it, it moves me.  The performances were stunning all the way around.  It was not contrived, the emotion was not forced and, as someone else said,  this episode shows that Star Trek is about human relationships, not just  ships blowing each other up in space.  BRAVO!",959731200,,421,4.294871794871795
1180984,5,B000003K82,"This is my personal favorite of any Star Trek Episode I have ever seen.  I lost my father a year before watching The Visitor.  This episode has helped with the healing process.  An excellent story, magnificent acting, and  deeply touching.  If you have a spouse that hates Star Trek, show them this  one.  They'll be crying by the end (I'm tearing up just thinking about it).",955238400,7,375,4.590909090909091
1180985,5,B000003K82,"There are few Trek episodes that can move one to tears, but this is certainly one of them.  This is what sci-fi is all about, and what every sci-fi piece of entertainment should aspire to be.  Well done.  I can't  wait to get this on video.  It will be the first Trek video I ever buy.",944006400,5,285,4.017857142857143
1180986,5,B000003K82,"This episode from the early fourth season was the most moving and heart-rending episode perhaps ever done for any Star Trek series.  Outstanding performances all around by Avery Brooks, Cirroc Lofton and Tony  Todd as the elder Jake Sisko. There are very few trek episodes I will buy  for posterity through the years but this will be one of them, when they  finally release it on video.",941328000,9,386,4.7164179104477615

7903130,5,B000003K82,"I am the type of person that never cries, but tears streamed from my face multiple times during this episode. The bond between a father and a son, is perhaps the strongest bond that this world knows. Unfortunately, modern society has diminished the role of fathers in general, and portrayed us as imbeciles and idiots in the media. Thus our children and women have no respect for the male bond with his children. This episode will not touch anyone of a modern mind. But to anyone who understands the worth of a father, a good father, this episode will tug at your heart strings. This is not only the best episode of Star trek ds9, but the best episode in all star trek history.",1346457600,4,677,4.467741935483871
7903131,5,B000003K82,"It is difficult to think of a finer example of late 20th century drama. It ranks alongside the work of Spielberg or Stephen King or even Hitchcock at their peak. The premise is Shakespeareian in its simplicity. The performance uses techniques rarely seen outside of theater. Rachel Robinson as explicands. The elevation of musical score to the level of narrative. The passage of time invoking the literary theme of saga. Watching the performances of Tony Todd and Avery Brooks, one is reminded of Paul Robeson.",1198627200,3,510,5.011764705882353
7903132,5,B000003K82,"This episode clearly marked DS9 as the best,if not equel to TNG by conveying emotions between characters instead of much appreciated action. Never has an episode of Star Trek dealt so realisticly with its characters that it excels as one of the series finest moments. From the stormy beginning to the emotional finale this is Star Trek acting and directing at its best. If you don't like DS9, then this probably won't change your mind about the show due to its character driven plot but for any DS9 fan this is an episode not to miss.",1047254400,4,534,4.572916666666667
7903133,5,B000003K82,"""The Visitor"", from DS9's fourth season, remains a fan and critical favorite.  Like the best of Trek, this particular installment is more dependent on character development than special effects or other technical wizardry.
The acting by all is first-rate.  Tony Todd (of ""Candyman"" fame and an earlier role as Worf's brother) turns in a fine performance as the elder Jake Sisko, enduring a lifelong quest to rescue his father from subspace limbo.  Cast member Cirroc Lofton gets one of his few chances to shine as the young Jake.  Guest star Rachel Robinson is quite good as a young woman that visits Jake in the winter of his years.  Last but not least, star Avery Brooks brings his usual dynamic strength to the role of Benjamin Sisko as he pops in and out at stages of his son's life.
The respective scenes featuring exchanges between Brooks, Todd, and Lofton are endearing and memorable.
Besides being well written and acted, the episode features one of the best scores of any Trek show.  It is no wonder that composer Dennis McCarthy's music is featured on a ""Best of Trek"" compilation album.  The music is a combination of subtlety, poetry, and foreboding as it represents the strong bond between father and son.
""The Visitor"" is an example of true quality television and deserves a place in the TV Hall of Fame.",1046563200,2,1318,4.779735682819383
7903134,5,B000003K82,"Unusual, unique, and very satisfying this episode was a perfect follow-up to the intense fourth season opener 'The Way Of The Warrior'.  Alternately poignant, sad, profound and tragic this is one of the most offbeat and daring shows written for any of the Trek series.  In a genre that tends to adhere strictly to action, adventure, heroism and occasionally romance 'The Visitor' steps aside from all of these and creates an unforgettable story of a father and son bond.
Jake Sisko, now an elderly gentleman, is alone in his house somewhere in the Louisiana Bayou country and is surprised to hear someone knocking on his door.  He lets in a soaked and shivering young woman from the rainstorm outside; she has a slight wound to her forehead that he tends to and he offers her a chair by the fire to warm herself.  She quickly confesses to him that she did not just happen along but that she had every intention of meeting him as she wants to be a writer also.  She praises him for his few books that he has written and asks him why he stopped writing so long ago.  He shares a personal and touching story with her about his father's death when he was 18, an event that has haunted him all his life, eventually absorbing him and emotionally crippling him we observe.  Jake altered his career choices without much forethought and at great cost to him and others he was very close to.
Fascinating, compelling and often quite moving 'The Visitor' gets your attention immediately and doesn't let up at all.  As Jake tells the story we become completely engrossed by the details as well as the images onscreen; the accident onboard the Defiant that took his father's life; the funereal at DS9; Jake's sympathetic pleading with Kira to remain aboard the station when it is likely that soon it will be turned over to other authorities; his father's sporadic and puzzling reappearances to him throughout his life and the anguish he experiences because of it.  These and many other similar scenes really strike at the emotional center of the viewer as very few episodes of Trek ever have.  The final scene between Jake and his father with Jake explaining his choice and sacrifice should cause tears to well up in even the most stubborn of us.  The production team put forth an incredible effort, as you'll note throughout your viewing - the appropriate non-traditional music score and the use of light and shadow to accentuate the current moods of the characters.  Everyone featured turns in a meaningful and excellent performance, most especially Tony Todd as the elder Jake.  One of the most memorable scenes for me is when Kira approaches Jake to suggest he leave DS9; this significant moment is handled both touchingly and cheerlessly without being gloomy.  The powerful story is balanced with a little bit of scattered humor and some interesting 'growth development' for some of the DS9 regulars.  Nog is featured in the story as a Federation officer who assists his old friend Jake; Dax and Bashir are also featured as an aged pair helping to recreate the accident that took their friend and former captain Benjamin Sisko's life; the names of Quark, Rom and Morn are also name-dropped along with amusing updates.  This is one of the series very best episodes and only the coldest of hearts could not appreciate its warmth, sensitivity and upbeat message.
Some additional notes: Tony Todd, arguably Trek's most versatile actor, has appeared as Worf's brother Kurn in the ST: TNG episodes 'Sins Of The Father' and the two-part 'Redemption' and still later on ST: DS9's 'Sons Of Mogh'; he was cast as the Alpha Hirogen in the Voyager episode 'Prey'.  Rachel Robinson, who appears as Melanie, is the daughter of DS9 regular Andrew Robinson (Garak).",1043798400,2,3740,4.8006230529595015
7903135,4,B000003K82,"Episode title: The Visitor
Written by: Michael Piller
Directed by: David Livingston
A retarted writer, Jake Sisko, gets a visitor to his home on Earth.
He desides to tell to that visitor a story of his life never told, a story that has hunted him throughout that long life, a story he wishes yet to change...
At the age of seventeen Jake Sisko was a witness as his father was lost in an accident that involved a lot of technobabble.
He was hunted by that accident by random hallucinations about his father who suddenly appeared out of nowhere, disappearing as suddenly.
As more time passed, Jake learned the trutht behind these appearances and began a fanatic quest to change history to the way it was before his father left him alone...
Sounds like the biggest Star Trek clich turned into a predictable episode to increase the ratings? That's exactly what ""The Visitor"" seems to be at first glance, but it turns out to be also something else.
It's a story about the character of Jake Sisko, the hugely ignored character who always behaves immaturely for his age and is only given horrible sub-plots that are taken straight from Sweet Valley High.
But this time, Michael Piller has created a story that reveals him to us in a way never seen before. As Jake journeys through the years, first interpered by the not so talented Cirroc Lofton and later the strong and insightfull acting performance of Tony Todd, the character resieves new depht and dimension.
The pacing of the story is exellent and David Livingston's directing brings the story to life with amazing color and freshness, resulting into a truly mature and emotional combination of exellent drama and insightfull plotting.
""The Visitor"" is surprisingly good considering the unoriginality of the story, and offers forty minutes of TNG style drama that gives new insights and approaches to the whole show, even if it's as calculated as it can only be.",1017705600,3,1911,4.829268292682927
7903136,5,B000003K82,"Tony Todd turns in an outstanding performance portraying Jake Sisko as an old man.  The story takes place about 50 years after Benjamin Sisko disappears aboard the Defiant.  A young aspiring writer visits jake to question him why he quit writing so long ago.  He proceeds to tell her about the day his father disappeared.  The story is told in flashbacks as we learn that although Jake was haunted by Ben's death, he nonetheless married and became a famous writer.  But when Ben starts appearing to Jake for brief periods of time, Jake thinks his father may be alive in some kind of alternate dimension or universe.  He spends most of the next 50 years trying to figure out a way to retrieve his beloved father.  He sacrifices his marriage and career to this end.  But in order to get his father back, he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.
You will need a box of kleenex to watch this heartfelt episode.  The bond that exists between father and son is showcased here.  On a lesser note, we also get to see Jadzia and Dr. Bashir aged 20-30 years (decent makeup work).  Nog also makes an appearance as a captain, having risen in the Federation ranks over the years.",1009670400,3,1169,4.519047619047619
7903137,5,B000003K82,"This episode is, by far, one of the absolute best of the entire DS9 series.  In my opinion, it is a ""must see"" for DS9 fans, and for Trek fans in general.
In this episode, an accident on board the Defiant separates Captain Sisko from his young son Jake, and the balance of the episode tells the story of what Jake does with that separation over the course of his lifetime.
In the timeline presented, Ben occasionally appears to Jake...but only for a few seconds before disappearing again.  The brief, frantic, interchanges between this father and son over the course of many years is heartwrenching...and valuable lessons can be learned from them.  Lessons about dealing with loss, regret, and the instinct to hang on to hope.
Avery Brooks gives a stunning performance as Ben Sisko, and the actors that play Jake Sisko during various periods of his life do an excellent job as well.  I give this episode 5 stars, but it really deserves more than that!  A ""must see"".",1008115200,3,966,4.658823529411765
