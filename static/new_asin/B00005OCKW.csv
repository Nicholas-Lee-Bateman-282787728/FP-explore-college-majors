1640897,1,B00005OCKW,"This Australian film directed by Carl Schultz was much heralded when it was first released, but viewing it now, one can't think why. Based on the novel by Sumner Locke Elliott and adapted by Michael Jenkins, this tale of two sisters over the custody of another dead sister's child, reads as soap opera with melodramatic flourishes and an awful sugary music score by Ray Cook. It's hard to admire DOP John Seale, particularly in the way he first presents the second sister bathed in light, and the child POV's shots, when the large picture is less than successful.
There is a certain Charles Dickensien element with one sister wealthy and the other poor, though you can guess which one demonstrates more maternal instinct. Not only is the rich one made neurotically afraid of thunder, she's also known as ""the virgin queen"". We aren't given any explaination for her greater wealth, though naturally she gets better lighting and wardrobe.
It's to Wendy Hughes' credit that she manages to maintain some dignity, given the obstacles Schultz puts in her way. However, as the poor sister, Robyn Nevin isn't so lucky, which is practically a crime given Nevin's legendary status as a stage performer. Nevin actually had a triumph in a TVM of Locke Elliott's Water Under the Bridge. That story was a large scale exercise in irony, something which is only suggested here in the fate of Hughes. The only actor that is alowed to invest some truth and feeling is John Hargreaves as the errant father of the child, unfortunately a minor role.
What is one to think of Schultz when he labours over schoolyard humiliations of the child, played with an adult knowingness by Nicholas Gledhill, has Hughes project her female frustrations onto the child, and has Gledhill lead a party gathering of children in a mock parade of Hughes' cries of anguish? It's all pretty icky stuff and a compliment to no one concerned.",1003536000,2,1896,4.836923076923077
1640898,4,B00005OCKW,"In many ways this is a heartbreaking story of the covert incest of a young boy who would have been comploetely destroyed if he had spent more time with the neurotic (dare I say sociopathic?) wealthy aunt.  Is it too much of a cliche to say that wealth is no guarantee of human feeling?  Some of the warmest and happiest people I know exist just above the poverty level, like so many do.  Others have mentioned the fine acting, particularly by the young boy who plays P.S.  A genuine miracle!  In my humble opinion the positive parting words given by the wealthy aunt, Vanessa, just before she died did not redeem the terrible, cold, regimented treatment of a boy too young to defend himself.  The symbolism of the gold nugget I really liked.  It was P.S.'s link to sanity in an insane situation one wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.",1405728000,2,833,4.513333333333334
1640899,5,B00005OCKW,"I have loved this film since it debuted in the 80s and worried about finding it on DVD now that my video would no longer play on my new machine.  Thankfully, I found it, at an exorbitant cost, I might add, but it is worth it to have it back in my collection.  I use it in my writing classes a lot to demonstrate how one can depict aspects of one's childhood, which is something ""Careful, He Might Hear You"" does so well.  It's one of those stories the Australians do so well on film and certainly leaves a lasting impression.",1383177600,,525,4.178217821782178
1640900,5,B00005OCKW,"I saw this film when it played in Washinton, DC and left the movie house very impressed with the story, the superb acting by the whole cast and the wonderful cinematography and music score.  In addition it is an Australian film.  A definite plus!.",1381363200,2,247,4.590909090909091
1640901,5,B00005OCKW,"I never tire of this film, with it's marvelously subtle performances true to the period and the storyline. Wendy Hughes - beautiful woman, great actor, and Robyn Nevin and Chris Haywood represent a class of actors from the 1970s that is Australia's equivalent to the New York/Hollywood actors in America in the 1950s - actors who create iconic roles that you never forget. This period of film making has gone now, but this movie is a classic.",1343779200,2,442,4.753246753246753
1640902,5,B00005OCKW,IT VERY GOOD SHOW AND REALLY SOME SAD AND HAPPY SO IT GREAT MOVIE. I KNOW THE BOY IS GOWN UP NOW. HE GOOD ACTION.,1314921600,,113,3.56
1640903,5,B00005OCKW,This was 1 of 2 movies I rented when it first came out. I decided to watch this movie last (it didn't sound that exciting)and started watching it around 1:00am (I fiqured I would finish it in the morning). I was literaaly riveted to the screen for the entire movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen.,1302134400,,304,4.258620689655173
1640904,5,B00005OCKW,"I loved this movie...the scenery, the musical score, but most of all the little boy. What a wonderful actor.
Most of his acting was done with facial expressions. You knew immediately what he was feeling. I would highly recommend the film.",1233273600,5,238,4.829268292682927
1640905,5,B00005OCKW,"I must say, I have read many reviews on this website about this movie, yet no one has talked about the movie itself, but just about the music and bits and pieces of the movie are being torn apart by most viewers. I saw this movie when it first came out. It's a good story. It's about two sisters trying to get custody of their 7 year old nephew. One sister is single, and in love with the boy's father, and thinks by raising him, she'll win the father's heart. The other sister truely loves the boy along with her husband, they have raised him so far. This sister, who loves the boy, is middle-low class and has medical problems which the rich sister tries to use against her in court. When the rich sister wins custody of the boy, she finds that the boy doesn't like her, and wants to go back to the other sister. It's a real battle, with the rich sister not even considering what the poor little boy wants, which is to live with his other aunt. It's a sad movie, really, if you have kids, it makes you think about what your kids might go through if you don't have a will in tact. Anyway, when all is said and done, dear old dad doesn't want custody of little P.S., and the rich sister drowns in a accident, so P.S. gets to live with who he wanted to begin with! Long time coming you must say. It's a good movie, if you like foreign films. My kids don't like accents, so I have a hard time getting them to watch this movie. I myself liked it and recommend watching it. This movie is set in the 1930's Australia. The acting is wonderful, and the all around story is great. It sure gets me stressed out when poor little P.S tries to explain to the judge that he wants to live with his Aunt Lila. When the judge asks him why, he says Lila told him to say that, but what he meant was Lila told him to tell the judge the truth and tell him who he wants to really live with, but when he says ""Lila told me to say that"", the judge thinks Lila is putting words in his mouth. Which was not the case. Lila truely loves P.S. and has raised him since his mother died.",1146614400,9,2056,4.079012345679012
1640906,5,B00005OCKW,"I'm afraid we have a difference of opinion here for CHMHY,split between pro and con. Well let me throw in my vote for the pro side. Ever since I first viewed this film it has haunted me,I knew I had to own it-so I got a copy of the tape,now I think I have to get the DVD.The performances all around are impeccable,Hughes,Nevin,and especially the child actor,Gledhill. I wonder whatever became of him? Was this just a flash in the pan role for him or did he go on acting regionaly?It is a performance of remarkable sensitivity and naturalism. That said the film itself looks great. Lush and golden the colors pop out at you. The musical score is one that I also had to seek out for its singular delicate beauty-is Ray Cook another regional talent, I can't think of another score that he has composed?It has a sort of P.Glass-like hypnotic quality. Then there is the story itself a shameless tearjerker I'll admit but so real, and skewed with a sense of unreallity-an almost supernatural quality near the end.(The Wendy Hughes boat departure scene,short as it is has a flash of ""Titanic"" terror about it,and at the same time a sad irony. Anyway this duality is what keeps me coming back to this film again and again. It's a small classic.",1014854400,16,1236,4.547085201793722
1640907,4,B00005OCKW,"Careful he might hear you, is one of those old films I saw many times on VHS only because it has a beautiful score. 17 years later the film stands up to the test of time and still gets me in a place where I am enthralled by the very young lead actors performance and Wendy Hughes performance as Vanessa. Its a dark tale about a little boy caught between the custody chains of two sisters and the fight they ensue to adopt him. Good stuff.",1004400000,3,438,4.104651162790698
