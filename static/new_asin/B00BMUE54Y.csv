8571033,5,B00BMUE54Y,"I bought this as a gift for my wife.  Unlike many of Ghibli's films it is aimed at adults not children.

The story of a woman looking back on her life, it is probably Ghibli's most nostalgic film.

I was initially concerned if it would play on a US BlueRay player, but it works fine.",1457654400,3,283,4.109090909090909
8571034,5,B00BMUE54Y,waited a long time for this one. english subtitles. works in u.s.  one of my all time fav animes.  will buy again if dubbed in english.,1457395200,2,135,4.153846153846154
8571035,5,B00BMUE54Y,"This is one of Studio Ghibli's early releases.  The animation is more ""primitive"" and cruder than recent releases such as ""From Up on Poppy Hill"".  You will not find this movie for a domestic release because it covers how a girl handles situations of having their first menstrual periods in school.  This was considered a no-no by Disney, so they never opted to not release it in the U.S.

The premise of the film is about a city woman who goes back to the countryside to work on a farm on her vacation.  She has flashbacks about her childhood as she travels home.

This movie is an adult drama.  Kids will not find this movie entertaining at all.  As a drama, it is very open on some childhood issues.  Amazing that animations can be made to be so fulfilling...",1426204800,9,762,4.424460431654676
8571036,5,B00BMUE54Y,"I first saw this film in 2006 on Turner Classic Movies, which I believe is the only time it was ever broadcast in the United States.  I fell in love with the film, despite not being in the demographic they were aiming for, and wanted to own it on DVD.  However, I found out later that it had not been released on video in the United States and that it likely never would be.  Last year I tracked down a Malaysian copy (which may or may not be legitimately licensed) on DVD which was region-free and in NTSC picture format; however, the DVD's presentation had many flaws, ranging from minor to serious.  But, at the time, this seemed like the only way I would be able to own a copy of the film.
Thankfully, I recently discovered that the Blu Ray versions from Japan, Taiwan, and China were compatible with US Blu Ray players (I guess I should have educated myself on Blu Ray regions sooner), so I bought the Hong Kong edition released by IVL.  I am very impressed with this release.  They do not force you to sit through or skip any ads or previews before the simple and clean menu comes up.  It's very easy to select the language and subtitles and then jump quickly to the film.  The menu choices are all in English so there's no guesswork needed.
The film itself is presented in 1080p widescreen, and the picture quality and color is much better than my old DVD version.  It appears to have been remastered, though it still has a pleasant amount of film grain and character.  There are some noticeable instances of frame jitter, which probably would have been fixed if this had been a Disney release in the US.  However, I didn't mind it.  The English subtitles seemed perfect.  All in all, I'm ecstatic about finally having a great version of this film on home video.  I don't mind at all the lack of extras (only the storyboards are included).  I heavily recommend this version if you are in the US and want to own this film on disc.  Since the film was never dubbed into English, you're not really missing anything that would have been included on a theoretical (though unlikely) US release.
As for the film itself, it's wonderful.  There are far better writers than myself who have reviewed and discussed this film, so I'll only briefly talk about it.  It's the story of a woman named Taeko who is a 27-year-old office worker from Tokyo.  She takes a vacation to the countryside to pick safflower in the fields with her brother-in-law's family.  Before she even leaves Tokyo, she is struck by a sudden and unshakeable case of nostalgia, reflecting on the time when she was 10 years old.  The film takes place in 1982 (which is the ""present"" for the 27-year old Taeko) with frequent flashbacks to the days of her childhood, with a different animation style for these two periods.  The events of her childhood are presented more-or-less episodically (a little like Isao Takahata's later film My Neighbors the Yamadas), with some episodes (like the family's attempt at cutting and eating a real pineapple for the first time) being minor and seemingly random, and others being more important and life-changing.  In the ""present,"" Taeko is forced to look at her life and come to terms with how she views herself and what she wants from life.  I won't spoil anything else about it, but I will say that by the time the screen fades to black at the end, I am usually a bit misty-eyed.
Only Yesterday is a somewhat-under-appreciated gem from Studio Ghibli, and, at least in the United States, probably the most obscure of their theatrical releases, due to the fact that it was only broadcast here once and never released on video domestically.  It's a slower-paced, ""slice of life"" sort of film, and there are no villains (unless you consider Taeko's emotionally-distant father a villain) or even a serious central crisis (except of the existential variety) to propel the film.  I find the thoughtful pace relaxing, and the film mostly has a quiet, gentle quality to it.  Some will possibly find it boring due to the pacing and the two-hour length, but I think it may surprise some people as to how much they end up enjoying it if they give it a chance.",1421452800,13,4149,4.579161028416779
8571037,5,B00BMUE54Y,"A single woman reminisces about her bittersweet childhood while trying to find her place in the world in this moving animated film from Japan in 1991.  Rarely shown in the US due to its very Japanese settings, this beautifully crafted film breaks some ground in using animation to tell a non-sci-fi, non-comedic, adult, realistic drama, something which is still rarely done in the west.  Like many Japanese animated films, ""Only Yesterday"" originated from graphic novels.  The film was based on the semi-autobiographical manga of the same name, and was directed by Isao Takahata of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" fame.  The hand-drawn, painterly drawings are perfect for the nostalgic nature of the story, and they are sheer beauty to look at on this high-definition Blu-ray I'm reviewing.

""Only Yesterday"" was produced by Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli, which made other animated classics like ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", and ""Spirited Away"" that are quite well-known to western viewers.  ""Only Yesterday"", however, is its only film that has never been released in North America.  Other than a one-time broadcast on TCM in 2006, there has been no theatrical nor home video releases.  Those who wish to see it will have to import foreign home video editions.

(Edit May-06-2016: This film will be released for North America on Blu-ray, ASIN: B01E9O0Q0Q, and DVD, ASIN: B01E9O0QVU, by Universal on July 5, 2016.  It will feature a new English dub as well as the original Japanese audio track.)

""Only Yesterday"" has been released on DVD and Blu-ray in Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  The DVDs came out about 10 years ago and they used old prints that may not look as good today.  The Blu-rays, however, came out within the past year and have beautiful, restored picture.  North America is fortunately in the same Blu-ray region (""A"") as these East Asian countries, so the Blu-rays made there are playable here.

All 3 Blu-ray editions come with well-written, optional English subtitles.  But none has English dubs.  No English dub has ever been made for this film.  All discs have a lossless surround Japanese audio track.  The Taiwanese Blu-ray also has a lossy Mandarin track and optional Chinese subtitles, while the Hong Kong disc has a lossy Cantonese track and optional Chinese subtitles.

The Japanese Blu-ray also includes lossy German and Korean audio tracks and French, German, and Korean subtitles.  But the Japanese disc costs more.  Including shipping charge, it could cost you 60-70 US dollars.  At Yesasia, the Hong Kong and Taiwanese Blu-rays each costs about 40 USD only.  The Taiwanese package costs a little more because it comes with a DVD copy (which is in Region-3 NTSC format).

Regarding bonus features, all three discs come with storyboard presentation of the film.  These are high-definition, high-quality scans of the original drawings by the filmmakers, so they look exceedingly good here.  Even if you have never bothered to look at these storyboards in past video editions, the Blu-ray's much-improved picture should make you more appreciative of them.  In Japan, these storyboards are highly regarded and have been published in book form.  That is the reason storyboards are present in nearly all home video editions of Studio Ghibli films.

The Japanese and Taiwanese Blu-rays also include a 46-minute making-of feature.  Shown in upconverted 1080i, this piece is narrated in Japanese, unsubtitled on the Japanese disc and subtitled in Chinese on the Taiwanese disc.  The Hong Kong Blu-ray has no such feature.  This is an excellent and fairly in-depth documentary on the making of ""Only Yesterday"" as well as the history of director Takahata and producer Hayao Miyazaki, with a number of film clips of their early works.  But as I mentioned, no English subtitles are provided, unfortunately.

The cover image shown currently at the Amazon page is of the Japanese Blu-ray edition, but the thumbnail picture you see when you search for this Blu-ray shows the cover of the Hong Kong Blu-ray edition.  Be sure to check with the seller which edition is being sold.

For parents who are concerned with showing this film to young children, note that no MPAA rating was ever given due to its never having been shown theatrically in the US.  But when it was broadcast on TCM, it was given a TV rating of PG.",1389744000,33,4346,5.043478260869565
