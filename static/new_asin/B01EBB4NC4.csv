8758298,4,B01EBB4NC4,"Typical goofy Lupin III fun, far from the top tier of the franchise but still entertaining and engaging.  A word of warning, as long-time fans already know, whenever Lupin introduces historical elements (usually the ""lost treasure"" of so-and-so), don't expect any kind of accuracy, but expect the history books to go through a wood chipper.",1482537600,,340,5.181818181818182

8758300,4,B01EBB4NC4,"I was so happy that Eastern Star jumped straight from From Siberia With Love to Alcatraz Connection and skipped the eight films in between which had already been released in western countries. I assume Eastern Star will be skipping over Episode 0: First Contact and go straight to Operation: Return the Treasure. Were still 15 years behind Japan but since Eastern Star has been releasing multiple movies a year theoretically we should eventually catch up. Weve even gotten a few more recent films such as Lupin III vs Detective Conan and Jigens Gravestone so its a good time to be a Lupin the 3rd fan.

Alcatraz Connection takes place entirely in and around San Francisco. Inspector Zenigata has an American partner who is established early on as a bit shady. The treasure this time is millions in gold that sank in San Francisco Bay laying 6000m under water. The makers of the film were a little lapse in their research considering the maximum depth in the bay is 113m. Opposing Lupin and his gang are the American mafia or in this case the ancestors of many of Americas most famous gangsters. Their main enforces are the Secret Seven, a group of seven assassins, each with a unique talent.

Alcatraz Connection is one of the better Lupin movies but it still has the feel of something made for TV. The animation is inconsistent, sometimes very impressive and other times quite average. I particularly enjoyed the opening sequence which included a very catchy theme song even if the lyrics were pretty horrid. The plot is interesting but it gets bogged down at around the two thirds mark with all sorts of messiness involving the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and a secret mob paradise under Alcatraz. I think the conspiracies could have worked but everything is over explained. Im going to watch the movie again and see if I feel the same way about the plot on second viewing.

Overall its a fun movie even if later revelations cause earlier events to make no sense. I think the writer may have let the plot get a bit out of control. This one has some good music and all the characters are handled well. Not as good as the recent Jigens Gravestone but a nice addition to my Lupin library.",1465776000,,2201,4.667525773195877
