8189219,3,B000P6R5SE,"I ordered this from Biography a couple of years back. Like the other reviewer, I was hoping for more of the past game shows. People like Bill Cullen are barely mentioned, if at all. The more modern shows get to shine, but if you were hoping for a nostalgia trip like I was, you're going to be a bit disappointed. The game show salute done on WNET did a better job, in my opinion.",1255910400,5,379,4.135135135135135
8189220,3,B000P6R5SE,"I was a bit disappointed in this video, because it spent too much (and shouldn't have given any) time on the gross game shows of today where people eat bugs, pee to ""tinkle"" a bell, and shows just how far game shows, TV, and the public have sunk in the past 50 years.

The parts about the great game shows, their hosts, and prizes were interesting, and fun to watch.",1206835200,12,366,4.228571428571429
