1930032,5,B0000DZRCP,"Simply love this movie with a great cast like Arjun Rampal, Mahima Chaudry, Rekha and most of all Preity Zinta with her superb acting which made this movie such a winner.
 The story revolves around a mother(Rekha) and her 2 daughters, one being her real biological daughter(Mahima Chaudry) and the other an adopted one( Preity Zinta) from her husband's affair with another woman. Anyway, both husband and mistress perished in a car accident and upon his death bed he made her promised to adopt the younger daughter as her own. How the whole story played out was a heart wrenching mother-daughter relationship,full of resentment from the mother for her adopted daughter and in turn feelings of neglect and unlove from younger daughter who was unaware of her adoption since little. What held it together while growing up in this family was the unconditional love from her older sister and as the movie progresses one sister had to sacrifice her love of the guy (they both fell in love with the same man of course)for the sake of the other sister.......
 Rekha's performance as the cold mother and a doting one at the same time was fantastic but Preity Zinta was the obvious star in the movie with her outstanding performance. She played her character so well with such vivacity & fire as well as heartbreaking sadness in some scenes- guaranteed to bring you some tears!
All the songs were fantastic. In fact, it isn't often to find a movie with ALL of the sound tracks so memorable and enjoyable. Dil Hai Tumhara is worth watching and keeping.",1321488000,,1541,4.7677902621722845
1930033,4,B0000DZRCP,"Dil Hai Tumhaara is not a great film but it is a heartwarming family drama which was made in the most traditional way. The last few scenes become increasingly and typically emotional.

You just feel its profound, unrestrained Hindi film style all over, but it works. All the songs, without exception, are melodious and beautiful. Having said that, the main and only reason this film works consists of two words: Preity Zinta.",1304467200,,425,4.902777777777778
1930034,5,B0000DZRCP,"This is a good movie (after the dark 15 minute beginning then first half is mostly silly, over-the-top, second half is serious/intense).

But it is mislabeled on Amazon - the discs being sold at this link (by all vendors associated here) are  NOT  anamorphic.

The only 'anamorphic' version of this DVD disc for America (NTSC format, dual layer) is from 'Madhu'.  That DVD cover has a big smiling face of 'Preity Zinta' in the upper left corner on the front.  The DVD ""cover"" that is being incorrectly advertised here at this link (by Amazon) is the same ""cover"" as found on the British release for PAL format (not American NTSC format).

This movie is primarily about sacrifice (typical theme for Bollywood), and it works here again.  I have watched it several times.

Concerning the actual movie quality of the good 'Madhu' disc (story/acting/dance/music) - the cast is solid, the story is good, while the picture quality is average.  I really liked the music (3 songs are special) and the last dance scene is beautiful/touching.  If this ever comes out on a good transfer blu-ray, I will be buying it!",1292025600,2,1104,4.788359788359788
1930035,5,B0000DZRCP,It's agreat movie and beautiful songs. I love it! Can watch it again and again.,1262304000,,79,4.333333333333333
1930036,4,B0000DZRCP,"This is about 2 sisters (Preity Zinta and Mahima Chaudhry) more than anything. They have always been very close but don't realize that, though they share a common father, one of them is his illegitimate daughter to another woman. Father had 2 families and died with his other wife: asking his real wife (Rekha) to bring his other daughter up as her own. She does this but resents the child. Eventually a new man comes into their lives (Arjun Rampal). He falls for the illegitimate one but the real daughter thinks he loves her and a wedding is arranged with everyone being noble and not letting the truth out (including Jimmy Shergill who also loves the illegitimate one).
There you have a typical Bollywood romance/melodrama of multiple triangles, a problematic mother-daughter relationship, and the closest of sisterly bonds.
I found this a little slow to get going and the music unmemorable (though some of the songs did their usual job of filling in thoughts and emotions brewing beneath the surface). However the acting was all good and there are some really fine actors among them. Preity and Mahima did a great job of building the connected sister bond. Arjun is pleasing to the eye and did a good job too as the romantic interest. Rekha as the Mum has a powerful presence as the 'force to be reckoned with' Mum. Then there was Jimmy and Alok Nath (as Arjun's Dad) who had more minor roles but rose to their parts as they generally do well.
We ended up settling into this and enjoying it a lot (It even brought a few tears and I always appreciate ones that get you in enough to enable that!)
Elsewhere on the 'Net this tends to get above average and Preity was nominated for an award at the time for it. Those watching in our house agreed it was a 4 out of 5- and a keeper.",1243555200,,1780,4.513931888544891
1930037,5,B0000DZRCP,"I loved this movie.  Romance, love and importance of family
Well worth watching over and over subtitles and all.",1233014400,,112,4.894736842105263
1930038,4,B0000DZRCP,"In DIL HAI TUMHAARA the spotlight is firmly on Preity Zinta, Bollywood's dimpled and perky goddess. Preity is a natural in the acting biz and, from what I've seen on live interviews, seems to be a genuine, down-to-earth person in real life. She's the reason I bought this dvd, and she, Rekha, and Mahima Chaudhary provide the overwhelming reason to watch this film.

So, as laid out in the film's first few minutes, this is what's going on: Sarita (Rekha, KOI...MIL GAYA and KRRISH), mother to young Nimmi, shockingly finds out that her husband has been having an ongoing affair and had fathered another girl, Shalu. When her husband and the ""other"" woman become fatal casualties of an auto accident, Sarita very reluctantly agrees to raise Shalu as her very own. So Shalu grows up thinking that Sarita is her biological mother. But showering love on Shalu is something which Sarita can never bring herself to do, so she is only affectionate to Nimmi. However, Nimmi and Shalu grow up as loving sisters, even though Shalu incessantly acts up in a bid for her ""mother's"" attentions.

Meanwhile, over the years and as the sisters mature, Sarita has moved up in the world, having become the mayor of Palampur. Currently, she finds herself embroiled in a power play with a conniving politician who covets her position. This politician is in cahoots with the two crooked heads of an apple production plant owned by Khanna Industries. I mention this because Shalu shortly becomes involved in the doings as she first procures a job at the same plant and then meets Dev Khanna, who is heir to Khanna Industries. Dev (Arjun Rampal) has infiltrated the plant in hopes of discovering why it's incurring such heavy losses; he disguises himself as Anand, a lowly chauffer's son.

It's inevitable that Dev and Shalu meet cute and initially detest each other (""Bloody driver!"") before the usual mushy shenanigans ensue. Then we have the following flies in this romantic ointment: Shalu's sister Nimmi also falls for Dev and then Shalu's ventriloquist friend Sameer (Jimmy Shergil), who has been in love with Shalu for ages, returns from Japan.

But all this romantic excess just serves to bog down the film and gets in the way of the film's real interest. The heart of DIL HAI TUMHAARA lies in a girl's quest to win her mother's love and a mother's eventual acceptance of this girl who was conceived from the most extreme of betrayals. It's a cold fact that, here, the women actors clearly outshine the men. Rekha is an intense actress born with that gift of being still. It's not a serene type of calmness, no; it's an icy stillness which suggests an anguished turmoil simmering beneath the stoic facade. Rekha is very clear in her portrayal of a mother doing her best in a most untenable situation. In her dealings with Shalu, I can't really blame her for being stingy with her affections. There is a ferocious, mesmerizing scene in which Rekha's character finally cuts loose as she searingly and vindictively confronts Shalu. Whew! Certainly, Rekha can exude venomous scorn like no one else in Bollywood. She's excellent.

Preity Zinta, normally bubbly and spirited, shows off her acting chops, as well. Her best moment and the film's best heart-tugging scene come when she crashes an engagement celebration and, in front of everyone, vulnerably confesses her illegitimacy to Dev's father. When watching it, I dare you to not tear up. Preity demonstrates again that she's one of the leading young actresses on the Indian cinematic landscape. Not to mention, she is very, very cute and engaging. And a shout out to her dimples.

Mahima Chaudhary makes the very most of her part as Shalu's gentle and generous sister Nimmi. She's quite wonderful and threatens to steal several scenes from Preity and Rekha. Mahima and Preity are convincing as sisters who bear a truly close bond, and you feel for them as they each make their own sacrifices to benefit the other. Arjun Rampal, Bollywood's response to Keanu Reaves, is again wooden but serviceable, barely. He's a good looking robot. I have to say that the movie's attempts at comedy, when involving Arjun, are quite feeble (""Chang's theory of business disguise,"" my fanny). Meanwhile, Jimmy Shergil's part as Sameer the puppeteer is vastly underwritten and, let's face it, that dummy of his is weird and often seems to have an independent life of its own. And it's lame that Sameer would insist on involving his puppet in normal, every day conversations.

Brace yourself for an inundation of songs here (9 in total). For the most part, the musical numbers are pleasant enough, if forgettable, and they do advance the plot. At three hours long, the picture drags a bit, thanks largely to all that romantic baggage. Still, DIL HAI TUMHAARA is very much worth seeing for its portrayal of a mother's relationship with her daughters. I can't mention enough how very, very good Preity, Mahima, and Rekha are as they invest their characters with real depth and emotions. You'll weep at their performances. Of course, you'll want to weep at Arjun Rampal's performance, as well, but for different reasons. Lastly, I can't help but want to take a sip from Khanna Industries's new product, Refresh. The way it was depicted in the film, this new line of apple juice seems to be the shiznit.",1181952000,4,5314,4.865193370165746
