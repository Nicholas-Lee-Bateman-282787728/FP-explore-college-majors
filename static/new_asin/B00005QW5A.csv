1652006,5,B00005QW5A,"This is a dream for Buster Keaton fans. All of is greatest
work is in this box set, such movies as The General, Sherlock Jr, Steamboat Bill Jr, Seven chances and if some
of the other features are a little weaker, you get you're money's worth with the 19 shorts wich are included in the package. The majority of these short films are hilarious and you can watch them often and never get tired. A nice addition to this box set is the 11th disc wich include a short film who was not complete until recently and a melting pot of tv appearances, tv commercials and 2 short films with an older Buster but still as funny. Also a virtual tour of the Keaton studio and locations all around california where he used to shoot his work. The quality of the transfer by Kino Video is quite remarkable knowing that these movies are about 75 years old, it's obvious that this is a labour of love. If you're a fan of Buster like me this is a must buy. If you don't know Buster Keaton, get to know him, he's a comic genius.",1007164800,20,1005,4.212435233160622

1652018,5,B00005QW5A,"1/2011 - If you like Buster Keaton, spend the money for this box set!  After seeing only a handful of Keaton's shorts and features I bought this set and there are no disappointments here.

1/2012 - I recently introduced my dad to Buster's movies and he loves them!  He had never before watched a silent movie and now when I visit he always asks that I bring another Buster film over to watch.  We started with several shorts like Cops and The Goat.  When we watched The General, I wasn't sure if I could capture his attention for 1 hour+ with a silent film, but he couldn't stop talking about how great the movie was.  What a great way to spend time with dad and how cool is it that Buster gains new fans 80-90 years after his films are released?!?!  What a genius he was.",1294617600,2,772,4.2465753424657535
1652019,5,B00005QW5A,The Art of Buster Keaton is a very very good collection of Buster Keaton films. Buster is my favorite of all the silent clowns.

1652023,5,B00005QW5A,"I am a huge Charlie Chaplin fan and the only time I saw Buster Keaton was his small part in ""Limelight"". However, having decided that I enjoy silent comedies, I took the plunge and bought this box set. I have no regrets whatsoever. After viewing the movies in this set, I can definitely say that Keaton was a comedic genius; he was a close second to Chaplin and I say this as a Harold Lloyd fan as well.

As for the reviews that the shorts are superior to the the films, I somewhat disagree; I totally loved ""The General"", ""Our Hospitality"", ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."", ""Sherlock Jr."", and ""The Navigator"". Although the shorts are definitely hilarious, the brillance of the features should not be overlooked.

So, for any fans of silent comedies, I highly recommend the Buster Keaton box set. You won't regret it. Promise.",1202688000,2,817,4.666666666666667
1652024,5,B00005QW5A,"Those of us who bought The Art of Buster Keaton on VHS back in the mid-90s ended up having to buy it all over again when the DVD revolution hit.  That's okay, though, because Buster is always worth it.  The fun of the boxed set is the extra disk full of rarities and tidbits (the best being John Bengtson's offerings).  All of Buster's features and most of his shorts are here, though there are missteps here and there.  The music offered on Sherlock Jr. is atrocious, and the lack of commentaries or other offerings on the films themselves make this collection pale somewhat in comparison with the Harold Lloyd extravaganza that followed in 2005.

Other DVD collections have been released in the interim, but my heart has a special place for this one, because it was the first after a long, dry spell.  I may add to my Buster Keaton film sets, in order to provide myself with better versions of certain films, but I'll never replace this one.",1189900800,3,943,4.550295857988166
1652025,5,B00005QW5A,"I think that this is the best collection of Keaton's Slient Films that I have seen.  I was not sure at first if I should or should not buy this product.

Besides these movies there is a bonus disc which shows Buster Keaton playing a serious role.  Overall I thought that this was one of the best collection of silent films that I have bought recently.",1189468800,7,1136,4.339622641509434
1652036,5,B00005QW5A,"Thus utters a confused patron of a vaudeville house who is confronted by Buster Keaton and his minstrels accompanied by a conductor and his orchestra, all clones of Buster Keaton in the classic short ""The Playhouse"". He really was the whole show during his independent years - writer, director, star. This collection consists of Keaton's surviving work from the years he was an independent film maker from the year 1920 when he struck out on his own after partnering with Roscoe Arbuckle for two years, and before he made the tragic decision to sign with MGM in 1928. It seems there are as many opinions on which of Keaton's features and shorts during his silent years are his finest and which are merely good as there are viewers of his films. To me, Buster's best work was when he was in a role in which there was an urgent matter of the heart involved - whether the object of his affection was a locomotive, a girl, or in the case of ""Go West"", a cow by the name of ""Old Brown Eyes"". Buster usually played a shy sincere fellow, often thrown into adverse circumstances he did not fully comprehend. However, he was resourceful and courageous in a pinch and always found a way to triumph in the end. When he first decided to go into the film industry he took a camera apart and put it back together just to see how it worked, and his love of the camera and what it could do showed in films like ""The Playhouse"" and ""Sherlock Jr."" where, in addition to Buster's usual stunts and displays of physical agility, he made use of special effects that were definitely way ahead of their time. There is an extra disc in this set entitled ""Keaton Plus"" which mainly consists of Keaton's work after his time at MGM. There are two of his better Educational Pictures shorts, ""Aleez Oop"" (1934) and ""Jail Bait"" (1937). There are also several TV appearances, including a purely dramatic role Buster took in a segment of ""Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Presents"" entitled ""The Awakening"" from 1954. Also included are various tributes, a couple of commercials Buster starred in, and a rather extensive photo gallery.

No doubt this set is a large financial investment. If you are unfamiliar with Keaton's work and would like a ""test drive"", try either ""Buster Keaton: The Great Stone Face of Comedy"" or the three disc set ""The Buster Keaton Collection"" by St. Clair Vision. Both sets are only ten dollars and both include ""The General"" and quite a few of his silent era shorts. Then you can make an informed decision about this set.",1184457600,4,2507,4.608501118568233
1652037,5,B00005QW5A,"SO glad I spent literally half a paycheck on this collection . Keaton was , quite simply , brilliant . His amazing stunts and incredible agility put so many present-day actors to shame . As for that signature ""stone face""....The man could say so much more with his eyes than any spoken words could ever express . Truly unsurpassed talent .",1179360000,8,339,4.573770491803279
1652038,5,B00005QW5A,"I know spending $100 seems expensive when you can buy an Asian copy on eBay for $30 or $40. But when you do that, nothing is going to David Shepard to compensate him for acquiring these films, transfering them to video, doing some restoration, and adding a sound track. Even if these films are in the public domain, they don't save themselves. It takes time and money to do that. Please help preserve our rapidly disintegrating silent film heritage and buy the DVDs produced by the people doing the work of preservation.",1168300800,22,520,4.663043478260869
1652039,5,B00005QW5A,"Buster Keaton still remains among the most reduced and even exigent list of the greatest exponents of the comedy genre.

It has been a common place to establsih the comparison between his craft and Charlot, and in this particular if I was inquired, I would say the main virtue of Keaton's grandess and obviously his personal landmark, is the kaleidoscopic vision he always around the characters and situations; while Charlot turned around the sentiments and the hope for a new and promising future, Keaton showed a demolishing narrative speech, hovered by a corrosive humor, deeply human but extremely devastating.

On the other hand, the resource economy and the emblematic expression of his facial grimace was another engaging tool to captivate the audiences.

I admire both of them and consider they represent the two sides of the same coin. Humanity above any other artistic considerations or sharp differences, was in last instance, the common denominator around these two genius of the intelligent humor.

A must for the hard collectors.",1162425600,3,1043,5.190476190476191
1652040,4,B00005QW5A,"First off, Keaton is one of the great artists of all times, and it's a joy to have such a complete collection of his silent work. (His last few silents, The Cameraman and Spite Marriage, and his sound films are a far cry from Keaton's best, and I suggest leaving them alone unless you're the absolute completist.) Kino has done a superb job on the features, restoring them to the best they've looked in decades and adding funny, unobtrusive musical scores. A perfect 5 here.

So what's not to like? I am saddened by the treatment of the shorts on these discs. They have *not* been restored, and my impression is that they were taken from 16mm prints with wildly variable (and often quite poor) soundtracks. Keaton's shorts are every bit as wonderful and fascinating as his features, and for Kino to foist these second-rate prints off on us makes me sad.

If I could, I'd give 4.5 stars for this collection. Be prepared for a bit of a disappointment when running the shorts.",1130976000,27,973,4.586206896551724
1652041,5,B00005QW5A,"Before anything else, I agree with those who say that Keaton's shorts are all good; but I strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features. What usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say: OK, make me laugh. Keaton's features are funny -but they are also, and more important, beautifully shot, superbly acted and perfectly structured -which is something only the best actors/directors can put all together. There are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20's. Keaton's characters move in the real world, with real things, and that's part of what makes them lasting and unique.

In your shelves, Keaton shouldn't share his place with the Marx Brothers, but with Orson Welles (who called The General the best movie ever made about the Civil War) and Martin Scorsese (who said he watched over and over the final fight in Battling Butter -which, by the way, is not supposed to make you laugh, but to surprise you with it's realism)

Now, this are the complete contents of this DVD set. Aside from it, you should check out The Buster Keaton Collection, which includes THE CAMERAMAN, SPITE MARRIAGE and FREE AND EASY - and then you are done. Well, you could also read the only book he wrote -My Wonderful World of Slapstick. (June '06 Update: ""Industrial Strength Keaton""(DVD) just came out.

1652042,5,B00005QW5A,"Prices for this set vary (and even the lowest asking price isn't cheap), but any way it's a major bargain, considering how many discs and how much material you're getting out of it.  You get 11 feature-length films (although some of the features, like 'Sherlock, Jr.,' are under an hour long), 19 shorts, and an awesome bonus disc featuring commercials, later (sound) short films, a few introductions to some of his films from when they were aired on various television programs dedicated to silents, some of the silent shorts that were on the other discs but in more complete versions (thanks to missing footage that was discovered after they were initially reissued!), home movies (unfortunately the two sound-era ones have the audio cut off), photo galleries, and a whole lot more, adding up to over 3 hours total.  It's certainly saving money in the long run, given how much more expensive it would be to acquire all of these discs separately (though I do sympathise with those who are upset they paid the regular price for them only to later have this boxed set come out).

For the most parts, the prints used are great, although there are moments I noticed on some of the shorts where there were some frames of less-than-stellar quality.  However, given the age of the films involved, even if a first-class remastering team had worked with them, there's only so much they can do, and wouldn't you rather see some frames of sub-par pictorial quality than have these films lost like too many other films of this era are?  I also agree that some of the musical scores weren't the most ideal (particularly the ones that made liberal use of annoying sound effects), but it was nothing unlistenable or that wildly inappropriate.  I had only seen a few of Buster's features and shorts before buying this set, and made the plunge because the more I had seen of him, the more I'd liked and loved him.  I love and relate to all of the major silent clowns (and some of the silent clowns who are no longer as well-known as they once were, like Max Linder and Charley Chase) in different ways, but if I had to pick a special favorite, the one I loved most, I would certainly pick Buster.",1122076800,17,2180,4.632124352331606
1652043,5,B00005QW5A,"If you like Buster Keaton, I highly suggest you buy this along with the Buster Keaton Collection that has THE CAMERAMAN, SPITE MARRIAGE, and FREE AND EASY. This set has 10 full length movies, a sort of ""mini movie"" that's around 45 minutes (Sherlock, Jr.), and many shorts (most of the time two on a disc). Some of the full length movies aren't that good but have great shorts on the same disc. I don't like GO WEST, THE SAPHEAD, THE THREE AGES, or BATTLING BUTLERS as much as COLLEGE, THE NAVIGATOR, THE GENERAL, SHERLOCK, JR., STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., OUR HOSPITALITY, and SEVEN CHANCES. I can't think of a short I didn't like. I think some of his best work was in his shorts. If you have never seen Buster Keaton, I suggest going to Blockbuster or Netflix and rent THE GENERAL, STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., and SEVEN CHANCES to see if you like his work. I think you will. BUT BE WARNED. IF YOU HATE SILENT MOVIES, DON'T BUY THIS. ALL OF THE MOVIES AND SHORTS ARE SILENT. As for me, I don't care.",1119830400,7,986,4.364130434782608
1652044,5,B00005QW5A,"I have seen all these films in VHS format.  Anyone who watches them can tell that Keaton was a genius as well as a great entertainer.  Others have found fault with the musical scores, especially the one that accompanies Sherlock Jr.  In my opinion, this score is wonderful.  It adds an additional layer of fun to the film.  The Club Foot Orchestra, which performs the score, should be applauded.  Silent Films should get modern scores even if it ruffles the feathers of some purists.",1104364800,3,483,4.690476190476191
1652045,4,B00005QW5A,"Buster Keatons' talents as a performer,gagman,writer,director,et al are in evidence here to their fullest and greatest degree.
This DVD set of all of his works as an independant film maker during the 1920s are here for all of us to enjoy and to marvel at once more or for the first time.
Stan Laurel,another one of the true comedic geniuses of the cinema and his contemporary, once said of Buster:
""Another 'great'.....One of the reasons why I love Buster so much is because he lives comedy as well as practices it. Some of his things are better than Chaplins'""(from 'Mr. Laurel & Mr. Hardy'-John McCabe).
Truer words never spoken and this set proves Stans' words in spades.
Instead of getting into a detailed analysis of each film on technical/restoration and artistic merits(which considering the amount of films to review would take up more space than is available!),I will just give you a brief overview of the set.
As already stated the set contains ALL of his shorts AND his features from the 20s.
Now one must realize and be forewarned that the quality of these prints run from excellent to poor. A good portion fall somewhere between them.
The reasons for this are that some of these films I don't doubt strictly speaking from an age and condition standpoint are probably the best that are currently available and that could be obtained for this release.
Some I suspect were not the best obtainable prints available and /or were not restored to their fullest potential.
Some  also may be a combination of poor prints and lacklustre restoration work.
However when you view a top notch print it is a revelation. My vote for best film in this set is Seven Chances. It has the original two tint opening and I have never ever seen such a clear and crisp print of this film anywhere.
And as if getting ALL of Busters' features wasn't enough to satisfy even the most dedicated of Keaton-philes,Kino has inserted an extra DVD with some rare and hard to come by features on it. There are clips from his early 50s TV show,TV commercials,a couple of 30s shorts,The Awakening, a dramatic play aired on Douglas Fairbanks Jr.s' show(which I never tire of watching!),an interactive tour of Busters' film locations prepared by the author of Silent Echoes,John Bengston,and much more.
When it came to purchasing this set I was probably like many of you and balked when looking at the price tag. I finally took a deep breath and took the plunge and I'm SO glad I did and I know you won't be disappointed. The most important thing to remember when deciding is just think about the amount of material here and all in one place,at your finger tips. That finally decided it for me.
I hope it decides it for you too. And enjoy Buster at his finest!!",1102982400,13,2734,4.672199170124482
1652056,5,B00005QW5A,"Brilliant. Timeless. Sublime. Beautiful. Hilarious. Indispensable. Classic... Where to begin discussing the great Buster Keaton? Well, how about here for starters: YOUR FILM LIBRARY IS INCOMPLETE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN THIS ESSENTIAL BOX SET! And, due to the culturally vacuous nature of the general public, I can promise you these discs will not stay in print forever. So what are you waiting for?

The good folks at Kino have provided this historic collection, a virtually complete silent filmography of one of the worlds' greatest filmmakers - it would be a bargain at twice the price, really. While it's true that home video is emphatically not the best medium to enjoy silent movies, with their many variables (such as being at the mercy of a modern score by the tone-deaf Club Foot Orchestra, appropriately named and unfortunately in evidence here. Luckily the vast majority of the soundtrack music comes from other sources and is much better.) It's still vastly preferable to the alternative: i.e., never seeing these comic gems at all in any capacity.

One viewing of SHERLOCK, JR. is usually enough to make the average person a Keaton fan for life. (Try it yourself with your girlfriend if you don't believe me. It never fails!) And the prints are gorgeous for the most part. (Some of the films are so rare that only one original print is known to exist. In all cases the best available source was utilized.) If you don't happen to live around the corner from a silent movie revival theatre, this is the next best thing. A virtual how-to lesson in visual storytelling by one of cinema's undisputed geniuses.

So drop whatever you're doing and buy it now - before it's too late. You can thank me later.",1097452800,14,1712,4.836177474402731
1652057,5,B00005QW5A,"the old chaplin vs keaton thing seems all the more pointless upon viewing the bulk of keatons work.
comparing them is a bit like the old apples and oranges thing.
chaplin was certainly the better actor.
he was more emotional and stirred your feeling  far more than keaton.
but chaplin was not really an innovator like keaton was and in keatons best work his revolutionary aesthetics stand out.
works like 'playhouse' (in my opinion his greaest accomplishment)
and sherlock jr.
try comparing these to chaplins easy street and it simply cant be done.
this set was long overdue and it is a treasure to have, and i think to appreciate keaton you simply cant watch one of his films, you have to watch a group of them.
of course keaton paid the price for being just 'too artistic' and was duly punished in time by the system (for a while chaplin knew how to deal the sytem better than keaton did,).
invest in it and see the evolution of an important artist.",1086480000,10,951,4.52906976744186
1652058,4,B00005QW5A,"I had only seen a handful of Buster Keaton's films before deciding to take the plunge and buy the mammoth ""Art Of Buster Keaton"" DVD box set.  I'm glad I threw the dice and ordered this.  Here is silent filmmaking at its finest, with great attention to detail given to both short and feature films.  The films are good and, although some of them are showing their age, I expect these are the best prints possible.  You can't ask for anything more.
This is a huge collection of films (11 features and 19 shorts), so reviewing individual items is not going to be beneficiary.  These discs have also been released individually, and I've already written many words on each of them.  But in general terms, I did find that I preferred his short films to his longer works.  The feature films don't quite have the frantic pace to them that made the shorter films so memorable and enjoyable.  Of course, comparisons to his short movies a little unfair, as those shorts are rightly praised as some of the funniest sequences ever filmed.  But there are some incredible moments in his features as well as some strong movies.
But those shorts.  Wow.  Here are some of the most memorable movie scenes I have ever viewed.  Once seen, who can forget the literally hundreds of angry police officers chasing Keaton in COPS, or the prisoner bungee jumping from the end of a noose in CONVICT 13, or the DIY house being demolished by a train in ONE WEEK?  These films are fast-paced, surreal, bizarre and hilarious.  I loved them to pieces.
Prop comedy is something that is now horrifyingly associated with such painfully annoying clowns as Carrot Top (Lord help us).  But in the slapstick era, this was something that was not only funny, it could be downright diabolical.  I can only imagine how long it must have taken to construct the trap doors and false walls and other goodies that cropped up again and again.  Clever, inventive and strangely sophisticated, these physical implements, when combined with Keaton's formidable athletic abilities, produced some amazing and breathtaking scenes.
One of the things I would wonder to myself was not simply ""How on Earth did Keaton do that stunt?"", but ""How on Earth did Keaton survive that stunt?""  His accomplishments are made all the more impressive given that he was performing all of these aerobatics himself with little in the way of trick photography (decades later, Jackie Chan would work in much the same way to similar acclaim).
The major bonus in this set is the final DVD, KEATON PLUS, which contains all sorts of rarities and extras.  While the films here show Keaton in the 1920s, these extras focus on Keaton later in his career.  It's somewhat sad to see the great man reduced to doing cheesy commercials, but he's always at least watchable.  A few short excerpts from his 1950s TV series are included, and while it's fun to see that he could still take a pratfall thirty years on, I suspect that the thrust behind his return was the opportunity to make out with the incredibly tall and gorgeous model who appeared in virtually every clip.  Lucky old Buster; though after being teamed up with Jimmy Durante, that's the least that karma owed him.
I noticed that some reviewers have had negative things to say about the musical selections used as the soundtrack to these silent pictures.  My experience was quite different, as overall I enjoyed the music and was only occasionally annoyed by it.  On the other hand, you may wish to take what I say with a grain of salt, as I thought the James Bond musical riff in SHERLOCK, JR. was absolutely wonderful.
This was a great purchase, and during the perusal of this set, I felt I was not only seeing some great filmmaking, but a real splice of cinema history.  It's really a shame that Keaton's career went down the tubes after the 1920s, as I felt his features were gradually improving as he gained more experience.  His shorts (from the early part of the decade) were uniformly excellent, but I got the impression that he was gaining more useful experience in feature-length movies and developing as filmmaker.  It may be a bit depressing to know what happened after signing to MGM, but at least here we can enjoy the good times while they lasted.  And they certainly were good times and great films.",1085184000,126,4289,4.697860962566845
1652059,5,B00005QW5A,"This is a very good collection of the ""essentials"" of Keaton. One problem I have is that the bonus disk includes the complete ""Hard Luck"" (it adds back in the heretofore misplaced final gag), but the unrestored ""Hard Luck"" is on another disk.  While interesting to see how Kino overcame the problem of the unfound film (it describes the gag and shows a still), I would rather have had the restored ""Hard Luck"" on one disk and had some bonus disk space freed up for the entire ""This is Your Life"" program (which sounds interesting in Keaton bios).
The Thames TV/HBO Video three-parter ""A Hard Act to Follow"" has a better variety of rarities, including samplings of Keaton's final works (including Samuel Beckett's ""Film"", an industrial safety film, ""The Railrodder"", and some decent interviews and behind the scenes).
On the picky side, one of my brand new DVDs had a scuff on it.  I contacted Kino and they offered a replacement in return for the damaged disc, which I appreciate.  Many of the discs also had fingerprints on them, which they will contact their manufacturer about.  A small matter, perhaps, but the relatively high cost of this set and the reputation of Kino as a premier film reissue company means to me that such sloppiness should not be an issue.",1073779200,22,1265,4.736363636363636
1652060,5,B00005QW5A,"I don't disagree with the minor complaints of some of the other reviews of this Kino set of Buster Keaton's 1920s films. The music isn't always at the highest level. But generally its quite good, especially considering that most DVD reissues of silents are backed with a soundtrack performed on a synthesizer. I prefer a slightly out-of-tune but bona fide violin to a digital imitation of an orchestra. Also, these transfers have been around for a few years. Perhaps some of them could be improved upon.  I noticed that the more recent Image DVD issue of ""The General"" has a better image. Perhaps someday we'll get a new Keaton set with transfers to match the quality of Image Entertainment's the General.  But overall the image quality  of the current Kino set is very good to excellent.
Those caveats aside, I would put this collection (along with Image's box of the Chaplin Mutuals and Essanays) in the 'essential' category for silent movie fans.  Considering that a lot of movie classics are yet to see DVD issue, we are fortunate that Kino has put together such a comprehensive collection of Keaton's pre-MGM movies. Bogart fans will have to wait for the African Queen, but Keaton fans can enjoy these films right now. And unlike the Chaplin boxed set mentioned above, there's hardly a dud in the Keaton collection. Pretty much everything here will bring enjoyment over repeated viewings.  With Image Entertainment's wonderful Arbuckle/Keaton issue now readily available, all we need is The Cameraman and Spite Marriage! I'd love to see these films make it to DVD...",1072224000,30,1571,4.9356060606060606
1652061,5,B00005QW5A,"After spending years trying to catch up with Buster Keaton's various films from the 1920s, and often winding up with terrible picture quality, it almost seemed miraculous to view Kino's 11-disc dvd collection.  Many fine observations have already been made by other reviewers so I'll add something original.  One of the delights in viewing this collection [containing ALL his 1920s films except his last two features for MGM, The Cameraman (1928) and Spite Marriage (1929)] is comparing Keaton's own comments from various published biographies.
For my tastes, the films I liked best, such as SEVEN CHANCES, were those that Keaton seemed to like the least.  On the other hand, the ones Keaton remembered most fondly, such as THE NAVIGATOR, were a mixed bag to me.  I had seen THE GENERAL many times over the years, including on the big screen, but I think that Kino's version is the best looking of them all.
Keaton led a charmed life as an independent filmmaker throughout most of the 1920s.  Unlike Chaplin or Harold Lloyd who risked their own money in producing their films, Keaton never put up a dime to make his films.  A sympathetic producer, Joseph Schenck, who eventually became his father-in-law, financed Keaton's films until circumstances prevented him from doing so.  Then Keaton went to MGM - which is another controversy to be saved for the time, if ever, when the Buster Keaton MGM collection is issued.
The bonus disc is interesting for a number of reasons.  For me, it was curious to see Keaton's girlfriend from 1929's SPITE MARRIAGE play his leading lady in a 1934 short film for a small studio.  Apparently, they had both come a long way down by then.",1029110400,,1670,4.852112676056338
1652062,5,B00005QW5A,"The definitive buster collection. Buster was the great surrealist of the USA, facing the obstacles of life with a deapan look and amazing athleticism. By far the greatest comedian in cinema.

1652063,5,B00005QW5A,"If you are reading this, then you are probably already a Keaton fan. I don't need to tell you about the constant innovation, the incredible stunts, the bizarre sight gags, and the invariable dream sequences that are a part of Keaton's work.
This set is quite nice. The bonus disc has some interesting material in it, though I wonder if it is worth buying the set for it.
There are occasional moments of digital artifacting, mostly noticable on the title cards, which are varying shades of gray, which seems to be the easiest way to guarantee artifacting.
The copies of almost all the films are superb, and the newly discovered ending to Hard Luck is a riot.
But, of course, any Keaton fan will buy this set. If you are not a Keaton fan, well, try renting a film of his first before you take the plunge. Try SHerlock Jr., One Week, The General, Steamboat Bill Jr., or even The Navigator.",1012089600,47,886,4.509316770186335
1652064,4,B00005QW5A,"The 11-disc set of Buster Keaton's work is, of course, a must-have for Mr. Keaton's fans in particular and silent film fans in general (sorry..). Having all these wonderful films on DVD is truly a dream come true.
That being said, I must point out one or two things with which I was disappointed. The set is said to be ""digitally mastered from archival prints"". Then why are there so many sections of film that are in such poor condition? While digital technology cannot replace lost film, even on my home computer I can touch-up photographs; surely a film restoration company should have better and more extensive resources at its disposal. Another sore spot is the scoring. I have been spoiled by a brilliant musician who plays at the Silent Movie Theatre here in Los Angeles, Dean Mora. He is the perfect accompanist for silent films. Some of the scoring for the DVD set is, forgive me, atrocious. The worst offense is the use of the James Bond theme for one part of SHERLOCK, JR. Of only slightly less heinous nature is the use of thematic elements from other (read ""future"") time periods. I may sound like an old fogey (I'm 43), but I think that a piano is fine, a violin and maybe one or two other chamber pieces sufficient. I am not averse to full orchestration, but music choice and coordination with the film is paramount. Musical cues should reflect on-screen action. One last point; sound effects are not needed.
Even with the flaws, I say: buy this set. It's wonderful to have Mr. Keaton in your home.",1009670400,64,1513,4.607407407407408
1652065,1,B00005QW5A,"First things first: I am a huge fan of Keaton, and every film student should have his films in their collection. UNFORTUNATELY, my praise is far from effusive for Kino. The movies in this box set have been available individually for well over a year. I was reticent to get the DVD's in the first place since I ponied up the big bucks when it first came out on Laserdisc many years ago. Last summer, I caved in and started buying the individual DVD's, which cost over $25 brand new per DVD. While this box set will be of financial comfort to those who decided to wait, it's just thumbscrews to the fans who already plunked down their hard cash for it. Yes, they do include a bonus disk that every Keatonphile craves, but all the true Keatonphiles already have the other DVD's. Why make the loyal purchasers pay through the nose again? Kino should offer the bonus disc individually, so everybody can get a taste of its masterworks. Will I give in again to Kino, and buy this set? Don't bet on it. I've shown my fandom by paying big for Keaton discs twice in my life already. Paying for the same stuff a third time would be irrational, and I believe there's a difference between fandom and fanaticism.",1009411200,24,1198,4.45

7951273,5,B00005QW5A,"I wish I had the money to buy this set all at once instead of disc by disc.  I was able to complete it eventually.  Buster Keaton is simply amazing!  Perfect comedic timing, surprising gags, unbelievable stunts and acrobatics, and he would produce, direct and write.

This huge collection has eleven discs and covers most of his career throughout the 1920s.  Buster was known as The Great Stone Face because he used just his eyes to convey emotions to the audience.  No smiling or frowning from him.  His porkpie hat, slap shoes, and clip on tie are his trademarks.  Ten features, 19 shorts and one film fits somewhere in between.  All are comedies.  One bonus disc of 1930s shorts, TV appearances, commercials, recently discovered footage, and more.

This set blew me away.  Keatons work holds up so much better than Charlie Chaplins.  None of these movies seem dated.  A couple have some quality problems because of their age but noting to interfere with one enjoying the movies.  The music fits well and the opening scenes of Seven Chances are in two-strip Technicolor.

The General has earned its share of accolades but is not my favorite.  Steamboat Bill, Jr., The Navigator and College are the best features.  The Balloonatic, Neighbors, The High Sign, and The Playhouse, where Buster plays two dozen different people and a monkey, are the best shorts.  I cant heap enough praise on this collection.  I highly recommend this anthology for everybody.",1415318400,,1455,4.885245901639344
