841317,5,6304301235,"Although deemed a ""movie,"" The Last Shout is more or less two episodes of the hilarios BBC comedy Absolutely Fabulous.  After only 18 episodes the creator of this masterpiece, Jennifer Saunders, called it  quits.  I often wonder if it was a career mistake for Miss Saunders,  however, AbFab will live forever.
This 1996 ""movie"" picks up  where the last episode entitled 'The End' left off.  Eddie and Patsy go off  on a skiing trip where Eddie comes face to face with God (in this case a  rather stunningly beautiful Marianne Faithful in an equally stunning  electric blue suit).  God tells Eddie it is not her turn and she has much  more to do.  And that she does as Saffie is planning a wedding to Paolo.
The second part of the episode centers around the planning and execution  of this wedding.  As always, it leaves you breathless.
The great thing  about AbFab is that you can watch them over and over and never really get  tired of them.  Comedy hasn't been quite the same without the fresh airing  of new episodes.  We can only hope for a reunion.  Ebay and other online  auctions always seem to have AbFab merchandise, some are getting rather  pricey as they are out-of-print and are becoming quite rare.  So if you  haven't got on the AbFab train, perhaps you should think about it...Sweetie  darling, it's absolutley fabulous!",952300800,12,1335,4.675324675324675
841318,5,6304301235,"Being a devoted Ab Fab fan from the beginning I greeted the news of a new movie with elation as well as a little reservation. Many a time has a great little show been ruined by the move to the big screen. Not so in this case however. Without doubt the best thing to come from the U.K. since Monty Python's Flying Circus! This video combines the wayward charm of the original series' with a completely new and refreshing exploration of the London lite. It is perhaps true to say that a prior knowledge of the life's and personalities of the characters is required to fully appreciate the films quirky brilliance. To those that have already been indoctinated into the Saudersesque cult though, this is clearly the pinnacle, defining Absolutely Fabulous episode. If you haven't seen this one yet, get moving because you don't know what you're missing!  END",880761600,,853,4.724832214765101

""The Last Shout"" begins with Edina floating with a dolphin in a pool located in her bedroom for spiritual cleansing.  She contacts Patsy, who has been renting an apartment conveniently located above a liquor store, to get ready for her job interview.  Patsy does get up, but only so far as to walk into a pub.
Meanwhile, Saffron anxiously awaits the arrival of her new boyfriend, Paulo Carlo.  When he does, Saffron brings him into the kitchen and shortly thereafter, Patsy arrives since she and Edina are going off to Edina's office.  Edina & Patsy argue with Saffron in the kitchen, but Paulo asks them to be quiet since he's reading and waiting for Saffron to make his espresso.  Edina & Patsy take notice and decide to leave.  Saffron spills the espresso on Paulo's shirt and offers to clean it for him.  While cleaning it, she & Paulo share their differing views of women.  During their debate, Paulo asks Saffron to marry him and she immediately accepts!
Edina and Patsy return home to prepare to leave for a ski trip to Val D'Isere in the French Alps.  There, they find Saffron with her father (to Edina's delight).  Saffron tells Edina that she's getting married and Edina nearly passes out.  She & Patsy continue preparing for their ski trip and leave.
At Val D'Isere, Edina has a near-fatal ski accident and meets God, who turns out to be Marianne Faithful.  God tells her that it's not her time yet to die.  She & Patsy return home to begin preparations for Saffron's wedding where they find a noisy RV parked in their walkway.  (Edina's mother has been entertaining some elderly friends from the USA.)
Will Saffron marry Paulo?  Will Edina's mother & her elderly friends drive Edina crazy?  You'll just have to watch this hilarious two-part episode to find out!",1028764800,2,1925,4.684523809523809
7867797,5,6304301235,"I love this video.  I laughed till I cried then laughed some more!!  Sweetie, darlin' Edina will never be the son of God but deep down inside theres an angel, and ""yes just the one dears!""  Well worth the money if you are a true ab fab fan...what are you waiting for?",1011312000,,267,4.096153846153846
7867798,3,6304301235,Not as edgy as the rest of the series.  I couldn't get into the subplot about Saffron being engaged to some rich guy.  Actually the last episode in series three was a more fitting epitaph (even though there are newer episodes now).,1008806400,,231,4.476190476190476
7867799,5,6304301235,"Ab Fab is probably the most hilarious show I've ever had the chance to watch. With this last video, celebrate Ed's and Pat's departure by buying a nice bottle of champ', two packs of cigs, dress up, put on tge tape, and enjoy with a crazy friend: the experience is worth trying! You'll soon behave like the two fab brit girls, will neverendlessly laugh, and... that's what life is made for, right, darling?",974246400,,406,4.575342465753424
7867800,5,6304301235,"Just when you thought you'd never laugh that hard ever again, Eddie and Patsy are at it one last time, with Saffy about to walk down the aisle in desperation, Patsy homeless (these scenes are hilarious), and Eddie about to meet God. Without the almost-innocent quality of the original series, the laughs are still fresh, and the relationship between the two is as strong as ever. The ending is fun, too -- the real ending and also the fact that the producers threw in a few outtakes. I'm glad I got this one. It makes a nice closure to the series.",972691200,4,547,4.425742574257426
7867801,3,6304301235,"""~With the legendary ""Monty Python: The Holy Grail"" and a few skits from the "" Benny Hill Show"" as exceptions, I find British Comedy to be stale. good as the series. Edina and Patsy were thier  usual bitchy, haughty, overindulgent, loveable selves.  Those two will  always have a special place in my heart, but Grand's clique of old folks  annoyed the hell out of me and were totally unwatchable.  The movie was  good as long as you got the old fast forward button working whenever the  old folks appear. But what broke my heart the most is that Edina's  airheaded secretary, Bubble, was not in this one!  How dare they do this!  Overall, this movie was okay, but I would recommend to viewers to check out  the regular series for AbFab's best work.",952992000,2,748,4.548872180451128
