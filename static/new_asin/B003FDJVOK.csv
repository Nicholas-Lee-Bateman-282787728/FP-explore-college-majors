I thought my core was strong but If you can keep up with Kloey on the DVD you will be ripped!!! Super intense full body workout, in 3 weeks of use 4 times a week I already feel a difference in my strength and flexibility. No matter what level of athlete this video will put your core to the test. I LOVE it!!!!",1274832000,2,436,3.965909090909091
8463228,5,B003FDJVOK,Challenging moves which allow room to advance which is rare in the DVD format. Kloey gives great verbal guidance to ensure that you are doing the movements correctly without having to look at the screen as is the case with some other DVDs out there. Can't wait for the next DVD!,1274745600,,278,4.470588235294118
8463229,4,B003FDJVOK,"Great video if you've done some pilates before. Basic and advanced moves. Also, great ball workout. Video is faster paced than the rather annoying instructional types, as there is an explanation of the basic concepts of the exercises in the beginning that you can skip over once you've seen them. Great video, looking forward to future videos by this instructor! Also, fast shipping.",1274313600,,383,5.095238095238095
8463230,5,B003FDJVOK,"This is the most amazing exercise DVD I have ever experienced. The results that I have seen in a short amount of time are incredible.
The progressive concepts are easy to follow, and Kloey's clear and creative instruction make it easy for the viewer to tailor a workout that fits his/her personal strength and flexibility needs.

This DVD will definitely shake up your fitness routine!",1271289600,,385,4.923076923076923
