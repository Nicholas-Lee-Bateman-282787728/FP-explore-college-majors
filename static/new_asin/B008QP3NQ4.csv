5178501,5,B008QP3NQ4,"When Scott and Bailey first debuted in the middle of last year it was like a breath of fresh air. A lot of police procedural type programmes almost merge into one, but this one was sufficiently novel to make it memorable. Most viewers were hoping for a second series and happily we did not have long to wait. This time round we have the bonus of eight episodes rather than the six from the first series.

Janet Scott and Rachael Bailey are two overworked detectives from the Major Incident Team of the Manchester Metropolitan Police in the UK. The format is that we learn a lot about Janet and Rachael in their personal lives and there is as much emphasis on this aspect as on the cases they are working on. For example in the first episode Rachael's hitherto unknown (by us) brother descends on her and we quickly find out that he is a convicted armed robber, which certainly complicates her life. Janet, newly recovered from the serious stab wounds she received in Series 1, has her mother staying with her for three months whilst recovering from an operation. This quickly causes major tensions with her husband and two daughters. Meanwhile the crimes they are investigating are interesting well thought out stories, arguably darker than Series 1. The combination of the professional and the personal make for compulsive viewing and this continues throughout the second series.

A lot of the strength of Scott and Bailey lies in the interaction between Janet and Rachael. Although best friends, it is a far from totally harmonious relationship. Janet is the older, steadier character, whilst Rachael is a little more unpredictable, but is usually the one who manages the inspirational leaps of imagination which is what gets the cases solved. She is also rather more non conformist which tends to put her in conflict with their boss, DI Gill Murray, who again is an excellent foil for the two DCs. It is fair comment that none of the men are in the least impressive, however, I think the three main women in this series more than make up for this, so personally I did not find it an issue.

The series finishes on a very tense and emotional note as the personal and professional aspects of one of the ladies' lives collide in a most dramatic fashion and her loyalties are tested to extremes. It was pleasing that we were not left with a ridiculous cliffhanger at the end, as this always seems so contrived. I am certainly looking forward to the Series 3 without requiring this sort of incentive!

A lot of the credit for the success of this show is the contribution of the two leads, Lesley Sharpe and Suranne Jones. However, Amelia Bullmore who plays DI Murray also puts in a very strong performance and really carries equal weight with the other two especially latterly. Clearly this is a successful formula and hopefully we can look forward to Scott and Bailey becoming an established part of our TV viewing in the future.",1379980800,43,2928,4.712890625

I get it, she's a damaged person.  But enough, already.  And pairing her with the cop-husband doesn't work; no Rachel I know for fall for this man-child.  Finally, as in all detective series, the story arc is far too familiar.  Dead body, CCTV evidence, interviews, red herrings, and the quick resolution of the guilty person minutes before time runs out.  I'll finish season 2, and move on.",1465948800,,547,4.75531914893617

5178564,5,B008QP3NQ4,"An extremely well put-together ""detective saga"" (of which there are no shortage - particularly British and ""Down-Under""). Janet and Rachel are an excellently matched set of investigators with amusingly diametrically-opposed personalities. Boss DCI Gill is also excellent. Their habit of taking case stories and partially weaving them together (happens even more during season 3) keeps the viewer on his/her toes - as either Janet or Rachel is apt to refer to more than one case (or personal situation) inside a single sentence of chatter. The one area where I would drop the overall rating by a 1/2 star is the script-writers portrayal (in general) of males in the scenarios. There is a clear tendency to either ""dumb"" them down (e.g. - DC Kevin) or give them a blatant flaw (e.g. - Gill's ex-husband) well beyond what would seem a ""normal"" distribution of personalities. I believe that the principal ladies in the story can hold their own just fine without the need to down-cast so many of the men. Overall, however, I believe the whole presentation (particularly its ""people"") stays well within the bounds of belief, something that the great majority of Hollywood counterparts have trouble with (the need for an endless stream of ""pretty people"").",1454112000,,1249,5.097560975609756
5178565,5,B008QP3NQ4,"Wonderful series!! Loved the characters, and the story lines......hope there are several more series.",1453507200,,101,6.285714285714286
5178566,1,B008QP3NQ4,"Season 1 was ok, so we decided to get season 2.  The whole season is about their lives falling apart.  Rachel is obviously an extreme alcoholic, but nobody points it out to her.  And only the chief lady can figure out what's going on.  Won't order any more.",1452124800,,257,4.291666666666667
5178567,5,B008QP3NQ4,"Love this series! This is like Cagney and Lacy in England. Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey are British cops working major crimes in Manchester. Janet is older, has a family and has seniority in the office, while Rachel is younger, comes from a poor & dysfunctional family and makes rash decisions. There are crimes to solve, relationships to be sorted out at home, office relationships, careers.  Sometimes the police work comes second to their personal lives is season 2, or at least more than in season 1, in my opinion. I binged this and totally enjoyed it.",1449619200,,558,4.752577319587629
5178568,5,B008QP3NQ4,Keep renewing this quality program.  Amazing dialogue and realistic plot twists in light of their lives as working women.,1449446400,,121,5.368421052631579
5178569,4,B008QP3NQ4,An interesting drama.,1448496000,,21,6.333333333333333
5178570,5,B008QP3NQ4,"Season Two of Scott & Bailey continues to achieve the level of quality of season one.  The good news: there are eight episodes in season two, two more than in season one.  Most of the writing is still done by Sally Wainwright, though Amelia Bullmore, the actress who plays Gill Murray, writes one of the episodes.  Any tinkering with the direction and writing is, however, seamless.  The cinematography and set designs remain strong and the acting is very special.  The continuing B story concerns Rachels brother, Dom, a decent but dim neer-do-well who has just served four years in prison and comes to live with his (slightly) older sister.

What sets apart Scott & Bailey from other procedurals (besides the ongoing attention given to the principal characters personal lives) is the technique of interrogation.  One of the series prime accomplishments is its ability to show very slowly-paced interrogations in a riveting manner.  Sometimes there are outbursts, but most of the time Janet or Rachel ask questions very slowly.  There are long pauses and, sometimes, unending responses from the perps of No Comment.  This could easily become tedious but while it sometimes skates toward the edge, in the majority of cases we see the questioner quietly build a web from which there is no escape.  In one of the episodes there is what Suranne Jones (Rachel) calls a Starsky and Hutch moment in which she throws a perp across the hood of a car and wrestles him to the ground.  (This is in the behind the scenes additional material.)  The actors all live for those action/adventure physical scenes, but they are like icing on the cake in the series.  The heart of the matter is the intellection and it is done superbly.

Season two lives up to the expectations set by season one.  Dont miss either of them.",1448409600,,1803,4.824104234527687

5178574,5,B008QP3NQ4,"I wish I was a writer so I could give this show a proper review because it's really fabulous.  The things I enjoy about it?  Being a cop show, you would expect the cases to be interesting.  And they are, but the real gold of this show is the characters who are flawed, complex, and wonderful - you really fall in love with them and become immensely interested in their lives.  The writing is superb and the dialogue is extremely well done - fabulous, actually, (some of the dialogue is so good it's worth listening to more than once).  I think the producers did a great job with casting.  Every actor and actress is absolutely perfect for their role.

It is one of my ultimate favorite shows.  In fact, I am completely addicted  - have told all of my friends and loved ones about it - and hope Season Four isn't too far in the future.  I don't know if I can wait!",1445904000,,863,4.2392638036809815

5178617,5,B008QP3NQ4,"Excellent portrayals of 3 dynamic, troubled crime-solving UK police women. Murders are graphic, stories credible in these salacious and predatory times. 'Gil' is punctilious and mesmerizing in her murder briefings  and Janet and Rachel in turn evoke my frustration, shock and pathos in juggling their personal and professional lives while trying to keep their passions in check.  While I love Prime Suspect's Jane Tennison, Scott & Bailey is ensemble acting at its tension-filled best.  Purchased seasons 1,2 and 3; can't wait for US format for season 4.

5178644,5,B008QP3NQ4,"This is a great series.  Yes, the characters are flawed in the lives, but they work well together in and out of the office.  I began watching it in the middle of the second season on PBS and decided that I had to see it from the beginning and could not wait.  I bought seasons one and two, and I am not disappointed in my purchases.

Also, I have decided that Sally Wainwright is my new girlfriend even though she killed ****.  I want to go by her house and hang out and drink wine so that I can ask her about her upcoming projects and the next seasons of the shows she produces.

5178652,5,B008QP3NQ4,"This is a very enjoyable UK police tv series about two women cops. The one who plays the older cop, Janet the blonde, is the more stable of the two. She is also excellent at all aspects of talking to people in police work. Her partner, Rachel, the brunette, is younger and has come out of a much more unstable background. Rachel's family is a complete mess whereas Janet's tries to be supportive. They both have problems with marriage and men though and this is true of police people in general. That they are women does not spare them from these problems happening to them. Rachel is the more instinctively brilliant of the two. She will often come up with the ""who did it"" on a crime when no one else on the squad is even close to figuring it out. They also have a woman boss who gives new meaning to the phrase ""no nonsense"" and ""tough as nails."" The individual cases are very interesting and well written. However, this show is made by the quality of the actors which is true of almost all of these series. In the UK this series is much further along. They just concluded showing eight episodes of season 4 in Fall of 2014. The show keeps its quality so now is the time to pick it up since they are now being issued for the United States.",1420848000,,1242,4.2893617021276595
5178653,5,B008QP3NQ4,"This UK series never disappoints. It just gets better and better and is never predictable. The writing and acting are top-notch. I thoroughly enjoy the three main actresses and their characters, strong and capable women with flaws that make them seem very real. In addition to the actresses who play the main characters, the supporting cast and their characters are fascinating too. This is the best cop show I have seen in many years. I am hooked!",1420761600,,448,4.8311688311688314

5178673,5,B008QP3NQ4,A very good series with predictably damaged detectives. The squad is unique enough and the cases are pretty fresh and not just a rehashing of other previous series. You will feel for them but only like them on occasion (some not so much). I used these as examples of how to write good characters in a First Year Writing Seminar. They were well received and the characters produced great class discussions.,1417132800,,405,4.71830985915493

Then the second disc started midway thru an episode, with no beginning. It only lasted 20-25 minutes. I had seen this episode on TV so, in addition to it being too short I knew beginning was missing. Have no clue why this happened but I really think I should be able to return for a complete one as that's what I paid for. Looks like there may be problems with quality controls. May cost a little more thru Acorn or BBC but at least you'd get the full versions I would hope. Otherwise I would give it five stars. I like the show that much!",1411257600,,721,4.1571428571428575

Once I got the DVDs for both series, I binged them eagerly, and have watched them many, many times since, each time picking up on a subtle nuance in the story telling and performances with each viewing.  How delightful to have a program that shows women working together without falling into stereotypes.  And the male characters are just as much of a mess as the women characters for a change, too.  Very well written and well acted.  In particular, I like that there is a case per episode, with another case that is followed over the course of the entire series.  If you want series 2, you can wait for amazon to get it, which may take months, or go to the PBS website, where it is available now.

My only question now is:  WHERE IS SERIES 3???",1407024000,4,1046,4.285714285714286

8529764,3,B008QP3NQ4,"The quality of the content of this show is magnificent. The plots are compelling, the acting is sensitive yet strong and full of complexity. The directing is superb. There is nothing not to like about this series. However, one would have to be brain dead not to ""get"" the underlying agenda of the entire series. As much as I like this program, and I do, I despise entirely its feminist assumptions. Almost without exception, the men are simpering idiots, perverted psychopaths, or pathetic nutters with the emotional presence of a 10 year old. The regular female characters, on the other hand, are all strong, bright, professionally focused and delightfully complex. The men are flat, entirely sexual, and morally diminished. The moral failures and foolish mistakes in judgement by the women can are sympathetically understandable and in some sense inevitable. Those by the men however, are always reflective of their fundamentally deficient character and one is led to believe that there isn't much else about them worth knowing. In my view this represent not only the artistic choices of the writers but also their persistent worldview and evidence of their social agenda. So I will watch the entire series, enjoy it greatly, and at the same time fundamentally reject the flawed, destructive, inaccurate and offensive feminist agenda that seeks to diminish all men in order to elevate women in general. I will watch it all because I like the show and the characters, all the while secure in knowing that not all men are pathetic and not all women are like Scott & Bailey, even if some, most definitely, are.",1529020800,,1609,4.985130111524164

8529766,4,B008QP3NQ4,"I think the writing reveals more about the writer than plausible crimes in society. And, it's weird to have such poisonous antiheroes as the protagonists in a TV series. They coldly manipulate people with barely a pretense of honest integrity, even their partners. Their boss, Godzilla, is the only positive female character. The male characters are dullards... muscle, incompetent pretty boys, or yesmen.",1517443200,,405,5.444444444444445

8529770,5,B008QP3NQ4,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, she drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring, and it seems separation is the name of the game. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 2, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim. Scott and Bailey work as a team most of the time, but they have their differences. Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes not to be called into DCI Gill Murray'S office. Didcipline and excellent police work is the word if the day- good series.
