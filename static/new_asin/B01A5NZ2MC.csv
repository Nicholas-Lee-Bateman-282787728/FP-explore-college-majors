7588289,5,B01A5NZ2MC,This is a wonderful movie about overcoming adversity.  Great story very well acted!,1462492800,,83,5.384615384615385
7588290,5,B01A5NZ2MC,This was a wonderful movie!  I watched it with my 11 year old daughter and she enjoyed it as much as I did.  It's not often (never?) that you can watch a movie with subtitles for Spanish and Japanese.,1462492800,,200,4.102564102564102
7588291,5,B01A5NZ2MC,My wife and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  Diane Elizabeth Torres was very good.  Both she and director/writer Anthony Lucero are new to us and we are looking forward to more from both of them.  This is a movie that I expect to watch several times.  We wanted the film to keep going because the characters were so engaging.,1462492800,9,325,4.4576271186440675
7588292,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"What a delightful film!  I'm from Oakland where this was filmed and loved seeing my city as the backdrop to a wonderful story  I saw it it 3 times and even had the pleasure of meeting the director Anthony Lucero and some of the stars, Diana Elizabeth Torres included, many who are local to this area.  This film was made with love.  Everyone I urged to see it for themselves were equally charmed by it.  It deserves all the independent awards it has received so far.  I'm buying it to keep and give as gifts!",1462233600,7,508,4.294736842105263
7588293,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"There are food-related films which concentrate on a type of food. Theres a few about chocolate, a lot about Italian chefs and now we have Mexican-sushi film. This one really was a terrific treasure that Im pretty sure did not play the big screens around the country  and if so, it left quickly.

If youve read my other reviews on Amazon, youll know that Im not a fan of spoilers and you won't find any here. In fact, I recommend that you read as little as possible about the film except to know that its a charming film about a Mexican single mother who lives with her father and young daughter in Oakland California and who wants to be a self-supporting chef. When father and daughter speak it is in Spanish but the English subtitles are VERY easy to read).  The food photography is just an added bonus to a great script by writer/director Anthony Lucero (in his directorial debut).
The lead actress, Diana Elizabeth Torres is amazing and I look forward to seeing more of her in the future.

The DVD has three bonuses: The first is two deleted scenes, which only last a few minutes. Then there are two featurettes One is the behind the scenes and another is behind the music. Together they run 17 minutes and, unlike many similar ones that are filled by repeating scenes from the film, these really add to the enjoyment. (But watch AFTER seeing the film.

So, I won't go on any longer. The package shows the accolades the film got from 12 different film festivals. All well-deserved!

By the way, there is no graphic language or sex. It is rated PG for a small (necessary) scene of a fight. I would still rate this a family friendly movie for children over 10 years old to watch with their parents.

This is a film Ill be recommending to all my friends.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

It has won numerous awards, like Audience Favorite, at many film festivals. Charming, wonderful movie! Really deserved a wider, national/international  distribution. Hope that still happens.

If you like films about food and people, don't miss it. A superb empowerment story with a stand up and cheer impact though the ending is not the formula you might expect. And Diana Torres deserves to be a star.

If you can see it in a public screening, lucky you. Otherwise this is worth buying as you will show it to friends and family for sure.\",1457308800,15,494,4.311827956989247

7588306,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"This movie was probably too low-key and uneventful to be a hit.  It's a wonderful story, though, about a young Latino mother named Juana, with a young daughter to support, who gets a job at a Japanese restaurant.  Not only is she an exceptional worker, she becomes intrigued by Japanese food, particularly sushi, and soon longs to be a sushi chef.  She has two huge strikes against her, however--she's a female and she has not been traditionally trained to make sushi.  (And those are the two main reasons, not that she is Latino, as she implies in a rant directed at the restaurant owner. A Japanese woman would have been considered just as unacceptable.)

In an effort to show she would be a good sushi chef, Juana enters a local televised sushi creation contest.  (The emcee is sort of weird and makes the contest seem sort of weird.)  While this movie has a predictable type of ending, it is still well worth watching to see how Juana works so hard to get ahead in life; to see how she interacts with her daughter and her loving father, who amusingly does not want to eat Japanese food, but Mexican; and to see all that goes on in the Japanese restaurant, including her friendship with sushi chef Aki.",1531094400,,1205,4.550925925925926

The authentic family dynamics, sweet friendship between the main character and head sushi chef, and the ""go for your dreams"" message had me hooked.

To filmmakers out there, make more movies like this and I will pay money to see them.

7588319,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"Juana and her father run a fruit cart on the streets of Los Angeles - but she yearns for more. She knows she's a good cook, but she wants something more than working at ""just another taco joint"". After getting robbed of her day's earnings at her cart, she goes looking for a new job, one that will provide her security and more reliable income than the cart, and lands a general-kitchen help position with a sushi restaurant. Sushi is a new cuisine for her, but one she quickly falls in love with, and she wants to become a sushi chef. But it's going to be an uphill battle for her to become one, as she is told that women do not make good sushi chefs.

'East Side Sushi' is a tale that will warm the heart and inspire you. It's about following your dreams and not letting others tell you ""no"" or ""you can't"". And it's about the American dream of setting the bar high for yourself, and working hard to reach it.",1527552000,,911,4.235632183908046

2014

Not the East Side of NYC, but Oakland, CA!  Director Anthony Lucero (also credited as writer) using the ever popular Japanese movie plot of ""zero-to-hero"" conjures up a cross-cultural tale focused on the art of creating gourmet masterpieces using just about anything shored up by vinegared (sticky) rice.  With sticky rice as a metaphor, Lucero goes after tribalism, bigotry, racism, sexism, and phony cultural authenticity in the restaurant business using a light touch with a minimum of lecturing.  This proves to be a very effective approach (with a few less-than-subtitle messages tucked in here and there!).  A Mexican-American single mother with a young daughter living with her widowed semi-retired and ailing father decides to refocus her life on moving up the socioeconomic ladder from fruit pushcart street vendor to becoming a renown suchi-bar chef.  Lead actress Diana Elizabeth Torres seems perfectly cast as a strong woman determined to prevail against a myriad of antiquated male attitudes (including her father's) although her character's credibility suffers somewhat when the Director allows her to ham it up in confrontational scenes.  Actress Kaya Jade Aguirre playing the daughter steals every scene she is in (which is customary for child players!).  Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) is excellent especially for hand shots of food preparation.  Lighting and color correction are fine as is sound.  Score is uneven (sometimes in the background, sometimes nearly drowning out the dialog) and over doses on taiko (drums).  Subtitles are okay.  Closing-credits song lyrics are not translated.  An enjoyable feel-good fantasy.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

What I also enjoyed about this movie is that I learned how to make sushi rice (eight part vinegar, 4 part sugar, 1 part sea salt, and mix rice at 45 degree angle with the spatula to ensure all rice is evenly mixed), and I learned how to tell if a fish is of good quality (should not leave an impression after you press down on the skin, the eyes should not be cloudy, the under side of the gills should not be dark red, and fins should not be broken).

7588353,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"This was a really cute movie. It is very honest and real to life and the industry. After living in LA for nearly eight years I can honestly say I've seen the melting pot of traditions and hybrids in pretty much all cuisine. Understandably in America these things can actually happen and do more often than not. I've been to a few sushi establishments in LA where women have been in the front and I've never even thought twice about it. Good well done sushi is good sushi. In LA many Japanese sushi restaurants are run by Koreans anyways, and it's not always good. Making sushi properly definitely takes skill and creativity and not just anyone should be making it in a restaurant. There is something to be valued with tradition and culture in the world, too many don't pay any attention. Some traditions could easily be done without, yet it's always good to remember and pay respects when respect is due. I believe cultural awareness is important, and definitely when it comes to culinary fare.

I enjoyed the cultural contrast of this movie between tradition and non, along with the struggles which are real for so many. I watch a lot of cooking shows and competitions, she puts up a good fight. Nice little film.",1523577600,2,1214,4.62037037037037

7588360,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"The moral of this movie is powerful: people facing severe financial and social problems need not succumb. Juana Martinez, in this movie, recognizes that she must secure a professional-type job in order earn enough money to care for her young daughter and her (soon to be elderly) father; she seeks a profession, finds it (become a professional sushi chef), figures out a plan to achieve the goal, then pursues it relentlessly.  She faces sexist and racist traditions but is able to overcome them by being better than the competition.  She does not fall prey to typical distractions - find a man/husband to help her out; waste her time and money socializing; seek a quick fix, etc.  She prepares herself as any professional would; she seeks excellence through practice, observation, analysis, etc.  She prevails.  As Siddhartha in Hesse's novel, she pursues her goal like a stone falling through water - no lateral diversion to distract the stone's path.  I showed this movie to a group of inmates; they agreed that the message is a powerful one - use the power of one's character/personality to persevere, to focus, to define, to consciously articulate and to achieve goals.",1522972800,,1174,4.994871794871795

7588364,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"Outstanding! This movie shows the bitterness of Japanese tradition yet needs to be acknowledged some day. I, as a Japanese male who grew up in Japan for 21 years, truly enjoyed this movie for every single second. This movie explains how difficult non-Japanese to get to know our culture in depth, and Japanese would like to keep our ""pure"" traditions. Every culture and ethnicity hinders you to fully enter other societies, especially if you do not resemble to the race you would like to enter or does not speak its native language, but Juana from this movie gave me a lot of hope to keep myself trying hard for what I am passion about. I completely agreed with Juana, and when cultures and dishes travel to other countries, they need to be adjusted to the local. When I moved to CA from Japan, I always had thought of sushi in US are not good enough or never defeat our motherland sushi, but it is not true at all.

7588380,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"First, for those that did not like this movie, at the time I write this, I think there are 9 reviews with only 1 star?  Really?  There was no agenda with this film, no hidden messages, no cultural warfare.  Oh, and if you only speak English and hate subtitles, then this movie is not for you, really?  My high school Spanish was good enough to understand the few lines in Spanish.  My few words of Japanese, I have learned watching Japanese Anime, was sufficient to understand what little was in Japanese as well.  Is the acting perfect, no, but the unpolished nature of the actors, adds to the depth and realistic tone, rather than the highly polished, slick acting we see all the time.  So, is this a big budget film, no.  But is it straight forward, yes.  The plot is simple, it is a mother, with talent, learning how and why she wants to be a chef, the twist is that she steps into another world, new to her, that is it, that is the plot.  Anyone, that understands the soul and heart of America, the United States at its best, it is when someone, anyone, chases their dream, and never gives up.  This movie excels in this regard.",1521504000,,1133,4.347619047619047

I felt that this movie was enjoyable, perhaps a bit predictable, but seriously, its level of drama made watching it less about intensity, and more about perseverance.  I appreciated Juana's tenacity, and eagerness to learn and go after what she wanted. I do love food movies, and sushi, so this one was a 5 star for me.  I also loved Chef, and watched it with my son, so I will probably share this one with him as well.  Family friendly for sure.

7588404,5,B01A5NZ2MC,Can't say I agree that this is anything but Fairy Tale-esque but a wonderful film none-the-less. Wonderfully acted even if the story is unremarkable.  We do need more stories of the American Dream even if it is still just a dream.,1520208000,,230,4.609756097560975
7588405,1,B01A5NZ2MC,"Acting was ok.  Some of the cultural parts were a bit cringe worthy to watch.  I had to laugh when the sushi chef told her to mix the wasabi into the soy sauce.  That's the Americanized way you eat sushi, and the chef who's supposedly Japanese, should've known better.  This made the character unrealistic to me.  The writers should've invested more time in really really learning about the Japanese culture more, instead of writing it from what seems to be a clueless point of view, and passing it off.  Wanted to keep an open mind  but the ignorance laced throughout was kind of irritating.",1520208000,,592,4.634615384615385

Where were all the f-words? Nowhere to be found, this movie simply didn't need them to project emotions or reactions. It's just a really great story with very engaging, absolutely believable characters. I particularly liked the cross-over food themes that demonstrated how ordinary people (particularly the skeptical child plus grumpy Dad in the beginning and middle) can learn to open their minds via their taste buds. And I guess the traditional business man certainly learned a thing or two about what authenticity can be in the process, depending on where the market is and who the buyers really are standing by to judge. As stated above, the characters suck you into their world, excellent acting with an exceptionally strong story. Bravo!",1520121600,,1102,5.375722543352601

The movie started out pretty slow, and I thought it would pick up, but it just stays at a mediocre pace. The cheesy dramatic music that led me to think of polynesianesque war music did not help the film in my mind.

The acting was mediocre at best, but the story line is wholesome and somewhat uplifting. I would not spend an hour and a half of my time to watch this unless I had absolutely nothing else to do. Watch at your own risk.",1518393600,,520,4.19

This film initially attempts to paint the strong latina female lead as someone completely ignorant of the Japanese culture. It appears to completely erase the massive influence that Japanese culture has garnered over the past 20 years. At a later point in the film, we are met with the same struggle to paint an adult Japanese man living in Los Angeles as having  no knowledge of Mexican culture.

There's a hint of what might be a budding romance, but they didn't try to force it. When the script falters, the acting holds it up, and vice versa. The main characters (Juana and Aki) make the whole thing come together. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but I'm bumping it to 4 because it was so charming and fun. These characters work hard, and the film doesn't make light of that -- but it leaves room for joy, too. That's a great combination.",1516320000,,544,4.29126213592233

At it's core, it's about people embracing uncomfortable situations (new jobs, new foods, new cultures) and how we can get along.  It sounds corny as I type it, but I love how Anthony Lucero never wavered from the feelings of discomfort, even as he highlighted the courage and compassion of characters that can overcome it.  Juana's passion for cooking was something I could identify with, and her skill and fearlessness made her my heroine.

It seemed more of an afterschool special than a movie but I think that this actually made it more realistic and personally identifiable. No Hollywood fluff, just a simple story of aspirations and dedication. The only thing I wished they had done differently would have been to let her win the regional competition then take second in the national competition. It would have made more sense for the stubborn and set in his traditional ways restaurant owner to have changed his mind. He could then boast to his snobby customers who expect the totally traditional sushi experience that his new sushi chef had won the regional championship, then went all the way to take second place in the national sushi contest. She would be a celebrity and he would safe face. Not that I agree with all that bs but, it would have made more sense since they were pushing this ""anit-woman"" sushi chef idea due to the old Japanese traditions.",1513814400,,983,4.754385964912281

After moving to the US, I saw the same hard working spirit among the Latino community.  To me, this film is a beautiful merging of two cultures that are dear to my heart.  There were so many things I enjoyed about this film - the unique dynamic between each character, the comic relief, the emotional tension created by dreams awakened but not yet realized, the juxtaposition of two very different, and yet altogether similar cultures, and the truly exquisite and aesthetically-appealing displays of Japanese and Mexican food throughout the film.

Right.... yes, the first scenes are about how hard and time consuming it is to support 3 generations under one roof... and yet the solution of the movie is not about scraping by or survival, but about personal meaning and creative expression and, yes, hard work....

Bottom line: if you like sushi and you believe in the resilience and beauty of the human spirit you will likely enjoy this movie.

The entire front staff was Asian (not all Korean, but most). It was the best damn tofu soup I've ever had.

That was years ago. Now I know for a fact that every Korean restaurant in the greater Seattle area has Latino cooks (even chefs)...but only in the back.

This is a great tragedy. The best damn Korean food I've ever had was made by a Mexican chef. It was better than my mom's. And I am not afraid to tell her that :)",1511481600,,770,4.0927152317880795

7588551,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"I loved this film and the ways it explored what ""fusion"" actually means when you're on the frontlines of those cultural clashes and blendings. The film manages to be a satisfying, uplifting and subtly romantic tale without dismissing the difficulty of what the heroine tries to achieve. Does it gloss over the hardship in order to deliver the feel goods? Maybe. Do I care? No. I want some encouragement. This film feels like a really great pep talk right when you need it. Loved it, loved the main character and the actress playing her as well as the actor playing opposite her and the actor playing her father. Their performances carry the film through the less believable parts with conviction and heart.",1510876800,,706,4.795081967213115

It was free of politics, violence, nudity and foul language yet managed to be different, charming and really just a light-hearted escape from my problems tonight, lol. A few subtitles here and there but only about 15-20% of the movie and mostly in the beginning. I think anyone complaining in their review about them probably has difficulty reading. They didn't bother me at all. For someone that doesn't eat sushi, I found the artistic side of what they showcased in the movie quite impressive.",1510704000,,524,4.898876404494382

Its an escape from reality that is entertaining throughout but not quite a 5-star movie. a 10-star rating system would be more appropriate and the 7.1 IMDb score is a little high but not too far off the mark.

I was reminded of Jennifer Lopez's character in Maid in Manhattan because of the single Mom wanting more than the cleaning job she had.  This was beautifully crafted and acted, particularly by the two leads, Diana Elizabeth Torres and Yutaka Takeuchi.  The storyline was credible and fascinating; I think we all love to admire Sushi Chefs and the artistic way food is presented by Sushi Chefs in particular and Japanese Chefs in general.  The underlying attraction between the two leads was also lovely and such a joy to see a movie where this is left at that..... we don't need to see them jumping deep into passion.  I found myself totally compelled by this movie including the competition.  Great entertainment, highly recommended, thank you.",1510358400,,833,4.9855072463768115

Juana's story is such a personal one and so beautifully done, but it is also a universal story of womens' struggle for equality and opportunity in the workplace, women's roles as mothers and daughters, and the challenges that non white people in our communities face every day.  The acting was amazing, especially the main characters Juana, Apa, Lydia & Aki.

I loved the actress who played Juana - and the role is wonderful: strong, independent and talented woman who succeeds through perseverance and talent. Really just a pleasure to watch throughout.

7588584,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"This is a very sweet (but not saccharine) movie with an uplifting theme and subtler messages. It has a refreshing positivity and celebrates a strong work ethic encouraging one to go for their dreams. I loved that it touched on racism and sexism without hammering these themes over our heads. I also really liked that it dealt with challenges and successes between minority groups (here in the US anyways) that didn't involve the typical blacks v. whites. It has a welcome homespun feeling without sacrificing professional production values. The lead actress is very charming and the scenes showing her knife skills are believable. The female lead never relies on her sexuality to succeed but instead puts her head down and works hard to get what she wants. It was very realistic-especially the father's reluctance to encourage his daughter along an unusual path outside of her ethnicity. The actress playing the daughter was very good as well; she was not a pandering, overly-adorable kid. This is a charming, feel-good movie that is not insipid with a unique story. I'm giving it 5 stars as this is a very rare type of movie made these days. It's personal, optimistic, woman/Latino/Japanese-positive, character-driven and does not fall into stereotyping. The perfect movie if you want to be entertained in a gentle fashion. Kudos to this project.",1509753600,2,1347,5.072072072072072

My adult daughter introduced me though I had the occasional hibachi meal while still in NJ and have long enjoyed Chinese food and, occasionally, Thai. Yesterday I did an online search for more information about sushi and learned better manners for eating than I've been using (including the fact that smaller rounds can/should be eaten by hand; one should not mix soy sauce and wasabi; really should not be eaten using knife and fork). Last night, while casting about for something to watch on Kindle and checking out PRIME offerings, I saw EAST SIDE SUSHI, which seemed cosmic under the circumstances.

I think they could have added some more/better music, make the film a bit less dry. Characters were likable, actors competent, especially the dad stood out to me. A few slow boring parts especially 3/4 in towards the end, but good ending. Both Japanese and Mexican cultures were portrayed, pretty simply yet accurately, and this film did some justice to both.

7588624,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"A beautiful movie. As a food movie, this one has a perfect balance between character stars and food stars. As a movie about people from different backgrounds learning to relate to one another, it does a beautiful, real, and honest job. Different people learning to adapt to and educate each other can often end up too scripted, but here you feel as if you are simply watching the actual development of real life. The leads for Juana and Aki are perfect, sweet, and engaging. The supporting cast each adds their own uniqueness to this snapshot of Juana's reality, creating more depth.

There is a contrived underdog-type plot line in the conclusion, which I am afraid does take away some of the believability. However the event is free of overly dramatic Hollywood-esque nail-biters, so the damage to the movie as a whole is minimal.

If you liked this movie you might want to try The Ramen Girl, with Brittany Murphy. It is a slicker, Hollywood wrapped story (meaning it is not as rich has East Side Sushi), but it is memorable nonetheless.",1507939200,2,1040,4.740331491712707

The pacing of the movie is fantastic as every character takes there place wonderfully.  From the kitchen help all the way to
the owner.  The main sushi chef, gives an absolute stellar performance as well as the main character.  This is no ""cheer for the under dog"" movie.
It is a well crafted, wonderfully spoken mix of tradition (good & bad), ethics, grit, personal elevation, multicultural discrimination as well as challenges & victories.  It is simple complexity without being overly complex.  The willingness to bend, when pushed to the edge, happened multiple times but did not seem hokey but kept a genuineness.

7588629,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"As I write this,  tears still coming -  I can only think what of what a beautiful, wonderful, delight this movie is. I have never reviewed a movie on this site.  After watching this film, I feel compelled to do so.  In this day and age of rampant polarization - racial, ethnic, and even gender - this movie should be shown as mandatory for everyone living in our nation.  It is the tale of two divergent cultures, Hispanic and Far Eastern, blending together.  It is the story of a woman's tenacity to fight her way into a male dominated occupation.  And ultimately, it is the story of how far we can all progress when we drop out barriers and become an all inclusive society.  Make no mistake, this is a low budget indie production.  But the acting is terrific, the directing spot on and and the storyline so good and ultimately relevant, I couldn't help but find myself shaking my head in wonder.  Watch this movie,  then get your family, friends, and anyone else you can find to watch it with you - over and over",1507852800,2,1014,4.397849462365591

7588663,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"Brilliant multi-lingual flick that both addresses hard issues in the food industry AND is able to turn into a feelgood piece where you are rooting for the hero to win the day. Juana, played by Diana Torres, is a woman living in a multi-generational household who begins in struggling to make ends meet with dreams stuffed down by the need to survive, who evolves into someone who can possibly see their dreams become a reality - who sees and want to be met with opportunities rather than stereotypes. It is a movie about friendship and perseverance. It is about two cultures with similar foundations of the importance of family and society meeting, fusing, and synergizing into something both traditional and new.

There is one main character who becomes fully fleshed out, and a supporting character who gets mostly filled out yet also follows certain tropes, as well as a double handful of primarily one-dimensional characters who act to drive the movie's plot along its path. Overall, it is well worth watching. Note that English subtitles are embedded for nearly all of the instances when characters are speaking either Spanish or Japanese. The rest of the film is in (American) English. East Side is referring to East L.A., California.

If you're looking for a viewing marathon, I suggest Jiro Dreams of Sushi, followed by The Ramen Girl, followed by this movie, East Side Sushi. Your mind will be overflowing with food knowledge and the heart's kindness.",1488672000,,1460,4.955102040816326

7588696,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"What is it about food that makes a movie so good?

This is a great inspirational movie that reminds one to 1) take a chance 2) get out of your comfort zone 3) try something new 4) practice, practice, practice 5) believe in yourself.

I could go on and on.  I thought the acting was realistically very good. I ended up with a little crush on the head sushi chef, Aki (Yutaka Takeuchi), and in MY story ending, so does Juana, the Latina who wants to come from the kitchen to front and center as a sushi chef. I think I'm not too far from believing that's the direction of the movie ending.

BTW, you also get a peek of the reality of a certain group of people who work hard to support their families, whether it be as fruit vendors, scrubbing toilets, washing cars, or washing dishes. These people, too, have dreams and aspirations for a better life for either themselves or their children.

This is a VERY good movie. Amazon should offer it free to Prime Members and delete some of the bad ones they have (Bachelorette, quickly comes to mind).",1477094400,4,1042,4.3782383419689115

7588707,4,B01A5NZ2MC,"This is one of those types of movies that I wasn't sure I was going to like before I watched.  I decided to watch and give it a chance while I was on a work related trip.  I was really surprised as this was an enjoyable film that explored two completely different cultures and traditions and the interactions between them.  This film starts a bit slowly but has a charm that really drew me into the movie way more than I expected it would.  It is a movie you have to give a chance by watching it all the way through because its ultimate message and story line is well done.  Both Torres (as Juana) and Takeuchi (as Aki) had good chemistry and played their respective roles well.  Although Rodrigo Clarks role was a supporting one, he provided some charming and funny moments as well.  The only part that felt a bit reality TV to me and didn't quite fit with the charm of the movie was the chef competition scene.  Even with that, I liked the movie as its charm and nicely written story won me over.  Even though this was not normally a film that I would watch, it was one that I was glad I took a chance on to watch because I found it worth doing so.

I found the plot to be pleasant (struggling Hispanic family with a temperamental old pickup truck), predictable (fruit truck vendor robbed by thugs), and upbeat (no one ever loses hope). Our heroine steps into a sushi restaurant because of a Help Wanted sign in the window. She starts as a kitchen drudge but by observing and practicing on her skeptical family at home, she improves her skills until she asks to be moved from the kitchen to the sushi bar.

Naturally, Japanese tradition dictates that only men preside in the front of the establishment. Our story continues from there... I liked this one. I didn't love it, but I liked it.",1469145600,4,740,4.648854961832061

She could get a good paying job doing something she does well, but she is bored & wants more.
  I was wondered  if the woman accomplished her goal if then she would turn around 6 months later & decide that she wanted to be a pastry chef,or perhaps a piano tuner or mime ??

If your experience with sushi is limited to California rolls, spicy tuna rolls and Gozilla/Dragon rolls covered in sauce then you won't have any problems with this movie. However, if you really enjoy sushi - legitimate Japanese sushi from real chefs ( I don't care their national origin), then it is hard to stomach watching the champion chefs pouring tons of sauce all over their creation, or tossing their work into the toaster oven.

Sorry, that part annoyed me :)

7588883,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"Hollywood can't make this kind of Gold.

I used to work at a sushi restaurant and the little things in the script is so hilariously true to life... right to the type of customers, the whole having to master cutting cucumber, getting mad at ordering teriyaki chicken at a sushi bar... looking stuff up on craigslist -- the little things! (The only thing I found to be a little unrealistic was how the restaurant getting together during their lunch break(?) feeding their staff nice sushi and rolls... well, I guess they really are a nice restaurant and not stingy to their workers! What luxury...)

The main lead, Juana, is beautiful!! She sort of reminds me of a young Salma Hayek, but cuter. She's great!

The main lead's father deserves Best Supporting Actor award; his delivery and reactions are so natural and hilarious... he's immediately very likable.

Aki, the Japanese chef, (and they actually got a real Japanese guy!) is good too.

Just great casting overall - very very likable cast, even the young daughter. ('There's a Chinese man at the front door.' haha)

I love the scene with the main lead and the chef having sake together; great script-writing. To me, that scene was touching (got me teary) and hilarious at the same time bringing up the issue about being a woman and races. (soo funny and true about assistant chefs being Chinese and Korean... 'he smells like ashtray!' haha Koreans love to smoke)

I love how they intertwine Mexican and Japanese culture together. Very very cool. I really enjoyed it and was engaged the whole time; it went by really fast.

If you work at a sushi restaurant/love sushi/like Mexican/Japanese cultures, or just want a movie to inspire to go after your dreams, watch it. You'll love it.

It's funny, cute, feel-good touching film that you can enjoy multiple times.

It's not a big budget movie and perhaps may have a little high quality TV-Movie feel, but who cares. These are the types of movies that's worth watching; real-life conversations and stories people can relate and be inspired to. The movie was filmed in Oakland, California.

Highly recommend! It has become one of my favorite movies and would watch it again and again. It's no surprise it's winning awards.

One funny goof I noticed... when the chef asks the girl to help him out with the phone orders, she puts it on regular plates instead of a to-go box. xD

Oh and when Mr. Yoshida was cutting the cucumber ""art"" and the customers respond in amazement/kind of sucking up to the chef is sooo funny - that really happens in real life... it's also funny because that cucumber didn't even look amazing at all. What the heck was that mess? Haha",1463443200,5,2658,4.7272727272727275
7588884,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"To start with the cons of this movie, they're aren't really any that stuck out! East Side Sushi is a feel-good, straightforward drama about Juana, a single mom in Oakland who goes from manning a fruit cart to working her way to becoming a sushi chef. The movie is remarkably light on its feet, and much of the focus is on the daily hardships she endures. This film first traveled around a few festivals, and gained positive reviews for its lack of overly dramatic dialogue or over-complicating the narrative. So if you're looking for a movie filled with cursing, violence, and sex, you'll need to look elsewhere. For the rest of us, I highly recommend watching this potentially hunger-inducing film.

That's because sushi is abundant! Even if you're not a sushi fan, East Side Sushi may trigger food cravings, as the film is beautifully shot even with its modest budget. Pricing for a digital copy of this film is comparable online; as of this writing, Google Play, iTunes and Amazon sell an HD copy for $9.99. A DVD copy currently sells for $17 here on Amazon, and there's no Blu-Ray of this film released at the moment.

As mentioned before, the film's plot is simple enough that it allows the characters - especially Juana, played by Diana Elizabeth Torres - to live and breathe within the film's setting. They interact and concern themselves in life routines that make it all the more believable and fun to watch.  When she discovers how great a sushi chef she can be, Juana struggles to thrive as a Latina in a profession dominated by Japanese males. What the movie excels at is its emotional core; we see Juana, even in the face of sexism and racial stigma, get just as much encouragement from her adorable daughter, her father (performed well by playwright Rodrigo Duarte Clark), and Aki, her sushi bar coworker and mentor.

Director Anthony Lucero skillfully juggles the three languages spoken in the film: English, Spanish, and Japanese. The resulting dialogue serves to emphasize the type of cultural clashes you'd expect from a situation like this in reality; it's intriguing, humorous, and surprisingly heartfelt. At one point, just before Juana and Aki go off on their first date, Aki utters something in Japanese that Lucero cleverly omits the subtitles to; if I recall correctly, it's the only time the director does so. Without even understanding the language, it's a great, well-earned moment in the film, and one that speaks to the central theme of how lots of emotions - affection, sympathy, and perseverance - are universal and need no translation.",1463443200,,2568,4.869565217391305

7588893,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Let me say up front that I loved this movie. Why? It was an engaging story about a woman determined to better herself and her family, who rises not with the help of a protest group or organized movement but by working hard and standing up for herself. This is a character that every young woman in the country should see to help them realize they can stand up for themselves and move forward on their own and no one can stop them if they do.

Juana (Diana Elizabeth Torres) is a single mother living with her father and daughter who has dreams of working as a chef. She knows how to cook, she knows what is needed but what she hasn't had is the opportunity to prove herself. Working at a fruit cart she and her father own, she is attacked and robbed one day which sets her off to tell her father that things could be better.

Walking by a sushi restaurant she notices a sign in the window saying they are hiring. Talking to the wife of the owner she gets a position at the restaurant working in the back. But she doesnt just accept her role there. She begins watching how things are done and learns more and more each day. She watches the sushi chefs in front to see how things are done. Noticing her watching, head chef Aki (Yutaka Takeuchi) helps her to understand the various intricacies of how things are done.

He teaches her how to make the rice they use in a specific way and she practices at home. He does the same with how they cut the fish and how other things are handled. Already owning a chefs knife of her own Aki is stunned with how quick she learns. None of that will come in handy when it comes to talking to the owner of the store, Mr. Yoshida.

As old school as they come Mr. Yoshida refuses to allow a woman to work the front line of his restaurant. As far as he is concerned they come her for an authentic sushi experience and there is no place for a woman in that. Knowing she is fully capable this bothers Juana but rather than fight with the owner she continues to work on her skills.

As she researches more and more about the history and skills needed to be a top sushi chef Juana discovers a contest for the most skilled sushi chefs in the city. Not only do the contestants need to have top skills they need to create a dish that is their own. As she experiments with different dishes on her family Juanas skill vastly improve to the point that Aki wants to use her more at the restaurant. When Yoshida objects Juana takes matters into her own hands and enters the contest. With only 4 out of the many who will apply her odds aren't likely. When she is selected to compete you find yourself rooting for her to win. But will she?

This movie was a joy to watch. What makes it so is a combination of the story, the performances and the emotions tied into the path that Juana takes. Each moment on screen isn't a wasted one, with all of the subtle things we see helping to fill out what could have been a short film but instead is a feature that holds your interest from start to finish. You cant help but root for the underdog here and don't let that term bring to you memories of Rocky Balboa. Juana is her own character and is fully fleshed out with a great performance by Torres, enough that Im looking forward to seeing her in other roles.

To use a culinary phrase to describe this film it refreshes the palate with something quite tasty and sparkling that will leave you hungry for more. This is one I can see myself watching more than once.",1462752000,,3528,4.239583333333333

8746509,5,B01A5NZ2MC,"Often, true indie filmmakers don't even have the shoes to claim a shoestring budget, and for any project with a good story to be produced is a miracle. It's a craftsman's heart and artistry poured into accomplishing such a feature; Only to give up his or her baby for the audience to determine its fate and interpretation of the story told in motion pictures with sound. Story is the heart of any movie, and I ask myself if the images, sound, dialogue, characters, and the craft of the actors, all support the story to involve the audience in the Hero's journey, and can only say Encore for this film! This film deserves a watch, and no it may not be accurate on specific things in the film, but I can also say the same about any big budget film. If I really wanted to watch Television on how a Japanese restaurant operates, or how Sushi is made, or the workings of a restaurant's kitchen area, then I'd watch TV. But if I want a meaningful story, then I shall watch the films such as ""East Side Sushi"", and I strongly recommend other watch this film also.",1536364800,,1056,4.392857142857143
8746510,1,B01A5NZ2MC,"This movie does not by any means portray sushi/Japanese kitchens in any accurate way. The writer seems to have never set foot in a Japanese kitchen and romanticizes many of the brutal day to day aspects  of a 'cooking assistant's' (*cough* dishwasher *cough*) life. It is not at all commonplace for dishwashers to prep fish without the chefs consent. 9/10 times, this would be cause for being fired or, at best, yelled at in the walk-in. Furthermore, despite Juana being portrayed as a hardworking, gifted chef, she moved at a sedate pace with inconsistent results. As someone who has been in this character's position- working menial jobs, working in sushi kitchens as someone not of Japanese origin, and as someone who often works over 60 hour weeks- I found this movie painful and insulting.",1536192000,,794,4.925373134328358
