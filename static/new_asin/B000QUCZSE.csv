8398349,5,B000QUCZSE,"I was introduced to this anime a few years after I had seen every single Initial D episode.  I loved Initial D and was completely hooked.  When I discovered this I figured nothing could beat or come close to Initial D.  I was totally wrong.  This is just as good if not better than D.  The races are different, more about speed and tuning than mountain drifting.  But who cares, the story is great and the animation quality is top notch.  Watch the series and see for yourself.",1329436800,14,477,4.3522727272727275
