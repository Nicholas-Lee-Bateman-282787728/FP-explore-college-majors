8569858,4,B00BK6HSFI,"I was only familiar with the first trio which is easy to fall in love with. The others will require several more hearings. The musicians are obviously top notch but apart from the violinist, previously unknown to me. The video content, in my opinion, if anything, detracted from the performance. The audio was good as one expects these days.",1429833600,,341,4.796610169491525
8569859,5,B00BK6HSFI,"MUSIC BEGAN TO FAIL HIM. BRAHMS, ALTHOUGH/HIS DARK FAMILIAR, OFTEN WALKED APART. So wrote Wallace Stevens. I have been listening avidly to classical music for fifty-five years and it has never failed me, nor does Brahms walk apart. I feel as close to Brahms at age 67 as I did when I first heard his four symphonies performed by Bruno Walter in the early 1960s. But it is Brahms's chamber music that I most delight in. especially his revised first piano trio, which is really no longer opus 8, but more like opus 110. So the four works on this dvd are middle and late period Brahms. Everyone is a masterpiece and casts an autumnal glow over the day and hour in which you play it. The three Russian-named musicians who play the three piano trios are consummate musicians; they perform with absolute precision, powerful rhythmic urgency and poetic phrasing. In fact, their performances made me visit my German literature  bookshelf for copies of Heine, Holderlin, Goethe. The poetry enhances the music just as the music provides a threshold through which to enter the enchanted romantic landscape. These three musicians
must be deep devotees of Brahms because they are completely absorbed in their performance and hardly ever look at each other. Their rapport is as remarkable as the music they perform. The cellist and first violinist are clearly in perfect sync when they perform common material. The pianist performs her difficult parts with fierce energy but always tonal beauty. These performances are the ne plus ultra of Brahms chamber music artistry.",1416096000,4,1556,4.961685823754789
8569860,5,B00BK6HSFI,"This is an absolutely superlative performance that does full justice to Brahms's genius & guides us into a transcendent experience that might be termed The Divine Realm of all Classical Music. Every tiny nuance and receding violin tone is captured. Yes, the sound is that exquisitely catered to. The three musicians are ideally framed in camera close ups with unimpeded view of their instruments and full body language. The big dividend for me is correcting my view (taken from CDs) that the piano part almost plays itself because of the clear phrasing and absence of tone clusters. Watching the pianist, I was amazed that the piano part is fiercely demanding and requires immense concentration, as is evident from watching the pianist deliver tempii & incisiveness. ""Watching"" is the key word --- watching is what unlocks so many aspects of these wonderful trios that escape us if we confine ourselves to CDs.

The venue: tasteful, spacious --- several joined rooms of a private home that are revealed to us in the distant camera shots. The close-ups gain from the background painting behind Vengerov that always visually rewards us and the parquet floors not only deliver the subtle individuations of sound, but are given added class by the patent leather shoes of the three musicians who are all dressed for an elegant event. The abundance of natural light completes a perfect amalgam of visual and aural treats.

I never could fathom the DVD interest in big orchestral or choral works, but these intimate performances are VASTLY ENRICHED by seeing what is happening.

With these performances recalling the Rose-Stern-Istomin triumphs of the past, this disc easily bids, in overall terms, to be the most distinguished chamber music release ever issued.",1385424000,9,1755,5.10801393728223
8569861,5,B00BK6HSFI,"This well-recorded and well-filled disc from 1997 takes its place among what is beginning to seem like an outstanding set of performances recorded in the 1990's for Metropolitan Munich. The imaging is very clear in 4:3 format and of good colour rendition and the stereo-only sound can hold its own with the stereo sound associated with CDs of the same vintage. The playing time of 117 minutes is comparable to a 2-disc CD set but supplied on one DVD with imaging added in and therefore this seems potentially very good value.

The key issue with this series of recordings by Metropolitan Munich is that they have been made with artists of international repute in close to studio conditions (i.e. without audience) but recorded as if in a 'live' performance. This gives a sense of vibrant music making that is hard to match artistically within a studio setting while still achieving creditable studio quality sound and vision.

In this case the piano trios are lead by Maxim Vengerov supported by Elena Baschkirova on piano and Boris Pergamenschikow on cello. The curious thing about this set of performances is the absolute lack of visual communication between these three players, Vengerov himself appearing to play throughout by memory and with his eyes shut. Despite this, the partnership between the three players is of a very high order and quite capable of being compared with some of the very best CD performances. This rather suggests a partnership of some duration leading to instinctive empathy based on intensive rehearsal. As comparisons of similar quality, but on CD with sound only, I have those in mind given by the Florestan trio and also Angelich with the two Capucon brothers.

These piano trios performances are marked by subtlety of interaction with much telling musical dialogue throughout. The pianist is especially responsive to the requirements of her colleagues and Brahms. Vengerov takes the leading part in these three works and generally these are passionate readings of the three works, becoming mellower as they progress through the opus numbers. This seems completely logical and leads nicely to the late clarinet trio, written the year before Brahms died. This and the other clarinet works are usually thought of as examples of an autumnal phase in Brahms' creative activities.

Wenzel Fuchs, of the BPO, makes a sympathetic interpreter of this work and is supported by the same pianist plus Dietmar Schwalke on cello. In this case, the cello takes a stronger line than that of the cellist in the piano trios and is therefore more of an equal partner with the solo clarinet. The effect of this is to make the work seem somewhat less autumnal and more virile than it can be and that is no bad thing. It is certainly a satisfyingly valid point of view as an interpretation. This is a view which is fully supported by the excellent pianist who had taken a more gentle role within the piano trios.

This then, is a thought provoking and satisfying set of performances of these major works. It continues the high standards set by previous issues in this mildly historic set of recordings which include fine performances of the complete Beethoven and Mozart piano sonatas by Barenboim and two excellent discs of Schubert chamber music led by Andras Schiff and including the Schubert piano trios. I am expecting to add more discs from this series to my collection.

In the meantime I would suggest that this fine set of Brahms trios is deserving of serious consideration and that concerns over historical compromises to do with technology are unlikely to be a problem. The musical rewards are significant.",1373414400,9,3630,4.962171052631579
