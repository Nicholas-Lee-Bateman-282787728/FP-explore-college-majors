8251084,5,B0013HZJ78,"Colin McRae was by far the most exciting rally driver that ever lived, and his story is worth knowing. The feature includes great interviews with his father (Jimmy, also a rally driver), his wife (Alison), and his first WRC boss (David Richards). I would have liked to see more interviews with the likes of Nicky Grist (long time co-driver), Malcolm Wilson (team boss at Ford), and maybe some rally rivals such as Marcus Gronholm or Carlos Sainz, but that probably would have required a production beyond the scope of this product.

The video really shines in the amount of footage from Colin's career. WRC.com has a decent tribute to Colin in their Hall of Fame collection, and you can find plenty of crash footage or lame music videos on the internet, but if you really like rally, or if you know someone who does, this is what you need to get. You really get a sense of just how challenging rally is, and how skilled Colin was, when they show you a good chunk of onboard footage, without overbearing music and without attention-deficit cutting between shots.

Basically, the definition of rally racing should include McRae's name, or maybe just a link to some footage of his driving. He defined the sport, and any fan of rallying should own this dvd.",1297728000,3,1253,4.6909090909090905
