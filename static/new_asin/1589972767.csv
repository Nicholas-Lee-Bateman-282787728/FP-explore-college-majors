Dave Stotts and Jim Fitzgerald have done an excellant job making history come alive, as well as make sense. I've always appreciated history, but never in my 60 plus years of life, enjoyed learning it, until the Drive Thru History Programs. I stumbled across his program, when he first started on TV. His narrative made learning history fun for me, as well as connected history together, which may be the biggest difference. History text books did much to dry up my interest in History, where the DTH series woke up my desire for learning & understanding history. Great Job Dave & your fantastic team! Thanks for also providing a school program that will stimulate children (and adults) to understand our world's past. We have ALL the DTH DVDs and have purchased many as gifts.
Drive Thru History DVD's have always been appreciated gifts...All Programs/Episodes/Series are winners!!",1265414400,2,999,4.9880239520958085
