7844129,4,6303347711,"This is an unofficial remake of the French movie ""Un Carnet du Bal"" made by the same director some 3 years earlier .
It revolves around an aged but still beautiful woman ,Lydia(Merle Oberon)looking back across the gulf of some 50 years on her romances with 4 different men .
There is Michael (Joseph Cotten)a doctor and the son of her wealthy familiy's butler -john Halleday ;then there is Bob (the future TV Superman ,George Reeves)a football hero and Frank (Hans Yaray)a blind pianist/composer. Most important of all there is Richard(Herbert Marshall)a man who opted for a seagoing life and the only one of the 4 she really loved passionately . She has stayed true to their love but a sad and melancholy bitter sweet truth concerning their relationship  awaits in the key revelation near the end of the movie .
The movie is episodic and some will find it sentimental .I prefer to see it as an extravagantly romantic movie ,lavish in every way. It is sumptuously mounted ,beautifully photographed and boasts an Oscar nominated score by the great Miklos Rosza at his most sweepingly romantic. The turn of the century gowns worn by the ladies  are gorgeous also
Oberon was for me not a strong enough presence as Lydia and I kept wishing that stars like Crawford,Davis or Bergman has been available .She looks ravishing however and the rest of the cast give exemplary performances .Watch out for a nice cameo from Edna May Oliver ,too
This is a wallow in romance ;leisurely in pace and elegant in design it remains a sad ,touching ,serene meditation on the power of love and loss. Studio movie making at -or near-its best",1195171200,18,1619,4.73758865248227
