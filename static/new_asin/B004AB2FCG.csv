By and large, I agree with Susan Benson's review;  what I would add to it is this:  to a considerable extent, there is no connection between the music and what is happening on the stage.",1517184000,,355,4.693548387096774
8419892,3,B004AB2FCG,"Like most of you who love to watch ballet, you're probably hooked on the Royal Ballet version done by Frederick Ashton, which is totally classical ballet.  In that version, the story is clear and easy to follow.

I'm not a big fan of the more modern dance choreography and had trouble following the story line and figuring out who was who because of the costuming.  The first act has everyone costumed in baggy outfits, which didn't make any sense to me.  I think the character of Diana plays a bigger role in this version than the Ashton version where she just appears in the third act.

The second act moves us to gala party scene with beautiful costumes (the cover is from the second act), but again, the movement between sets and the ""sameness"" of the costumes made it difficult for me to follow the story line.

In any case, you can't go wrong with the Delibes score that we all love.  Some of the dancing is quite beautiful.  Personally, I didn't ""get"" the interpretation.",1396569600,4,978,4.548571428571429
