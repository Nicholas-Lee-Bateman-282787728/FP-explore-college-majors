8604843,5,B00EEXESCK,"I have all their live DVDs and this has become my favorite.  It has a lot to do with the two medley songs, they are tremendous.

The Great Escape/Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You
Kissing You/Way To Go

The girls were in top form for this one.  The version of Stay Girls is perfection.

Buy this!",1433548800,,292,4.052631578947368

8604847,5,B00EEXESCK,"I was kind of skeptical for this Japan Tour because I wasn't feeling the majority of the outfits, and performances (judging off of fancams) but after getting this DVD I was shocked. Back then nothing could have beat their 1st Japan/2nd Asia Tour. I truly love their 1st Japan Tour and the love I have for their 2nd Japan Tour is right up there. The VCR videos were great, some of my favorite performances was Animal, Paparazzi, Reflection, Boomerang, Beep Beep, Time Machine and Stay Girls.

If you're a SONE or a Girls' Generation fan, then this concert DVD is a must have",1395360000,,573,4.563106796116505
