8420470,5,B004AM5Q26,Chocked full of wisdom that you can only get from good old fashioned at home conversation with conjurers and Spirit workers of the old world. People may complain about the quality of the visual and sound but the information you get is soooo worth it.,1449360000,2,250,4.5777777777777775

8420472,1,B004AM5Q26,"I always like watching presentation such as this one. They're very entertaining..........not for the information they contain, but because so many idiots actually believe in this rubbish and nonsense. I love the seriousness that the people involved in such shows try to come across with. To me its remarkable that they can keep a straight face while looking into the camera. That is; I personally would find it hard not to smirk while rattling off the drivel that these shows contain.
Now, for anyone with even 500 working brain cells and the ability to pay attention to what they're witnessing and being told, I would ask one question. ""If you BELIEVE in this garbage, where's the results?"" Do you get what I mean? WHAT HAS THE RUBBISH PRODUCED FOR THE PRESENTERS AND THE PRACTITIONERS SO FAR? WHERE'S THE BEEF? Because I'll tell you; whether its witchcraft or conjure or ceremonial magick or whatever, all I see is a bunch of adults fooling around with THEATRE. They're PLAYING GAMES - WITH THEMSELVES. But after the dust settles, its the same old world and they have their same old lives, and they aren't any further ahead in any direction than they were before they started. Candle burning, chanting, full moon rituals, etc., and then what? Then NOTHING. Which proves that none of this ludicrous buffoonery is good for anything except for people like Foxwood to make a buck on while selling it to a lot of True Believing nincompoops who are so simple minded, so childish, so fantasy-driven and deluded, that they'll put their faith and trust in anything and everything........including little bags filled with objects and substances that are supposed to bring ""Good Luck"". Well folks, if it was all that simple the entire world would be in a vastly different conditon than it is today.
Now, if you want a taste of what REAL ""magic"" is; just look into a book like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Age-of-Manipulation-The-Con-in-Confidence-The-Sin-in-Sincere/dp/0819186538/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Age of Manipulation: The Con in Confidence, The Sin in Sincere</a>&nbsp;and you'll get your eyes opened wide to what really makes the world tick and people dance on command. But forget this drivel. Its for primative, stupid, backward, low-grade morons.......the bottom of the societal barrel. It hasn't produced anything for such people in the past and it won't now. IT IS SUCKER BAIT and nothing more.",1370908800,,2454,5.278772378516624
8420473,4,B004AM5Q26,"I must admit as a traditional practioner of Hoodoo and Powwow for over 35 years, I approached this DVD with a sense of cynical scepticism.  It seems that every spiritual opportunist and former wiccan priestess/occultist/anything-to-make-a-buck author has recently jumped on the traditional and folk magic bandwagon claiming to have had some traditional training from some usually unnamed, unverifiable source.  For the most part, their efforts at this fakery are shallow, reprehensible and downright laughable.  As I listened to Mr. Foxwood however, I realized that he does seem to have had some real experience, exposure and has developed an authentic awareness of this particular magical/spiritual tradition.  In addition, unless he is a really good actor, he appears genuine and does not seem to be fabricating his experience.  His dialogue and description of crossroads magic seemed particularly accurate and made me really begin to listen.  I think overall,his workshop/lecture on this DVD is well worth your monetary and personal-time investment. It provides a good introduction to and ambience of the Applachain Hoodoo tradition.  If this peaks your interest, you might also check out his book and any by Bryon Ballard of Asheville. There is so much to learn and to have the authentic folk magic experience, you must teach yourself and practice with deep personal commitment.  My conratulations to Mr. Foxwood for a job well done.",1364774400,8,1437,5.383928571428571

8420475,5,B004AM5Q26,"This is the first DVD I have seen on Southern Conjure and it is worth every penny. I loved Orion Foxwood's personality and energy.

If you are interested in learning a bit about old Southern magick, this is the DVD for you.

I hope that he makes more DVDs to follow with this one.

You will enjoy it.",1330732800,8,300,4.137931034482759

Blessed Be!
