8122265,1,B000FGGN78,"I received a low-quality bootleg copy with terrible sound.  The sound quality was far worse than that of two different used VHS copies of the same movie.  Apparently this was never released on DVD, and that's why there's a market for this.",1498521600,,239,4.666666666666667
8122266,4,B000FGGN78,I would try to find this product cheaper.  Over-priced for what you get.  A lot of narration that is monotone.  Good info about Judo history though.,1217808000,,148,4.615384615384615
8122267,5,B000FGGN78,A great series of Judo history by Hal Sharp. A must for Judo players.,1167782400,,69,4.0
8122268,5,B000FGGN78,"Hal Sharp is an American Judo treasure. He wrote the first book I ever bought back in 1965 and it still holds up today! Now Hal has taken hundred of hours worth of 16mm films he made in the 50's while stationed in Japan and put them on DVDs. These are rare and include judo legends like Mifune, Kotani, Okano, Kimura, Diago, and many more.  Hal narrates the action with his personal memories of what it was like to be there.  Thank You Hal for doing this.",1148860800,,455,4.218390804597701
