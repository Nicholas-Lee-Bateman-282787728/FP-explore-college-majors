This looks like something copied off TV in VHS and then transfered to DVD.  Now I know that is not the case but just pointing out the over all quality of the set.  Colors shift on some episodes and the picture quality is soft.  I buy hundreds of DVD each year and many of the TV series.  But this is truly the poorest quality I have seen so far.  I know, Paramount will come back and say that this is because it is an old show, etc etc etc.  But that is bull.  Why Paramount couldn't have remastered the set before transfer is beyond me.  They could have cleaned this set and offered the kind of quality I get from Universal, Disney, etc. Final statement - A great TV series that deserves better quality.  Shame on you Paramount as you continue to blunder ahead.",1215820800,38,901,4.335329341317365

3153195,5,B001675ZJM,"The 120 hour-long episodes of the detective drama ""Cannon"" were originally broadcast on CBS from 1971-1976.  There was also a two-hour pilot, which premiered on March 26, 1971 and a two-hour sequel broadcast on November 1, 1980.  This DVD set includes on the first twelve regular episodes of the first season (no pilot).  The episode titles, original broadcast dates, and notable guest stars are detailed below.

""Cannon"" was probably the least pompous of the original entries in television's anti-establishment police/private-eye subgenre; setting the stage for ""Harry-O"" and ""The Rockford Files"".  Rotund actor William Conrad played the title character; dubbed ""Cannonball"" in Mad Magazine's satire of the series.  After years as the voiceover narrator of ""The Fugitive"" and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", Conrad finally was allowed to be on-screen and is said to have incorporated a lot of his own quirky characteristics into the Frank Cannon character.

Frank is a detective who only takes a case when he feels like it or his pressed for cash to maintain his expensive epicurean lifestyle (i.e. adventures in eating).  Most of the action in the series is in the form of car chases; there is some fighting but almost no running.  Lacking a handsome co-star ""Cannon's"" producers were obviously ceding most potential female viewers to the other networks during this time slot; which is generally a good thing for those in the target demographic as there are no compromises to expand the audience.

""Cannon"" was a quality Quinn Martin production with logical situations, good suspense, and fast pacing.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

3153196,4,B001675ZJM,"""Cannon"" was one of the staple ""gimmick"" detective shows of the 1970's.
Cannon was overweight (and he used this fact on numerous occasions to escape from the bad guys), Columbo was dishevelled and drove a clunker car, Barnaby Jones was old and would order milk in a bar, Kojak was bald and sucked lollipops and McCloud was a cowboy in New York. Cannon was a Quinn Martin production and, in general, QM shows were not of the caliber of shows by those such as Bruce Geller, and Levenson & Link (Mannix, Mission: Impossible and Columbo) but Cannon was the exception.  The show had top writers and its first season Associate Producer was Paul Playdon who, as a writer, wrote some  of the finest episodes of Combat, Mission: Impossible and others, so a  lot  of hard work and talent went into this series as well.  On top of it all, there was William Conrad's fine acting, making Cannon a character one can identify with.

My only complaint is that they are breaking up the first season into two separate packages whereas all the other shows of that era (which usually had something like 24 episodes per season unlike the early 1960's when it was over 30) have included entire seasons in one package.",1207180800,9,1195,4.613207547169812
3153197,5,B001675ZJM,"I have waited for this for years to finally come to dvd. I have the series on old vhs tapes recorded from TV Land back in 1996.
I hope they release all seasons because i will buy them all!
Cannon is a great series from the early 70s! Thanks CBS for finally releasing this.",1207094400,5,272,4.055555555555555
3153198,5,B001675ZJM,"William Conrad had been around for quite some time before he became best known for being private eye Frank Cannon in the Quinn Martin television series, ""Cannon."" He had been an actor, producer, and director for movies and television shows, and was best known for three programs that used his voice only - being the voice of Matt Dillon on the radio version of ""Gunsmoke,"" the narrator of the classic cartoon series ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" and the narrator of another Quinn Martin series, ""The Fugitive.""

When Martin looked for someone to play an overweight, but very capable private eye in Cannon, he could have picked a better actor than Conrad. Even though he was best known for his vocal talents, Conrad made Cannon a flesh and blood character - charming, humorous, compassionate, and on occasion, violent. For once, Conrad had a chance to show as much talent on camera as he had off camera. And with Martin's penchant for creating solid detective dramas, Cannon became a very popular series.

Conrad would have other notable gigs after Cannon, the emcee of CBS' Thanksgiving Day festivities, the DA in ""Jake and the Fatman,"" and for too brief a time, ""Nero Wolfe,"" but he will always be remembered at the portly detective who drove a Mark IV, had a car phone (very rare at the time), and who knew as much about cooking as he did the law.",1206662400,13,1361,4.714285714285714
3153199,5,B001675ZJM,"Finally, ""Cannon,"" the Classic TV private eye series that premiered in 1971 is making its debut on DVD, with a four-disc boxed set collecting the first half of the show's Season 1 episodes.

Its star, William Conrad made a very big presence as Private Investigator Frank Cannon, well beyond the veteran actor's trademark girth. His deep, resonant baritone voice, and his remarkable acting demanded viewer's attention throughout the series' five-year run - and it still does today.

Cannon was a tough L.A. sleuth with very refined tastes. But, what could have been a forgettable series became an instant Classic when the versatile Conrad portrayed the character with depth and feeling. Cannon cared about his clients and it showed, so viewers cared about him.

Since Cannon's size didn't allow for many fist-fights and gun battles, which were the staple of the TV landscape of the day (and sadly still is), the series substituted car chases and high quality and innovative production values in their place.

Cannon had once been a police officer, but was discharged from the force for being overweight. After the murder of his wife and son, Cannon tracked down the killer and confronted him in a tearful and angry scene that still resonates. That loss and a deep understanding for the need for real justice, prompts Cannon to launch his successful career as a private investigator.

Cannon charged high fees to his well-to-do clients so that he could work for poorer clients at little or no charge. He also indulges his high-priced lifestyle, which includes a penthouse on the Sunset Strip, gourmet culinary delights and cooking, expensive wine, and regular maintenance on his Lincoln Mark IV, which was frequently damaged as a result of his cases.

""Cannon"" was a staple of producer Quinn Martin's popular detective shows. It was nominated for a Best Drama Emmy in 1973, and Conrad was nominated for Best Dramatic Actor in 1973 and 1974. In 1980, Conrad reprised his role in a TV-movie, portraying Cannon coming out of retirement to investigate a friend's reported suicide.

The CBS series featured many of Quinn Martin's well-known stylistic innovations. ""Cannon"" marked the first time a QM series aired on a network other than ABC. Also for the first time, producers made a bold decision in 1973 to try to spread the established viewership popularity of ""Cannon"" to another QM show. They had Conrad's character ""cross over"" and appear routinely on the fledgling investigative series, ""Barnaby Jones,"" which starred Buddy ""Beverly Hillbillies"" Ebsen, which was a QM series that began in 1973 and ran concurrently with ""Cannon"" on CBS.

For his part, Conrad was a star long before ""Cannon."" He created the role of Marshal Matt Dillon on the original radio version of  the Classic western ""Gunsmoke"" in the 1950's. After ""Cannon,"" Conrad starred in ""Jake and the Fatman,"" and was ""Nero Wolfe,"" as well as narrating numeroust TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and Manimal.

But, ""Cannon"" is considered by many to be the greatest achievement of Conrad's distinguished career, having created a character at once genial, witty, erudite, cultured and astute - but tough-as-nails.

Guest stars in ""Cannon's"" first season include: Tom Skerritt, Wayne Rogers, Mark Hamill, Joan Van Ark, Tim O'Connor, Vic Tayback, Kim Hunter, Dack Rambo and the late-great Roy Scheider.

Season 1 of ""Cannon"" had 24 episodes, including the two-part pilot. This four-disc DVD boxed set represents the first-half of the those episodes. Expected episodes are: Pilots Part I & II; Salinas Jackpot; Death Chain; Call Unicorn; Country Blues; Scream of Silence; Fool's Gold; and The Girl in the Electric Coffin; Dead Pigeon; A Lonely Place to Die; No Pockets in a Shroud; Stone Cold Dead; and Death is a Double Cross.

Season 1 Vol. 2, yet to be announced for preorder, is expected to collect the remainder of the first season episodes: The Nowhere Man; Flight Plan; Devi''s Playground; Treasure of San Ignacio; Blood On the Vine; To Kill a Guinea Pig; The Island Caper; A Deadly Quiet Town; A Flight of Hawks; The Torch; Cain's Mark; and Murder By Moonlight.

(Special Note: After the cancellation of Cannon, Conrad starred in ""Jake and the Fatman."" Conrad was Jason L. ""Fatman"" McCabe, DA, and Joe Penny, who portrayed Jake Styles, and Alan Campbell who played Derek Mitchell, two Private Investigator who teamed up with McCabe to get the bad guys first in L.A., then later in Hawaii. The series ran from 1987 to 1992.

CBS DVD and Paramount Home Entertainment have scheduled ""Cannon - Season 1, Vol. 1,"" and ""Jake and the Fatman - Season 1, Vol. 1,"" for DVD release on the same day.)

Series begins to hit its stride at the end of Volume 1 of season 1.  This collection is good, but you can tell that they were working on Frank Cannon persona, tough guy or more of a kindly uncle.  This was an enjoyable collection.  Some have complained of picture quality, but it's certainly acceptable.  The one issue is that Cannon filmed at night and in color in a lot of episodes that makes things look dark.  In the early 1970s a lot of shows filmed almost exclusively in the day such as Mannix or McMillan and Wife.  Some of the episodes are a little dark, but it was not a big deal to me.  I think season 1, v2 or season 2 probably has the show after they perfected the character, but this part one season one 4 disk set is still enjoyable.",1429056000,,913,4.311764705882353

3153233,5,B001675ZJM,"Cannon, which ran for 5 seasons from 1971 to 1976, was a terrific detective mystery series led by the incredibly fit big actor William Conrad.  They didn't have altering computers or trick cameras back then, and besides him being a wonderful dramatic actor (see The Killers with Burt Lancaster), he appears to actually be doing most of his athletic stuntwork and definitely all the chasing of the criminals.  He had a gruffly endearing manner as Detective Frank Cannon, and the stories were intelligently written and peppered with recognizable TV and film stars of the 70s, some of which are listed below next to their featured episode on this Season 1 Volume 1 4-disc DVD set:

His characters have always been powerful and his delivery intelligent and natural. He had the most convincing ability to express terror or grief with restrained stoicism of any actor I have ever seen. With those qualities  in mind, I naturally enjoyed watching William Conrad in the Cannon series. I think the Cannon character was the real William Conrad. The technical quality of the DVD is like that which existed existed on broadcast television when the shows were made. This was before the comb filters that extracted a little more resolution from color television came out in the eighties. Other than that, the tape to DVD transfers have been made with utmost care and there are no noticable visual or audio changes or losses from the original recordings.  Also, notice that Quinn Martin used the techniques of Film Noir. I'm looking forward to the complete Cannon series appearing on DVDs.

I would love to see FBI come out one of these days. These shows are actually better than I remebered! William Conrad, looking like a fatter version of Truman Capote with a bushy moustache, is never convincing in his short, always out of breath fight scenes (in one shot, they actually speed up the film to make it look like he's running), but he's got that awesome voice and personality to spare.

3153255,4,B001675ZJM,"Cannon was a solid TV detective series that ran for 5 years on CBS. With most TV shows, the first year is  a work in progress; defining the characters, getting creative scripts that take advantage of the character's personalities and nuances, etc. Seinfeld's first half dozen episodes were terrible; Kramer wasn't defined yet and no Newman. Homer Simpson was not defined well until Season 3 of The Simpsons. Both were great shows with very slow starts. Cannon was no different. The pilot and first part of Season 1 start out a little less than stellar, but by the middle of Season 1 we see Conrad's Cannon starting to become better defined into the character that carried the show for 5 seasons. I hope Paramount follows through with the entire series because the series gets better over time; although, in my opinion, it probably hit its peak in the 1973-1974 season (Season 3). The video is not what you might call 21st century DVD quality, but I had no issue with it at all when watching the episodes. I actually prefer watching the episodes like I originally saw them or as they appeared in early syndication. This was an early 70's show, so I like the fact that it seems like I am watching an early 70's show when I re-watch the episodes on the DVD. No real bonus features to this DVD, but I am fine with that too. After all, almost everyone associated with this series left us many years ago, so what can really be provided. I don't need Vince Van Patton providing commentary about how great it was to work with an actor like Conrad when he was just a child....  I am only giving Season 1 - 4 stars - but I anticipate that if Season 2 and 3 make it to the market I will be upping my rating to the maximum 5 stars.",1219536000,2,1719,4.385579937304075
3153256,4,B001675ZJM,"One of my favorite TV shows. After the pilot and first two episodes, Cannon finds his stride and away we go (In the first two, he got beat up way too much and looked as if his entire fighting ability was to absorb punishment. This was quickly corrected by episode three). Conrad was excellent in the part. That there are no real special features beyond the episode promos and the fact that it is released in two parts is disappointing. Maybe they didn't want to put too much into it thinking that no one would buy it? Too bad.",1218585600,2,526,4.3232323232323235
3153257,2,B001675ZJM,"Well, I, too, had rather good memories of watching ""Cannon.""  I can only say now, having watched the first disk's worth of Season 1, that I must have missed the first season or two; for, these first several shows (the two-hour pilot and first two episodes) were simply terrible.  Although a long-time admirer of William Conrad, his portrayal of Cannon was so inept as to be laughable.  In the second episode, for example, he loses his gun twice, he enters a locked apartment using a key, but fails to lock the door behind him so that he is then caught unaware when someone else walks through the now-unlocked door (fortunately for him, a cop), and he just generally stumbles about throughout the ""drama.""  He appears a little more competent in the pilot (which benefits from a cast that includes Vera Miles), but in the initial regular-length episode which follows he is altogether clumsy (loses his gun again, allows himself to be outwitted several times by rodeo clowns).  In sum, though he claims to be an experienced detective (ten years as a cop, etc.), his actions belie the claim.  Really, really disappointing shows all.
My wife summed up the first disk succinctly by asking, ""How many seasons did this thing run again?""  I doubt we'll bother to load the second disk.  Two stars, then, simply out of nostalgia for the Cannon I thought I remembered.",1217030400,8,1356,4.764957264957265
3153258,5,B001675ZJM,I've been waiting on this release for years. It's unfortunate that CBS did not see fit to release the entire season but I am happy nonetheless. I can't wait to get volume 2.,1216857600,3,173,4.2727272727272725
3153259,3,B001675ZJM,"Cannon was, without a doubt, one of my top 5 detective series of all time. My problem with this set is the fact that it has been released without being re-mastered, and because it comes in two volumes. Why would Paramount do such a thing? As a company, when you try to rip off your customers, you lose much of your credibility. Universal released the Columbo series without re-mastering, and without extras (except for an episode of Mrs. Columbo - oh, joy). Paramount has also done the same thing with Mission: Impossible - no extras, and ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"". Can these companies not take a page from Criterion and release their shows in the very best quality they possibly can with all the bonus material they can? I will pay extra for Criterion released movies because they have demonstrated that they are willing to go the extra mile for their customers. Hey Paramount, how about re-thinking this series, and get it right starting with volume 2?",1216512000,14,995,4.757225433526012
3387688,3,B001675ZJM,"I just can't give more then 3 stars.  Not because this is a great series..but because Paramount continues to offer sloppy looking copies.  This looks like something copied off TV in VHS and then transfered to DVD.  Now I know that is not the case but just pointing out the over all quality of the set.  Colors shift on some episodes and the picture quality is soft.  I buy hundreds of DVD each year and many of the TV series.  But this is truly the poorest quality I have seen so far.  I know, Paramount will come back and say that this is because it is an old show, etc etc etc.  But that is bull.  Why Paramount couldn't have remastered the set before transfer is beyond me.  They could have cleaned this set and offered the kind of quality I get from Universal, Disney, etc. Final statement - A great TV series that deserves better quality.  Shame on you Paramount as you continue to blunder ahead.",1215820800,38,901,4.335329341317365

3387692,5,B001675ZJM,"The 120 hour-long episodes of the detective drama ""Cannon"" were originally broadcast on CBS from 1971-1976.  There was also a two-hour pilot, which premiered on March 26, 1971 and a two-hour sequel broadcast on November 1, 1980.  This DVD set includes on the first twelve regular episodes of the first season (no pilot).  The episode titles, original broadcast dates, and notable guest stars are detailed below.

""Cannon"" was probably the least pompous of the original entries in television's anti-establishment police/private-eye subgenre; setting the stage for ""Harry-O"" and ""The Rockford Files"".  Rotund actor William Conrad played the title character; dubbed ""Cannonball"" in Mad Magazine's satire of the series.  After years as the voiceover narrator of ""The Fugitive"" and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", Conrad finally was allowed to be on-screen and is said to have incorporated a lot of his own quirky characteristics into the Frank Cannon character.

Frank is a detective who only takes a case when he feels like it or his pressed for cash to maintain his expensive epicurean lifestyle (i.e. adventures in eating).  Most of the action in the series is in the form of car chases; there is some fighting but almost no running.  Lacking a handsome co-star ""Cannon's"" producers were obviously ceding most potential female viewers to the other networks during this time slot; which is generally a good thing for those in the target demographic as there are no compromises to expand the audience.

""Cannon"" was a quality Quinn Martin production with logical situations, good suspense, and fast pacing.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

3387693,4,B001675ZJM,"""Cannon"" was one of the staple ""gimmick"" detective shows of the 1970's.
Cannon was overweight (and he used this fact on numerous occasions to escape from the bad guys), Columbo was dishevelled and drove a clunker car, Barnaby Jones was old and would order milk in a bar, Kojak was bald and sucked lollipops and McCloud was a cowboy in New York. Cannon was a Quinn Martin production and, in general, QM shows were not of the caliber of shows by those such as Bruce Geller, and Levenson & Link (Mannix, Mission: Impossible and Columbo) but Cannon was the exception.  The show had top writers and its first season Associate Producer was Paul Playdon who, as a writer, wrote some  of the finest episodes of Combat, Mission: Impossible and others, so a  lot  of hard work and talent went into this series as well.  On top of it all, there was William Conrad's fine acting, making Cannon a character one can identify with.

My only complaint is that they are breaking up the first season into two separate packages whereas all the other shows of that era (which usually had something like 24 episodes per season unlike the early 1960's when it was over 30) have included entire seasons in one package.",1207180800,9,1195,4.613207547169812
3387694,5,B001675ZJM,"I have waited for this for years to finally come to dvd. I have the series on old vhs tapes recorded from TV Land back in 1996.
I hope they release all seasons because i will buy them all!
Cannon is a great series from the early 70s! Thanks CBS for finally releasing this.",1207094400,5,272,4.055555555555555
3387695,5,B001675ZJM,"William Conrad had been around for quite some time before he became best known for being private eye Frank Cannon in the Quinn Martin television series, ""Cannon."" He had been an actor, producer, and director for movies and television shows, and was best known for three programs that used his voice only - being the voice of Matt Dillon on the radio version of ""Gunsmoke,"" the narrator of the classic cartoon series ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" and the narrator of another Quinn Martin series, ""The Fugitive.""

When Martin looked for someone to play an overweight, but very capable private eye in Cannon, he could have picked a better actor than Conrad. Even though he was best known for his vocal talents, Conrad made Cannon a flesh and blood character - charming, humorous, compassionate, and on occasion, violent. For once, Conrad had a chance to show as much talent on camera as he had off camera. And with Martin's penchant for creating solid detective dramas, Cannon became a very popular series.

Conrad would have other notable gigs after Cannon, the emcee of CBS' Thanksgiving Day festivities, the DA in ""Jake and the Fatman,"" and for too brief a time, ""Nero Wolfe,"" but he will always be remembered at the portly detective who drove a Mark IV, had a car phone (very rare at the time), and who knew as much about cooking as he did the law.",1206662400,13,1361,4.714285714285714
3387696,5,B001675ZJM,"Finally, ""Cannon,"" the Classic TV private eye series that premiered in 1971 is making its debut on DVD, with a four-disc boxed set collecting the first half of the show's Season 1 episodes.

Its star, William Conrad made a very big presence as Private Investigator Frank Cannon, well beyond the veteran actor's trademark girth. His deep, resonant baritone voice, and his remarkable acting demanded viewer's attention throughout the series' five-year run - and it still does today.

Cannon was a tough L.A. sleuth with very refined tastes. But, what could have been a forgettable series became an instant Classic when the versatile Conrad portrayed the character with depth and feeling. Cannon cared about his clients and it showed, so viewers cared about him.

Since Cannon's size didn't allow for many fist-fights and gun battles, which were the staple of the TV landscape of the day (and sadly still is), the series substituted car chases and high quality and innovative production values in their place.

Cannon had once been a police officer, but was discharged from the force for being overweight. After the murder of his wife and son, Cannon tracked down the killer and confronted him in a tearful and angry scene that still resonates. That loss and a deep understanding for the need for real justice, prompts Cannon to launch his successful career as a private investigator.

Cannon charged high fees to his well-to-do clients so that he could work for poorer clients at little or no charge. He also indulges his high-priced lifestyle, which includes a penthouse on the Sunset Strip, gourmet culinary delights and cooking, expensive wine, and regular maintenance on his Lincoln Mark IV, which was frequently damaged as a result of his cases.

""Cannon"" was a staple of producer Quinn Martin's popular detective shows. It was nominated for a Best Drama Emmy in 1973, and Conrad was nominated for Best Dramatic Actor in 1973 and 1974. In 1980, Conrad reprised his role in a TV-movie, portraying Cannon coming out of retirement to investigate a friend's reported suicide.

The CBS series featured many of Quinn Martin's well-known stylistic innovations. ""Cannon"" marked the first time a QM series aired on a network other than ABC. Also for the first time, producers made a bold decision in 1973 to try to spread the established viewership popularity of ""Cannon"" to another QM show. They had Conrad's character ""cross over"" and appear routinely on the fledgling investigative series, ""Barnaby Jones,"" which starred Buddy ""Beverly Hillbillies"" Ebsen, which was a QM series that began in 1973 and ran concurrently with ""Cannon"" on CBS.

For his part, Conrad was a star long before ""Cannon."" He created the role of Marshal Matt Dillon on the original radio version of  the Classic western ""Gunsmoke"" in the 1950's. After ""Cannon,"" Conrad starred in ""Jake and the Fatman,"" and was ""Nero Wolfe,"" as well as narrating numeroust TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and Manimal.

But, ""Cannon"" is considered by many to be the greatest achievement of Conrad's distinguished career, having created a character at once genial, witty, erudite, cultured and astute - but tough-as-nails.

Guest stars in ""Cannon's"" first season include: Tom Skerritt, Wayne Rogers, Mark Hamill, Joan Van Ark, Tim O'Connor, Vic Tayback, Kim Hunter, Dack Rambo and the late-great Roy Scheider.

Season 1 of ""Cannon"" had 24 episodes, including the two-part pilot. This four-disc DVD boxed set represents the first-half of the those episodes. Expected episodes are: Pilots Part I & II; Salinas Jackpot; Death Chain; Call Unicorn; Country Blues; Scream of Silence; Fool's Gold; and The Girl in the Electric Coffin; Dead Pigeon; A Lonely Place to Die; No Pockets in a Shroud; Stone Cold Dead; and Death is a Double Cross.

Season 1 Vol. 2, yet to be announced for preorder, is expected to collect the remainder of the first season episodes: The Nowhere Man; Flight Plan; Devi''s Playground; Treasure of San Ignacio; Blood On the Vine; To Kill a Guinea Pig; The Island Caper; A Deadly Quiet Town; A Flight of Hawks; The Torch; Cain's Mark; and Murder By Moonlight.

(Special Note: After the cancellation of Cannon, Conrad starred in ""Jake and the Fatman."" Conrad was Jason L. ""Fatman"" McCabe, DA, and Joe Penny, who portrayed Jake Styles, and Alan Campbell who played Derek Mitchell, two Private Investigator who teamed up with McCabe to get the bad guys first in L.A., then later in Hawaii. The series ran from 1987 to 1992.

CBS DVD and Paramount Home Entertainment have scheduled ""Cannon - Season 1, Vol. 1,"" and ""Jake and the Fatman - Season 1, Vol. 1,"" for DVD release on the same day.)

Series begins to hit its stride at the end of Volume 1 of season 1.  This collection is good, but you can tell that they were working on Frank Cannon persona, tough guy or more of a kindly uncle.  This was an enjoyable collection.  Some have complained of picture quality, but it's certainly acceptable.  The one issue is that Cannon filmed at night and in color in a lot of episodes that makes things look dark.  In the early 1970s a lot of shows filmed almost exclusively in the day such as Mannix or McMillan and Wife.  Some of the episodes are a little dark, but it was not a big deal to me.

They didn't have altering computers or trick cameras back then, and besides him being a wonderful dramatic actor (see The Killers with Burt Lancaster), he appears to actually be doing most of his athletic stuntwork and definitely all the chasing of the criminals.

His characters have always been powerful and his delivery intelligent and natural. He had the most convincing ability to express terror or grief with restrained stoicism of any actor I have ever seen. With those qualities  in mind, I naturally enjoyed watching William Conrad in the Cannon series. I think the Cannon character was the real William Conrad. The technical quality of the DVD is like that which existed existed on broadcast television when the shows were made. This was before the comb filters that extracted a little more resolution from color television came out in the eighties. Other than that, the tape to DVD transfers have been made with utmost care and there are no noticable visual or audio changes or losses from the original recordings.  Also, notice that Quinn Martin used the techniques of Film Noir. I'm looking forward to the complete Cannon series appearing on DVDs.

I would love to see FBI come out one of these days. These shows are actually better than I remebered! William Conrad, looking like a fatter version of Truman Capote with a bushy moustache, is never convincing in his short, always out of breath fight scenes (in one shot, they actually speed up the film to make it look like he's running), but he's got that awesome voice and personality to spare.

3387752,4,B001675ZJM,"Cannon was a solid TV detective series that ran for 5 years on CBS. With most TV shows, the first year is  a work in progress; defining the characters, getting creative scripts that take advantage of the character's personalities and nuances, etc. Seinfeld's first half dozen episodes were terrible; Kramer wasn't defined yet and no Newman. Homer Simpson was not defined well until Season 3 of The Simpsons. Both were great shows with very slow starts. Cannon was no different. The pilot and first part of Season 1 start out a little less than stellar, but by the middle of Season 1 we see Conrad's Cannon starting to become better defined into the character that carried the show for 5 seasons. I hope Paramount follows through with the entire series because the series gets better over time; although, in my opinion, it probably hit its peak in the 1973-1974 season (Season 3). The video is not what you might call 21st century DVD quality, but I had no issue with it at all when watching the episodes. I actually prefer watching the episodes like I originally saw them or as they appeared in early syndication. This was an early 70's show, so I like the fact that it seems like I am watching an early 70's show when I re-watch the episodes on the DVD. No real bonus features to this DVD, but I am fine with that too. After all, almost everyone associated with this series left us many years ago, so what can really be provided. I don't need Vince Van Patton providing commentary about how great it was to work with an actor like Conrad when he was just a child....  I am only giving Season 1 - 4 stars - but I anticipate that if Season 2 and 3 make it to the market I will be upping my rating to the maximum 5 stars.",1219536000,2,1719,4.385579937304075

That there are no real special features beyond the episode promos and the fact that it is released in two parts is disappointing. Maybe they didn't want to put too much into it thinking that no one would buy it? Too bad.",1218585600,2,526,4.3232323232323235
3387754,2,B001675ZJM,"Well, I, too, had rather good memories of watching ""Cannon.""  I can only say now, having watched the first disk's worth of Season 1, that I must have missed the first season or two; for, these first several shows (the two-hour pilot and first two episodes) were simply terrible.  Although a long-time admirer of William Conrad, his portrayal of Cannon was so inept as to be laughable.  In the second episode, for example, he loses his gun twice, he enters a locked apartment using a key, but fails to lock the door behind him so that he is then caught unaware when someone else walks through the now-unlocked door (fortunately for him, a cop), and he just generally stumbles about throughout the ""drama.""  He appears a little more competent in the pilot (which benefits from a cast that includes Vera Miles), but in the initial regular-length episode which follows he is altogether clumsy (loses his gun again, allows himself to be outwitted several times by rodeo clowns).  In sum, though he claims to be an experienced detective (ten years as a cop, etc.), his actions belie the claim.  Really, really disappointing shows all.
My wife summed up the first disk succinctly by asking, ""How many seasons did this thing run again?""  I doubt we'll bother to load the second disk.  Two stars, then, simply out of nostalgia for the Cannon I thought I remembered.",1217030400,8,1356,4.764957264957265
3387755,5,B001675ZJM,I've been waiting on this release for years. It's unfortunate that CBS did not see fit to release the entire season but I am happy nonetheless. I can't wait to get volume 2.,1216857600,3,173,4.2727272727272725
3387756,3,B001675ZJM,"Cannon was, without a doubt, one of my top 5 detective series of all time. My problem with this set is the fact that it has been released without being re-mastered, and because it comes in two volumes. Why would Paramount do such a thing? As a company, when you try to rip off your customers, you lose much of your credibility. Universal released the Columbo series without re-mastering, and without extras (except for an episode of Mrs. Columbo - oh, joy). Paramount has also done the same thing with Mission: Impossible - no extras, and ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"". Can these companies not take a page from Criterion and release their shows in the very best quality they possibly can with all the bonus material they can? I will pay extra for Criterion released movies because they have demonstrated that they are willing to go the extra mile for their customers. Hey Paramount, how about re-thinking this series, and get it right starting with volume 2?",1216512000,14,995,4.757225433526012
