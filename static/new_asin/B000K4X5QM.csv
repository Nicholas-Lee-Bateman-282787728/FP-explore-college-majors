2682545,5,B000K4X5QM,"Just like the last reviewer, I too did not pay attention to the label on the back where the aspect ratio is listed as Anamorphic Widescreen. However, I actually like this improvement.

Not only is this season Widescreen (which the previous six seasons were released in Full Scrren), I like the mastering of the picture much better as well. I have an HDTV with an HD Up-Convert DVD changer. Compared to the last six seasons, the picture quality of Season Seven is much better, clearer, and shaper. There was always some form of fuzziness with the previous seasons that may or may not have been visible on non-HD electronics. But rest assured, you get excellent quality with Season Seven. Great improvements. The packaging is excellent too with vibrant colors.",1169510400,8,758,4.875968992248062

2682564,5,B000K4X5QM,The 7th season is a particularly good season.  I think my favorite character is Arthur.  His quirkiness and sometimes egotistical personality really make the show.,1392940800,,163,5.48

2682569,5,B000K4X5QM,"I can't think of a collection of finer comedy talents than that of Kevin James, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt and Leah Remini.  The writing is tailored so fabulously well to their individual talents which results in a wonderfully hilarious show.",1374537600,,244,5.1

2682574,5,B000K4X5QM,"I loved this show, still do. Jerry Stiller is absolutely perfect as the ""crazy old man."" He makes the show. I can laugh because I don't have to live with him. They have dead pan humor and it's still one of my favorites. There are a ton of episodes, which is great.",1356566400,2,264,4.096153846153846
2682575,3,B000K4X5QM,"I have all seasons of King of Queens and have watched them many times.

Kevin James' comedy skews way too young and silly for me when left to his own devices but in this series, with the writing and the other fun characters, it works.

It seemed noticeable with Season 7 that the writing had changed and the other characters,aside from Leah were not used as much. Just last night watching episodes 1 to 7 of Season 7, it seemed like a different show. I know that Seasons 7 to 9 had their moments and treasured episodes but the best were the first 6 Seasons.  And why was Season 9 cut short? Likely there was plenty going on in the background with the production. I've noticed with other comedy shows, they over-reach after 6 years.

That said, I will always keep the King of Queens dvd sets handy for a laugh.",1351814400,3,809,4.337748344370861
2682576,5,B000K4X5QM,"This series never seems to get old with me. I've probably seen every episode several times, but it still makes me laugh! Each character is hilarious for varied reasons, & you can't help but just feel good after watching them take on life's very familiar ""problems"". THIS is America at it's best!",1349049600,,295,4.6923076923076925
2682577,5,B000K4X5QM,"Love this show, especially Arthur how he always seems to have the last word lol You've also gotta love Doug's taglines.",1344816000,,119,4.714285714285714
2682578,2,B000K4X5QM,"This Season I think started the downhill fall for the Comedy Series King of Queens. This season had some of the dumbest and most boring episodes ever. Doug and Carrie argue WAYYYYY to much now and its hurtful arguing and not funny, stuppid arguing. Deacon rarely shows up and I miss that!  :(. So what I basically trying to say is that this Season is not very good. Thats just my opinion",1343520000,4,387,4.375
2682579,5,B000K4X5QM,"Just as i have said before on the series , you just can't go wrong with the king of queens:) it is funny , and you really feel for the guy at times. Yep poor ol doug...just can't get ahead:)",1343088000,,190,3.775
2682580,5,B000K4X5QM,"And I thought Season 6 was great!  One of my favorite episodes in this set here is when Doug has to work in the Chinese restaurant that he's renting an apartment above (Apartment Complex). This guy is so funny. Kevin James is ten times funnier than Ray Romano, and TKOQ is ten times funnier than ""Everybody Loves Raymond.""  Whereas, Raymond is a cowering p-whipped coward in most anything he does; at least Doug has a personality and actually stands up to Carrie (most of the time).  And Doug has real class when he takes care of a baby, to prove to Carrie that he can be a great father. Very touching moments in the episode ""Fresh Brood"".

Yes, these are the episodes where Carrie is chubby from pregnancy, but Leah Remini has been and still is beautiful. Carrie complements Doug so much with her rough and tough talk. She and Kirstie Alley are particularly hilarious in their segment of the aforementioned episode ""Apartment Complex.""  And Carrie's episode involving the iPod she doesn't pay for feaking funny (Ice Cubed).

What a great season to a superior comedy series. Just thinking of Doug's misadventures, cracks me up!",1311724800,,1127,4.753846153846154

2682587,4,B000K4X5QM,I had seen the episode where Doug fakes a heart attack because he couldn't remember someone's name. It made me laugh because my husband can never remember anyone's name either.  I bought this DVD for my husband for his birthday and we enjoyed an evening of laughter. Doug cracks us up!,1222041600,,285,4.588235294117647
2682588,5,B000K4X5QM,LOL funny.  I just can't get enough of it.  I onl;y wish they were still doing these shows together.  Laughing from episode one to the end.  When I'm done with them all I can start from the beginning and it's like something new to me.,1219881600,,234,4.133333333333334
2682589,3,B000K4X5QM,"When this series started, it was a fun look at a quirky family whose members were sometimes crazy but always lovable.  By Season 7, Doug had turned into a selfish little boy and Carrie was just as selfish, but also cruel.  In this season, it doesn't seem like they care for each other anymore, and the viewer is left to wonder why they even live in the same house.  As a family unit, they were no longer believable.  In real life, Kevin James had lost weight and Leah Remini was still recovering from pregnancy.  But on the show, Carrie relentlessly criticizes Doug for being fat.  The writers needed to recognize reality, move on, or quit.  We did enjoy the development of supporting characters, but as far as Doug and Carrie's marriage is concerned, it just isn't working anymore.",1211846400,11,782,4.6231884057971016
2682590,5,B000K4X5QM,How could anyone not like this show...it is so funny.  My husband and myself both have favorites of this funny TV show.  We lay in bed and laughed until we cry.  What a wonderful way to end a day!,1192752000,4,196,3.9743589743589745

2682592,5,B000K4X5QM,"I love this show. This season Carrie is having a hard time shedding those extra pounds and it does effect the show to a degree. We just don't want to see this little firecracker all bloated! This season was still great and the Widecreen works for me in my home theater,so I'm happy with that addition. The DVD set should be in every fans collection.",1181174400,,349,4.384615384615385
2682593,5,B000K4X5QM,"I love this show, I don't understand why the don't sell this show on DVD in Australia like other shows aswell reba, and whole lot more. thank god for AMAZON.COM.

Doug (Kevin James) cracks me up. While Carrie (Leah Rimini) is always mad about him and they always fight. It's a classic Sitcom. I think it's funniest Sitcom ever. I think personally Season Seven was my favourite. includes episodes when Carrie takes a ipod without paying for it, Doug trys his hardest go to las vegas and lies to carrie and alot more episodes.

If your're thinking of buying it, don't think anymore this show is garunteed to crack you up!",1180569600,,619,4.5675675675675675
2682594,5,B000K4X5QM,"I am a huge fan of the show.  ""King of Queens"" is one of the last remaining sitcoms.  I know that it is airing its last 7 episodes starting this month and that is sad.  IF you are a fan of the show I recommend this DVD along with the other seasons.  This is a show that can be watched multiple times and still gets big laughs.",1176163200,4,326,3.8208955223880596
2682595,4,B000K4X5QM,"For many years now I have thought and still think that The King of Queens is the best sitcom out there.

The show has manage to hold a high quality throughout the years, altough

the later seasons have lacked a little bit of creativity. I still enjoy it very much but feels that the earlier seasons had a better ""replay watching""

I still wish that they could add the option to have subtitles, but this is just a minor problem.

But in overall the seventh season still delivers laughter and joy to much satisfaction. Recommended.",1175817600,3,529,4.536842105263158

The picture quality of each disc is excellent, too.",1174521600,2,345,4.672131147540983

We are huge KofQ fans, but were very dissapointed with season 7.  Did they get new writers or something?  It's like it just stopped being funny from one year to the next.  We highly recommend every other season, but don't waste your money on this one.",1174089600,6,391,4.22972972972973
2682599,5,B000K4X5QM,"Every single one of the King of Queens episodes are worth watching!  This show is by far one of the best TV sitcoms.  Season 7 as well as every season prior to it are hilarious, especially when Arthur (Jerry Stiller) is in it.  Doug and Carrie really have great chemistry also.  My favorite 7th season episode is when Arthur tries to get his one year supply of Rice a Roni that he was supposed to have received 20 or so years ago when he was a contestant on a game show.",1173916800,4,470,4.131868131868132
2682600,5,B000K4X5QM,"""The King Of Queens"" is a great show, I think we all know that. The 6th Season was probably the pinnacle for the show, but the momentum carried over into the 7th Season. For me, this is what I refer to as the beginning of 'The Fat Years' for the character of Carrie Heffernan. The weight gain is never really discussed, so it's kind of like the elephant in the room, no pun intended. Leah Remini (Carrie) got pregnant in real life and she gained a lot of weight during her pregnancy and she showed it a lot. I don't understand why they didn't right her pregnancy into the show, it would have made perfect sense for Doug and Carrie to have a baby together. Just imagine the jealousy and subsequent storylines that would happen with Arthur. Anyway, I just find it distracting because it's never really mentioned that I can remember (I'm just now re-watching the episodes on DVD).

Nevertheless, it's a great show and this season is really good. You can't really go wrong with ""The King Of Queens"".",1173744000,15,995,4.497237569060774

2682602,5,B000K4X5QM,"King Of Queens season 7 has got to be the funniest of them all, from Doug going back reliving his high school days as a Teen counselor"" guiding all the new team feeling young again without realizing they think he is exactly what he is, washed up. Even back to Carrie in her new career with Arthur , well, just plain being Arthur. It was seriously the best season I had come across. Great buy for anyone who thinks Fred and Wilma Flintstone, Peter and Lois Griffin, and Homer and Marge Simpson are perfect couples (Fatty and Hottie). Try it out, you'll love it.",1173312000,2,560,4.394230769230769

Doug finally conquers his fears of being a bartender and makes an alcoholic feel bad for ordering a non alcoholic drink on his first order, it's hilarious.  So many great episodes so little time but once you start watching this show you will never stop becasue it hooks you very quickly.
