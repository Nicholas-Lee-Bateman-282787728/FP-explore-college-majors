8514310,2,B007C8CFIS,"I was disappointed.  I loved the CSE set that I had purchased and had high hopes for the college course set.  For the most part, it was redundant and outlined the original seminars. The quality of the cds was satisfactory.  If one had not watched the CSE set (or heard the podcasts), these might be of greater value for one who wished to share the information.  However, I got more from the original set and had watched them repeatedly, soaking in as much information as I could.  It could be that my expectations for this set were too high.",1454630400,,541,4.424242424242424

But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:  1 Peter 3:15",1441152000,,387,4.260273972602739
