2453859,1,B000C7RAGI,"Save your money!!  There is NOTHING to learn in this DVD.  What is so hard about surviving the wilderness when you bring your own food and sleeping bag?  They obviously weren't in a survival situation when they brought all they needed to survive.  They spent their time making huge baskets that they didn't use, and wasted firewood making clay pots.  They tried to tan a hide but it was obvious that they didn't know how.  The female in the video was wearing buckskins with very long fringe with striped tube socks and long johns.  The long fringe was a waste of usable leather and will no doubt tangle in the woods.  They expended energy cutting down live trees when God provides plenty of dead wood on the ground to build a shelter.  The video was mostly filled with the maker of the video rambling about something.  I think he did the talking to put more time on the video.  It was home video quality and they tried to be funny in a lot of the scenes but weren't.  Save your money!  You could learn a whole lot more seeing Survivorman or a similar program.  That is real surviving.  Not this DVD.  I am going to try to sell mine now.",1182124800,19,1136,4.338095238095238
2453860,1,B000C7RAGI,"You could hear the rain on the metal roof as they waited for it to stop before they went ""naked into the wilderness"".",1172707200,12,117,4.130434782608695
2453861,1,B000C7RAGI,"if you'd find learning primitive skills from Treebeard in the wilderness of the ""big fields behind the shopping mall"" your idea of a good time, you might enjoy this movie. I'm sure Kansas is pretty wild in some places, but there could be better places to film such things. Furthermore, the pace of this video will leave most people under 70 looking at the clock every few minutes.

In all seriousness... I am sure that some of the skills in this video would be very useful, especially if you're looking to leave the first world culture and take up residence in a remote village of Papua New Guinea, Venezuela, or apparently some of the more remote parts of Kansas. The people in the video appear to be very knowledgeable, it's just that there should be rules that govern the sale of some items - dictating that that some things become public domain when they're either really old, really poor video quality, or when they induce a certain level of drowsiness when watching.

This video, despite having knowledgeable and useful information by some seemingly very nice people meets all those criteria. If it were free, I might have continued watching it. As it is, I couldn't bear it after about 45 minutes.",1369785600,2,1204,4.701421800947867
2453862,3,B000C7RAGI,"but LITTLE given of actual procedures , processes and ""stuff"" used . definitley interesting and worth the price .watching tools and food and such worked together from wild ""stuff"" and places . again , worth the price , but i had hoped and the taglines had promised more .",1361491200,,271,4.551020408163265
2453863,4,B000C7RAGI,"I bought this video for my boys, who love learning primitive skills.  They did learn a lot from this DVD.  It is entertaining in the fact that the participants, especially the creator of the film, are real Mountain Men (and a woman) who aren't afraid to act the part.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the quality of film isn't spectacular, and the music is a little off-putting.  But the boys love it, and would probably be able to use some of the tips in here if they wanted.",1357516800,,477,4.266666666666667
2453864,3,B000C7RAGI,This is an informative video but its not entertaining.  The narrator has awesome skills in the wilderness but does not have entertaining people skills LoL.,1353801600,,155,5.2
2453865,4,B000C7RAGI,"This video shows how a group of people can survive in primitive conditions by using wilderness skills along with their hand made tools, clay pots, clothes, shelters, and much more.  It doesn't show as much ""how-to"" techniques as I would like to see.
The skills of the two guides are exceptional.  The success rate on making functional clay pots was unbelievable.",1348444800,3,362,4.918032786885246
2453866,3,B000C7RAGI,When I am critical I like to give examples of how to improve something.  However I can't think how to improve it.  It was informative but it was very drawn out and boring.  The grass roots and firing the pottery was new to me as well as making the stone tools.,1346889600,,260,4.0588235294117645
2453867,5,B000C7RAGI,"Although this is somewhat ""dated"", it is really worth the watch.  Get it along with his book (which I highly recommend) and you'll really get an appreciation for what it ""takes to survive"".  John and Geri are masters at what they do.  Everything I have read about their style is legit.  The quality of the video is ""not Hollywood grade"", but I like it.  No high running drama in this video.  Just a video about downright plain hard work and skills that have been perfected over years and years of practice.",1335830400,,506,4.5054945054945055
2453868,4,B000C7RAGI,"This is a great video that really helps illustrate the usefulness of primitive skills and the relative ease of living you can have with such knowledge.  I own and appreciate the book by the same author, Primitive Wilderness Living & Survival Skills, and was really hoping to see the video version of this book here.  This is not that.  It's more of a Trailer for the book instead of a companion guide.

While there is some brief How To information in here, it's mostly just showing off tools and skills to prove how life can exist without modernization.  You can see weaving of cordage being performed, flint knapping, deadfall traps and all sorts of other great skills but the video never really showed how to do 90% of it.

I highly recommend Renting this video as opposed to buying it, since there's not a whole lot worth coming back to time and again.  It was a great fire starter for my mindset in this field, and also highlighted the importance of a few modern items.  For instance I think in my emergency kit I'll definitely keep leather gloves, plenty of cutting utensils, and pots and containers.  These seem to be the most critical items that are created in this video using primitive skills, and life could be much easier with just a few of these simple items, even with nothing else.  With this sort of knowledge you don't really need much else.",1331596800,6,1357,4.570247933884297
2453869,5,B000C7RAGI,An outstanding DVD demonstrating the majority of survival skills necessary for long term survival living. The skills are demonstrated by some of the United States finest primitive skills technicians. Be warned though...this is not a step by step instructional video. The makers of this DVD have a seperate video series that are step by step. This DVD is a demonstration of all that is necessary in long term survival.,1193184000,5,417,5.057971014492754
2453870,1,B000C7RAGI,I'm so mad i didn't think to read the review on this dvd because it was dead on. This was one of the worst dvd's I've ever bought. They just dink around with arts and crafts and they don't even show you how to do any of the things they do. I learned nothing from this dvd and i strongly encourage you to never think about this dvd ever again.,1188950400,8,342,3.9

Packaging was great.  Thanks!",1419984000,,93,5.066666666666666
8096210,1,B000C7RAGI,"I cant figure out if this is a joke or if these people are on dope. this film is almost two hours of cutting grass, making clay pots and stone axes. not practical training of any kind.",1414022400,,184,4.0
8096211,3,B000C7RAGI,"I Guess there is only so much you can put in a video, but it would have been nice to see something a little more instructional rather then this is what we did. Not knock'n it, but not high five'n it either.",1409875200,,206,3.9285714285714284
8096212,1,B000C7RAGI,Cheaply shot home videos ! A boy scout could do this stuff! Would not recommend if you have any survival knowledge at all or any common sense!,1400371200,,142,4.296296296296297
8096213,3,B000C7RAGI,"It's an okay show, but the video quality is poor and it just doesn't progress as quickly as I would prefer it to.",1396569600,,113,3.9565217391304346
8096214,5,B000C7RAGI,"I have been learning about prepping. This video was shot on by a person not exactly professional but not horrible. The thing I enjoyed most about it was the techniques and tips that they were showing. It really helped in knowing how to set up a camp, start a fire, hunt for food and water. I was surprised about the calmness and community of the group, they had their own specific jobs that they wanted to do and went about completing their tasks. There was no fighting complaining arguing or division in the group.  Maybe I'm used to seeing reality shows and expecting the controversy. For a couple of bucks I would recommend this movie.",1396310400,,638,4.547826086956522
8096215,3,B000C7RAGI,"Though not a really good read, this is however a book to keep handy for emergencies.  I have a copy near my night stand that if ever needed will go into my backpack for survival needs.  It is a good book to own and have on hand, but not something you would necessarily sit down and read. But keep it handy nonetheless.",1380844800,,318,4.112903225806452
8096216,2,B000C7RAGI,"I thought it would have some ""how to's"" NOT! Very disappointed. It was like a home movie of their camping trip. I have no doubt they know their stuff, but they didn't show it in this video.",1369872000,,189,4.135135135135135
