There are 5 types of ""Nature"" video's,

1) Travel,  2) Documentary,  3) New-Age music/nature,  4) nature slide show 5) ambiance.

1) There is a place for this, kind of nice if your trying to decide if you want to visit some place, find out what's there
2) Documentary, hopefully something by the BBC like Planet Earth.
3) A video scene but who ever filmed it pretty much finds nature boring, they feel it has to be livened up with some music to be tolerable.  I find these usually annoying.
4) The guy who films this likes nature but in short bursts, kind of like living life with nothing but ""video bytes"" nothing lasts more than a minute, often only 5-10 seconds.  Kind of like vacationing on a Bus tour.  Again I have trouble enjoying this, you get to see a lot of different things or views but you don't feel like you've been any one place, more like you ran through a museum just glancing at each thing never slowing down.

This Finnish Archipelago Blu-Ray one is what I consider ambiance type 5.  It's for when you wish you could walk to the beach sit down and look out at the water just enjoying the sight.  Basically they took a HD cam and set it up on a pristine location letting it run without any human intervention as a stationary camera.  This is just was I was hoping for, I took a chance buying it based on the description.

I pop it in pick one of the scenes, sit comfortably in a chair and read, listening to the wind and waves and little birds.  Every so often I look up for 5-15 minutes and enjoy the view.  Makes me feel like I've gone on a vacation, but to someplace without a cell phone, no tourist traps, museum, or nick-nack stores.  This is just a remote area where I can sit down and enjoy the view.  The only thing missing is the wind, the sun on your face and smells.  Some day someone will invent a hollo-deck, but until then this is the best your going to get.

I could see this being very nice for a bed ridden individual who can't get outside to enjoy the real thing.

If anyone knows of a similar video let me know.

8478403,3,B005LPWLLK,"The issue here is what do you want from this disc, it has no program and is just 6 30 minute virtually still photographs with ambient sound. Most are photographed against the sun and consequently the bulk of what you see is dark, the beauty is in the sky. The ferry scene has some action but all the rest are just waterside scenes. Most could be either sea or lake, something Finland has in abundance, and as a frequent visitor to this gentle and serene land I can vouch for the authenticity. The complete lack of any action or story makes it unsuitable as a travelogue but if you just want a window on nature in a dark corner of your home then this will do nicely. The sounds are again just ambient noise with a variey of what bird watchers call LBJs (little brown jobs - nameless small birds) and only the occasional honk of something bigger. Nothing appears on screen to perfom other than a pair of out-of-focus dragonflies in photo 2. I would have preferred some rather more spectacular views, most of what is on offer is quiet and modest. I still have not decided how I might use it, it is not something one can watch in the conventional way as absolutely nothing happens. Play it when doing your yoga or meditation perhaps.",1355270400,,1229,4.418502202643172
