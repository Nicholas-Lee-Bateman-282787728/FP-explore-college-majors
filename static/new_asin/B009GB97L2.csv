5324915,3,B009GB97L2,"This concert is a good introduction to Gregg Allman. It runs at a good clip with only a 52 minute running time, and there are no lengthy jams as the Allman Brothers Band was prone to do. Ten songs in a small setting with a decent crowd, and you get just enough to satisfy. This is a full screen presentation that seems as if it were taken from a TV broadcast, so the picture is decent, but nothing special. You get a choice of stereo or ""Simulated"" 5.1 surround sound. For a 1988 concert, I can't imagine the 5.1 blowing me away that much, so the stereo was a fine option for me. Also, being from 1988, this concert was recorded at the height of the band's career as the charting single ""I'm No Angel"" is included in the setlist. (Hence, the concerts title.) There is a good all around live mix for the band, and all the instruments are heard well through the stereo speakers. This is a basic blues and boogie outing by the band, with the exception of the title track and ""Slip Away"", so be prepared. Here's a little background on the band and the band members at the time of this show.

5324917,5,B009GB97L2,"I bought this because I saw Dan toler at his benefit show in macon, ga, and was sad to hear of his passing recently.
He shows his fantastic guitar playing in this earlier concert.",1363392000,8,179,4.294117647058823
5324918,5,B009GB97L2,"I've been an Allman Brothers & Gregg Allman fan since 1969. Duane & Gregg, the whole Band! After Duane's death, Gregg had the time to reflect, and to try some Solo Music. I loved it then, and still Love it today. This performance is a Great Example of what Greggory Allman Does Best! Be it 1988 or 2013...",1360195200,8,305,4.275862068965517
5324919,5,B009GB97L2,I loved this album. Gregg Allman/Allman Brothers band are some of the great artists. They influenced modern rock and so many artists today. I would suggest that anyone purchase this album for their collection.,1359158400,6,209,5.176470588235294
5324920,5,B009GB97L2,"This will be a classic, lots of close up face shots of Gregg and the rest of the band. Gregg's vocals are right on target, Dan Toler's guitar playing is as tasty as it gets. Great song selection, I have nine DVD's of the Allman Brothers and this is one of the best. Sound quality is great I would say 9/10 picture is 8/9, for the time period I can't complain at all. This is a true must have and the only DVD I have seen of Gregg's solo band's, I can't imagine an Allman fan not excited about this release. Only down fall is it is 52 min., I hope they have more of this type of footage available in the near future. I can't get enough of this one.",1357344000,28,647,3.946564885496183

5324927,5,B009GB97L2,I saw this tour and watching this DVD brought back great memories. I am a big fan of Gregg Allman as well as the Allman Brothers. His take on ABB songs while away from the group are like listening to different songs. I love that approach.,1380758400,4,238,4.195652173913044
5324928,1,B009GB97L2,I was very disappointed in the sound quality. Nothing in the preview indicated that this was in single channel sound. After listening to it once I threw it in the trash.,1374537600,,169,4.483870967741935
5324929,4,B009GB97L2,"This is a good example of what Gregg Allman was doing in the eighties, after the Allman Brothers Band broke up. I saw the Gregg Allman band a few times during that time period, and this is a good representation of that sound. Features the late Dan Toler on guitar. The sound and video are both very good.",1372464000,4,304,4.258620689655173
5324930,5,B009GB97L2,I really like this CD and listen to several of the tracks over and over.  A very compelling piece of work.,1372204800,2,106,4.0476190476190474
8541158,5,B009GB97L2,"Great live show without the 2 guitar/drum format of the Allman Bros. Dan Toler coaxes some exquisite tone from his Les Paul & had the ability to actually build a solo from  laid back cool to  high energy crescendo. Anyone giving this one star have obviously never actually played in a professional band, and apparently possess a tin ear as well. We have lost both Greg (one of the greatest white blues singing voices of all time) and Dangerous Dan and this is a testament to their great muscianship. And by the way, the rest of the band cooks the whole set as well !!",1523750400,,567,4.390476190476191

8541164,5,B009GB97L2,"Got this for Christmas.  The main thing I would like to point out is that this DVD is really more of a Dan Toler DVD than a Gregg Allman one.  Dan, playing Dickie Betts old guitar which Dickie used on the Fillmore and other recordings, is probably featured more than Gregg.  I don't know who was in charge of the cameras and video production, but Eric Clapton needs to hire them.  The camera actually focuses on who is soloing at the time.  Eric's Crossroads DVDs are awful in not showing the soloist and showing people's backs, the crowd or other irrelevant things.  If you're a fan of Gregg or Dan or just like the sound of Dickie's old guitar, get this DVD.",1422144000,,660,4.368852459016393

8541167,3,B009GB97L2,"Sound quality similar to an old VHS, good show with spot on musicianship as expected. I still like this era of Greg A. More tender and mellow with 80's keyboard sounds in all their glory. The two Allman Brothers albums of the early 80's sort of hinted at this direction Greg would take. Pretty cool stuff, guess I prefer the CD's to this concert.",1418083200,2,346,4.421875
