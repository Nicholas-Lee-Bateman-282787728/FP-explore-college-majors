8414972,4,B0043HQWA8,"We loved this early movie based on the lovely story from the depression years of the United States of ""Mrs. Wiggs of The Cabbage Patch"".  Mrs. Wiggs could find something good in everything that happened to her as she took in washing and ironing to make ends meet.",1383868800,,263,4.479166666666667
8414973,5,B0043HQWA8,Fields and Zasu Pitts make a classic team in Mrs. Wiggs. Joe E.  Brown is confident but hopelessly hilariously incompetent.,1373846400,3,123,5.15
8414974,3,B0043HQWA8,"Greetings All, I was so looking forward to this movie, but it had it's problems. When it first started picture was jumping around a bit, later it was ok. The picture itself was not a good copy and the sound was very poor. I hope the seller will try to upgrade this to keep people happy! Cheers! William",1371254400,2,302,4.224137931034483
8414975,1,B0043HQWA8,"I have just received this DVD and tried to watch it.  I lasted about 5 minutes. After this I just scanned through it. This is the worst quality of a commercial DVD I have ever seen. I have bought bootleg discs that were much better.
  I originally bought a Beta machine in the 80s.  When Beta died, I copied anything I could not find on VHS over to the new format.  Later I bought a home DVD burner, and put these movies on to DVD.  The quality here is about the same as the ones I had to re-copy twice. You can see noise bars and lines caused by dirty heads on old video tape machines, and the sound is so full of hiss that it sounds like it was from an old 78 rpm record.  My copy of ""Earthworm Trackters"" from TCM looks much better.
  What a disappointment.  I am also disappointed by amazon for selling such a poor quality effort.  It also appears to be burned on a DVD-R.  I plan to complain.  Don't waste your money.",1345507200,4,922,4.083798882681564
8414976,4,B0043HQWA8,"Long unavailable on dvd (or vhs) and rarely aired on tv or in festivals, the issuance of ""Mrs. Wiggs..."" is cause for rejoicing by W. C. Fields fans!

The first hour or so is a 19th century melodrama that may have you weeping even today. An archetypical narrative of a saintly, seemingly fatherless large family, befriended by a wealthy patron in town, but about to lose the cabbage patch to a wicked landlord.

Just when you feel like hitting the ""stop"" button, W. C. Fields enters as...well, as a variation on many of his 30's film roles...regal yet poor; polite yet pompous; hilarious yet somewhat self-centered; capable of hood-winking as he may be hood-winked; a hidden heart of gold; out for himself; an exaggerator and teller of tall tales. His capable foil here is Zasu Pitts-- worried about becoming an old maid--and there are hilarious bits afoot as a match is attempted between her and Fields. The last several reels are almost priceless Fieldsiana. Will Mrs. Wiggs and her lovable brood endure? Stick around for the finale. Besides, no Fields fan or lover of old movies should be without this old chestnut.

I could not get more than 10 minutes into the Joe E. Brown vehicle but, as a wonderful fellow Fields fan pointed out to me on the club site, any movie starring the guy from the classic last scene of Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"" can't be all bad.",1313884800,7,1370,4.652892561983471
8414977,5,B0043HQWA8,"Mrs Wiggs of The Cabbage Patch is an odd yet charming film. The first part deals with Mrs. Wiggs struggling in the face of hard times. H is broke, her husband is missing, her son is very sick, and yet she puts a brave face on it. This comes to a tear jerking climax with a very touching hospital scene. The second part is funny as W. C. Fields makes his entrance as the suitor that neighbor Zasu Pitts sent for. A tried and true comedy routine in which Zasu, who can't cook, is supplied with yummy food by Mrs. Wiggs to impress her possible future husband. Don't worry, there's a happy ending.
Earthworm Tractors is even funnier, as Joe E. Brown plays a won't-take-no-for-an-answer salesman bent on selling tractors to a crotchety old coot. Ah, but the coot has a pretty daughter! The best scenes take place when Joe E. Brown tries to demonstrate the tractor, with calamitous results. Also on the DVD are a couple of WC Fields shorts, The Golf Specialist and The Fatal Glass of Beer, both pretty funny.",1285027200,10,1002,4.48087431693989
