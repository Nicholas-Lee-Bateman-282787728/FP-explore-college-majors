8181121,4,B000NQRTVO,"This film costars my favorite martial art actor Chen Kuan Ti in this film he plays the role of a villian, Ti Lung plays a martial arts master who is addicted to opuim and along the way it begins to effect his fighting skills. Theres a scene in the film where Chen fights Ti using double short spears that is a classic, the reason I don't give this film 5 stars is because there are not a lot of fighting in this movie. But I will say that the scenes where Ti Lung tries to free himself from his addiction are very powerful.",1207180800,,523,4.087378640776699
