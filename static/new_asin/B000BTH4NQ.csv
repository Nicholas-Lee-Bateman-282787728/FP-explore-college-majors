2440995,4,B000BTH4NQ,"This DVD offers an awesome collection of aurora images. The opening scenes are particularly breathtaking. Unfortunately the very beatiful places where the images were shot were not included in the credits. Also I  think the authors could have included some explanation as to why some scenes appeared to have been shot during daytime and not at night. Having witnessed and photographed the Aurora from Fairbanks ,Alaska and used long exposure times, I know why this happened but  some of my friends who watched it were baffled.",1151884800,5,526,5.104651162790698
2440996,4,B000BTH4NQ,"After fulfilling a life ambition of being lucky enough to see the Northern Lights in Kiruna, Sweden, we were very disappointed not to be able to find a DVD about them in one of the best places in the world to see them!

My own digital camera failed to pick up the Northern Lights when we saw them, so this DVD is the best souvenir of the experience we have. It is a quality production which lets us keep the memories alive.

Well worth it!",1142553600,9,439,4.152941176470589
2440997,5,B000BTH4NQ,"I sent for two of these dvd/books arrived when expected, beautifully packaged and did exactly what it said on the ""tin""

Photography stunning, music perfect,  the way to watch this fantastic natural/supernatural phenomena if you can't actually be there.............................  I've seen it from the cockpit of a Boeing 747 flying over the Baring Sea, so whilst not an expert I have enough experience to make my own judgement. buy it and try it for yourself.....",1140393600,14,467,5.2
8092377,3,B000BTH4NQ,"It's okay. A little slow. Maybe its me, but it could have used more Aurora shots.",1414713600,,81,4.125
8092378,4,B000BTH4NQ,"The DVD includes three segments -- one of a scientific/cultural narration about the aurora, one with the symphony The Planets playing behind video shots of incredible aurora displays, and the last segment being a set of still pictures of the aurora.  It was indeed wonderfully shot.  The aurora is notoriously hard to capture on film or digitally.  One you have spent a night watching a live display,  you quickly realize that most photos and video programs are pale representations of the real thing.  The quality in this DVD is quite high.  If you are interested in seeing the aurora in ways that look like what you might see on a crystal clear winter night in Alaska (and without the need for 3 layers of clothing!), this DVD is an excellent option.",1231286400,4,752,4.702290076335878
8092379,5,B000BTH4NQ,"Prepare to hold your breath. I bought this for my husband as a gift but I have enjoyed it as much as he. If you have experienced these great natural wonders be prepared for a refreshing revisit. If you have not done so, prepare for a breath taking wonderous journey through our own reality. Highly recommend this for anyone.",1220313600,,324,4.508474576271187
8092380,5,B000BTH4NQ,"The Northern lights beautifully presented with a soundtrack of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra playing Holst's ""The Planets.""",1205884800,4,131,6.333333333333333
8092381,5,B000BTH4NQ,"This is a BEAUTIFUL dvd!  Well worth the money.  It has fantastic images of the Northern Lights caught on video.  Watching it makes me want to take a trip to Alaska to see it in person.  I've seen the Norhtern Lights here in Washington state, but the they were not as magnificent as the ones captured on this film.  I'm guessing that these images were taped in Alaska, northern Canada, or Iceland.  Truly Beautiful!",1201219200,8,415,4.54054054054054
8092382,5,B000BTH4NQ,"Have you ever looked to the night sky for meteors, constellations, or the elusive Aurora?  This DVD is a must for your collection.  ""The Ultimate Cosmic Experience"" is accurate.  Oh, to have been there when they achieved these wonderful images!  If you have tried to capture the Aurora on film, you know how difficult this task was, and they developed new techniques.  Keep checking NOAA's [..] for the possibility of Auroras in your area, but in the meantime, order this spectacular DVD and buy their Aurora calendar to enjoy still images on your wall at home.",1185321600,,561,4.802083333333333
8092383,5,B000BTH4NQ,"I am so glad I bought this item.  The Aurora has always fascinated me but I never knew how much it moved - plenty of photos but I'd never seen actual 'living' footage of it.  And this DVD bowled me over!

I have got to see the Aurora Borealis before my life is through!

Thanks so much for the excellence of this product and the lovely presentation, including the leaflet in full colour with lots of photos.",1179187200,,407,4.246753246753247
8092384,5,B000BTH4NQ,"How did they do it?  I've seen the Aurora in person once and was awestruck.  It is so hard to describe to someone who has never seen it.  This DVD captures the most incredible images.  In fact, I'm having trouble finding words to describe them.  Trust me, this is a special DVD.",1166313600,5,278,4.269230769230769
8092385,4,B000BTH4NQ,"As I grow older and review experiences I've had and think of ones I'd like to have....the Aurora is one I've missed and would truly like to experience in real life. I've seen volcanoes, walked on glaciers and been half way around our planet but the Aurora is something I think I really need to see before I die. I remember as a little kid nobody knew what caused the phenomenon. Lacking scientific explanation it could almost be construed as ""magic.""  Now with the knowledge of solar plasma ejections and a greater understanding of the earth's magnetic properties I'm convinced....

It is ""magic!"" Having not experienced ""Northern Lights"" personally I appreciated one scene in particular that shows some horses moving in the foreground. It gave me a good feeling of the real-time speed of the light display. I'm sure this DVD pales in comparison to seeing the real thing but it's the best photography and documentation I've seen so far.",1163376000,4,936,4.84375
8092386,5,B000BTH4NQ,"This is a rare, one of the kind scene footages of the northern lights from several locations.  Science and several myths are explained. The charter packaging with booklet is a keepsake.  This footage is rare, as if you were viewing the actual footage of a ""Bigfoot"".  This is excellent for relaxation, meditation and quiet time.  If you have a high definition or other upgraded television the scenes are truly remarkable.  Thank you for sharing your vision and dreams with others.",1161734400,11,480,4.95
