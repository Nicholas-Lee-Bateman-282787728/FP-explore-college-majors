These package with these two movies from 1943/1944 are titled ""A Val Lewton Horror Double Feature"". They are psychological movies that depend on your thinking not on the action, unlike ""The Werewolf"" or ""Frankenstein"" (which are still better movies). They record the culture of that era. [Note the slimness of Simone Simon in TCOTCP, the effects of wartime rationing?] The first movie CP could have been titles ""The Wereleopard"", about a woman who could turn into a black panther when she falls in love with a man. [Is there a symbolic meaning?] A better screenwriter like Curt Siodmak could have made this a better film (like the script of his many horror movies). Note how the lighting is used suggest moods.

Describing these stories would point out the implausibility of their events. The idea of a human turning into a beast occurs in other cultures. ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" is another variation. Was it meant as an anti-alcohol story where a drink turns a man into a monster? I found these stories boring, not scary. Most of the horror stories from the 1930s seem like comedies (to me). One book explained these horror movies as symbols of the Great Depression. ""Frankenstein"" represented the man-made monster of the Great Depression. The Werewolf represented the cyclic economy, where good times are followed by bad times. ""Dracula"" represented a foreign ruler who wanted to exploit England (Kaiser Bill or Der Adolf). Defeating them would save the  people.

The back of the carton said Val Lewton had small budgets and a story based on the film title. Their meager resources are shown by the few actors and simple backgrounds. TCOTCP was designed as a psychological story of fear and fantasy using a ""troubled child"" (one who is rejected by her playmates). This is set in the area of Tarrytown NY and references the story of ""The Headless Horseman"", which is not based on any traditional fold tale. Seeing these films again reminded me how bad they were. Some may disagree, but the real test for any movie is its commercial success. Is there a happy ending? ""I see Irina too."" [Did this inspire the movie ""Harvey""?]

The OPA created rules for Hollywood in 1942. Sets had to be re-used to conserve resources, and lighting was reduced (""film noir""). Civilian production ended and rationing began. The priority was for military production. The ""Special Features"" tells of their background. Some changes were required for British Empire censorship. One interesting item was about King John of Serbia who freed his country from the Mamelukes and purged the witches (following pagan practices?). Few people know about the history of eastern Europe. Vlad Dracula is a national hero of Rumania, he was praised by the Pope of his day for being the only ruler who was not defeated in battle by the Turkish Sultan in the late 15th century (the era of Richard III and Henry VII).
Simone Simon seems to have aged since the earlier movie.",1413331200,,3021,4.824324324324325
