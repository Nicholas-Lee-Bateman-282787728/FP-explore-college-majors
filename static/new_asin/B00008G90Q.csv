7983332,3,B00008G90Q,"Useful instruction video, but little bit too ""straight""l. Helpful for every improvisor, but don't take the advises of Ed Tomasi too literally. Play freely and in your own way with his motivic approach.",1510876800,,201,5.121212121212121
7983333,5,B00008G90Q,"As a practicing jazz musician, if you only buy one educational resource in your career, it should be this one.  Beginners and advanced players alike who want to understand how to construct a jazz solo, will benefit greatly from Tomassi's DVD. Students often ask, I don't know what to play in a solo, or how to develop a solo.  This DVD provides a philosophy and an answer to those questions. Focusing on the ideas of using contrast and balance in a solo, Ed carefully explains what a motivic idea is and how it can be used to create balance and contrast against through-composed material (or bebop ideas).  If people left bad reviews for this DVD, I totally don't get that. No art is created for you....you still have to practice and explore, collect, write, transcribe motivic ideas on your own and work them through all scale patterns and keys, and then apply them to tunes; but Ed does explain very well the process of how to do that. Ed is a world class player and if you listen to his DVD and then listen to him improvise, it will totally make sense how he improvises. He explains in depth 2, 3, and 4 note motives and how to use them.  As a mid career performer and teacher, this DVD created a nearly religious experience for me in answering questions and concerns I had about my own playing, and it completely changed how I practice. The DVD inspired working toward new goals that have a clear direction. I think it is a fantastic resource and should inspire a totally new world for jazz improvisers who want to perform with greater depth and reach listeners in a new way.  At the end of the DVD, ED performs a solo on In a Mellow Tone that is mind blowing, making use of all the motivic ideas he describesI actually found the entire experience quite amazing. I have listened to it over and over. Highly recommended for serious practicing jazz improvisers.",1472601600,,1863,4.516320474777448
7983334,1,B00008G90Q,"If you are someone who is looking for a method book/dvd that explains how motives are composed or improvised...then stay away from this dvd. There isn't any real teaching on how motives are written or any melodic techniques for motives for most of the dvd. The sound of the conversations of the interview, instruction, and music are totally out of sync. Ed Tomassi closes the dvd by saying that ""everything is a motive"". I am just disappointed and I felt like I wasted my money. I am someone who wants to learn hands on stuff and the real thing, when it comes to composition and improvisation. Big Disappointment. My search continues on how motives are written.",1456358400,,661,4.706896551724138
7983335,2,B00008G90Q,"Berklee should be ashamed.  There is almost zero content on this DVD.  Half the time is taken up by a cheesy host who gives a long, unnecessary introduction and then wraps up the DVD by gushing about how great the lesson is. (It's not.)

As for Tomassi, he's obviously a good musician, but he's not so good at articulating his thoughts or his process.  For instance, he doesn't say a thing about how he chooses the notes in his motives.  Are they based on arpeggios from the chord progression?  Are they based on the melody?  Are they random?  He just kind of picks notes, and you have no idea why.  Nor does he explain the idea of what he calls ""Through Compose""; as far as I can tell, this concept just means ""play whatever you want.""

Just as the lesson starts to get interesting and seems like it might be going somewhere, the host tells you it's over.  Really?  It just started.  Even at such a cheap price, it feels like a rip-off.

Two stars instead of one because I like some of Tomassi's playing.  But jeez, Berklee, get your act together.",1421712000,,1048,4.385416666666667
7983336,5,B00008G90Q,"I must say Im impressed at the contents of this Dvd. In just 30 minutes this workshop explains motives, a few notes lick or riff(rigid notes and/or rhythm), which you use to express musicality, and Through composing(loose notes and/or rhythm) improvising around a motive's notes. I apply this to guitar, Tomassi explains it in saxophone, but I understood all of the theory behind it: Pick notes to make a motive, play it rigid for bars then free for a few other bars, then with the chosen notes you can make chord progressions for your backing track (think of it as starting with notes to generate a backing track instead of the other way around, starting with a backing track with chord notes then soloing over those notes). You can make more motives basing it on a previous motive, just modifying it a bit, and try changing it in keys. this is a very powerful method and I felt like I was staring at Mozart's desk while he composed his tunes, there are some excellent examples of motive development in classical music, which is one of my favorite genres!

I recommend you must be familiar with scales, notes, and chords to understand this course, and for actual improvisation some dynamics knowledge is best. This is a mixed course, half tunewriting and half improv, but for instrument expression, the actual innerworkings you can also get Larry Monroe's Jazz Expression A Toolbox for Improvisation. Victor Wooten's The Music Lesson book and Dvd workshop also touches on the 10 elements of music besides just notes!! peace!",1358380800,3,1525,4.820610687022901
7983337,5,B00008G90Q,"Ed Tomassi demystifies a very complex area into very concise rational approach options.
One can watch and rewatch and then begin to apply the same logic to their own practice
and creativity with their own instrument. This is instrument non-specific, so any musician
on any instrument can benefit. This is also a genre non-specific lecture, although it is
titled 'Jazz Improvisation', the concepts can be brought over to many areas of composition
and assist someone reading others compositions to understand the motive developments and
the through composed sections and how they are balanced and integrated. Helps with memorization
of pieces as it helps grid or categorize approach types ~ motive vs. through composed ~ throughout
a piece further defining sections of the whole. Very very powerful beautifully articulated and
worked out method that I find extremely useful. Would like more products like this from Tomassi.",1331856000,3,921,5.358620689655172
