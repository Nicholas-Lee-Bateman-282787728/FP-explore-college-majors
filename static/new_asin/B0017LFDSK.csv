The characters are all lovable (and troublesome) small town people with lovable personalities and funny catchphrases that never fail to deliver some action.

No job is too big or too small for these brave firefighters. Sam and the rest of the firefighters help out by teaching the local kids about camping safety and helping a friend in need who cannot swim.
