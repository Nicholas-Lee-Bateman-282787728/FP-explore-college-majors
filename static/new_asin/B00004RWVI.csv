7921604,1,B00004RWVI,Movie would not play.  Bad experience. Totally dissatisfied.,1489276800,,60,6.5
7921605,1,B00004RWVI,"This is a re-release not the original.  The original release had a lot of bloopers included and made the movie very enjoyable, This re-release just makes it a low budget B movie that isn't worth wasting time watching.",1468540800,,217,4.7105263157894735
7921606,2,B00004RWVI,A perfectly terrible sci-fi flick. While I can't rightfully give it a good rating I will say that the movie is one that is so bad it's entertaining. Worth the watch if you are into bad b movies.,1462924800,,194,4.131578947368421
7921607,5,B00004RWVI,"FOR someone to rate this movie only one star,that person's sound state of mind should be examined! CLEARLY they must be hitting the m eth lab!
This is the greatest movie of all time,way better then lord of the rings,star wars,planet of the apes and the ever so boring dr. who all put together! I would recommend buying this movie in the fourpack set! But if you just wan't a copy of the best movie ever get this,and don't listen to harvey wren jr(he clearly has many mental issues)!",1458345600,2,482,4.426966292134831
7921608,5,B00004RWVI,This movie is just as bad as portrayed. Very campy humor!!,1438992000,,58,4.363636363636363
7921609,1,B00004RWVI,Vincent should have just stayed in retirement since his acting only got worse over time. The story line was worthless and of course there were no decent effects. Don't waste your time unless you're just a big Vincent fan for some crazy reason.,1359072000,,243,4.674418604651163
7921610,2,B00004RWVI,"... and it didn't quite get there.  Fortunately, I watched it for free on TV ... but it cost me time in my life that I can never recover ... far too expensive!",1346457600,,159,3.8181818181818183
7921611,5,B00004RWVI,"With a nice holiday Monday off there is really no better way then to hit up a little late night Sunday B, especially when you have a 9:30 tee time with Santa the next morning. Perusing through some on demand choices proved to be a great choice yet again when we came across the straight to video release known (or not know) as Alienator. After reading the synopsis we were hooked with no knowledge of Michal Jan Vincent being the main role. After about 10 minutes in when he strolled on the set and gave his first line we were absolutely floored with laughter. Now this was before he had his motorcycle accident so he actually didn't look freakish but still had that drunk sounding delivery where you have to rewind just to understand his dialogue. Throughout the movie he delivers nothing outside of one liners....and very poor ones at that. If you can sit through this movie without stomach pains from laughter then you must lack a soul.

O.k this is where you get rammed with a brief synopsis so we ask that you try and follow despite the abnormally confusing premise. Alienator starts off with a toy space ship flying through space inhabited by commander/warden Jan Michael Vincent while on their way to execute an inmate named Kol. On their journey Kol breaks free and forces a shootout with lazer guns (you will not believe these special effects) leaving a few of the space officers dead. Kol then hi-jacks a different toy spaceship and sets sail for planet earth where he meets some horrible acted teens. Now that Jan Michael Vincent has been pushed to the limit he sends the Alienator to earth the retrieve Kol. Somehow Kol builds a bond with the teens and they attempt to take on the alienator, who is nothing more then a beastly weightlifting chick wearing an 80's rocker blond wig. Did you follow any of that?

With Alienator being as confusing as the way we described it can only go one of two ways: 1) A complete nightmare that get's shut off after 20 minutes or 2) A hilarious entry into out vast B library that will never be forgotten. Thankfully for us and all of mankind it was option numero dos. This is a film that should be revered in a the B community the way the Godfather or Cassablanca is for the normal people. On top of all the awful acting, Jan Michael Vincent drunk sounding one liners, and insane special effects you have the fact that this bad boy started up things right from our favorite decade coming out in 1990. The only thing wrong with the Alienator is the fact that we're the only review here in the movies 20 year history.",1283731200,7,2561,4.505376344086022
