8513813,1,B007BGU9TS,amateurish crap. Some of the worst backyard filmmaking I have ever seen. Embarrassingly bad. I hope these idiots sold their cheap camera and decided to get a real job.,1395273600,4,167,4.793103448275862
8513814,1,B007BGU9TS,"I watch about 60 movies a month. I know my movies, especially horror. I'm sad that I actually bought this from reading reviews here. It was one of the worst movies I've ever purchased. The acting was terrible, the music was so loud, you could barely hear what they were saying. No close captions to help with that.

This movie is not worth .1 cent. It was hard to even get through enough of it to make a review of it. I tossed it into the dumpster, and was embarrassed that I wasted the money on it.",1389916800,6,499,4.144329896907217
8513815,5,B007BGU9TS,"A young man was severely abused during childhood from his deranged father. As Michael gets older, he begins to have terrifying nightmares of his past, and he continues to get more-and-more. As he confronts his haunting memories, it begins to affect his everyday living until the nightmares are out of control, and as Michael suffers, so does everyone around him. A madness lurks in this abused man, and the end result is Danger as Michael tries to battle the demons within himself. This movie reminded me very much of ""SYBIL."" A horrifying past and a terrifying dangerous present. This chilling movie is an edge-of-your-seat, spine-tingling thrill ride through the haunted house of horror. Suspense is explosive, acting is excellent, and the events that took place will have you biting your nails. Highly recommended for all thriller and horror lovers!",1339286400,2,852,5.136690647482014

I won't give away the ending but it was quite impressive. I would highly recommend this movie to all horror fans out there:)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quiet-Ones/dp/B007BGU9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quiet Ones</a>",1337731200,2,413,6.811320754716981
8513817,5,B007BGU9TS,Pretty cool! I love well done independent films.  There are aspects of this film that are top dollar moments and I am glad I purchased.  Courtney Gains came out of the corn field for this one and does a great job.,1337212800,2,213,4.170731707317073
