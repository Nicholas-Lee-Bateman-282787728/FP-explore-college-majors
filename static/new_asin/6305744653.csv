1068978,2,6305744653,"Out in Fifty is a low budget straight to video flick. So what? It does the trick. Boy meets girl in bar; boy accidentally kills girl; boy goes to prision; prision cures boy's ills; girl had husband who is rouge cop and wants revenge when he gets out. Typical plot, sure, but this film has redeeming qualities. The cast is decent and provides some good moments. And some of the cinematography is inspired. And, okay, it's dumb, but good dumb.
So basically we are talking about a typical genre film with a few good scenes, and some nifty shots, and it's dumb. I'm not convincing myself to see this movie. But there is a good reason. Why see Out in Fifty? Two words: Mickey Rourke. I won't call it a comeback, but how about a start. Mickey Rourke is an actor. He is so intense, so tortured, he really ruins the rest of the film because no one else can keep pace. Every time he is not in the scene you wish he was. Forget all the stuff he did for the last couple of years and give him another chance. He deserves it. And if we don't, he'll never be in anything else but more Out in Fiftys. He is better than this film. See it and you'll see what I mean.",1050537600,6,1149,4.15695067264574
1068979,2,6305744653,"First of all I'd like to say this is not a great film It is a B movie but it is a very entertaining B movie. It is full of great performances Alexis Arquette has never been better. Scott Leet is perfect as Ray Frye The Convict who gets a second chance at life after spending seven years in the joint for Manslaughter . Now out of jail and back on the street Ray is looking to redeem himself somehow, while being endlessly hounded By Two cops (Mickey Rourke,Peter Green). Ray hooks up with Arquette who gives him a job and a place to live. There Ray meets and falls in love with Arquette's Lovely and lonely wife played by (Nina Ofenbok) Before you know it Ray is tangled in a web of murder and mystrey. They're are several Great Cameos, Ed Lauter , Christina Applegate And Balthazar Getty.",998870400,2,789,4.302013422818792
1068980,5,6305744653,"Concerning the last reader-rating: You should not expect to see Mickey Rourke playing the usual nice guy. I can see strong parallels to Harvey Keitels role in ""Bad Lieutenant"". And Rourke did a brilliant job in portraying a schizoid cop, whose wife has been killed by the young man he his hunting. He has sworn himself to hunt this guy down. And as the young murderer gets out of jail seven years premature, Rourke (""Jack"") goes totally astray. He becomes addicted to drugs (alcohol, pills, cocaine) and reduces all his affords on hunting the ex-con. And this plot isn't even the main plot. The main plot goes about the young ex-con and his problems in getting intergrated back to society. All in all a great movie with committed actors. The soundtrack is brilliant! (I never will forget this scenes, where Jack is sitting in his dark appartment, consuming cocaine and whiskeys - you can literally see him dying internally. THIS is what I call intense acting!)
Unfortunately the DVD comes with no extras at all. Just spanish subtitles.
I apologize for my English.",994982400,9,1063,4.814207650273224
7894354,3,6305744653,If you see who is in this movie before you watch it/  Christina Applegate is featured on the cover of the dvd.  But has a real small role.  She was the reason I wanted to watch this.  Other then that it's not bad.  But it's one of those thar once I saw it.  I don't really want to watch it again.,1513728000,,296,3.7704918032786887

7894357,5,6305744653,I liked this one. But I like a lot of movies with Mickey Rourke in them. He always makes even a mediocre movie better.,1376611200,,118,3.9583333333333335
7894358,2,6305744653,"This movie had some good acting, but pathetic directing.  It is very low budget, and it plays to a tired theme...However, Mickey Rourke was very good.....and there were some cameos (which didn`t help much)..
Scott Leet was trying too hard to be Clint Eastwood. I imagine Mickey did this movie as a favor to some friends.
 Interesting, but a bit of a failure.",1245888000,,358,4.666666666666667
7894359,5,6305744653,"True, this is a B movie. But,  being an exremely successful person in the ""biz"", I can speak with authority and as an artist, clearly stating that MICKEY ROURKE is the greatest american actor. With that said and Rourke's career back on A-list status as the star of SIN CITY and SPUN, it is well worth the price of admission.",1117929600,,324,4.4
7894360,5,6305744653,"Wow!  I wasn't expecting much watching this little movie ""Out In Fifty"" one night at home with my boyfriend.  But then at one point, I totally found myself engrossed watching this guy Scott Leet, who was playing this ex-con trying to get a second chance at life after getting out of prison.  I mean, me and my boyfriend were sitting there like totally in tears and suddenly we realized we were watching this amazing talent.  Scott Leet totally blew us away!

I mean he was totally ripped, totally COOL, totally...just mesmerizing.  He reminded us a lot of a young Clint Eastwood, xcept with lots more vulnerability.  Scott Leet could totally win an Academy Award someday.  He's really amazing.

And gorgeous too.",1115337600,,712,4.818181818181818
7894361,2,6305744653,"OUT IN FIFTY is a ""noirish"" type film written produced and directed by its two leading actors:  Scott Leet and BoJesse Christopher.  Their film is commendable because they don't follow many of the cliches of this genre.  Leet instills his role of Ray Frye with a quiet passion, and although he'll never win any Oscars, his laid back portrayal almost saves the movie.  Unfortunately, Mickey Rourke, the King of Movie Sleaze, portrays a cop that no police department should ever employ.  He is ruthless, vindictive, judgmental, an alcoholic and drug addict, and he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Bojesse meanwhile has a manic Jim Carrey freneticism that works well for a while in his role as Ray's ""savior.""  However, the subplot with him and his seductive sister-in-law comes out of nowhere, and his wife's involvement (Nina Ofenbock) seems pretty far-fetched.  The film ""boasts"" cameos from Christina Applegate (who has two brief scenes), Balthazar Getty (maybe two minutes) and Alexis Arquette (maybe 30 seconds in a stupid drag role).  The ending is a real downer and it proves the old adage, ""Bad guys win every once in a while.""  Although slow paced, the movie isn't boring, just soulless.",1115164800,2,1202,5.055837563451776
7894362,4,6305744653,"I intially first bought this film for $3.00 at Big W and becuase Mickey Rourke is my all time favourite actor. I hadn't seen it before and after purchasing this I saw on the back cover that actor Bojesse Christopher directed it, who I like a lot from many 80's films, he's pretty cool. Looking at the cover I thought that it would probably be just OK, nothing special like so many other films I've seen in my life time.

But this was not the case. Though the feel of it is low budget, it is pretty good. I thought it has a lotta heart about it.

Scott Leet to me was pretty incredable. Leet and his love interest was really interesting. There really was something about this film that is different than a lot of other stuff I've seen.",1105574400,5,734,4.235714285714286
7894363,5,6305744653,"This movie is a GREAT 'no name'. This guy Scott Leet plays the loner perfectly. I've watched this movie twice now on DVD and it has become one of my favorites. Watch it, BUY it, you won't be disappointed.  And at this price it's a Steal.  I hope Leet and his buddy BoJesse make MORE MOVIES. THey got talent.  I enjoyed this movie more than movies I've paid triple the price for. Mickey Rourke plays a real sob perfectly, and the girl Leet falls in love with is captured beautifully.",1088294400,2,482,4.333333333333333
