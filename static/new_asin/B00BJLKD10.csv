8569697,5,B00BJLKD10,"I read other reviews and was kind of worried about buying this. Being a fan of Dynamite Kid, I still bought it. I grew up watching him and Davey Boy, so I knew it should be good.  Dynamite has fallen of the radar of wrestling news and this was very good to see somebody work on getting his fans updated on him.  His skills / talents cant be matched.",1395014400,2,349,4.043478260869565
