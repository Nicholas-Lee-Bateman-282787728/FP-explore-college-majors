8378132,1,B002QXI2N6,"I am posting this review so potential buyers of this DVD are aware that the other five reviews posted to this DVD are NOT for this NEW DVD, conducted by VINCENT DUMESTRE but are for the 2011 WILLIAM CHRISTIE performance. I searched for a way to notify Amazon of this error, but none seems to exist, so I am using this method to inform interested parties that the five reviews posted to this DVD as of June 22, 2015, are for A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE. Maybe someone at Amazon will read this and fix it, meanwhile there are NO reviews yet for this Dumestre performance. If Amazon fixes this, I will delete this ""Review""

I plan to order this DVD on the basis of the high quality of Dumestre's earlier performances of Lully. I expect it will also be excellent.",1434931200,12,766,4.4714285714285715
8378133,4,B002QXI2N6,"There were many good points and many not so good. Although Malena Ernman, the Dido, sings very well and very musically, her physical ""graphics"" in an attempt to act the part become over- acted and actually achieve in making the character of Dido  more than a bit grotesque and less noble. The antics, the facial expression the movements of her body, dotted rhythms that are expressed in convulsive movements: all this so detract from what could have been with better direction, a fine performance. Maltman is excellent both vocally and dramatically and the witches were effective. Adding the girls school was original although not greatly needed. Christie did not disappoint.",1429660800,,675,5.136363636363637
8378134,1,B002QXI2N6,"First known performance of 'Dido and Aeneas' was at a girls' school in London July 1688,although there has been speculation that it might have been written for an earlier performance at the court. The opera was not staged again in Purcell's lifetime.
After 1705 it disappeared as a staged work, with only sporadic concert performances, until 1895 when the first staged version in modern times was performed by students
The reviewed version staged by Deborah Warner and directed by William Christie.

It seems to be all right to transform operas onto modern times. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not. And there are several hybrides. Sometimes - as this one - with ill-dressed ""skinheads"" wearing clothes that has nothing with the opera to do. This particular opera is a cocktail of bad approach, Deborah Warner's disrespectful staging onto a wonderful piece of work which deserves much more perception.
The recording features noisy floor sounds, this I haven't heard in any other blu-ray opera.
Sad to say, but I believe that this is not the last time a director spoils a great opera. Be warned!",1405987200,4,1097,5.060773480662983
8378135,5,B002QXI2N6,"This opera has made Purcell one of my favorites. Malena Emman is great as Dido, the last scene brought tears to my eyes, even the chorus at the very end with the ladies attending Dido is very effective",1389312000,3,201,4.315789473684211
8378136,5,B002QXI2N6,"This is an easy review.  This is a creative new production with a marvelous cast!
1) The music is a masterpiece!
2) William Christie is a master of this era and a great conductor of this repertoire!
3) Every member of this cast is a great actor; including every member of the chorus.
4) The stage director-Deborah Warner gets wonderful and detailed facial expression from the entire cast and ensemble.  All involved truly live the moment.
5) The two leads (Malena Ernman as Dido and Christopher Maltman as Aeneas) are two credible lovers.  She is also a spectacular and expressive singer.  Her dynamic control and phrasing are truly classic.  He is very, very fine as well.
6) The children really work as an ensemble and especially in the dance moments, with the chorus and especially with the Sorceress and her witches.
7) The Sorceress, Hilary Summers is a ""camp"" hoot.  Some reviewers may scoff at this; but it is an acceptable solution to the problem of how to interpret this character and stage the witch's scene.
8) The two witches are also of the same mold and work very well.
9) Belinda-Judith van Wanroij has much beautiful music to sing and does a lovely job with all of it.
10) The costumes work well as does the basic unit set.  The nave of a Gothic Chapel?
11) I first experienced this great (short) masterpeice in my first Semester of Music & Western Civilization taught by Dr. Robert Crone at Duquesne University's School Of Music.  He managed in that excellent class to inspire many of us to love this BAROQUE GEM! Thank You, Dr. Crone.  It is really too bad that we didn't have DVDs or Blu-Rays of such Historically Informed Performances back then.  We made do with the wonderful EMI Recording with Victoria de los Angeles; a quite good recording  for it's time.  I highly reccomend this Production to all looking for a Video Recording of this small Baroque Masterwork by a great Baroque composer, Henry Purcell, Who like Mozart died way too young!",1357689600,11,1965,4.680232558139535
8378137,5,B002QXI2N6,"I am totally in favor of this recording (unlike the prevoius commentator) From the beginning, when we see the prologue spoken by Fiona Shaw linking together several myths of ancient Greece with so much wit and panache, we realize that we will have a great artistic experience through the entire show.

The little children who so much annoyed the previous commentator, are nothing more, nothing less, what Purcell had in mind when he composed the opera to be performed at the Josias Priest's girls' school in London in 1688. They do not harm the performance; on the contrary, they add commedy, drama, pathos when and wherever is needed.
The singers are for the most part outstanding and very aware of the baroqque style of singing (little vibrato in the voice and no trills). The short and thankless part of Aeneas is taken by Christopher Maltman, who rally looks like he is in love with Dido and annoyed by being a pawn of the gods and sings with conviction. And the Dido of Malena Erman is superb! What control of breath and legato. And listen to her pianissimi during the lament. I was very impressed and she gets 5 stars for her performance. The sorceress and her witches don't awake terror (which the previous commentator so much missed) but I am happy with the tremendous irony, arrogance, and humor that they bring to the stage everytime they are on it.

William Chritie and his Les Arts Florissants are nothing short of magnificent. I already knew his approach thanks to the CD recording that he and his forces had recorded about a decade ago, and I knew what I was going to get and I am not disapointed. He excells in this repertory and if he re-touched the score, even better, since he knows and he is capable. On the other hand, that is normally done since there is no definitive score of Dido and Aeneas.

Stage production and direction is what one can expect after the Eurotrash revolution (for the most part, thankfully, in the past): Victorian dresses and minimal staging. Direction is straight and believable.

I loved this set and highly recommend it!",1311465600,16,2067,4.68595041322314
