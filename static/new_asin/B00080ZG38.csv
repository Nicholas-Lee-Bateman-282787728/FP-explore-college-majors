8055144,3,B00080ZG38,Kind of what I expected but still a good see. Not to many twists but your standard movie. Take a couple of hours and have a see,1394150400,,127,3.740740740740741
8055145,1,B00080ZG38,"This movie, also known as ""Peak Experience,"" is a confused, silly mess.  It makes the grade only as a ""so bad it's good""/""what were they thinking?"" curiosity piece.

Normally I would not bother making a review for a video such as this, but I wanted to offset the two ridiculously glowing reviews that it received here, presumably from the DVD distributors.  At least one of them had enough shame to refrain from giving it five stars.",1193356800,4,433,4.671052631578948
8055146,5,B00080ZG38,"This film is a mindbending adventure story.  At first I thought if was just an exciting and sexy thriller.  But as the story progressed it became more and more mysterious and exhilerating.  It's an enigmatic film.  I've watched it twice now and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  If you're looking for something new, check out Lost Lake.",1186617600,,350,4.672131147540983
8055147,4,B00080ZG38,"LOST LAKE is a unique, mystical adventure story shot in the the high Sierra mountains.  Definitely not a cookie-cuttter film, Lost Lake is a good example of what independent filmmaking used to be before it was coopted by the studios.  Fun, sexy, thought-provoking entertainment with excellent acting and dialogue.  Give it a try.  Highly recommended.",1186444800,,350,5.3090909090909095
8055148,1,B00080ZG38,"Lets be honest, I bought the movie because of Angel Boris and not much else. What I got was a little of Angel Boris and not much else. So all my expectations should be matched? Hmm, not really. I would expect even a basic nice story of any movie, but this movie left no impression at all. It is kind of a movie that you'll just forget after you took the DVD out of the player.

1 Star for Angel Boris, 0 for the storyline.",1163462400,2,422,3.9647058823529413
