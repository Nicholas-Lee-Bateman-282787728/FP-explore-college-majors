8440373,5,B004T0Z6GU,"A taste of contemporary Korea with a touch of humour. This movie has an interesting twist at the end of the movie as the storylines weave together. There's something for everyone. It's entertaining, amusing, thought-provoking. I can see why Hollywood is interested, but I don't think a re-make will be as good as the original. Well done to all involved - it's a great watch.",1334102400,,374,4.769230769230769
8440374,5,B004T0Z6GU,"For those of you who appreciate foreign films, this is highly recommended!  There are typical zany moments as most Asian films provide, but then comes the twist!  It was a favorite among many of my fellow friends who are avid film festival buffs.",1327881600,,246,4.6976744186046515
8440375,5,B004T0Z6GU,"I just saw this at an Asian Film Festival and this is a movie you don't want to miss. I already love Korean story telling and here they go again--somehow this wonderful film manages to combine death, suicide, comedy, romance, life, loss, appreciation for family all in one heartwarming, heartbreaking tale. If you enjoyed ""Sassy Girl"" a while back (02?) you will love this.",1319500800,3,373,4.84375
8440376,2,B004T0Z6GU,"Fist off... Movie is AMAZING! I know because I saw it on a Korean Air flight, so I saw this with very good quality subtitles...
Bought this DVD to show the movie to my family. This movie is TOTALLY RUINED by the quality of translation and subtitles... Totally broken english.
The menu for audio and subtitles has English 5.1, and English 2.0... BOTH are Korean audio! Im surprised they got the 5.1 and 2.0 correct though, that gives this movie a star to 2.
I give 5 stars for the movie alone, but the poor workmanship on this DVD is REALLY BAD! So the product, to a person who has never seen this and is not korean would not understand this, deserves a 2.
The second star would be video quality and audio quality... If you know Korean, you can still buy it and understand it and enjoy it.",1315008000,7,788,4.295302013422819
