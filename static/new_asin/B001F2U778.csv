3562297,1,B001F2U778,"Honestly who put this pack together??? But more importantly was there really a NEED for it?  An who green-lighted this company time waster? With all of the great movies still not on blu-ray I'm mystified as to why garbage like this gets put out.  Decisions like this are precisely why CEO's are being laid off and there is a $700 billion dollar bail out package from the U.S. Government that companies are wanting a piece of.

It's funny to actually realize that customers never saw garbage like this when Blu-ray was at war with HD-DVD. Now that Blu-Ray has conquered, it seems ok to openly publish Blu-Ray 'mistakes'. (Perhaps trying to get thier own piece of the 700 billion bail out).

What's even more atrocious is the pricing 299.99 Retail? Yeah, like they're really going to get that much for it. They might as well have put a price tag of $3,000,000.00 but on sale for $5.00 to try to convince me that I am getting a deal, I still would not buy this junk!

I'm more likely to purchase 20 BLANK Writeable Blu Rays at $70.00, than 20 Blu-Rays in a package that the studios have obviously wasted resources, employees and company time recording on Blu-Ray.

This is a much better package produced for standard DVD (If At All) and sale priced around $10.00....MAYBE.

Final Rating:
It's garbage like this companies keep producing that is weighing down all of the continents that keeps them slowly sinking into the ocean, much like the National Geographics. Definitely worth passing up.",1226966400,16,1488,4.722007722007722

3562299,1,B001F2U778,"You Save: $79.04 (53%)

Look at the list of movies you get. I would say $70 overpriced. With the current poor economy, I expect the all of the Bluray movie collection and players drop 53% by Christmas.

Save yourself a potential lawsuit and jail time and present this alternative instead.  Trust me, the message will be delivered just as strongly as a steaming bag of poop.
Thank you Amazon, you really do look out for us all.

P.S. If you do decide to give this gift, grab the Angel in the Family starring Meredith Baxter disc for yourself....Some of the hottest ABC Family smut you can find...may be worth the price of the cube alone and NO ONE in the know will ever question your possessing this gem in your collection.

If this value pack were a joke it would be pretty funny. The fact that its for real makes it twice as funny! And for anybody that doesn't know; Artie Lange's Beer League is a very funny movie! It is the only keeper in the bunch. Hell, its the only one of the bunch I've even heard of. I doubt it really benefits from being on blu ray so pick it up cheap on dvd or rent it.",1229385600,6,494,4.0
3562344,1,B001F2U778,"I know, I know. I got all excited when I first saw this bundle myself. But after further review, I guess this bundle is for the person who likes to say ""Hey, Look how many Blu-rays I have""!

These movies are a poor version of audio/video quality for blu-ray. Kind of like dubbing your 8-tracks tapes onto CD. Yes they will play in a CD player but, they will sound like poop.

And let's face it, the movie selection is ... well ... you know.
Have you heard of any of these movies? No. And you know why, RIGHT?!

Pure poop, That's why!!",1229126400,13,534,4.165048543689321
3562345,3,B001F2U778,"One has to figure out the value, you are paying about 3.75 for each blu-ray here. I've watched some of the titles like Poseidon Adventure, Mysterious Island, 10.5 Apocalypse, and they are not complete duds. I don't know about all of the titles in the set, but it is nice to see several companies offering value blu-rays instead of 20-30.00 per title. This is a necessary niche in a format. The Big White and a few others are not bad movies at all.......at this price, I think it's worth it.",1229126400,8,490,4.455555555555556
3562346,1,B001F2U778,"If you are looking to buy a gift or a few movies for someone who wants Blu-ray movies, you HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.  I would not buy this cube if it was $20.00, I don't think I would buy it for $10.00.  These are overpriced movies that are so bad, I still can't believe that they wasted all of that plastic to produce these movies and package them and the ink for the covers.  Seriously, the title selection is very very very bad.  These are movies that no one bought on DVD at the $2.00 DVD sale.  If you were to give this gift to someone, they would see that the box says Bluecube and their heart may begin to skip a beat with excitement, which would quickly give way to a huge dissappointment.  Merry Christmas!",1228867200,53,711,4.1911764705882355
3562347,1,B001F2U778,"When the primary attraction to a product is that you are getting a $300 ""value"" for $75, you likely aren't.  Ask yourself how they can afford to stay in business, if this truly is a $300 ""value"".  In my opinion, this 20 disc set isn't even worth $20.

The included titles, hardly are ones to take advantage of the benefits of Blu-ray in the first place, let alone ones that are considered highly desirable.  At $3.75 per disc, you would be better off looking for inexpensive DVDs, and making sure that your Blu-ray player will also play DVDs.  Then, buy the titles you actually want, as opposed to the titles that are being ""dumped"" at a ""fire sale"".

The whole purpose of Blu-ray is to offer the capability of having more special features, and higher quality for today's 1080p TVs and projectors.  This set defeats that core purpose pretty handily.  Never mind the fact that all of these titles are movies that didn't sell well to begin with.

The included titles are:

 1. The Big White
 2. Supernova
 3. Category 7: The End of the World
 4. Mortuary
 5. Cruel World
 6. The Colt
 7. The Last Sentinel
 8. Mysterious Island
 9. Beer League
10. Blackbeard
11. The Poseidon Adventure
12. Final Days of Planet Earth
13. The Woods Have Eyes
14. 10.5 Apocalypse
15. The Final Patient
16. The Ten Commandments
17. Salem Witch Trials
18. Salvage
19. Angel in the Family
20. The Curse of King Tut's Tomb

Amazon even has a 10-disc version of this set that is cheaper, per disc!  So, what's the point of getting THIS version?  Save your money!  Let wasteful spending be an exclusive purview of politicians.",1228867200,149,1599,4.552816901408451

3562369,2,B001F2U778,"Echo Bridge Home Entertainment sells these titles individually at around $10-13 each. There is value with this deal of 20 made for tv movies & mini-series. However, content is so subjective in a review so I'll just point out what I know about them. Most of the mini-series discs run close to 3 hours. No lossless soundtracks on any titles. Audio options average per title at 2 channel dolby or 2 channel LPCM with a few that have 1.5mbps dts. Each title is 1080p MPEG-2 encoded. I've watched most listed here & the video quality isn't that of a major motion picture studio title.
