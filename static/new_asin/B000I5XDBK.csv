8144056,3,B000I5XDBK,"A meth dealer who drives a station wagon with cool wood side panels and a nifty luggage rack kills a man who stole from him and then he pushes Harley (Brett Chukerman) into a pit, a kid who is deaf. Soon people start dying, but we never see the killer.

The plot is okay as a slasher and the dialouge needed refinement. The slasher effects were noticeably low budget as was the stage hand in the orange shirt reflecting in our drug dealers mirror shades. The writers made Venus (Delia Copold) too weird to be believable, with the remaining cast being under developed.

Nice strip tease by Janet Tracy Keijser and good film of a stationary lizard on a rock. Neither of which related to the plot, but one was less wasted footage than the other.
