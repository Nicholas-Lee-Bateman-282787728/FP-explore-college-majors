8330977,5,B001ONSWMU,"This would be a worthwhile comedy to watch, even without the music.  It is side splitting funny.  I think funnier than Cosi fan Tutte.  There are plenty of sight gags.  The acting and interaction between characters is excellent.  This production has one of the best operatic sets I have ever seen.  I am going to try to search out more productions from Teatro Real de Madrid.  The melodic line sounds like it could have come from Mozart but the two arias that Mozart wrote for the 1789 revival of the work show a  clear superiority - more modulations, counterpoint and imaginative writing for wind instruments than in the rest of the opera.",1430524800,,640,4.651785714285714
8330978,5,B001ONSWMU,"It is refreshing to have dvds of operas by less well known composers, and this is an excellent production of an opera worth seeing and hearing today. It is well sung and acted. The direction makes sense of the libretto, and it is clearly filmed and recorded. I would love to be able to buy dvds of the 2 other Da Ponte operas by Soler at a reasonable price. Five stars for a good start towards this goal.",1396483200,,404,4.1923076923076925

8330981,5,B001ONSWMU,"Our Burbero (Grouch) is a wealthy bachelor misanthrope, whose bad temper makes him the terror of his friends and servants, and especially of his two wards, his nephew and niece. The nephew is a charming fool whose extravagant wife has squandered both his and his sister's inheritance. The shy, adorable niece is in love but afraid to tell her uncle. It's a plot that could easily be adapted today as a TV sitcom or a French comic bourgeois cinema. In fact, the libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte was adapted from a French-language stage comedy by Carlo Goldoni. Da Ponte was busy in 1786/87 in Vienna, working simultaneously on librettos for Antonio Salieri, Amadeo Mozart (Nozze di Figaro), and three (3!) for Vincenzo Martini aka Vicente Martn y Soler. Librettists get too little notice posthumously in the world of opera. Da Ponte was at least as acclaimed and influential as any composer in his own era, and the dramatic craft of his librettos deserves a large share of the credit for the quality of the comic operas of both Mozart and Martn.

If the music of Il Burbero di Buon Cuore reminds you strongly of Mozart, if shouldn't come as a surprise. Mozart (1756-1791) and Martn y Soler (1754-1806) were exact contemporaries, both of whom composed in the fashionable musical vocabulary of their era. In fact, they collaborated, and Mozart was not embarrassed to borrow material from earlier operas by Martn for his greatest masterpieces, Don Giovanni and Magic Flute. Two of the arias in Il Burbero, both sung by Veronique Gens in the role of the extravagant wife Lucilla, were indeed composed by Mozart to suit the skills of a specific soprano. On the whole, Martn's finest musical moments are not his arias but his ensemble pieces, which foreshadow the best hysterical quintets of the much later Rossini comic operas. It could be argued that Mozart took a lesson from Martn about the merits of ensemble; Cos Fan Tutti, composed in 1790, is the Mozart opera devoting the most attention to duets and larger ensembles of singers. It's also the opera that bears the closest resemblance to Il Burbero di Buon Cuore, both dramatically and musically.

The music of Il Burbero is extraordinarily vivacious. Let me declare foolhardily: if this opera were the work of Mozart, it would rank well along with Cos and Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail and would be produced regularly by all the major opera companies of the world. Il Burbero is a very successful piece of musical theater!

This 2007 production by the Teatro real of Madrid is artful enough to serve as a template for any and all productions of operas by Mozart and his contemporaries. It's staged in modern dress and setting, but with zero self-consciousness and not even a whiff of post-modernist directorial ego. The acting by all eight singers is fully cinematic; Carlos Chausson, in the role of the grumpy Feramondo, gives an Oscar-worthy performance as well as singing excellently. The young lovers Angelica and Valerio - sung by Elena de la Merced and Juan Francisco Gatell - make a gorgeous/handsome couple, act with consummate style, and sing with equal skill. The most outstanding singing, as one might expect, comes from Veronique Gens as the squanderous Lucilla. The most overtly ""commedia dell'arte"" character in the opera, the middle-aged friend of Uncle Ferramondo, is sung skillfully by the veteran Luca Pisaroni, who sustains the fluent naturalism of the drama by not exaggerating his ridiculous position as a reluctant suitor. Yes, he could be funnier, more bizarre, but not without disrupting the semi-realistic dramaturgy.

I love this cast! There are some future super-stars here. I love this production! As I said above, it could be a model for how to stage 18th C operas for the pleasure of opera audiences rather than the gratification of stage director and costumers. I love this music! It doesn't, to my mind, detract from the genius of Amadeo Mozart to recognize that there were other composers writing in the same manner and with similar skill in the same milieu.

Vicente Martn y Soler moved on from Vienna to Saint Petersburg in 1788, in the service of Catherine the Great, with whom he actually collaborated on a Russian-language opera, one of three that he composed there. In 1795, he moved again, to London, where he composed yet three more Italian operas. Wow! We have intriguing possibilities to look forward to. There is another Martn opera already available on DVD:

8330983,5,B001ONSWMU,"Il Burbero di buon cuore (The kindhearted grumpy old men) is a comic opera that was composed by Vicente Martn y Soler to a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, based on one of the most popular and amusing French comedies by Carlo Goldoni, Le bourru bienfaisant. A new DVD version for this rare opera appeared lately on the Italian label Dynamic from a production at the Teatro Real in Madrid 2007.

A few sentences synopsis: The quick-tempered Ferramondo needs to deal with his nephew Giocondo that lost his fortune due to his wasteful wife Lucilla. Therefore he wants to send his young sister Angelica to a monastery in order to use her dowry. Angelica is in love with young Valerio. But Ferramondo wants to marry her with his friend Dorval with whom he plays chess in order to guard the dowry for himself. In the end, Marina, the old cunning nanny helps the young couple to persuade Ferramondo to let them marry, not before that he complains that everyone is forcing him to do whatever they want... This is high quality libretto like the three da Ponte created for Mozart.

Vicente Martn y Soler that was two years older than Mozart, was born in Valencia in 1754. In Europe he became known as Vincenzo Martini, an Italian name he adopted to facilitate his success in the world of music. When met da Ponte in 1785, he had already managed to write 12 operas. But it was a remarkable leap to his career as an opera composer after he settled in Vienna and started his collaboration with da Ponte that wrote for him Libretti for three operas: Il burbero di buon cuore (1786), Una cosa rara (1786) and L'arbore di Diana (1787). Those operas brought him a big success with the Viennese audience alongside the operas that Mozart wrote to da Ponte's libretti. It is well known that Mozart quotes in Don Giovanni a theme from Soler's opera Una cosa rara.

The first performance of Il Burbero di buon cuore in Vienna in 1786 was a big success by right of the entertaining text and the music, which is simple but charming. In October 1789, Mozart wrote two alternative arias for this opera by Soler:
Chi sa, chi sa qual sia KV 582
Vado, ma dove? Oh Dei! KV 583

The opera was presented in Madrid for the last time in1792. In 2007 the opera was performed at the Teatro Real in Madrid after more than two hundred year of absence from the stage. Stage director was Irina Brook, daughter of the director Peter Brook. The occurrence in the opera was updated to modern times impressively and persuasively. The stage is designed with a single rich set which looks like a lobby of little hotel.

Christophe Rousset conducts the orchestra of the Teatro Real and he plays also the harpsichord in the recitatives. As he is a baroque specialist he gets from the orchestra stylistic playing, which is both transparent and brilliant. The music is very amiable and pleasant. Ii seems to me as a mixture of middle Mozart (operas like La Finta Giardiniera) with spicing of Rossini, like the use of crescendo in the end of Valerio's first aria. Some of the musical numbers are especially beautiful, like Angelica and Dorval duet in the second act.

All the eight soloists are excellent singers with no exception. Bass Carlos Chausson sings the leading role of Ferramondo. He sings very well and is an outstanding comical actor. Soprano Elena de la Merced sings the role of Angelica. She has fabulous voice and an exquisite singing technique. It is pure delight every time that she opens hers mouth. Her recitative and big aria in the second act are extremely beautiful. It is almost Mozart... Another outstanding soprano, Veronique Gens, sings the part of Madama Lucilla, and she sings the two charming arias that Mozart wrote for this Soler opera.

There are two tenors: Samir Pirgu is a good Giocondo and Juan Francisco Gatell is a very good Valerio. He has a beautiful lyric tenor voice, which is ideal for Mozart and Rossini roles. The two baritones are also fine: Luka Pisaroni as Dorval and Josep Miquel Ramn as the hilarious butler Castagna. Closing the list is mezzo Cecilia Daz as the wily nanny Marina.

Undoubtedly, the extraordinarily phenomenon called Mozart darkened quite a few talented composers that worked in his period but are now almost forgotten. Soler is one example. This is a charming piece of music, and the performance is very good from every points of view.",1238198400,27,4349,4.6758169934640526
