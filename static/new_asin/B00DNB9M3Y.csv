8594693,1,B00DNB9M3Y,"The instructions aren't clear enough. She just jumps right into the moves without working toward them. Quite frustrating. I am very disappointed and felt like I wasted money. It has potential, they need to redo it in a more organized way. Especially for beginners!",1508889600,,264,5.0227272727272725
8594694,3,B00DNB9M3Y,I like the way the moves are broken down before you actually start the dance routine. Yendi and the dancers do a good job of breaking down the steps. The flip side is that some of these moves require a level of coordination that not everyone possesses. If you don't get the steps the routine is impossible and not much of a work out.  Once you get the moves it's a fun time! I wished they used some more contemporary dancehall songs though.,1484524800,,440,4.301204819277109

8594700,1,B00DNB9M3Y,Horrible! Just horrible! The color of the video was way too much - distracting. The video was extremely pixilated and this was some boring Jamaican dance/exercise routine. I contacted the seller and he said he would give me some return shipping stamp that never showed. I was so upset that I couldn't stand the sight of the video anymore so I threw it in the trash.,1415318400,,365,4.545454545454546
