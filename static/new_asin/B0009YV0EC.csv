8070558,5,B0009YV0EC,"""Fear In A Desert City"" represents the premiere episode of one of the finest television dramas ever to grace the small screen -- ""The Fugitive"", starring David Janssen as ""Dr. Richard Kimble"", the physician who was falsely accused of murdering his wife, Helen (played a few times during the series by the lovely actress Diane Brewster, who also portrayed ""Beaver"" Cleaver's first school teacher, ""Miss Canfield"", in another Classic TV series, ""Leave It To Beaver"").

This debut episode of ""The Fugitive"" is a winner in my book. It features Brian Keith and Vera Miles as the primary guest stars -- both of whom are terrific in their roles here (particularly Keith, who is savagely menacing and brutal, to the point of being downright scary).

SOME ""FUGE FACTS"", SERIES INFO, AND TRIVIA:

>> Kimble's first alias was ""James Lincoln"" (used in this pilot episode).

>> ""Fear In A Desert City"" was first broadcast (on ABC-TV) on Tuesday night, September 17, 1963 (at 10:00 PM, Eastern Time).

>> ""The Fugitive"" lasted for four fabulous seasons (1963-1967), with a total of 120 episodes aired. (The first three seasons were broadcast in Black-and-White; while the fourth and final season was shown in ""Living Color"".  A little bit of ""edge"" and atmosphere were lost during the final color campaign, IMO. But, still, many first-rate episodes are included during the final year as well.)

>> Dr. Kimble saves the life of Lt. Philip Gerard, the man desperately attempting to re-capture Kimble, in FIVE separate episodes during the series' four years on the air. One show, in fact, has Kimble TWICE rescuing Gerard from near-certain death!  While the frequent life-saving episodes during the series are indeed a tad on the unrealistic side, they did offer up some of the best dramatic moments in the series.

>> The character of Philip Gerard (portrayed by Barry Morse, who seemed born to play the part) actually appeared in only 37 of the 120 episodes during the series (not counting the opening credits, during which he's always shown). Although it ""seemed"" like he was in many more. Gerard's ""presence"" is felt in nearly every episode however. But in most of the shows he's not physically shown on camera.

>> The ""one-armed man"" was played by Bill Raisch, who really did have one arm missing. He lost part of his right arm during World War II, after being badly burned while fighting a fire.

If you're a big fan (or even a casual fan) of ""The Fugitive"", I'd recommend picking up this VHS video containing the outstanding premiere episode. I'd also recommend the ""companion book"", entitled ""The Fugitive Recaptured"" (by Ed Robertson). That volume contains a complete episode guide, with very detailed information on every show, including an abundance of interesting trivia and photographs.",1125360000,7,2783,5.0021645021645025
