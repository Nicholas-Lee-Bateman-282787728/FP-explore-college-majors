7553450,5,B018J280E8,Why o Why do they make a great TV show and then the producers cancel it What is the matter with them i was so looking forward to the next series and have just found out they have cancel it. This was one of the best shows on TV the actors were all great and belivable Iam so fed up with these stupid people who keep on making bad decisions,1458691200,,338,3.842857142857143
7553451,5,B018J280E8,"This show is one of the best ever put on tv.  The cast is a great team of misfits who get the job done.  Dean Winters is the stand out actor in the show,  his talent of playing the offbeat characters is amazing.  His sarcastic personality fills the show with so much humor and Josh Duhamel plays a great straight man.  There is great chemistry between Dean and Josh who play the lead characters.  Had this show actually been promoted by CBS I am sure that we would all be looking forward to the upcoming 2nd season.  There are so many people out there who had never even heard of this show until I told them about it.  They have all told me if they had known this show was on the air they would have watched it!!!  This makes me think that they could have had a much much larger audience if they had just done a little thing called promotion!!!!!  Battle Creek forever!!",1456185600,,870,4.218181818181818
7553452,5,B018J280E8,"Have only seen this show in the last week and have now watched the 13 episodes that are available to stream. I am completely taken with every character and was equally in love with Milt, Russ, and Holly. The writing is fantastic. I was completely taken in by the interplay between the two leads especially. They played amazingly well off of each other, and I would have been completely engrossed in watching their relationship evolve over several seasons. This is an excellent drama with comedic overtones that are simply genius. I will definitely rewatch what is available and mourn the possibilities that will never be realized since CBS gave up on it. I wish they had given it a greater opportunity to gain a fan base.

As of this writing, 01/29/2016, there is no blu-ray offering.  Hopefully, this changes, but regardless, the show was/is fantastic.",1454025600,,853,4.875862068965517
7553453,5,B018J280E8,"A great show. Excellent cast, particularly the two leads, good character development and relationships, interesting scripts. Total wrong move to cancel. How can this show be cancelled and junk like 'the mysteries of laura' get a second season?",1452729600,4,243,5.421052631578948
7553454,5,B018J280E8,"I was very disappointed when this show was not given the chance for a second season. I get tired of the network 'suits' cancelling great shows and leaving garbage on for years. Maybe the viewing audience assumed this was just another standard cop show [not the case] and the Sunday night time slot seems to be reserved for shows the network doesn't have confidence in.  For me, that couldn't be farther from the truth. Mr. Winters may be known to you as 'Mayhem' in the insurance commercials and a stint on Law & Order SVU and, of course, Mr Duhamel has a lengthy TV resume.
I can not get enough of Mr Winter's sardonic demeanor....he played his mayhem part deliciously.  And Mr Duhamel was able to play up his 'pretty boy' reputation precisely -  their chemistry was a delight to watch.  I love the supporting cast as well......glad to own it on DVD.",1452643200,12,851,4.542483660130719
7553455,5,B018J280E8,"Despite it's cruel cancellation, the show's lone season stands on it's own as a good self contained story. Duhamel is great as the edgy but outwardly friendly FBI Ubmensch Milt but Dean Winters steals the entire show as a down-on-his-luck, poorly funded bad ass who has tried desperately to hold together a broken down Midwestern police force all by himself. When the DVD comes out, no matter it's quality, watch it.",1452470400,8,416,4.873239436619718
7553456,5,B018J280E8,Just loved it!!  Had to have it!  Best price around!,1498348800,,52,4.1
7553457,2,B018J280E8,"The version we received seems to have been written by criminals who hate police!  They are characterized as alcoholics, drug addicts, sex addicts, hot tempered Irish know-it-alls and generally despicable characters in this series. Could have been a terrific story, but it isn't.",1489968000,,278,5.465116279069767

7553459,5,B018J280E8,I'm so sad we only got one season of this series.,1488412800,2,49,3.5454545454545454
7553460,5,B018J280E8,I hate that they canceled this show!!!,1486598400,,38,4.571428571428571
7553461,5,B018J280E8,This excellent television show wasn't given a chance. The acting is great and it is very funny. We love watching it.,1485561600,,116,4.571428571428571
7553462,5,B018J280E8,"I loved Battle Creek.  Dean Winters and Josh Duhamel were great in it!  Sunday night was a horrible time slot for a new show.  It kept getting delayed by football so it was hard to find.  Still, I persevered.  I was ticked when CBS cancelled it. When I found out they kept NCIS: NOLA I couldn't believe it.  I thought Battle Creek was a much better show.  At least I have the one season.  sigh...",1481328000,4,396,4.1866666666666665
7553463,5,B018J280E8,Finally after watching it properly I miss the show so much!!!!! Josh and Dean are literally so freaking talented it makes me sad that the network didn't see that yet at least we fans of the show all did. Thank you Amazon for making it available to buy online. :D,1480896000,2,262,4.26
7553464,5,B018J280E8,I am glad to have Battle Creek in my collection.  So sorry it was taken off the air.  I found it to have great story lines and an even better cast of characters.  Buying this dvd is my way of trying to support those that made this show the success that I know that it was.,1479081600,3,272,3.8214285714285716
7553465,5,B018J280E8,"Yet again, the morons running the networks can't see quality programming in front of their own noses. ""Battle Creek"" is yet another victim of a system that would rather broadcast cheap garbage like UNreality programming, than give a brilliantly conceived, written and acted show a chance to build a regular audience.",1469404800,,316,5.215686274509804
7553466,5,B018J280E8,I love this series.  So sad it was cancelled.  Nice stories and interesting characters.,1469232000,,87,5.142857142857143
7553467,4,B018J280E8,"Excellent series, canceled too soon. But if anyone in your family needs closed-captioning (English subtitles), these DVDs do not offer it. Minus one star for this insensitivity to those with hearing loss.",1468800000,,204,5.40625
7553468,5,B018J280E8,"Loved this show, miss it so much, and will buy the DVD soon.  Can someone tell me if there are English subtitles?  The Amazon-produced Common Law didn't and I prefer having them.",1464739200,,178,4.53125
7553469,5,B018J280E8,I recorded the last half of the season and deep regret not having recorded every second.  It was both fun and dramatic.  It never ceases to amaze me how programming wizards can and do make horrible decisions in which shows to renew and which to cancel.  I really liked this series.  Now ask me which ones I can live without.,1464652800,,324,4.35
7553470,5,B018J280E8,Yes it met our expectations,1463270400,,27,4.6
7553471,5,B018J280E8,I was so happy when this came out on DVD.  It is so funny and I don't understand why they took it off the air.  (Idiots),1463097600,,120,3.576923076923077
7553472,5,B018J280E8,This is an incredible series that I am SO SAD is off the air.  The story lines are good - the writing is snappy - the acting is great.  Can't ask for better than that.  Have no idea why someone thought this series should end and crap like the diva housewives or media-seeking families are allowed to continue.,1462665600,,309,4.293103448275862
7553473,5,B018J280E8,"Makes me crazy they could not get this into a long running series.  The humor, the characters, even the plight of some hard hit cities were lovingly told in a humorous manner.  Cute actors, great humor, well written episodes....glad to have a permanent copy if the companies were stupid enough to cancel the series.",1461196800,,315,4.814814814814815
7553474,5,B018J280E8,"My wife & I couldn't agree more with the preceding positive reviews. All of them. I even understand the idea of one reviewer that the show's early cancellation necessitated/allowed for the dramatic finale we found quite moving, nearly perfect and, except for the hated cancellation, satisfying. That said, we'd have loved a second season of this fine dramedy. If the cancellation resulted, as has been suggested, from the network's failure to adequately promote BC then it's another case of --- to paraphrase Henry Higgins from My Fair Lady --- silly people not knowing their own silly business. Even if we do have to thank the ""suits"" for the well written, well acted episodes they allowed. We just can't help but wonder what the writers and well cast ensemble could have done with a 2d season, whether they took their spiritually beleaguered characters beyond ""Sympathy for the Devil"" (the finale) or simply kicked that episode further down the road.",1460851200,,952,5.031645569620253
7553475,5,B018J280E8,"Thank you, Amazon! This short-lived series had so much going for it, but one could see where it was so much different than the typical CBS crime show. The emotionally beaten down Russ Agnew of the Battle Creek Police can't stand ""Mr. Perfect"" FBI agent Milt Chamberlain, sent to my home town for reasons he doesn't want to reveal - so you get two mysteries in one. While the ""Odd Couple"" of cops try to out-do each other to solve a crime (shoe leather vs. high tech), there's also the hunt by every member of the BC police to discover Milt's secret. It's a mixed blessing that CBS did not renew this, as the early cancellation led to a great dramatic conclusion story. If this show had gone on and on, we might have tired of the story line. Depending on your sense of humor, there are also good laughs in every story. What really sells this show is excellent performances by all the stars - especially from Dean Winters, who learns how to pull his character out of his own personal hell a little bit more after every case with Milt.",1460851200,6,1032,4.380208333333333
