7973191,5,B00006RJ55,"I have seen many of Goodtimes' outputs of Golden Films and Jetlag productions and despite their lower quality of animation, there's very few I haven't enjoyed.  Heidi was released directly to video in 1996 and was produced by Jetlag Productions, released on DVD for the first time in 2002 by GoodTimes Home Entertainment.  A lot of viewers make the mistake of comparing these children's productions to those of the Walt Disney studios, which is something I avoid, instead, I view these films and judge them by their own merit.  They are colorful, charming and often feature a number of soft, sweet songs.  They're also rather simple, which is part of their charm since they tell the story directly instead of taking too many twists or out-of-place sequences like some Disney films sometimes do.

Heidi (1996) was inspired by Johanna Spyri's charming, classic novel of the same name.  It is the second animated adaptation I've seen of Spyri's novel, the other one was the 1974 Japanese 52-episode World Masterpiece Theater series, which was hugely popular in Spain but never saw a United States airing.  Jetlag Productions' film tells the familiar story of the little orphaned girl named Heidi who lives with her aunt Dete until the age of five.  Then her aunt finds a job with a wealthy family and in order to free herself from Heidi, leaves the girl up in the Swiss Alps with her grumpy grandfather.  At first, the old man isn't happy with the new arrangement, he agrees to take in the girl, but angrily sends Dete away.  The grandfather is moved by the girl's charming ways and offers her a comfortable bed in the room of her choice.  Heidi loves her new home in the mountains, she loves the fresh air, the green grass and especially the goats.  She meets a boy a little older than her named Peter, he and his grandmother live alone in a small cabin that is falling apart.  The poor woman is blind and Heidi quickly feels sorry for her; she offers her ""kind words"" and asks her grandfather to help them.  Sadly, just when Heidi has fully adapted to her new, happy life, Aunt Dete returns and takes Heidi away to the city of Frankfurt in Germany, where she'll be the companion of a little girl.  Heidi arrives at the home of the Sasemann family, where she meets Clara, a little girl in a wheelchair; unable to walk and leave her home.  The two girls quickly become great friends and this friendship allows Clara to see that Heidi is homesick and wishes to see the mountains and her grandfather again.  Heidi is again full of happiness when she's allowed to return to the mountains and knows that Clara and her grandmother will be paying them a visit there.

This is one of the sweetest outcomes from Jetlag Productions (which are usually not as charming as the Golden Films), the animation is not Disney by any means, but it's nicely done and the characters are well-drawn and detailed.  The film features three beautiful songs that really add a special mood to the movie; ""Start with a Smile"", ""This is Home"" and ""The Very Best of Friends"".  I would definitely recommend this animated treasure to anyone searching for a nicely done animated version of the classic tale or simply, to anyone looking for a pleasant 49-minute, child-friendly film who is open-minded enough to not let inferior animation bother him.  Highly recommended!",1174521600,11,3334,4.723661485319516
7973192,3,B00006RJ55,"Nicely-done animated version of HEIDI, based on the novel by Johanna Spyri.  Young Heidi is sent to live with her gruff grandfather in the Alps.  Her kind nature soon endears her to the mountainfolk as well as her grandfather, and their lives are very happy, until Heidi is taken away to Frankfurt, as a companion for the lame Klara.

Although this version comes from the series of Goodtimes animated classics (which aren't exactly masterpieces of animation), the quality of the animation in HEIDI is quite lush and the characters are drawn in the Japanese Anime style.  The heart and humanity of Spyri's story comes across very well, and adults (as well as children) will find themselves happily caught up in Heidi's world.  Highly-recommended.",1154736000,7,745,5.024390243902439
