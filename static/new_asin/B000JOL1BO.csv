8152599,5,B000JOL1BO,Excellent and presented in layman's terms so even any devout atheist can understand it. It was shocking to find out that these things are still being presented in science books both on a high school and college level. Aren't young people PAYING for an education? Looks like New World Order indoctrination to me to still be holding on falsehoods.,1519516800,,345,4.864406779661017
8152600,1,B000JOL1BO,"Hovind is a demonstrated fraud. The only people who believe his ideas are remotely acccurate are people who do not cross check his claims. For example, Hovind is a fan of attempting to inject the biblical concept of ""kind"" while debating evolution. You might as well argue the NY Giants are a piss poor team because they have no homeruns or the Rangers suck because they have no field goals.",1499904000,,391,4.6
8152601,5,B000JOL1BO,Very true and informative. So grateful for men who tell the truth,1485475200,,65,4.5
8152602,1,B000JOL1BO,This is a book filled with lies and misrepresentations. It is nothing but anti-science being pushed on a gullible group of people so that a huckster can line his pockets.,1471478400,,170,4.7
8152603,5,B000JOL1BO,"I loved this. There's so much good information. Be careful for false review such as ""A fan"" He's obviously and evolutionist who keeps posting the same lies and two star rating on all of Dr. Hovinds products. It just shows what kind of people the evolution theory makes people to be. I guess it's ok to lie though since there's no God huh...? What a joke.. I loved Dr. Hovinds products and I know you will too.",1459728000,,409,4.324675324675325
8152604,5,B000JOL1BO,I had a partial recording of this presentation and am so glad to get the whole presentation.,1419033600,,92,4.470588235294118
8152605,5,B000JOL1BO,I bought this whole series and found them to be a radical life and mind changer!!!,1410825600,,82,4.1875
