8431384,5,B004IZ6E0I,"Just great drama.

From the heart-busting theme tune on, you are in for a treat,  The lives and tribulations of a women's footie team up in the North of England is played out here.  Names that went on to great things act their socks off - James Nesbiit, Lesley Sharp, Marsha Thomason, John Thompson....90s TV at its best.

Really - if you want an involving, engrossing story with no super-model types but people who look like real people, give this a go.  It's not afraid to make some of the women infuriating and frumpy.  It's not afraid of lesbianism (de rigeur now, but not then).  It's not afraid of unglamorous lives.  But it's written with such joy and humour and heart, you root for the team, the women, the men, the whole damn lot of them.",1415232000,,747,4.4411764705882355
8431385,5,B004IZ6E0I,I've always loved this series ever since I first saw it 10 or more years ago.  What a shame it only lasted 5 seasons and season 5 isn't yet available on DVD.  It would have been great if the series had kept going.,1376956800,,213,3.9302325581395348
