7453299,5,B015XC8DJO,"This was very well written, David was a loving and good husband who made a mistake.  He didn't consciously go on the hunt for a woman...but when he received the news about his job... He should have called home, or got on the next flight home. Amy was there but she wasn't the answer...but he would not have discovered the necessity of faith, had he not gone down this path...people can't take their loved ones for granted.",1454803200,3,422,4.48051948051948

7453301,3,B015XC8DJO,"Thank you Falco Ink for sending us this DVD to review!

David Lyfe had a good life, a nice house, a great job, a pretty wife and daughter, and a baby on the way.  He was a wonderful dad and a loving husband.  Things couldn't get much better until he found out that his company was merging with another bank.  He detested having to fly out to California to lay off the people he personally hand-picked for that location.  To make matters worse, once that was handled, he was given the same lay-off spiel by his boss! To cope with the news David decided to drown away his sorrows at the hotel bar.

Its there that he meets a lonely housewife named Amy and they share stories about each others life and spouses.  David is happy in his marriage, but Amy is not since her husband doesnt pay much attention to her and her desire to have kids.  Id like to say that they parted ways but instead David makes a mistake that will cost him his family, house, and job opportunities.

When David hits rock bottom, he meets up with a pastor and starts to stay at their homeless shelter.  The pastors daughter took an interest in David since she sensed her deceased mothers presence around him and knew that he deserved a second chance.  Can David repent of his sins and regain his wifes trust and earn her forgiveness?  Youll have to watch this eighty-two-minute film that has earned Dove awards for yourself.  Its recommended for audiences that are twelve and older and I agree with that rating.  Although intimacy is not shown, it is implied and there are alcohol references.

Overall I found the movie enjoyable, but predictable.  The acting is decent and the main character is a good guy who makes one mistake and pays dearly for it.  The wife is rightfully hurt and her mother (who was cheated on numerous times) is pushing for her to divorce him.  As a Christian I like the message of redemption, but Im not so fond of the spiritual sensing that the pastors daughter had with the local homeless residents.",1454198400,3,1996,4.481994459833795

7453332,5,B015XC8DJO,"This movie is sad, moving and touching.  It shows the struggle a man goes through after making a bad decision.  It reminds you that life can change at the drop of a dime.  One wrong choice and your life could start to spiral out of control.  The actors and actresses in the movie are great and the main character gives a powerful performance.  I almost felt bad for the struggle he was going through.  I recommend this touching movie.",1461801600,4,434,4.430379746835443

8734872,4,B015XC8DJO,"I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice.  I don't own it yet but DVR'd it.  All the actors were excellent and his wife is simply gorgeous.  I saw her in another movie and now believe anything she plays in will not be disappointing.  Parts of the movie were not clear, I'm guessing it's left to the audience's imagination. You did feel sorry for him but after watching it a second time you'll see how he allowed himself to be set up.  Definitely for a  Christian audience or marriage group.",1510272000,,489,4.318681318681318
