Feel asleep on the sofa and watching the ending; well pleased.",1514678400,,173,4.4375
7969771,2,B00006IUHD,"I agree with another reviewer who said that the premise was totally off-base. No one can be convicted for painting under an assumed name. I didn't like the characters or the story. The art was pleasing. The main character, the unknown (to me) who played the artist, was the only believable character. It's one of those that makes me say, ""Why did I waste my time watching that?"" But don't go by my tastes, because I like older movies with a story, good actors, and some production value. I rarely see anything made in the last 15 years that I like.",1450396800,,548,4.435643564356436
7969772,4,B00006IUHD,"I found it entertaining, fresh story line, enlightening (and what I believe is accurate portrayal of the high-end art market amongst the wealthy), with a romantic element to keep the story moving interestingly.  Sure, there was some small amount of literary license taken, but most movies worth watching do so and it is to keep the production working and not dragged down by explaining how every circumstance realistically came to be.

I'd recommend!",1424390400,,450,5.1506849315068495
7969773,5,B00006IUHD,"Simply said the art speaks for itself, watch the movie and find out what the heck I mean!",1062720000,,89,4.0
7969774,4,B00006IUHD,"The premise is quite well carried off and the art even looks real, but there is one big logical flaw in the plot that bothered me. It is NOT fraud to use a ""nom de brush"" just as writers can legally use a ""nom de plume"". As long as the artist was not trying to pass off the work as an existing artist's work, there was NO law that was broken. As for embellishing the background of the artist, well just ask any Hollywood agent about that. Otherwise the story is provocative and does make you wonder...just what is being ""valued"" in a work of art..the work itself or the label, with the label being the artist's tortured bio.",1051747200,2,624,4.2521008403361344
