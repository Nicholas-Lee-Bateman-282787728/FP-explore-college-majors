8759030,5,B01EK68WCC,"For several years i've been wanting to take up some sort of senior exercise class so i don't lose my mobility but have been intimidated to do so. Being on a fixed income,  also put off by the cost of joining a club or senior exercise class. My daughter gave me ""stretching for seniors"" recently, and it's been just wonderful for my wife and me because we can do it in the comfort and privacy of our own home and on our own schedule. We do this several times each week and have noticed that we are more limber and feel more stable on our feet during the day's activities. Also less accident prone, it seems. Connie's methods are very approachable we have found, even if you are not an active person. If you're like me, 60+ and looking for a way to maintain or regain your flexibility and prevent injuries, this is a pretty affordable and painless way to do it on your own time. We are looking to buy the other movies in the series, glad to see there are several.",1470787200,21,961,4.251366120218579
