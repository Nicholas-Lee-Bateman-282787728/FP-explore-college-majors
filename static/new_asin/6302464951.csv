7826189,5,6302464951,"My husband used to love Wile E Coyote cartoons but hadn't gotten to see them for a long time so I bought this VHS collection..  The cartoons are drawn very well (they are the early ones) and each cartoon seems to have a never ending quantity of trials and failures to get that Road Runner.  I thought I had seen them all over the years but this was great to see all of VERY IMAGINATIVE ways that Wile E tries to catch the Road Runner and fails.

The tape runs 33 min., Cartoons include: WHOA, BE GONE, GUIDED MUSCLE, RABBIT'S FEAT [includes Wile E. Coyote with Bugs Bunny instead of the Road Runner], STOP! LOOK! AND HASTEN! [is the first great Road Runner cartoon] and HOPALONG CASUALTY.

c 1992 Program compilation and artwork, names, characters, etc. c 1992 Warner Bros Inc. but the cartoons are from years before.  Also try The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie.",1365120000,,861,4.493589743589744
