6262749,5,B00IF8PTVO,"Thoroughly entertaining throughout, worth a watch. Wouldn't buy it just rent. But overall worth watching at least once on a cozy night in when there is nothing to watch on tv.",1399939200,8,175,4.67741935483871
6262750,1,B00IF8PTVO,"Horrible writing
Horrible acting
Horrible effects
Low budget.......like a cheap stage production with cheap effects.  Lacking the Batman and Robin ""POW"" and ""ZAP"" which would have improved this excuse for a movie.  I want my $4.00 bucks back!",1399939200,,242,5.342105263157895
6262751,1,B00IF8PTVO,"The highlight (only light really) of this movie was the great evil swagger of the prince. Loved that. Everyone else should have camped it up too, it might have been funnier. As it was, this was clunky, boring and really not worth watching, except for the scenes with the prince, those were great!",1398211200,4,296,4.60377358490566
6262752,2,B00IF8PTVO,"Location - nice. Story line - bad. Acting - not great. Special effects - not great. Pretty much just a violent re-telling of the classic fairy tale that occasionally went a little haywire with some kooky, gory special effects. (head ripped off - complete with spine and zombies - who eat their hearts out and some CG creatures that were...well, bad) Sadly, it looked like they were hoping for a sequel, but the first one is bad enough. Not the very WORST film I have ever seen, but this will make my top 20. Not for really young kids - more a guy's take on the old story and some very slow pacing. Sleeping beauty had the best idea - take a siesta instead.",1397865600,4,656,4.298387096774194
6262773,1,B00IF8PTVO,this was the worse movie I have ever watched. Please don't waste your time watching this as I did.  Not worth watching. Id rather watch the cooking channel if I had known.  It was a no star from me but had to give a 1 star to leave a review.,1511049600,,241,3.8

It's laughable.
Some outfits are cute.
You can skip since it's online on Amazon.
The cover of the film is pretty good. Like the pic.
It is still the classical sleeping beauty.

Anyone can watch this. The acting is... bleh. Ok I guess. Some characters are dummmmmmb. A movie to watch that's funny or you've nothing else to watch.",1505174400,,352,4.484375

6262779,1,B00IF8PTVO,"I feel sorry for the actors who were duped into making this film! True, their acting wasn't great, but they didn't have much of a script to work with either.

6262780,3,B00IF8PTVO,"okay listen, this movie makes my life, its awful, poorly funded, most of the script is entirely prose, the actors that are supposed to be around the same age totally don't look it, and sweet mother of pearl the special effects are... well I'll just say it definitely could have used better funding and budgeting. BUT. With all of these flaws I honestly recommend this movie to my friends since I have discovered an amazing drinking game to play along with it. It's called drink whenever theres a continuity error. Like a wire in the shot, or a microphone, or someone that suddenly somehow becomes a prince, the list goes on. This should by no means deter you from watching this movie, it's an excellent example of an indie film that really did okay in the dark fairytale genre. I just think that budgeting and maybe a little change up with casting and script would have made it just a bit better.",1504051200,,896,4.537037037037037

6262796,1,B00IF8PTVO,"Started out somewhat interesting and palatable. But in the castle it went from OK to really bad. Like the only thing the director was trying to accomplish was violence and gore and how much blood and shock affect. Pathetic retelling of an imaginative story. If you want a cheesy horror film, this would be like a cheesecake gone bad.",1495670400,,333,4.661016949152542
6262797,1,B00IF8PTVO,"It's an interpretation of Sleeping Beauty.

Some nice landscape shots of Bulgaria and other Bulgarian stuff,  some over-dramatized acting, anachronistic dialog and cheesy CGI.  On the plus side, the Bad Prince Jayson ( Edward French ) did a great job of acting, in spite of a less than great script - I really didn't like his character.  Dawn ( Grace Van Dien ), as a character had potential, but was rather one dimensional and nothing much came of her - the most character development was by Gruner ( Gil Kolirin ) who also did a good job of being a bad guy slowly turning good.

For a low budget movie, I did find it entertaining, and never had the urge to just stop watching.

If you view this with an open mind and have no preconceptions from the movie's name, you probably will find it enjoying and get a few laughs.
Not every movie needs to have a 5 start rating to be enjoyable!",1491436800,3,885,4.365853658536586
6262798,2,B00IF8PTVO,"Good thing it's free for Prime subscribers. I would have regretted paying a $3.99 rental fee, and I certainly won't be buying it.

On the other hand, ""Sleeping Beauty"" was not entirely uninteresting, but much of the dialog and most of the acting was horrible. Obviously low-budget, but cheap special effects ... and zombies?! Not a movie for children.",1490313600,,351,4.9491525423728815

Or more correctly, a bunch of high school boys?  It's a horrible twist on an innocent fairy tale, but the gratuitous skin and sexual innuendo, couple with totally unnecessary graphic gore, was absolutely insulting.  The movie is an insult to adult intelligence and completely inappropriate for children - but I imagine some teenage boys might be amused and pleased.",1485302400,,518,4.648351648351649

It is obviously a low budget film, but personally, as low budget gets it's quite good...I think it's a different story line on the Sleeping Beauty we all know...but since Maleficent came out in theaters, it gives us an idea that not all fairy tales are meant to stay the same. The sweet Sleeping Beauty we all know is great for children, but reality is...during the times of Kings, Queens, and Knights it probably was a more vicious life.

The prince was highly egoistic, overbearing and a spoiled brat. His friends weren't not much better. The princess was pretty naive (I make the excuse of being too sheltered and locked up all her life).

I picked up because looking at the back I noticed there were zombies in it, and only about a month or so ago I saw Pride Prejudice and Zombies and thought it was pretty good.  Sleeping Beauty is no where as professionally made, well written or had the budget of that movie though.  With the good fairies and the opening when everyone is still awake scenes, it looked like a Saturday morning kids show aimed film.  When we then go 100 years into the future (the present) we meet the main villain of the film a spoilt rich kid type prince who literally has a whipping boy.  Another teen/early twenties guy who gets whipped for every indiscretion the prince should be being punished for.  Again the fact this looks like a kids' movie is reinforced with these scenes with the guy getting whipped really hard which would have left permanent injuries and would have taken a long time to recover, just moving normally afterwards where he finds a letter the princess gave to a dove when he raids a doves nest.  Obviously it never rained in this place for 100 years, and doves just take over the nest of ones who are deceased.  Speaking of absurd things for the plot to work, the prince has never heard of this Kingdom, a short walk from the castle he lives in, but now wants to claim it for his own.

Most of the moat creatures, gargoyle/dragon things whatever they were supposed to be, looked pretty cool but obvious CGI.  The zombies were pretty lame, both looking and behaviour wise, and were really just like people with no weapon or fighting skills, easily pushed away with the lifting of a leg during fighting. There was a cool rip the head of a guy with his spine hanging and dripping blood which probably wouldn't fit into the little kids market the rest of the film mostly is.  There's also a scene where two guys in the raiding party put a sleeping girl (the whole kingdom not just Sleeping Beauty is in a deep sleep) on a table, pulled down her pants and would have had their way with her if the prince hadn't told them there was no time for that, get his treasure first then they could have their pick of the girls, which certainly isn't something a film aimed at kids would include.  The film didn't need to be aimed at kids, make the whipping more realistic, bring the same head ripped off gruesomeness to other battles with creatures and the film would have been way, way better for adults.

The acting is a bit off, and it's only when you watch the extras that you learn that this is not only the director's debut film, but he cast himself as the king, his wife as the queen and his daughter as their daughter (sleeping beauty).  I think every parent sees their kid as the best at whatever they do and there was a bit of rose coloured glasses on the entire family's acting performance.  You've also got your usual odd fairy tale stuff like why if the evil witch hates the princess, does she put her in a luxurious soft bed for 100 years.  How do all these asleep people not starve to death while asleep and other stuff like this.

Saying all that, the film is still watchable, if you ever come across it for free on TV or whatever, it still will amicably pass the 89 minutes.",1470441600,,3252,4.3754152823920265

There is also a scholar and the whipping boy, who also is a Prince, but a captured one, who in a group of six set out to wake the sleeping beauty and gain a kingdom.
I didn't care for all the zombies the evil fairy kept waking and creating. It got old quickly.

However the script and the dialog were often inane and the switching speech from 20th century American to British to pseudo-Renaissance to poetry and back was annoying.  Most of the characters were uninteresting and it was hard to ""like"" them or care whether they lived or hopefully died quickly so the story would be over.  There were also a number of dues machina incidents and other What the F...? events.  Most of the actors were amateurish and some quite horrible.

6263184,3,B00IF8PTVO,"I was, VERY MUCH, reminded of the 1980's version of ""The Clash of the Titans"", in Special Effects, Acting AND Storyline.  Not all, but most of the acting was awful, which is always possible to eek past if the writing is any good and the writing wasn't all bad... inconsistent, but not all bad.  The special effects were somewhat sophomoric... again... a pass may be given in that I really loved the 80's version of The Clash of the Titans in spite of it. I told myself it was a little retro in that respect and rather an accidental, if not deliberate homage to Harryhausen.  Whether or not it was didn't matter, in that is what I told myself throughout the movie and without that thought to cajole me along, I think I would have liked it much less.  The zombies... were the worst of the bunch right after royal mama and papa's acting.  Again, I made allowances as ... well... zombies are vacant so... why shouldn't their acting be as well?  There is quite a bit of violence.  And, often, very graphic, I wouldn't recommend it for young children.  Aside from some of the 'acting', the directing seemed to be this movie's biggest problem.  Some scenes were very choppy.  Sadly, parts which would have been key to the story must have lay waste on the cutting room floor.  There was often confusion during key dialogue.  Someone would be talking but you never knew who was saying what as the camera was hardly ever on the person talking, during the castle siege.  The story was certainly an interesting take on the classic. I find the introduction of zombies to be a new one on me... but current with this generation's trend toward fixation on them... so I get it.  I did find it a bit lacking in the 'making sense' department.  Certain things the baddie was capable of, in the end, could have... easily, been used as a means to an evil end all along... Think 'Dorothy's Ruby Slippers'... but I guess the writers missed that glaring ""oops"" and opted to create a whole lot of unnecessary fight scenes in spite of it.

*SPOILER ALERT*... If she could order the 'undead' to kill Dawn for her... Why didn't she just do that 100 years ago?  Did it really take 100 years and this particular group of adventurers to inspire her to come up with that solution?  And if she was capable of seeing everything in her castle... how was she not able to see young Newt?  And if she could conjure one dragon, why not 2? or 200?  6 guys wouldn't be able to get past that many at once or live to tell any tales about them either.  Still... as the story goes, without these inconsistencies there would be no story so... Take a gulp and pretend it doesn't matter... after all... it IS fiction.  It isn't a bad movie, I didn't hate it.  It isn't really a good one, I didn't love it, but it IS mildly entertaining and a nice little jaunt from reality.. I liked it.  It was certainly an original take on an old tale.  Watching it once won't hurt.  And much of the scenery is just stunning.  A beautiful backdrop for a mediocre movie.

But while some actors were good, the writing [or maybe improvisation? or direction?] got pretty hokey, with anachronisms galore, like *okay* and *headsup*. Why bother to have superb scenery, GREAT costumes accurate to 400-500 years ago, and classic British accents, if you're dumping modern speech into it? All that scenery, costumes, and setting are extremely costly to create a believable illusion. Too bad -- too many betrayals of setting, and story here. Result? unintentional parody.

I found the acting to be only okay to bleh. The special effects were decent enough, and the landscape shots were beautiful. Changing Aurora's name to Dawn in this picture did nothing to take away - this story was a rewrite of the classic Sleeping Beauty; unfortunately, the dialogue was fairly stagnant and barely moved the plot forward, let alone added anything to it. The dragon was pretty cool looking. The ignorant, lazy, mean Prince was nothing more than a two dimensional character; the whipping boy was little better, but at least barely managed to portray a three dimensional character.

But that's only the beginning of this tale.  It then picks up after many years have passed and the story of the cursed kingdom has become a legend and most of the world doesn't even remember where the kingdom was.

I like them because they are a fantasy story;  not so much blood and guts with eight tons of profanity.  Too many movies these days are so gruesome it's pathetic.  Do yourself a favor and watch a fairy tale movie.  It will take you out of the norm for a couple of hours.,1457568000,2,414,3.9878048780487805

6263366,2,B00IF8PTVO,"To be fair, if this was a project by a first time film student, then well done.  For someone more seasoned, it definitely needs work.  I get the feel someone rented a helicopter to shoot some scenery, borrowed some clothes from the anachronistic society, and perhaps even made some of the work in an Olive Garden parking lot with angles to make one think it was an old setting.  I get it, it had a low production budget, so one had to make due.
  But looking past that, I see that the film attempted to use Finn Jones (Game of Thrones) as its green light.  Well played; people will certainly identify him in such a role.  However, his fate like many of the other actors in the script has conflicting dialogue.  ""We can't do this...let's do it anyway"".  Obviously, it wasn't a very thick plot noting it dotes on the classical story, but again, it simply isn't well produced.  Noting the focus that was given to Finn's character, it should have spent a bit more on character development to make one want to identify with him as the protagonist.  If not for the guessed intention of using Jones noting his notoriety in Game of Thrones, one would be spending time guessing who the hero was, except that his character borrows a bit from Cinderella in that he has a good heart and takes a beating.
  It's a challenge to make a film of this undertaking with a reduced budget.  There are probably corners that could have been cut to make it more efficient such as removing the filming of the mountains, the CGI swamp thing, and such to spend the production in other areas, but as it is, it appears to be a novice creation.  Granted, it attempted to make its spin using ghouls, lizard/dragon creatures, and fairies taking one for the team in revenge.  However, these somewhat original takes on the story was not enough to safe the film.",1457308800,,1827,4.490909090909091

6263430,3,B00IF8PTVO,"This movie was definitely a mixed bag with lots of potential.  It wasn't bad at all, but a bit more polishing would have helped a great deal.  One thing many of these low budget films lack is time--they usually have to knock them out as quickly as possible, and that's where many of the problems come from with these films.  They don't have time to do rewrites and re-shoot scenes (the monster make-up could have used a boost and more originality in this shoot).  And it's too bad--this film really had something--they made an obvious effort to give the characters a backstory and depth--which I greatly appreciated, and something usually not seen in low budget films.  Unfortunately the pacing was a bit uneven and sometimes continuity in characterizations didn't fit--like ""wait a minute--shouldn't that be something that other character would have said? Not him?""  The acting was also mixed--but the main players were fine. Overall, I really enjoyed how this well-known fairy tale was altered to offer something unexpected-- most of the changes worked very nicely and added a great deal to the story, greatly reviving and updating the tale.  Let's just say, this evil fairy does not get away clean while the castle slumbers!  Overall the story is enjoyable and the low-key humor (this is not a comedy), while involving subtle innuendo in some cases, was not juvenile or offensive (no fart jokes) and I wouldn't hesitate to allow even 'tweens to view this film.  There's sword-fighting and head-chopping but nothing overtly gory and doesn't even have any overt sex scenes Yes, it's a bit of a mish-mash overall, but for something different and a Saturday afternoon's entertainment, it's a fun break and a truly fresh view on the old Sleeping Beauty fairy tale.",1455926400,,1762,4.945762711864407

6263455,3,B00IF8PTVO,"Whenever the Asylum adapts a public-domain movie, they manage to horribly mishandle it. ""Snow White,"" ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""Moby Dick,"" anything involving Sherlock Holmes -- even though all these could be adapted decently for little money, they invariably manage to screw it up.

So I was not expecting good things from their adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" which was churned out just in time to take advantage of the Disney movie ""Maleficent."" And at first, it seemed to be the same ol' awful Asylum, with cheesy dialogue and rushed wooden acting... but when the story's focus shifts to the rescuing hero, it actually becomes a fairly interesting story, with the usual CGI Asylum monsters actually put to good use. It's not a good story, but it's also not a bad one.

When King David (Casper Van Dien) and Queen Violet (real-life wife Catherine Oxenberg) present their baby daughter Dawn to the kingdom, a bunch of fairies give her magical gifts and virtues. Of course, the evil Queen Tambria (Olivia d'Abo) appears and curses the baby to prick her finger on a spindle and die, and the other fairies soften it to ""eternal sleep until kissed."" You can probably guess how it goes: as a teenager, Dawn (Grace Van Dien) is tricked into poking her finger with a spindle, and the whole kingdom falls into an unbreakable sleep.

To this point, ""Sleeping Beauty"" has been... mesmerizingly bad. The dialogue is cheesy (""You have killed my sister. Now you'll pay for your betrayal""), the acting is indifferent, and Grace Van Dien... well, this was her very first role as a named character, and it shows. She rushes through every line, sugary and yet wooden.

But thankfully, then the story shifts forward a hundred years, and instead focuses on Barrow (Finn Jones), the whipping boy to the cruel, spoiled Prince Jayson (Edward Lewis French). When Barrow finds a convenient map to the legendary sleeping kingdom, Jayson confiscates it so he can kiss the princess and get her kingdom. Barrow is forced to follow Jayson and his warrior buddies, since he is the only one who is literate and thus can actually read the thing. Of course, Tambria is still hanging around the place, and she decides to unleash some massive trouble on the little band of adventurers -- primarily a vicious moat monster and a band of murderous zombies.

One of the biggest problems with the Asylum's fairy tale adaptations is... well, the Asylum likes to take thematically-complete stories and add giant monsters, robots and other weird things to it. ""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of the few instances where this works, since the whole concept is that an evil fairy -- or witch, it's not clear -- is summoning creatures to keep anyone from kissing the princess. So while there are zombies and a poorly-CGI-ed water monster, they don't feel out of place in the story.

Similarly, ""Sleeping Beauty"" feels like it was written by a clever but inexperienced screenwriter, one who has good ideas but still needs to work on the technical aspects. While the story starts with all the tropes (evil fairy, good fairies, curse, prince), it comes up with some clever inversions and subversions -- the villain uses her magic to trick everyone in a rather clever way, and the hero is a whipping boy for a conceited, cruel prince. However, the backstory aspects of the story are horribly clumsy -- Tambria's backstory is only half sketched-out, while Barrow's is shoved into the final act rather than being used in his relationship with Jayson and his followers.

And while ""Sleeping Beauty"" has the same woefully small cast as most Asylum films (David and Violet seemingly rule about twenty people), it does have a pretty decent setting. The palace where most of the action takes place is spacious enough to allow some zombie chases and creeping about, even if Jayson's kingdom seems to be one abandoned building and a field by the river.

As for the acting... well, Van Dien and Oxenberg (who both look a decade too old for their roles) both give woodenly indifferent performances, and their daughter Grace is embarrassingly bad. She rushes through every single line she's given, with the breathless affectations of a living doll. But Jones -- yes, Loras Tyrell is in this movie -- is actually quite good as a smart, kind-hearted guy who even tries to save the prince who has been tormenting him for years, and French gives a decent enough performance as a prince who undergoes some semi-plausible development into a half-decent person. As for d'Abo, her barely-restrained air of contempt oddly suits a sorceress who is constantly thwarted and frustrated.

""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of the better movies by the Asylum.... which is to say, its low budget and uneven cast make it unintentionally comical at times, but it shows enough thought and writing ability to at least be interesting.",1447804800,,4833,4.891330891330892

6263457,2,B00IF8PTVO,"I really wanted to like this movie but was turned off by a few major elements.  Foremost in my criticism is the fact that the DVD box cover prominently displays a fire-breathing dragon - sort of a hall-mark/highlight of both the Disney animated version of 'Sleeping Beauty' and the more recent ""Malificent"" re-imagining of the classic tale. BUT - there is NO DRAGON in this Asylum version - despite it's major presence on the box cover!  There are a couple of pretty good  CGI creatures: a sea serpent in the moat, and a gargoyl-ish critter that pops up a few times to menace the hero(s) - but that's it.  The rest of the film is plagued by generally limp performances and such 'by-the-numbers' action that it's a chore to stay awake through it.  The producers managed to find a nice castle in Bulgaria to cut down on their production costs but it looks a little too much like a tourist attraction and doesn't provide much real gritty ambiance as the group of squabbling royals go thru the paces of waking up the sleeping princess. Over-all the production values aren't too bad - but not really much else to recommend the effort.

6263465,5,B00IF8PTVO,"This version of Sleeping Beauty has a lot going for it. The castle where it is filmed in hauntingly beautiful and interesting. Other scenes are also nicely filmed. The music background is very good. The plot is straight forward. The new baby is cursed, the fairies put a protective spell on the baby, then 16 years later the princess pricks her finger on a spindle, she and the kingdom fall into a slumber, and the wicked witch rules, ect.... There are some fun twists. The princess writes letters before she is cursed and birds carry them off. One hundred years later those notes are found by a wiping boy who then is part of a band of adventurers who go to the castle. The acting is pretty good. Grace Van Dien is great as the princess. Maya Van Dien plays a young girl who survives inside the cursed castle (reminded me of Newt from the Alien series). The Newt character was especially well acted and very interesting. Michael York as the narrator was a nice touch. Casper Van Dein's role is smaller than I expected. The only real downside I saw was the handheld camera filming for some of the fight scenes. I personally dislike handheld filming styles, but here it was only used rarely and therefore did not ruin the whole movie. Overall a solid and fun action adventure movie. A- rating from me.",1409961600,9,1300,4.536170212765957

6263469,5,B00IF8PTVO,"I think my title says it all. No sense giving too much away. Asylum manages to capitalize on the zombie craze from Abraham Lincoln to Sleeping Beauty. After all, its all about the green. No sense wasting money on James Earl Jones, for an announcer when Michael York needs the work. Having Casper Van Dien and his family direct and star in the film was some more Asylum genius as no one has mastered the faux-Elizabeathan accent like them.  Sleeping Beauty was named ""Dawn."" Again, how clever is that, especially when Casper Van Dien is made up to look like Tony Orlando.

Then there is the almost Monty-Pythonesque language:

Prince: ""What is that?""
Aide ""The undead my liege.""
Prince ""Run!""

Asylum has really outdone themselves with this mockbuster.

This is 5 star Asylum material. For serious viewers, you should avoid this film.

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Near sex with a sleeping person. Killing and blood squirts. Heads being whacked off.

6263473,5,B00IF8PTVO,"Casper Van Dien's directorial debut is a triumph on all fronts. The Asylum has had a fair bit of success with retelling fairy tales in various ways- somewhat modernized (Jack The Giant Killer; pretty damn great) to full on horror (Hansel & Gretel; creepy as hell). This is probably their most faithful adaptation, and without a doubt their best film to date.

Boasting the greatest score of their filmography, this movie starts perfectly. The slighted fairy Tambria curses Princess Dawn, and then fights three good fairies! She promptly kills them. That is how this movie opens! It's impressive and immediately grabs your attention. Thanks to solid directing, beautiful cinematography, and tight editing it thankfully never lets go.

The bulk of the story takes place 100 years after Dawn succumbs to her curse, and involves a prince and his men trekking to the magical kingdom to save her from Tambria. This involves them fighting wyrms, zombies, booby traps, mind control spells, a sea monster, and themselves. It all works within the story surprisingly well, and the movie isn't afraid to go dark.

The costumes are excellent and don't look like costumes, but actual period wear. The location shoot provides a great deal of production value, especially the castle. The stained glass windows are beautiful.

This was a family affair as Van Dien not only directed but stars as the King, his real life wife the Queen, and eldest daughter Grace plays the titular beauty! His other children also have brief roles. Grace acquits herself amazingly, and is easy to buy as a headstrong but scared princess. Granted, she's sleeping through a large section. When she's awake though, she exudes natural charisma.

Olivia D'Abo is the evil fairy Queen Tambria and makes for a wonderful villain. Shamelessly evil (thank goodness) she wields a badass attitude and is quite threatening (""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" take notes! This is how an interesting villain is handled!). Finn Jones as Barrow, the whipping boy is excellent. His frustrations at his place in life is shown, but just below the surface, adding some nice layers. Edward Lewis French as stuck up, selfish Prince Jayson plays the cocksure bad boy to the hilt, but restrains himself before it becomes grating! Add on a nice twist reveal of his character's true motivation and you end up with a truly engaging ensemble of actors all playing complex and interesting characters.

Composer Joseph Metcalfe, who has worked on other Asylum productions (and the awesome JCVD vehicle ""Hard Corps""), outdoes himself, and wider, more mainstream released films with his score for this. Ephemeral, eerie, graceful, sweet, and everything else when needed, I can't recall a greater score to an Asylum film, nor one that is utilized so perfectly with the onscreen action.

Having received it a few days after it's release, I was very excited once it arrived. I happened to have seen the two worst films of the year (so far) just days before turning this on. This low budget retelling of a classic fairy tale blows "" Godzilla (2014)"" & ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" so high out of the water it's remarkable! In a year in which the Asylum had already released some their most ambitious and well made productions to date (""Android Cop"" & ""Mega Shark Vs. Mecha Shark"" are excellent) this is their best, by large and far. Real care and effort were extended to every end of the film, and it shows. Absolutely one of the best films of the year!",1400803200,6,3465,4.933104631217839
6263474,3,B00IF8PTVO,"Usually I cringe at a film released by Asylum, but found this a notch above their standard releases of poor directing and bad editing.  Quite a family affair film for Casper Van Dien's directing debut.  Casper, his wife Catherine Oxenberg, along with daughters Grace, Maya and Celeste Van Dien appeared in the film.  While some actors appeared stiff there were a few that stood out doing a decent job like Finn Jones, the hero, Gil Kolirin, the strong right hand and Edward French who really seemed to enjoy his role as the bad boy prince.  Grace Van Dien also did a good job as the Sleeping Beauty.  For a low budget film it faired better than expected.",1400716800,19,654,4.555555555555555

8641789,4,B00IF8PTVO,"The tag line on the cover: Blood will run for a single kiss tells you straight away that this fairy tale is done in a more traditional sense. If that isn't your cup of tea, then move on. Traditional as in pre-Disney, sugar coated versions of common fairytale stories.

Yes there are what we now consider horror elements to this tale:  gruesome deaths, dead minions, monsters... etc. have you ever read original Cinderella where the sisters cut off bits of their foot to fit into the shoe? Traditional tales include some sort of gore. The Brothers Grimm collected grim tales indeed.

It views like a lower budget independent film with some computer graphics. So the dialogue may leave you wanting, and the acting may not be up to the level you're used to. But I think its the type of dialogue they were trying to do... maybe they were trying to be authentic and missed the mark. But after I stopped mentally comparing it to other flicks...and let it stand on its own... I rather started to enjoy it.

Its sleeping beauty. The story mostly falls on a neighboring kingdoms prince, his whipping boy, & the princes men as they travel to the legendary kingdom fighting the various evil minions, to defeat the wicked witch and awaken the Princess, Dawn.

Not bad. Not sure how many times ill Watch it, but I think it tried, and I applaud and appreciate the non saccharin story for a change.",1532649600,,1383,4.582995951417004

8641797,4,B00IF8PTVO,"I like to give lesser obvious films a chance. There are recognizable actors in this story of sleeping beauty, some veteran ones like Caspar Van Dien, Olivia D'abo, which increases its credit along with the supporting actors. Maybe not a huge budget but the location, sets, effects and British accents elevate it to a better film that is worth watching. The girl who plays Sleeping Beauty is an attractive cross between a younger Hillary Duff and Taylor Swift. She isn't seen that much because she's been cursed by the witch and is now asleep. The actor from the Iron Fist series plays a whipping boy and in one scene the prince has him whipped and in another briefer one, one of the princes guys come across a knocked out witch who he attempts to have sex with until he's stopped; strange in the story line but I guess the aristocracy in those days did things like that because they could. Also have to keep in mind this is a more modern remake. A scene in which a bunch of diseased undead weirdos sent by the queen witch chases the prince and his guys through the landscape garden walls and up to the castle. The running and fighting scenes camera angles are so tight it lacked sufficient impact big time. Had they widened the shots location it could have been better.",1512691200,,1269,4.521739130434782
