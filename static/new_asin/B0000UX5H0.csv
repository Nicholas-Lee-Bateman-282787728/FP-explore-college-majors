1947588,4,B0000UX5H0,All in all a good movie....we need more places like Hope Ranch today.  Lot of good actors in this movie.,1366243200,,104,4.2
1947589,5,B0000UX5H0,"Wonderful film, About how love concurs the most hardened of hearts. A dream I have had since childhood about doing. I think I would want my child to go to a place like this if he gets into trouble. Highly recommend.",1363910400,,215,4.2682926829268295
1947590,4,B0000UX5H0,"I don't usually like low budget TV features, but this one turned out to have a great moral center. Bruce Boxleitner shines, as does the wonderful Gail O'Grady. Lamas has a good go of it too, as well as Wozniak, Pardo and other supporting cast. Great for the whole family.",1361404800,,271,4.44
1947591,5,B0000UX5H0,"This really is a decent movie...  I was suprised myself..  Lamas plays a good part and has a decent story line...

Troubled teens going to a Ranch to be rehabilitated...

Good family movie...",1258502400,,191,4.696969696969697
1947592,2,B0000UX5H0,"I am truly sorry having to give TWO STARS to a ""feel good"" movie with bad guys loosing, highly bias Judge developing a heart, horses, motorcycles and one good cleavage shot. The story is so predictable that it telegraphs everything that is going to happen.  The three bad kids are bad, but are easily controlled by an ex-con that now works at the ranch with the help of a former marine ex-cop and an old washed up cowboy. Good star lineup but even with some good acting the plot is a bit to weak.",1238544000,,496,4.276595744680851
1947593,4,B0000UX5H0,I have looked everywhere for this movie and finally found it here. I am so happy. Didn't take long to arrive. Very satisfied with this purchase.,1229385600,,144,4.576923076923077
1947594,5,B0000UX5H0,"Sometimes teens are too smart-alecky [or arrogant] to appreciate a movie that teaches right from wrong.

J. T. Hope is an ex-cop and Marine who wants to make a difference in the lives of juvenile delinquents.

He is trying to get his ranch qualified for these juvys, so wouldn't you know, the red tape brass hands him what she considers 3 tough punks who will probably make him fail.  She gives him only two weeks to show improvement in these 3 boys attitudes.

Needless to say the boys are out of their environment and have a rough time relating to horses and cattle.  Boy, did they have a lot to learn.

Lorenzo Lamas - is a young man that Hope rehabilitated and he returned to the ranch to help.  Neat tough guy!

Barry Corbin, as the old duffer used a bit of humor in teaching these tough guys the facts of life in getting along with each other.

And of couse, the one kid has a problem with his crack-head brother [whose only friends seems to be the snake].

Loved the way the boys learned to ride a horse and work the cattle.

Then we have the lady [Gail O'Grady] whose job it is to report any problems Hope has with the boys.  Brass wants a failing report.  Of course, they [her and her adopted daughter] gets tangled up with the druggies and we have a big rescue scene.

Altogether a great movie for the family to watch.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - great addition to the DVD shelf.",1118102400,16,1383,4.326848249027237
1947595,5,B0000UX5H0,One of the better family type films I've ever seen.  Bruce Boxleitner and Lorenzo Lamas take three out of control teens from the city and teach them country values.  Although I would have loved to see this movie turn into a series I think it's a definite must see.,1078963200,8,264,4.36734693877551
8003235,5,B0000UX5H0,I thought this was neat modern day oater it was filled with excitement the movie never once slowed down. It has a great story line but it has a western twist to it as well. Hope ranch is the second chance for boys caught up in today's world of gangs and young men in a mob invested world. This is one that I think the whole family will enjoy. So give this movie a chance it will steal your heart as it did mine.,1482624000,,411,3.9047619047619047

8003241,4,B0000UX5H0,"I have always like Bruce Boxleitner.  I enjoyed this movie, and was happy to see Bruce had a leading role throughout the movie.  It was nice to find a movie that didn't have swearing throughout the whole movie or someone taking off their clothes.",1402272000,,246,4.568181818181818
