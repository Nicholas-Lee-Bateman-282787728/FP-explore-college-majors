8369108,5,B002FL3IJ2,"I don't usually write reviews, but I wanted to tell others about this little known dvd.  My 2 year old loves it and I don't mind that she wants to watch it...over..and over!  She is already picking up on the colors in all the different languages, and it is pretty amazing to hear her pronounce words in other languages like it's second nature.  But, the best part of the dvd is that it's so different from the others out there.  I appreciate it's unique creativity and simplicity.  It is designed not to be over-stimulating, which I think is important to my child's development.  This also tells me that my daughter isn't just watching this dvd because it grabs her attention, but because she truly likes it.  And because she likes the dvd so much, we went online and watched some of the podcasts, which were a hit with her and I as well.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!",1253404800,,885,4.4875
