6701469,4,B00O1D3C02,"If you're crap at baking or keeping friendships, then A Cookie Cutter Christmas may be the perfect holiday movie for you. Christie Reynolds (Erin Krakow) and Penny Miller (Miranda Frigon) were childhood pals up until that infamous Christmas recital in which they, at age eight, tried to upstage each other during their duet of ""Silent Night."" Today, in Greenville, both Christie and Penny are elementary school teachers molding the minds of the young and sticking it to each other whenever they can. Walks into Christie's classroom new student Lily Thompson who lost her mom a year back. As played by Genea Charpentier, Lily is sweet and adorable. And when Christie and Penny set eyes on Lily's handsome widower dad, oboy...

Who knows, ultimately, why Christie decided to partake in the inaugural Teacher Christmas Cookie Bake-Off? It's a soup of reasons. No doubt it's to win the cash prize to afford a field trip for her class. But maybe it's also because Penny is competing. And maybe Christie wants to impress James, the widower dad (David Haydn-Jones). Except she is a horrible, horrible cook. Flies come to her kitchen to commit suicide.

Let's see how many boxes we can tick off the Hallmark Channel movie checklist. Sad widower raising a lovable child? Check. Small town of which Christmas festival is the year's most anticipated event? Check. The female lead who pines for the same true love that her parents experienced? Check. See, I like all that stuff. The Hallmark Channel is like my safety blanket. There's comfort in the warm sense of familiarity that Hallmark brings, especially come the holiday season.

Erin Krakow, striking beauty, holds the screen well. She's fun. I've enjoyed her in Chance at Romance (2013) and I look forward to Season 2 of When Calls the Heart. Krakow - a name that should've been a sound effect in the 1960's Batman television series - is steady on as a character torn between good intentions - Christie genuinely cares about Lily and her other students - and her ongoing mission to best her mortal enemy in, well, anything. I love the disgusted/put upon/mortified expressions that cross her face whenever a Penny-centric situation surfaces (my fave is the look on Christie's face when she drives over to check out Penny's much vaunted snow globe lawn decoration).

Miranda Frigon's soulless ginger is someone you love to hate, like Peg from Married with Children or Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond. I only wish the rivalry had escalated to an even more epic scale. And maybe there could've been a wee bit more chemistry between Krakow and Haydn-Jones (I blame him; he's a bit stiff). I prefer the scenes between Krakow and child actress Charpentier. I also wish that Alan Thicke - here as the food judge - had indulged in scathing Simon Cowell-like denouncements. As it is, all he does is grunt stuff and take small nibbles of the competitive cookies (probably he was concerned about having to do a ton of takes). Another quibble is that the cookies could've looked more sumptuous instead of something my aunt with the arthritis and the egg-phobia would bake.

A Cookie Cutter Christmas is appropriate for young audiences. It serves up a cute, sometimes comic holiday flick with an engaging lead actress and a cute kid who, thank goodness, isn't a brat and a string of petty oneupmanship by bitter frenemies who, by the end, are infused with the Christmas Hallmark spirit. And don't even nag about that being a spoiler. It's Hallmark, for cripes' sake. And, for me, if nothing else, I picked up some tips on how to - and how NOT to - bake cookies.",1417910400,16,3603,4.852032520325203
6701470,3,B00O1D3C02,"I collect all of the Hallmark Christmas movies, and I will probably buy this when the price comes down so it is in my collection, but I wasn't impressed.  There was virtually no chemistry between the main characters.  And, the once upon a time best friend, was soooo annoyingly rotten that I almost turned it off.  Personally, I think the best new movie of 2014 is One Starry Christmas, but it hasn't been released yet.",1417910400,3,419,4.56
6701471,5,B00O1D3C02,Loved this feel good movie! I thought it started out a little cheesy but it ended up getting really good and I have watched it over and over again!,1417910400,,147,4.103448275862069
6701472,4,B00O1D3C02,"A Hallmark Countdown to Christmas movie with lighthearted humor, some romance and lots of rivalry.

We enjoy the clean, fun, predictable Countdown movies this time of the year, and this one is no exception; although, I enjoyed ""Nine Lives of Christmas"" much more.

Here they feature Erin Krakow(""When Calls the Heart"" ) as Christie, a teacher with an ongoing, since childhood, competition with her friend Penny, Miranda Frigon(Canadian actor, singer-songwriter, martial artist?).  They compete over everything: singing, decorating, baking(thus the title) and even the handsome, widowed father, David Haydn-Jones(Somewhat typecast- who also had women fighting over him in ""Dear Santa"").

It's silly and sentimental with the focus on the women, Christie and her mom, helping the widower's daughter, and, of course, who's going to  win the bake-off and bag the man.  Ms. Krakow is good at showing her disgust and annoyance with her rival.  Alan Thicke, in more of a cameo, is glib as the food judge.

No worries: family friendly, and it all works out Hallmark style.  Merry Christmas

P.S.- I'm trying to get Amazon to offer some of these Countdown to Christmas movies at a reasonable price.  They're in the stores, but Amazon should do it directly.  It doesn't have to be as cheap as the store price but better than what's available here.  People like these movies, as we do, and will buy them.",1417651200,3,1392,5.079295154185022

The protagonist and the antagonist were two really unlikable people.  I couldn't stand either of them.

6701569,5,B00O1D3C02,Miranda Frigon does a great job as Penny in this sweet Christmas movie originally aired on the Hallmark Channel. Erin Krakow plays the other half of this childhood rivalry that has continued into adulthood. Alan Thicke is not convincing at all as the chef and judge of the cookie baking contest. Maybe if he took an actual bite of a cookie he would've come across as more credible. We will watch this movie every year.,1449878400,,418,4.586666666666667

6701572,3,B00O1D3C02,"Two ex-friends carry a grudge for twenty years.  They both become teachers, teaching in the same school, same grade, classrooms directly opposite each other..........what are the odds?  They bare ill will towards one another and try to one-up the other at every opportunity.  When a single dad shows up they both throw themselves at him.  One of the ex-friends has become an obnoxious braggart and a bully.  She is utterly ruthless and will stop at nothing to take down her opponent, including theft and trying to frame her former friend to get her disqualified from a cookie baking competition they have both entered.  At this point, their behavior is less humorous, more disconcerting.  They are teachers in a position of power, supposedly molding young minds and yet they are locked in mortal combat trying to prove one is better than the other, with this single dad as the booby-prize.  Their behavior is the type of behavior you warn kids against adopting.  There is a level of nastiness involved here that is very perplexing.  Just what was the message these filmmakers were trying to impart?  All is fair in love and war.  The end justifies the means.  After going so far towards the cliff, the hasty repair job they patch on at the end is a matter of too little too late.  Its impossible to get past what these two women were willing to do to each other in order to come out on top.  That they were once friends makes it even more bewildering.",1448582400,3,1451,4.65748031496063

6701579,5,B00O1D3C02,I really liked this movie as I like Erin Krakow.  I think she has a wonderful way of reacting when she make mistakes or is annoyed at something or somebody.,1446854400,2,156,4.2
6701580,4,B00O1D3C02,"If you're crap at baking or keeping friendships, then A Cookie Cutter Christmas may be the perfect holiday movie for you. Christie Reynolds (Erin Krakow) and Penny Miller (Miranda Frigon) were childhood pals up until that infamous Christmas recital in which they, at age eight, tried to upstage each other during their duet of ""Silent Night."" Today, in Greenville, both Christie and Penny are elementary school teachers molding the minds of the young and sticking it to each other whenever they can. Walks into Christie's classroom new student Lily Thompson who lost her mom a year back. As played by Genea Charpentier, Lily is sweet and adorable. And when Christie and Penny set eyes on Lily's handsome widower dad, oboy...

Who knows, ultimately, why Christie decided to partake in the inaugural Teacher Christmas Cookie Bake-Off? It's a soup of reasons. No doubt it's to win the cash prize to afford a field trip for her class. But maybe it's also because Penny is competing. And maybe Christie wants to impress James, the widower dad (David Haydn-Jones). Except she is a horrible, horrible cook. Flies come to her kitchen to commit suicide.

Let's see how many boxes we can tick off the Hallmark Channel movie checklist. Sad widower raising a lovable child? Check. Small town of which Christmas festival is the year's most anticipated event? Check. The female lead who pines for the same true love that her parents experienced? Check. See, I like all that stuff. The Hallmark Channel is like my safety blanket. There's comfort in the warm sense of familiarity that Hallmark brings, especially come the holiday season.

Erin Krakow, striking beauty, holds the screen well. She's fun. I've enjoyed her in Chance at Romance (2013) and I look forward to Season 2 of When Calls the Heart. Krakow - a name that should've been a sound effect in the 1960's Batman television series - is steady on as a character torn between good intentions - Christie genuinely cares about Lily and her other students - and her ongoing mission to best her mortal enemy in, well, anything. I love the disgusted/put upon/mortified expressions that cross her face whenever a Penny-centric situation surfaces (my fave is the look on Christie's face when she drives over to check out Penny's much vaunted snow globe lawn decoration).

Miranda Frigon's soulless ginger is someone you love to hate, like Peg from Married with Children or Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond. I only wish the rivalry had escalated to an even more epic scale. And maybe there could've been a wee bit more chemistry between Krakow and Haydn-Jones (I blame him; he's a bit stiff). I prefer the scenes between Krakow and child actress Charpentier. I also wish that Alan Thicke - here as the food judge - had indulged in scathing Simon Cowell-like denouncements. As it is, all he does is grunt stuff and take small nibbles of the competitive cookies (probably he was concerned about having to do a ton of takes). Another quibble is that the cookies could've looked more sumptuous instead of something my aunt with the arthritis and the egg-phobia would bake.

A Cookie Cutter Christmas is appropriate for young audiences. It serves up a cute, sometimes comic holiday flick with an engaging lead actress and a cute kid who, thank goodness, isn't a brat and a string of petty oneupmanship by bitter frenemies who, by the end, are infused with the Christmas Hallmark spirit. And don't even nag about that being a spoiler. It's Hallmark, for cripes' sake. And, for me, if nothing else, I picked up some tips on how to - and how NOT to - bake cookies.",1446336000,,3603,4.852032520325203

The competition goes on the rail when Christie decides to enter the cookie baking contest. Penny is an expert baker and Christie is probably the worst ever. She goes on a crash course to learn how to bake because, of course, she must win.

At the same time, both teachers are showing interest in a student's single father - again the competitive spirit rises. Thankfully, getting his interest really doesn't include mad baking skills, so maybe Christie has a better chance there than at the school bake-off.

The movie was cute and appropriate for the whole family to watch at Christmas time (and any time you need to enjoy a cute and funny movie.)

However, sad to say, we see that now from the top down, and you know who I mean.  I agree that we don't need to promote these behaviors in front of children and put them in movies or have to deal with them in politics, even if the ending shows reconciliation and a happy ending.  Watch Dear Santa if you like the male lead, and watch Finding Father Christmas if you like the female lead--two MUCH better movies.  Sometimes I think Christmas movies are put together in too much of a hurry.  If you would like another movie by the Johnson group, watch A Gift-Wrapped Christmas.  Again, we do see adults behaving this way, but hopefully less of it from teachers and persons who should be setting a better example.",1527811200,,817,4.6
