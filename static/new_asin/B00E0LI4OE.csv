8599824,4,B00E0LI4OE,"A story tells about an eight-jailbird-gang escape from a zone in Van Diemen Land, recent Tasmania, of which the most predatory Alexander Pearce proved being the most predatory among mates to survive for being hanged.

Also taking inmates as a walking meal was (and, probably, is still) a worldwide habit for escapees from jails located in wilderness (Siberia, for instance), such a graphic depiction of consuming processes either sexual or dietarian is not so common in cinematography targeting the mass auditorium.

8599825,3,B00E0LI4OE,"Van Diemens Land tells the true story of the escape of seven convicts from the Macquairoie Harbour Penal Colony based on Sarah Island in 1822. It is the most notorious tale from the colonial era of what is now Tasmania. In the film eight convicts escape whilst chopping wood. They are a disparate and desperate bunch, with the only common tie being that of criminality.

They are English, Scottish and Irish, the latter doing a lot of their communicating in Gaelic (sub titled). The film has been called `lyrically paced' in that is can appear slow. It is also a `thriller' and so the two monikers sit uneasily side by side, but both are true. The thriller part is a bit of a stretch though as everyone knows that after they escaped they were totally inept at living off the land. They could neither hunt nor forage and soon turned to the `custom of the sea', as they were being led by `Captain' Greenhill, he was thus able to explain.

They had taken two axes with them in their escape and these now became the method of despatch for who ever was chosen to be on the menu, unlike the sea custom, no lots were drawn - this is the main vehicle for ramping up the tension.

The language is earthy, coarse and vulgar (common) that is how they would have spoken and it adds to the authenticity, there is no CGI, when it snows it really is snow. The conditions look as harsh as they must have been in 1822. The use of music is minimal often letting the natural sounds tell the story, this is particularly off putting when `food' is being consumed. The violence is bloody, brutal and dirty, very few punches are pulled and it is difficult viewing. Alexander Pearce, one of the leaders also narrates in Gaelic with anecdotal wisdom like `a man with no blood on his hands, is no man'.

Directed and co written by Jonathan auf der Heide (Oscar Redding who plays Pearce also co-wrote)  has filmed this up close and very personal, he lets the natural hues and colours of the landscape paint a picture of a vast area of hopelessness - and that really works.

Where it lets itself down is in not telling the wider story. There is nothing to say how they got into that position of being transported and for what `crimes'. There is nothing about how brutal the penal colony was that would indicate their fervour to all escape from such an isolated place. Worse of all the full story is not told. Society at the time thought cannibalism as the preserve of the savage and that anyone touched by the hand of civilisation could never stoop to such a practice. Hence when Pearce confessed, he was not believed, thinking it a ruse to cover for the escaped mates. He was sent back to Sarah Island and promptly ran off with another young lad in 1824. This time the corpse (or part of it) was discovered and Pearce was caught and hanged. That would have been a much better tale and as the film lasts for 1 hour 40 minutes they could have fitted it in. So a well made, thought provoking and visceral film that does not ask many of the questions let alone answer them. This may be treating the audience as `grown ups', but from a cinematic experience it felt lacking. It is haunting though and is one of those that will stay with you.",1305504000,3,3208,4.410472972972973
8599826,5,B00E0LI4OE,"This film is based on the true story of Alexander Pearce, Australia's most notorious convict. In 1822, Pearce and seven fellow convicts escaped from Macquarie Harbour, a place of ultra banishment and punishment, only to find a world less forgiving. To survive they must do the unthinkable. Very dark gothic tale. This kind of movie probably wouldn't be made in the USA. I thought it was very well done. This DVD was excellent",1294531200,2,425,4.835616438356165
8599827,5,B00E0LI4OE,"Based on a true story, Van Diemen's land tells the gruesome tale of a group of escaped convicts who must contemplate the unthinkable to just stay alive in the barren savages of what is now Tasmania. Expertly thought, and well scripted. Highly recommended for fans of this genre",1294185600,2,277,4.791666666666667
8599828,2,B00E0LI4OE,"This is one of Australia's more gruesome stories from ye olde times. As a schoolkid you get to hear about the cannibal convicts of Tasmania and you shiver with excited horrified glee. So why is this film so pretentious and ultimately dull?

Like many Aussie films, it's well shot, well made, well acted, and well, who cares? Telling comment overheard: Hmm, saw this, the documentary was much better. How can that be?! This is purely a dramatization, it should rock! Well, it doesn't.

The story is linear. X number of 1820s convicts escape into the wilderness and rapidly descend into cannibalism until only one (Pierce) is left. A true horror story. The faults of this kind of lie with the fact that it takes too long to tell, and some of the more interesting parts of the story are summed up in three written lines before the end credits roll. Pierce was recaptured. No one believed him. He escaped again and ate somebody else, the naughty monkey. But the film makers don't show you this. Perhaps they fear you will be entertained and maybe enjoy yourself on a base level, like those wretched Bad Boys films.

Ultimately, it is hard to know who this film is for. It's not a date movie (unless it's with that German cannibal dude), it's not a horror film (virtually no tension, you don't care if any of them will make it, and anyway, you know how it goes), and it's not a historical film (there are no establishing shots of 1820s civilization, no real sense of the era and contrast between the wilderness of colony life compared to the actual Tassie wilderness). So what is it?

Do yourself a favour: see Ravenous instead. Certainly not based on a true story, but at least its a laugh. Or else see Cannibal the Musical, by the South Park boys. That IS based on a true story!",1288483200,,1775,4.5375
