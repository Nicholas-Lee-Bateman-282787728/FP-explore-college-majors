7792450,4,0792845498,"Released in 1985, Hey Babu Riba is a coming-of-age drama set in post-war Yugoslavia; more specifically, Serbia. The film starts in the present with four middle-aged men who convene at the funeral of a woman they all loved and helped escape communist Yugoslavia to reunite with her father 33 years earlier. As teens in communist Serbia, the four boys were a rowing crew and the female was their coxswain. The girl, Mirjana (Gala Videnovic), is nicknamed Esther by the guys, after Esther Williams, the American swimmer and actress, who rose to fame with movies like Bathing Beauty (1944). One of her songs from that movie is a main tune in Hey Babu Riba.

Speaking of which, the seemingly nonsensical title has nothing to do with the original title and comes from the brief appearance in the film of a recording of Lionel Hampton's ""Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop. The Serbo-Croatian title (translated) is Dancing in Water, which is too generic and explains why they changed it. This is fine, but Hey Babu Riba is unnecessarily confusing. This couldve been avoided by simply using the actual spelling of the song ""Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop. So why didn't they?

While the movies too talky and the beginning is unnecessarily convoluted, theres enough good in it to give it a marginal thumbs up, if you don't mind reading subtitles (the Language is Serbo-Croatian with subtitles available on the DVD). The film illustrates how the natural trust and naivet characteristic of teens can easily be swayed or abused. For instance, the manipulation to smoke based on the lie that it equals adulthood and, therefore, coolness. I should point out, by the way, that theres some tame (female) nudity in the movie.

Whats most interesting is the setting, the struggle between Communist and American ideals in Tito's Yugoslavia. The ""four"" are attracted to American cinema, music and styles, while their nemesis (the leader of a rival rowing crew) is a rising member in the Communist elite so staunch he has tattoos of Stalin and Lenin on his wrists.  He also happens to be in pursuit of Esther's affections. I couldn't help reflecting on how there was never a youth in America back then (the early 50s) who was fascinated by communistic ideals. Gee, why is that?

Another superb thing about this movie is the depiction of life in Eastern Bloc Europe in the early 50s. Interestingly, it wasn't much different than life in America, except for the specter of communism, which is WHY the rowing team were fascinated with the FREEDOM inherent to America and wanted to escape. Regardless, this was the first film depicting life in the 50s where I was thoroughly convinced and effectively brought back to that distant era. The actors never TRY to be from an earlier generation; they just are, and the movie works because of it.

The big mystery is (NO SPOILERS): Which one of the boys gets Esther pregnant? I suspected the answer in the first half and was right. Its not hard to figure out.

The movie runs 112 minutes and was written & directed by Jovan Acin based on the memories of Petar Jankovi, George Zecevic and Mr. Ain meshed with the life of Radomir Perica, who was jailed for flaunting a Mickey Mouse tattoo in post-war Yugoslavia.

7792452,3,0792845498,"Men yearning for the olden days awaken in this former Yugoslavian film that brings the audience back to 1950s Belgrade where a group of teens live for the moment.  What brought back the memories to the four middle aged men is the death of their beloved friend, Mirjana 'Ester' Zivkovic (Gala Videnovic).  Reminiscence shades the beginning with how these four men in their youth rowed across the Adriatic Sea to bring Esther to her father who was exiled to Italy.  The rowing feat broke up their relationship with Esther and they also found out that she also was pregnant.  However, they never did learn who the father was, but the reunion will bring back the playful adolescence as they will learn the truth.

The story is loosely based on some of the filmmaker's own childhood in Belgrade under the Soviet communist presence and the escapades they encountered amidst coming of age.  The main characters in the film are four boys and a girl who spend all time they have together.  They are full of youthful brashness and eager to learn more about all the mysteries of life.  Yet, they have an unyielding loyalty to one another and Ester is the glue to keep it all together while they all secretively have a crush on her.  Their tight friendship stems from competitive rowing where they form a five man crew.  They boys are the rowers while Ester calls the cadence.

The film Bathing Beauty (1944) with the actress Esther Williams who captured her attention also was the source that brought her the nickname Ester.  The film had a strong presence of water, which was also the main reason that these four boys were friends through rowing.  They even create their own theme song from the 1944 film, which played a significant part in their lives.  Another film with water that plays a big part in the film is the Swedish film One Summer of Happiness (1954).  The film received much controversial attention in the 1950s due to a scene where two adolescents lovingly embrace each other while naked during a late evening swim.  However, the Swedish film also reflects on the boys growing sexual awareness, as they discover more about the 1950s trends and themselves.

Innocently, all boys approache Ester, who turns them all down by saying, ""We are a four."", as if she had a strong idea of what a relationship would do to their friendships.  In the shadow of their innocent attempts to sway Ester to their side they seek other outlets for their feelings such as American jazz, blue jeans, and cigarettes.  The cigarettes receive an amusing symbolic value for lost virginity and the boys' effort to reach adulthood.  Nonetheless, the boys lighting up cigarettes suggests that someone must be behind the pregnancy.

Hey Babu Riba offers a nostalgic trip down memory lane where some sentiments will strike a cord with many viewers who have left their adolescence behind them.  Unfortunately some of the sentiments do bring a sugar coating generating a slight discord between the viewer and the story.  This discord rests within the obvious intention of trying to sway the audience in an emotional direction.  It might be ok for those still in adolescence, but us who have our own memories from the teens might feel slightly cheated.  Nonetheless, the film does brings back a sense of a lost time and place that brought us across the bridge of finding our place in adulthood.",1119744000,2,3365,4.780276816608996
7792453,4,0792845498,"Jovan Acin's ""Hey babu riba"" is a very good film about the experiences of four boys and their female coxswain friend, Esther, in 1950s Yugoslavia.  The film begins with the group of five rowing out across the border into Italy, where the father of the girl lives in exile.  Years later, the four boys are reunited at the girl's funeral, and they reminisce with a man that they really disliked about what had happened.  It's a coming of age story as all four are attracted to Esther, but none of them can have her.  It's also a story of the effects of communism, as the boys and the man are unable to save Esther's mother from dying because they had no strepomycin in Yugoslavia.  It tells tells us how far friends will go for each other.  It's sad, but yet worth seeing.",1113868800,6,770,4.387323943661972
7792454,4,0792845498,"Four Yugoslavian men living in different places, Popovic, Glenn, Sacha, and Kicha, are stunned when they hear that a woman whom all four loved died.  They meet at her funeral in Belgrade.  However, we then learn that her surviving daughter was fathered by one of the four.  The question is, who was it?
The movie then takes us back to a coastal town of Yugoslavia in July 1953, when all four were teenagers on a rowing quartet and the girl, the beautiful blonde Miriana, hung around them as just a good friend and being their coxswain.  In fact, the four styled themselves ""The Foursome"", and they called Miriana ""Esther"" after Esther Williams, whose music from Bathing Beauty became a theme tune for them.  For them, it's also a tune ""that brought us a taste of freedom.""
They also had trouble in the form of Ristic (pronounced Reestich), a man they nickname Joe, not only because that's the name he uses in his English lessons from Sacha's grandmother, but he has a tattoo of Joseph Stalin on his left hand.  On his right, there's one of Lenin.  Ristic, who bears a strong resemblance to a young Nicolae Ceausescu, dictator of Romania, is their nemesis because he is about 15 years their senior, plus he is on a rival rowing team.  Physical fights between them are avoided only due to Esther's intervention, which mollifies Ristic.  He too, shows up at Esther's funeral.
Rada, a lusty red-haired woman who is the local black marketeer, also plays a role in their lives, as they get the latest Western merchandise from her.  She has blue jeans, nylon stockings, Glenn Miller records, and American cigarettes.  She also sexually initiates all but one of the boys.  An amusing note that emerges is that each boy comes out with a pair of jeans and cigarettes from Rada.
All though, have troubles of their own.  Popov's father is a doctor banned from private practice due to the Communist regime's rules.  Esther's mother has failing health and her father's in exile in Italy.  Kicha, whose father is away, has an insufferable lodger, a woman who gives favours with top bureaucrats in her room.
The title Hey Babu Riba seems to come from Lionel Hampton's ""Hey Ba Ba Re-Bop"", and given that the teens are all jazz fans, the title makes sense.  Western jazz with its liveliness symbolized the Foursome's taste of freedom.  The scenes of childhood have that bittersweet taste of nostalgia, when the Foursome remember their beautiful friend, who loved them as she would a friend, but not exclusively to one in a sexual way.
The perception of Titoist Yugoslavia is more that of repression, as there are political prisoners and exiles of the regime, which is interesting considering how Tito was considered the ""good Communist"" by the West.  Here, he's perceived as a ruthless dictator.  Also, the line from an official, ""rulers don't last but countries do"" is ironic, considering this was made in 1987.  That year, Slobodan Milosevic was making his political start over the Kosovo debacle.  Three years later, Slovenia would declare independence, followed by Croatia and Bosnia.
This is the first time I've seen a Yugoslavian film, and given the results, I feel I've dipped into another flavour of European cinema.",1063324800,11,3206,4.835164835164835
7792455,4,0792845498,"Briefly, Hey Babu Riba is an enjoyably sentimental look at what used to be Yugoslavia, and is a fine coming of age story as well. Charmingly acted and supremely well-constructed, though I ""got it"" better on second viewing. Normally sentimentality in films is not my thing at all, but as someone with a profound interest in the former Yugoslavia who likes to see a good movie as well, I have been enjoying this film for years. (For a painful reality check, watch and compare the youthful performance of Dragan Bjelogrlic in this movie with his dead-on performance of a soldier stricken with the thousand-yard stare in Pretty Village Pretty Flame, filmed after the horrific wars of the 1990s.)",1055030400,7,691,4.864406779661017
7792456,3,0792845498,"I remember back when I was in college this used to be the only film from the former Yugoslavia you could find in the ""foreign"" section of any video store in the U.S. It's not a bad film, but compared to some of the really good films that came out of Yugoslavia in the last 20 to 30 years, it's rather middling. The story is set in Belgrade sometime after 1948 (i.e. after the Tito-Stalin split); the main characters are a group of teenagers (4 boys and a girl), so it's something of a coming-of-age film. Although some aspects of the plot are a bit cliched and predictable, the acting is generally very good, so the film is pleasing to watch. The depiction of life in postwar Serbia and Yugoslavia and the onset of the communist system is also quite good, and there are a number of very amusing scenes - particularly involving the `sacrifices' the boys have to make to get a pair of American blue jeans.",970012800,4,903,4.380952380952381
