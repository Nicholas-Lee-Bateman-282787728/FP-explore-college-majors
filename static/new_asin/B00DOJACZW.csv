8595397,3,B00DOJACZW,"Although this is a loving look at racewalking, the portrayal comes up a bit flat in that the protagonists, whom are mostly non-athletic-looking oddballs, are presented as equivalent to the real racewalkers with whom they toe the line in the Olympic Trials. The back stories are good for a laugh, but it would have been nice if some of the great British walkers who actually did make the team for London were given a bit more screen time. A good diversion for those within the racewalk community, but those outside the fraternity will probably miss the joke.",1386633600,2,557,4.752577319587629
8595398,4,B00DOJACZW,"This is a 55 minute mockumentary--a satire shot in the form of a fake documentary. The Disk is NTSC format (works in US machines) and contains no extras.
Most racewalkers will cringe at the idea of yet another mocking fake documentary. The internet is populated with puerile and unfunny attempts. Relax--here is some good news: this is well researched and has some very amusing moments. The actors have learnt reasonable (if not especially fast) technique and portray likable characters.
The opening interview with Trevor Barron and his dad seems slightly disjointed from the rest of the film; it also misses the opportunity to tell the background story on Trevor, a sufferer from epilepsy who qualified for and competed very well at the London Olympics. The plot centers on four athletes trying to qualify for the London games. Their family and coaches provide background material which varies from mildly amusing to hilarious, though knowledge of the arcane history and lore of the event is required for a few of the jokes. The discussion of how to judge a dog's walking form will probably be repeated on jocular long training walks for years to come.
This is not a documentary, but it does include an interesting collage of old race footage and scenes from a 20Km in Essex, UK, with several elite British walkers showing great form and speed. During the finale, watch carefully for an alternative view of Borchin's inelegant barrier bouncing in the London 20Km. It closes respectfully with Erik Barrondo's plea for the troubled teens of his home in Guatemala to put away their knives and take up training shoes--one of the most noble responses to winning an Olympic medal in many years.
I would have given more stars but at less than an hour, my main complaint is that it is too short. This is funny enough to make a good present for the racewalker in your life. However, if you want a real documentary you'll have to wait a little longer for Joel Legate's masterpiece to be released.",1383523200,4,1987,4.829912023460411
