5111302,5,B007V5AR64,"For years I had a grudge against Tom Cruise, though I can't remember why. But I decided to give him another try and bought this album of the MI movies. I remember the first MI movie, and I liked it. But I was really impressed with the whole four-movie series. As far as action movies though, these are quite exceptional. Whether you buy them separately or altogether, I highly recommend these.",1407715200,17,393,4.549295774647887
