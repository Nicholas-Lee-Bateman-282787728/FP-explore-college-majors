2379880,5,B000A8FRXC,"This video was not only informative, it was also very creative.  I had tried several different techniques and this by far is the best I have encountered.  I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a well mannered four legged friend : )",1138406400,,236,4.465116279069767
2379881,1,B000A8FRXC,I purchased this because of all the 5 star reviews.  What a disappointment.  The quality of the video production is poor and entire length is 45 min.  It came across as cheesy to me.  I think the people in the video must be the ones that gave the 5 star ratings.,1138233600,,262,4.078431372549019
2379882,5,B000A8FRXC,"This DVD is really in a league of it's own. I never thought I could simultaneously teach my dog new tricks and be so entertained!  The step-by-step instruction is easy to follow and the skits kept me laughing.  The positive methods demonstrated kept the training fun and rewarding for both me and my dog.  Being a music snob, I give the background music a thumbs up also.  Great buy!",1136937600,3,383,4.507246376811594
2379883,5,B000A8FRXC,"This video is great value and the easy to follow instructions  can be compared to a cook book. These are recipes for turning a loving but sometimes sour pet into a sweet delicacy. The most difficult situations encountered with owning a dog in an urban area such as making it sit, stay, not jumping on people and having it come to you can easly be overcome by following the step-by-step instructions. From the well developed introduction, background music, entertaining cast and outstanding naritaves there is never a dull moment. This is the most effective and enjoyable training aid of my experience.",1129507200,4,601,4.9504950495049505
2379884,5,B000A8FRXC,"Sit, stay, and come, too! This is not your father's dog training video. It's a modern, up-tempo take on teaching your dog all that good stuff. Turn up the music and have fun.",1128211200,3,174,4.303030303030303
2379885,5,B000A8FRXC,"This is the coolest dog training video I've ever seen. It's fun and easy to use. The lessons are clear and easy to follow, and it shows you all the basics. Really fun and hip-not boring and nerdy like all the others.",1125964800,2,216,4.166666666666667
2379886,5,B000A8FRXC,"This dvd is great because it does not incorporate the idea of dominance role playing into the training regime.  Instead, the dvd approaches dog training in a lighter tone with easy to follow, step-by-step demonstrations on how to teach basic obedience.  There's no unnecessary training jargon.  It's straight forward, simple, and fun for both your dog and the handler.  All the dogs in this dvd have never learned these commands, therefore it's especially interesting to witness the pace at which the dogs learn the tricks.

Behave Yourself sets you up with the appropriate tools to train your dog to be a polite pooch at home and in public.  It's essential to any dog owner, especially those living in busy metropolitan areas.  All training methods used in this dvd are progressive training techniques, making it fun and stress-free for your dog!  This is a great introduction to basic obedience for all experience level dog owners.",1123891200,6,933,5.012987012987013
8076369,5,B000A8FRXC,"This is a great basic training video. It is well presented in a sort of ""tongue and cheek"" way. The human clothing is a little outrageous and the actor/trainer's hair styles may take a few people by surprise, but the knowledge within the video is good and solid. This trainer knows what she is doing. The only thing that I wish they had added is closed captioning. It would be nice for those, like me, who are hearing impaired or deaf.",1210118400,,435,4.382716049382716
8076370,4,B000A8FRXC,I used this video to assist me in training my very active and headstrong english lab.  I enjoyed the music and setting as opposed to traditional videos.  The instructions were easy to understand and transfer to practical use.  It was a great introduction into basic training for new dog owners.,1160524800,,294,4.84
8076371,3,B000A8FRXC,"This is a very brief introduction to dog training.  What you learn is useful, but I expected the trainer to go into more depth.  The title suggested that the video dealt with more serious issues, not just learning to sit and lie down.  The word ""extravaganza"" in the title is totally misleading, a complete exaggeration.",1152489600,3,320,4.781818181818182
8076372,4,B000A8FRXC,"Not for your average dog owner?  Erm, let's get past the superficial.  Victoria Wells is on Animal Precinct because she is not only one of the top animal behaviorists in the country, she is also unique because she is a Rock and Roll chick.  Which is refreshing, because animal training can be ""cool"" and fun, and this dog training DVD demonstrates that.  The nuts and bolts that are necessary to get your puppy to behave are provided.

And besides, who knew that CBGB's would make a cameo apperance in it?",1150848000,,505,4.566666666666666
8076373,5,B000A8FRXC,This video is full of great concepts and ideas that are important for training any dog regardless of their situation.  Easy to follow instructions that yeild great results.  Mastery is all about the fundamentals and this video emphasizes that fact.  You'll be on your way to train both you and your hound to behave!!!,1150761600,,317,4.833333333333333
8076374,5,B000A8FRXC,"I purchased the video because I saw Victoria on Animal Planet's ""Animal Precinct."" I liked the way the video used true rescue dogs, and shows that ANY dog can learn to behave.  The video uses a repetition/reward system and shows how all dogs can master the basics of canine manners.  Especially nice are the short interviews with the dog owners and how they found their dogs.  The music is great--some of it orginal tunes by the animal behaviorists!",1150761600,,449,4.730769230769231
8076375,5,B000A8FRXC,"I found the dvd to be very informative. I've practiced some of Victoria's techniques on our 5 yr. old dog with good results, he now comes to me when I call him! I think the music and personalities added alot of character to something that could have just been a dog training video, but this one is so much more fun!",1149724800,2,315,4.180327868852459
8076376,5,B000A8FRXC,i absolutly loved this dvd my dog jackie is a changed man. the information is great and is so simple to use on your dog. its a new approach to training your dog that doesn't make you feel like a jerk. its soo good i actually trained my dog to hit the volcano. a must for every dog owner,1144022400,,286,3.864406779661017
8076377,5,B000A8FRXC,"As a novice dog-owner, I must say I didn't know how hard it would be to learn to train my dog. I didn't know it meant that I would need training too.

The trainer, Victoria Wells, breaks the learning into steps. And you actually see the dog learning from her.

Anyway, this video helped me see that I can train my dog without driving myself, or my dog crazy.",1143936000,3,358,4.173913043478261
8076378,2,B000A8FRXC,"Sorry - But this video is not for the average dog owner! If you identify with the punk rock scene and are looking for an alternative to the standard dog training video then this might work for you.  This video shows basic training techniques, but the narrator's ""voice over"" distracts from the actual training process going on. The korny doggy-do and doggy-don't skits attempt to show the viewer correct training techniques and obvious training mistakes,but are a waste of time. Maybe worth $8 but definitely not the $22.95 price tag. I would return it if not for amazon's return policy against returning opened videos.",1139443200,2,619,4.951923076923077
