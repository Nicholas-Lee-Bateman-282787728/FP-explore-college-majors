1678008,4,B00005YTW7,"Explains and demonstrates the basics very well.  I especially like the approach to teaching turns and combinations.  They don't teach set combinations. They give you basic turn components and show you how to combine them, do variations and how to flow from one move to another.  This allows the beginner to create the combinations he feels comfortable with and keep adding moves on his own as he progresses.

I must disagree with another reviewers' description of this style as 'New York on 2'.  This is a Salsa 'On 1' description of the steps.  Ron clearly describes the basic stepping on the 1-2-3, 5-6-7 and breaking (stepping forward) on the 1.
'New York Style on 2' Steps are on the 1-2-3, 5-6-7 also, but breaks on the 2.

If you are a beginner and are confused by this, I can tell you the style presented here is very widely used, the easiest to learn and a good starting point for other styles.",1115164800,12,902,4.565217391304348
1678009,4,B00005YTW7,"I bought the beginner, intermediate and advanced videos from these series. The three videos follow the same format, they first show the moves dancing together, then they break down the steps showing both the man and the female steps and to finalize they dance together again.
  Both dancers give advice on how to add a little style to your dancing and their instruction is definetely among the best. In fact, I took a basic salsa class and felt frustrated with the results but this video is so clear that even learning without a partner is possible.
  The only reason for giving it four stars is that I feel that they could have taught more moves if they had spent less time explaining the moves over and over.",1056240000,4,710,4.566929133858268

1678012,4,B00005YTW7,"NY STYLE - As the reviewer Ivan Torres did not read my review fully I must say at the beginning & the end of this review that this is a NY style in the intermediate & advanced DVD videos of this series.
Level = Absolute Beginners
The Red Hot DVD's lessons are divided into chapters meaning you can skip to the lesson you want or you can repeat the lesson for as long as you want. The case comes with a written menu to find a step or reply a step.
This Salsa DVD starts off with a demonstration of the style of Salsa taught by Ron & Bethana.
Ron & Bethana are teaching what I describe as the fourth major Salsa style.
This style of Salsa is international. I have never been to a country yet or nightclub where someone was not teaching or dancing this style. I am not sure of this style's history so it may have started in New York. In my current city over 75% of the Salsa schools teach their basic techniques this way. This DVD has a huge market.
This couple teach a very smooth flowing Salsa. This DVD video teaches you the fundamentals of Salsa. They both take turns teaching so you get both sexes views & steps. They break the steps down for both sexes so if you are single you can learn the steps as well. Ron counts the beats + Quick Quick Slow + adds music. They teach Cuban motion for the basic step. They break the steps down in directions like front, side, back. They give you options for these basic steps. They teach basic combinations so you can add the steps all together to produce a good flow.
This is a good basic very detailed DVD video to teach a good flowing Salsa. It is suitable for couples or singles.
I would also recommend this video for beginner Salsa teachers.
Note : This is one of my most favorite styles of Salsa. I use this style for Salsa Romantic & for modern NY Salsa music. This is an On 2 NY style in the intermediate & advanced DVD videos..",1025827200,73,1876,4.185082872928176

7957269,5,B00005YTW7,Excellent beginner DVD on Salsa. Easy to understand and to learn basic steps.,1485475200,,77,5.0
7957270,5,B00005YTW7,"Love Salsa and saw this video many years ago while I was learning. I'm so glad it was still available. This couple does an amazing job of explaining the moves and they're easy to follow. My only complaint about the video is that they sometimes go TOO much into detail about some of the simpler moves, but, that's just because I'm not a beginner anymore, and I'm sure that those who are just starting out will find that part useful....and for all my complaining, I simply clicked the FF button.",1410393600,,493,4.488888888888889
7957271,5,B00005YTW7,"It helped me to become a better salsa dancer. The videos breaks down steps from beginner level to semi-pro. Some of the routines that I learned in there, I have been using them for years and it always create a smile on partner's face.",1395792000,,234,4.340909090909091
7957272,2,B00005YTW7,"this is one dance video where ron and bethana did not make the grade.  there were just a few dance steps included here that are too basic and does not have
that latin flavor that you find in josie neglia's dance videos.  i would recommend instead josie neglia's salsa levels 1 and 2 and levels 3 and 4 which shows
more fantastic dance routine that has that latin touch which you see in latin clubs.",1355184000,,398,4.293333333333333
7957273,2,B00005YTW7,"This DVD set was disappointing as it is not made clear that it will describe mostly dancing ""on 2""
The Set is sparse and the quality is poor.
Instruction seems to be badly scripted - if at all...

Not really very useful.",1324944000,,220,4.238095238095238

It can be adapt to dance in 1. It is excellent for the beginner. They explain the lessons very well.",1316476800,,199,4.351351351351352
7957275,3,B00005YTW7,"They are good teachers, no doubt, but they teach ONLY one kind of Salsa, New York Style Salsa which is danced only for a small portion of the Latin Community. At least they are really good and can teach you the basics for this style but don't be surprised if you try to dance Salsa with somebody and you couldn't get the moves.
Who dance this style? well, mainly puertorrican.
You could try ZUMBA, they have some interesting salsa moves.
Si eres latin@ mejor practica con otro tipo de video, este es bueno pero solo te ensea un estilo que no es muy popular.",1193097600,,557,4.365384615384615
7957276,4,B00005YTW7,"I purchased this product because I am taking dance lessons for Mambo/Salsa. I wanted something I could use as ""HomeWork"" to reinforce the lessons being taught by a professional dance school...

For that purpose I am very satisfied with the first DVD I have reviewed, it has fulfilled its purpose so far. As far as trying to learn this stuff from scratch, I am not sure how helpful this product would be. For instance, what I was actually hoping to get a deep dive understanding on is ""Cuban Motion"", which is at the heart of many of these Latin Styles. It was barely touched on in this DVD, but is such an integral part of these dances.",1179100800,,636,4.435897435897436

7957278,1,B00005YTW7,"This it is the third tutorial that I buy, not the worse but the price is too much for they show or they teach, few combinations, few patterns and very little explanations with out teaching the tecnic. Definitively you can unite the beginner level and the intermediate level to make a single dvd, because the intermediate level is less contained sample. They dance very well, good style but, not enough figures.",1141603200,,410,4.788732394366197
