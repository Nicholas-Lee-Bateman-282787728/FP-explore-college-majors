8198650,5,B000R34X5S,"This is a very well made production.  This motivational video can be used for any type of youth group (educational or church). It is not a religiously based video so it can be used in schools.  Very good topic for helping youth to use common sense and good tools in their life to be successful.  It is really good for any age group, not just the youth.",1388102400,,352,4.223880597014926
8198651,5,B000R34X5S,"This is an outstanding, entertaining, funny, heart-warming, value-affirming video of a live presentation to a high school audience.
It is non-denominational.  I am so glad my teen (and pre-teen) girls have viewed it.  They laugh and love it!  Presents excellent examples, provides inspiration for teens.  They come away motivated to be a better person, and less self-conscious/self-involved.  As a professional therapist I can also use clips from it working with individual/family clients.",1277942400,3,489,5.736111111111111
