8221087,5,B000W2P5BK,"This was my favorite movie in the 90's when I was a little girl. I was sooooooooo excited to find it because I want my kids to watch it--but I'll confess, I watch it on my own too! Such a great story of a little orphan girl who gets the chance to become PJ Sparkles and travel to another land to help children in need. The kind of wonderful, corny, brightly colored, song-filled magic only the 90's could deliver. I adore this movie!",1405036800,,433,4.228915662650603
8221088,3,B000W2P5BK,"PJ Sparkle is an older movie. It starts out with PJ, an orphan with no parents. One day she wishes upon a star and is transferred to twinkle town. She transforms into PJ sparkles, who spreads love and care throughout the land despite the dislike of her enemies, who try to do the complete opposite and take over twinkle-town by making everybody MEAN. This is a good, cute story with a moral. Pick it up if you see it.",1237680000,3,417,4.291139240506329
