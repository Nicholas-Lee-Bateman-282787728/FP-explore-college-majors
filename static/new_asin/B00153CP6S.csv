8257248,4,B00153CP6S,"This is so far my sixth seen production of Parsifal, and so far it is the second ranked for me. First would be Met Opera production with Kaufmann, Dalayman and Pape. And then this. Vocally and Musical performances are great in this Zurich production. Naef and Ventris give an outstanding rendition of their roles. Salminen as always great.

The only thing I am not very impress is with the words projected on the curtains, they are unnecessary, provided that they found very good symbols to represent many ideas, why bothered to write actual words over the scenary

If you are a traditionalist, do not choose this production, since it is very very modern.",1398384000,,655,4.787610619469026
8257249,4,B00153CP6S,"This is a generally excellent performance of Parsifal. I defer to the previous detailed reviews which give a reliable idea of the singing and production. For me, the primary asset of this interpretation is Haitink's superbly judged and rhythmically secure conducting. The music evolves at a stately pace and the Zurich Opera Orchestra produces a thrilling sound. The singing is generally accomplished with a standout performance by Matti Salminen as Gurnemanz. The sonic and visual aspects of this issue are outstanding.

My problem with Parsifal is that magnificent as the music might be, the tortured proceedings of the plot (everyone seems to be suffering so much of the time) makes me conclude that this work is better heard than seen. Of the other DVDs that I have seen, the traditional DG Levine is tolerable to view and is expertly performed. The production of the oft praised Nagano/Berlin version is a shocker and should be avoided.

Wagner fans will of course ignore this advice, but I will preferably opt for the musical purity of the excellent Karajan and  Knappertsbusch CD versions. Nevertheless, this Zurich DVD would be my first choice as a visual experience of Parsifal.",1245715200,10,1187,5.076923076923077
8257250,5,B00153CP6S,"Whatever it was that kept Bernard Haitink out of the opera house for so long certainly didn't effect his abilities in the pit. This is not only one of his best recorded operas, by far, but one of the best recorded Parsifals I've ever heard. The smallish orchestra of Opera Zrich, mostly younger players, delivers a rich sound, full-bodied but never thick or opaque. Haitink shapes a marvelously seamless, integrated arch from the preludes to the final curtains of each act.
The physical production, by Hans Hollmann, is a curious affair, but I find it more satisfying than, say, the Met's generic and meaningless ""naturalistic"" staging. Hollmann pairs down the story to a basic good vs. evil (i.e. light vs. dark) interpretation, which is, while true, somewhat limiting, since the fundamental theme of the opera is redemption through compassion. But it is difficult to translate compassion into a visual metaphor. Projected onto the rear scrims is a single word: WASSER for Act I sc. 1 (to indicate the sacred lake?), BLUT  for the Temple, and QUELL (wellspring) for Act III. Something to make one think, perhaps, or a cheap substitute for scenery?
The costuming is mostly modern dress, with Parsifal and the Grail Knights in 19th Century suggestive double breasted jackets, squires in what appear to be waiter and busboy uniforms. Is the Grail Temple a cooking school? Kundry wears a modern pantsuit in slinky black, changing to an unfortunately un-flattering sequined gown for the Magic Garden scene, and ultimately a Carmelite nun's habit (from where...Nuns are Us?) Amfortas' chef whites are stained with blood over the heart, not where the ancient stories say. The swan is enacted by a human player with the same wound.
Matti Salminen delivers some star wattage as Gurnemanz, his gruff characterization goes well with his vocal delivery, but he can be very touching in the quiet moments, such as the swan's death. Christopher Ventris has been the Parsifal of choice at Bayreuth for several years, and certainly knows the part and all its nuances, but his voice is rather underpowered for the biggest moments. Swiss contralto Yvonne Naef has the vocal equipment for Kundry, but seems a little tentative at times. However, she negotiates the daunting octave-and-a-half and two-octave leaps uncommonly well. She is an affecting actress in the outer acts, less effectively seductive in the second.
I find the Amfortas of Michael Volle absolutely riveting. You will hear the role more beautifully sung by the likes of Jos van Dam or Bernd Weikl, but not since the days of Thomas Stewart have I seen such a perfect integration of singing and acting. Unfortunately, nothing of the like can be said for Rolf Haunstein's Klingsor. After crawling out from under a giant shaving mirror, he enacts nothing more menacing than a cranky old rich guy, neither evil nor insinuating. The smaller roles are well done, with some peculiar acting parts added.
Musically, this production stands up well against any other recording, CD or DVD, especially in the orchestral and choral work. The production is challenging, occasionally perplexing, but often deeply moving. The Grail temple scenes, in which the Grail itself is seen only as a brilliant golden light dividing day from night, are gut-wrenchingly gorgeous. DGG's production of the video is exemplary, although on-screen menus are limited to the beginning of each act. You will have to refer to the accompanying booklet for individual cues. Subtitles provide the Lionel Salter translation from Decca's 1972 Solti recording which, while accurate enough, is sometimes at odds in tone with this production's style.",1231113600,11,3652,5.12751677852349
8257251,5,B00153CP6S,"When I had heard that Bernard Haitink returned to the world of opera, in one of my absolute favorite works and was being released on DVD, there was no question I'd snatch it as soon as it was released, and so, I did.

Unfortunately, the affair is a mixed big, but the reward at the end is huge and, ultimately, worth it.

Musically, most of this Parsifal is exquisite. Haitink's utter control over the Zurich forces is nothing less than remarkable - the orchestral playing as good as it gets. His shaping of the music - particularly in the first and third acts, is often breathtaking, with that shimmering sound one always imagines but doesn't always get to hear. There is almost a Mozartean quality to Hatink's Wagner - a lightness of touch in those sections that sometimes in other hands comes off simultaneously as dense and soft and just ""supporting"" when they are as important as breath itself. Several moments: Gurnemanz's lengthy monologues, Amfortas's great Act III solo and Parsifal's entrance into the third act grail ceremony are as beautiful as anything I've ever heard. Almost heartstopping really.

I was a bit let down with the introduction music for Act II, Haitink makes it sound too clean and well scrubbed, when this is fierce, demonic music - as violent as anything Wagner ever penned and here it lacks that threatening quality I always expect (and usually get, if sometimes sloppily so).

Singing here too is mostly top drawer. Pride of place goes to both Messrs. Ventris and Salminen for roles they have become almost exclusively identified with at this stage. Salminen's great arias are dispatched with such gentle authority that one almost feels comforted by his gentle giant presence from whence pours that glorious, rich soulful sound. He's amazing. Ventris has a crisp, marvelously youthful sound that is perfect in this role, particularly his third act.

Yvonne Naef has problems at Kundry's highest range - most of those notes are either shrieked out unpleasantly, or barely touched and let go. It's a pity because the rest of her range is exquisite, singing with such emotional intensity and beauty - and her involvement with the role and stage presence is the best of the entire cast. If you don't mind a few misplaced screeches, her Kundry (in my opinion) is comparable to Meier (who seems to get all the Kundry gigs these days).

Vocally, Michael Volle is about as perfect an Amfortas as one could ever want. His big moment in the third act for me was possibly the highlight of the entire evening. He is simply marvelous.

The chorus is mindboggingly good; almost as though the angels in heaven had a day off and decided to spend it in Zurich. Seriously.

The problem comes with Hans Hollmann's production. It is one of those affairs that got me so rattled at the beginning that I had to turn it off to calm myself down because I couldn't hear the music anymore. I'm not proud of that statement as I think one of my few good qualities is to look past that which bothers me and try to take in the whole. I couldn't do it. It took three tries before I could watch the first act without clenching both teeth and fist.

WARNING:  Spoilers Ahead (If you still want to watch this with ""surprise"" stop reading here!)

The first and third act take place in a classroom in a boys' school. The enormity of the stage is almost bare, save for a couple of ""desks"" that rise and fall from the stage floor, and the now required, handful of awkwardly placed wooden chairs. The word ""wasser"" is projected in light on a scrim on the rear stage wall in enormous letters, then is repeated in smaller letters around the scrim. ???? Later ""Blut"" and other words will appear - (in act II ""Blut"" fills the entire rear wall in red theatre marquis lights).

The costumes by Dirk von Bodisco are the worst I can recall seeing. The ""boys"" all in gray trousers, matching double breasted vests and feminine shirts. Some of the older men (like Gurnemanz) all look like Captain von Trapp (as does Parsifal throughout the final act). Kundry is in a black power pantsuit, her short locks sporting a lengthier styled Channel pageboy.

Almost everyone is blind, and the great entrance of the Grail Knights following the transformation music (wherein Parsifal and Gurnemanz merely walk in place shifting from side to side in a terribly leaden pantomime of motion), finds the knights gingerly moving about the stage with blind men's canes and faces devoid of a single emotion. They also carry what looks to be dinner plate sized cheeseburgers (we later realize they're just giant bread rolls for the communion service to follow).

The Knights line up, showboy style, facing stage left, turning their faces to sing that glorious music to the audience. Awkward? You betcha. Oh, throughout the show, Amfortas is wheeled about on a large gurney, but standing up Hannibal Lecter style. He rises from the gurney to conduct the Grail ceremony. Then something happens and director Hollmann produces a scene of such exquisite beauty, the grail ceremony itself becoming one of the most beautiful images one can imagine for this scene. It is truly stunning and mighty in its power.

Act II finds the stage plunged in darkness, a giant pentagram and five tall candlesticks (which Klingsor later places at the points of the pentagram). There is a ladder and a giant mirrored disc (we can see Haitink in it at one point). Kundry is on the other side of the disk. Rolf Haunstein sounds fairly old and tired as Klingsor and Hollmann's actions for him almost define the word ""cliche."" As he sings, a number of figures are seen in at the rear of the stage, blind men stumbling along - with buckets on their heads? I think that's what I saw.

The Flower Maidens are blind as well (and blindfolded to prove the point). Gotten up unattractively in metallic bustiers and long, shapeless black skirts, they do little before producing large plastic squares in over bright, flourescent primary colors that they wave about. A few of them drop theirs. Later Kundry (now in an unfortunate sequined black gown with an enormous inset of garrish sequined colors - red, green, blue - her hair now long and plum colored) picks up one of these colored squares and almost seems to be reading the score from it. Parsifal takes it and stares at it in wonder and amazement, the idea being the non-colored side of these big squares is a mirror that reveals the past. Or something like that.

As Klingsor reappears to wound the lad with the spear, the spear - an enormous pipelike th ing slowly shoots from the rear stage wall high above Parsifal's head. He raises his hand and ""pretends"" to grasp it, though it's still a few feet above him. A big red tube clumsily descends from the flies and moves toward's Parsifal who stands beneath. Since there is no magic kingdom to cause to crumble, a rear scrim opens and we see the FlowerMaidens collapse to the floor. It's better with your eyes closed.

The final act looks as awful as the first, but ends just as spectacularly, moving me to tears. There is a mute young man in all three acts and we find him in Act III dragging the stiff lifeless body (with legs in the air) of one of the pages from the opening act. Mute Boy stares at the audience making horrified looks of terror and pain on his face. It's too, too much. Kundry, having been asleep for a year or so - unnoticed by Gurnemanz in his classroom, leaves and returns in a nun's habit. And on and on it goes. BUT then, Hollmann works theatrical magic and the simplicity of the final grail ceremony, is shattering, just perfect. And Haitink, Wagner and company match the stunning visual in breathtaking fashion.

If you can put up with the stilted silliness of about two-thirds of this, the payoff is a spectacular one. I'm a little uncertain, but I almost feel this is one of those performances that might have been better released only in audio format as I can know there are people who will never make it to the end of this. I'm glad I did.",1226361600,24,8004,4.651804670912951
