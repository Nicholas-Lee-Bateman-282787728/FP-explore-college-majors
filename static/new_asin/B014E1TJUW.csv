7389378,4,B014E1TJUW,"This show is one for the ages, a true gem of high production values, (mostly) fantastic storylines of romance and intrigue.

I have pre-ordered S6, like all the other seasons. But I wait, rather impatiently, for PBS/Masterpiece/Carnival to grow up and give its patrons of the high-priced DVD/Blu-Rays versions of the episodes that match what is actually aired on PBS.

I am sick of having the ""UK"" version pawned on us. The UK version is roughly what is aired on ITV. ITV has commercial breaks played during Downton Abbey (making it a surreal viewing experience with Old El Paso commercials in between dinner scenes, not to mention having the X-Factor as DA's lead-in). These commercials make episodes 2-7 shorter than what viewers see almost everywhere else, including, most notably, the PBS version in the US. Enterprising fans have found this out, noted where the differences are, which does roughly track the amount of time that is lost in the UK to commercials. Why not give US viewers what they expect to see when the purchase a DVD/Blu-Ray/Streaming copy of this - the version they see aired on PBS?

It's weird enough that the DVD/Blu-Ray, etc. are made available mid-season in the US as it is. PBS would already have its edited versions available to be included on the product it's shilling out to fans at Amazon and elsewhere. PBS simply chooses not to, short-changing us all in the process.

It is a continuing disservice to fans that they do not get to own what they see during a PBS broadcast.

Maybe they will release a ""US"" version of all seasons, costing an arm and leg, of course. Maybe I will buy it. Until then, every single DVD/Blu-Ray review related to Downton Abbey will have 4 stars from me.",1449187200,18,1714,4.738255033557047
7389379,5,B014E1TJUW,Love Downton Abbey. Season 6 was no exception. Matthew Goode was a nice addition to the cast. Mary & Edith are at it as usual and some people finally get their storybook ending. So sad it's come to an end.,1448755200,6,205,4.15
7389380,3,B014E1TJUW,"Season 6 is finally here and Downton Abbey is finally at its end. After watching all 8 episodes as well as the Christmas special finale, I can definitely say this season is much better than the last two seasons which have been a chore to get through. It is still by no means as lovable as the first two seasons, though.",1448409600,12,319,4.245901639344262
7389381,5,B014E1TJUW,"The year long wait for the new Downton series always seems like an age, especially this year as we knew that it would be the last ever series.  It seems perverse that such a successful series has had to end, however, as the incomparable Maggie Smith said, if you work it out I should be about 110 years old by now!  A slight exaggeration, but you can see where she is coming from since Downton has run from about the time of the Titanic disaster in 1912 all the way to 1925.

The TV series has now finished in the UK and for those of you waiting for the North American showing or DVD, it was an absolute cracker and if you enjoyed the first five series of Downton, you are not going to be disappointed with the final series.  As would be expected, there was a certain amount of tying up of loose ends, but not to an excessive extent.  However we still have the Christmas Special show to air at the end of next month so everyone is waiting in suspense for the final conclusion.  Incidentally if you are impatient to see the last series, although the UK issue is released this month, that will not contain the 2015 Christmas Special whereas the later North American release will.

It is difficult to single out the outstanding performances in series 6 as all the regular players had significant roles.  It was good to see Tom back, and others such as Mrs Patmore, The Bates, Barrow, and Daisy below stairs and, of course, all the Crawley family are in the thick of things.  Maggie Smith, as the Dowager is very much in evidence and her priceless sarcasm includes many a memorable line.  Overall, without dropping in any spoilers, there was romance, tragedy, blackmail, suspense, joy and sorrow.  In other words exactly what you would expect from Downton!",1447200000,392,1752,4.495268138801261
7389382,5,B014E1TJUW,"Lost interest in this series when Matthew was killed but just recently finished watching seasons four and five and am again loving it.  I will not buy these videos but will watch it on PBS starting in January.  We also just finished watching the documentary on the castle where this series is filmed.  The owners love Downton Abbey!  Of course they benefit financially from the filming but I think it's more than that.  I believe to them it brings back to life a lost era when times were simpler, albeit unfair to the less fortunate classes of people.  It will be interesting to see the evolution of the Crawleys as they move into their future.",1447027200,23,644,4.556521739130435
7389383,5,B014E1TJUW,Watching it on itv.com and loving it.,1446595200,10,37,4.428571428571429

7389385,5,B014E1TJUW,"Even though it us not out here in USA yet, I have seen 3 episodes so far and being an avid Downton Abbey  fan, I love it! Worth buying if you have all the other seasons!",1444521600,55,169,3.6944444444444446
7389386,5,B014E1TJUW,"Since only three episodes of series 6 have aired in the UK, a review thus far would be rather premature. Thus far, the production qualities remain top notch, the cast is excellent, and I'm sure those who adore the programme will find much to love.

So I'll use this space to address the continued worries over a so-called ""American version"" of Downton Abbey:

Way back in January 2011, the Daily Mail, a British tabloid that's a hybrid of US Weekly and the National Enquirer, posted an article accusing PBS of editing the first season of Downton Abbey because Americans were apparently too stupid to understand the entail. As the Daily Mail intended, this article set off a storm of accusations and anxieties over whether we Americans were getting the real version the Brits were seeing on ITV. And this story is still being circulated, as seen in the discussion section below.

The only thing PBS edited out of season one was the snuffbox storyline, likely because it was redundant when the stolen wine storyline was exactly the same.

Once the Daily Mail article lied about the reasons for the PBS editing, and Downton Abbey became so popular in the US that PBS was able to attract high quality funding, they not only aired the episodes as they did in the UK, but sometimes added scenes that weren't shown on ITV (since ITV airs commercials and has to cut things to fit around them).

PBS now stamps their Downton Abbey DVDs ""UK Version"" because people are still passing around the story that they cut the show up liberally. The ironic part is that by only releasing the ITV versions on DVD, you'll never get to see the extra PBS scenes unless you record them as they air.",1444176000,235,1674,4.641891891891892

7389389,5,B014E1TJUW,"I missed Season 6 when it aired on PBS so I am extremely excited to own a copy of the season that brought all the stories together with a phenomenal ending. Perfect for a rainy day or when the News is too much pop this in and get lost in the story.
Now if I could only find the DVD The Weddings of Downton",1533513600,,305,3.78125

7389396,3,B014E1TJUW,"For a show that for the first five seasons kept you on the edge of your seat with things going wrong, this is a rather cringe-worthy feel-good ending that plays to the audience's sentimentality.  Every time a problem does come up, it's neatly resolved five minutes later.  And the very end is almost laughable the way it provides a happily-ever-after ending for almost everyone.  Seems like love is suddenly springing up everywhere--Edith, Mrs. Patmore, Daisy, Mrs. Crawley, Branson (hinted at, anyway)....The only sad note is Carson's forced retirement, but even that becomes only semi-retirement and provides Barrow with his dream job.  I'm as sentimental as the next person, but it's a bit much.  Oh well...overall, a great show.",1531526400,,732,5.169491525423729

And it strikes me that an earlier point in the Downton period would make a lovely series, even if a limited one. I would love to see the story of The Dowager played out, so many wonderful hints were given about her earlier life, as well as the courting of Cora by Robert and their young life together.",1531008000,,380,4.148648648648648

Amazon Video sucks.

I cannot stream video because I do not have access to broadband Internet and it seems all video over data is slowed down.

You cannot download a purchased video to a computer.  That makes it rather difficult to play the video on a TV.  If I cannot watch something I've purchased, on any device I so choose, I do not really own it.  That's not all right.

This is why people pirate media.",1526860800,,445,4.289156626506024

One thing that stands out to me that I don't think I have ever seen in any other series is the topic of changing times and how it affects lives. Emotionally, it touched me profoundly, at times made me tear up, overall it brought me to a high level of happiness that makes it feel hard to let go of the show and sad that it ended.

I really wish they would bring it back. The only thing I was maybe a little disappointed in was that I wanted Mary and Thomas to fall in love. I wish it continue, I didn't quite understand why Edith's new husband couldn't adopt Marigold and make it look like they had both adopted her so Edith could then call her daughter instead of her ward. I think that would have headed off scandal more than calling her a ward and Edith could finally here her daughter call her Mommy.  I would love for Roseline to adopt a little girl, or even an older girl. And I would to see Barrow and Spratt together.

7389470,5,B014E1TJUW,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The discs play fine. The first five seasons had swinging plastic pages to hold the discs. The sixth season stacked all of the discs on a single plastic peg.

Downton Abbey captivated me for several seasons. It was different, unlike any other series I was watching. I enjoyed the entire series and plan on rewatching the show. The locations and scenery and likable characters were great. It's not without its flaws. For instance, in the fourth season I was wondering what Thomas' job was. All he does is stand around, spying on people. Is he the spymaster? In season five I found some of the situations and characters tedious and boring. But overall I liked the series very much.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2143,5.445783132530121

7389537,4,B014E1TJUW,"I'd give the whole series five stars except for two things - the gay character (Mr Barrow) has no redeeming value and is right out of the Hayes Code stereotyping, including him being a coward. I'm surprised he wasn't killed off after being discovered as a serial killer. Maybe Julian Fellowes is some nutcase Christian, but the reality is this character is inappropriate as presented, and really has no reason to be that way. The same holds true for Denker, the Dowager's ladies maid. I love the actress who plays her, but the character has no redeeming value and no motive for having no redeeming value, unless Fellowes is making some obscure statement about mental health. At least the sole black character wasn't presented as some drug pushing pimp stereotype, and was treated with respect. Likewise with the Jews.

I'm not saying the Crawley family should have embraced homosexuality with historically-inaccurate open arms. But watch the Celluoid Closet documentary and you will see Barrows ticks all the homophobic buttons of the Hayes Code, and I sincerely doubt every gay man in 1920s was a conniving evil coward only seeking to destroy people for no reason.",1512345600,,1165,4.9743589743589745

7389576,5,B014E1TJUW,"I enjoyed the show and was very pleased to see Edith find someone who loved her despite the fact she had given birth to Merigold. The one thing I found very interesting is how the family was so conservative but still realised (in the 1920's) Thomas couldn't help being gay. I loved how they defended him even though there were times he deserved to lose his position.
If there is ever another remake of 'Gone With The Wind' Mary would make a great Scarlet, but I seriously doubt in today's politically correct society there will ever be a remake of such a classic piece of theatre.",1506988800,,580,4.481132075471698

I'm glad to have caught up on all the episodes, but I was sad to see the show end. Downton Abbey is very much like a soap opera, as I guess most period dramas are, but as far as soap operas go and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best. It's well-written and well-acted. The end of the series was very satisfying, although I'll admit to being a sop and crying at several moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes period drama at its finest.",1499385600,,554,4.285714285714286

Bravo Downton Abbey, as that is not usually the case for season finales. The storylines of all the characters that I've grown to love in the last 5 seasons are fully flushed out - and with an all-around happy ending! Nothing seemed force either, which is typical for series, which goes to show the dedication and care that the writers did. I'm sad to say goodbye to Downton, but at least it was a happy farewell.",1491696000,,563,4.423076923076923

My favorite part was when Mrs. Crawley came in to Dickey's house with Violet and swept him off his feet and out of his house.  She rescued him from being trapped and controlled, which was a truly horrible situation, and in so doing she brought both of them great happiness.  I would like to have seen more of a pairing up between Branson and Miss Edmunds the newspaper editor, Braxton and Mosley, Daisy and Andy, and Mr. Mason and Miss Patmore, but enough of their potential connections were suggested to make a happy and satisfying end to it all.

From Lord Granthom all the way down to the simplest of roles as Daisy these characters came alive.  The story casts a microscope on what life was really like in this Chapter of England's history viewed from the grass root level.

From one experience to the next I could hardly wait to get started with the next episode.  The story lent itself well for binge watching.  Like that book you find that is too hard to put down so was this series.

7389871,4,B014E1TJUW,"I never watched Downtown Abbey when it was on PBS, so I was happy to have the opportunity to watch all 6 seasons straight through on Amazon. I have to agree with many of the comments regarding the last season as seeming a little rushed and story-book-like in its attempt to tie up all loose ends. Lady Mary's character, especially at the end, wasn't very attractive. Although she was managing the estate, she didn't really seem very involved except on a superficial level. This might have given her a little more interest. Her romance and marriage, although having some drama and conflict, didn't show any real development in the relationship. The show was obviously running out of time.

All that said, I did enjoy the series and was sorry to see it end.",1486771200,,755,4.676691729323308

7389876,5,B014E1TJUW,"So sorry to say goodbye to the whole class. I would say I enjoyed this series more than any other TV series I ever watched. I was hooked after the 1st show. Why did I resist it while it was still showing on TV? Because after being nagged by friends and family about watching it, we did tune into a random episode and it just didn't click. The series built and kept you informed. It just didn't work to try to watch it from the middle...for me anyway. This series is so worth the time spent plugged in.

7390209,5,B014E1TJUW,"some love the British accent, the British behavior, the British characterizations, the British sensibilities, the British insouciance, the British class society of the olden days, and the British values as they relate to honor and societal status.  It's all here in the Downton Abbey series, where all of life's pain, joy, thrills, guilt, worry, and love and suspense are found in the aristocratic and the common levels of British society.  Set at the ""big house"", Downton Abbey offers splendid character development of both the wealthy as well as the servants, as a captivating in-house duality survives a fading way of life in war torn Europe.  Modernization is on the rise, as electricity finds its way into society, followed by telephones and telegraphs, automobiles and airplanes, and the rise of the proletariat slowly closes in on the old money families who survive in their castle-like estates.  Lots of stories within stories within stories, and interesting relationships between classes and among classes are artfully crafted using well developed characters who garner your attention and your favor by their unique personalities.  It's quality stuff, folks, with intelligent discussions and credible acting, and it simply pulls you into their world.",1485907200,,1259,5.403061224489796

7390647,5,B014E1TJUW,"I enjoy the show but Amazon Prime streaming has sucked since mid-December. If you sign up for PRIME for the streaming benefits, it is NOT worth it because Amazon won't address why ANYTHING that's streamed has to buffer every 4 to 10 minutes.

7390681,5,B014E1TJUW,"There's really nothing new to add to my reviews of Downton Abbey. I have loved the entire series.  I believe some of the very best writing and acting can be seen in this series.  My sorrow is that it had to end.  It would be such a joy if someone would pick up the Crawleys in the mid thirties and take them through the second World War, which would have changed the Abbey completely.  A new generation of Crawleys.  However, the writing would have to be stellar and the acting every bit as good with Mary and Edith and spouses being the parents of that new generation.  I would miss all the other characters who would have aged out of the show, but those who remained would be perfect!",1485129600,,686,4.27906976744186

It is a sweeping period drama by Julian Fellowes, which features superb writing, set design, acting, and development of the story line.

But my heart never stops craving the romance and fairy tale lives of the privileged.  Downtown Abbey swept me into the confluence of the rich and powerful as they managed the people that served them.  All the while showering me with the masterpiece paintings, antique furnishings, dinner place settings, etiquette
and manners plus the reminder of what civil discourse is.  The gardens and country location were also an added bonus to the excellent story, superb actors, and breath taking representation of ""how it felt"" to hear the Titantic sunk, that WWI began as well as the consequences that followed these events.  It is a rare find to have a tv series more intriguing than a book, but Downton Abbey rises to that occasssion.",1484784000,,829,4.851063829787234

I have a few very minor criticisms, but not really worth mentioning given the over-the-top excellence of Julian Fellows' writing and dramatizing of those crucial times in British history.  It brilliantly explained through character development and incidents how England came to be the society it is today, light-years away from the aristocracy and personal limitations of the early 20th Century.  Well worth watching the entire series.",1484697600,,521,5.628205128205129

7390824,5,B014E1TJUW,"My girlfriend and I were enticed by this show when it first popped up on our radar and it is truly a beloved and fantastic jump into the early 1900's British culture and comparative drama. Our favorite character was Matthew, he was totally a boss the whole time, no bs personality. Mr. Carson and Ms. Hughes rally the whole family and staff together through the trials of the First World War and the tragedy of the titanic, it dates itself into a time of post Victorian to the modern era.

7390918,5,B014E1TJUW,"Downton Abbey is one of those shows you know it is an instant classic and nobody will ever produce something like it again. The plot was on point and dozens of great characters during the 6 seasons. My favorites are Lady Mary, Lady Rose and Carlson. What a great show. Already miss it. That is why I bought all 6 seasons in blu ray to watch whenever I need. Recommend to anyone who appreciate good TV.",1484524800,,401,4.2894736842105265

8730444,1,B014E1TJUW,"Welcome to Downton Abbey! If you've had a great day, this will ruin it.

This was well acted but very predictable. I called every new development with 100% accuracy. That's not a good show.

I wasn't crazy about the flogging of ""it's a new world"" concept. It certainly could have been subtle and played out, not spoken by every character over and over ad nauseum. I don't need a flashing billboard to understand a concept.

Speaking of being sick to the stomach, the Mary character made Caligula look cuddly. I don't understand making her as vile as she was - and yet she holds everyone in thrall? Not believable. If the writer thought he was creating a 'heart of gold, but with a tough exterior' character, he missed completely. She had two side:  vicious as a demon, to not quite vicious as a demon. I loathed every scene she was in. She looked like a dumbstruck statue most of the time. Who wants a central character without expression 90% of the time?

There were an incredibly lot of very nasty characters. But even the nicer people were annoying as hell with trying to mess up their lives, the constant self- deprecation, and general foolishness. I couldn't listen to my best friend dither over every decision like that.

The young men were not portrayed well. It was very unrealistic to see then madly in love with people they've seen at maybe two dinners. Everyone of them gets kicked to the curb (despicably by that thug Mary) and every one crawled back for more. Really?

Who could believe that those 3 daughters were raised by the Lord and Lady Graham? The sisters. were all very distasteful. Thank God they killed Sybil off quickly. I wanted to cut my throat listening to her.
Tom Branson tested my patience with 5 season's worth of ""Do I belong here? I do belong here. But do I belong here""?
I couldn't eaten and watched this show.

In short, this ridiculous series was tedious and pointless as a paper cut. Very light on actual story telling. It should have been titled ""Downton Asylum for the Stupid and Self-Defeatingly Insane"".

I really would be shocked if I knew anyone who liked this pap.

Maggie Smith was delightful as ever. What a mismatch

The ""goof not goof"" lengthy explanation of why 2 blue-eyed parents have brown-eyed daughters is the perfect metaphor for this ""unnecessary and pointless"" series.

8730445,5,B014E1TJUW,It took me years to finally sit down and watch Downton Abbey.  How grateful I am for PBS!

May we be fortunate to view wonderful shows as this one.  Thank you to the cast and crew for sharing a beautiful part of history.,1535587200,,364,4.1571428571428575
8730446,5,B014E1TJUW,"While this show can be self-gratifying and self-serving to the extreme at times, it humanizes every character and responsibly juxtaposes the difficulties of the lives of the upper-class with their servants and communities.",1535500800,,222,5.757575757575758
