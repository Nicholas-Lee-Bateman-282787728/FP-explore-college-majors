8611440,5,B00F1BG020,"Super documentary on the rescue, care and release of stranded California sea otter pup #501  by the Monterey Bay Aquarium team of marine biologists.  It is a fascinating account of the work of these dedicated men and women who struggle to rescue these keystone marine mammals so vital to the preservation a healthy shoreline ecosystem.  It's the kind of documentary that you can see over and over again and keep in your collection of all-time favorites.  Incidentally, sea otter 501 recently had her third pup in the wild according to the news report I saw.",1424304000,3,557,4.831578947368421

The link provided in the comment section shows how important are these otters. Shame.",1407283200,3,538,5.416666666666667
