8189269,5,B000P6R55W,"It copies the original nearly scene for scene.  There are is one major change in one of the characters, other than that, it copies the original scene for scene.  If you can get over the poor camera work, lack of make-up effects, and script changes due to language barriers, it is worth the watch.  I had never heard of this move before;  what a treat it was.",1508630400,,358,4.298507462686567
8189270,5,B000P6R55W,"What is real?  Where does the ""meaning"" of something come from, and is that that ""meaning"" more original and truthful than the thing the meaning stands for?  Is there such thing as an original or is every thing always already a sign intending x to y?  In other words, does the thing stand for the meaning or the meaning for the thing?  Plato argued that a non material dimension was the source for the things we experience.  What comes first, the idea or the object the idea refers to?  Even when we abandon the myth of the dimension of forms we see that we are still haunted by the insistence that at some point versions end with an original and authentic type.  What is more real, then, in this case--The Exorcist or Seytan?  Perhaps evidence from the Cornell studies of psychologist George Lowery here illuminate the possibility that neither film comes first and both are instead a circular flow of social psychic energy where the creators of the Exorcist and even Blatty before them could only haver ever created their works if this Turkish film was created later.  The end makes the beginning possible.  What is time?  If linear time does not exist, why couldn't something that happened later just as well have happened sooner in the sense that it neither is sooner or later.  Seitan is not Seytan.  Lowery is a seasoning salt but not the first which demonstrates origins do not matter where taste is concerned.",1500854400,6,1416,4.661290322580645

the acting SUBLIME
the photography PERFECT
the effects STUPENDOUS.

if you like the U.S version you will ADORE this WONDERFUL experience of filmic NIRVANA.",1456617600,3,218,5.228571428571429
8189273,5,B000P6R55W,"This is 5 stars on the ""Plan 9"" scale: movies so bad, they are good. However, I have to give it 1 star for video quality, very poor transfer but considering this movie was hard to find for years, beggars can't be choosers. Like others have mentioned, the film is yellow for the first 20 minutes or so.
The Exorcist is my favorite movie of all time so even though this is a rip-off, it's so horribly pathetic, that it's enjoyable. Also fun are the subtitles, at one point the translator gave up being serious. My version does not have an English dub, so reading is required. If you like having Bad Movie Nights with friends, this is a perfect choice.",1357948800,7,649,4.371900826446281
8189274,2,B000P6R55W,"This Turkish version of THE EXORCIST is a candidate for one of the worst films ever made. Poorly edited, with rudimentary dialogue and special effects, it is a travesty of the original Hollywood version. By comparison with this effort, Edward D. Wood jnr., PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE - generally accepted to be one of the worst films of all time - is a masterpiece. Best watched late at night after a heavy night drinking in the local bar.",1345593600,,439,4.569620253164557
8189275,2,B000P6R55W,"Having a bit of an obsession with the original EXORCIST film directed by William Friedkin, I was curious to see this Turkish version, reportedly a scene for scene unauthorized copy though one with a minimal budget.

I admit that I got the DVD to heckle with friends after hearing about the less than inspired special effects and the voice of the demon sounding like a ""drunken pirate."" As it turns out it is not a great heckle film, falling prey to the ultimate reason for most anti-heckle worthy films, that of being listless, slow and dull.  However, taken as a curiosity, it's worth watching once if you can make it through even that far.

True to its reputation most of it is indeed a scene for scene remake of the original EXORCIST, although there are some major changes in the story. One presumes that all the elements of Catholicism in the American film have been omitted here for their irrelevance to most Turks or perhaps from an aversion to portraying such clearly defined aspects of faith and religion in a fictional story. We instead have a battle of wills between a more or less generic idea of good vs. evil.  The young priest from the original film is here a doctor of psychology and author of books involving inner demons, free will and the effects of them upon society and human nature.  The older ""Exorcist"" is some rather ill-defined expert in battling evil and in the minimalist exorcism scenes he spouts plenty of generalized faux-ritualistic chanting and quoting that only seems to be religion based.  Perhaps it is significant to Turkish people and their faith, but if so, it went past my limited knowledge of the country.  Most of the other characters are pretty true to the original, the mother, the 12 year old girl, the detective, etc.  There are minor variations here and there, but they pretty much stick to William Peter Blatty's blueprint.

The production itself is, of course, laughable compared to the original film, but it is not without some inherent creepiness mostly due to the echoes of its progenitor.  The acting isn't bad, particularly by the mother, who is much hotter than Ellyn Burstyn, haha, and the actress who plays the possessed little girl is also very effective given that she has to do a lot of the physical deformities without aid of special effects. No, she does not turn her head completely around all by herself, but much of her efforts to appear ""possessed"" are done purely through her own movement and expression.  What effects there are can't match the original in any way, shape or form, but for a low budget and without any enforced comparisons, it is acceptable for a cheap horror film. The music is a hodge-podge of just about every type of mood cue, with a special emphasis being on endless repeats of Mike Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS, with nary a credit to Mike in sight! For the most part however everyone involved in the film, both in front of and behind the camera, SEEMS to be taking the film very seriously and with an approach so earnest it's as though they were laying claim to the brilliance of the original all on their own.  I would assume that the Friedkin film was not released in Turkey prior to this one, so no potential audiences could cry FOUL upon seeing this last page Xerox.

The DVD is abysmal in terms of quality. It's true that the film itself probably never looked all that great, but the transfer of this DVD doesn't give it any chance at all.  It is murky, dirty and so soft it looks like 8mm blown up to 35 and then transferred to VHS in the -EP- speed.  One would think that would only add to the heckle-ability of everything, but instead it is just distracting and depressing. The subtitles are a trip all on their own, with a limited grasp of English and often with bizarre footnotes marked by an asterisk underneath them and even some editorializing about the film itself!  It almost appears as if the translator made notes about his translations and the folks burning them onto the film thought EVERYTHING on his notes were intended to be used.  At one point in an exchange using Latin, there is a translation that says ""Search GOOGLE.""

I cannot recommend anyone buy this DVD, but it is worth a rental at Netflix.  I don't think there is any repeat value to the film, so it's not worth owning, but as a curiosity and a relic of the Exorcist frenzy that swept the world in 1973-74, it's worth watching.",1201651200,6,4394,4.61025641025641
