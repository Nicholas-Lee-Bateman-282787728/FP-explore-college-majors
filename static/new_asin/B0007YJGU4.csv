8054091,5,B0007YJGU4,"I am a capoeira instructor and been around it for almost 6 years now, I've seen any dvd about capoeira this is surely one of the best around if not THE best. Try also the ones done by Capoeira Brazil (Mestre Paulo), they're quite good.

8054092,5,B0007YJGU4,"First off any potential buyer should realized the dvds in this set are in a PAL format which is more common in western Europe and parts of north Africa. The U.S. uses dvd players that are NTSC formatted. I learned this information after purchasing the Capoeira 3 dvd box set. When I finally played it I was suprised (and a little annoyed) to realize that none of the three dvd disc would play on my panasonic dvd player which is only 3 years old. However, the dvds would play on the dvd on my macintosh computer.  I did buy a more recent phillip dvd player for about $40 and it does play the dvds in PAL format. (Colors are not that great though and tends to make the screen flash like old computer screens.) Most new dvd players have this feature of playing both PAL and NTSC.  Older models may not so check you dvd player's guide or look on the internet to see.  If not you can spend $30 to $40 on a new dvd player.

With that said of the format I will focus on the content of the material of the dvds.  This Capoeira dvd set consist of three dvd titles; `100% Regional,' `Rodas De Capoeira,' and `Basic Techniques of Capoeira.'  Each of these titles are also sold separately and I have done a more in depth review on each of these titles on their own page on amazon.com.  So search each of these dvd titles on amazon for those reviews.  The DVD's are made by a French producer Christophe Diez (reason for the PAL format).  The footage takes place between Brazil and France.  I will say that each of the dvds are the best I have seen on capoeira.  I also own other titles such as Advanced Capoeira with master Sergipe, Brazilian Style Fighting Capoeira 1, 2, and 3.  These titles do not come close to the dvds sold in this package as footage and entertainment of watching goes.  The producer of these titles has also produced two other capoeira dvd's that are not in the box set that are just as good, `Capoeira 100% Spectaular' and `100% Capoeira.'  I also have a review on these two as well.  Each of the dvds that Christophe Diez has produced has great camera angles and editing.  The camera is not left on a tripod like other dvds on capoeira.  The camera follows the action and held without tilting or bouncing.  Because of the great editing and camera work I give this box set of capoeira a five star even if the format is PAL. If you are into capoeira and have been doing it for a few years and like the history, music and movement that this art offers you will enjoy this box set.  I will also recommend the other two titles as will.
