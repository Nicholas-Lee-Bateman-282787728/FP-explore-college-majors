8283964,5,B001BOMBVK,"When I see this label's DVDs with no reviews, I hesitate. I'm sure glad I purchased this one. The quality of this line is all over the place, from poor to spendid, this one falls in the latter. Of course, 1979 isn't that long ago, so it's in color, has great sound. You have a great crew of George Cables on piano, Rufus Reid on bass, and Eddie Gladen on drums. This is a great concert, I wish all of the great artists could have lived long enough to capture them on dvd of this quality. On this concert date we have Dexter playing soprano sax on Alone Together. Wow. If you are a Dexter fan, you'll want this one.",1238371200,16,614,4.125
