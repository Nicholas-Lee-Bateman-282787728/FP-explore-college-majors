Sorry, guys. This one's only about The Emperor's Candlesticks as I haven't seen the other two movies in this collection.

It's a cypher to me as to why The Emperor's Candlesticks was a flop when it released in 1937. It has so much going for it. It's a star-studded cast what's spearheaded by my favorite all-time actor in William Powell. MGM's lavish treatment ensures that the picture looks just great and gives off that decadent Old World gloss. It's sophisticated and witty and chock full of comic intrigue and diverting cat-and-mouse games between the two leads. It's based on a book by the Baroness Orczy, the author who created two remarkable characters in the dashing Sir Percy Blakeney and the mystery-solving Old Man in the Corner.

The plot serves up that classic chestnut about spy versus spy. Set across the breadth of pre-World War I Europe, it pits urbane Polish agent #14, Baron Stephan Wolensky (Powell), against the beauteous Countess Olga Mironova (Luise Rainer) of Russia's Secret Service. See them chase each other and trade in flirty banter and ply their spycraft against each other, all for the sake of obtaining an elusive pair of antique candlesticks, each of which boasts a cunning secret chamber that contains precious state documents. Rumor has it that Marie Antoinette herself conveyed her very last letter to Vienna by way of one of these candlesticks. The neat hook is that Wolensky and Mironova had each placed their respective documents in one candlestick and the other, each of them unaware that the other had done so similarly.

And what's at stake? What's the hubbub? Why, only the Grand Duke Peter (Robert Young), son of the Russian czar, held hostage by ardent Polish nationalists. Why, the fate of a Polish patriot what's been condemned to death. What's at risk? Why, the stone-cold hearts and professionalism of our two opposing spies. Throw in a pair of thieving servants to gum up the works, and the entire affair gets even more dicey.

It's so redundant to say that Powell is in top form because he's pretty much always in top form. I've reviewed enough of his pictures that I've run out of new things with which to laud him. So I'll rehash. Guy is dapper and clever and witty and just comes across as the ideal gent. Luise Rainer, I haven't seen much of her, but she certainly has a presence and I enjoyed her, even if, at times, her performance comes off just a tad too mannered. But she and he generate a fine romantic chemistry. There are many moments of them simply sparkling together. For a spy movie, there isn't much of a sense of jeopardy. It's not a heavy film. Instead, the plot takes its cues from the lighthearted tone and the romantic ambiance. It's a vibe that suits Powell eminently. A merry chase across Europe. Shenanigans on a train. Our spies habitually sneaking away from each other. Our spies trying to outbid each other at an auction. Tack on a bit part as a rueful femme fatale for the very comely Maureen O'Sullivan and even a cameo from an 18-year-old Carole Landis, and I'm still scratching my head as to why this thing flopped.

By the way, did those candlesticks ever end up at their intended destination, I wonder? Is old Prince Johan still mooning over that Russian princess? Maybe I should clarify. Or you could just watch the movie.",1442534400,,3439,4.771428571428571
8425467,5,B004DK6D9U,"Legendary Luise Rainer passed away today, approximately two weeks shy of her 105th birthday. Nicknamed ""The Viennese Teardrop "", Rainer (pronounced Rye-ner) should be admired for more than her admirable acting. Winning back to back Oscars in the 1930's (and the first person to ever do so), Rainer walked out on Hollywood for a number of reasons. Suffering in a stormy first marriage, she also shunned wasting her time on what she considered the artifice of Tinsel Town. Constantly at odds with Louis B. Mayer over her refusal to live the glitzy glamour-puss life, flatly rejecting his sexual advances and her relative displeasure over being cast in roles...like these! That having been said, these films hold up as entertainments, and Luise is excellent in all. True, as noted these disks will play in most standard dvd players only, but if buyers READ all of the information, they know that going in. The films are in no way restored, but they are treasure to anyone who loves classic films...especially with an appreciation for Ms. Rainer's gifts, of course. Rainer regretted not making more films, but not turning her back on the Hollywood games. Enjoy these fun celluloid moments of a great actress who didn't want to be a great star. Further, be certain to own THE GOOD EARTH, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD and THE GREAT WALTZ on dvd...in that order.",1419897600,3,1345,4.9035087719298245

8425469,4,B004DK6D9U,"These are three gems, especially ""The Emperor's Candlesticks"" which is a wonderful romantic period espionage movie.  Beware though that the DVD itself seems to be a ""MOD"" which means it only plays on devices that only play DVDs (not on machines that copy).",1325116800,4,256,4.953488372093023
8425470,4,B004DK6D9U,"Just a quick note: I have 70 or 80 of the Warner Archive DVDs and have yet to find one that will not play on my Samsung player. And where else are you going to find these Luise Rainer films? I purchased the set for the William Powell film and found the film quality on all three films,though not the best, acceptable. I would have like some bonus features - biographies, etc - but I am okay with that, it is the films after all, that count. There are no chapter stops but the chapter stop on my remote does advance the film in ten minute jumps. Perhaps someday there will be restored versions of these films but, for now, these are fine.",1318204800,7,637,4.186991869918699
8425471,3,B004DK6D9U,"Positiv: The set contains 3 movies with now almost forgotten two-times-Oscar-Winning-Actress Luise Rainer which was born in 1910 in Germany and still living (!) in London (in Vivien Leighs former home).

The movies are not bad if you like b/w, costume movies - and I like all 3.

I have ordered the Louise Rainer Collection once before and sent it back because it would not play on any of our lap tops and only one of our TV DVD players.

  This warning needs to be put up front BEFORE someone purchases it.
  The movies are great, my favoite is ""The Emporeror's Candlesticks"", but you may have trouble finding a machine that will play them.",1299196800,12,641,4.482758620689655
