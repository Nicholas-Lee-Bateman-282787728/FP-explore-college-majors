7820278,5,6302043174,"Up to date for its time.  Starts out just for kiddies, but eventually has some interesting science to relate.  The play part of the little drama is cringe worthy, but at least someone cared about the Solar System's former god and nuclear furnace neighbor to Earth.  Burn baby burn, but it's not burning like coal.  Sorry POTUS, the inner secret of Sol has nothing to do with JOBS in the oil and coal mining industry, except that most energy started in Sol.  Ironic ?  Uranium not mentioned but fusion is.  Kill our climate using dead plants from millions of years ago.  Eliminate the Science departments, Earth observatories, and EPA, by the ignorant White House.  Why does it have to be Mister Sun ?  Solar sexism.  Thank Mister Sun for skin cancer ?  Fickle god indeed.  Need vitamin D?  Need sunburn ?  Safe to go back on the beach ?  Maybe POTUS should see this film.  It avoids anything controversial, except the age of the Earth and Sol.",1499299200,,943,4.550898203592815

7820284,5,6302043174,"Our Mr Sun is a very entertaining, nostalgic film and well worth seeing if you remember this movie or others in the series. I'm Eric Niderost
and I wrote a book on the Bell Science Films, SONNETS AND SUNSPOTS; DR RESEARCH BAXTER AND THE BELL SCIENCE FILMS, currently available on Amazon.  In fact, I give behind-the-scenes details of the film in my book Some of the film material is dated, of course, but even after 50 years half or more still holds up-- and rarely had science been presented in such a wonderfully entertaining way.  If you remember the great Dr Baxter, this is for you!!",1410048000,,588,4.537735849056604
7820285,5,6302043174,"This ""mini-movie"" was one of a series of the old Bell (Telephone) Science presentations, hosted by Dr. Frank Baxter and first seen by me when I was an elementary school science student in the 1950s.  The goal was, of course, to make science topics fun and easy for kids to learn, in the hopes that more kids would pursue careers in the sciences.

Although I enjoyed these instructional videos immensely, I chose a career path in the arts, rather than concentrating on scientific endeavors.  Yet, I was given a much better understanding of some topics (and received higher marks than I might have, otherwise), due to these videos.

Even today, their messages (for the most part) are still valid and might do a most credible job of encouraging youngsters to explore scientific occupations, upon graduation from high school.",1385683200,2,821,4.927536231884058

IT REALLY HELD THE ATTENTION OF STUDENTS WITH ITS FRANK CAPRA FORMAT AND ITS HOST,  DR. FRANK BAXTER. MANY SCHOOLS STILL USE THIS MOVIE, 43 YEARS LATER.IT  HAS  GOOD ANIMATION, A GOOD SOUNDTRACK AND MR. SUN IS MARVIN MILLER (THE VOICE  OF ROBBY THE ROBOT).
