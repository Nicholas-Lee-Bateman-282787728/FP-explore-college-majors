3007520,1,B000XTLVIS,This Blu-Ray is advertised as being Region A but will not play on my Blu-Ray player. It may be defective. I have been unable to contact the seller but I am going to return this somehow or another.,1440460800,,196,4.184210526315789
3007521,4,B000XTLVIS,"The movie was awesome, it had a nice plot, and all that.  If you have never seen the original Zatoichi movie or series then you will probably appreciate the rich storyline and various other features that were introduced in this film.  However, if you are a fan of the original film you will notice minor differences in the storyline that, while entertaining, can be a little bit distracting or annoying if you are aware of them.  There are just way too many differences to describe.  At least one supporting character's name was changed.  Most scenes have differences in how they play out in the storyline from the original, and those differences range from minor to glaring.  The brother and sister geisha couple and hints of homosexuality were most definitely not in the original, though they did add a fresh feel to the movie.  I wish the director had put his talents into an original project instead of those movie.  If you want to know what this movie feels like, think Samurai Champloo, live action.  That's roughly what you get with this movie.",1439337600,3,1051,4.730769230769231
3007522,5,B000XTLVIS,"Such a great movie, the music is just so wonderful and fitting to the action.  This is one I've wanted for my collection since it first came out on dvd.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a samauri genre fan or of the Zatoichi universe.",1438646400,,240,4.085106382978723

3007525,4,B000XTLVIS,"I've had some problems getting my Sony PS3 to play this blu ray, despite it being region free (the irony of Japanese products not working harmoniously). Will try to use another player.",1408147200,,184,4.78125
3007526,5,B000XTLVIS,"Let me say right off the bat that I am a huge Kurosawa fan, but I have to write that this is probably the best Samurai film  ever.  The usual great swordplay scenes, but the film takes off from there.  There is a scene half way through of folks sitting in a house listening to the rainfall outside. The flashbacks make it one of the great Japanese Movie scenes (and this is really saying something!) and there is the thing with the linking of the film score and the working of folks...every thing they do is in rhythm with the sound track music and really cool once you tumble to it.  Every stroke with a plane or strike on a chisel or slash of harvesting a rice crop is all done as part of the music...perhaps unique in cinema.  Not to be missed if you are a student of film!
I had resisted watching this for some time, having seen many of the earlier Zatoichi films and not realizing just how different it really is.  Be sure to watch to the very last second...there is a twist!",1403136000,6,980,4.213903743315508
3007527,4,B000XTLVIS,"Takeshi Kitano is a former comedian, actor & now director. He became relative well known in the west with his cop/gangster characters in movies such as Violent Cop, Outrage & Brother, where he played enigmatic & often brutal roles. For Takeshi Kitano, Zatoichi  was a fresh foray into film-making taking on an old genre and a legendary character.  Kitano has pulled it off with aplomb mixing humour, drama & incredible action sequence together with visual & cultural elegance. The final scene may take some viewers aback, but the juxtaposition of a modern aspect with the ancient story works - and wonderfully so. The background score is also a unique attraction.",1370217600,5,663,5.0181818181818185
