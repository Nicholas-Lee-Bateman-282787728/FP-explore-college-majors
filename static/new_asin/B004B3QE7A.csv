8421489,5,B004B3QE7A,This is an extended version of another DVD available from Amazon. The opening segments (which is the added footage) must be from the director / narrators old home movies collection and they are priceless...Thank You. As asecond generation Italian American who grew up in New York the footage brought back memories of what life was like in a gentler era. The old home movie footage was the best part of the DVD for me.,1307491200,9,417,4.648648648648648
