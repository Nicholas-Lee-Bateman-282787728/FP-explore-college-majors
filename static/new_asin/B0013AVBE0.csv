8592873,2,B0013AVBE0,"If your just beginning working out this is NOT the workout for you. They don't explain the moves and seem to jump from one thing to the next. Theres no ""teaching"" involved. You watch the lady do it once then you have to do it. I found this extremely confusing, and I have done many dance workouts before. I'm also in pretty good shape, the moves are just really hard to pickup. Another thing I don't like is how your interrupted in the middle of your workout to hear ""a tip from gary"" this is EXTREMELY annoying. Your just left there for a minute or so while this guy gives you a workout tip. This would be a nice feature if it didn't interrupt you while you were working out. The instuctors also have english accidents which I find a bit hard to understand. This workout will get you sweating, or it did for me at least because I just ended up running around the floor for 45 minutes. I do NOT recommend this to someone unless you have professional dancing in your background.",1208908800,2,977,4.315217391304348
