1717941,5,B000067J3D,"I think some of the other reviewers did not actually watch this DVD!  It has ALL the great moments of Reagan's presidency (Inauguration, Evil Empire, Challenger, D-Day, along with lots of great jokes, including the age joke in the debate against Mondale, etc... etc..., including virtually all that another reviewer claimed was missing).  The only speeches of import that are missing are from BEFORE his Presidency, which is implied by the subtitle:  A President's Greatest Moments.  It even has the entire tribute film that celebrated his great Presidency at the '96 convention. For anyone looking for an inspiring and uplifting compilation of all the highlights - and one that moved my staunch Democrat mom to tears - this is it!",1041724800,51,731,5.066666666666666

7963432,5,B000067J3D,"The unique thing about this DVD is that it lets you make up your own mind.  It is not very long and a bit grainy but you can plainly see just how much integrity Reagan had as well as his love for his country.  Compared to what is happening today its two different worlds.  Who would ever think that the 1980's were the 'old days' - but times have changed.  If you want to remember or learn for the first time what REAL leadership and DUTY was all about, watch this DVD !!!",1393632000,,472,4.043010752688172

Thank you President Reagan",1199750400,3,107,5.0
7963435,2,B000067J3D,"Greatest moments? Not really. This is a decent compilation for neophytes who have never heard of Reagan but I would look elsewhere. If you have the money to spend first I would recommend the more comprehensive ""Ronald Reagan: The Great Communicator"" (MPI) which is a treasure trove of rare clips from a mindblowing GE commercial made in the 1950s to an extended look at the greatest moments of the Reagan presidency. Every clip you need is on that series. Otherwise, I thought PBS did an admirable job--basically a balanced look--but lacking the one thing Reagan fans crave: Reagan in his own words.",1088035200,28,599,4.882352941176471
7963436,5,B000067J3D,"This is a very important video to buy.  It is history retold, not by revisionists who will no doubt trash President Reagan, because the history books are, after all, written by leftists.  Just look at the outpouring of love for this man after he passed.  You will never see that again when our other presidents pass, not George H.W.Bush.  Not Carter or Clinton or Gerald Ford.  There are people all over the world that turned up to pay respects and say ""thank you"" to President Reagan for their freedom.  Ask just about anyone in the eastern block nations and people in Central America, not the communists.
God Bless Ronald Reagan.  The world is a sadder place now that he's passed.",1087171200,28,682,4.633333333333334
7963437,5,B000067J3D,"I teach high school government and I use this video (to great effect) to show the students why Reagan was {is} loved by the American people. I gave this video 5 stars for what it is: which are mostly his highlights - it is great for discussion or jarring one's memory. What this video is not - is a comprehensive look at Reagan life or his administration.
  After seeing the out pouring a grief and love for this man during his funeral, only an ultra left-wing liberal can still deny his greatness. Can anyone seriously believe the nation will respond the same way for Clinton or Carter's funeral?",1086998400,32,597,4.518518518518518
7963438,5,B000067J3D,"Ronald Reagan was such a great man. This dvd only scratches the surface. Buy it. He did a lot for this country, and this dvd is worth having for you, your children and their children!",1086825600,14,183,4.257142857142857
7963439,5,B000067J3D,"The photo of a smiling Reagan on the cover of this video is all the incentive I need to put it in my shopping cart and, as they say here at Amazon, ""proceed to checkout.""

Ronald Reagan is the greatest American in history and the very definition of a great president. We've had so few of them - Coolidge, Nixon, Bush, and that fat guy, the alleged drunk who used to be on ""The Wild, Wild West"" - and Ronnie baby stands above them all as a man of vision and courage.

Who but Reagan had the guts to stand tall against those freaky environmentalists and inform them, in that confident way for which he is famous, ""DO YOU KNOW that trees cause more pollution than industry?"" Whenever Reagan said, ""DO YOU KNOW..."", well, it was like that moment in ""True Grit"" when Duke Wayne put the horse's reins between his teeth to free both hands and with a rifle in each, went after the bad guys, one of whom was Dennis Hopper, that hippie who made ""Easy Rider."" Your heart beats faster, your palms begin to sweat, and your faith in justice is restored. Whenever Reagan said, ""DO YOU KNOW..."", You KNEW he was going to put some shaggy-haired, glassy-eyed liberal freak in his rightful place.

Now, thanks to this video, you can relive many of the Gipper's most inspiring moments. One great moment is missing, though. Remember when Reagan said ""Facts are stupid things""? Has anyone ever dared utter such courageous words?

There'll never be another Reagan, but one was enough.",1076544000,26,1461,4.5437262357414445
