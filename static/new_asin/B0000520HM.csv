1388337,3,B0000520HM,"I like working out with my shaper ball because it makes exercise seem more like fun and less like punishment.  But because I needed more guidance on this new piece of equipment than was provided on the chart that came with it, I turned to Kathy Smith, my fitness guru for guidance.  I thought, Kathy has not yet led me astray, and I bought this video without question.
Granted, the living room backdrop isn't too inspiring, but that would be easy to overlook, if only...
The atmosphere on this tape is very odd, from the moment Kathy introduces her friend, a muscular man in bike shorts, to the end of the cooldown stretches.  More than is necessary, Kathy puts in infomercial-like plugs for the shaper ball, which, presumably, if someone bought this tape, wouldn't they already own and love their shaperball?  Another thing that adds an element of ""weird"" to this tape is that Kathy's friend talks too much for an exercise video.  There seems to be this weird flirtation between the two of them.  Imagine if you will, the ninth grade JV basketball player who has a crush on the senior girl who's captain of the cheerleading squad.  That's what you have here on this tape.
But the exercises!  Once you get past the flirtation and the infomercial, the exercises would be pretty good for a beginner or someone who wants to have a less-intense exercise day, but still put their body in motion.  Maybe the thing to do would be to go through the tape twice, and then you'd get a rigorous workout.  It certainly isn't up to the standards of the other Kathy Smith videos I know and love.",1015977600,22,1580,4.570921985815603
1388338,1,B0000520HM,"This is the most boring workout I've even done!  This is the first Kathy Smith video I've bought and on the other viedos she's done she has great reviews so maybe the other people that have posted are just speaking on the fact that they like Kathy Smith, I don't know.
I couldn't even make it through the entire thing without being bored to tears and it's only 30 mins!  It's just her and another guy in a living room, no music, nothing.  You may do it once but you'll never want to do it again.
Also, I'm not in that great of shape and it was extremly easy.  They show you beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of every move and I had to do the advanced on every one just to even get any kind of workout.
If I could give this video 0 stars I would.  Don't get it!",999302400,22,772,4.086092715231788
1388339,3,B0000520HM,"My thoughts on the video... (1). Each exercise is not done with enough repetitions to have much of an effect - maybe this is because it is a timesaver video or something along those lines. At any rate, the exercises suggested are alright to good (with the exception of the ab exercises and the leg exercises using the ball against the wall -both of which I especially liked :)) but you need to do more of them that what is seen in the video for them to be effective. (2). The ""advanced"" variations are not that different from the ""basic"" and yet for some reason (which I find confusing)the person working out with Kathy makes it seem like he is actually feeling an effect from them...hmmm...perhaps I am doing them wrong?? (3). The reason why I gave this video a few stars is that I just took the exercises that they showed in the video and combined them with some other ball exercises that I got from other sources to make a more complete workout. The video is therefore effective in presenting some ideas for working out with the ball but I probably wouldn't actually do the video again.",996019200,8,1089,4.477386934673367
1388340,3,B0000520HM,"I have many of Kathy Smith's tapes and enjoy each one of them. When I saw that she had a tape on using the shaper ball, I was ecstatic. I bought it, got prepared to workout and I must say that I was disappointed. I expected more from her. The video is too short, the exercises are not done for a long period of time and I didn't feel anything at the end. The only good thing about the video is it acts as a guideline for exercises you can do on your own. She gives you quite a few. I recommend that you do the exercises on your own and for a longer period of time. I found this helped me.  To sum up, buy the tape if you are looking for a guideline and exercises to try on your shaper ball. Do not buy the tape if you are just going to follow the half hour routine.",989971200,18,765,3.811320754716981
1388341,1,B0000520HM,"I was hoping for much more than this video gives! I was not CHALLENGED in doing these exercises!  & being approx 50lbs over-weight, having back problems + being OUT of SHAPE...  I should have been.  I DIDN'T even feel like I got a workout!!!
I believe much more can be done w/a physio-ball than this video gives. It is too short & not extensive enough in the variety of exercises. + I feel Smith rushes through explanations of the positions & the exercises both.",986256000,14,462,4.476190476190476
1388342,4,B0000520HM,"Reading that a shaper ball workout is good for those with lower back problems, I asked for and received a ball/tape combo for Christmas.  The video tape the combo came with was not very clear, so I was overjoyed when Kathy Smith developed this workout.  Balls are really the rage and I've seen them at gyms and in retail stores.
1 - The workout definately allows you to do exercises that may be painful otherwise.  I was stretching my full abdominal cage muscles, both upper and lower.  You really get a full lower back workout, which is where I needed to focus.
2 - Kathy Smith takes some precious time to review the moves, which is fine when you are first beginning.  However, once you have the moves down, I would recommend to begin as soon as she moves to a different position, to get the most out of your workout.
3 - This is not a cardio-buster workout by any means.  While my body felt well stretched and worked, my heart rate stayed only slightly elevated.  I would recommend pairing this video with a strong walk or an upper body weight session to get your heart rate up.
4 - The more you do the exercise (which falls in the category sculpting and toning-according to Kathy's category)with the ball, the more stable and firm you become.  At first I was wiggling all over the place on the ball. You can't believe how much stablizing you do to keep yourself still to focus on the move itself.
5 - This is a good balance and toning tape, and I would recommend it to those who want a low impact, yet strengthening routine.  One thing I am disappointed in is that she doesn't do push-ups off the ball, which is very easy to do (and on my first tape).
I'm used to high cardio workouts using the Firm tapes or Kathy's cardio tapes.  It really brings it down a notch, so don't be disappointed if it's not the fast pace you are used to. Another problem is that she doesn't tell you how much air to put in the ball, which according to my manufacturer's instructions, says, ""sit on the ball so that your legs are at a right angle to the floor.""  It took several times to get the air just right.
And one more thing - for those who have several Kathy Smith workouts - she still does the ""high five"" at the beginning, but this time with the ball!  Kind of corny, but a Kathy Smith tape wouldn't be the same without it!",980380800,77,2313,4.291954022988506
1388343,4,B0000520HM,"In just 30 minutes you can have a great lower body and abs workout that is gentle on your body and still challenging. However, there are a few of things you should be aware of before getting this video: 1) you must have the right sized shaper ball. You should be able to position yourself on your hands and knees with the ball between your torso and the floor. My shaper ball is too big, so I am unable to do any of the ""beginner"" versions of the exercises. 2) Definitely wear shoes while doing this video-Kathy recommends it, but I tried barefoot anyway. It was way too challenging without the traction shoes provide. 3) Also, it helps if you have a wall within visual range of your television. One exercise puts the ball between you and the wall. Once you have all this in order, it is a great workout! The air cushion the ball provides makes many traditional exercises more comfortable to perform, while actually giving them greater effectiveness.",979689600,,950,4.56140350877193
1388344,5,B0000520HM,"I felt like I was in heaven after doing this workout.  Of course Kathy Smith is an excellent teacher, but the star of the video is the shaper ball.  It works your abs in such a way that you finally can target your abs without hurting your neck, and it puts you in comfortable positions that you just can't get into on the floor.
Plus, its fun!  My mom thought I was nuts when I brought this home. But thats what fitness is about, trying out new things and seeing what helps you acheive your goals.  This workout is easy, alot of fun, and the stretching you get is the best feeling in the world.  Along with a toned body!!  I cannot stand traditional ab cruches and sit ups. Uk!!  You cannot stick with something that you hate to do.  Which is why this workout is so great.",979257600,7,772,4.168918918918919
1388355,2,B0000520HM,"Kathy Smith, why on earth did you use a ball too small for your height?  Stability balls come in different sizes for your height.  Knees should be parallel with hips. There are other ball workouts out there that are better than this one.",1106352000,4,237,4.488372093023256
1388356,4,B0000520HM,"I just got a stability ball, and this was one of the first workouts I tried.  Kathy and her assistant, Michael, begin with a 6 1/2 minute warm-up:  moving with the ball held in your hands, stretching using the ball, and sitting on the ball both to open your hips and to get used to balancing.  Next comes a 7-minute abs segment which includes a total of 4 exercises:  the first three work your upper abs, lower abs, and obliques respectively while seated on the ball, and the final works the side muscles.  The following segment consists of a series of back extensions, the first performed face up on the ball and the last last two performed face down; this section is 6 minutes long.  The final section, which I clocked at 9 1/2 minutes, focuses on the lower body.  I found the hamstring work to be particularly tough as well as the three sets of wall squats (the last two are performed on one leg).  The workout ends with a single stretch, no cool-down, for a total of 29 minutes.

There are two things that I really liked about this video:  1) Kathy shows three different levels of modifications for every exercise, so you can make each exercise easier or more challenging, and 2) brief stretches are included between many of the exercises, and these feel so good on the ball.  On the negative side, I did not feel that this workout was very intense, as I would have preferred if Kathy had spent less time instructing and more time actually performing the movements.  Furthermore, I would have liked to have seen some upper body work included in the routine.  Overall, however, this was a decent introduction to ball work and would be good for those who want to build back and lower body strength.",1105747200,15,1700,4.516339869281046
1388357,3,B0000520HM,"I am a real fan of Kathy Smith.  Her cuing is always clear and her movements are not too ""dancy"".  In addition, she typically presents helpful and effective exercise education in her workouts.  While this was true in this tape as well, I was a little disappointed in the quality of her routine.  It appeared more personal and less scripted than most of her other routines, but the energy Kathy usually brings to her workouts (even the yoga workout tape) seemed to be missing in this one.  It had a bit too much ""infomercial"" approach for my taste (a complaint I also have with some of the other popular workout names).

That being said, there are helpful moves and good information in the workout, and I will continue to use it.",1105056000,,728,4.519083969465649
1388358,4,B0000520HM,"I really love this workout.  It's easy to follow and is presented in 10-20 minute increments that allow you to fit the workout in to a busy schedule.  My only complaint is that the DVD cover indicates that there is an ""exclusive 20 minute stability ball workout"" included when there is not.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 stability balls  to go with the 2 DVDs I bought (one for me and one for a friend) before I discovered this.  I have sent 2 emails to customer service on the Kathy Smith website and have received no reply...very disappointing.",1077148800,2,543,4.556701030927835
1388359,1,B0000520HM,"not a good exercise routine, Smith is past her prime and her teaching style is lacking, she needs to step aside and quit producing weak videos like this. The moves were overly talked out and the seemed very boring. Smith was good, was! Leisa Hart is so much better, try her On The Ball Abs video instead.",1069286400,2,304,4.350877192982456
1388360,4,B0000520HM,"I have quite a few Kathy Smith videos and decided to give the Timesaver Shaper Ball Workout a try.  What fun!  Kathy knows how to talk you through every exercise move so you don't feel confused.  The day after I used the Shaper Ball Workout, my thighs were sore, but in a good way.  I'm pretty much a beginner since I'm not consistent with exercise.  With this video, I've easily added it into a daily routine.  Yeah, even after a long day at work and two teenagers to raise!  I recommend this video to anyone who's looking to start an exercise program or just want to add some variety to their existing routine.  As Kathy points out in her video, you can make the exercises more difficult just by how you position yourself on the ball and by adding more repetitions.",1029888000,12,767,4.390070921985815

7929744,4,B0000520HM,"This is a great workout if you're looking for more variety in your workout routines. I rotate her Yoga, Ball and Pilates workouts throughout the week. I looked up how many calories you burn with the different types of workouts and the ball routine actually burns double the calories than a regular routine. Most likely because you're using your core the entire time you're working out.

I highly recommend Kathy Smith videos for beginners because she explains how to do all of the moves with correct form. Plus she explains how to do the exercises as a beginner, intermediate and advanced. There are some that I do as a beginner and some as advanced. So you can tailor make it for your fitness needs.",1318464000,,700,4.645161290322581
7929745,1,B0000520HM,"I really feel that I just wasted both my time and money with this DVD.  The workout is so easy.  Please, do not buy this DVD if you are alreay in decent shape.  I have been doing pilates for several years and wanted to try something similar, but new and challenging.  I really like, but struggle with Kathy Smith's 20-minute BONUS stability ball workout in her Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2 DVD, and thought this would be similar.  Boy was I wrong.

7929746,1,B0000520HM,"I like other Kathy Smith's videos, but this balance ball workout is terrible... it's a joke!  A bad joke.  It's even funny to see Kathy's ball is too small for her!!!  The routine is extremely boring and the guy in the video is mostly ignored by Kathy.  I feel bad for him.  Whenever he says anything she seems uncomfortable and just keep going without paying attention to him at all.  And as he is shorter than her they look so funny.  This really seems a sketch of a bad comedy or something.  There are plenty of much better balance ball workouts out there.  I only paid $.85 cents for this one but wish I would have bought a Kit-Kat instead.  What a shame.",1218240000,,659,4.284552845528455
7929747,3,B0000520HM,"Since this is Kathy Smith, you can be sure that it is well-researched, safe, and clear. In fact, for learning the correct form for stability ball workouts, it is hard to beat.

However, it is a training session, not a workout. Unless you are very new to this form of workout, you will not feel that you have done much work. Your heartrate will not rise. You will not look forward to those slightly sore muscles the next day. And there is a great deal of talking and no music, so you certainly will not experience that ""flow"" enjoyment of the workout.

There are lots of good moves, though, for abs and back in particular. There are some nice stretches,and several exercises I hadn't encountered in classes or other workout DVDs.

I would say this is ideal for getting to know the stability ball and learning how to adapt moves for different levels of difficulty.

Once you've gone through it, though, go to a class or try Lizbeth Garcia's On the Ball Pilates workout instead.",1173139200,,975,4.554285714285714
7929748,2,B0000520HM,"The workout says it has a running time of 30 minutes, but is really about 20 minutes when you cut out all the unnecessary talking. Between exercises, I found myself sitting around waiting for instruction on the next move.  It seemed like Kathy and her really awkward work out partner just kept going on and on about how great this exercise ball was. I don't want to hear all about the ball during a workout, I want to use it, save it for the introduction.  The whole workout is choppy, disjointed and not so great.",1154995200,,514,4.4
7929749,1,B0000520HM,"A slow moving tape with so much talk that you can hardly stand it especially after the second or third time around.  This tape is going to Goodwill.  I hope they don't mark it too high.

THEN there is Mikey!  It's an embarrassment to watch he and Kathy flirting like Junior High kids.  What was Kathy Smith thinking?  Didn't she watch this sad act before putting it on the market?",1141257600,3,380,4.357142857142857
