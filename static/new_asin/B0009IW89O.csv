2293194,4,B0009IW89O,"How does one convey the experience of war? Other than putting one in battle, it's difficult. This series does quite well in its short segments. And that is my biggest complaint - that each battle coverage is too short. Yet given their time constraints, they do an excellent job. The weakest point is that some of their modern explorations of the past equipment and experiences are a bit superficial - the tacking against the wind, for instance. But these are only a small proportion of the total time spent. My biggest wish is that each segment had been twice as long. It's very good stuff!",1163116800,3,590,4.628571428571429
2293195,4,B0009IW89O,"I first saw this series on SBS in Australia. Alas, it was not available in our region so I had to go international to get the DVD.

It's a rollickingly good documentary about warfare fought on British battlefields with commentary from a wise old sage, Dan Snow and his son. I preferred the analysis of Dan Snow rather than his son's comments about the 'human perspective' of war.

The best parts are the computer simulations that occur on a portable battlefield Dan Snow brings with him to the actual battlesite. Really brings the tactics of moving army formations to life.

Great DVD.",1153008000,,585,4.715686274509804
2293196,5,B0009IW89O,"I had seen snippets of this series on PBS but not the entire set of programs.  It is wonderful from many points of view...educational, historical, tactical, and cultural.",1138665600,,170,5.071428571428571
2293197,5,B0009IW89O,"This is an unapologetic rave review. Father and son Peter and Daniel Snow take the viewer on a high-tech and fast paced tour of UK battlefields, from Roman times to the Blitz. The battles covered are known to most casual historians and well known to military historians. They demonstrate what happened at pivotal moments of British history using reenactments, computer generated graphics of the battles and most entertaining, modern day reenactments of some of the hardships endured by the participants, such as carrying a pike (Naseby)or slogging through the heather at night with and without a compass, (Culloden). Live reenactments are interspersed with the graphics to give a feel of the flow of each battle. The slick 'battle board' technique of opening a folio to reveal the half-mile high view of the battlefield, zooming in to see details of movement of the tiny, accurately uniformed and equipped combatants, will give all wargamers an envy of the future. Least effective are the computer generated recreations of the faces of the commanders. Good portraits or even reenactors would have been better. The palpable excitement of the Snows for their subject should transmit enthusiasm to even a casual viewer. I find myself re-watching the battles and enjoying them as much each time. A great way to present history. We can hope for sequels from this team.",1138665600,16,1363,5.116591928251121
2293198,4,B0009IW89O,"Battlefield Britain presents 8 famous British battles in an exciting and engaging way. Each episode jumps quickly among several presentation styles:
  1) Narration - father and son Peter and Dan Snow narrate while walking or flying over the battle field. Their writing is interesting and they speak in an engaging manner.
  2) Computer battle simulation - Much like the ""Decisive Battle"" series which used the ""Rome: Total War"" computer game engine to simulate many fighters, ""Battlefield Britain"" uses computer simulation to recreate the battle formations, movements, and tactical decisions. The simulations are great at giving a general's eye view of the battle and the carnage.
  3) Historical reenactment - Live reenactors provide the up close shots with good views of weapons, equipment, and the ""you are there"" perspectives.
  4) Technical reenactment - Many scenes show the firing of real bows, guns, or cannons or sailing of real ships in an effort to show tactics or advantages of one side or the other.
  5) Dramatic reenactment - Actors in period costumes and makeup say why their side won or lost.
  6) Technical illustration - using computer maps or computer renderings of the leaders, the show provides these models for further historical explanations.

Of all these techniques, I enjoy the writing and speaking of Peter and Dan Snow the best. They make good professors and are passionate about their subject matter (although not quite as interesting and artistic as Simon Schama in ""A History of Britain"". Simon Schama has a theatric way of rendering history.) The computer battles are interesting to watch, and they really lay out the battles quite well. Peter's ""magic map board"" is a great technique for overlaying computer map scenes while he points and talks to various sections of the battle. Most of the other presentation styles serve as good interesting backdrops to these history lectures. Finally, the battle selection is great. I'm sure most people know Boudicca, Hastings, or the Spanish Armada, but the Llywelyn the Great and the Boyne are less well known battles, but every bit as interesting.

On the other hand, some of the computer generated sequences are used over-repetatively. And the dramatic reenactors seem to be saying the same things while adding little to the story: ""Well we really crushed those losers,"" or ""We were slaughtered. They just kept coming."" The computer generated heads of the generals looks somewhat hokey - I'm sure they will look quite dated in 10 years.

So, despite some shortcomings, overall a very good program that bears repeated viewing.",1133308800,22,2602,5.147268408551069
2293199,5,B0009IW89O,"This series blows the dust off of the history books!  In short, exciting ""lessons"" one can learn more about the history of Great Britain than sitting in most class rooms. (Or trying to make sense of it on your own.)  Very concise and entertaining.  Even if your not a history buff, you'll enjoy this.  Good for all ages.",1124755200,8,320,4.4655172413793105

2293203,5,B0009IW89O,Saw this on PBS.  An excellent way to portray historical battles.  Great combination of computer graphics and reenactments.  I highly recommend it.,1114646400,9,147,5.590909090909091
2293204,5,B0009IW89O,"These DVDs are wonderful way learn about history in a way that is truly informative and entertaining. Sometime one does not want to go through a lengthy and dry history book, so DVDs are nice if done in a  scholarly manner.",1364774400,,223,4.439024390243903
2293205,5,B0009IW89O,"Ok let me say i love Petter Snow & Dan Snow these two do i good job on this series
and explane very good on this, show i love how petter opens a map and shows how the battle happens on the CGI map
and Dan explans things very clearly

this series is just as good as 20th Century Battleflieds

so pick this one up its very cool to watch",1356825600,,334,3.757142857142857
2293206,5,B0009IW89O,This series give great in-depth explanations of 8 critical battles taking place on or near the UK.  The hosts illustrate these with computer graphics and personally trying tactics and weapons.  There are also actors playing period participants.  Each episode focuses on one battle.  The 8 episodes start with Boudica's revolt against the Romans and end with the Battle of Britain in WWII.,1355097600,,388,5.209677419354839
2293207,5,B0009IW89O,"Battlefield Britain is fabulous. Peter and Dan Snow make these topics very interesting and personable. Yes, the ""real-life"" interviews of actors portraying participants in battles is a little cheesy, but I'll let it slide. If you're interested in British warfare and history this set is excellent.",1345593600,,297,5.478260869565218
2293208,4,B0009IW89O,"We loved this show when we first saw it on PBS and had been thinking about buying the DVD. Eventually we did, and it's a fine transfer of the show. We haven't watched any of the bonus features yet, just making our way through the episodes again. What makes this show unique is the combination of live re-enactors, computer generated reenactments, and the two presenters going live to the actual battlefields and doing some simulations of the technology of the time. The father/son team do a great job presenting the show in a fun but informative manner, and it's kind of fun seeing the dad taking advantage of his son sometimes, making him do the dirty work. Apparently the son didn't want to work with his dad originally, and you can see some of that in their interactions sometimes. Recommended if you're interested in British history, or history presented in a new, fun and interesting way.",1308096000,,893,4.730769230769231
2293209,5,B0009IW89O,"I'm a history nut.  Actually, I'm a British history nut.  I travel to the UK and dive into the countryside hoping to steep myself in their rich culture and history.

Battlefields and military strategy aren't typically my thing but can I just say ""oh my God!""... How very lucky I was to stumble upon this series.  It is enthralling. The graphic enhancements are amazing. The re-enactments by the actors pull me in and the blow-by-blow commentary by Peter and Dan just leave me ""gobsmacked.""

I heard about Boudicca for the first time through this series and on my next UK trip will try to visit some of the places related to her story.

Thank you, thank you for this amazing series!

Now, if the BBC would just put ""A Picture of Britain"" into Region 1 format. *sigh* I can only watch it on my PC.",1296777600,,795,4.441379310344828

2293211,5,B0009IW89O,"This is possibly the most informative and interesting tv series that I have ever seen.  The personalities are not only extremely knowledgable but they are also intensely passionate about the subject and are able to convey their interest and knowledge to the viewer.

The battles of Britain are described in vivid detail and with the aid of the CGI effects, one can get a great understanding of just how and why the battles unfolded the way they did.

I am enthusiastic about their new series, 20th Century Battlefields and am hopeful that this father son duo will produce many more such series in the years to come.

Bravo Peter and Dan Snow!",1199318400,2,642,4.705357142857143
2293212,5,B0009IW89O,"A great series for any world history teacher.  I like the fact that it has multiple was of displaying the battlefield as well as giving background information of the battles.  I plan on using a clip of the series for one of my lesson plans.

A good series!",1168819200,2,256,4.291666666666667
2293213,4,B0009IW89O,"I am an amature military historian. I have long experience in wargaming with miniatures, and recent experience ""on the field"" in my 11th century AD ""kit"", reenacting the battle of Hastings. So when my friend loaned me his copy of Battlefield Britain, I had come fresh from the battlefield myself. Seeing reenactors snarling and screaming (""in extremis"") made my recent experiences seem all the more like having participated in the making of an epic movie. The reenactor spots in the eight battles naturally caught my attention and greatest interest. The CGI armies only less so, because I could see that the animation is not big budget calibre: but looking at the CGI battle scenes as though they are animated wargames armies worked for me. I especially enjoyed the ""magic map"" case of Peter Snow, which shows the armies moving across the immediate terrain into contact.

Aside from the graphics, the content is good (mostly accurate) history and easily understood, because the writing and speaking is so clearly rendered. This is a very crisp history course. It moves. Seen one after another, there is some repetition in the delivery, but I liked it better when I watched only one or two at a time and ""chewed"" on what I had just been shown.",1163203200,3,1242,4.8584905660377355

8061363,5,B0009IW89O,"Father and son historians Peter and Daniel Snow take you on a tour of the most important or famous battles in Britain's history. In eight roughly hour-long segments, the pair walk the viewer through battles that took place in the British isles from ancient times to modern.

These are the eight battles chosen by the pair: Boudicca's war, Hastings, Norman-Welsh wars, Spanish Armada, Naseby, The Boyne, Culloden and the Battle of Britain. These are battles that are of import to Britain, not the world, so there are a couple no one outside Britain has a great deal of familiarity with.

In the rebellion of the Iceni tribe led by queen Boudicca, Celtic tribesmen are pitted against veteran Roman legions. Hastings features the Anglo-Saxon's of Harold Godwinson defending against the invasion of William the Bastard's Normans and allied contingents. The Normans once again serve as an antagonist in the conquest of Wales. Most people have heard of the ""Spanish Armada"", but most non-UK viewers will not have heard of the Battle of Naseby which was the decisive battle during the English Civil War when Parliament defeated and ousted a king or the Battle of the Boyne which took place in Ireland where the ousted James II tries to regain the throne of Britain from William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant king invited to rule England by Parliament.

More people have heard of Culloden where ""Bonnie Prince Charlie"", or Charles Stuart, and his Highland Scots tried to retake England even as his predecessor James II had done earlier at the Boyne - a battle which saw the end of Stuart claimants to the throne and the end of the Highland way of life. Of course, everyone has heard of the Battle of Britain when ""the few"", the fighter pilots and RAF Fighter Command defeated the Luftwaffe in 1940.

Each of the segments has Peter and Daniel Snow lay the groundwork with the history of the lead-up to each battle, the weapons involved, the leaders of both sides as they go to the modern place where the battle occurred and show the lay of the land. There are very good re-enactments with men in period dress and weaponry as well as CGI recreations of the battle from a bird's eye view high above. They do a very good job of showing the course of the battles as well as showing how and when the decisive moment in each conflict happened. They also cover the aftermath and the significance of the battle in the history of Britain.

This is essentially eight very good hours of battle commentary. Those interested in military history will enjoy these productions and I think they are well-made and presented entertainingly by the father-son pair who always seem to work in a little humor. I recommend this DVD set to those interested with five stars.",1414713600,3,2739,4.757894736842105
8061364,5,B0009IW89O,I bought this DVD set from Amazon. What a great DVD at a super low price. This father and son team are great. If you love English history. you will love this DVD. This shows you the history of famous English battles like you have never seen before. They go the the actual place of the battle. You cannot go wrong getting this set of 3 DVDs. And the price is a bargain.,1411430400,,368,4.054794520547945
8061365,5,B0009IW89O,My wife and I saw this program originally on PBS and liked it then.  We decided to get the DVD for our library.  The Snows do a very good job of presenting some of the major battles fought in Great Britain.  The episodes are a once-over-lightly view of the lead up to the battle and the battle itself.  We find the Osprey books very helpful in more details on the battles.  We wished that the Snows would do a similar overview of Wellington's Peninsular Campaign ahead of the bicentennial (the campaign culminated in 1814).  They might want to take a crack at the American battlefields as we've not seen anything comparable from the States.,1411171200,,640,4.5701754385964914
