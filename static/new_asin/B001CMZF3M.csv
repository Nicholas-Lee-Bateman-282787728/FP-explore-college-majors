3514311,1,B001CMZF3M,"The most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in this kind of video, but it only actually runs about 20 minutes and some of that is repeated. It does have a looping feature, but if I would have known it was this short, I would not have purchased it. weak music, tinny piano that gets too loud. But really, Really, pretty video. I would have been happy to pay more, for a longer video of the same quality. Next time they need to wait to publish until they have a compleled video.",1259193600,10,475,4.173913043478261
3514312,5,B001CMZF3M,"This is a great way to bring that WINTER WONDERLAND feeling to your home--especially if you are in a warm weather climate during the Holidays!
I live in the north and still put it on....Just a great background for parties or just hanging round the house. Beautiful, serene pictures and
music to go with them.

AWESOME!!",1258156800,15,319,4.696428571428571
3514313,5,B001CMZF3M,This is a lovely video encompassing the Currier & Ives vision of the Christmas season.,1231632000,14,86,4.8
8288243,4,B001CMZF3M,Used to use the VHS version. Looooong time ago. Nice to play on xmas morning when opening gifts or during holiday  dinner. The quality on this is not that great. But can get it in any other format.,1491177600,2,197,4.184210526315789
8288244,5,B001CMZF3M,Good movie.,1399507200,,11,5.0
8288245,5,B001CMZF3M,I ordered a series of christmas dvd's from Amazon and have used each and every one during entertaining guest and just for my own enjoyment.  I love each and every one of them.  Amazon is my go too for this item.,1363910400,,211,4.121951219512195
8288246,5,B001CMZF3M,"I picked this up at my local Kmart recently and am very glad I did.  I loved everything about it, the music, all of the beautiful images.  I loved it so much that I actually didn't care that it wasn't widescreen format.  Trust me, you will love this!",1354406400,,250,4.166666666666667
8288247,5,B001CMZF3M,"This DVD reminds me of home back in Illinois.  It has beautiful pictures and music to go along with the breathtaking winter scenes. This is not done with still pictures which is why this is one of my favorite winter DVDs to play.
It is a video of a sleigh ride, snow falling, creek flowing etc. It is like you are there.
I have purchased a few of them and gave as Christmas gifts.",1333929600,3,380,4.135135135135135
8288248,1,B001CMZF3M,Cover shows a CHRISTMAS tree bit the title does not tell me what HOLY day they are worshipping. I need the title to be a bit more than POLICTICAL correct,1320537600,,153,4.133333333333334
8288249,4,B001CMZF3M,"The photography is quite simply some of the very best that I've seen.  No stock pictures or still photography are used.  I would rate the visuals at 5 stars.  The soundtrack, however, sounds very tinny and electronic (I would rate one star for the soundtrack).  I find it much more enjoyable to watch the dvd with the sound turned off while playing some of my favorite Christmas cd's. The show is very short but the viewer has the option of ""play one time"" or ""continuous play"".  All in all, I'd recommend this disc as being well worth the purchase price.",1298505600,,555,4.51
8288250,2,B001CMZF3M,"This was just okay. Wasn't crazy about the music they chose but the scenery was great, only about 30 minutes though.",1293840000,2,116,4.571428571428571
8288251,5,B001CMZF3M,I purchased this for the last winter season (2009) and really enjoyed it.  It is not long and it is not something you just have to stare at.  I mainly put it on the laptop and just let it go in the background.  I am generally up by 5AM and it was a nice peaceful respite before hearing all of the dreadful news of the day.  Even if you are not a follower of Christmas I think you would enjoy it.  We are having such dreadful heat here in New Jersey that I am about ready to put it on and pretend that it is November.,1280275200,8,516,3.830188679245283
8288252,1,B001CMZF3M,I would have wanted to know if this was a christmasmovie. It is not and so it happened to be a dvd which I never will play again.,1278806400,2,129,3.642857142857143
