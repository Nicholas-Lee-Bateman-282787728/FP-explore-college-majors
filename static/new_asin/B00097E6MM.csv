2269153,4,B00097E6MM,"This is a beneficial movie about what might face a Middle Easterner who chooses to follow Christ in his or her home country.  But be ready for hip '80s hairdos and some slightly artificial acting from the ""Westerners"".  Once you get into the main plot, the acting and scenes are well done.  You can tell it's low budget, but hey, they did a good job with what they had.  Where's the challenge in making a movie when you have $300 million?  All in all a good flick that points the honor to Christ where it belongs.",1254441600,3,513,4.302083333333333
2269154,5,B00097E6MM,"""Behind the Sun"" presents the story of Sameer, an American educated young Middle Eastern man going home to pay a visit to his family in an unnamed Arab country.  What he doesn't initially tell them (but they soon find out) is that Sameer has converted to Christianity and thus commited one of the worst offenses in Islam (apostacy).  Needless to say attitudes quickly change and Sameer becomes an outcast.  The short film illustrates the discrimmination and persecution including family violence that many Christians (and especially Christian converts) face in numerous Islamic nations.  A sidestory in the film (which becomes quite important) deals with a Middle Eastern pastor who smuggles bibles while avoiding the secret police and who desperately wants to get word out to the outside world of a Christian pastor who will otherwise be executed.  While I believe this is set in an Arab nation I have a feeling this aspect of the film was influenced by the case of an imprisoned Iranian pastor named Dibaj in the early 1990s.  One positive aspect of the film in my view is that the actors portraying Middle Easterners generally look Middle Eastern (and I am pretty certain some definantly had heritage in the region).  The film also features generally good acting and suspense; therefore it doesn't just tell an important story but is a very watchable film as well.  The cinematography is okay but not great and I wish the movie was longer to go into more depth.  However, I think the film's positive qualities vastly outweigh the negative.  From what I've read dealing with Christian persecution in the Middle East, the film is quite accurate and deals as well with the honor-shame aspect of society so prevelant in the Arab world.  The charity organization Open Doors which helps persecuted Christians apparently was responsible for the film which may account for the accuracy and plausibility of the situations depicted.

Overall a very good and moving film that I highly recommend.  It can help make one appreciate the degree of religious freedom in the United States.",1250553600,5,2074,4.994186046511628
2269155,5,B00097E6MM,The hero in this movie shows great courage and faith as he travels to the Middle East to try to convert his Muslim family to Christianity.  I especially recommend this for young people.,1245974400,,185,4.606060606060606
2269156,5,B00097E6MM,"I purchased this dvd after it was recommended to me.  I have watched it twice and would again.  If you want to see what Muslims, who turn from Islam to accept Christ as their Savior, face this is a must see dvd. It is fiction but I believe factual in what really happens.  I, as a Christian, know so little of paying a price because of my faith.  This story is very humbling.",1242432000,4,375,4.095890410958904
2269157,5,B00097E6MM,"""Behind the Sun"" is a powerful film about a young Muslim who converts to Christianity.  It traces the real danger that he faces when his family finds out, and the steps leading to a life devoted to the people whom he loves.
For orthodox believers, be aware that the gospel is given only tangentially and a nod is given toward churches around the world that may or may not be true unadulterated evangelists of Christ's salvation.  In the proper context, however, these are easily addressed if needed.
The acting, music, and filming are very good for a low-budget film.  There is nothing to be ashamed of here when using this as a tool for ministry.",1233878400,5,647,4.608695652173913
2269158,5,B00097E6MM,"We enjoyed this movie so much.  It challenges you to not be afraid to live for Jesus and reminds you of what others sacrifice every day in our current time.  Teenagers and young adults also enjoy this film.  It makes people consider if they are living out what they say they believe, and if they are really willing to suffer the consequences if people reject them for their faith in Jesus.",1220572800,4,389,4.450704225352113
2269159,5,B00097E6MM,"This movie was far more than I expected. It is very well produced in every way. I'm still amazed that I hadn't heard of it until recently and only came across it when browsing a printed catalog. But the reason I'm submitting a review is to say that this production is truly impactful. It has penetrated my heart and thoughts and affected my actions. Clearly, this movie was orchestrated by Father Himself for those on the narrow path and those looking for the straight way.",1165622400,26,473,4.576470588235294
2269160,5,B00097E6MM,"""Behind the sun"" is where Samir's family threatens to send him if he doesn't renounce Christianity.  Samir has a career and a girlfriend in the US, but has traveled back to the Middle East to visit his family and share with them the good news of Jesus.  Things don't go as exactly planned, and the movie recounts the persecution not just of Samir, but of the local underground church comprised of Christians from an Islamic background.  It's significant that the film distinguished between the above-ground, tolerated church comprised of historically Christian Arabs sort of ""grandfathered into"" Christianity and so tolerated, versus the underground church consisting of converts from Islam.

Though BEHIND THE SUN is a rather simple story, I'm rating it highly because of its importance as a reminder to not forget our suffering brothers, plus the story, uncomplicated though it is, is of high quality in presentation.  Also, all Christians should be able to relate to the protagonist's experience on some level, anyway, since the Bible promises persecution to all who live godly in Christ Jesus.  4.5 stars",1163808000,27,1108,5.162011173184357
2269161,5,B00097E6MM,"In this movie, a Muslim, Samir, from an unnamed Islamic country attends university in Chicago.  While there, he come into contact with some Christian students, and from the testimony of their life, he converts to Christianity.  When he returns to his country, he has to face all the Islamic consequences for Muslims who become Christians (or any other religion).  Samir's father, rather than kill him, disowns him; however, his uncles are out to kidnap him for forced 'reconversion' to Islam; if he then refuses, the plan to kill him.

At the same time, a Christian pastor in his country is imprisoned and it is a foregone conclusion that his trial will result in his martyrdom.  Other Christians in the country, through smuggling means with a Frenchman, are bringing Bibles and taking developments of the pastor's situation out for news sources in the West.  Samir, with no place to stay and no money finds the secret Christian group, and after a period of mistrust of him (thinking he is a secret police spy), let him join the group.  With his life in grave danger, Samir also sees the great need of the Christians in his country, so, when it comes time for him to return to Chicago, he has a difficult decision to make.

This movie may be distributed by the Christiano Film Group, but it is produced by Open Doors, International, and is far, far above the quality of the Christiano produced movies.  Not only is it a much more professional quality, it doesn't beat you over the head with ""Christianity"" like the Christiano movies do.  In this movie, the drama is paramount; it lets the Christian message come through simply by the example of the lives of the Christian characters.  Indeed, it also shows a Muslim cousin of Samir risking his life to help his cousin.

If you are looking for a movie that will cause you to tense up from the danger to the main character, one that shows the risks of Christians in an Islamic country, and one that subtly gets its Christian message across without offending, then you will really like this movie.  In my opinion, this movie is as good or better than the best of the Billy Graham organization's movies.",1158796800,61,2149,4.683510638297872
2269164,4,B00097E6MM,We love this movie.  It is well done and has a great story line.  Being a Christian movie there is nothing objectionable to us.,1402617600,,127,4.25
2269165,5,B00097E6MM,This dvd shows how persecuted Christians are in some countries. It helps others to be aware of the needs of these Christians so we can pray for them. It also shows the importance of living for the Lord no matter the cost.,1392249600,,221,4.285714285714286
2269166,5,B00097E6MM,"Following the story of Samir Majan, a young middle eastern young man, who came to America for schooling and ended up converting to Christianity from his family religion, Islam. When he returns to his home from Chicago, he finds his family, once they find out his ""betrayal"" of Islam, seeking his demise as they track him down, and Samir finds himself running for his life.
While this film is obviously lower budget, it wasn't cheap in any way, and was actually really well done for what they had to work with. The movie was very accurate, and had a fringe of suspense that will put you on the edge of your chair! The acting was easily believable - and it also has a great surprise ending.
Samir, as a character, is close enough to an American for us to relate to, but brings us into a completely different realm that challenges our way of thinking.
 Anyone looking for inspirational Christian films, this is one that will be a wholesome watch for the whole family!",1377043200,3,964,4.540229885057471
2269167,4,B00097E6MM,I was very deeply moved by this film's portrai of the trauma and sorrow experienced by those who convert from Islam to Christianity. I have watch the movie several times.,1357776000,2,170,4.7
2269168,5,B00097E6MM,This film accurately depicts how a zealous Muslim family would likely aim to kill a son who had converted to Christianity. The depiction of the pastor and his Arab-Christian underground church is extremely well done. My hope is that more American Christians will see this film as a way of truly appreciating the freedom of religion we enjoy in America.,1354147200,3,352,4.883333333333334
2269169,4,B00097E6MM,This was pretty well done. We used it along with a curriculum we used to teach about the persecuted church.,1353801600,,107,4.4
2269170,5,B00097E6MM,this movie showed the reality of persecution and would be nice to show to family and perhaps a group to raise awareness of suffering Christians,1316908800,,143,4.76
2269171,5,B00097E6MM,"This is wonderful! This film is about love and friendship in Christ. A muslim becomes a christian when he comes to America,. He returns and his family in another country who finds out that he is a christian and disowns him. But the Lord is in it all, and he becomes a part of saving a friend! After he sees that the Lord wanted him to stay there, he denies his opportunity to go back to America. He stays in his home country to uphold the name of Christ in a muslim territory against all odds! Beautifully written and played. A wonderful picture of the sacrifice Christ made for his church! Loved it and you will too!! Enjoy!",1298678400,2,625,4.305084745762712
2269172,5,B00097E6MM,Very inspiring. We should apreciate more our gift of practice the religion of our choice. I do not know how many of us will have the courage this young man had.

8057936,5,B00097E6MM,"Brilliantly portrayed. From the researching of these two religions, I have realized how severe the punishment is regarding Muslims converting to Christianity. The outstanding acting drove my emotions to an even deeper understanding of the clashes between the two. Recommend!",1526688000,,274,5.875
8057937,4,B00097E6MM,This short movie drives home the point of sacrifice for what you believe.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is struggling with living their faith.  As you watch it think of the countless Christians in countries where they face persecution for their belief in Christ.  We in this country take it for granted that we can live our faith without persecution but as we let more and more radical groups in that may well change.,1510444800,,432,4.584415584415584
8057938,1,B00097E6MM,"Ridiculous potrayal of Muslims in the Middle East who have lived with Christians, Jews, and other religions for centuries.  Sixty years in and out of Middle East I never encountered such bias because of my religion.  As three Muslim men said to me years ago along the Nile when I told them I was Christian, ""Oh, good!  We all go through different doors to get to the same God""

If fake news is what you are after, this is it.  This is an embarrassment to Christianity, not Islam.",1507852800,2,479,4.3977272727272725
