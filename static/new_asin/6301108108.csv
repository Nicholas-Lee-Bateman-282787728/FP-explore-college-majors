313258,4,6301108108,"this 1988 gore film (i can't call it anything else since it's not a horror film in the classic sense) features an ensemble of Treat Williams {most notably from the ""Substitute"" series of movies} and comedian Joe Piscopo, known for his years on Saturday Night Live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of Frank Sinatra and David Letterman among others. The two play cops, Williams is Roger and Joe is his partner, Doug. the back of the VHS gives a detailed description of the film, plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie. Lindsay Frost plays the stereotypical ""innocent"" woman caught up in everything that's going on around her...but the corpse of the situation deals with Roger getting shot and coming back to life. he must solve a case within so many hours or he'll turn into ashes...and as the hours progress, naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally. Darren McGavin plays the part of an evil doctor. Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but ""Dead Heat"" IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor.",1079222400,3,1854,4.587349397590361
313259,5,6301108108,"This is the story of two L.A. detectives Roger Mortis ( Treat Williams) and Doug Bigelow ( Joe Piscopo) who are solving crimes caused by undead criminals caused by a mysterious medical company that has a machine that resurrects the dead into zombies. Roger unfotunately gets killed, but he gets brought back to life but only for 13 hours before he can decompose into dust, he must solve his own homicide and find the mastermind behind it.
A highly entertaining, gory and funny mixture of sci-fi, horror, action, buddy cop and comedy with great make-up and monster effects by Steve Johnson, Vincient Price and Darren Mcgavin ( A Christmas Story) co-star as the bad guys who own the medical company. There is also plenty of action, witty humor, a memorable Chinese butcher shop scene involving undead meat, gore, and a nice twist in the end. This DVD offers excellent picture and sound quality all thanks to Anchor Bay's Divamax, great extras such as deleted scenes ( Scenes that had to avoid the X rating when this movie came out in 1988), Commentary by the director and writer, Poster-and-still gallery, Original storyboard art, MIFED promo, Widescreen, theatrical trailer.
I recommend this movie to fans of zombie movies, action flicks and horror comedies.

I was very surprised to find this a rollicking cop ""buddy"" movie, with one of the cops becoming dead.. and reanimated. I loved the crossing of genres, cop action with horror/thriller. This movie does have some fun twists in it. And to see one of Vincent Price's last roles this is worth it. Why don't they make more of this cross genre?

Four or five months ago (early summer 2002) I was looking at some DVDs at a flea market and, lo and behold, there it was ... all brand new and shrink-wrapped. I think I paid a whole [$] for the DVD. It was marketed by some off-the-wall video company, but surprise, surprise, the picture and sound quality are VERY good. I think it looks as good as it did on cable. Well, the movie is still not a classic or anything, but it probably is developing a following of sorts since it is so hard to come by. Sorry, but I can't help you to find a copy of it.

Treat Williams is a cop who dies and yet he lives on and decomposes throughout the film.  Piscipoe is not funny normally - this is the only time you'll ever see him being funny.  The film was not well received and I think it has somewhat of a cult following since only a handful of people actually liked it.  Haven't seen it in ages so I don't know how well it would hold up.  I remember it being really cool though.  This is what 80's movies were all about... being really terrible with cheesey special effects, but entertaining as all hell.

Thanks to Image Entertainment for bringing Dead Heat to Blu-ray. Is the Blu-ray picture & sound perfect, the answer is no. The 1080p High Definition 1:78.1 Widescreen transfer is a mixed bag in terms of quality. While viewing this Blu-ray, I had to remember that Dead Heat wasn't a Hollywood blockbuster in terms of budget or special effects.

There is some considerable print damage during the opening and closing credits in the form of dust particles or speckling. I also noticed a slight picture wobble here and there but not enough to ruin my viewing experience. The video image is clear but quite grainy and a bit noisy at times. Black levels are slightly inconsistent throughout the film. Colors seemed a bit soft but every once in a while youd get an occasional pop of color here and there, especially the reds. The best way to gauge the picture quality is to watch the rough looking trailer and then play the film. There is quite a noticeable difference. Unless this film undergoes a complete restoration, this is probably the best it will ever look.

Audio quality 3.0/5
Dead Heat comes to Blu-ray with an uncompressed PCM 2.0 soundtrack that carries the dialogue clearly throughout the film. In terms of overall sound quality its very disappointing and kind of a lackluster soundtrack. The film contains some good shootouts and explosions but the sound doesnt really bring them to life. Given the low budget in terms of picture and sound quality, Im just happy to have Dead Heat on Blu-ray.

Special Features 1/5
There aren't any special features and thats really disappointing. You get three VHS looking film previews and a very rough looking trailer for Dead Heat, thats it. Id like to think that there would have been bloopers, gag reels, outtakes or interviews of some kind made during the filming. Its Joe Piscopo, Treat Williams, the incredible Vincent Price and Darren McGavin were talking about. Joe Piscopo was hilarious back in the day and I find it hard to believe he didn't pull off some pranks during filming.

Being a cop for a living can sometimes have deadly consequences and Roger Mortis and Doug Bigelow are about to find that out, the hard way. It appears that a doctor has learned how to re-animate the dead and now he is sending out his re-animated corpses on crime sprees throughout the city. Standing in the way of the newly re-animated crooks are officers Mortis and Bigelow. Mortis is killed during an investigation at the lab but thanks to his partner, he gets brought back to life from the Resurrection machine. How do you fight a dead corpse? The answer is simple, with the newly re-animated cop duo of Mortis & Bigelow. Welcome to Dead Heat!

313451,4,6301108108,"Two L.A. cops get mixed up in a bloody battle with the living dead when one of them becomes a zombie dead set on finding his murderer before he decomposes entirely. Joe Piscopo plays wisecracking Detective Doug Bigelow and Treat Williams is his partner, Detective Roger Mortis, the just slightly more straight laced of the two; that is, until he dies on duty, only to be resuscitated by his friends in the reanimating machine they'd just discovered. Together, Doug and undead Roger leave a trail of corpses, some still walking, as they pursue the mystery of who is bringing local thugs back to life.

From 1988, ""Dead Heat"" is a bizarre and cheesy horror comedy spoofing typical buddy-cop action films of the day while still being a pretty legit one in its own right, at least in the realm of buddy-cop-zombie flicks. There's plenty of cool effects and gore throughout, and lots of jokes too, of varying effectiveness. The film is not without a heart though, and it has its introspective moments on life and death too. Plus, Vincent Price and Darren McGavin, so you know it's worth watching! The DVD from Anchor Bay has plenty of great extras: deleted scenes, trailer, galleries, promo, a behind the scenes featurette from back in the day, and even a DVD-ROM screenplay. Plus, you get a commentary with the director, producers, and writer. A commentary with the stars might have been a hoot, but the included one is very insightful! It's a really nice presentation for a film like this that wasn't really a hit when it came out (in fact, it was a flop), but which seems to have developed a following since then. Definitely a fun little action flick for those who enjoy stuff like Big Trouble in Little China, Robocop and They Live, not to mention stuff like Lethal Weapon and Turner and Hooch, ha.",1447718400,,1797,4.704761904761905
313452,5,6301108108,"Dead Heat is a true guilty pleasure of a horror film.
It shouldn't work but, it was made in 1988
It's a dirty indie film done way before the term ""Indie"" was even a sub genre  in films!

I watched this film very early when it hit VHS in 1989
It holds a very special place in my heart
The film is a strange horror-black comedy hybrid
That has plenty of over-the top 1980's action sequences mixed with pretty good low budget practical f/x

To break it down easy it's a buddy cop film with zombies!
Keep in mind by 1988 zombies were dead and buried short of speak  (mostly due to the desecration of zombies in all pop culture  selling Pepsi and dancing with Michael Jackson!
You'd think that would never happen again, oh wait it has gee thanks Walking Dead!!!!

The movie works mostly because of the great f/x and the actors
Treat Williams  (Roger Mortis)
Joe Piscopo  (Doug Bigelow)  looking jacked and a little to big for a comedian (this is pre Carrot Top bulking up to look bad!)
the two have great chemistry between them they play LA Cops

Darren McGavin  as Dr. Ernest McNab  (who's done everything from  Kolchak The Night Stalker to A Christmas Story) his performance alone is worth watching this film at least once he's so fun to watch!
Lindsay Frost as  Randi James  (she's very good in this and plays everything straight her death is something i always disliked mostly due to her character being used by her-so called father and paying the price)
Clare Kirkconnell  as Rebecca Smythers  (always liked her in this film  her work was very short)
Vincent Price  as Arthur P. Loudermilk (Price has a small role in this but, when he's in it he steals every scene he is in
he's character is very much build in the 1980's but, you can see lots of 1990's and beyond in the chemical make-up of Arthur P. Loudermilk reflects on lots of businessmen and there need to consume and take from everyone
There's a lot of very deep social commentary in this film you can easily miss if you put your brain outside the door
Interesting Cameos
Martha Quinn plays a Newscaster  (Quinn best known for being one of the  original MTV VJ's)
 Professor Toru Tanaka  as the Butcher  (Best known for Subzero in The Running Man and Francis's Butler in Pee-wee's Big Adventure)

The one thing you should know if you never seen Dead Heat and expect zombies like in Romero or Fulci films
This ain't that type of zombie film
It's smarter in the sense if someone found out how to cheat death they would capitalize on it
This is sleazy 1980's business men doing bad things to outlive everyone else
These zombies don't eat other people they are hidden in plain sight
Some are only brought back to life to do jewelry hist
and the big bad  ""Z"" word is used since they are undead nobody is calling them whatever hipster word is used to call zombies (Post TWD)

The Blu ray is by no means the special edition fans got with Anchor Bay's Divmax dvd years ago
Anchorbay/Starz couldn't do the right thing and give the extras to port onto a blu ray  so we get a passable HD print
with no extras  it's the best HD version to date and only....
The PCM 2.0 soundtrack is so/so a film like this with so much action deserves more of a boast in audio quality
If you already have the special edition dvd hold onto it for the extras (if you're a fan at least you'll want the dvd)

Maybe one day Scream Factory will get the rights and give horror fans the proper Collector's Edition of Dead Heat until then this will have to do
10x's better in PQ then Midnight Madness blu ray of Vamp that's for sure

Movie Review: I b!+(#ed about this before so here's the short version: Zombie movies SUCK D***! 100's of zombie movies and only 1% of them try something different with them while the rest is the whole survival bulls#!+!!! So naturally with this movie I struck gold. Dead Heat is a fast-paced, action/comedy/horror movie filled with action and satire. The comedy is more so charming than funny although I think some people will hate Joe Pisapoop's performance. I wasn't but, eh! The action is innovative and fun and story was good. La-de-da. I loved this movie because it is left-field and has a spontaneous feel to it and so forth. The end.

313589,3,6301108108,"In 1987, movie producers were thinking about how Lethal Weapon captured lightning in a bottle, and wanted to continue the trend one year later.  Their idea?  Lethal Weapon, but with zombies.  To do this, they hired Terry Black (Shane Black's brother - yes, Shane Black, who wrote...Lethal Weapon) and birthed Dead Heat.

Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo do their best impressions of Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs.  Heck, Treat Williams's straight laced character is even named Roger...Roger Mortis, to be exact (Roger Mortis...get it?).  Piscopo, who apparently showed up on set without an ounce of charisma, plays Doug, a Neanderthal police officer who never wears a shirt with sleeves and thinks only with his ding-dong and mullet.  The two have about as much chemistry as Wesley Snipes and a tax return, which is the biggest problem here.  Had two leads been cast with even just a dash of 'play-off-each-other-wit', this may have been a 'good' movie.  As it is, it's just so bad that it's become enjoyable.

Here's the plot...some old nutcase has created a 'resurrection machine' and has started bringing back the dead...which not only makes them basically indestructible for twelve hours (after which, they melt into dust).  While investigating (poorly), Roger Mortis is killed and resurrected, giving him a short time as an invincible zombie to catch the old jerk, while his meathead partner follows him while spouting stupid one liners like, ""You have the right to remain disgusting.""

The 'gore' effects are actually not that bad - take this broad turning into a fast forwarded corpse, which looks pretty good for 1988...up until the stupid skull starts talking at the end of the scene.

The best part of the movie involves our dumb duo heading to a Chinese butcher shop.  They confront the owner, who proceeds to flick on a light switch - the light above happens to (inexplicably) be a mini resurrection machine.  It starts bringing all of the dead, chopped up animals back to life - duck heads, livers, and pig carcasses all attack the cops (but not the Chinese men who chopped them up in the first place).  Describing this scene just does not do it justice.  It is one of the most bonkers/insane/crazy scenes I've ever seen in any movie.  A close second would be a scene in which Treat Williams and some bad guy shoot each other point blank with Uzis for what seems like forever.

You absolutely cannot go into this movie expecting anything other than insanity, and on that note, it does deliver.  The actual comedy bits in this movie are awful and completely miss, but you'll be laughing at the absurdity of it all.  It's on Netflix right now, I suggest you grab a six-pack and some friends while giving this a spin.",1395532800,,2727,4.834051724137931

313592,5,6301108108,"When I first saw it in 1988 it was interesting and got more so as the story progressed. First we see two criminals who invade a jewelry store to rob it in broad daylight. Armed with full auto Uzi's and hand grenades they take the loot then walk out the front door to meet  SWAT and local officers that erupt into quite the gun battle. How ever we see in the first seconds that the hoodlums keep on firing even after they are hit over and over. (They aren't wearing body armor.) In the mean time the toll is being taken on the LAPD as officer after officer falls from the deadly hail. It takes the maverick team of detectives Roger Mortis and Douglas Bigelow  to use unorthodox methods to take the unkillable twosome down. Roger is the button down detective and Doug is the leather jacket wearing muscle man with a quip for every case and a bullet for every dirt bag. While Roger takes their supervisors car to ram one of them flat, Roger steps out and shoots hitting the other's hand as he gets ready to throw a grenade, it falls at his feet and blows him up. When their coroner friend tells them that the two ""disgusting"" corpses have been there before, then things turn from strange to weird. It leads to a corporate conspiracy of resurrecting the dead and promises of immortality.

I must warn you it isn't a comedy though it is funny, to take the edge off the horror you do see. I liked the various characters we see but it does get solemn at times which is needed to put the edge back in the story and make it more real, as it goes from harsh to funny to horrible in the telling. At least one bit of footage cut out of the theatrical release and shown in the tv version has been put back in. Takes place at the Loudermilk (Vincent Price) tomb where Roger and Randi () meet a laconic security guard (the always excellent  ) Roger discovers a cryptic message left by the late billionaire Arthur P. Loudermilk that leads to the solving of the case. [Yes it is a who done it with echoes of ""D.O.A."" and an obscure film from 1932 called ""Six Hours To Live.""] Also nice to see Keye Luke in one of his last roles and the great Darrin McGavin as the ""Body Doc.""

The main thing was the idea that these ""zombies"" didn't shamble, didn't eat people and were well done with the makeup showing how far they have progressed in their time to be ""alive"" again. Other cut out scenes that enhance the narrative. Worth it if you like something different in your film library. Be sure to listen to the commentary track. A minor film but it does its job. Recommended.

Upon re watching the Blu Ray I can't imagine what I was thinking.  Sort of an interesting premise for a cheesy Sci Fi horror
comedy.  However, I can see now why Joe Piscopo never made it in movies.  In his defense the script was just a string of
bad one liners.  The director, Mark Goldblatt doesn't seem to have gone on to direct any other notable films.  The script
writer Terry Black has since done some work for television.  This film was one of Vincent Prices' last movies so I guess
that's notable.  The Blu Ray looked o.k. but with some issues, which when compared with the rest of the movie, doesn't
seem like an important factor.  Honestly, I cannot recommend this film.",1369872000,,803,4.306666666666667
313594,3,6301108108,"The April 16, 2011, review by David Baldwin beats me to the punch on much of what I have to say about the 1988 action-comedy-zombie film DEAD HEAT.  I post mainly to publicly wonder why co-star Joe Piscopo's film career derailed after this movie, which while a flop as I recall, was hardly the only title with well-known actors to receive bad reviews and be neglected by filmgoers in the history of cinema.  With his success as one of early 1980s stars of television's SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE under his belt, Piscopo acted in two fine mid-80s comedies, JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY and WISE GUYS.  Not keeping up that momentum, was DEAD HEAT that much of a career killer that since then Piscopo has had a role in only one movie I have even heard of, the 1992 Chuck Norris flick SIDE KICKS, at least according to the I.M.D.B. web site?  Piscopo is funny and charming in DEAD HEAT.  And, ready for his close-up, he communicates with the best of the buddy film actors in the scene where he watches partner cop Treat Williams drive away.

313598,5,6301108108,"PLOT :
Detectives Roger Mortis and Doug Bigelow  are walking, talking police partner stereotypes. Roger (Treat Williams) plays the straight man...all calm, cool, and collected. Doug (Joe Piscopo) is his wisecracking, loose cannon of a partner.
Called to a jewel heist in progress, Roger and Doug join the fracas as two thieves with Uzis (the movie has no shortage of these) unload on what appears to be the entire Los Angeles Police Department as they're exiting the store with the goods. Roger and Doug, along with the rest of the good guys unload back with a flurry of gunfire, only to see the thieves take a lickin' and keep on tickin'. How can these thieves survive such a barrage? That's the million-dollar question.
The thieves aren't dying because they're already dead! It looks like someone in town is resurrecting the criminal element and using the zombies to do their dirty work. It takes a grenade and a well-placed sedan to the midsection to finally dispatch the two undead evildoers, and detectives Mortis and Bigelow begin their investigation into just who might be behind this bizarre new crime wave.
When Roger bites the big one in a doggie euthanasia room while fighting a hefty undead two-faced biker and is resurrected shortly thereafter, it becomes a race against time as they try to find Roger's killer. Can Roger find his killer before his body decomposes and he turns into worm food? Can Doug keep from becoming a walking corpse himself?

DEAD HEAT is a classic 80s Midnight Movie. It mixes up some popular Genres of that Decade : the Buddy-Cop-Movie and the Zombie-Movie.
Perhaps the only time zombies, cops, and a generous dose of humour have been infused together on film. Dead Heat is a fun, Drive-In type feature.
Writer Terry Black(who is the brother of Shane Black who wrote Lethal Weapon) and director Mark Goldblatt grab the opportunity with both hands and they cheerfully combine all the clichd situations and stereotypes both genres have to offer.
The formular of this flick works damm well with his great Actors Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo.
They know how to make jokes to the point and even can satisfy the viewer in the Action Scenes. Some of the greatest one-liners in Horror Comedies I've ever heard came out of this film. So many scenes in this movie are priceless because of the utterly stupid humor!
You also will meet again with Vincent Price in one of his last Movies before he died(after DEAD HEAT he only did 5 other Movies in hi career).
 I am sure that makes it very interesting for all the fan of him to watch the movie, even when he doesnt have that big of a rolle.
Price is a delight; it's nice to see that he was still embracing the horror genre and working steadily late in his life and career.
The Special FX(done by Steve Johnson,who also did the FX in SPECIES) and also the Sets look great,they are done in a way that could only be done in the 80's!
Most memorable is a scene where a Chinese restaurant is resurrected... causing chicken, duck and cow carcasses to attack.
The Score from Ernest Troost may is not anything special or remarkable but it enhances the atmosphere and suspense in DEAD HEAT.
Seeing as 1988 was the same year that brought horror fans Chucky's debut film (CHILD'S PLAY) and the fourth installment of Freddy and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, I can see why DEAD HEAT was easily overlooked. Interestingly enough, the similarly titled buddy cop movie RED HEAT (with Schwarzenegger and Belushi) actually did well in theaters that year!
The other Problem DEAD HEAT was not that succesful and overlooked  would have been :
It's a horror comedy made at the end of the eighties. A time when horror was in trouble, the slashers were out of order, SF horrors were over, nothing really happened so it was a problem to bring out horrors.
The MPAA didn't like the effects used, to gory, so the movie was cut in his best parts.
So the gore was cut out, so it failed at the box offices and it also meant to be the end of the New World Pictures. On to VHS it was, here it became a bigger success and even went on to became a cult classic. Due the ending of NWP the film was never again released uncut.
Happy to see the release almost 15 years later made by Anchor Bay. The film is still cut but they were able to add in an extra feature the parts that were cut out!
DEAD HEAT is a light-headed and fairly engaging spitfire of gags and grotesque action sequences, and I have yet to meet someone who regrets watching it.
To sum it all up now :
DEAD HEAT is a great Mix of Action,Horror and Comedy that does not get boring over the whole running time and entertains you!
Sure you cannot expect any Award Winning Movie,but if you are a fan of this kind of movies you will not be disappointed.

313683,4,6301108108,"Well, I first saw this movie at a friend's house when I was about 14.  I was flipping channels & then came to stop on either HBO or Showtime (could've been Cinemax, I don't remember).  I watched one movie (I don't remember what it was), but then another came on; Dead Heat.  At first, I began thinking it was kind of a reverse rip off of Lethal Weapon, but I continued to watch.  The movie itself wasn't really that good, but I couldn't stop watching it.  As I continued to watch, I was filled with mixed feelings of interest & thinking that this was the worst movie I had ever seen.  But I couldn't stop watching & to this day I don't know why.  Anyway, the movie is about these two cops, who are apparently best friends but complete opposites.  Roger Mortis (played by Treat Williams) is as straight as an arrow when it comes to his job.  Always nicely dressed (even for the 80's), & willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done (like me).  His partner, I don't remember the character's name (played by Joe Piscapo), is a muscle-head, leather jacket wearing, wise-cracking fellow who doesn't try to put too much effort into his job, unless necessary (also like me).  Well, as a jewlery store is being robbed, the two get called to assist with the Situation.  On a side note, when they get to the store, they talk to a balding guy with a mustache.  If you've ever seen Star Trek: Voyager, he's ""The Doctor.""  Back on track, here.  The criminals they encounter seem to be impervious to gunfire as they shoot them...repeatedly.  It isn't until Roger ""borrows"" the mustache guy's car that one of the criminals gets taken down for good.  The other one gets blown up by a grenade.  Yeah, apparently, the LAPD were allowed to carry grenades back in the 80's.  Long story short, Roger ends up dying.  He gets suffocated in a vaccum room that's allegedly used to kill animals.  Conveniently, there's a machine that can bring folks back to life in the next room, so Piscopo's carachter & Mortis' Morge-chick girlfriend (I forgot to mention her, but it'll be alright) bring him ""back to life.""  Only problem is, he has 10 to 12 hours to solve the case of his own murder before basically melting into a mountain of puss because his cells are breaking down so rapidly or whatever.  It's not a great movie.  Heck, it isn't even a good movie, but it's a type of movie that can keep your attention (if, for no other reason than to see how much more ridiculous it gets).  I'm not saying that there's going to be a sex scene with clowns (there are no sex scenes), but it's an interesting mix of mystery, drama & comedy that you can never completely forget.  As I said, the first time I saw this movie, I was 14.  I'm 27, now.  For years, I couldn't remember the name of this movie, but always remembered the movie itself, so I can say from personal experience that this movie (either for good or for bad) will stay etched in your mind for years to come.  I'd recommend this film to anybody looking for a good laugh (or the writers of Mystery Science Theater 3000, if they ever try to bring that show back).",1308268800,,3097,4.403169014084507
313684,3,6301108108,"""Dead Heat"" has a promising premise that goes nowhere.  It's not a bad film by all means.  If you have 90 minutes to waste I can think of worse viewing fare.  The problem is that the film barely qualifies as a comedy and with few exceptions is hardly scary.  Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo try to inject life, no pun intended, to the enterprise but seem to be abandoned by the film's almost total lack of artistry.  There are few notable moments here.  A woman's decomposition scene as well as a scene in a Chinese restaurant where the killed animals come to life makes you sit on the edge of your seat.  Vincent Price also has a nice little cameo that neither cements or hinders his legend among film freaks.  This movie was unfairly trashed when it was released In the Eighties.

313688,4,6301108108,"There's a certain offbeat awesomeness to this 1988 hybrid movie which just compels me to pop it in the player every few years. DEAD HEAT baffles straightforward attempts at genre pigeonholing. There's a bit of that buddy cop LETHAL WEAPON flavor going on, a bit of D.O.A., and some A NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. And then it carries on with its own mad vibe. Joe Piscopo is Joe Piscopo, and that's not an endorsement. DEAD HEAT certainly won't win accolades in acting or screenplay or cinematography, but, damn, if there isn't something about it that keeps your eyes glued and keeps you wondering what kind of crazy is going to drop next.

Maverick LAPD detectives Roger Mortis (Treat Williams) and Doug Bigelow (Piscopo) look into a spate of armed robberies in the posh district, the twist being that these masked robbers prove to be really, really, really hard to kill. Because they're already dead. The investigation leads the detectives to a pharmaceutical firm where they get in a shoot-out with more really hard to kill weirdos (as Bigelow would later comment: ""Remember the good old days when guns killed people?""). When Roger Mortis becomes a casualty, he's revived by a resurrection device and comes back without a heartbeat but with a sort of invulnerability. He has ten to twelve hours before his corpse dissolves into organic goo, time enough, he hopes, to catch his murderer.

I haven't seen too much of Treat Williams's cinematic stuff, but I've seen DEEP RISING and DEAD HEAT plenty of times, and dude is terrific in these two movies. His performance bolsters DEAD HEAT's oddball premise, exuding as he does this essence of understated cool. His character Det. Roger Mortis has always demonstrated a sense of reckless bravado, but it's fun watching him let loose and show even more disregard for personal safety the more he accepts his zombie state. I guess there's a certain release that comes with gross skin deterioration and an assortment of gashes and gory bullet wounds. In the final half hour, zombie Detective Mortis can't seem to help but smile and smile.

No brains were eaten in the making of this movie, but there's still ample gross-out moments for ghoulish-minded sorts like me. The out-of-left-field sensibility, that twist of the surreal, is never more palpable than in the frenetic and kinda sick butcher shop sequence, in which slaughtered meat come to life and jump on our characters. Somewhere, Sam Raimi is giving a fist pump. DEAD HEAT makes a half-hearted effort at a romance with not one, but two, hotties (Lindsay Frost is smoking hot), but it's really more about the weirdness and the horror and the tongue-in-cheek stuff and the undead cop getting his vengeance on even as bits of him get sliced at, shot off, burnt up, or rotted off.

The most charitable thing I can say about Saturday Night Live alum Joe Piscopo is that, as the muscle-bound, dim-witted cop partner, he's less annoying in this one than in other things he's been in. Meanwhile, old horror vets Vincent Price and Darren McGavin lend the picture a kind of dubious prestige. And, to apply the Kevin Bacon game on DEAD HEAT and LETHAL WEAPON, not only did Terry Black - brother of LETHAL WEAPON writer Shane Black - write the screenplay to DEAD HEAT, but Shane Black himself makes a cameo appearance as a patrol cop in DEAD HEAT. His scene coincides with my favorite line in the movie. Right before Shane shows up, a severely scorched Roger Mortis unzips himself from a body bag and starts pulling burnt pieces of his face off, at which point a paramedic cautions him: ""Take it easy, mister. You're not well."" (Heh.)

Even though this guilty pleasure was released in 1988, the special effects hold up well; the zombie make-up stil looks pretty decent. This DVD is the ""Divimax Special Edition,"" and it's got okay bonus features, all things considered: an audio commentary with Director Mark Goldblatt, Producers David Helpern & Michael Meltzer, and Writer Terry Black; 8 deleted scenes, most of which  merely expand on already existing scenes; the original electronic press kit, which is a brief behind-the-scenes look at the film; the theatrical trailer; MIFED Promo (which is sort of like a trailer); poster and still gallery; original storyboard art; and the original screenplay set in PDF format on DVD-ROM.

DEAD HEAT isn't going to wow you with its smarts or wit or deep character arcs or its big budget. And it certainly wallows in its share of 1980s cheesiness. But what DEAD HEAT is, is a fun train wreck. Treat Williams puts on a good show.",1251504000,2,4553,4.829487179487179

This movie is genius because it works on so many levels; a side-splitting comedy, a chilling psychological thriller, and mullets, and a haunting warning to mankind not to dabble in the science of resurrection (or any science for that matter because its just too risky). Hey, who would win in a fight between a Cylon and Dead Heat?? Seriously though, I thought the love story between the poor russian peasant girl and the Earl of Devonshire seemed overwraught and somewhat hackneyed, like it was tacked on at the last minute. But overlooking that minor love story element- this is a must see if you like movies, or just good old-fashioned storytelling. Like the Black Hole, which is even better than this movie. Except for Old Bob- he is kind of gay!! So is Vincent for that matter, I think there was some kind of homoerotic element there between these two robots, but I was too young to pick up on that. Kind of like that episode of Different Strokes where Arnold and Dudley have to take off their shirts for the bicycle shop owner and pose like Tarzan.

313741,3,6301108108,"I had no idea this movie even existed until a few months before its release on DVD. I never saw it in theaters when it came out in 1988, and by the looks of its box office receipts I wasn't the only one that missed it (ahem). I was only 11 back then and it was an R-rated film after all, so there's my excuse. How it escaped my keen horror radar in the following 16 years is a complete mystery, however. You'd think that I would have caught it some late night on television or on video at least once in all those years, but DEAD HEAT proved as elusive for me as a successful movie career did to Joe Piscopo.

While Joe Piscopo may not have had a stellar career in movies, as soon as I found out that he was in DEAD HEAT and that the film is billed as half ""buddy cop comedy"" and half ""zombie horror"", that's all I needed to hear. I was sold. In a rare move for me, I bought the DVD without even having seen the movie. My instincts proved correct once again as I found out that zombies plus Joe Piscopo equals comedy gold! Actually, gold might be overstating it. Comedy silver? Maybe. At the very least, DEAD HEAT is pure comedy bronze!

It doesn't take long before it strays from your normal buddy cop formula in a big way. When Roger (Treat Williams) bites the big one in a doggie euthanasia room while fighting a hefty undead two-faced biker (don't ask me about the two faces, I don't get it either) and is resurrected shortly thereafter, it becomes a race against time as he and Doug (Joe Piscopo) try to find Roger's killer. Can they find his killer before his body decomposes and he turns into worm food? Can Doug keep from becoming a walking corpse himself? Who's behind this zombie crime wave? Did Joe Piscopo's career tank after SNL or what?

Piscopo's character Doug is a veritable one-liner factory, churning them out fast and furious. It's probably because we're too busy trying to absorb them all that the audience essentially ignores Treat's character, Roger. Joe Piscopo delivers the lines with ease, some being real gems and some are just plain bad. The bad ones don't linger too long because there are enough good ones to get you through. These one-line jokes make up essentially all of the comedy, and in that respect the script is a little weak.

Like a lot of horror movies, the special effects and makeup are almost a character in themselves. Dead Heat is no exception. I was highly impressed in the job that Steve Johnson (SPECIES) did. With no CGI, all the effects withstand the test of time, even after all these years. There's a particularly nice scene of a woman who fast-forward decomposes right before your eyes. Even better than the decomposition scene is the Chinese restaurant scene. In one of the most phenomenal scenes in all of movie history, you can see all manner of animal get resurrected and get very ornery. From a pig on a platter and a flying liver of unknown origin to, best of all, a completely skinned undead steer on the attack. It's so utterly ridiculous, it's brilliant, and I doubt anything quite like it will ever be seen again on celluloid.

Director Mark Goldblatt's vision for DEAD HEAT was for it to be a legitimate comedy/horror crossover. If you hold it up to that standard it definitely falls short, especially if you compare it to the 80s film that was the most successful at it, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. Where ROTLD was funny, yet still very much a horror film, DEAD HEAT doesn't nearly compare. There's just no horror to speak of. All of the scenes that are supposed to scare just don't work very well. Zombies attacking with Uzis in broad daylight are more laughable than horrific. They would have been better served to just concentrate on the comedy.

Simply put, despite its shortcomings, DEAD HEAT is a fun piece of cheese that is distinctly 80s. Vincent Price has a small, but important role, and what his presence adds to a film you just can't quantify.

When Roger is killed during the investigation, he is brought back to life, by the same element that is resurrecting these criminals, to solve the mystery.

The movie itself isn't suppose to be taken seriously, at least that is how I watched it. Joe Piscopo provides many one liners that are really funny, and one liners can be hard to pull off.  Treat Williams also provides some dry and wry humor.  It's cool that Vincent Price was in this movie, which gives it the official horror stamp of approval.

Naturally, Williams being the straight cop and Piscopo being the wisecracking tough guy cop.  I've always liked Williams, and though his performance is nothing to shout about, I enjoy his presence.  Piscopo is another story.  In general I do like Piscopo, but his role in this film is I guess a real love it or hate it affair.  The humor of the movie is almost all set on him, yet he is probably the unfunniest wisecracking cop I have ever seen in a movie.  He has absolutely no delivery and the jokes seem forced and just plain bad.  It's strange coz he is so not funny that it actually becomes kinda funny.  Funny for reasons other than intended.  Plus, he's supposed to be a big, buff badass, yet he's always saying stuff like, ""Oh, that's gross!"", ""That's really disgusting"", and ""I think I'm gonna throw up"".  These aren't tough guy lines, and he comes off sounding like a wuss.  Steve Johnson's fx are pretty good.  We have a mean looking mutant biker guy, a disintegrating woman, and a Chinese restaurant full of reanimated ducks and pigs and stuff.  Williams' half melted face in the last 10 minutes looks good too.  Some cool appearances here too, including Darren McGavin, who you may remember as the leg lamp obsessed dad in A Christmas Story(""Oh, you should see what it looks like from out here!"").  Vincent Price has a small walk on part as well.  The leading lady is quite flat and boring.  All in all, Dead Heat may be a cheap action/comedy, but it obviously had more money invested in it than other films of this type.  The fx are top notch and the film really doesn't look that cheap at all.  This is no masterpiece for sure, but I must say that I really miss this kind of film, coz stuff like this just isn't made anymore.  Enjoy.",1136332800,14,2392,4.428899082568807
313749,3,6301108108,"I am not sure what to think about this film.  It is billed as a comedy but works better as bad horror.  Comedy seems to only exist as a label.  Sure, Piscopo does do some wisecracking but that hardly makes it a comedy.

The film opens with a jewelry store robbery.  Officers Williams and Piscopo respond to the call and are soon involved in a major shootout where dozens of cops are shot (this is comedy?).  For some reason the perps just don't stop when being shot.  This is the sixth in a series of similar crimes.

The investigation takes the partners to a pharmaceutical company where Piscopo makes a discovery and Williams is killed.  But Williams's ex-girlfriend sees what is going on and resurrects him using a strange device.  Unfortunately the effect is not permanent and Williams only has about twelve hours of new life.  He must use them wisely if he is to solve his own murder and nab those behind it.

There is a lot of death in this film.  First are all of the cops in the opening robbery but we also have quite a few criminals get blown away as well as two love interests.  I just can't believe that such a thing is a comedy.  My guess is that it is more like An American Werewolf in London that people mistakenly label as comedy because there are light scenes to offset the heavy.  But if you are looking to laugh, this is not the place to look.",1102377600,5,1361,4.320158102766799

So anyway, after viewing this rare artifact, the fun is back again... with extras! The deleted scenes were something, but I like the promo kit and even the trailer I never get to watch at all! Fun, enjoyable and something you shouldn't pass it by, this movie features Treat Williams at his best with unbelievable (yet entertaining) dead zombies and animals that will either gross you out or just make you laugh out loud. Its a rare find and its worth on your shelve.",1081468800,,688,4.468253968253968

I try to look at the trailer before I buy the movie and the main reason I bought it was because of the cool special effects of a woman melting.  The cremistery was awesome between the two guys.  I never seen Joe Piscopo in a film; he was a nice surprise and funny too.,1497225600,,317,4.147540983606557

Dead Heat KNOWS it's bad but it doesn't really seem to care. Piscopo is trying too hard to be funny and Williams can't seem to figure if his character is a tragic figure or a loose cannon hell bent on dick jokes. Either way, Dead Heat is perfect mindless fun for a late night cheezy 80's movie night.",1494460800,,473,4.1521739130434785
