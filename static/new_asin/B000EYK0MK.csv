we can become released and feel happy, free,
joyful and loving.",1390867200,,111,4.6
8115874,1,B000EYK0MK,"This material leaves you hanging and if you want to really get any benefit from it, you need to buy his expensive additional courses... which leads to your needing to buy more and more and more courses...

It's a lead-in to more and more and more of your money in his pocket... and even after all of that... you'll find you could've gotten a MUCH greater benefit from going directly to the teachings he CLAIMS his courses are based on... to the DIRECT teachings of Lester Levenson himself.

Bypass this material (in it's entirety). Save your money. Be smart.",1293408000,7,558,4.626262626262626
8115875,1,B000EYK0MK,"This is not the ""release technique"". It is a TV promo for the sale of a bunch of CD's at a much greater cost. Millions watched the promo on free TV and now they want to sell the same promotional for 25 bucks. I sent mine back for a refund. I love Amazon but this CD is a ripoff. My first refund ever. Amazon was excellent about the refund. Five stars for Amazon. Zero stars for Larry Cane.",1213747200,23,389,4.0
8115876,1,B000EYK0MK,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was the Release Technique by Larry Crane.  Instead it is an interview with Larry Crane regarding his Release Technique.  The DVD does not provide any information regarding the actual technique, but instead is just an infomercial convincing you to buy the actual course.  To top it off, it seems that it was ripped from a VHS tape and converted to DVD.",1212451200,27,386,4.647058823529412
