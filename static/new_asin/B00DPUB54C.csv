5846808,1,B00DPUB54C,"1. OK - Shaky camera aficionados. This one is really shaky like shaky on purpose just for effect and not because you are moving.
2. Really bad camera angles; partially on purpose - partially not.
3. 90+% of the movie is just boring travel dialogue between some really uninteresting guys (and probably just not as actors) going to Vegas to do some gambling. Some poorly written story of an encounter (not well understood how the encounter relates to anything else in the movie) with some guy over gambling money. That subplot was meaningless and goes nowhere.
4. At the end their car breaks down outside of Vegas and they see some lights (budget probably $200 for the lights). The lights, I think, are from an alien ship that zaps a couple of people. That's it - end of movie. Who cares!
5. I wonder how much one can make off of doing this stuff? Oh, as usual, the cover art has nothing to do with the movie - just a sales trick.",1392854400,4,928,4.401162790697675

5846810,5,B00DPUB54C,THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS DVD SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING THAT MY FAMILY WOULD LIKE TO WATCH.  WHEW. IT WAS SO GOOD,1392249600,3,108,4.4
5846811,4,B00DPUB54C,"First off, I didn't get on the ""Blair Witch"" not ""Paranormal activity"" bandwagons when they came out; I still have never seen ""Blair Witch.""

That being said, I'd say that the style of this is found footage... so if you aren't great with the slightly shakey screen, be aware.  However if you're gonna see it on your computer or TV at home, I don't think it'll be much of a problem.

My first impression is that it has a ""buddies on a roadtip"" type of tone...4 dudes on a road trip and there's conflict amongst them already brewing. They have their Vegas moments and be honest: if you've been to Vegas you've had those 'did that really just happen???"" moments.

Then it takes a really fun 'turn'... I really don't want to give away the details, but the cover says it all... something happens to our lovable guys!",1392249600,4,811,4.45945945945946
8596158,1,B00DPUB54C,"This found footage movie is more than half over before there is any reference to aliens, nothing like whats on the cover never happens and the guys were never stalked by aliens. I don't know why this was classified as a comedy as there were never any attempts at humor.  Once what your waiting for does happen, (after an average trip to Vegas and trouble with a loan shark), it's not very exciting and you don't really know what's going on other than it's some aliens doing something.  Stuff happens in the last third of the movie, but none of it ever seems to fit together.  All I know is that I'd like to know what kind of camera they were using to record all this footage that was able to survive crashing to the ground from 200 miles up with little more damage than a cracked lens.  Skip the first half of this movie as it has nothing to do with the supposed plot.  Better yet, skip the whole thing.",1506729600,,903,4.257309941520468
8596159,1,B00DPUB54C,"Interesting concept too bad they did it with a hand held camera and no actors to speak of. Well it could've been lack of direction or bad writing or both. It's hard to tell when you decide to make a film so cheap you don't have a cinematographer so it looks like an eight year old shot it while playing with her hair on a tricycle not paying attention to what she's doing.  I think the euphemism is skanky cam no it's shaky cam. Yes it's suppose to add excitement because there is none in front of the cam so shake it and pretend. I still like it better the way the adults did it, seemed to have worked well for them. But then they did have talent on their side.",1506038400,,662,4.0534351145038165

8596161,2,B00DPUB54C,"Jodi Jodi Jodi. Annoying Shakey-cam ET conspiracy film. Disjointed plot, lots of shaky cam. Some guys got together to make a UFO shaky-cam movie. Might have been better had they had a better script. Some effects are pretty good, other are very lame.",1473984000,,249,4.813953488372093

8596165,1,B00DPUB54C,"This was a movie with a good premise but no execution. The first 2/3 of the movie is about a trip to Las Vegas and of course it's being filmed by one of the 4 guys on the trip. Can we all agree that the "" found footage"" gimic is just a weak tool for a lazy director. The idea that you could get lost going over the one hill in a desert is ridiculous. The aliens only appear for about a minute of the film and the ending felt as if it were thrown together.  I've seen worst but I won't be watching this again.",1401062400,2,508,3.792452830188679
8596166,2,B00DPUB54C,"Taken by itself, sections of this are a decent road trip movie, sci-fi, comedy, even a drama. Unfortunately, those sections are mixed together very unevenly, and the result is a bit of a muddle. The cast does the best they can, but the story just doesn't work.",1399593600,,260,4.553191489361702
8596167,4,B00DPUB54C,"This movie popped up on my radar when i heard about the fundraising efforts to get the production off the ground. While not normally a fan of the hand held look(excepting Chronicle), I was willing to give this a shot largely due to Parry Shen's involvement. If you don't know who he is, definitely check out Better Luck Tomorrow, and then the three Hatchet movies(Parry is hysterical in these). This movie quickly establishes the existing relationships of the main characters without beating you over the head with excess backstory, which lets you really appreciate what ends up happening to each of the individual characters. And as a bonus, it has featured art by a big favorite of mine, Jerry Ma!
I definitely recommend this to anyone that like a movie that deftly mixes comedy, real life drama(gambling debts are no joke, kids), possible extra terrestrials, and comic books.",1395014400,5,878,4.9391891891891895
