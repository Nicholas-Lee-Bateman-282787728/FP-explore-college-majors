2647690,5,B000HXDM0A,"I loved this show when it was on PBS (local affiliate).  I have a DVD player that plays all standards, this is PAL version, and is not available in NTSC.  Seller represented it as used, like new.  It was as if I took it out of the shrink wrap!",1297641600,,243,3.9183673469387754
2647691,5,B000HXDM0A,"My main concern before purchase was whether I could play imported DVD's in New Zealand.
I am pleased to report I can, providing I purchase the regional codes for my player to accept format.
Being a bit of a ding dong when it comes to anything electrical I found the whole process reasonably easy

The delivery was marvelous I wanted to give the set to a friend for Christmas and it arrived on the 19th Dec, weeks before the quoted
guideline.
He was so impressed and I  with your service Thank you, we are both enjoying the series.

I am telling all my friends to use Amazon.",1297296000,,574,4.345794392523365
2647702,5,B000HXDM0A,"Always enjoyed this show when it aired on PBS stations. Was disappointed I was unable to find it on video. However, with my region free player, I can now watch whenever I want. Some one please get the PBS stations to play a wider variety of britcoms!",1448841600,,250,4.340425531914893
2647703,5,B000HXDM0A,"Watched this series when I lived in the S.F. Bay Area several years ago.  Absolutely, Loved It.  When I saw it up for sale I couldn't resit even though it meant buying a new DVD player that would handle the format.  Well worth it.",1436832000,,230,4.181818181818182
2647704,5,B000HXDM0A,"Nicely boxed set.  I fell in love with the program when it aired on pbs, but only got to watch one season.  Now I'll see it all at my leisure.  I bought a multi region player so I could watch it in USA with no problem.",1426896000,,218,3.6956521739130435
2647705,5,B000HXDM0A,20-year old series holds up well after all this time.  Most laptops allow you to play these NON-NORTH AMERICAN FORMAT DVDs.,1425427200,,123,4.857142857142857
2647706,5,B000HXDM0A,"You can watch it here in the United States.  You have to have either a computer DVD player or a PAL DVD player to play over here.  I watched the entire set even the extras.  I liked the interviews with the creators, some of the actors involved in the show.  I did not care for the commentaries of the selected episodes writers chose to comment on.  These commentaries were and are quite stupid and sophomoric indeed.  I wish they did a proper commentary of the episodes they chose to comment on.  Now Gran and Marks did a superb job on there interview but they were quite amateurish episode commentaries indeed.  The reason I gave a five star rating for the product review was to me it was more than four star but not a full five star but we cannot give partial star rating.  To me it was 4.75 stars and the episode commentary in my opinion made only .25 stars defective.",1421798400,3,871,4.327160493827161

2647708,5,B000HXDM0A,"A great series. The premise was so clever and impeccably presented. The casting is spot-on, even when the two lead ladies change, the storyline proceeds smoothly. The sets and set dressing is 100% and an enormous effort must have gone into making it look authentic. And it works. All the cast portray their characters with great accuracy and Nicholas Lyndhurst is brilliant, alternating from 1995 to 1942 and back again,  maintaining his character to perfection.",1390089600,,462,5.16
2647709,4,B000HXDM0A,"This was a good series that I haven't seen since before I left the UK in '99.  I am unable to play region 2 DVDs in my US Bluray player but I could rip the video by computer and play it on the HTPC.  It is a fun series, a bit dated, but I like anything with Nicholas Lyndhurst in it.  You may well remember him as Rodney in Only fools and Horses.

This was a good price for a complete collection.",1389571200,,396,3.792682926829268
2647710,5,B000HXDM0A,"Very possibly the funniest UK comedy, along with ""Allo, Allo"". This plays well on my computer. If you are a fan of British comedy, you should see this!",1386547200,,151,4.428571428571429
2647711,5,B000HXDM0A,"I don't know how I happened upon ""Goodnight Sweetheart"", but I fell in love with it instantly. Boasting the type of satire and quick quips that we Yanks expect of BBC comedy with a truly inventive idea of time travel - while still retaining the aforementioned satire and quips - GS is a marvel of humor, history, and television production.

Gary Sparrow (for anyone who doesn't know the series) is a video repairman, who walked down an alley one day as a shortcut to pick up a television set and passed thru a time portal ending up in 1940 London during the blitz. Initially thinking he'd found a 40's theme pub, it was not until he was told how cheap his beer was that he ran out in the street and saw that everywhere it was 1940. Returning to the pub (and wisely not trying to pass on any of his 1993 coins), he convinced himself it was just a dream and played along as tho he were back in 1940. Of course - he learns the truth, and from then on regularly passes back and forth between 1940's and 1990's London.

As a technical note, Gary's passages back and forth thru time take place in a linear fashion - he leaves June 22nd 1993 and arrives June 22nd 1940 at the same time of the day. So when he tells his sweetheart (barmaid Pheobe, played by the incredibly talented Dervla Kirwin), that he'll see her ""next week"" he'd better go back thru time at the appointed day and hour of 1993!

As sitcom fodder, the creators of GS have mined gold. Old sitcom standards of a man making plans with two people on one night take on a new meaning when Gary has to pass back and forth thru time continuously to make both dates, including wearing clothing that will pass for both time periods and worries that he may get caught in a blackout back in 1940!

On a comedic/dramatic note, GS does what no other show can - in order to explain his disappearances to Pheobe, he tells her (back in 1940) that he has an American wife - Marilyn Monroe. Phoebe tearfully pours out her heart to Gary eliciting strong compassion from the viewer, while still getting laughs by talking about, ""I can't very well expect you to give up your Marilyn Monroe for me!"" - excellent writing and acting.

Tho the DVD's I purchased were of European standard and wouldn't play in my DVD players, my computer had NO problems at all. Just buy the whole series (6 of them), at a bargain price, put them in your computer's dvd drive and prepare for the wonderful world of ""Goodnight Sweetheart"".",1314057600,17,2455,4.386813186813187
