I think that I perfered set 1 much better than set 2 though

The series starts out with the pilot episode Brilliant, On the seat grips you at every step of the way, a lot of twist& turns, & one hell of a drama too boot  UNIDENTIFIED ,First UFO  story Introduction of the UFO Shadow & Earth for that matter are baffled by they're sudden appearance all of a sudden from no where. Confetti-check A -OK!, Early telling of the start of setting up SHADOW HQ & the appointing of ED Straker as the head of the organization called SHADOW HEAD QUARTERS. Some woman takes on a young lover & he convinces her to kill her older not with it anymore boring husband. Has a story about Paul Foster first being introduced to & picked by Shadow supreme HQ. He accepis. First thay Straker & company put Frasher to the test. To see if he will be a good fit & totally loyal to them!  First Straker & company tries very hard to discredit Paul's seeing a UFO. They tell him point blank that ""He must be seeing things."" But, Paul does not believe them instead he starts an investigation of his own. And he goes to Straker's movie studio to get some info & back ground details & he Paul begins to do research on the whole thing.

The second part is very good as well but much different. But  I just could not believe that it got cancelled because of very low ratings. What a shame that that had to happen!

I was 7 yrs old when this tv series was new in 1969-1970. Too Bad it only lasted 1 full season only! It should have lasted much longer it was a high quality tv show & way ahead of its time too!",1421971200,,1625,4.136507936507937
