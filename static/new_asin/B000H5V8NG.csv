2628405,5,B000H5V8NG,I watched this Anime a while back and i would have to say it was really great to watch. It has a lot of fan service which is not my most favorite thing but i don't hate it at the same time. But the Anime is really good if you just want something nice and light hearted with some good comedy in it as well. Its about a boy who grew up fearing girls and every time he would touch one a rash would sprout though out is whole body. But one day he got kicked into his bathtub by his next door neighbor and was teleported to another planet where he meets a girl the only girl who when he touches her he doesn't get the rash. They both get teleported back to earth and the story starts from there.,1308441600,,690,3.900709219858156
2628406,5,B000H5V8NG,"""Wimpy guy meets hot girl"" is always the trend with these type of animes. It really does get stale because you've seen one you've seen them all. I might not have enjoyed this as much because of the very wimpy main character who wouldn't have a chance at any of these girls if it were real life of course. Only in anime would such a wimp be desirable. I choked down the first few episodes but it started to balance out. luckily there was another guy who was the semi villain. He had no trouble showing the girls how much he adored them with his hands and his eyes. The match up of the opposite extreme character really made the show interesting. There's A LOT of fan service in this one but it matches the comedy perfectly. The 24 episodes all have fresh new ideas so you can expect something different in just about everyone. It's not exactly been there done that. Although the group is cliche right down to the ""cute pet"" I guess they all have their specialties. I always wondered though where were Yukanari's parent's? What did the neighbors think about him having girls staying over in his house all the time? Etc. Etc. but it's one of those things that wouldn't make it cartoony if you added real logic too it. This one funnier than expected. The ending was great too made me jealous of Yukanari.

Also want to note I started to read the manga out of curiosity. Interestingly enough it's different from the anime. Yukanari is a wimp still but not as much of a wimp as he is in the anime. He's more of just a clueless guy.",1307059200,9,1525,4.350877192982456
2628407,5,B000H5V8NG,"I love comedy and romance anime's and this one was a pretty good one, Harems are common for the most part in anime, but this one is especially hillarious, i must warn you .... be carefull when watching this because it borders along the lines of hentai. Regardless I highly recomend this anime...just don't let your parents catch you watching it, cuz 9 times out of ten...they will come in at the wrong time, and it will be a very akward moment.

2628408,4,B000H5V8NG,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Comedy-Romance, Sci-Fi

Situations: Probably PG+  Maybe even R
Language:  Probably PG+
Nudity:  Probably NC-17 (If live) Probably only R since this is ""only""
  animation.
Violence:  PG

Language options: Dub, Sub have separate on/off. As it should be! (IMO)

Special Features: Clean open/close. Nothing in other words. Didn't really need it though.
A note on disc format: The first half of this series will skip the next episode preview if you skip the end credits. It was fixed in the second half when the previews got more useful anyway. Nothing big, just slightly annoying to me.
For those of you who might not know, sometimes the real ending of a series is AFTER the closing credits of the last episode, this is one of those so don't shut it off when the closing credits start.
This is a pretty stock comedy-romance type anime with a bit of harem. Don't take this to mean it's average though. This is well written and has good character development. While it seems the story line ends with disc one (of four) and it ""devolves"" to a sit-com, it does pull back together well for a great ending. Many of the ""stock"" episodes manage to pull minor twists that make them interesting. There are threads throughout that tie up in the end, but it's still no masterwork of literature. It is very good entertainment though.",1294099200,,1383,4.7489539748953975
2628409,5,B000H5V8NG,"Cute girls, Fan-service, Laughter, and more Fan-service. (and when i say Fan-service I mean FAN-SERVICE...not just bouncing jiggling brests but also panty shots galore and so on and so forth.) Parents be warned slight Nudeity (and LOTS of this slight nudeity) 17 and older only should watch this.

This is now my Favorite Anime out of the nine or ten series that I have. I went out on a limb when i bought it not knowing what I was buying. Its hard to tell when an anime has what your looking for when there are so many people out there saying it has something like (Fan-Service) and it turns out it doesn't have TRUE fan-service. This one has TRUE fan-service (by what the definition of fan-service means)

As for the laughter. Its in there too. It's more or less stupid comidy but in this anime they did a good job of makeing it work and flow with the story. Also its got some adult jokes in it as well. But it all works good.

There are a couple of stupid episodes in it. The kind that make you say...""ok this is NOT what i spent my money on."" BUT two or three of those are good because it makes the other episodes stand out better.

My advice: If your looking for a good funny story-line that delivers LOTS of panty-shots, lots of slight nudity, and adult jokes. This should be right up your ally.

P.S. The Manga of this series is rated 13 and older. And beleave me I have read the manga's and they are toned WAY WAY WAY down for some reason.",1268784000,10,1447,4.266423357664234
2628410,2,B000H5V8NG,"Not particularly funny or titillating, just most unlikable characters and a weak plot. Pity that.",1219795200,3,97,5.533333333333333
2628411,5,B000H5V8NG,"Yes, that's right. This series is actually an improvement on typical fan service. With many well-endowed girls, a perverted anti-hero, and plenty of over the top comedy, I was laughing so hard, I actually couldn't breathe the first time I watched it. Girls Bravo is definitely a series worth picking up if you're looking for a sexy romantic comedy to keep the laughs coming.",1196985600,8,374,4.859375
2628412,5,B000H5V8NG,"Many attractive girls bouncing around in skimpy clothing, that's what Girl's Bravo is all about. And if that's all you're expecting, then you will fully enjoy Girl's Bravo. In addition to the fan-service there is some good drama, many funny circumstances, and a great cast of characters.

If you are a lover of fan-service anime then Girls Bravo absolutely must be a part of your collection.",1179100800,26,391,4.924242424242424
2628413,2,B000H5V8NG,"This series is just painful. The story is cookiecutter Harem anime without much originality. THe main character is a loser as usual but has an allergy to girls and guess what? he gets surrounded by girls. Then there are the annoying rivals who are just over the top to the point of irritation. This series really doesn't have much of a story other than to provide a lot of fan service ad when i say a lot, i mean a lot. There is way too much sexual innuendo going on (as seen with the main girl eating a banana.) This fan service goes on so much that it takes its price by taking away from character development and depth.

Again you have episodes that can be found in all of this genre and you have similar humor. What is worse, there is a story put in but it doesn't show up until the last disc and creates one of the worst endings in anime. It is so bad that you will feel insulted and be glad to be done with the series instead of left wanting more.

I give it 2 stars because some of the stories are fairly funny but those moments are few and far between. I would recommend skipping this series and finding soemething better",1175817600,7,1129,4.174311926605505

2628467,5,B000H5V8NG,"While the fan service is gratuitous at times, there is a really great series underneath it once you get halfway through the first season.  The harem aspect you would expect from a series like this isn't that prevalent since only three women including the main female character actually have feelings for him.  The rest of the series is about Yukinari trying to live a reasonably normal life, going to school, and the various comedy series mishaps he runs into.  The english dub is very good overall though the VO that voices Fukuwama does ham it up a bit from time to time.  If you are a fan of comedies with fanservice with some twists of the tropes you expect from that mix, I would definitely give Girls Bravo a shot.",1496534400,,720,4.515384615384615

2628473,5,B000H5V8NG,"- Comments: Great for viewers seeking some comedy and fan-service. If waifus aren't your thing, then you might want to stay away. There's some romance in this too. But basically, if you want a simple anime to watch, have a few laughs, see some waifus, this isn't a bad option.
===========================================================================================================

- Synopsis: Our protagonist is allergic to females. This leads others to think that he prefers males over females. However, an accidental event leads him to a fateful encounter with a mysterious planet that is inhabited by mainly women. His bathtub ends up being the key to traversing to and from these planets. Fortunately, the protagonist finally meets a girl that doesn't trigger his harsh allergic reactions. Thus, his life finally starts to look up as he grows closer to this girl. Tune in to find out the whacky adventures of Yukinari and friends as they bond throughout their youthful days.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. This is a 4-disc DVD set with 24 episodes. Approximate run-time of 10 hours. It is rated TV-MA due to heavy fan-service.

- Conclusion: Heavy-fan service anime with lots of silliness and emphasizes a light-hearted tone that is enjoyable for a causal audience looking for a simplistic plot, rather than a thought-provoking anime. Plenty of entertainment for those looking for a break from more serious or violent animes and want something simplistic and evokes a warm-feeling inside.

2628572,5,B000H5V8NG,"Man this anime is one of the biggest fan service (aka showing boobs, butt or anything else that sexualize women not for plot development just because the people who made the anime wanted a bigger viewer audience) animes I have ever purchased ever!! here is my review for Girl's Bravo!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Yukinari Sasaki aka Yuki is a high school student who is pretty much average, but there is one problem. He has Gynophobia aka a fear of women! Women and girls constcally bullies and hates Yuki for no reason at all. He is as he says ""so allergic to women/girls  he breaks out in horrible hives and sometimes passes out"". One day after he comes home from school he hears a noise in his bathroom, as he opens the door his nextdoor neighbor girl Kirie Kojima where she freaks out and screams at him that she had to break into his house and take a bath because her's was broken. Then she starts beating him up for ""peeking"" at her naked body, when she kicked Yuki, he flys into the bath tub and then a bright light happened and he is transported to a magical world where he meets this girl named Miharu, When Yuki gets touched by her he dosn't break out in his normal rash or have any allergic reactions to her at all because she is the first and only girl to treat him nice and not bully him. When he questions where is he Miharu tells Yuki that they are her home planet Seiren which is a planet thats right beside earth but can't be seen by earth at all, and most of all, its population is 100% females! So Miharu's sister Maharu comes in asking whats the noise and sees Yuki, she goes into a lovey dovey fit over seeing a boy, when touching Yuki he breaks out into hives then escapes Maharu's graps and goes outside where all the women of the town see Yuki and chase after him trying to make him their husband so they can have kids. After the chase Miharu saves Yuki by diving into the bath tub he came from so Yuki and Miharu go to earth. So then starts the epic adventure of Miharu's stay on earth and tons of trouble for girl fearing Yuki!!

Pros: for the guys reading this review and wanting to know just about the Fan Service, this is all you need to know = Boobs boobs boobs boobs butt boobs, sex jokes and they are completly UNCUT and UNCENSORED. You see every boob uncut, all the swear are in and so is the comical elements this show has.

Pros: for the rest of the people wanting a review. This anime shows A LOT and I mean A LOT of boobs, butts, and sex jokes. This is THE most perverted anime series I have ever seen Funimation ever dub. In EVERY episode there is some girl's boobs and or butt showing uncensored and uncut so you see everything. There are many many many sex jokes and sexual innuendo's. But if you can get past all that it is a funny show with some jokes that everyone can get. Its enjoyable to pass the time

Cons: Story Overall: Honestly there is NO plot to this entire show, sure there is a minor story line but it is hardly ever followed, This is a fan service anime so you get all the anime cliches episodes for fan service lovers is in = going to the beach, going to the hot springs, going to the water amuesment park, going to the amusement park, Cosplay cafe and many many more. The main villian/friend of the group is a giant pervert! The villian in the last half of the show is so badly written in if I was making this anime I would have left it out

Cons 2: mini story plot hole: the anime breaks this show into two seasons, 11 in the first and 13 in the second which confused me why split this into two season, but you get all 24 episode in this dvd package so you get everything!

Physical DVDS: I have read reviews about others who got their dvd's and they were played but some were all scratched to hell, the ones I got were fine with no damage and played perfectly!

Voice acting: the voice acting in this show is first rate! all the voice fit the character perfectly! Yuki is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal who voices the english dub of Sasuke Uchiha from the Naruto and Naruto Shippuden series as well as Prince from The Prince of Persia sands of time trillogy. The main protagisting is voiced by Liam O'Brien who played in both Naruto Series as Gaara the sand ninja. A lot of other people who voice the Naruto series make an appearence.

Over all: I enjoyed it but this is one of those series for those who are not into fan service can say ""yeah I watched it but I wouldn't want to watch it again"". For the fan service lovers this is one you will watch over and over and over, it is the most perverted anime Funimation has ever dubbed (that I have watch from Funimation) so fan service lovers will unite to watch this anime!!!",1430438400,10,4694,4.241610738255034

So, seeing a complete series boxed set on the cheap, I picked it up, not knowing what to expect. Judging by the cover, it looked fairly interesting (fan-service usually is), and the description on the back promised something hilarious.

I had no idea...

The series is about a young man named Yukinari who is allergic to women. Yes, that's right: he breaks out in hives whenever he's touched by one. Which is a shame because his neighbor, Kirei, has a huge crush on him, though she is constantly picking on him and often times punches him whenever he does something stupid (yeah, it's that kind of crush). Well, one knock to the head sends him to Seiren, a world inhabited by ONLY women! Oh boy!

But it is there that he meets Miharu, who is the first girl he can touch without breaking out. However, Yuki and Miharu are transported back to Earth. And that's where the hilarity begins. They meet a parvert named Fukuyama, who also bullies Yukinari; Lisa, Fukuyama's sister, who has a very unhealthy infatuation with Yukinari; and later in the series, we meet Koyomi and Tomoka, two police officers from Seiren charged with finding and bringing Miharu back, only to become trapped on Earth themselves.

The series is well written, and EXTREMELY hilarious. Fukuyama gets a fair ammount of the laughs with his innumerable (failed) attempts to seduce Miharu. And the humor is balanced out by personal drama, as well. Koyomi gets a particularly touching story about her father, who was originally from Earth, and came to Seiren in a manner simmilar to Yukinari, which causes them to develop an emotional bond.

Yeah, pretty much every girl in this series is in love with Yukinari, hence the hilarity of his gynophobia: he can't touch a single one of them, except Miharu.

While the series is short (a scant 24 episodes), this show is well worth your time. Perhaps one of the most underrated anime series' out there, Girls Bravo has enough charm in its dirty minded story to make repeated viewings just as funny as the first.",1397692800,2,2387,4.725961538461538

I watched streaming episodes of it and beyond the nudity and perversion it is a very cute and very funny anime, and when Ebi showed up randomly into the series, he became my fav lil mascot character; he's like Ryo-Ohki from Tenchi Muyo :)

As far as fan service is concerned Girls Brovo is everything I hoped to get from Love Hina, with plenty of topless running around.

But don't pick up this series for the fan service alone.  This series is funny and just fun to watch.  It's the story of a boy who's allergic to women so of course he ends up living with a house full of them.  Oh the bad luck!

Shortly after returning home his relatively peaceful life is thrown into utter chaos when the girl of his dreams follows him home.

The animation, characters, story and English dub are great, but the excessive fan service maybe too much for some!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387152000,3,935,4.765432098765432

2628697,3,B000H5V8NG,"I see alot of folks gave this anime a strong positive rating & I can understand why but for me I was like so so. I've seen alot of anime's of this type of genre: Young insecure male who's terrified of girls, some hott chick from outerspace or where-ever girl falls into his lap pretty much. The young male always has some female childhood friend who likes him but never says anything, just kicks his butt whenever he looks at other girls. No one ever locks their door so in the first episode the hott chick shows up in his room somehow then his childhood female friend shows up to pick him up for school & see's the hott chick in his room & gets angry & kick's his a$$ because she thinks he's taking advantage of some innocent girl, knowing full well that the guy is too shy for such a thing. Sound familiar so far. I wouldn't even give two cents but this anime is not a kids anime, there's plenty of T&A in this just no sex. So then I think to myself, why do the producers who make such anime's continue to use this theme of what seem to be immature Junior High kids runnin around half naked. Then I remember it's Japan, this is how they do things. I've lived there & seen it myself so then, like I said before, hott chick from another world shows up, young boy helps her, young boys female childhood friend is a beeaatch who beats him up all the time, that's pretty much the gist of the series, enjoy...",1369612800,3,1405,4.1881918819188195

The one thing I don't care for is when one of the characters uses Black Magic. Outside of that the story is silly enough that you can watch it over and over again with it always being fresh.

Always be careful when buying any anime that you pay the lowest price... Shop around first.

I was worried I'd be disappointed because the show is a bit (how do we say) up front about the nudity it contains. You'll see LOTS of boob and butt scenes and plenty of red faces, but this series has a really good, humorous, sad, and even heartwarming tone throughout it. Not to mention some of the fight scenes are rather well animated and intense! Here's the basic theme...

A young kid has some serious girl trouble. Yukinari Sasaki has been bullied, picked on and ignored by girls to such an extent he developes a rash when he comes in contact with them. On one fateful day, strangely enough a portal to another world opens in his bathtub and essentially throws him infront of a jaw-droppingly gorgeous and free spirited woman named Miharu who's not the least bit shy when totally nude. Upon contact Yukinari realizes she's the only girl that didn't give him a major rash and they eventually become close friends and lovers. Along the way they make plenty of friends ranging from the feisty, hot-tempered Kiria, to the shady, perverted and outrageously funny Kazuharu Fukuyama, and a nerd named Mamoru who could make Captain Planet seem mild about cleaning Earth of Garbage.

They show full nudity, like nipples not just boob. If you don't like fan service or sexual humor, you might want to watch something else. Overall I say this is a classic anime. I love the characters!

I has many adult situations and includes a lot of fan service but it was funny and offbeat.  So Here are my likes and dislikes.

Like:

The girls are complicated and interesting.  Each has her own personality and you get to know them well.
Fan service is all over the place but it doesnt replace great laughs and good writing.
The colors were vivid and appealing as well as everything being well drawn.
The humor while mostly adult is laughable and I had a great time.

Dislike:

There really isn't any plot at all the shows did have a great ending but no main struggle that everyone was working toward the entire time.

I would recommend this one to anyone looking for a good laugh and not wanting anything too serious.",1358467200,,874,4.248484848484848

2628739,1,B000H5V8NG,"I have no idea why so many gave it 5star, possible reasons:
1. Young and horny, that's not always true, old ppl like hentai too
2. Lack of anime experience, haven't seen enough anime
3. Bad taste

Any anime that use nudity to draw viewer's attention is lacking in imagination and creativity, normally I would only take 1 star off for this catergory, but this anime has brought nudity to the extreme, I mean EXTREME... so... minus 2 stars

Now, let's go to the storyline part. I'm not the type that start watching anime then give up and quit, but this anime made me struggle through. I watched the whole 24 episodes and I think the storyline was unique but longgggg and boringgggg and has alot of BS, normally if the anime is average on storyline and not excellent, I only take off 1 star for this, but this one is not average, it's HORRIBLE, so... minus 2 stars. If you don't want the same struggle happen to you, my suggestion: 1. don't watch this 2. watch only first 2 episodes and the last 2 episodes.

Seriously... whoever made this, you should go back and do what you are good at, making 2 or 4 episodes hentais, your anime career is over.

I know my words are harsh but it's the truth, I'm not the type that side with the majority if they are wrong.
Even Pokemon, the anime that kids enjoy is way better than this one, if this anime doesn't have nudity, maybe, just maybe the kids might like it.
If you want real anime, good anime, try Fruits Basket. You know I know what I'm talking about, you know I ain't trolling, I'm just straight forward and honest.
If want nude, go watch hentai, way better, this one fail as an anime or hentai, it's good for nothing, not even for kids.

This anime deserve unbiased rating of 1 star.",1353974400,5,1739,4.354938271604938

First couple of episodes were standard fair. Worthless guy meets hot girl alien, love at first sight, etc. etc.
Then, quite unexpectedly it turned into one of the funniest animes I've watched in a long time.

Innuendos abound throughout the series. Some so blatant that I found myself saying ""OH COME ON!"" at the screen a number of times.

The voice over work is top notch.
Liam O'Brien (known for Gaara in Naruto) voices Kazuharu Fukuyama. One of the secondary characters. He's basically an over the top pervert with the resources of Tony Stark. O'Brien really goes all out, and adds a maniacal laugh to the character that is as unique as Mark Hamill's ""Joker.""

Also many of the jokes in the English Dub feel like they were translated for a western audience. It's hard to explain and I don't want to add spoilers so just trust me.

Miharu is a sweetheart and best of all, Yukinari isn't allergic to her. The story is basically about their relationship and all the people trying to sabotage it. It sucks to be allergic to girls but with a girl like Miharu, who cares about all the others.

This series might seem like a mindless excuse to see chicks half naked. That may be part of the appeal, but there is much more to it than that. There is a pretty good plot with lots of interesting characters. The characters develop serious relationships and have real drama that keeps you interested in the story. By the end of the series, you are pretty attached to the characters, and want them to have a happy ending.

This series has a whole lot to offer. Comedy, action, drama, suspense, and romance. As I said before, this may seem like a mindless series at first glance, but it's got more substance than that.

This is a romantic/comedy type of anime, but i considered it to be more of a comedy, but overall this was worth gettin and i keep watchin' it over and over.",1327536000,,310,3.9365079365079363
2628751,4,B000H5V8NG,Another OK series I just couldn't get into. I did make me laugh at times and I thought the idea was good but I found myself not as involved as I expected to be. This is another one of those that just didn't grab me like I hoped it would. There were good parts and it's ending was nice but I just wasn't really that impressed. I still think it's a look if you like this type of anime.,1326412800,,383,3.8607594936708862
2628752,4,B000H5V8NG,"Girls Bravo follows the story of Yukinari, a boy who has had such terrible experiences with girls that he not only fears them, but breaks into a rash if any touch him. He then proceeds to travel through his bathtub to another world where women make up over 90% of the population. He meets a girl who doesn't give him rashes, and they travel back to his house.

After this, most of the rest of the series takes place on Earth where Yukinari becomes surrounded by girls, and constantly has to deal with their shenanigans. His house (he lives alone, his parents are gone) becomes filled with girls living with him. He also becomes the love interest of about half of the female cast.

The positive points of the series is it's humor. The series does not take itself seriously for a minute, and allows itself to have a lot of fun with ridiculous plot points. In one episode, a girl drinks pure ethanol, ending up replicating herself thousands of times. Then the clones go off on a massive eating binge, only stopped by a brave man in a banana suit. The show also has a fair amount of nudity. Literally, almost every episode starts with someone naked in a bathtub or shower. The show never goes beyond nudity, thus keeping it from being one of those cartoons. Most of the nudity is used to a comedic effect, where a character accidentally walks in on another and then gets hit in the face.

The negative point of the show is that there really is no storyline. Each episode is fairly independent of the others after the first 5 or 6 where every character is introduced. After that, the show is just punchline after punchline until the last 3-4 episodes of series 2 where they throw together some story to have a finale and end the show.

The show consists of the shy yet good hearted guy, the comically rich pervert, the neighbor with the secret crush on Yukinari, a woman obsessed with Yukinari who performs black magic, a girl who is scared of boys, and the little kid who doesn't like being called a little kid with her cute obligatory animal. Also, you have Yukinari's main love interest, someone who can eat as much as she wants without gaining weight, can protect her man through explosions, is very naive, a virgin, completely devoid of either modesty of jeleousy, very attractive, and quite literally destined to be with him. In other words, the perfect woman according to anime world.

So yes, the show is very cliche. But it is one of the few shows that knows very well it is cliche and decides to just have fun with it. A good anime if you want something fun to watch but don't care to get ingrained in some kind of story. There is pretty much nothing to be confused about, a very easy watch.",1314835200,,2696,4.471544715447155
