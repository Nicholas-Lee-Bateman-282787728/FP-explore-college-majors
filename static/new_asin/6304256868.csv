822906,5,6304256868,"""For now we see eachother through a glass DARKLY..."" states 2nd Corinthians 13:12, and that's really how you have to view this movie. In order to appreciate its uniqueness you have to understand its subtle dark  side. Fundamentally it's about how a situation unveils the repressed  desires (I should say 'passions') of a young 'christian-cult' man, and  exploits the consequences of those 'passions' once they are realized and  unleashed.  In short, a film that I'm sure most human-beings can relate to  albeit to a lesser degree (one would hope anyway!) It has some magical  moments: the silver shoe, the cave with its 'part-of-time' and the dressing  of ones self in barbed-wire, to name but a few.  But that's really the tip  of the ice-burg to Mr Noons passion.  Whilst watching this film I was  struck by Ridleys portrayal of raw human emotion, built around a solitary  setting that adds to this films errie atmosphere and serves as the muse for  its poetry, leading to a rather 'explosive' end of events. Fraser really  stands out with a fantastic performance through out.  He really embodies  the two attributes of a shy, stuttering boy and physco-monster avenger that  make Darkly dark (excuse the pun) that you really don't know whether to  side with him or hate him. Whether you've just discovered Frasers talents,  admire Ridleys work or just love errie, atmospheric films, this one's a  must.
By the by, if anyone knows where I can get my hands on the films  soundtrack (especially the PJ Harvey song) I would be indebted for life.",947808000,23,1543,4.8538461538461535
822907,3,6304256868,"A must-see for fans of Brendan Fraser, Ashley Judd and Viggo Mortenson.  Otherwise, save your money and your time.  Ridley's effort here plays like a master's thesis in film rather than a professional effort.  He should  refer to his film library for ways to show madness growing other than the  absurd use of the silver shoe or the actual visual presence of Darkly's  dead parents - up in a tree?  Please.  Despite this criticism, it's most  likely your only chance to see Brendan Fraser stutter, experience hopeless  longing and masturbate on screen ever.  Ditto for Ashley Judd's uninhibited  sexual encounters with Viggo Mortenson.  I think we can guarantee that  you'll never see her thighs photographed that way ever again or see her on  screen with unshaved armpits!  Despite the poor quality of the film  overall, these two young actors come off well.",947203200,8,859,4.936619718309859
822908,5,6304256868,"The tiny sub-story of the shoe is, to me anyway, what makes this movie really stand out from anything I've seen. And the end credits song performed by PJ Harvey is pretty special too. Thriller + fairytale =  goosebumps.",943488000,,219,4.615384615384615
822909,4,6304256868,"This is a very fine little movie that deserves more attention.  Granted, it is not for everyone, but neither is FARGO or PULP FICTION.  The acting, esp. by the leads, Judd and Fraser, is on-target, and the photography is  consistently interesting.  But it is in the oddness of the situation, the  ""plot,"" that the movie distinguishes itself from just about  anything I've seen lately.  DARKLY NOON is a strange melding of many ideas  and emotions--guilt, repression, religious zealotry, sensuality, violence,  love, beauty, grotesqueness--that we all know, to some degree.  It most  closely resembles SLINGBLADE, though it is not quite in that league.  Yet  it is symbolically rich and, though unsettling, a breath of fresh air.  This movie resists all forumlas, and it is one of the, say, top twenty  movies I've seen in the last three years.",939600000,2,843,5.0510948905109485
822910,3,6304256868,"I never thought to see Brendan Fraser as a psychopath, but I was wrong.  To watch his masterfully played descent into madness was a thing of beauty.  Unfortunately, it was the ONLY thing of beauty in this film.
I'm  afraid Ashley Judd could not act her way out of a paper bag in this one. I  actually found myself hoping Darkly would hurry up and kill her to shut her  up<sigh>  Not the way one is supposed to feel about a psychopath.
The way the story comes together makes me think that Judd's character  was trying to push darkly over the edge, knowing up front how he felt, she  deliberately (it seemed) pushed his figurative nose into every  contradiction she could find, up to refusing to call him by his name.  You  cannot give someone a worse insult IMHO than to tell them that their very  identity is inappropriate.
Still, to see another and incredibly different  face to this wonderfully diverse actor (Fraser) made this film worth  watching, though I doubt it will end up on my personal hot rotation of  movies.",935193600,,1021,4.532967032967033

823159,4,6304256868,This movie is definitely worth watching for the beautiful actors Viggo Mortensen & Brendan Fraser not to mention a gorgeous blond Ashley Judd! Wildly suspenseful plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the end!,1463443200,,227,4.7
823160,3,6304256868,"I would have had no idea about this movie unless it was recommended by Mark Kermode (in a recent interview with director Philip Ridley) because, to be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of either Brendan Fraser or Ashley Judd. Good thing I gave it a shot, though. THE PASSION OF DARKLY NOON isn't the least bit subtle in its thematic approach, but it crafted a unique, compelling story whose implications are hard to ignore. It examines the darker tendencies of religious fundamentalism, its obsession with the nuclear family and how easily a brainwashed and distorted mind can resort to violence when beliefs are challenged. Brendan Fraser plays Darkly Noon, a man raised in a Bible-believing cult who, through circumstance encounters Callie (Ashley Judd), who lives with her boyfriend Clay (Viggo Mortensen, in a wordless performance). Initially, Clay is away and Darkly finds himself sexually attracted to Callie despite being conflicted. Things take a turn for the worse when Clay returns. That's all you really need to know going in. Ashley Judd gives a decent performance, although she serves more as eye candy in some respects (but intentionally so). I wasn't as sold on Brendan Fraser's performance initially, but his choices did make more sense as the story progressed. Viggo Mortensen also did what he could playing a mute. Ultimately, the blunt force approach to the themes in the story cheapened it a little (for me, at least), but it was very effective at eliciting an emotional reaction at all the right points. What tipped the film in a more positive direction was the melancholy, mostly piano score which conveyed a sense of isolation and unrequited desire that are at its heart. There were also a couple of songs, one of which plays over the closing credits, that I really liked. This isn't a film I'd recommend to the casual movie-watcher (or an overly religious person, who would probably take offense to the portrayal of religion), but for the more adventurous person who seeks out under-seen gems. While not perfect, this one will probably stay with you (and me) for quite a while.",1451606400,,2099,4.949008498583569
823161,5,6304256868,"A young man raised in a religious cult that is raided and set on fire loses his parents and somehow survives the attack.  Found wandering, in shock, a kind, beautiful woman finds him and takes him in, nursing him back to health while her lover is gone for a few days to clear his head.  The young man has absolutely zero clue about anything but bible verses and what is ""sin"" and what is ""right"".  Apparently, he has never made a decision of his own nor been exposed to a woman other than his mother.  He suddenly discovers what lust is, and feels overwhelmed with guilt, punishing himself in sick ways that make cutting look like a walk in the park in order to assuage his ""guilt"" for his feelings.  The woman truly cares about him, is a good person, but also lives according to what she believes is right for her and the small, conservative town thinks she is a witch.
He meets an older woman in the woods one day and she tells him the woman is a ""witch"".  Turns out the house the young woman lives in used to be hers and her husband, who took her in.  She blames the young woman for his death, a heart attack and the house was left to the son, the young woman's lover who is mute.  Brendon Frasier's character is solid as a sheltered, guilty, religious zealot with delusions - mentally ill and traumatized.  Ashley Judd, who plays the young woman is equally loving and kind.  SPOILER ALERT:  Then ending ends in tragedy resulting in the culmination of his delusions and need to cleanse the world of both of them.

It's definitely not for everyone, but I liked the original idea and the very dark nature of the story indeed.  You will either really like it or really hate it, depending on your own belief system and preference for high or extremely low budget movies.  A good indie film, very low budget but original story, which is rare these days. I gave it 5 stars for the eerie feeling it provides without background music and much production at all.  Hard to believe two virtually unknown at the time, now A-list actors made what could have been a poor film into something that definitely affects you one way or the other.

It felt much more like something from the mid-80's than 1995. The production was terrible, the story just didn't gel, and any hope of believable events was washed down the drain with the poor lack of continuity in the effects - wounds that are there one minute and gone the next, sparks erupting into a blaze when a lathe-type device is wielded, fresh twigs with green leaves igniting into flames at the mere touch of a lighter, on and on.

But then it all falls apart beneath the weight of nonsensical symbolism and art-school pretension, combined with an endless climax that refuses to stop or become interesting. I'm probably harder on this movie than a movie that had no potential and didn't accomplish anything. This one had promise, but it absolutely failed to deliver.",1376611200,,600,5.315789473684211

I really would have liked so see some fleshing out of the characters. Why they were who they were and why they did what they did...I mean the girl was very strange in her own right as was her boyfriend when he showed up. This is a hard movie to classify. It isn't really a horror movie nor any other genre. It was like they came up with a neat name and then couldn't even get the blood and guts right. I don't think Mr. Fraser really worked as the strange cultest with a fixation on Ashley Judd. Miss Judd came across as a scatter brained sex addict/*hore and was completely unbelievable. I have forgotten the ""boyfriend's"" name. Which is just as well. It didn't fly as b & g or a horror movie either. If you are looking for movies for a ""scary movie weekend"" sleepover...do the Friday the 13th or Jason movies or even the laughable Chuckie movies.

823273,4,6304256868,"<strong>The Passion of Darkly Noon</strong> (Philip Ridley, 1995)

Ah, 1995. I vaguely remember all the teenaged girls swooning over this movie back in the day. I assume it had something to do with Brendan Fraser's naked backside, which appears briefly. This is back when both Fraser and a deliciously sensual Ashley Judd's stars both eclipsed that of their co-star, an already well-traveled, but not yet A-list, actor named Viggo Mortensen. (In fact, it was the trifecta of this film, <em>The Prophecy</em>, and <em>Albino Alligator</em>, all released in 1995-96, that really propelled Mortensen into the public consciousness in a way he hadn't been previously. Then along came Peter Jackson, and the rest is history.) Because of all the fangirl-worship, I always pushed this one onto the backburner when it came to actually sitting down and checking it out; I shouldn't have.

As we open, Darkly Noon (Fraser), the only son of a now-deceased strictly religious couple, regains consciousness in the woods. (Given his injuries, I think we are to assume there was some sort of vehicular accident; we find out later what really went down.) He finds his way to a dirt road and stumbles down it for a while, eventually almost getting hit by Jude (<em>Apollo 13</em>'s Loren Dean), a delivery guy who's one of the only people from the nearby town who is willing to interact with a couple of local outcasts, Callie (Judd) and her currently-absent boyfriend Clay (Mortensen). Jude drops him there, and Callie nurses him back to health. Darkly has never met anyone quite like Callie, overtly sensual and free-spirited; it doesn't take long before his religious beliefs are butting heads with his attraction to her. This is exacerbated when Clay comes home, and then even further when Darkly, on a walk in the woods, meets Roxy (<em>Twin Peaks</em>' Grace Zabriskie), who has quite a grudge against Callie...

I'm pretty sure Ridley (<em>Heartless</em>) wanted this movie to feel like a dream, despite the realist nature of the cinematography (nothing is ever in soft focus here, and as Captain Peacock was won't to say, ""thank heaven for <em>that</em>.""). It's the only way to pass off some of the movie's sillier scenes (more than once I was put in mind of that annoying blowing plastic bag in <em>American Beauty</em>) and still like it as much as I did. The acting is impeccable all around, the movie is usually well-paced (there are a couple of early scenes that drag like Ashley Judd's shift over her nipples), and the subject matter is just crazy all the way around. Did I mention Lou Myers (<em>A Different World</em>) doing his best Garrett Morris impersonation as the town's undertaker/ex-preacher? Fun stuff indeed. *** ",1335484800,2,2722,5.042222222222223
823274,1,6304256868,"Wow, what a stinker. Aims for artsy and devolves into a pretentious, silly mess. Fine actors hamming it up with a bad script and poor direction.",1309996800,,144,4.576923076923077
823275,3,6304256868,"Where is this supposed to be taking place?  And when?  The couple is living in the forest to escape being looked down upon in town for not being married?  Darkly used to belong to a religious sect/cult in which his parents were killed, again by those vicious ""local townspeople"".  So when and where is this taking place?  100 years ago?  Can't be - everything looks modern.  Then we got this Quaker of a character in Darkly Noon, who falls in love with the woman, Calley.  Calley's man, Clay, actually goes along with her idea to have him stay with them.  Bad idea.

Now, if your can get past some of the silliness in the basic set-up of the story, you may be able to enjoy the lush beauty of the forest and the valley where it all takes place.  Brendan Fraser does a reasonable job as the repressed and stuttering Darkly Noon.. Darkly's a bit of a nut-job at times, though still likable in a way.  You can't completely blame him after all.  Calley's always in the skimpiest of halter tops and short skirts, driving poor Darkly mad!

Later he meets an older woman and fellow wack-job also living in the forest not far from Calley and her husband, who turns out to be Clay's mother, and who holds Calley responsible for the death of her husband and for stealing her mute boy away from her.  She gives Darkly the idea that Calley is a witch.  Darkly in an attempt to deal with his conflicting emotions embarks on a course of nightly mutilations.  Yes, good old Darkly is slowly losing what's left of his mind.. and we get to sit through it - yay!  Later, we're even treated to a visit by Darkly's dead parents who ask him if he's been eating properly, saying his prayers and oh yeah, have you killed that darn witch yet?

Viggo Mortenson does a great job of the boyfriend Clay, the only one with any sense in this movie.  Ashley Judd plays the clueless Calley.

You'll probably find yourself laughing it's so over the top at times, and just plain ridiculous at others, but that's Hollywood for you.",1208822400,,1996,4.428571428571429

I love the scene with the big sparkling shoe on the lake and I think it's a shame you find out the reason why it's there in the end of the movie because I think that could have been left unsaid.

For those of you who loved the mood of Lynch's Twin Peaks or the intensity of Blue Velvet, or those who really enjoy a slow brooding atmosphere above the noise and chaos of standard Hollywood action fare, it's a real treat.

The stranger and more 'surreal' elements of the film are actually very clearly explained within the film by the characters themselves! You won't have to look up the meaning online unless you weren't paying attention.

Brendon Frasier is one of those actors I'd come to hate, having seen him in various painful comic roles over the years (I had to clean my eyes with a wire brush after The Mummy 1 and 2) so I expected little from him. However, his portrayal of the conflicted, guilt-ridden main protagonist is really wonderful, disturbing and moving.

It's obviously not a film for everyone, but I really urge you to see it for yourself. Don't expect a hollywood blockbuster with guns, bitchez 'n' bling. Don't expect a film focused on Viggo (although his character is a wonderfully original invention). Expect something considerably more haunting and elegiac.

Several friends of mine and I suffered this absolutely bizarre film together. We now have a club going. Whenever we see anything in a film now that seems disconnected from the storyline, or flat out makes no sense, we look at each other and say, ""Ah! The silver shoe."" This refers to the almost completely unexplained appearance of a oversized silver lame shoe, casually floating down a stream. Brandon Frasier's expression at that moment- complete and utter confusion- is perhaps the best single description of the entire film. That's how it is likely to make the watcher feel.
There is nothing deep here. Someone's trying to convince the watcher that because it is arcane, the film has meaning. It does not. And it brooks no apologies for it either.

Wild and sometimes incomprehensible beauty runs through the photography, scenery, characters, and story. The beautiful girl has a very dangerous innocent sexuality that can torture men. Fraiser's naive innocence about his own primal passions and ""normal people"" and indeed his own consciousness is utterly tragic and frightening. His pain is both sympthetically touching and disturbingly distancing. The scenery is wonderful, but keeps reminding  us of remoteness and isolation. There is lots of beauty in paradox, or contradictions.

(Interesting touch that he stutters awkwardly in his new world with the people who have rescued him, but does not stutter in his own internal conversation with his dead parents.)",1175212800,7,897,5.258741258741258

823439,3,6304256868,"The title ""Passion of Darkly Noon""  defines this movie: weird.

Period.

Darkly Noon is the name of the character, who is obviously either

off his medication or seems to be going through several trauma in

his life.

The movie, to be sure, is acceptably filmed, interesting and

encouragingly innovative and original, and  will appeal to the

younger age bracket mainly.

Much if not the entirety, of this picture, is Salvador Dali-esque,

such are the surreal elements shown, such as the gigantic circus

prop ( a shoe ) floating down the river, the elephant, or even, the

bitter widow living in a Winnibago in the middle of the ""Magic

Forest"", while her son lives with a ""witch"" - the character played

by Ashley Judd, who is called such a name mainly from the libido she

naturally either unknowingly or calculatingly shows to the

astonishment, embarrassment and anguish of the younger frustrated

character, played by Brendan Fraser.

To be sure, Fraser is not a great actor, as compared to the natural

talent of Judd, or even, Grace Zabriskie or Viggo Mortensen, for

example. Loren Dean also does a fine job, as a hard working young

man surviving tooth and nail, with a funeral home operator selling

coffins, and other services. But Fraser, at the end of the day, did

an honest day's work, gave it all he could and doesn't seem entirely

bad in the role.

For 99% of viewers, PASSION OF DARKLY NOON will be one of the most

perplexing, incomprehensible, unfathomable movies imaginable.

But then, if you can get a kick out of seeing Viggo's and Judd's

characters teasing the young man, who himself, is tortured by his

own fanatically religious upbringing, ( of an outcast sect), played

by Fraser, and like Dali's paintings,  you'll enjoy this picture.",1167955200,8,1768,4.828859060402684

823442,5,6304256868,"Well, at least it grows on me. I like Philip Ridley's movies because they usually feature Viggo Mortensen, along with the kind of imagery that my brain produces on its own when it's feeling creative.  Go into one of his films, and you're where the id and its lawless hankerings define the world and tell the story. You can best savor The Passion of Darkly Noon if you don't allow yourself to go all left-brained and analytical, because this is not a narrative wedded to factuality, and its psychological realism is selective.

I heard somewhere that Passion was filmed in the mountains of Germany, but the setting is supposed to be the mountains of North Carolina, with which I am personally familiar.  So I can vouch that up there it doesn't get protractedly, viciously hot as depicted in the film, but the heat's there for a reason, as symptom and provocateur of unhinged behavior. As the film opens, it's deranging hot, suffering hot; sunlight falls with a punishing coppery sheen on all surfaces, and faces and other exposed areas are slick and oily with sweat. Young Darkly Noon (Brendan Fraser) is a dazed wanderer, the sole survivor of a cult.  Apparently the cult's neighbors have gotten sick and tired of the cult in their midst and slaughtered the cult members.  Darkly has narrowly escaped this conflagration and fled into the countryside.

After collapsing on the road, Darkly is brought to one of the few homes in the area and taken in by Callie (Ashley Judd), whose lover Clay (Mortensen) is off on one of his occasional extended camping trips in the woods.

Despite the remoteness of her little homestead and the fact that she's alone there (and lacks a telephone to call for backup - many of the modern conveniences don't figure in this story) Callie takes Darkly in. We learn that the people ""in town"" regard Callie as a witch, and it's easy to believe that she's a disrupting force in the same way as Winona Ryder's character in The Crucible: the best-looking and most overtly sensuous woman in a small, insular, ignorant place has often been at risk for such accusations.  Judd's Callie is innocently, pathologically fearless, going in her minimal nightgown to check on her sick guest; one can believe she doesn't really mean to incite him.  It's easy to accept Callie as sensual but not vain; her armpits are furry, her golden hair appears to have been hacked with nail scissors, so her often-backlit head resembles a ragged yellow chrysanthemum.  Perhaps she does all that she does in a kind of catlike ease within her own skin, not to incite or gratify anyone else.

On her own turf, secure in her convictions, she believes that she controls the situation far more than she actually does.

Skimpily clad, cheerleader legs bare to there, Judd's Callie pads and paces languorously, and once Darkly is awake to notice, he's so riled he can barely say a word to her without stuttering.  When Callie discovers that he grew up in a cult and thinks sex is a sin, she endeavors to change his ground-in Christian cultic convictions for her easygoing neopagan views.  She won't use his name, nicknames him ""Lee,"" and lectures him earnestly, as adult to idiot child: ""Lee, I want to talk to you...""  She tries to coax him into a hot spring and, when he refuses, strips to her slip and has her soak with him as a half-delighted, half-consternated watcher.  Fraser's face is a study, rubbery and twitchy and somehow unfinished-looking; his changeable eyes continually fight it out between the need to look and the fear of looking. His big body is carried in a childlike way, if you can imagine a six-foot-four, vastly-physically-ill-at-ease child; his stutter is impenetrable.  But only until Darkly decides how he should deal with Callie, and then his stride smoothes out, his speech attains perfect fluency.

Callie's arrogance, her assumption that showing Darkly a more comfortable approach to life means that he will/should accept that approach, is an innocent arrogance.  Really, it's rather like the Bush Administration's apparent idea that other cultures don't exist in any consequential way and should greet forced reform with open arms and instant compliance-only Callie means well. She also means well when Clay returns and she coaxes Clay to let Darkly join their family.

Now, in real life, I don't believe for a minute that any female that hot thinks for one single moment that she can bring a young, sex-starved, heterosexual male into the ""family"" of herself and her lover, with whom she's obviously besotted, and expect the arrangement to work out fine for all involved.  However, in the world of the film, Callie does expect exactly that.  She's wrong; something really, really nasty ensues; her fragile little house gets burned down; poor Clay, while defending her from her psychotic charity case, sustains enough injuries to sideline a whole football team. I will say that one of the star turns in this film is done by Mortensen just before the denouement.  At that point, Clay and Callie are deep in some very delightful, semi-rough foreplay, and Clay, in a daze of arousal, is confronted by his rampaging guest, and within a second or so is in full combat mode, fighting for Callie's life and his own. It's a fierce, fabulous scene, with a genuine startle-and-flinch factor that I value - believable, legitimate, genuinely frightening film violence.",1132358400,8,5379,4.880351262349067

823554,5,6304256868,"The passion of darkly noon is a beautiful movie that draws you in to its gorgeous locations and settings, before revealing the truth behind its lovely exterior.

Darkly noon (Brendan Fraser) is a young man whose family was brutally shot and killed, while the local townspeople where busily mutilating the religous sect he was from, Darkly noon, an innocent, rather child-like individual escapes. We find him running through a set of jewel-like lush forests where he collaspes and gets picked up by Jude. A young man who delivers supplys to Callie(Ashley Judd) and Clay (Viggo Mortenson). Two lovers that live for themselves in little house where Clay builds coffins for a living.

Callie sees the distrough and feverish Darkly and decides to take him under her wing. This is the start of a passionate desire that Darkly developes for Callie, who does nothing but try to be a mother and friend to him. Enter Clay, who lets Darkly stay on after Callie's insistance and tries to draw the younger man out of himself and his moody persistance of silence.
Darkly's anger and resentment towards Clay, and Callie's love for him comes to a head when he sees the couple kiss. Not knowing how to deal with the desire and anger that is pervading his body, Darky runs off into the wood to get away and try to get a grip on his emotions that are overrunning his soul.

There he finds a woman that we find out to be Clay's mother, and who accuses Callie of being a witch. Her reason being that she killed her husband, and stole Clay away from her with her seductive charms. Darkly listens, and grasps onto her words like a drowning man. Beliving that it is not he that is in the wrong, but Callie, for she is truly a witch, and has cast a spell on his soul.  Having grown up in very religous atmosphere, Darkly believes his lust is from the Devil, and that Callie is trying to tempt him to his death. Visions of his dead parents help to reinforce such beliefs, and Darkly goes on a rampage of death and destruction.

The ending to this movie relieves some of the darkness that penetrates this film, but not much. Its a sad ending no matter what happens, and it is doubtless that either way with this movie turns out will leave you feeling rather depressed.

As  a side note, this movie does have some rather intense scenes, such as when Darkly covers his body with barbed wire, wearing it like a coat. The end sequince where he takes off his shirt and we see the decaying flesh around the punctures is rather, well, much. However, the movie was very well written, with riveting performences from Brendan Fraser, Viggo Mortenson and Ashley Judd. The score for the film is really haunting also, which only enhances the overall effect of the movie.

823556,4,6304256868,"Written and directed by little-known, Phillip Ridley (The Reflecting Skin), 1995's ""The Passion Of Darkly Noon"" is an almost ethereal Grimm's twisted fairy-tale that turns quicky into spiraling jealousy, self-mutilation, pyschosis and death.
A confused young man, Darkly Noon (Brendan Fraser) stumbles into a forest clearing and is picked up off the road and taken to a farmhouse inhabited by a mute carpenter, Clay (Viggo
Mortensen) and his beautiful but very hirsute lover, Callie (a Clorox blonde, hairy armpitted, scantily dressed and very sweaty, Ashley Judd).
We discover that Darkly has fled from a strict religious commune/cult which has been ransacked by local rednecks who have shot and killed his parents.
While Clay is away, Callie will play and so, Callie decides to ""take in"" Darkly as one of the family.  Darkly lives in the loft of the barn, spies on Callie, lusts after Callie and after Darkly does some ""spanking the monkey"" in the hayloft while watching her, he is just about to make his move when Clay arrives back home.  Darkly is immediately enraged with passion, lust, jealousy and most with religious contempt and righteous indignation!  He inflicts pain upon himself, has visions in the woods, and finally has a religious experience that leads him to some ""very un-Christianlike"" behavior to say the least, smiting everyone in his path.
This film is not for everyone. Even fans of Frazer and Mortensen won't approve because they both play roles that are far from their normal typecasting.  Although everyone turns in decent performances some viewers might be disappointed.  But hey!  If you like Ashley Judd, barbed wire and hairy armpits this will be right up your alley!

823557,4,6304256868,"The Passion of Darkly Noon is a strange, mesmerizing film that you can't help but get sucked into when you turn it on. It stars Brendan Frasier, Ashley Judd and an early role from Aragorn - Viggo Mortensen, sporting the same scruff and locks as he did in LOTR. The film is permeated with bizarre imagery, very much dream-like, as another review noted.
To me the film deals with the repression of feelings. Darkly Noon, the Brendan Frasier lead, was raised in a cultish Christian community which was pillaged by nearby townsfolk - they killed all of the cult, leaving only Darkly Noon alive. He finds his way onto Ashley and Viggo's ranch where they invite him to stay.
From here we see Darkly try to express his sexual feelings for Ashley, feelings which he was never allowed to express as a normal boy developing into a man, and he expresses them in the most horrific ways. The only way he knows how to appropriate his new feelings of lust is by hurting himself - using barbed wire, glass, etc. - and eventually others. It's a powerful statement that feelings left unexpressed (or rather, disallowed to express) will still evince themselves in one way or another, sometimes in very bad ways.
We also learn that Brendan Frasier is a great actor and it's unfortunate he always chooses roles like Dudley Dooright and George of the Jungle. The last thing we learn is that Ashley Judd is really, really hot. But we knew that already.",1083715200,2,1429,4.6299212598425195

Darkly Noon is not the description of a time of day but the name of Brendan Fraser's disturbed character.  He is the product of an overly religious parents.  When they are murdered, Darkly escapes to the forest and is later found and taken to a couple Callie (Ashley Judd) and Clay (Viggo).  They are lovers, which quickly becomes the centre of Brendan's problem and their nightmare.  His religious upbringing disdain they are living ""in sin"", but as Judd nurses him back to health, he becomes obsessed with her.  The conflict of his physical desires, the growing obsessed clashing with his religious teaching pushing him over the edge.  It is easier to believe she is a witch twisting his mind, than to deal with his own feelings of jealousy and sin for wanting her.

823560,5,6304256868,"Wow! I can honestly say that ""The Passion of Darkly Noon"" is the most gloomy and disturbing film I have ever seen.
The plot is a very melancholy one. Darkly Noon is a young Christian man whose life is torn apart when intruders invade his cult's dwelling, killing his parents. He finds his shelter in the house of a youthful couple, Callie and Clay. From the day he meets her, Darkly is smitten by Callie, and swiftly becomes insane as he realizes how unavailable she is. After he ventures into the nearby forest, Darkly hears from multiple sources that Callie is a witch who plays with men's minds, and that she and Clay are living in sin. He decides to take Callie and Clay's punishment into his own hands.
Brendan Fraser's performance simply cannot be expressed in words. It is phenomenal and heartbreaking. From the first seconds of the film, you know that Darkly is in deep trouble. His downward spiral into psychopathy is throughly creepy.
I'm not sure if Ashley Judd was the right actress for this role. She plays her part well, but someone else probably could have done a better job.
I cannot give an appropriate age for when someone will be able to watch this movie, because it is different for everyone. What I can say is, if you are going to watch this film, you MUST be mature and be prepared to see explicit, graphic images: corpses, stabbing, shooting, self-mutilation.

The most interesting thing about this movie is you can tell the EXACT moment his character turns evil.  I was amazed at Mr. Fraser's turn-on-a-dime acting ability.

There is nothing that would make me suggest anyone watch this. It is clumsy, silly, and tedious. Brendan Fraser is supposed to be wooden--casting coup--but he is more than that, he is patently ridiculous. Absurdity piles up on ludicrousness until the ending, where you just say ""What the ****?""
The Reflecting Skin was not a great film, but was almost interesting. This is just one where you have to wonder about the director. When it was done, and he viewed the final cut, did he say ""Yep, that's exactly what I had in mind""? One hopes not!",1011052800,3,844,4.522875816993464

823684,3,6304256868,"Philip Ridley's first film, ""The Reflecting Skin,"" remains  one of the most stunning, beautiful, and unconventional  movies of the last twenty years (see my separate review).  ""The Passion of Darkly Noon,"" though well worth seeing, is unfortunately much less  successful.
""Darkly"" starts well, with luminous photography and a vaguely dreamlike atmosphere similar to that in ""Skin"" -- although there is no hint of direct imitation; this is style, not mannerism. For two-thirds of its length, ""Darkly"" is fascinating and compelling, though with noticeably less humor than the earlier film.  Where ""Darkly"" falls down badly is its finale, which is all too predictable and action-heavy. The quirky postlude doesn't work at all; the surrealism feels unmotivated and heavy-handed -- Symbolism with a capital S.
Despite the flaws, there is much to admire here.  Ridley is an enormously talented and original director, and one fervently hopes that he hasn't abandoned filmmaking in order to spend all his time on his writing career.",995414400,2,1024,5.36875

It is definetely worth watching especially to break the chain of predictable and pop culture kinds of movies. The overall construction of the movie is certainly different but that's part of what makes it enjoyable. It does take an extreme look at repression but also it runs through many plot possibilities to wonder about. The actions aren't as much of the story as the things underneath the dialogue and setting, the things that they don't show. That is where a lot of the story and interest really is. It less like a novel based script and more like a long short story based one. But as worthwhile as this movie is, I definetely would say it wouldn't be on most people's favorites to re-watch list.

Darkly has never before seen a woman  like Callie and he finds that she arouses feelings in him that he thinks  are very wrong. Later, when Callie's lover Clay returns, Darkly spies on  them.

Viggo Mortensen managed to convey a range of emotions without speaking a word, which justifies my belief that he can do no wrong.
My complaint about the movie is the character Callie. She prances around mostly naked, begins her seduction of Darkly as soon as he wakes up, then tells him not to spoil things when he admits that he is thinking about her. When she claims that Clay's father tried to rape her, I didn't believe it for a second. When she asks Jude if this was her fault, if she had done something wrong, I was screaming YES! You're a effing tease and deserved everything you got. There isn't much more than will set me off quicker than a woman acting like this and then crying rape when the men act upon it.
