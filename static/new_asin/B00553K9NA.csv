4571874,5,B00553K9NA,"I was very happy the Warner Bros has finally released  episodes of one of the best  series of the 1960's.  It was great to hear the theme and see the episode unfold. Even now  more thn 40 years latter the  stories continue to hold the view.  I would agree that  the price for them seems to be on the high side, especially as there are no extras. Hopefully Warner will reduce the  price for  future releases much as Paramount did for Dynasty.",1312070400,4,441,4.280487804878049
4571875,5,B00553K9NA,"Yes, the FBI Season One price is outlandish when compared to other DVD series currently on the market, but it's important to put things in perspective. I consider $2.50 per episode (16 episodes for $40.00) to be a bargain. I remember when VHS tapes of television series first came out: Individual episodes of the old Star Trek series cost $14.95 PER EPISODE in the late 1980s! Considering how inflation how skyrocketed over the years, $2.50 per episode of The FBI seems like a good deal in the year 2011.
  As to the question as to WHY someone would want to spend money on this particular series, you have to watch The FBI to fully understand its relevance in American culture. Well-groomed G-Men in dress jackets and ties going around the country and chasing (literally) down some of the country's most wanted criminals is something we haven't seen on TV since then. Granted, television producers tried to make a comeback in the early 1980s with Mike Connors (Mannix)leading the cast of ""Today's FBI"" on ABC, but Today's FBI didn't have the same wholesome aura of integrity that the original series had with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (One of Today's FBI cast members was Joseph Cali, who played John Travolata's sidekick in Saturday Night Fever, so it was hard for me to view Today's FBI as being as ""wholesome"" as the original series.)
  The FBI no doubt gave the real Federal Bureau of Investigation some good publicity during its run in the 60s and 70s. In today's media, we hear nothing but negative propaganda about this nation's federal law enforcement agents. The FBI (which was based on real cases) helps counter that image. It's too bad The FBI has never made it to syndication like other shows from that decade.",1311724800,20,1717,4.771043771043771
4571876,4,B00553K9NA,"Paid an arm and a leg for it...but was not dissappointed at the product, superbly mastered.  It reminisces of an era when cop-show scripts actually had to be well thought of and developed.  The viewer was left in a state of ever increasing suspense, with a climax at the very end of the episode.  How different were those days from today, where either sex, brutal-exotic-disproportionate violence and obscene language are to make up for the lack of smarts when writing a script (see the latest green hornet movie).  Just a note to the producers:  not a good idea to price half a season this high when effects of a recession still linger.  How about a full season box for season 2?  ...trust me on this, with this quality of show, you'll make it up in volume.  Mannix is a good example.",1311638400,62,785,4.5177304964539005

4571904,5,B00553K9NA,"This show was a flagship production...huge budgets, on location shoots, almost every actor--even the bit players--was originally stage trained, so they all have their little pieces of business that add to the show. Zimbalist (who trained under Eva LeGalliene and was the co-producer of the first opera ever brought to Broadway where it won the Pulitzer) was certainly 'a very good actor despite the meretricious medium of television'[OK, his half-sister Marcia Davenport's assessment but she was qualified to give it] and carried this show as the lead for 9 seasons, probably no-one else could have done it.  His comedic talents and range were never evident here as they certainly were in Sunset Strip, as he was always the Inspector with no humor--it takes a very good actor to carry that type of part for so long.  The voice-over intros are great, and I think the show was stronger with Marvin Miller doing the narration.  Of course the series is dated by today's standards, but most of them from this era are.  The biggest detraction for me (and I am a car collector from way back before it became trendy) is the nonstop appearance of Ford vehicles--there are so many of them and when you watch the shows in sequence, you notice how that Ranchero pickup or 57 Ford sedan(these models appear constantly, only the 63's and 64's seemed to be out of fashion) I actually found it irritating but I'm sure over the years the show sold a lot of Ford cars.  There was a whole stable of character and guest actors who appeared in the QM shows, some of them maybe a bit too often but you really only notice that because you're watching too many at a time.  Many of them guested once a year in several of these shows. Milton Selzer, Malcolm Atterbury, John van Dreelen, Charles Korvin, Ruth Roman, Rhys Williams, Michael Rennie, we will never see this type of slightly quirky indiosyncratic talent again. The book (published 2002) about QM and Quinn Martin is interesting as it explains a lot of the little quirks about the QM shows.  Another plus is the excellent background music which is of a much, much higher order than the typical show of that period or today--and the fabulous theme song by the great Bronislau Kaper!  A truly classy show.  I personally strongly prefer the non-digitally restored format because it preserves the soft film-like feel and the lighting effects which in this show, at least, were exceptionally well-crafted.  To me, the prices are reasonable--when you're finished with them, you can resell them at most book/video resale stores for about 25-35% of the price (excluding shipping) so what's to complain about? There's no point in a business releasing shows for less money than the most they can get.  Period entertainment of good quality at a reasonable price, and prompt shipping.  I'll get the next seasons if they release them.",1363219200,,2855,4.827868852459017

4571908,3,B00553K9NA,"Having only purchased Season 3 Part 2 I have to say that this series for me has not lived up to what I expected from all the reviews read.  So far, I have seen Disc 1 of this series and found little excitement in it. Sure, the acting is good and the series has some very notable actors. The scripts are well written enough, but mostly it is talk during the investigations, probably mirroring real-life.  The quality of the disc transfers are sharp enough and the audio is OK, but the colour of the faces tend to be a bit overdone as do some of the blues.

Personally I think the quality ""Streets of San Francisco"" is much superior in disc transfer and a more actionful show, again with good actors of the time.

4571911,5,B00553K9NA,"This has to be a good show if the man who was the head of the FBI at the time approves it. He even allowed location shooting at the headquarters.
This is one of my favourite shows and I am glad that WB have released the first two seasons as I started watching from the third season on TV  and haven't seen these episodes.
This is the coolest show of the FBI there has ever been. Produced by Quinn Martin. That says it all. I am a big fan of anything this man has done. The episodes were based on actual FBI files. It starred Efrem Zimbalist Jnr who had a major TV hit with ""77 Sunset Strip"" and now had another major hit on his hands. This series ran for eight years. Plenty of guest stars throughout the series. The list would be too long to mention here. Lyn Loring would only appear in season one as Zimbalist's daughter. She would be written out in season two. Stephen Brooks would also leave after season two to be replaced by William Reynolds and in the final season by Shelly Novack.

The shows were all true and had to be approved by E J H. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. was born on November 30, 1918, making him 90 years old. He was born in New York City, NY. He is still alive and I wonder if he knows about this. The price of this needs to come down.

I WOULD BE WAITING PATIENTLY FOR IT. NOW IN ORDER TO BUY IT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY ALMOST $50 FOR IT. AND THAT'S BEFORE ANY OTHER CHARGES, SUCH AS TAX, OR SHIPPING AND HANDLING. ARE THEY KIDDING US?! WHAT IS UP WITH THESE COMPANIES MILKING US AND IN VOLUMES TOO! $50 ISN'T EVEN GOOD FOR A SEASON, BUT IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL THAN BY VOLUME. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THESE COMPANIES? WE ARE IN A RECESSION. PEOPLE CAN BARELY PAY THEIR BILLS. THE MILKING OF THE CONSUMERS WITH SOME OF THESE TV SERIES SHOULD STOP. IT'S RIDICULOUS. THE COMPANY PROBABLY DOES NOT NEED THE MONEY THAT BADLY AND THEY WILL GET AND SATISFY MORE CUSTOMERS BY SELLING IT BY THE SEASON AND AT A BETTER PRICE. THE ONLY OTHER SHOWS I HAVE BOUGHT IN VOLUMES ARE ""THE LOVE BOAT"", ""ROUTE 66"", ""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"", ""DYNASTY"" AND OF COURSE ""PERRY MASON"". THANKFULLY MOST OF THE TV SHOWS I ENJOY ARE BEING OFFERED BY THE SEASON. I WAS SO YOUNG WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS SHOW, I JUST DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT. ALL I DO REMEMBER WAS THAT IT WAS A GOOD SHOW. AND IT'S BEEN SO LONG AND SO MANY YEARS AND HERE IT IS, AVAILABLE AT THIS OVER THE TOP PRICE. I DON'T EVER REMEMBER THIS SHOW BEING AVAILABLE BEFORE, THE WAY ""PERRY MASON"" HAD BEEN. I'M TRULY UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS. I THINK I WILL PROBABLY WAIT UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY IS CLOSE BEFORE I ORDER THIS. I'VE GOT PLENTY OF OTHER TV SHOWS TO WATCH.",1317600000,,2051,4.288659793814433

4571931,4,B00553K9NA,"We were always doing something sunday afternoon and as a kid and I couldn't wait to make it home for ""The FBI"" on sunday nights. I loved the opening credits as it was the first filmed series I saw where the sponser (Ford) got a credit opening the show. In syndication that opening credit is butchered and for the arm and leg one pays for half a season  you get THE BUTCHERED SYNDICATED OPENING. I doubt Ford would mind being advertised and I doubt anyone asked them. I also doubt that anyone who put this package together even saw the original show. Also missing is the weekly introduction of a Top Ten fugitive and if I remember correctly J. Edger Hoover even appeared once in that weekly segment. Has anybody timed these episodes to see if they are chopped? How about a mimeographed (remember those) insert of an episode synopsis and listing of the guest stars. Shocking that Warner Brothers making a 100% return on videos no one will watch on the American Family Channel couldn't do a better job with the presentation. The video quality is good but to say this was ""superbly mastered"" can only mean that the reviewer stating this is wearing the same eyeglasses
he wore in 1965 when this series hit the airwaves. For $29.95 for an entire season I would say this was well bought but as they say in the Warner Brothers cartoons....

4571932,1,B00553K9NA,"This is another classic example of Hollywood greed.

Essentially to get the first complete season they expect you to spend $85.00.

While this was a good series it is also a 45 year old TV series. Very few people are going to be willing to pay that price to see it.

This is not the first time they have tried this on other TV shows. Within a year of seeing people are not willing to pay an outrageous price they bring the price down to a reasonable level.

So do yourself a favor and wait a while.

The price will be about $24.99 for the entire first series by next year.",1316217600,15,572,4.117117117117117

I grew up on this series; every Sunday night the family would be in front of the TV watching this show, we only had one TV in the home back then, you were luck to afford that, so I give it 5 stars even though I have not seen it. Anyway, I am curious to know if they put the ""10 most wanted"" at the end of any episodes. Efrem used to come on after the Epilogue stating that, ""tonight the Bureau asks your cooperation in finding this person, etc. etc"" That was a really great part. It would be nice if they included it. Does anyone who purchased this already have an answer for that. Either way I am getting it anyway.",1313798400,3,664,3.962686567164179
4571938,5,B00553K9NA,"I gave the DVD partial season set a ***** review for the memories it brought back and the wonderful video transfer -not for the criminally high price!

What great Quinn Martin production value... a great patriotic musical store, plenty of guest stars and special guest stars, and plenty of action over its nine season run on ABC. How many people bought Ford Mustangs after seeing star Efrem Zimbalist Jr driving off each week at the end of each episode? And who does Act 1,2,3... and epilogue anymore, with the shows editing?

We all loved and just about saluted this show each time that emblem and fanfare came on. And all the time the FBI was being run by the vilest, most corrupt blackmailer in history. Not to mention all the other numerous foul crimes that bureau director J.Edgar Hoover should have been arrested for by Inspector Lew Erskine (Zimbalist), in the very first episode in 1965.

It was the best propaganda vehicle THE FBI or any other government agency ever had!",1313366400,20,980,4.719298245614035

4571940,5,B00553K9NA,"HEY! All of you complaining about price and 2-part seasons, get your heads out of you VHSs.  This show comes from the day when a one hour drama lasted almost one hour. Today's so called Prime Time Drama averages 40 minutes of actual story time. The rest of the time, 1/3 OF AN HOUR, IS FOR COMMERCIALS.  This series,The FBI, like most others in the early 60s also had many more episodes per season.  This show, the FBI Season 1, has 31 episodes averaging over 51 minutes per episode.  By comparison, the new Hawaii Five-0 series Season 1, contains 24 episodes averaging just over 42 minutes per episode.  That means you get 6 more episodes per season and ten more minutes of actual story per episode.
The drama and the acting were also a hell of a lot better back then.  They didn't need to smear exploding body parts in your face every 10 minutes or show some new sex perversion to keep your interest.

8457474,5,B00553K9NA,"I am so glad that I took this journey down memory lane, with one of my favorite TV Lawmen, Inspector Lewis Erskine of the F.B.I.

There is so, so much more to the character, than meets the eye. Erskine considered EVERY angle and detail of a case, often to Mr. Ward's--and to Mr. Hoover's--chagrin, but they were glad and relieved of that, once the cases were mopped up. And THAT, provided MORE job security, to the various other Departments, of the Attorney General's Office(Laughs!!). He was a wonderful mentor to his junior agents. He demonstrated incomparable compassion towards the criminals who'd merely gone astray, and would exonerate those that deserved it. He even acted as a Social Worker(!), in the episode, ""The Problem of the Honorable Wife"". The Inspector actually seemed to enjoy that aspect of his work on that case, and was ""hands-on"", in liaising with the local Social Agencies and related NGO's, in behalf of a peripheral victim. Every single episode was magical, in watching Efrem Zimbalist Jr., making his character bloom. It seems that a maximum amount of latitude was granted Mr. Zimbalist, in allowing him to create this character. Erskine simply was not the Two-Dimensional ""savage cowboy"", typical of the overwhelming majority of TV/Movie cops. He was urbane, sophisticated, cultured, intellectual,and spiritual/religious, without being mendaciously glib. You got the real deal. Whenever he wasn't involved on cases on Sundays, this man ACTUALLY attended Episcopal Church, probably participating in the running of his chosen congregation. I even imagine Mr. Erskine as being a Baritone/Bass Soloist in his church's choir!

The series was a revelation, in how it nailed down the social, cultural, political, and spiritual issues, with an uncommon prescience that could prophesy how things and events would be happening to this very day, actually quite a gritty ""envelope pusher"", for its day, and it used a formula in its production values, that works--or ought to work--for any sensible classic TV drama--the recent ""J.A.G."", being a fine example.

I miss you terribly, Mr. Zimbalist; you seemed very much an alternate father to me.",1491091200,,2158,5.23121387283237
