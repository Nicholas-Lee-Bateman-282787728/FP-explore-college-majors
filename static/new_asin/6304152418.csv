7862751,5,6304152418,"Anthony Perkins gives a great performance. Total must see for his fans. Sophia Loren gives a good performance as well. Lisa Macklin (Sophia Loren) tells her abusive, emotionally immature husband, Robert (Anthony Perkins), that she doesn't want to see him again. He leaves on a business flight bound for Casablanca. That evening, she is shocked to learn that his plane crashed, with all aboard presumed dead. After his funeral, she finds him at home, having survived the crash. He promises to leave her life for good if she helps him commit life insurance fraud, and she agrees, in order to get rid of him for good. Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren have great chemistry together in this movie.",1514332800,,692,4.872881355932203
7862752,3,6304152418,"Time has been kind to Five Miles to Midnight, a wannabe Hitchcockian thriller that totally bombed when it was released in 1963.  You can see why: the plot is absurd and unconvincing (shady Perkins is the only survivor of a plane crash and tries to collect on his life insurance policy) and most of the ""suspense"" consists of Perkins running in and out of his apartment like a mouse while trying to hide from nosy neighbors and the police.  His performance is weak - instead of menacing, he often comes off as a petulant, spoiled and silly man-child, while Sophia Loren, fresh from her Oscar winning role in ""Two Women,"" is the only actor to convey a genuine mood of fear, guilt and anxiety.  Without her, the film would fall flat, and indeed, the best part of the film comes toward the end, when she has the most scenes.

Despite the film's shortcomings, however, I found myself unable to stop watching solely out of nostalgia. This film really captures the mood and joie de vivre of 1960s Paris like no other film, thanks to the handheld camera shots of Parisian street life, cramped apartments, ironwork elevators and the incessant jazz and French music. The black and white photography is also beautifully sharp and moody. And it's impossible not to marvel at the beauty of a young, vibrant Sophia Loren and handsome Anthony Perkins.

In sum, just forget the plot and immerse yourself in a time and place.",1428278400,,1408,4.684210526315789

7862757,5,6304152418,"Let the viewer beware - don't start this film if you haven't the time to finish it!  I watched only one or two minutes of it on TCM (cable network) and was hooked, even though I'm no fan of Sophia Loren.  The young Anthony Perkins was a typical American jerk trying to live off others, a type found in Europe often enough, and his resemblance to the young Bush Sr. was disconcerting.  That he loved to drink, talk his head off, fool others, lie, and be violent to get his way - all part of his great personality in this film!

Sophia Loren plays the sucker wife, in gratitude to this leech from Wisconsin, for ""rescuing"" her from the hellhole of Naples and moving her to Paris.  She is supposedly gorgeous, with men oggling her, and it's not to her hubby's liking.  She is employed as a fashion assistant to the wealthy women coming to an upscale design house.  Her demeanor is dure, no happy camper, a woman accepting these terms for survival.

When her husband ""Bob"" cooks up a scheme to collect life insurance by claiming to have been killed in the airplane accident which only threw him a distance, he then squeezes her to start processing the documents to get the $120,000, or 60 Million French Francs.  That would be about six houses in San Francisco at that time in 1963, to give you some idea, so the equivalent now would be about $3,500,000.  And this amount she collects in cash (minus 3-4% fee..golly), puts in her purse, and starts driving around in Paris with it, a tied-up bundle.

Every few minutes this film twists and turns, with sharp camera work on the streets of Paris, at the Metro entrances, in the cafes, in the restaurants, with the men milling about smoking, drinking and leering, with the schoolchildren snaking together, with the traffic circulating around the roundabouts, and the inside scenes of the narrow staircases of middle-class apartments, with their slanted rooftops for added thrills.

I think the scenes with the boy, an American neighbor with an absent mother and ""very busy"" father, who becomes interested in the husband, are the best.  He's a smart-aleck  boy of about ten, who's been spying on the man who never leaves his apartment - obviously, Anthony Perkins is supposed to be dead, so he's out of sight all day.

The acting is perfect, with police inspectors, waiters and fellow Americans in Paris, with black and white sharpness.

Above all, the SUSPENSE!!! You can never guess what will happen next!  Every chance encounter can become a prison sentence for either husband or wife, as they enter into major fraud, becoming more and more paranoid over phone calls, doorbells ringing, letters arriving, etc.  Will they be caught?  Will he do something nasty to someone, including really bad violence against his wife?

I leave it to you to see the ending, which didn't surprise me totally, but kept me glued to the set even when I needed the bathroom badly!

If you need distraction, this is it.

Plus, it's Paris, 1963.  Have a look: almost 50 years ago.",1301875200,,3001,4.685114503816794
7862758,4,6304152418,Sophia seemed a little weak in her performance until the very end when she really shined. Perkins was on key.  This was a much better film than BLUES IN THE NIGHT also directed by Anatole Litvak.  Reminded me a lot of Hitchcock`s style.,1280966400,,236,4.465116279069767
7862759,5,6304152418,"this was my mother's favorite movie. we would watch it sometimes back to back, it seemed like five hours.",1261958400,,105,4.578947368421052
7862760,5,6304152418,"Don't you love Anthony Perkins?  He's at his very best in FIVE MILES TO MIDNIGHT, a suspense thriller from the last days of JFK's administration.  He's teamed with his perdurable co-star Sophia Loren, the tasty Italian import whom Tony first met as they played country bumpkins in a ludicrous adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's DESIRE UNDER THE ELMS.  Here Sophia is playing a European woman, which is all to the good, who somehow gets entangled with a mixed up American vet, sort of like Howard Hughes, played by Tony Perkins.  What Sophia Loren doesn't realize is that her husband is crazy, abusive and violent!

Another 25 years later they re-did this movie with Julia Roberts playing the abused wife who fakes her own death to escape from a savage hubby.  Here PERKINS fakes his own death to avoid financial ruin and also, it seems, to be in a better position to drive Sophia Loren insane!  Poor Lisa, who happens to have two high placed pals, Jean Pierre Aumont and Gig Young, seasoned reporters, from whom she must conceal her tale of woe, a tale so bizarre nobody would believe it!  Her cover story isn't very coherent, and no one can figure out why the plane crash that killed Robert might not have been kosher.  Some lovely European vistas are glimpsed out the windows of the hotels and restaurants in the movie.  You can make out Rousseau's grave in one such cutaway.  When Sophia Loren starts falling for Gig Young, while trying to preserve the secret that her husband is still alive, it's another twist of the knife for all concerned!

Nowadays the theme of the battered wife is a cliche, but back then it was scandalous, simply scandalous.  People theorized that Sophia Loren's own marriage wasn't too far removed from the union of Bob and Lisa, and other fans resented the way director Anatole Litwak seems to have directed Tony Perkins to act exactly like Norman Bates, except even more evil.  It's a school of hard knocks for all of them, and only Gig Young seems 100 per cent innocent.  I kept asking myself, if I were forced to make a choice between Tony Perkins and Gig Young, what would I do?  It was this salubrious dilemma that kept me up five miles to midnight.",1126828800,7,2180,4.638020833333333
