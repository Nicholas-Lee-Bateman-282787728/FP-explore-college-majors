8530744,5,B008V0UD1M,"The video doesn't just make it seem too good to be true, but shows small children performing the training!  Dogs love working for treats, and kids love the results.  What a great way to enhance the relationship between my kids and our dog.  Get this video and let Virginia show you how to get the ""sillies"" out of your pet! Results are fast and fun!

8530746,5,B008V0UD1M,"Virginia Broitman has created a wonderful series of clicker training DVDs called the ""Bow Wow"" series. Her latest, the Fido Refined DVD, focuses on teaching impulse control and good manners. Virginia shows the use of verbal markers to shape a well mannered dog.  It is a beautiful example of how to use positive training for positive results!  You can have the well-behaved pet you want and have fun getting there! - Carol Byrnes, CPDT-KA",1355011200,,438,4.905405405405405

8530748,5,B008V0UD1M,"If you have an excitable dog, or adolescent puppy (usually one and the same, lol!), this DVD walks you through several extremely practical exercises. She uses real dogs and owners; this is not some ""looks good when she does it, but it will never happen with my dog"" DVD.

Some of the exercises are:

Taking treats gently
Self-control around favorite toys
Manners at dinner time
Calm and quiet crate behavior
Polite greetings
Calmness before walks

Professionally done, fun to watch (unlike many dog training videos), highly recommended!",1351641600,4,536,5.137931034482759
