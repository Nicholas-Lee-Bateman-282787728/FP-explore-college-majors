6160429,1,B00HETGCDE,"You can read other reviews posted ahead of mine and essentially all of us love the four movie presentations but the packaging leaves so much to be desired.  The pack features one spindle with all four discs compressed together, I'm amazed that each one played well.  But this is no way to treat these wonderful classics and I will immediately relocate each disc to a separate pack in order to best preserve them.  Here's my individual ratings:
Hollywood Canteen - ***** Outstanding, delighted in the love story between Robert Hutton and Joan Leslie though far-fetched
Yankee Doodle Dandy - ***** Another outstanding movie, surely one of the best for the two lead characters, Cagney and Leslie
Thank Your Lucky Stars - **** Goofy but entertaining with Leslie, Cantor, and Morgan
This is the Army - *** Definitely a WWII propaganda film but well done featuring Reagan and Leslie",1437436800,7,876,4.905405405405405
