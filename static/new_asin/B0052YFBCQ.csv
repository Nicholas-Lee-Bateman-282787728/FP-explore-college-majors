away from the worlds troubles and problems produced by our minds. This is a quiet passage of
time with scenes and sounds of nature. It's simple and beautiful, and a reminder to slow down
and be more quiet in our daily lives, if possible. Enjoy ..... !",1443830400,,348,4.5396825396825395
8454805,5,B0052YFBCQ,"I saw this DVD playing in an office waiting room, and immediately thought it would be a great gift for my elderly mom who lives far from us in Western NC. She can pop it in her DVD at home, have it on in the background if she wishes, or use it as a relaxation video. Not able to travel here to visit us anymore, she can enjoy our scenery nonetheless.",1362528000,,350,3.943661971830986
