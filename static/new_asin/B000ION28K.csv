8146943,5,B000ION28K,After getting this early before the expected arrival dates. I was very pleased with the product. I got to relive watching the first five episodes of season 2 of Code Lyoko. A true nostalgic time for me. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of this show and doesn't have this dvd yet.,1476316800,,294,4.267857142857143
8146944,5,B000ION28K,The series is really good and epic. Will there be more series in stock soon? I don't want to start off with volume 1. You cant find them any where else.,1452643200,,152,3.935483870967742

8146946,5,B000ION28K,"The question is not whether this show is amazing or not.  The question is why aren't more kid shows this amazing? The show relies more on the cleverness of the kids involved not on the stupidity of those around them.  The show's plot develops slowly over the season revealing more about how Aelita and Lyoko came to be.  There are several obligatory episodes that serve as fillers that do not really move the plot along, but simply impede the heroes and entertain the viewers.  If you're tired of kid cartoons that entertain you with stupid gags, threads of plot and borderline disturbing premises, give Code Lyoko a try and be ready to follow an actual plot line.",1438560000,,664,4.64957264957265

8146948,5,B000ION28K,"The things that stand out for season 2 is an improvement in the 3D Lyoko animation, and the faster motion of the action. The gang get new vehicles for greater speed, and XANA gets new monsters and a new real world attack. The main arcing strory line for this season will be to discover the origin of Lyoko and of Aelita. I am eagerly waiting for the whole season as well as seasons 3 and 4.",1187308800,2,390,4.144736842105263
8146949,5,B000ION28K,This DVD is a great way to start off season 2 although I honestly would wait for a complete second season set to come out instead of just getting them in individually. I do believe this is the latest DVD they have out of the series so just wait a bit longer to get the set if they have one.,1184976000,,290,3.85
