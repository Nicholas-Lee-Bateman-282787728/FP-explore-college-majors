8478358,5,B005LOBWCK,"If, like me, you were in your teens in the late 50s, enjoying the early (oldies') R&R, and also enjoy a variety of other music styles, such as Country, Pop and maybe even Bluegrass, you will love this DVD (which comes with 2 CDs covering all the concert songs).
Joe Brown still sounds great and so does his band. The mix and variety of musical styles presented adds to the enjoyment of this concert, not to mention Joe's 'entertaining' side. The sound quality of the DVD is great, and the video quality very good.
I was pleasantly surprised to receive the DVD in the NTSC format, not the (UK) PAL format as listed by Amazon.
All in all a 'bargain' of a deal considering all you get for the relatively low price of $17.13 I paid for it.",1459209600,,735,4.333333333333333
8478359,5,B005LOBWCK,My husband and I really enjoy the DVD.  Joe Brown and his group are excellent.  I wish there were more DVDs available of other groups we particularly like.  I purchased this DVD as a present for my husband for Christmas and it was so special to him.,1390089600,2,249,4.25531914893617
