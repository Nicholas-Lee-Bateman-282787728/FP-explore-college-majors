8299266,5,B001EPKKUU,"When I had finished watching this film I felt - to my surprise - shocked. Gotz George did a brilliant job of portraying Mengele and is thoroughly believable as Mengele. Here we see an evil man arguing calmly and intelligently that he has done no wrong. We even see witnesses - medical men - telling the court that they have been practising euthanasia. Peter Rohm, Mengele's defending lawyer, shows how easy it is for a medical man to move, step by step, from being a healer to being a criminal.

Some years ago (probably about twenty years ago so that I don't remember all the details) I was was having a discussion at work with a Czech friend of mine and I mentioned Mengele. My friend said that some years before he had been discussing Mengele with some medical men and that they had told him that Mengele was a bad example to choose as an example of a really evil man. They explained that many of the things Mengele had done were things that medical men might do or would like to do if given the chance.

Some years ago I remember hearing of a baby being bred for spare parts for its sibling. I was outraged that a surgeon in the USA had been allowed to take a chunk out of the new arrival's arm to be inserted into its sibling's arm. What right has anybody got to take chunks out of another human being without informed consent? Moreover, if you read the book  ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctors-from-Hell-The-Horrific-Account-of-Nazi-Experiments-on-Humans/dp/1591810329/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctors from Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans</a>&nbsp;by Vivien Spitz (1 Jan 2005) you see that some of the Nazi doctors were executed for doing things that were the same as or close to some things being done currently by some US surgeons. In ""Doctors from Hell"" there is a ghastly picture of legs and whole arms (including parts of shoulders) lying in a box. As far as I remember these were meant for patching up wounded German soldiers. Clearly the original owners were not asked for their consent to have limbs taken off them.

There has been talk (in the part of the country in which I live) of allowing (by default) doctors to take parts out of a deceased person unless that person has told the authorities quite specifically that he/she does not consent to organs being removed when declared as being dead. As far as I know the current situation is that we have to give specific written consent before we can be used as spare parts, so we are encouraged to give consent in some medical claim forms. One can only hope that we will keep on being encouraged.

Incidentally, in the last few months I heard a claim that one doctor in the country in which I live had stated that newborn babies are not human beings.

I think that this interesting film is not relevant solely to past history but also in certain ways to the world in which we now live. Medical advances may make it harder and harder for doctors (particularly surgeons) to act ethically.",1365984000,2,3022,4.746666666666667
8299267,4,B001EPKKUU,"After the Truth is a very good German movie it is a great work of fiction. The story is about one of Nazi Germany's worst criminals, Josef Mengele decides to turn himself in after 30 years on the run. A young rising German Lawyer is taken hostage and flown to Argentina where he meets Mangele. First the Lawyer and the German Authorities have their doubts that this man  really is Mangele, but after DNA testing and to Mengele's careful explanations, the Authorities agree it is Josef Mengele. Mengele is put on trial in very high security and the young Lawyer is assigned to defend him - with great reluctance!. The Actor who played Mengele in this movie, Gotz George personally financed a lot of this movie to help it became a reality. It is a very good movie and well worth seeing. The young Lawyer is played by Kai Wiesinger who has stared in other Great German mini - series productions such as Dresden and the Ship of No Return ( The Gustloff).",1355702400,,950,4.491329479768786
8299268,4,B001EPKKUU,"A dangerous trip into story telling commences when an American couple wonder: What if the ""Beast of Belsen"", Josef Mengele, PhD, MD had not died in South America in the seventees but had chosen to return to Germany now.  They sell their story to a German group.  Eventually, After the Truth emerges from nervous Germany to acclaim as well as condemnation.  Focusing on the end of a career of perhaps the most dishonored physician on the world's stage required courage to produce. A believable plot as well as very competent actors were also needed.
  That having been achieved, the viewer is left in an unexpected quandry: whose truth will you accept in this day of 'your truth and my truth' relativism?  It turns out that Doctor
Mengele was way ahead of his time.  He had no problem with the Jews nor was he a Nazi, really.
He was just a misunderstood scientist who found himself able to do good in a bad situation.  So what's the problem?  Go and find out.
Curious photographic focus problems will not spoil your viewing.",1244419200,2,1023,4.638888888888889
8299269,4,B001EPKKUU,"It is an excellent movie.  I had to watch it twice, though, because the subtitles were hard to read when superimposed over dark backgrounds. Worth the the effort.",1235260800,3,162,4.785714285714286
8299270,5,B001EPKKUU,"We know that Dr. Mengele died years ago, but this movie does an excellent job of making us face him as if he were still alive today and on trial for crimes against humanity. It is an interesting examination of how human beings treat each other... how we would try such a criminal in a court of law and how he ""treated"" people during World War II (and beyond). Especially moving is how former ""patients"" or co-workers come forward to testify against Mengele. The movie surfaces many interesting moral points that provide important lessons for us today. Note that the movie is in German with English subtitles and is presented with German actors/actresses. Very interesting, especially for those interested in history, justice, and morality.",1234051200,6,739,4.967741935483871
8299271,5,B001EPKKUU,"The Holocaust continues to haunt the world with the unbelievable evil and atrocities that occurred. This is the 'what if' story of Dr. Josef Mengele, the Auschwitz 'Angel of Death'. What if Mengele had turned himself in and was tried for his crimes. Who would defend him? Attorney Peter Rohm (Wiesinger), who grew up in Mengele's home town and is fascinated (obsessed?) with his story must decide whether to accept that challenge. He has wanted to write a book about Mengele but has been holding off because he can't understand why someone who was a former neighbor could be responsible for the deaths of some 400,000 individuals. He wanted to title the book 'One of Us'. In addition to believing everyone is entitled to legal representation, he wants to find out the truth so he accepts. What follows is a sobering and fascinating look at the mind of Mengele as he stands trial. First, we learn he was not alone. In 1920 the book 'The Permission to Destroy Life Not Worth Living' was published and set the course for German medicine for the next 25 years. This is part thriller, part courtroom drama, part moral question. Was Mengele a psychopathic monster or just your neighbor gone wrong? In his closing argument Rohm says, 'The road to Auschwitz isn't so long, as long as you take it one step at a time.' As the end of the film is fading out, Mengele looks directly at the camera and asks, 'Do you see at least a bit of yourself in me?' Don't answer too quickly. A powerful film about evil that still haunts us today. Very highly recommend. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM",1226707200,12,1572,4.67870036101083
