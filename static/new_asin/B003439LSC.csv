8538617,5,B003439LSC,"At the high school where I work, I showed this movie about a family of French Caribbean descent living in France, who decide to go skiing. The movie is a light-hearted and funny comedy, and the response was very positive.  Because of the humor in the movie, we were able to easily discuss issues of race relations in France, comparing them to what is happening in the US.  My students learned that people of African descent living in France, not only have to deal with ignorance around them but sometimes with occasional harshness from non-enslaved African immigrants. They may also be confronted to their own unconscious ""assimilation"".The director of ""La  Premiere Etoile"", Lucien-Jean Baptiste gave himself a role in the movie where he does not shine but is so lovable. The grand-mother in the movie, Firmine Richard, who is a famous French actress from Guadeloupe, might very well be the main character in the movie. La Premiere Etoile is Lucien Jean-Baptiste's first movie, and it made quite a positive  impact in France. It got an award and was seen by 16 millions viewers. I recommend this film which also bears witness to successful interracial relationships and marriage.",1389830400,,1180,4.974619289340102
