7561495,4,B0192PES10,"Grady (Will Kemp) is a hit man, one with a genetic condition where he doesn't feel pain. I watched the film cold so my initial discovery of this was very entertaining. Unfortunately the manufacturer has made it part of its standard description/spoiler. This would have made a great hit-man film in itself, except they opted to semi-cure him while on assignment. He is attempting to kill people while he is struggling with being able to feel pain and pleasure for the first time in his life.

Brinna Kelly plays the required ""hot Asian chick"" in modern films. She is an EMT.

The plot has some continuity issues that most of us will ignore. I would mention them but it would include end point spoilers. There is a cameo by Vinnie Jones which I wish would have lasted longer. Grady has a great sense of humor and his condition is shown as being and asset, which is not really the case, but just go with it, Unfortunately once Grady is ""cured"" the film's mood and comedy falls off a cliff in spite of the meager attempts at EMT humor with correctly placing a drunk passed out woman in the ""recovery position.""

Worth a rental

7561497,2,B0192PES10,"Glib action action comedy about a hit man who feels no pain--the opening sequence where he is being tortured demonstrates about the only situation where this would be a good thing--in real life people with that genetic condition tend to die young.  In any case, the hit man is given a job to knock off some of his associates who supposedly snitched to the Feds but he is knocked out after the first hit and wakes up temporarily able to feel pain (and pleasure) for the first time.

To say that the hit man isn't very smart would be a grave understatement.  If his first mark had actually snitched to the Feds then he probably wouldn't have been completely surprised when his friend the hitman killed him.  For anyone who isn't a complete idiot the first job should have sent alarm bells ringing, but this movie is counting on the viewer not thinking about things too much.

Unfortunately, the cast isn't diverting enough to distract from the fact that the script is rarely funny or believable.  The Midnight Man is attempting a tone along the lines of Lucky Number Slevin or Cat Run but lacks the intricate plotting and rat-a-tat banter of the former and the outrageous humor and likable characters of the latter, resulting in a movie that's glib when it wants to be funny and flat when it wants to be exciting.  There are certainly worst time-wasters than The Midnight Man, which is one of those movies destined to be watched at 3am on cable when you are too tired to change the channel.  Otherwise, The Midnight Man is a slick but utterly forgettable junk-food type of film that might leave you hungry for something better--I'll be pulling out my copy of Lucky Number Slevin.",1456876800,2,1677,4.622895622895623

I was truly surprised by this one, something that doesnt happen very often. While definitely a movie not made on an extreme budget it does offer plenty of action, entertainment, witty dialogue and some decent performances. Thats always nice to see.

Will Kemp stars as Grady, a hitman with a twist. As we learn in the first segment of the movie he has a rare condition that results in his having no sensation of pain. While this could be dangerous for most people he uses it to his advantage taking beatings and torture from his foes without consequence. While it confounds them it allows him the time to break free and complete any and all killings he was set out to do.

Gradys main employer is Ezekiel (Brent Spiner) who sets him on the trail of several men, all of whom have joined together to take him down and possibly Grady as well. He gives him a cell phone, sends him off to the first target and tells him hell give him the next name as he completes each task.

Grady is drugged after taking out his first target by someone who snuck into the apartment before he could leave. That person not only left him unconscious but injected him with a serum that takes away his advantage leaving him able to feel things for the first time, including but not limited to pain. When he wakes he kidnaps an ambulance driver named Zan (Brinna Kelly) to help him deal with some wounds and assist him as the night moves forward. Of course the whole Stockholm syndrome comes into play here as Zan eventually begins to have feelings for Grady.

With each target Grady and Zan not only have to worry about completing his mission but in finding out who was there to target him as well at the first hit. In the end just who is doing what and why makes for a satisfying and completely off guard solution to the mystery.

What makes the movie work is the well scripted writing, giving Grady a wise cracking disposition that has him delivering quips while working at the job of killing people. Kemp does a wonderful job of pulling these off with ease. Not only that the end of the film also results in something so unexpected that it catches you by surprise, something that doesnt happen that often these days. Throw in some short near cameo sequences by action vets like William Forsythe and Vinnie Jones as well as one of the few non-makeup related roles by Doug Jones (who does a fantastic job here) and you have a movie that is a fun surprise to watch.

After first watching I wasn't sure if this was one Id add keep for my collection or not. But the more I thought about it the more I kept holding on to it. In the end I think it is one I may go back to from time to time, I had enough fun for that to happen. If nothing else this is one worth watching. Lets hope all involved move forward in the direction this film is pointing.",1459814400,,2874,4.340782122905028

7561517,5,B0192PES10,"Writer and director D.C. Hamilton pulled out two of the big jewels from his film-making bag -- suspense and dry-witted irony -- and put them to great use in ""Midnight Man."" The story of Grady, a man with a genetic condition that denies him any sort of sensation -- as well as the pleasures and pain that derive from them -- ""Midnight Man"" let's the viewer tag along with with him as a mob assassin on an evening of assignments. But this night was crisis-level killing -- after midnight his employer would become the target. But Grady, a man who felt no pain, was confident he could take out four competitive assassins. Thanks to his gift for feeling no pain -- or remorse or empathy -- he could not even be tortured into revealing targets. The twist comes when he is clubbed into unconsciousness. He awakens to find himself overwhelmed with sensations he had never known, thanks to the side-effect of a new drug administered by an EMT. The rest of the movie comes as he tries to pull off the hits of his life while trying to understand the lightning storm in his body, which includes the mesmerizing scent of a woman.

Will Kemp is a deliciously sarcastic Grady who morphs into a lost child as his relationship with kidnapped EMT Zan evolves. Brinna Kelly's Zan -- short for Alexandra -- goes from fearing for her life to being conscripted by Grady into the evening's plans. Veteran villains fill out much of the cast, with ""Star Trek: TNG's"" Brent Spiner, William Forsythe, and cult-super-creature Doug Jones. Only Forsythe, with his rumbling rock-slide of a voice, seemed conventional as a baddie, which is because he's got it nailed. Spiner is a fabulously wealthy crime boss who deals out death sentences like M&Ms. Jones, who is is 6'7"", and about 155 pounds, is sensational as the spidery killer who derives entirely too much joy from his work. Hamilton has written for Jones before and understands just how his long, lean physical presence can haunt a scene.

The movie is full of twists and turns and, just when you think you know where you are going, stops you like an act of God. A fun way to spend 95 minutes.",1457568000,6,2120,4.605820105820106

Off the top, the 2 leads Will kemp, he is magnificent and Brinna Kelly she is superb steal the show BUT when the other actors come on screen they do there best to take the show which makes for many enjoyable moments in this movie. Grady (Will) is a hitman and has a gift...he feels no pain! Well, someone shanghais him and gives him a shot that will reverse this condition for an unknown period of time. He kidnaps an EMT (Brinna) to help him since now he feels pain. He has a night of hits to da and she has to go with him...but there are twists! I'm not going to say anymore.

8743647,3,B0192PES10,"I rented this film as the actor William Forsythe was listed as the cast, only to be disappointed that he was in only one scene. What a let down. A lot of films do this to bait you into watching the film when in reality it's really just a cameo appearance just to get the film sold. The acting is so so throughout the film and Brinna Kelly's performance as an actor is not up to par, maybe she should stick with producing and or writing, as her performance felt forced and canned. Actors who aren't able to find work, will write their own script and cast themselves as the lead so they can get a film credit. Overall I wouldn't recommend the film if your reason for wanting to see it was because William Forsythe is listed as cast. William Forsythe  is a great actor but he's not the lead.  The Cinematography was shot by Josh Harrison, who has numerous credits as camera operator, 1st & 2nd Assistant Camera and this film marks his move into credited as Director of Photography, which his work in this film shines which proves using experience crew will only benefit the overall look of the film. So 2 thumbs up for the DP. Finally the lead character played by Will Kemp was overall the better of all the cast as he's a bit more season and better actor than most of the other cast, excluding William Forsythe  of course. So although William Forsythe wasn't the lead, the film is watchable even with some of the bad performances so I will leave it up to you to make that choice.",1467244800,,1477,4.344202898550725
