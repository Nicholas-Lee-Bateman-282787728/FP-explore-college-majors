Often when there are overlapping soundtracks, the translators take this as a sign to offer NO subtitles. In what world does that make sense? The amount translated should NOT be inversely proportional to the amount of information given in the original text. I want to make that clear.
Also  I've come to accept that a lot of translators of Godard's films decide (for some reason) to not subtitle the text on the screen as well as the spoken dialogue when they appear simultaneously (when it can evidently be done, and with coherence, since we saw it on the Director's Suite ""Le Gai Savoir""). Usually the dialogue, containing more content, is translated, and this is done most of the time in this DVD. However, when it comes to titles on the image which anyone can guess at translating, like ""Une Nuit a L'Opera,"" or, ""Les Monstres"" (especially when they're accompanied by stills of the films), with extensive narration over the top, they decide here to translate THE TITLES. WHAT. It's insane. What person with their frontal lobe intact would sit down with the job at hand and think that that is the proper decision? I don't usually write reviews but I was so angry I had to write this one.",1439164800,,1289,4.6535087719298245
8193986,4,B000BNEMPU,Not as useful as I had hoped. Most of the images are presented but they are not clearly indentified. At the end of each major section  there is a list of the movie sources and they seem to be in the order that they appeared in each program. I am still translating it so I haven't figured that out yet. Painting and etchings are not identified. Godard's narration seems to have been shortened,1405987200,,391,4.3561643835616435
8193987,5,B000BNEMPU,"I'm a Godard fan, but I don't get these films. I will need to watch them again...and again...to understand them. They are certainly mesmerising, but I feel some commentary on them would help the average viewer, like me, to comprehend them.",1327795200,,239,4.853658536585366
8193988,5,B000BNEMPU,"This French-Swiss production by the French-Swiss avant-garde filmmaker who broke most cinematic conventions, invented a new film language and who became one of the French New Wave`s most influential directors after working several years as a film critic in Gazette du Cinma which he co-founded with La Nouvelle Vague filmmakers Francois Truffaut and Jacques Rivette in 1950 and in Andr Bazin`s 1951 French film magazine Cahiers du Cinma, provides an insightful, critical, political, uncanny, dark, colorful and subjective look at the story of Cinema, the history of Cinema, the histories of Cinema and the stories of Cinema, spanning from its birth and towards the 20th Century. With classical background music from amongst others Ludwig van Beethoven, Igor Stravinsky, Franz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach, himself as the main narrator, actresses like Julie Delphy and Juliette Binoche as narrators, voice recordings of other directors and artists, and through eight fast-paced episodes, Jean-Luc Godard conveys a diverse, picturesque, abstract, unsettling and explicit montage of paintings, images, sounds and movie scenes.

This extensive autobiographical production which began the year after Jean-Luc Godard had finished his 27th feature film ""Soigne ta droite"" (1987) is as much an analytical, existentialistic, surreal and lyrical homage to individual art as a far-reaching and universal memoir of Cinema history seen from the subjective point of view of the director, screenwriter, cinematographer, producer, film editor and earlier film critic who made his directorial debut with the ground-breaking ""Breathless"" in 1960. This close to four and a half hour journey with one of the world`s greatest living directors is like watching a documentary, a drama, a thriller, a film-noir, a horror film, an erotic film, an action film, a comedy, an experimental film and an audio-visual poem at the same time. Jean-Luc Godard`s directing and editing is salient, Herv Duhamel and Pierre Binggeli`s cinematography is varied and the exercise of narrative in this epic work of art is profound.",1298505600,11,2091,5.5754716981132075
