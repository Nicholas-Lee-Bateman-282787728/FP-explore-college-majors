Also to the last gentlemen who was looking for a copy of Splatter Farm you can get it from [...]  It's Todd Smith's company. Todd Smith also known as Todd Rimatti you will remember played Jeremy in Splatter Farm and also graced a few other Polonia Brothers films. Anyway he has a new film out ""EVIL"" and a new company. All I can say is he is a chip off the old block. POLONIA BROTHERS RULE!!!",1065657600,,579,4.123893805309734
7881146,5,6305043124,"I do say.. this is the finest of fine film. I have honestly never seen a better piece of film....ever. This out shines like likes of that movie with that gigantic boat..that ...sinks or something. Anyway, that's not the point..The point is.. this movie has changed my life. I see the world differently now that I've experienced first hand what it is like to experience an alien invasion. It shook me to the core. I must admit, the first few nights I found it hard to sleep, as if I too was in the same situation that Mr. Polonia was in.  Jon McBride and Mark and John Polonia are the most brilliant and creative film making minds of our time. I live for the small glimmer of hope that they may some day write another movie, and my world will be come more vivid and clear once again.",1062028800,,782,4.283783783783784
7881147,5,6305043124,"Everything about this movie was perfect. The storyline, the acting, the filmography, the direction, everything. Santa Claus brings an amazing twist to the tale of christmastime terrors, and the Feeders make some deadly enemies. Their spaceship is also one of the most realistic things EVER placed in a movie EVER. All the actors are truly amazing, too. For example, the woman who lives in the same house as the main guy (wife, I believe?) gives some stunning deliverance of speeches and dialogue, as do the pastor, and the guy who came out of nowhere to swipe a few hundred dollars, only to be defeated by the FEEDER FIGHTERS OF JUSTICE.
Overall, this was a truly wonderful experience, and you must buy the film now.",1009584000,2,716,4.782258064516129
7881148,5,6305043124,"How's it goin. if you're reading this you probably discovered this truly amazing film.  It is so terrible it is brilliant!  My favorite part is the phone conversation between the girls where it seems as if they're no older than 17 yet the first girl who dies has a wedding ring. What the hell was that skeleton doing with that sideways hat on also?  I'm still searching for a point to the movie, some kind of lesson, no results yet.  I've seen it 6 times, the polonia brothers are masterminds. I've got to see feeders 2.  Thanx 4 readin'.  john",976406400,,544,4.39
7881149,5,6305043124,"This movie is hilariously stupid.  I could blow my nose on a film reel and  turn out with a better movie.  I didn't stop laughing, I almost had to go  to the hospital because the laughter was too intense.  This movie costs as  much to make as the price of the video, but it's still worth every cent of  it.  Buy it NOW!",966470400,,319,3.9523809523809526
7881150,5,6305043124,"I saw ""Feeders I"" and I thought it was the funiestfilm ever. I need to see Feeder's II . The aliens looked as though thetin foil was going to come apart. I like the computer animated flying saucer and when the guy sees it and says ""I knew this was going to be a bad day"".  The probe was the highlight of this film. I love the fake head used when they take a rest and it's lying there.. it's SO obviously fake... the jelly looked delicious. I also enjoy the part when the doctor's head is all of a sudden on the floor and then Alien did nothing so that he would be dicapitated. I like the part when the 2 fingered alien grabs the dead fish and throws it back in the river. The sounds FX are great for the alien. The end sucked as did the acting .. this movie was so corny it was GREAT! I believe that this film should truley be placed in the 'Comedy' section of video rental stores. So , if you are feeling down and need a good laugh rent ""feeders"" tonight!",934675200,,956,4.005235602094241
7881151,1,6305043124,"This movie is so bad it isn't even funny.  I saw the first of the ""Feeders"" movies and it was a little better.  Feeders II should be avoided at all costs unless you want to see what a few styrofoam balls  and some model paint can do. DO NOT SEE!!!",915235200,,247,3.9
