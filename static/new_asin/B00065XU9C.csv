Just when I thought the picture quality would be a determining factor in my 1 star rating, I also factored in the sub  par actors, and acting.  The absolutely horrible special effects topped it all off.  I've seen better video games.  Don't waste your time, or money on this bummer.  It was a free rental, but I couldn't stand to watch it.  The picture quality is so bad it is hard on the eyes.",1382572800,,448,4.261904761904762
8039181,1,B00065XU9C,"This movie is horrible. I'm just happy I saw it on my Roku, rather than actually paying for it. There seems to be a story line ... but you can't tell for sure, because the scenes are choppy and the audio is unintelligible. Two actors seem to have remastered their audio, so you can at least HEAR their lines, but of course the dubbing doesn't match at all, so it just increases the cheesiness. Bad graphics, horrible audio, don't waste your time or money.",1236124800,,455,4.428571428571429
8039182,1,B00065XU9C,"I know they had a low budget. A low budget does not excuse this piece of junk. The other reviewer obviously worked for the production. The special effects are some of the worst computer animation and green screen work you are ever going to see. The sound quality is non existant. To call this an indee film is to insult indee films. This film could be entertaining to watch, but go into it knowing what to expect. The other review makes it sound like a decent quality independent film. It is not.

This is amature movie night. Like watching an extened YouTube video.",1199059200,,566,4.495145631067961
8039183,4,B00065XU9C,"An excellent movie with a talent actor, Mike Pringle. This indy flic is produced by pure talent... using some pretty cool special effects.

Seems to be a several 'new' actors on the scene in this one, and despite some minor downfalls not even worth mentioning here, it still is an entertaining movie to watch.
