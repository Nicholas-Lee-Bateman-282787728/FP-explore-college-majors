8657315,5,B00KBERVAW,"I have almost all of Anthony Deluglio's excellent kettlebell DVDs, and this one is my current favorite. The introduction suggests this as a 2x a week workout, and that's understandable, as it can take 35 to 45 minutes including the joint-mobility warmup, and it's a beautiful mix of 14 excellent exercises plus a 3-minute snatch workout. I'm now doing this workout 3x a week and after a few weeks feel stronger and on my way to health and fitness.

Actress Beth Chamberlain accompanies a young Anthony in the exercises, and they alternate leadership of the drills. You can start this with a 10lb KB and work up, among other options. As you get fitter, you can speed through the DVD without the 1-minute breaks by hitting ""next"" 2x on your DVD remote. What a burner!",1504828800,,765,4.666666666666667
8657316,5,B00KBERVAW,"This is a ""do over"" of Anthony Diluglio's previously published ""Art of Strength - Providence"". I've used the previous version for several years and enjoy it.
I don't know the reasoning of his re-doing this work out, but figured it was inexpensive and had the added benefit of an attractive woman being in the video, so what the heck.
It is the same basic work out with some very slight variations. The exercise descriptions are more thorough in this version.

If you have the previous version; you don't NEED this unless you need the more thorough descriptions or you'd like a change of scenery. Ms. Chamberlain is definitely a nice change of scenery.
I found it to be a good buy.",1433030400,6,680,4.619834710743802
8657317,5,B00KBERVAW,"This is a no-frills, straightforward kb workout.  I like both instructors; they are clear and direct.  The exercises are varied.  There are 14 exercises, done for 2 minutes each, with a minute of rest in between, but you can skip or shorten the rest if desired.  Like all kb workouts, the degree of difficulty depends on the weight you use, but I found this to be a good workout when I used a mix of 8 kg, 20 lb, and 12 kg bells.  The music is not so awesome, but you could easily mute it.  Overall, if you are looking for a solid workout, this is a great deal.",1421280000,3,561,4.10091743119266
