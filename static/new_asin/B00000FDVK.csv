7908399,4,B00000FDVK,"Based on the Wildstorm comic book of the same title, Wildcats is the story of two alien races who crash land on Earth thousands of years ago. One race are called the Kherubim. The perpetual 'good guys' of space. Their enemies, the Daemonites, are a more savage race who have been at constant war with the Kherubim for many years. Seeing Earth as a new world to conquer, the Daemonites 'possess' key figures to do thier evil bidding. Only the decendants of the Kherubim (the Wildcats) have the power to stop them. Lead by Jacob Marlowe, owner of Halo International, the Wildcats team members are: Spartan - a cyborg; Zealot - a Coda (Amazon) warrior; Maul - a size growing powerhouse; Voodoo - a novice telepath/telekinetic; Grifter - a sharp shooter; and Warblade - a shapeshifting 'blade'.
Big Takedown - When Halo International decides to revamp their security systems, Grifter suggests an old buddy of his, 'Lonely', take charge of the designs. When the rest of the Wildcats discover that Lonely has a questionable past, the sudden disappearance of a special lens leaves a big question mark on the credibility of Grifter's friend.
Cry of the Coda - Ex-leader of the Amazon-like warriors called the Coda, Zealot must face her past as the Wildcats stumble upon a plot to possibly unite the evil Daemonites with the once noble Coda.
The Evil Within - Voodoo has questions about her past, which the Deamonites are only too happy to try to answer. Will the Wildcats be able to save Voodoo in time to prevent the Deamonite possession of the President of the United States?",1024358400,,1569,4.772058823529412
