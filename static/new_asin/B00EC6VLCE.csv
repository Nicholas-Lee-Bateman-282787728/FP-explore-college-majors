8603682,5,B00EC6VLCE,A very modern twist on a classic horror tale.  This film made for a great stocking stuffer (for adults) this year.,1387843200,2,114,4.428571428571429
8603683,5,B00EC6VLCE,"A throwback to the old-style slasher films of the 80's and 90's. Has an interesting storyline that does not reveal itself to quickly or telegraph the plot points from a mile away. Not as bloody as you might think, given what the film is about.  More character-driven, more plot progression, with suspense and chills. I thought it was a damn good movie, considering it was low budget, and the actors in the movie actually know how to act!

Highly recommended!",1385251200,,458,4.7125

1. Been done before storyline of a group of people (usual mix ranging from highly dislikable to tolerable) having a reunion in a cabin 10 years after a failed prank where they accidentally ran over a friend and buried their crime.
2. Really bad cinematography ranging from excessive panning; weird camera angles (camera at road level showing car tires, etc.); poor framing of subject where they are too close, off center or something is in the way. Bad editing with black screen showing up during editing cuts and tiresome flashbacks to fill in the already obvious story.
3. Actors whose resumes ranges from the following: no previous acting to video shorts to TV background roles to never heard of made-on-the-cheap flicks. Dialogue was seven words said as if just robotically memorized; a pause as camera pans; next person same thing, and so on. Well, I can't blame them for trying it's slightly better pay than standing at a construction site holding a sign.
4. Background music, at times, a few piano keys being pounded and sounded appropriate to a '20s silent film.
5. No subtitles; no special features (what would there be to feature anyway); poor audio level and a hollow sound like they talking in a bottle.
6. It took half an hour into the movie for it begin to make sense. Storyline was hokey as somehow the killer survives being buried under almost two feet of earth (the compression wouldn't have allowed him to breathe or his first breath would have been just dirt). You know who is going to die and of course there will be one or two to survive. Even the killing props were anemic - here a knife there a knife. The usual victims do dumb things to help their demises along. Standard hook of no phone service.",1384128000,3,1811,4.609907120743034
