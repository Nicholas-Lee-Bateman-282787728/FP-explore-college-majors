915906,5,6304706863,"Restored Serials has done it again! An excellent job of re-mastering and superbly done. When watching this serial, we feel as if we are right there in the theatre watching a 35mm print - It is that clear, and the sound is also excellent without any hiss or noise.
Comparing this serial to the one recently released by another company, we would rate this Restored Serials release a 10. Even when watching on a widescreen TV, this serial has been restored full frame so that you can read all the titles and credits.
An excellent job well done! We are looking forward to the next serial release",1262131200,,591,4.5327102803738315
915907,5,6304706863,"This DVD release is SUPERB. I can say that because I have purchased numerous releases for the same serial, including VHS and unauthorized DVD releases. The picture quality is sharp and clear and evidently from the studio masters. The sound is excellent and the detail level is superb.

The serial is chaptered so you can select which chapter you want to watch or you can watch them all from beginning to end without interruption. Old-Time Radio shows are a bonus.

Best part about this release is the liner notes. Authored by Martin Grams, it reveals just how and where they filmed each scene for the chapters, character actors in small roles (such as an unbilled Alan Ladd) and more. I recommend you read the liner notes before watching the serial so you have plenty to look out for during viewing. Makes viewing more fun. (And according to the end of the notes, the author has an authorized book on THE GREEN HORNET coming out in early 2010!)

Overall, quality, liner notes, radio shows, bonus features, this is as good as it gets. If you question whether this is worth the price, take it from a Hornet fan. Grab this.",1246320000,22,1120,4.618090452261306
915908,5,6304706863,I got this on VHS like the first one and am glad this is also coming out on DVD. I think Warren Hull portraies the Green Hornet as well as Gordon Jones did.

Universal movie serial based on the The Green Hornet radio series by George W. Trendle --- The Green Hornet, secretly newspaper publisher Britt Reid, and his Korean valet Kato stop and expose several seemingly separate crimes. This leads them into continued conflict with The Leader, the criminal mastermind behind The Syndicate and the individual crimes --- ""It's gone... like a puff of smoke! I've never seen a car move so fast."" --- The two police officers who are constantly chasing the Green Hornet's car say that in almost every episode. Britt Reid (the Green Hornet) is a rich guy who like Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) has a secret identity that he uses to fight crime --- Through thirteen chapters in this serial The Green Hornet manages to discover and eliminate a number of various criminal enterprises that are plaguing his city. Playing The Green Hornet in this version is a younger and leaner Gordon Jones who was best known for being Mike the Cop on the Abbott and Costello show. Keye Luke plays his sidekick and chauffeur Kato who because of the impending war was changed from Japanese to Korean for this serial.

915910,4,6304706863,"Universal Pictures present ""GREEN HORNET STRIKES AGAIN"" (1941) (300 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- is a 15-Chapter Universal Movie Serial starring Warren Hull, Anne Nagel, Keye Luke & Eddie Acuff, relive those thrilling days week after week venue brought you to the theater, as you were mesmerized in your seat waiting for the final chapter ... exciting action within 15 episodes from Universal Serial, released in October 1940, story thus far, The Green Hornet (secretly publisher Britt Reid of the Daily Sentinel) uses his crime-fighting weaponry to track down the mysterious head of a city-wide racketeering ring ... he is ably assisted by and his trusted valet Kato. ... based upon characters from the popular radio and pulp series, what fate awaits our heroes Hull and Luke in this Universal classic cliffhanger.

A sequel to The Green Hornet, The Green Hornet Strikes Again is a 15-chapter serial that was based upon characters from the popular radio and pulp series. The Green Hornet (Warren Hull) is actually Britt Reid, fearless newspaper publisher, who dons the Hornet's guise to battle criminals that have managed to escape the long arm of the law -- aided, of course, by his invaluable sidekick, Kato (Keye Luke). As Strikes Again opens, Reid and Kato are enjoying a well-earned vacation in Hawaii. Their respite is short-lived, however, as they discover that master criminal Crogan (Pierre Watkin) has ratcheted up his operations and is starting a whole new series of rackets that require the Hornet's attention. After a rough crossing, they begin closing down Crogan's rackets -- including selling bombs to foreign agents -- one by one. Along the way, the duo encounter a number of close calls involving a plane crash, an explosion in a laboratory, a roof cave-in, electrocution, and driving a car into a warehouse loaded with explosives. In the end, of course, the Hornet brings down Crogan and all is once again well. For Strikes Again, Warren Hull, who had already played super-heroes The Spider and Mandrake the Magician, replaced Gordon Jones, the Hornet from the original serial.

There was  no hope to ever see this story again, until Anchor Bay makes a fine print  brought fromk Universals original film negatives.  As for the movie, it's  good but not great. Warren Hull brings more dignity to the role of GH. Keye  Luke is a passable Kato, but expect no  Bruce Lee, Kato rarley gets into a  fight.

915912,3,6304706863,"Warren Hull replaces Gordon Jones in the lead role in this sequel to The Green Hornet.  Hull, who is best known in his role as The Spider and who also played Lee Falk's Mandrake is a welcome improvement for Jones.  Keye  Luke returns as the sidekick Kato.  Y'know next to Clark Kent's glasses as  a disguise, how could you not figure out who the Green Hornet and Kato was.  A white guy and an oriental kinda stands out, huh?  But, despite the lame  secret identity (you have to suspend some disbelief), this is a fair serial  despite it's Columbia label (sorry, but I have a real prejudice for  Columbia serials).  It contains a fair amount of action, a good cast and  some semblence of a story.

7876300,5,6304706863,I enjoyed this serial which was done by Universal Studios in 1940 as a sequel to The Green Hornet serial done by the same studio in 1939.  Gordon Jones was the Star of the first serial and Warren Hull[who became host of a T.v. Show in the 1950's]was the star of the sequel.  The film gives you a lot of action thrills and chills and was as good as the original serial.  Key Luke was the green hornet's valet and sidekick in both films.,1289347200,,435,4.154761904761905
7876301,4,6304706863,"""The Green Hornet Strikes Again"" was released by Universal in late December of 1940, produced after the success of the first Green Hornet serial.  This one stars Warren Hull instead of Gordon Jones, but still with Keye Luke as Kato, Anne Nagel as Lenore Case and Wade Boteler as Michael Axford, directed by Ford Beebe and John Rawlins.  Warren Hull had played a similar character, ""The Spider"" in a 1938 Columbia serial and would do so again in 1941.

The plot follows the same formula used in the first Green Hornet serial, with newspaper publisher Britt Reid battling racketeers, using his secret identity to take direct action against them.  The bad guys perpetrate a series of rackets, most taking only a chapter or two to be cleaned up, rather than having a single large-scale plan.  This time the main bad guy is Boss Crogan (Pierre Watkin) with main underlings Bordine (James Seay), Tauer (Arthur Loft), Dolan (Joe A. Devlin) and De Luca (William Hall).  There is more of a connection with ""a foreign government"" than in the first serial.

The episodic format helps keep the plot moving, though not necessarily in any particular direction.  The schemes and cliffhangers tend to be repetitive, and don't provide any logical path to the capture of Crogan, who is uncovered more-or-less by accident.  Britt Reid sends Axford and Ed Lowery (Eddie Acuff) to investigate the latest known racket, and they encounter the same crooks.  ""The Hornet"" never learns to tie up BOTH bad guys before questioning one of them, nor to watch out for the third one.  And he is remarkably resistant to collapsing buildings and explosions, even by serial movie standards, hobbling away with only a little help from Kato, being back in full action after a few minutes.  None of this would have been as obvious when watched one chapter per week.

This is a serial from Universal, so production values are not what Republic had.  We get the usual tons of stock footage; that in the steel mill even includes a short piece of ""feeding the atom furnaces"" from the 1936 Flash Gordon serial.  Cars drastically change shape as they head over cliffs, similar things happen to airplanes as they turn into cheap-looking models before they crash.  The ""Black Beauty"" looks pretty silly going around corners at the supposed speeds, even if they did add fancy fender skirts.  But on this one Universal did fairly well in avoiding padding, the fights are not deplorable, and the direction takes the story seriously.  The music, in addition to Rimsky-Korsakow's ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" is mostly Beethoven's Coriolan Overture, with Schubert's ""Unfinished"" Symphony, the Scherzo from Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream and ""The Storm"" from Rossini's Lone Ranger Overture.  It is fairly effective, and the type of music favored by George W. Trendle for the radio program -- no royalties required.

VCI's edition on DVD, # 8556, is clear, clean and sharp, and the sound is also good, though 11 minutes and 37 seconds into Chapter 13 it drops out for a couple seconds.  There is a pamphlet by Terry Salomonson and Martin Grams, Jr., who have a book due out in time for the ""new movie"" tie-in; it is hoped they did a better job of proofreading for the book.  Still, a useful item, with a very complete cast list and radio-program sources for some of the chapters.  There is a small ""cheat"" in the restoration; the chapter titles all have MPPDA certificate number 6540, while on the original this would be different for each chapter.  And it doesn't pay to cheat; the ""before"" example in the ""special feature"" illustrating the restoration shows a title with certificate number 6556, from a different piece of film than the ""restored"" example.  I'll bet VCI didn't think anyone would notice.  The other ""extras"" include a ""Bio"" of Keye Luke, a ""Photo Gallery"" and a ""Facts and Trivia"" piece.  Of far more interest are two vintage ""Green Hornet"" radio programs, both somewhat later than the serial and neither embarassing to the quality of the film.  They are in a form that does not allow pausing them; if stopped they must be played from the beginning.  Those familiar with the radio Lone Ranger will doubtless recognise many of the voices.

So a fairly good serial from Universal, transferred from an excellent source print, and with two original radio shows, well worth the asking price.  But don't watch it all in one sitting; one chapter at a time is still the best way to watch serials.",1288396800,2,4457,4.855820105820106
