But I think I speak for ALLLLLLLLL Starcom fans when I say...

BOX SET BOX SET BOX SET!!!!",1130889600,9,157,3.588235294117647
8051418,4,B0007TKP0Y,"This is a series that was very enthralling to me, at first as a child and on though to my teenage years. It was the first TV series I had ever seen that seemed to accept some sort of science fact into the sci-fi equation.

The characters are likeable, the storylines underpinned in real life science (ie. accurate depiction of the gas layers of Jupiter, the temperatures of moons such as Io when in direct sunlight, and so on).",1127520000,5,427,4.405063291139241
8051419,3,B0007TKP0Y,"I used to watch Starcom back in the early ninties.  It was a cool cartoon ahead of it's time animationally speaking, but the story lines were kind of star trek rip offs.

This dvd has three episodes on it

1. Fire & Ice

2. The caverns of Mars

3. Nantucket Sleighride

The transfer to didital was  not the best , but could of been worse.  Ok sound and it's only 2.0 dolby digital no other channels.

I hope they release the other episodes soon.  I have 13 others on vhs that I taped of tv in 87/89 and I'm in the proccess of  transfering them to DVD myself .

I love that they are finally release 80/ early 90's cartoons on dvd. Tranformers is already out.  And they stopped G I Joe at season 2 .  The 80's ruled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1114819200,10,735,4.194244604316546
