Robert Bakker, Jack Horner, Philip Currie, they are all here and all YOUNG! To this day this video excites me and further adds to my passion for deep time. For those interested in dinosaurs AND the history of paleontology this is a must for your collection. You also might want a VHS to DVD converter since the 80's are long gone.",1478736000,,503,4.195876288659794
7820195,5,6302038685,"This is a great special if you can find it, from the renaissance era of dino-paleontology. Doesn't exist on DVD yet unfortunately. Robert Bakker is in his prime and very entertaining, so is the great Jack Horner.",1460332800,,212,4.756756756756757

It arrived promptly-within 3 to 4 days-and in perfect condition. I have heard him listening to it at least once if not twice a day, and he has even memorized quite a bit of the dialogue. Thank you for having this product available! I just hope it becomes available in DVD soon-the way Jimmy continually watches this video, I'm afraid he's going to wear the tape down! lol.

7820198,5,6302038685,"Even though there are very few animations of dinosaurs, this is still an interesting look at the modern ideas of dinosaurs back when they were brand new:  bird-relations, warm bloodedness, herding and migration, etc.  People who've seen more than a few dinosaur docs will see some familiar faces.  Jack Horner, Robert Bakker, Phil Currie, and the late Stephen Jay Gould are all here.

This was the first documentary about dinosaurs that I ever saw.  My grandpa taped it off PBS when I was very young, and everytime I went to see my grandparents, I'd always watch it.  Now I have it myself, and it never gets old.",1139702400,,612,4.672897196261682
7820199,5,6302038685,"What a wonderful look at the science of dinosaurs.  New theories mixed with old theories, some of it even surprising to newcomers to the subject.  I used the video in teaching Earth Science & Geology.",1132444800,,200,4.685714285714286
