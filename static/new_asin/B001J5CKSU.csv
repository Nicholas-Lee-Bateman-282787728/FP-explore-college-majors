3651881,2,B001J5CKSU,An ancient haunting legend takes its toll on modern visitors to a rural wooded location.  The actors spend too much time frozen in fear while a guy in overalls and a women with a big hole in her mouth reek havoc.

3651882,1,B001J5CKSU,"Sorrow Creek has a number of legends attached to it that are explained in a very mundane fashion in the film. Kayla (Freya Ravensbergen) our token eye candy and her sister Jesse (Christina Caron) head off to a cabin near this area along with two male friends. Then weird things happen.

The film quality was poor. It looked like it was 1970's VHS. The bright daylight scenes were out of focus. Stephen Walker who played Daniel Fields can't act, and that is putting it nicely. The end scene with Kayla was filmed similar to a found footage scene with the camera laying on the ground. Why? Who knows. The film has a few decent horror scenes, but needed to tie the story together better to make them meaningful. The lack of a good story made good scenes boring.

3651883,2,B001J5CKSU,"First I'd like to admit I stink at writing reviews. I know that however I wish to save you some time and money.
I started watching this movie and simply couldn't stay focused due to the boring slow  moving story. I stopped watching around 15 minutes in. I then started back up the next day as I paid for it and I was desperate to watch something. I made it to 45 minutes out of the 113 total and stopped again. It's slow moving, I don't care about the characters or have a need to find out what's going on. I suspect I'll try and finish it tomorrow, as I paid for it, but I suggest you skip this one unless you are really desperate to watch something. It's very very slow moving and the things that do happen are so far between with the filling being the characters just verbally stressing out over what happened. That would probably happen in real life but it doesn't make for good entertainment.",1356912000,3,897,4.276470588235294
3651884,1,B001J5CKSU,"Just viewed this movie and yes, it's trying to be a little bit Blair Witch and little bit Evil Dead.  It ends up a whole lot of nothing.  The movie clocks in at 74 minutes.  Much time is spend with the 2 leads curled up in each other's arms sobbing, repeatedly asking ""why, why is this happening?!""  These are definitely not people you want around you in any kind of emergency.  The shocks are minimal and so is the gore factor.  The ""suspense"" building up in this movie is just the audience desire to something ... please God, SOMETHING happen!  And when it does, it has no effect at all.  My only ""sorrow"" is the waste of money.",1338336000,3,630,4.279661016949152
3651885,2,B001J5CKSU,"I'm all for suspense-building and some good creepy things happening but there's just not enough of this here.  I found the first half pretty boring - mostly two characters sitting around being scared after a couple of things happen. On the plus-side, the female lead's fear is mostly believable but her hysteria just goes on way too long. Things finally get going and the story becomes a little more interesting but the overall effect is only so-so.  I'll watch it once more, in case it improves the second time around (as many movies do), but something tells me this DVD will end up in my next box of donations to the Salvation Army.

3651886,4,B001J5CKSU,"This short but effective micro budget horror feature kept me in suspense.  The set-up was extroardinarily well done for a micro budget pic.  The acting also was exceptional for this type of film.  I am not crazy about four letter words, as they almost always guarantee an ""R"" rating, but in this particular film, they seemed to work.  Certainly better written, acted and directed than the infamous ""Blair Witch.""

3651887,2,B001J5CKSU,"I watched this trying to find a truly good, spooky horror movie. I was pretty disappointed here. For starters, it looks like it was filmed on someone's home video camera. A personal pet peeve. The acting was terrible. It does look like a student film, but not a good one. The general plot failed when the action started to happen and the kids didn't leave when they had ample opportunity and wrote in pathetic reasons for why they wouldn't. It wasn't just like your typical bad decision making from a teen scream movie, it was really bad writing. Bad sets, bad directing, awful special effects...

I'll give it this, it did have one or two scenes with some mild creepiness. Overall, I wouldn't waste my time, and its only a 1hr 15m movie.",1267315200,18,738,4.548872180451128
3651888,4,B001J5CKSU,"For some reason,  there is a very cheesy, poorly acted prologue and epilogue around this spooky little low budget piece.  With a feel like a well made student project,  the main picture delivers several good scares in a nicely acted slightly gory well paced film.  I picked this wanting some horror-flick background noise for an afternoon working at home,  and found myself repeatedly distracted from my work and drawn into the movie.

3651930,3,B001J5CKSU,"I have to say that the movie could have been way better in many ways. The video,& the characters acting was poorly directed along with the writers decisions in what the actors do,& say. I agree in another review posted,that it seems as if it was done by students in all ways. This movie isn't very long-not counting the credits its roughly about 1hr 15min long. If the writing was done better along with the director and producers decisions in what the characters do,say,decisions made even,& the whole concept of the movie altogether. Though the concepts written in the movies description sounds like it would have been a decent,albeit,horror movie,but its a B- movie at best. Luckily at this point Im getting used to B- movies being made anymore,as theirs in my opinion,not many good movies made in the Sci-Fi,Horror,or Thriller type of movies I tend to like most,even other genres of movies released are beginning to be less and less great as well. Just the occasional good rating of movies are being made anymore.
  Though,I will say that I also have seen movies that are almost identical in story line,even what the actors do,yet sadly aren't remakes as we are beginning to also see done more often even. Some are well done and maybe even done better than the original(but not due to the fact we have CGI type of things available now),and some remakes are done just as bad when in the wrong hands & done by sadly done acting. Which is 1 of the reasons I decided to rate it 3 stars,even though it could have been better And scarier if it were in the right hands to of made the movie better. Granted I do take into account that the actors aren't all terrible,and sometimes I take into consideration they are being paid to be directed in the way that the directors & producers want them to. Makes me wonder how many actors over the years thatd done movies such as like this,& it ended up costing them possibly better careers in the movie business,all because they took a job to do movies that turned out really bad,with bad reviews,& cost them better chances possibly...
  Since this movie was a free one included w/Amazon Prime,it didn't cost me extra to watch,but the overall concept isn't bad and could have done more w/the plot behind the title and the movies beginning to at least show more into it,leading up to the present. Unless you have Amazon Prime as well,it won't cost ya extra to take a chance on maybe watching this movie,though I wouldnt pay more than $2,And thats pushing it for price honestly in even asking customers to pay more for such a short movie....",1436659200,,2576,4.605664488017429

It has the same camera action as Paranormal Activity. I didn't think the acting was all bad either and the story line could have been better detailed.

3651964,4,B001J5CKSU,I chose four stars because I thought that at times the acting was a little overly dramatic. A little too much screaming and very loud crying . All and all a good fright flick though.,1392595200,2,182,4.228571428571429
3651965,1,B001J5CKSU,What the!!!!!# the acting stunk the plot was worse. I want my money and time back this film is a complete waste of time and money. Who made this ah I'm so peeved right now!!!! GARBAGE,1392508800,,183,4.111111111111111
3651966,3,B001J5CKSU,"While I have definitely viewed worse films, this was not well executed as others have pointed out. The story was a good idea. I liked the lead in to a possible ""investigation"" on the area. I also liked that there was a bit of character development between the four people. I thought there were some decent thriller-style scares with some variety in the types of scares rather than the continual loud-noise types that I often see low-budget films do. I thought that the scenery was appropriate and the camera angles and scene choices were well thought-out. I would say if you go into this movie anticipating that it resembles a well done amateur film you will enjoy it. Of course, I am still looking for a good scary movie with less people being completely irrational in light of a serious threat.

What I would have liked:
The four main characters did a decent job of acting. The policeman and investigator could have done much better. I also feel that the lead in and ending felt thrown together. A weird extra. I think that those would have felt more appropriate for a kind of flash-back re-enactment during the investigation or maybe the movie started with the four and then there were a few scenes at the end with little to no dialogue showing the police picking up the pieces and finding the documents in the house.

*SPOILERS*
My final little tidbit: Who on earth sees someone mauled almost to death and decides to drag them inside and up the stairs to lay them on a bed with no phone lines or medical knowledge instead of plopping them into the car next to them and driving to the hospital? Bear, Human or Ghost, the girl should have gone straight to the car and to medical help. And that was only the third stupid action in the first 30 minutes or so. Why do horror movies always equate to ridiculously irrational thought processes leading to a horrifying death? End rant.",1386720000,,1880,4.57566765578635
3651967,1,B001J5CKSU,"Dismal homemade effort sandwiched between the bookends of a conversation between The Law and The Folkorist - something that really couldn't happen ever.
Starts out dreadful and goes steadily downhill. The acting, such as it is, is dire; likewise, direction and paper-thin story. No credible, or even interesting characters. Any gravitas they may possess is lent only by the fairly liberal F-Bombing. It's shot at night on somebody's Best Buy camcorder so they never have to worry about lighting. The characters wander around, dropping one by one, until the story finally drops to the floor breathing its last. Thank God, there are only four of them. This drivel might have gone on even longer than the eternity it felt like it took.
I put this on to kill some time but I completely lost interest about ten minutes in. I would have done a whole lot better staying in the shower until it ran cold.
Absolutely horrible. There's no talent involved here to call it a waste of such. It's just a waste of time. On everybody's part.

3651969,1,B001J5CKSU,"The legend of Sorrow Creek isn't really a legend, at least not one that's explained to us. The two girls in the movie apparently grew up playing at their grandfather's house in the summers. Yet they too had never heard the legend of Sorrow Creek. Which apparently according to some historian is told to all children in the area by their grandfather's to keep them out of the woods. Guess this grandpa dropped the ball on that one since the girls go happily trotting into the forest.

The filmmakers tried to set up a scary story about a haunted village, but failed miserably. They never gave it enough backstory to allow us to understand what was going on. And they never developed the characters enough to make me care what happens to them. It did have a few scares, but nothing very worthwhile. And the plot never really goes anywhere.

3651972,1,B001J5CKSU,"I like B horror movies. I even like C, D, E and F horror movies. This one was somewhere around Q. This was clearly made by some college kids... Or maybe even high-school kids... On a budget of around $49.95. I'm all for low budgets; ""Evil Dead"" and ""Phantasm"" are classics, and the recent ""Yellowbrickroad"" was one I really liked... But there are no IDEAS here, in the writing, the cinematography, the effects, or the acting. (Or, in the case of the two guys at the beginning and end who provide the framing story, the ""acting."") I will give a qualified thumbs-up to the sound design... While the musical themes aren't much, the ambient sounds are appropriately creepy... Though they sometimes make it hard to hear the poorly-recorded dialogue.

So if the fella who made this reads this (which wouldn't surprise me), I'm sorry. I really give you credit for getting this finished and onto Amazon... But you really need to continue your film-making education and find out more about what makes movies WORK.",1372204800,12,1004,4.7701149425287355

3651974,3,B001J5CKSU,"I stumbled upon this little surprise package on Amazon. Truthfully I wasn't expecting much, perhaps because I'd never heard about it or any of the actors. It started out with an obvious sense of being low budget. The acting is awkward, the dialogue is forced and the laying groundwork for a plot seems convoluted. Surprisingly, as the film continues I found myself being drawn in as to the mystery surrounding the young people who came to enjoy a peaceful weekend where the girls had many fond childhood memories. As the story develops so do the events that, quite frankly, caught me off guard at times as well as left me relating to their fears and situation. That is the best any decent scary movie can ask of it's viewer. Low budget or not. So without spoiling what happens in the end, I agree it is low budget, it's ending does not hold up to the prelude, but I can honestly say I was unnerved several times during the movie. I felt the primary actors were more than adequate and I would not hesitate to watch it again. All in all, I would encourage anyone who enjoys an occasional low budget, fun, scary movies to give this fun sleeper a chance. Now, also in fairness, if you're someone who feels low budget, slight cheese balls are a waste of your time, then please pass on this one. It will not meet your standard and you will never get back the time in your life you spent watching it. That is true of any movie that bombs for you. Otherwise, take a rainy Saturday, get some popcorn and watch this movie and decide for yourself. I don't think you'll regret it.",1368316800,2,1568,4.429065743944637
3651975,1,B001J5CKSU,"There are a couple of really nice shots in this film, but aside from that there isn't a whole lot of redeeming qualities.  It looks like a halfway decent student film (which, if you watch it with that mindset, it becomes better).  Poor lighting, poor camera work, poor editing...

Now, the real point of this review.  If you want to see this film, I recommend the 8-film Midnight Horror collection.  For half the price, you also get: Prom Night, I am Omega, Below, The Evil Bong, Decadent Evil, Meridian, and Demonic Toys.  Some of these have small cult followings, and some of them are genre classics.  I don't feel that this movie is good enough to warrant a $10 dvd purchase (sorry filmmakers) but the $5 8-film collection is absolutely worth it.  Buy that instead.  There are a few other dvd collections I have seen that included this, but I only own the one mentioned above.

2 stars because since it's obvious that this is a z-grade, no budget film.  A quick google search tells me that this is the only film the director has made.  If one of my friends or somebody else I knew said ""hey, I made a movie, check it out!"" and showed me this, I would be pretty impressed.

All in all, get the Midnight Horror or other similar collection if you want to see this, and when you do watch it, just don't compare it to higher budget films.",1364169600,,1336,4.404081632653061

Kayla refills her water bottle while her sister does etchings/rubbings of the trees. Kayla is disgusted by the water, even though her and Jessie used to drink the stream water as kids. So they are visiting Kayla and Jessie's childhood home or cabin... i think Cabin. It's a nice cabin, the phone lines are knocked down because of some trees years upon years ago. So Jessie decides to stay in the forest to do some etchings near some abandoned rocks that used to be a house. So they all agree to head back to the cabin except Jessie, who says she will come back later and call if she needs anything.
Hours go by, and it's getting dark and they just now realize they lack cell service too. Suddenly they get a phone call on the cabin phone that, again, i stress, the movie stresses, does not work. It's Jessie, screaming that they have her.  They all get creeped out, and decide to leave in the car and go for help. Toby forgets his heart medication, and Dean forgot the keys, so they go to get those things, when they see some stuff in the shadows.
I'm not going to say anymore, because if you made it that far you can watch this movie. It's not good, it had some potential, somewhere in there, but it's not edited or written well.",1458432000,,1791,4.391566265060241
