4861082,3,B005RJ6A5S,There was nothing in the DVD that had not been told in the past.  Being a true royalist I still enjoyed the footage.,1366243200,,116,4.043478260869565

4861084,5,B005RJ6A5S,"I love everything I have purchased on William and Kate, and all of the Windsors.  Kate and William are the epitome of class, and are a wonderful reflection on the Queen and all things British.",1347580800,,192,4.485714285714286
4861085,3,B005RJ6A5S,"I have seen several DVDs of archival footage focusing on the monarchy, and this one does not really do it for me.

Although the footage of George V's jubilee and funeral were interesting, I did feel that this part went a bit long.  (Maybe somewhat because the video quality is predictably subpar.) There were a lot of crowd shots, few close-ups and of course no sound.  I felt the same way about the footage of George VI.  Although there was some live sound, the coronation in particular was very slowly paced and could have used a bit more editing.

Proportionately, the George V and George VI segments are quite a bit longer than the material about the current monarchy (or maybe it only seems that way).  There is some cool footage of Elizabeth's wedding and coronation, although the latter was a bit spoiled for me after the lengthy treatment of her father's coronation.  The weddings of Princes Charles and Andrew and Princess Anne are given a quick rundown, Prince Edward's is not shown at all.

It is quite misleading to show Will and Kate's wedding on the cover of the DVD, since the actual documentary ends with their engagement.  (There are some wedding shots in the extra features.)

This video feels like it was kind of slapped together in anticipation of the Queen's jubilee.  The production values are not nearly as good as on Monarchy:  The Royal Family at Work.  I love a good British monarchy documentary, but this one is not the best.",1329264000,10,1452,4.669291338582677
4861086,5,B005RJ6A5S,This Doc is well done and had a lot of footage that I hadn't seen before. It's a great addition to my collection and I recommend it to all royal followers.,1326326400,7,155,4.032258064516129
4861087,5,B005RJ6A5S,"This DVD offers video coverage of major monarchy events from the King's Jubilee in 1935, with British narration of the times, to the 2010 marriage of Kate and William. It is quite educational as well as nostalgic seeing the same first-hand coverage that the British people watched on their TV once it was available. You are seeing footage as it was capable of being done in the years of the events, so expect some black and white footage in the earlier segments. The stories begin by explaining why the royal family is now connected to the Windsor name, the first new fact I learned.

SUBTITLES--The programing does have SUBTITLES.

Bonus material includes the King and Queen in Washington, Passing of a Great Monarch, Wm & Kate exiting the Abbey as well as the Buckingham Balcony scene after the wedding. There are 9 text bios of a variety of Windsor monarchy figures. Also a viewer's guide booklet with more bonus to read. The family tree inside the booklet really helped kept the monarchy names, eras, and relationships in their proper place. Very helpful.

If you find the British monarchy interesting, this is a good educational video form of seeing what actually took place at specific moments in history. I also recommend a DVD called ""The Royal Wedding"" if you want more, cheaply, about the William/Kate wedding. Another outstanding set is ""Monarchy Complete Collection"" as entertaining as it is educational done in a dramatic mode. ""The Windsors From George to Kate"" is strictly archival footage with the audio of the film, like stepping back in time and viewing the events from the grandstands, like the British commoners. Lady Di is covered, but not in depth.",1321574400,22,1670,4.893992932862191

8484314,5,B005RJ6A5S,"Nice revised and updated recopy of a two tape VHS version that was issued several years ago.  Show how the British monarchy is masterful at reinventing or even coming up with entirely unprecedented ceremonies (i.e., Princess Diana's funeral), and make it seem as if that is how it's been done for hundreds of years.",1408320000,,315,4.833333333333333
