7830154,4,6302717396,"This is an odd one: shot in London, but with a primarily Spanish and Spanish-speaking cast, about the effects of abortion on the life of a young woman (Consuelo Ferrara) who gets gang-raped by a bunch of hoodlums/street bums/drunks (in a scene SORT of like what's depicted on the video's cover art).

The movie opens with a lengthy (5+ minutes) credit sequence in which real women on the street are asked their opinions on abortion. The story then moves into a fictional narrative centered on Ferrara, who appears fully nude in numerous scenes, including the aforementioned gang rape, as well as hot sex scene with her boyfriend and then, later, topless on a surgical gurney (not so sexy, despite the director's insistence on filming the doctor's CPR efforts with almost nothing but close-ups of his hands on Ferrara's shapely bosom).

The MexCinema tape is (surprisingly) letterboxed (~1.75:1), though it is also in Spanish language only, with no subtitles, although some of the English language dialogue is subtitled in Spanish.

Not the lurid exploitation film the cover art makes it out to be (though it certainly has some elements that lend itself to that classification), this is more of a romantic-tinged melodrama examining one of the most controversial issues of our time (and of the time three decades ago), while more than infrequently lapsing into passages of questionable taste and sleaze (not that I minded, obviously).

Featuring supporting work by Spanish 'Lolita' Sandra Mozarowsky (""Hitler's Last Train,"" ""Night of the Seagulls""), who committed suicide (or did she..?) a year after this film was released.",1321660800,,1623,5.159695817490494
