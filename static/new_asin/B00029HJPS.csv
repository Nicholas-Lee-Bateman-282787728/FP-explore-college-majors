2069548,1,B00029HJPS,"I was really excited to see this document on amazon instant video as some colleagues and I had been discussing this subject recently.

The first thing I noticed was the poor 4:3 aspect ratio, and almost crackling audio.  The media itself seems to have been converted directly from video, as the screen has a tendency to jump, as if the magnetic heads of the video player were not aligned correctly.

The score draws attention to itself rather than add an enhancement, it would have probably been better not to have any at all.

Worse yet is the narration.  The reader seems to be reading in a permanent sneer, and comes off more like he's reading for a propaganda film rather than a documentary.

The content itself added nothing to the already sizable inventory of WWII documentaries existing already.  If you haven't already, skip this and go directly to the Battlefield series and watch the episodes on Russia.

Not only do you get a much more detailed and academic piece, but narration by the very able Timothy Pigot Smith is hard to beat.",1348272000,4,1043,4.6923076923076925

2069551,4,B00029HJPS,"Good narration (though occasionally lapsing into a ""sarcastic"" tone), very good footage, accompanied by arguably the worst score ever to be written for a film!

2069553,2,B00029HJPS,"Perhaps this is more a case of high expectations than a poor product, but I was disappointed in this DVD.  Let's start with the packaging; the case and sleeve art give the DVD a ""home-made"" look.  Also, I thought this was a new documentary; on the contrary, it was originally produced in 1995.  The narration is overly dramatic and the text adds nothing in the way of increased knowledge on the subject matter.  The music is a distraction at best and annoying at worst.  The one redeeming quality and why I did not rate it 1 star: there are MANY images and film clips that I have never seen in any other documentary covering the German/Russian conflict, and I have watched hundreds of hours on the subject.  Overall, as a history lesson or for sheer entertainment value, I cannot recommend this product.",1098230400,14,803,4.619718309859155
2069554,5,B00029HJPS,"One of the standard jokes on the television comedy ""Hogan's Heroes"" was that if Colonel Klink or Sgt. Schultz were not good, they would be sent to the Russian Front. As a result of the Iron Curtain descending upon the continent of Europe after World War II what we knew about the Eastern Front and the savage confrontation between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was most informed speculation and supposition. This three-part documentary on ""The Russian-German War"" features captured German and Russian footage, most of which had never been seen in the West. This fascinating documentary gives us new insights into a clash that last almost four years and which saw an average of almost 18,000 people die EACH DAY.
""The Politics of Fear,"" the first episode in the series, looks at the uneasy alliance that existed between Hitler and Stalin after their division of Poland. Having conquered France, Hitler and his generals look towards the East, opening up a second front that would ultimately prove to be the undoing of Nazi Germany. ""The Killing Ground"" starts with the brutal winter of 1941, the worst in well over a century, and ends with the Russian army forcing back the Nazi invaders, despite horrific losses. Hitler ordered his troops to fight to the last man, refusing to allow them to retreat. However, his orders only resulted in entire Armies being lost. ""Breakout to Berlin"" starts with the defense of Stalingrad in 1943 and the successful race by the Soviet Army to beat the Americans, British and French forces to Berlin. When Stalin's men found the charred remains of Adolf Hitler, you can truly say the Russian-German War was finally over.
Admittedly, this documentary series will have little utility for history classes unless they are specifically studying World War II in its entire scope. The Allied war effort is almost tangential to the story being told her, which is the horrific death match between the two great evil ideologies of the 20th Century. ""The Russian War"" brings home the grim reality that 1 in 10 Russians died during this war. The opening sequence of ""Enemy at the Gate"" only hints at how great of a butcher's bill resulted from this part of the war. The narration for this series is provided by actor Douglas Rain, from a script by producer Jerry Lawton, with music by Rick Hyslop. This documentary will prove fascinating to any devout student of the Second World War. For the rest of us, we will simply always remember that there was nothing funny about being sent to the Russian Front; no matter which side you were on.",1088294400,32,2560,4.83371298405467

2069577,4,B00029HJPS,I've watched most of the WWII documentaries that I can find and this one was interesting. There was some new footage that I hadn't seen before and the music in the background had an eerie quality that mad the footage even more disturbing.  After seeing so many other programs  I'm shamed to admit that I have become used to seeing such slaughter and carnage but when I watch material like this I try to remember my 9th birthday which I spent touring the concentration camp at Daccau. It left an indelible impression on me that has served me well over the years.  I'm still awestruck at how frightening it must have been to live at that insane moment in time.  That generation will soon be gone like the WWI vets before them and I feel like we have learned nothing from their sacrifices.,1428192000,2,786,4.475524475524476

2069590,4,B00029HJPS,"This seems to be a documentary made for the CTV Network (Canada) in 1995. Despite this, the audio quality is rather horrible and made-up exclusively of black-and-white film taken during WWII. This gives it the ""feel"" of something made during the 1950's or 1960's. Since it was made for old-style (NTSC) TV, you will see a ""square"" picture, even if you have an HD monitor.

I liked the narration, but the background music is pretty horrible. It sounds like two deaf people playing a piano and a couple of drums. Just a bunch of random notes strung together for hours on end. It definitely got on my nerves by the end, especially since the audio seems to be in mono and the recording quality is so poor.

Despite these shortcomings, the script is well-written and matched with some excellent footage, much of which I had never seen elsewhere. I've seen hundreds of hours of documentaries on WWII, so it is rare for me to stumble across anything with original content. That being said, the story is definitely told from the perspective of someone on the winning side of a war, rather mockingly portraying the Nazi's as fools with the clear benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

Please keep in mind that this is not a WWII documentary, but a documentary about the part of the war between the Russians and the Germans. I mention this because if you do not keep that in mind, you may be surprised at how fleeting the mentions of British or American involvement in the war are. Since most WWII documentaries cover those areas pretty well though, it is nice to see this particular aspect of the war covered in more depth than is usually the case. When you consider that the Russians lost far, far more of its population to the war than most other countries combined (an estimated 20 million dead, although it will never be possible to ever learn the true number) this is definitely a part of the war that deserves far more attention than it has historically received in the West.",1413936000,2,1962,4.616045845272207

It started in 39 when he failed to Invade England and waited on the worthless Goeing to win the Air War.  His hesitancy lost it again in Russia when he turned his Panzer Generals away from their original objectives.  Hitler was a megalomaniac whose fears were fueled by his use of drugs and his diseased brain to map out strategies that were doomed to fail.

In fact, I have read much on the war on the Eastern Front between the Third Reich and the Soviet Union.  This two disc set tells that story in a most graphic and prolific way.  The story is shown through original footage of the events that took place as Hitler ordered his army to destroy Russia.  This documentary has somehow obtain footage not normally shown of the graphic horrors of combat between Russia and Germany.  For students of history or military ""buffs"" in general, this documentary is a ""must see.""  I watched it over the course of several evenings on my Kindle while working out on my treadmill.

2069607,4,B00029HJPS,"Several reviewers seem confused about when this documentary was made. It's not helped by recent distributors who've stamped it ""1995,"" ""2004,"" and here, ""2007."" Shock is understandable, though I'm surprised anyone would be unable to figure out that this is mid-1960s fare. The bottom-scooped audio track, the dissonant proto-Philip Glass chamber orchestra -- yeah, it's about as old as the Beatles. Narrator Douglas Rain last worked regularly in the 1980s. Film consultant Elmo Luuk died in 1978 (did they hold a seance?).

Owing to age, perhaps, the subject is covered broadly, framed in the Second World War from prelude to V-E. If you're a buff, you probably already know it; if you're curious about unseen footage, it's probably been on a collector's YouTube channel for a while. To be fair, Douglas Rain's script is a little portentous for modern ears, and if you're old enough the presentation will remind you of reel-to-reel projectors in high school.

All the same, it's an effective primer for someone who's not familiar with Generalplan Ost, Lebensraum, Operation Barbarossa, or the rest of the horror in the East many people don't know about because the largest battles in the history of mankind were between the bad guys. I'll take quaintness over redundant, simplified and over-reenacted documentaries so common today. Tastes have changed, but the topic remains a sobering one.

The savagery of war and the intense suffering of the soldiers and civilians is laid bare for us to see, and while it is not pretty, it is effective. What stood out in stark relief was the lack of value of human life as seen by indiscriminate artillery and air bombing, hangings, executions, and close quarter combat. The losses suffered by Russia were staggering and yet, Stalin was prepared to sacrifice every single one of his people in defense of the country, so in addition to the waste of life in battle, the cruelty of both sides and merciless attacks on civilians took unimaginable numbers of them in ultra-violent death. I don't care how many documentaries it takes, this information is invaluable as if we do not study history as the saying goes, we are doomed to repeat it.

2069616,3,B00029HJPS,"Much of this video is the same footage available in all other such videos, and only the voice is different; it comes across as heavily biased towards the Nazi cleverness that allowed much of southern Europe to be gobbled up without firing a shot.",1389225600,,246,4.613636363636363
2069617,4,B00029HJPS,"Very graphic and honest--several repeats--Hitler and his command lacked the equipment and the clothing to defeat the Russians.
This information demonstrated the problem Hitler had.",1388707200,,180,6.24
2069618,4,B00029HJPS,Very Interesting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in World War2. Many serious scenes taken right from World War2 .Enjoy it!,1387929600,,133,5.090909090909091
2069619,5,B00029HJPS,"This documentary really highlights the Nazi arrogance that lead to their ultimate defeat. They were confident for very long and that confidence took them long into the heart of a giant country from which many would never escape.

The atonal soundtrack, the almost-satirical narration, and the amazing footage are well orchestrated.",1387843200,2,331,5.490196078431373
2069620,4,B00029HJPS,"This documentary is worth watching for those not familiar with eastern front of WWII.  It covers the sequence of events leading up to, and including, the German operation Barbarossa.  I have not seen Disc 2.  Without viewing Disc 2, a complete critique of ""The Russian German War"" cannot be made.",1382832000,,296,4.88
2069621,4,B00029HJPS,"Give you an idea of ground combat.  However, should have inclined some maps along with the narration.  Fits well with some of the books about the Eastern front combat.",1382572800,,167,4.724137931034483
2069622,4,B00029HJPS,"I enjoy WWII history but, like many Americans, have tended concentrate on events in the European and Pacific theaters where America fought on the ground. This documentary fills in story of the massive war that was also being fought on the Eastern front, and how Russia initially rolled up under Nazi aggression like so many other countries had. But of course that is not the end of the story, as Russia rallies and comes roaring back, eventually persecuting the war all the way to Berlin. Great original film footage and good narration.",1381795200,5,536,4.836956521739131
2069623,5,B00029HJPS,"The video compilation reflects the original footage presented as 5 stars. Fascinating and horrifying . . . the absolute disregard for humankind  exhibited by the Nazi's is well documented. The Eastern Front presented not only a solution for the Jewish Question but for the extermination of those considered as 'unter menschhen.' Instead of hiding the facts, the Nazi indoctrination revels their  true purpose. There is the realization of what happened to prisoners of war and civilians alike. Only original footage can portray all the terrifying consequences to areas conquered by the Nazi war machine. Stalin's manner of treating German prisoners of war and even Russians taken prisoner by German forces is well documented. This series allows one to follow all the war atrocities as well as the sentiments of Stalin and Hitler. How to explain  the aberrant behavior can be found in recent genocide. Provocative and compelling with accurate information. The narration is typical of the propaganda/documentary films of that era. Unique footage and a more in depth presentation of prevailing 'ideology' than the usual overview. Recommended for beginners as well as those who are students of WWII history.",1380931200,6,1202,5.349206349206349

2069626,3,B00029HJPS,"Five stars for the original footage, which is spectacular. The narrator, who voiced Hal the Computer in 2001 , A Space Odyssey, sounds like a wartime newsreel commentator, which is fitting, I suppose, given the material. The script, however, is only informative if one has never heard of Operation Barbarossa or knows nothing about the Russian Front. Additionally the prose is really purple, since the writer seems to think it enhances the dramatic content to repeat words. Eg: It was a drive that was relentless. Relentless. RELENTLESS. But the worst part of it was the dissonant score- imagine Nora the piano playing cat, only without the cute fluffiness. At the end of both volumes the endless pinging of the piano keys was relentless, Relentless, RELENTLESS.  Recommended with the sound off.",1378684800,8,795,5.115384615384615

2069630,3,B00029HJPS,The footage is incredible and I eventually got used to the odd music and narration. For WWII enthusiasts it is a worthwhile endeavor just to hear the Katyusha rockets. I now understand why they have always been described as terrifying!,1369785600,,235,4.9

2069632,4,B00029HJPS,"I am a depression baby and having lived through WW2 I found this documentary to really expose the complete hatred between the Germans and Russians that Hitler and Stalin were able use to their advantage. It also brings out the fact that part of Russia's
strength is the vastness of their landscape and ability to produce huge amounts of armaments, once this sleeping giant was awakened.",1363824000,,386,4.863636363636363

2069634,5,B00029HJPS,"I've seen a lot of documentaries about WWII. This film isn't full of fancy graphics, re-enactments, or other high-tech stuff. It's old footage and it's brutal. The script is well-written and points out the moral lapses on all sides. Americans tend to forget the toll that WWII took on the Russians. Their losses dwarfed ours by many magnitudes, and that includes civilian deaths. This is a worthwhile documentary to watch if you want a fairly thorough overview of Russian involvement in WWII. It doesn't pull punches, totally lacks sentimentalism, is very factual, and - like the subject it covers - is brutal and hard to watch. Want to be reminded of how lucky you are right now and of how horrific war is? Watch this.",1353801600,25,719,4.76
