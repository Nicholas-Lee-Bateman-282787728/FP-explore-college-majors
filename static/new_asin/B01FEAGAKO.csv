8760691,1,B01FEAGAKO,"I really looked forward to this video, but the sound quality for the first of the two episodes was completely unintelligible, video quality was poor. The second episode was not much better. The time period commercials at the end were much better, but that is not what I bought the video to see. I did not expect total clarity given the materials age. This video was a great disappointment. I cannot recommend the purchase of this product.",1500249600,2,438,4.701298701298701
