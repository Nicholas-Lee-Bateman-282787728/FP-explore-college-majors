8329416,1,B001O4C6T4,This film had some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a film. Basically the story is a ripoff of Hitchcocks Liftboat with a few minor changes played by unknown actors. Poorly written story simply does not come across as believable. Pass on this one if given a choice.,1431216000,,275,4.411764705882353
8329417,3,B001O4C6T4,"Although the acting was fine, there was really no standout performances in this tale of eight people adrift in a life raft after a Japanese prisoner caused their plane to crash in the ocean in the days after WWII.  Richard Denning and Ann Doran head the life boat cast and Russell Hayden (Hopalong Cassidy's sidekick) heads the army air force rescue crew searching for them.",1402531200,,374,4.753846153846154
8329418,2,B001O4C6T4,"Save your time, effort and money on this one. I love old black and white movies, but sadly, this is not one of them. It is a very boring and slow moving film.
Can't recommend this one at all.",1393545600,,191,3.923076923076923
8329419,4,B001O4C6T4,"This story as it says in the opening credits is about the AAF -- the Army Air Force -- and what they did after VJ Day (Victory in Japan Day) for 8 people; 1 person in the story is lost.  I cannot agree with the other reviewer from June that the sound was good, I found it spotty and recommend that the sound be turned up quite high.  Since there are no commercials that really doesn't matter but I recommend being prepared for it.  The picture itslef was also often unfocused but that could be the limited budget and not the transcription to modern media so I cannot comment there.

While there are many parallels between Hitchcock' s Lifeboat, which I adore, and Seven:  namely they both have enemy prisoners with them (Lifeboat a Nazi sailor; Seven a Japanese officer)  this movie does have a very unique spin on the lifeboat tale; sun-blindness, very poor provisions and an amnesia victim to name a few but the most important difference is the importance of the AAF in finding the lost crew.  It's a nice tale, which is well done with a very uplifting ending.  Enjoyable matinee fare.",1314403200,2,1087,4.510204081632653
8329420,5,B001O4C6T4,"I expected this to be a low budget rip-off of Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat,"" but I was surprised to find it was anything but that. In fact, this film goes to show what can be done on a low budget with great actors and a top-notch production crew.

The story is about U.S. air rescue teams who help people who are stranded on ocean waters. Following World War II, a captured Japanese colonel is being taken from Japan to the Philippines to stand trial as a war criminal. In flight, the prisoner overcomes his guards and takes over the plane, eventually causing it to crash off course in the ocean.

Most of the people on board survive the crash landing. They manage to inflate a large rubber raft and get aboard. The rest of the film deals with their efforts to survive on the open ocean. The film shows in a realistic manner how they get weaker as each day passes. Lack of food and water, exposure to the elements, and shark infested waters take their toll on the small group in the raft.

In the meantime, military sea rescue teams are flying around the clock along the plane's last known route in a desperate attempt to find any survivors before it's too late.

Russell Hayden, Richard Denning, and Ann Doren are just a few members of this remarkable cast. Also, Alpha's print of this film is in good shape along with the sound. ""Seven Were Saved"" is a lost gem well worth discovering.",1308441600,,1380,4.464285714285714
