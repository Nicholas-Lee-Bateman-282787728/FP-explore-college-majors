8525448,3,B0085AXSCO,"Bruckner is, or can be, a tedious composer who repeats passages for no reason known to those who listen. His symphonies are long and are soemtimes slowly presented to the point of tension.  Celibidache is interesting to observe as he milks measures for content that, after having been repeated in rehearsals over and over again, seem to have little, if any, audio effect to anyone else.  He is a master of knowing the music.  Bruckner is one composer who brass players should adore.  Frankly, the brass effects are the most compelling and most interesting and without them there would be no need to sit through the works.",1356134400,2,621,4.775700934579439
8525449,5,B0085AXSCO,"Celibidache is one of the best directors in playing Anton Bruckner. His reading of the Fourth Symphony is accurate, meditative, majestic. Other directors can interpret either Bruckner, but in a hurry. With Celibidache, Bruckner is as it should be: unhurried, infinite. With this Fourth Symphony there are few who are close to the height of the director, as Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic in his recording for EMI in 1971, or Karl Bohm with Vienna Philharmonic recording for Decca in 1973.",1347408000,10,493,5.098765432098766
