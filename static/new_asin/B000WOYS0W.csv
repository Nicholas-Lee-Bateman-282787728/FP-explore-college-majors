8224693,3,B000WOYS0W,"Prayer Life is a film with a great message on the importance of prayer and relying on God. It has a decent soundtrack and there is some thought that went into the story and the crime being investigated/prosecuted. I also love that a Christian film has such a multi-racial cast as these tend to be more segregated with either almost all Black or all White casts in Christian films.

The negatives of prayer life is the acting which is rarely passable. Diana Villamonte as the accused gives a wooden performance in all but one scene (in a church) so it's hard to feel her as ""in turmoil."" The villains are just very transparently the villains and our evil CEO discusses in a public hallway outside of the courtroom how he's dissatisfied with the service he's getting from the Federal Proseuctor he's bribing. Darrel Cox is decent as the hacker Kirby and has a great scene, but that's about it.

Still, I find the message of the film compelling and while it can be preachy at times, it avoids the faults of the worst Christian films and is an edifying if not necessarily entertaining film.",1421452800,,1086,4.592783505154639
8224694,5,B000WOYS0W,"I did not expect this movie to be of such great quality and the message...well, I was very moved.  A must-see for anyone with decisions to make or just thinking they have too much to do to be thinking about God right now.",1222732800,,221,4.1395348837209305
8224695,5,B000WOYS0W,This was a very refreshing movie. I liked the way that it showed the importance of prayer in our daily life and how it can give us wisdom.,1211846400,,138,3.9642857142857144
8224696,5,B000WOYS0W,"This movie has a very inspiring message of conduct and beliefs.  I found it very good.  I liked the performance of all the actors, especially Diana Villamonte as Mary Dupree.  I think we will see her more often in movies.  She is a pretty good actress.
I am going to buy this movie again, this time to give as a gift to special friends.",1204934400,2,336,4.203125
8224697,5,B000WOYS0W,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  We need more wholesome entertainment of this kind.  It was very refreshing to see a good family movie that has substance, and a lot of meaning especially in these trying times we live in today.  This movie was very real, and exhibits how we should have faith in what we say we believe.  It reminded me to stand strong, in what I truly believe.  It's a very dynamic, and inspirational work of art.  It helped me to remember to always rely on prayer and its power. After all, God said that He would never forsake us or leave us alone.  We must remember that through God all things are possible, if we truly believe.  I recommend this movie to everyone.",1202515200,2,683,4.365079365079365

This is an excellent movie, it help one to realize the power of Prayer.
I really like the movie and would like for all believers and non believers too see the movie, to know how powerful prayer is.",1202428800,2,219,4.238095238095238
8224699,4,B000WOYS0W,"This film is an excellent show in one's faith in times of strife.  In our walks its easy to have faith in good times, but will you have it in bad?  This film is about three people who's faith and walks with God are at different points.  Brenda's faith is strong and unshakeable.  Philip, Brenda's husband  has little to no faith, while Mary, Brenda's good friend, is experiencing a bad situation and her faith is wavering.

I really liked this film, and want to show it in my church and Sunday school class.",1200096000,2,507,4.397849462365591
