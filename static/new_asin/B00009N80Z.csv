1885578,2,B00009N80Z,"We bought this DVD under the premise that it included episodes 5, 6, 7 and 12.  Key word being included, not only. Never assume is a lesson well learned.  We were then highly disappointed by the fact that these were the only episodes on it.  In my opinion these aren't even the better episodes.  Unless you just want these four you had better just settle on buying the season releases or taping the slew of them they play on Fox the week of Halloween.",1063324800,6,451,4.333333333333333
1885579,1,B00009N80Z,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE The Simpsons,and greatly enjoy the Halloween episodes,and I can't wait until it arrives in my mailbox. Finally, I'll get to see ""Homer"" with a clear picture (as opposed to the grainy one I taped off TV so many eons ago) My one star is for FOX.They initially said Season 5 of the Simpsons would be out by now. Perhaps this Treehouse of Horror DVD was a way of trying to make up for it a little (or bilk us out of more money, take your pick), but FOX ISN'T EVEN PROMOTING IT! No store in my area has it, and people look think I'm making it up when I ask for it. I tried 2 national chains,and nobody knows what I'm talking about! How can people buy your product if nobody knows it's out there?
  If you've found tis page, then you obviously know it's out there. If you're wondering about buying it...well..you must be a Simpsons fan, or you wouldn't be staring at these reviews,right? If you enjoy their yearly Halloween escapades, then go for it! Some of the best are to be found here. I wouldn't reccomend it for those who are easily grossed out. Though it's exaggerated cartoon violence, some people can't seem to grasp the fact that they're only drawings! No actors were harmed in the making of these episodes. (well..then again..we ARE talking about FOX here). So grab a bag full o' Halloween candy (mmmm...free candy),stuff yourself silly, have a scare, and laugh your hairy yellow ... off! (You'll probably have to order it from right here at Amazon, as nobody else seems to be aware that it even exist)",1062806400,9,1534,4.455516014234876
1885580,4,B00009N80Z,"The ""Treehouse of Horror"" Halloween episodes of the Simpsons have consistently been some of the funniest of the series.  It's great to finally see some of them collected on one DVD.  For the Simpsons completists who already own the first three seasons on DVD and plan on buying the rest, you don't have to worry about getting redundant material because this DVD collects the later ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes that probably won't be in season anthologies until years from now.  So, if you were holding out for that reason, I recommend you stop holding out and get this DVD now.",1062806400,3,579,4.77
1885581,1,B00009N80Z,"First of all, they could have fit more episodes on this disk.  Second, why the random choice of episodes?  Why not put ALL the Halloween episodes on, or at least keep it sequential?
These guys seem almost purposely spiteful in the way they ham-hand their DVD releases... can they get it right once?  Is that so much to ask?
Apparently.",1062806400,5,335,4.55
1885582,1,B00009N80Z,"Let me start off by saying that I am just about as big a Simpsons fan as they come, but this does not make sense. Fox is wasting their time making cheezy dvd's like this instead of giving us the good stuff, the full seasons. (And I use good stuff lightly. The third season, which took a year to come out, is pretty light on special features and the menus are very simplistic. Seems to me they could have thrown that together in a couple of months.)
Just to clarify, I don't have a problem with the full season dvd's being sparse. I have all of the episodes on tape, but, as time goes on, the picture quality becomes less than desireable. I just want a perfect, uncut copy of the episodes to watch whenever I want. Hell, I don't care if they give us four dvd's with only the episodes on them, just don't take a year every time you do it. They should be cranking out at least three a year. Dvd will be extinct before all of the seasons see the light of day.
Back to the task at hand, I'll admit that I am a sucker who bought this dvd. Let's face it, Treehouse V probably won't be out until 2006 sometime and I can't stand the way that the station around here has been hacking the episodes in syndication. Plus I figured the ""featurette"" with Kang and Kodos would be worth a laugh. Unfortunately, the ""featurette"" was just a summary of clips from the Treehouse episodes. So, basically, the dvd has nothing new for Simpson fans. As the seasons are released, you will have the exact same thing.
I don't know how many people have read this far, but I think we need to hit Fox in their wallets before they start listening to us. We should all boycott the upcoming ""Christmas with the Simpsons"" Dvd. As long as we keep forking out $10 each time they release a dvd with nothing more than what we will pay $40 for later, they will keep ripping us off.",1062720000,9,1841,4.232954545454546

On to the review.
Condition of the first item was very except no actually DVD.
Shipping was fast but since I had to reorder, I give it 2.5 stars.
The actual episodes are funny. Obviously the older ones are better but still.
Price is very fair. I don't mind spending five dollars on Simpsons merch. Especially actual shows. Especially especially Treehouse of Horrors themed merch.",1383782400,,671,4.376
1885623,2,B00009N80Z,"This had some funny bits from when the SIMPSONS was more enjoyable to me (and I always liked the Halloween specials)....but four measly episodes? Why couldn't we get every ""Treehouse Of Horror"" up to that moment? It would be good to see the very first few, which I don't recall, but this starts with #5. After #7, it skips to #12 and that's it.

The lone special feature on here is advertised on the cover, stating a featurette with the Kang and Kodos aliens -- yet it's not special at all and consists of an approximately 3 minute montage of a few of their appearances. I expected some new animation with them thanking the viewer for watching and then something weird happening.

It's not a great release or compilation, but there are dozens of cheap/used copies here if someone wants to check it out.

Oh...and in the editorial review you see when you check out this product, it mentions how in #5 (""The Shinning"" portion), there is an exchange: ""You mean 'The Shining,'"" Bart corrects. ""Shh, you want to get sued?"" Homer reprimands him).

My only regret is that there are only a few of these classic Halloween episodes on this collection, rather than it being a full dvd set with ALL the Halloween Simpsons that they've done over in the years-- if Fox had any brains (which we already know they don't, since they're also the ones who hated & canceled ""Futurama"" and the smash cult-hit ""Firefly""!), they would release such a product, since they'd make a fortune off of all the hardcore Simpsons fans who would also love to own such a complete collection!

After watching Christmas movies to no end I thought it would be appropriate to clean the pallot with this DVD.

The plot lines have been covered by the top reviewers so I won't bother.  At the moment I would say I liked The Shining, Homer 3d, and the Wiz kids best.

Overall the DVD is good.  However, one slightly annoying feature is the two step selection process.  You choose the version and then have to slide over to the play.  Also, there is no play all option.",1167609600,,690,4.166666666666667

Why Matt Groening and co. wanted to release this, I have no idea. As far as I know, Simpsons seasons are selling great, so I wouldn't imagine this is a desperate attempt for money. But if you ask me, if they wanted to make a lot more money, they would have made some big expensive collection of EVERY Halloween episode made up to the point this was released. I think that would be awesome!!! Also, this is nearly osbolete, since every season except for one have been released that contain these episodes. And once the 9th season is released, this won't be worth anything.

So, once again, this is good if you're a completist or you don't plan to buy any of the seasons. Otherwise, stay away and buy all the seasons instead.",1157414400,4,895,4.559006211180124
1885654,5,B00009N80Z,"For nearly the past two decades, the best Halloween episode of any show on television to watch has been ""The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror"".  ""The Simpsons"" are chock-full of allusions of every kind.  They've parodied everything from the Bible to famous Greek myths to famous novels.  In the ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes the show parodies famous works of horror, from classical films to Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem ""The Raven"" to episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  This DVD brings together four episodes of ""Treehouse of Horror.""

""Treehouse of Horror V"" has the family portraying there own versions of Stephen King's THE SHINING and Ray Bradbury's A SOUND OF THUNDER in `The Shinning"" and ""Time and Punishment"" respectively, while the school becomes tainted with allusions to SWEENEY TODD and SOYLENT GREEN in ""Nightmare Cafeteria.""

In ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" the Simpson children come face to face with a Freddy Krueger-inspired version of Groundskeeper Willie in ""Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace"" while Homer goes 3-D in ""Homer 3"".  Also, the entire city of Springfield has to confront giant advertising displays that come to life in ""Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores.""

Kang and Kodos kidnap to be Presidential candidates Bob Dole and Bill Clinton so they can take over the world in the ""Mr. Kang Goes to Washington"" episode from ""Treehouse of Horror VII"" while Bart finds out about his long-hidden twin in ""The Thing and I"" and Lisa creates a miniature world in a dish in ""The Genesis Tub"".

The last episode on the DVD, ""Treehouse of Horror XII"" finds Homer being cursed by a Gypsy in ""Hex and the City"",  allusions to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY in ""House of Wacks"", and a spoof on Harry Potter by Lisa and Bart in ""Wiz Kids.""

The only extra on this DVD is a montage of clips with Kang and Kodos.

Overall, this is a great collection. I enjoyed watching these episodes and they have some educational value (I used the ""Time and Punishment"" when we read Ray Bradbury's story A SOUND OF THUNDER).  I just wish they would release all of the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episodes in one set.  That would be a true treat.",1157068800,4,2116,4.793388429752066

1885660,5,B00009N80Z,"Although it's far from complete, ""Treehouse of Horror"" has some of the funniest film and TV parodies available. ""The Simpsons"" has become the standard against which all TV comedy should be judged; consistently year after year the show has been stellar. Even so-so seasons reach way beyond the standard sitcom. Even incomplete this is the funniest DVD of Simpson Halloween specials assembled.

Picture quality is good but not great while the sound quality is very good. The bonus feature consists of Kang and Kodos clips. It's not a bad bonus feature just a bit disappointing. While this doesn't compare to having every single episode from every single season on DVD, this isn't a bad place to enjoy some really clever episodes of the series.

We start, bizarrely enough, with ""Treehouse of Horror V"" which parodies ""The Shining"". Homer goes mad and tries to kill his family because he doesn't have any TV or beer. Then ""Time & Punishment"" takes a classic Ray Bradbury sci-fi story about time travel and twists it inside out. ""Nightmare Cafeteria"" shows that Principal Skinner has new uses for his students...as lunch.

""Treehouse of Horror VI"" opens with ""Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores"" a loving hommage to z-movies of the 50's. ""Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace"" takes clever aim at the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies with groundskeeper Willie as the Freddie Kruger of the tale. In ""Homer 3"" the writers cleverly take aim at ""Poltergeist"" and remove Homer from his two dimensional world into our own with very funny results.

With VII we get a take off on ""The Other"" and the whole evil twin thing. Lisa creates a world in miniature where she's God and Bart is the devil in a clever take off on a Theodore Sturgeon short story. Finally aliens Kang and Kodos replace Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in the clever political satire ""Mr. Kang Goes to Washington"".

VIII closes the set with a clever trio of stories ""Hex and the City"" (which takes the basic idea of ""Thinner"" and turns it inside out. ""House of Whacks"" finds a computer taking over the Simpson home for the love of Marge. Finally ""Wiz Kids"" takes on Harry Potter (among many others)in a very funny grand finale for this set. Why isn't 1, 2 & 3 included in this set you may ask? Who knows but if you want one clever Halloween DVD to watch with the older kids, this is it.",1097280000,7,2327,4.679706601466993
1885661,5,B00009N80Z,"THOH V is simply the best of the Simpsons Halloween genre, with The Shinning, Nightmare Cafeteria, and Time and Punishment.  VI and VII are also classics, and the episode in which Kang & Kodos take over the bodies of Bill Clinton & Bob Dole is -- eight years later -- one of the best political satires you can see during this election season.  (""We must go forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"")

Treehouse of Horror does not follow the storyline of the show - they are little one act parodies of horror movies that come around Halloween each year. Parents with small children should be smart enough not to show their kids something with ""Horror"" in the title. It is not fair to judge an entire series on a DVD of selected alternate-universe storylines. The humor on the Simpsons in the good years was far from crude - see Mr. Plow or Marge vs. the Monorail.
As for this DVD set, it's just a random sampling thrown together to make money for the holidays. Save your money and buy a boxed set.",1074556800,8,757,4.300699300699301

1885665,3,B00009N80Z,"I don't reget buying this DVD.  If you love the Simpsons, this is a good choice.

I agree with the common gripes.  Why didn't they release more of the good stuff?  A collection of Treehouse of Horror episodes would sell big.  I found the lack of good extras disappointing, too.  The DVD seemed just thrown together.

On the plus side, these probably are the best epidodes of Treehouse of Horror, for a pretty low price.  Number V is probably my favorite, and clinched my decision to by the disc.

I probably would have given this a two, but I think that the low price brings up the rating.  The store price is about half the price of the average new DVD.  They aren't trying to pass this off as some ""special edition"" DVD.  This is just some of the best episodes of the Simpsons you are going to find on one disc.",1069286400,2,813,4.276315789473684
1885666,4,B00009N80Z,"When it comes to Halloween episodes the big three are ""Roseanne,"" ""The Simpsons"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (although ""BtVS"" was always an every other year deal).  You would think that the producers of these shows would have figured out that offering an alternative to splatter flicks as what to watch on October 31st that video/DVD packages of classic Halloween episodes would be an obvious choice.  But you have to pick up seasons 2 and 4 (and wait for 6) of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" catch ""Roseanne"" in syndication, and deal with this limited offering from ""The Simpsons.""  It is not often that you come across a DVD that could have increased its average rating by a star if it just had ""Volume 1"" as part of the title.
Actually, this really should be ""Volume 2"" of ""The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror,"" because it offers ""Treehouse of Horror"" V, VI, VII and XII.  Whatever the joke is here, I am clearly missing out on it.  Why not V, VI, VII and VIII?  For that matter why not I, II, III and IV?  Is it because the first three seasons of the Simpsons are out on DVD?  It is because Roman numerals confused the people making the decisions?  To add insult to injury, these are bare boned discs.  No commentaries, no features, no animated menus, just a some clips of Kang and Kodos (e.g., Kang on Jerry Springer).  The episodes are great, but the bad faith effort here loses a star.
""Treehouse of Horror V"" offers a take off on ""The Shining,"" Homer traveling through time with the aid of a toaster in ""Time and Punishment,"" and the school staff doing the Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett bit with the students in ""Nightmare Cafeteria.""  ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" offers killer billboards in ""Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores,"" Groundskeeper Willie as a Freddie Krueger clone in ""Nightmare on Evergreen Terrance,"" and a computer generated Homer making it to the real world in ""Homer3"".  ""Treehouse of Horror VII"" reveals that Bart's evil twin has been chained in the attic in ""The Thing and I,"" Lisa creates a microscopic world as a science project in ""The Genesis Tub,"" and Kang and Kodos replace Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in the election as ""Mr. Kang Goes to Washington.""  We then skip ahead to ""Treehouse of Horror XII"" which has a gypsy curse destroying Homer's life in ""Hex and the City,"" the Simpsons living in a computerized home in ""House of Whacks,"" and the Simpsons' twist on Harry Potter in ""Wiz Kids.""
Of course, the rule of thumb here is what it always has been for ""The Simpsons,"" which is that the more familiar you are with the original films and other pop culture elements being referenced in these episodes, the more you will enjoy them.  I should add that these episodes have been ""restored"" for DVD, which means that the scenes cut for syndication are back in this time around.  But the obvious lesson here is that each fall, when the World Series finally ends and FOX gets around to airing the Simpson's new ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode sometime in early November you should go ahead an tape it to keep for your Halloween enjoyment each year.  Who knows when it will actually become available on DVD.",1069027200,32,3122,4.6268115942028984

1885668,5,B00009N80Z,"Since first airing, the Halloween Specials (aka Treehouse of Horror) have been some of the most imaginative and satirical of Simpsons episodes. It's a shame that this is not a double disc collection of ALL Halloween Specials to date but the 4 presented here are definitely some of the best.
First up is Treehouse of Horror 1 (1991) and, like Bart says about Friday the 13th part 1, it's pretty tame by today's standards. Second is Treehouse of Horror V (1995) which is my fave because it contains Homer 3, the episode in which Homer falls into the 3rd dimension and finally into the real world. Third is Treehouse of Horror VI (1996) in which the earth is enslaved by Kang and Kodos (posing as presidential candidates Clin-ton and Bob Dole). Lastly is Treehouse of Horror XI containing a fabulous Harry Potter spoof and the voice of Pierce Brosnan as a house who takes a shine to Marge.
The DVD is in 1.33:1, as drawn and is in Dolby 2.0 surround. The only extra is a short clip highlighting Kang and Kodos best moments. It would be cool of Fox to release a few more of these Halloween sets as only a third of the Halloween Specials are featured here, sadly the one where Freddy and Jason are sitting on their sofa at the beginning is not one of them. Still, it's definitely worth picking up.",1067040000,16,1292,4.478813559322034

One things I'd like to point out,- as a network, Fox must edit to fit in commercials, and the DVD extra, which only an observant one will notice, is that each episode is unedited.

-Picture and sound are fine.  Just like Cable.
-The price.  If it cost any more I would have passed.
-The episodes they have are good ones.

DIS-LIKED;
-Why Tree House Episodes V, VI, VII and XII?  Why not I, II, III and IV?
-Why not all of the Tree House Episodes on one, more expensive, DVD.  I could not resist that!
-The Kang and Kodos ""Bonus"" is merely a montage of clips.  No big deal.
