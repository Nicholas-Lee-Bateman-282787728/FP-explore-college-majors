5958220,5,B00EZ80L98,"Cagney has great suttle acting ability that, since he is wheelchair bound, this film shows how expressive he can be with his eyes.  Art Carney, always a favorite, does everything from the comedic to the dramatic in this as a washed out boxer that Cagney hires as a valet.  Heartwarming, as only two older masters can do.  Ellen Barkin is also up to sharing the screen with these two masters.  While not Gone With The WInd, and with the Cagney ""vocal help"" that Rich Little provided, this will become a film that will fit well in anyone's collection.",1396396800,3,549,4.571428571428571
5958221,5,B00EZ80L98,"This was the Final Film of one of the greatest actors of all time in James Cagney. He was best known for his gangster roles in White Heat, The Roaring Twenties, The Public Enemy and Angels With Dirty Faces. He got his one and only Oscar for his tour de force performance in Yankee Doodle Dandy. Cagney was a versatile actor and appeared in some other lesser known great films like The Strawberry Blonde, Lady Killer, G-Men, City For Conquest. The Smart Money saw him team up with the other gangster icon in Edward G. Robinson. I would have preferred to see those two go one on one. Each Dawn I Die saw him team up with his good friend George Raft which Cagney let Raft carry the film and is one of Raft's best pictures. Cagney as a Cowboy in The Oklahoma Kid with Bogart that was a fun film.
  Terrible Joe Moran is about an old retired boxer who has a granddaughter he has a distanced relationship with. Ellen Barkin plays the granddaughter and she really shines her as a troubled young woman with a boyfriend who is in deep trouble with the mob. She needs Jimmy's help or should I say Joe. Well the two don't get along very well from the past but you will watch the movie and see what happens. Art Carney did a fine job as Cagney's ex trainer and best friend. I liked this movie a lot. It wasn't a blockbuster like White Heat but it was a good movie about family with a good message we can all relate to. We have all been young and made mistakes. We all have families are rarely do families always get along. It's a touching movie and just a pleasure to see Jimmy on screen one more time. Rest in Peace Jimmy! Thanks for all the great movies and everything! Enjoy!",1391731200,7,1666,4.252365930599369
5958222,5,B00EZ80L98,"This is James Cagney's last film and the only drwaback is him being dubbed by Rich Little!! Despite this the film has a gREAT cast including  an Emmy for Art Carney who is fabulous as always!! Its a touching ,lovely story and they should have left Jimmy's Voice which was at the time still fine!!! If U love Cagney you will enjoy!!!",1385769600,3,332,4.354838709677419
5958223,5,B00EZ80L98,"a pleasure to watch this small film starring two big stars! albeit at times overly sentimental and with a horrible musical soundtrack with romantic sounds every time Barkin enters Cagney's place, near Central park (does she actually have the ""hots"" for grampa?) we are treated to a great script, direction, superb acting all around, esp. by Mr. Cagney and I *do not believe ALL of his speaking parts were dubbed*!

of course all Honeymooners fans love the episode where Art does his ""Cagney"" impression > what a great idea to unite them!",1429488000,3,537,4.836956521739131

5958225,5,B00EZ80L98,"Cagney doing Cagney in his final film..  Looked and sounded like James Cagney and even though Frank Gorshin dubbed his voice, it was the voice I expected James Cagney to have at that age..  Great movie even though the DVD wasn't as clear as I hoped.  I guess I'm getting spoiled by the digital age but if you get this, you won't be disappointed...",1422230400,2,347,4.390625

5958227,5,B00EZ80L98,"So wonderful to see the great James Cagney one more time.  He was a remarkably versatile actor . . . from Warners' greatest gangster in the 30s, to George M. Cohan in his Oscar-winning role in Yankee Doodle Dandy in the 40s to straight drama like Love Me or Leave Me in the 50s, he was an extraordinarily gifted actor.  Could anyone else have played Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces?  I don't think so.  It's regrettable that they dubbed Rich Little for the indomitable Cagney voice.",1411257600,,488,4.449438202247191
5958228,5,B00EZ80L98,"at last, this 1984 Emmy winning movie was released in 2013.this movie was not released in the united states because James Cagney was 84 years old and in a wheelchair..there were copies available in Spanish, and there were bootleg copies in poor quality. the movie is excellent and all of the actors were superb, especially  Art Carney and James Cagney. It is a pity but this movie was never released until now, but now that is available, don't miss it.",1409443200,2,452,4.65

James Cagneys' last movie on planet earth was especially poignant since there were
playbacks of the Joe Moran ex-prizefighter character actually depicted by a much younger
Cagney. Brought back memories of what a great actor he truly was.
Thanks for  a great watching experience and for the excellent delivery service.",1503014400,,407,5.074626865671642
