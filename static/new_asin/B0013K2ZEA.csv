3113320,5,B0013K2ZEA,"I'm a big fan of Gogol Bordello, and I think Eugene Hutz is an attractive, bold man. So, while browsing online I found Hutzovina and HAD to buy it. My intention was to purchase the online version instead of a DVD so I could download it on to my i-pod but this isn't downloadable for i-pods! So if that's your intention, don't do it! But, if you just hate the fuss of DVDs or you just don't want to wait to watch it, buy the online version and watch it instantly. Hutz is an interesting man who travels to Gypsy camps to have a better understanding of his gypsy roots. From watching this film, I've observed that he's a humble guy. He takes rejection well, he's so enthusiastic and delighted when he meets his musical ""hero"", and he struggles with a one way love from a girl who made this video (and his trip) possible. Although is seems as if Eugene is using this girl for her money for his trip across the world (which I'm pretty sure he is...) you'll see a nice side of Eugene when it comes to his people and his beautiful culture. Just because you like Gypsy music, doesn't mean you like Gypsy people...and that's what he explores. You'll see all for yourself. And enjoy!",1310083200,,1174,4.340909090909091
3113321,2,B0013K2ZEA,This is a good doc if you're a die hard Gogol Bordello fan but in the end the filmmaker has personal issues while filming and it detracts it from being a great film.,1290816000,3,165,4.03030303030303
3113322,5,B0013K2ZEA,I absolutely LOVE this DVD - its a really fun glimpse into Gypsy life...anyone who loves Gogol Bordello will love this!,1259539200,2,119,4.714285714285714
3113323,2,B0013K2ZEA,"This was an interesting take on the documentary of a rock star. the film is the filmmaker's fangirl crush expounded into an hour long feature that attempts to trace the lead singer of Gogol Bordello's roots and musical influences. The film suffers and simultaneously benefits from the dichotomy of being the movie that allows Eugene Hutz's fans a more intimate look at his beginnings and being a venue for the filmmaker to get back into Hutz's life. In offering a more personal view and explaining her stake in the story, Pavla Fleischer manages to show how charismatic Hutz is but she is ultimately unable to provide any deeper insight into her main subject because she is too busy moping around about not becoming his love interest.",1241740800,8,734,4.833333333333333
3113324,5,B0013K2ZEA,"This review is long overdue. The seller was timely and accurate. I would totally buy from them again. The film was great. If you love hutz, gypsies or gogol bordello i highly reccomend it!",1235606400,5,188,4.5588235294117645
3113325,5,B0013K2ZEA,"Party!!! Great for Gogol Bordello fans & Hutz-lover's! However, it is a little short. Buy it, BUT ONLY after you buy all the Gogol Bordello albums & have played them so much you wake up singing them. This DVD is more like a ""day in the life of"" & is best enjoyed as an extra or bonus material to watch while waiting for the next Gogol Bordello CD to come out.

ps - a DVD of a concert would be the ultimate!!! If you've never seen GB, go go go & join the PARTY!!!",1235260800,2,463,3.925531914893617
3113326,4,B0013K2ZEA,"When my fiancee and I first rented this film, we weren't expecting such a personal account and observation of the life of Eugene H&uuml;tz. But it is one, as told, apparently, by someone who is just as infatuated with him as most of us fans are.

Either because he is drunk most of the time, or simply because he does not care, he is perfectly open throughout most of the film, as if a camera doesn't exist around him at all, and he is merely carrying on with business as usual. His affinity for Roma people is observable in this film as well, and you can see that it is genuine. Throughout the documentary, he travels around Eastern Europe and listens to some of the most unique versions of many Roma songs, and joins in as one of their own.

Then we also see his personal life, where he grew up, some distant family he has that remain in Ukraine, and so on. Altogether, it is not uninteresting. My fiancee and I were so pleased with the movie that I bought it for her for Christmas last year, and we'll watch it when both of us are in the mood for some H&uuml;tzian commentary on life, as well as the accompanied vodka to enhance the enjoyability of it.

Total recommendation: very high, for someone appreciates the music of Gogol Bordello and other related acts. If you were merely interested in Eugene H&uuml;tz as an actor, then this film may not be for you. But everyone who else who loves him for his wit, charm, and alcoholic genius, it will be a favourite on everyone's list",1231804800,9,1483,4.385454545454546
3113327,3,B0013K2ZEA,"This documentary is not awful, Pavla Fleischer is fortunate to have met so charismatic a subject to make a film about. However, her sparse narrative, and lack of editorial structure to the film don't do much to tell a story or show a spiritual journey. Though Hutz talks repeatedly about spiritual journeys, this film to me, seemed more like a little more than a personal memento. That is not to say it is not entertaining. It is. And though i do not think it makes a great movie, it was not irritating, just a bit hollow. Recommended for the music and Hutz, and possibly a little for Fleischer as well. Though late-comers to it may expect more from it that it can deliver.",1222473600,7,673,4.479674796747967
3113328,4,B0013K2ZEA,"We definitely enjoyed this video as it features Eugene Hutz, the lead person of Gogol Bordello, however it is a bit disjointed. The obvious attraction that the filmmaker, Pavla, had for her subject rather got in the way of a man searching for his roots.

Eugene is bigger than life and for Pavla to expect any different outcome was a bit naive, although I'm certainly glad she went ahead with the project. The DVD has quite a few extra features which is nice as many DVD's do not. If you're not familiar with Gogol Bordello, take a listen to one of their CDs or better yet, see them in concert, they are AMAZING.

And then you will appreciate this DVD.",1208995200,12,652,4.425

The Pied Piper Of Hutzovina tells the story of two people getting to the core of the emotions that prompted a cross country journey to  Hutz's homeland.

3113331,2,B0013K2ZEA,"This was not a documentary. Even Eugene is surprised by how little the producer knows about him. She purely made the movie to try to seduce him. She even admits this in the movie. She has zero idea how our when to edit.

3113335,3,B0013K2ZEA,"Watched this and have mixed feelings about it.

First, the good:
The main reason to watch this is for the music, interesting characters Eugene seeks out, and, of course, his charismatic personality. The music really is just fantastic. It's definitely engaging, and gives a glimpse into some small unknown pockets of the world- like the gypsy camps they visit. These are the only reasons to watch this, and they're good ones. But...

The bad:
I almost feel embarrassed for the director. So much of her narration is based on her crush on this guy and he's got no interest in her. She follows him around like a puppy dog- it's depressing. Since the documentary was her way of getting him back into her life, there's no real formula to it. She doesn't help paint a picture at all, and if anything, her narrative that repeatedly mentions her unrequited feelings for him takes away from it. Further, he clearly knows this and takes advantage of it, which shows that he's quite self serving and really not at all concerned with hurting her feelings. All in all, they used one another, and that fact makes parts of this documentary a bit uncomfortable. Everything about this speaks of a (albeit high quality) home video of someone who has a crush on someone, with some post-hoc narration to make it seem official.

tl;dr
If you enjoy interesting characters and Gypsy music, definitely watch it. However, be prepared to be made a little uncomfortable by the love-struck director and the guy (Eugene) who is using her feelings to get a trip around Eastern Europe.",1394841600,4,1553,4.765799256505576
3113336,3,B0013K2ZEA,I am a HUGE Gogol Bordello fan; I have seen them live and watched other documentaries on them but this documentary was crap. It is a really short film. Nothing really happens and you learn nothing about Eugene or the band. Basically a girl falls in love with Eugene and he doesn't feel the same way. They just tour some gypsy camps and sing songs. It is worth watching but not buying. Unfortunately I bought it. Maybe I am being too harsh but I was expecting more.,1360800000,2,464,4.344827586206897
3113337,5,B0013K2ZEA,"This little documentary exceeded my expectations.  When I originally read about it, I thought it might be a bit of a fan doc filmed by a simpering, infatuated female, and while it does have some elements of that, it goes significantly deeper than I first thought it would.

I purchased it (ok, why lie?) because I've got a little crush on the subject, but I'm pleased to say that the content is at times both gritty and touching and more interesting than expected.  Mr. Hutz reveals himself to be open to an extreme, in both good ways and bad.  The film explores deeply impoverished gypsy camps where Mr. Hutz joins in traditional music and dancing, and goes as far as Siberia, a fascinating and envy inducing journey.  Eugene Hutz clearly has a passion and a love for his Gypsy roots.  We also get a glimpse of Eugene's close family, including his clearly beloved grandmother and insight into tender side of Mr. Hutz which is otherwise probably difficult to unearth.

Although Pavla's infatuation did, at times, detract from the film, it was difficult not to feel a little sorry for her.

My  main complaint is that it isn't long enough to touch very deeply on the deep issues addressed, nor was it long enough to do justice to Mr. Hutz's huge character and personality.  It could have been forty-five minutes longer, with a little more depth and development and still would not have been not boring.

The extras on the film were interesting, and it was nice to have that added layer.

All in all, I would give it four and a half stars - a half star missing for the length.  Recommended.",1332633600,,1588,4.588652482269503

8251378,4,B0013K2ZEA,"I love gypsy music and being Ukrainian myself I was really interested in seeing how everything comes together. The intermixing of the beautiful and uplifting Roma music, more modern music, and Ukrainian folk. He's obviously an extremely enigmatic character, a great musician, humble, and produces great music. His inspiration for music is in everything from the train to the sewing machine. You can tell he hears the world, rather than sees it. It's great to see a film that's related to Ukraine in some way that isn't made in negative overtones and undertones. So that was refreshing. The most telling of himself was definitely when he was visiting his hometown in Kiev. I loved when he was just chilling on the stoop and talking with his friend about what they used to do. I felt for the Ukrainians and Roma who  kept asking for the film crew to take them with them whether it was to get work or just get out of their conditions. It made me feel grateful and appreciative of my family's immigration. Life is very, very hard in Ukraine. The fact that it's even harder than normal for the Roma is very saddening. You can definitely feel and see their collective sadness. Broke my heart a bit when they made their first stop, especially the girl who was crying and one of the Roma men was playing Eugene's guitar with the broken string and Eugene asked him to go get his and he said he couldn't afford one, that they were too expensive for them. He was such a talented guitarist, was sad to see that he wasn't able to have something as simple as a guitar to express himself and lift his spirits, as it so obviously did. I was almost rooting for Eugene to give him his guitar hah.

 I wish they had expanded more on the spiritualness he mentioned so frequently, but it seemed to get lost in the undertone of the directors physical and emotional affection for him, which seemed to create a bias within the film. It was almost more of a proclamation of her feelings towards him, which were not reciprocated in the same manner and it was obvious that she was not happy about him having a girl with him on part of it for more personal than professional reasons (like the 3 day ""long goodbye"" mentions. I think any director would be a bit irritated by that when you're on a budget, but she had already established her physical attraction to him and her envy of the girl, so it just seemed more about that to me.

At the end, she speaks about (during the london concert) ""all"" of the girls in the front row as if they're only there because they're attracted to him (more than a musician). Once again I think that's the bias that comes out from her own feelings that shes projecting onto other women throughout the film. I guess I just expect more of an attempt of a non-bias view from the lens of a documentary film maker.
I also didn't like that a lot wasn't translated. It wasn't like all wasn't, so it didn't make sense on why some parts that'd seem very telling weren't translated, and others were. Like the girl in the gypsy camp who was crying. She told her why and tried to say it in several ways so she'd understand, so it was obviously important to the girl to try and communicate it, and then she never translated it for the film.

This documentary is a really good view into a completely different side of life. Would watch again!",1472428800,,362,4.584615384615384

8251383,2,B0013K2ZEA,"Interesting to see the singer in a different light. He exudes a passion for gypsy music that is particularly captivating. Unfortunately, he ""seems"" to care about everyone except the girl he is using to take him around the world. Then again, we only hear the girl's version of events and will never know what really transpired between the two. It would seem she had a different idea of what this journey would be, and when that fell through, so did the movie's plot.

For me, this movie only scratches the surface of this man's persona/ethnocentrism and it left me wanting something far more journalistic, probing.",1464912000,,613,4.838095238095238

8251385,2,B0013K2ZEA,"What a waste of time! What a waste of a fascinating subject. The filmmaker is WAY too involved emotionally with Hutz and lets you know it in no uncertain terms. Not that you could avoid noticing if you were actually awake during the movie. It would have been great if someone who knew something about filmmaking and would stop whining had done this. Oh, well.",1448841600,,359,4.538461538461538
