8067117,5,B0009UZG8M,"One of the best dvds in the great ""Between the Lions"" series.  My two year old grandson would like to play it everytime he comes over and enjoys each of the many segments. He clearly follows and often mimics the various ways the show reinforces vowel sounds (""The Vowelles"" singing group), phonics and word identification.  The relationships among the lion characters is also a strong role model for family communication, affection and love of reading.",1175385600,8,452,5.013333333333334
