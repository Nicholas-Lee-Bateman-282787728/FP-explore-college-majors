5940066,4,B00ESGGAYM,"It would be five, but no closed-captioning. The audio quality is not the best - but what is after 20 years? I find it odd that the first season - released by CBS - did have it, but all these by VEI do not. Sad.",1469404800,,210,3.688888888888889
5940067,2,B00ESGGAYM,"The series is actually really good but the problem is the quality of the discs. Disc 2 in particular just freezes and restarts at the beginning. I contracted VEI who said they would send out a replacement disc. I did received a replacement disc (no 2) on the 6th June 2016 (after waiting since March) from VEI. It still played a little ""sticky"" in places but at least I could watch the 3rd and 4th episode on the disc. If you have issues I suggest doing

Great series - but wait for it to be released at a later time in hopes of the quality being better.",1463097600,,554,4.177570093457944

5940070,1,B00ESGGAYM,"The show deserves four or five stars. The seller said it was a full six discs which would cover all of season six.

I only have received three disks which cover only the first half of season six. I now have to buy the second half separately.

This is false advertising.",1459123200,,269,4.254901960784314
5940071,5,B00ESGGAYM,So glad they finally released the rest of these seasons. One of my favorite shows!,1456012800,,82,4.533333333333333
5940072,5,B00ESGGAYM,My wife and I have been hooked on this series since retiring.  For some reason this season we did not see many of the shows. It had a great price and came with the ussal speed of Amazon Prime,1455408000,,191,3.8974358974358974

5940076,5,B00ESGGAYM,"I ordered this as well as the other seasons of Diagnosis Murder, so that I can own the entire set. Every season is great in my opinion, and Dick Van Dyke is a great talent, no matter what character he is playing. As the well respected Dr. He does a wonderful job, as does his son playing the homicide detective. This is great fit nostalgia fans, or those new to the show, who appreciate good television from past years. Tons of cameos from other famous actors from the past, in every season. One of the strongest storylines of the show is from season 6-7. If you are a Dick Van Dyke fan, and don't mind the campiness of older shows, which some episodes have, but I like that, then get this series. Spin off show of Jake and the Fat Man. Another success at starring an older comedian from a former popular sitcom, in their own crime show. It worked for Andy Griffith, Carrol O'Connor, and it worked well for Dick Van Dyke also.",1447286400,3,926,4.327586206896552

5940079,2,B00ESGGAYM,"I'm a big fan of the Diagnosis Murder series  --  but the sixth season is my least favorite.

 I was very disappointed in these episodes.  They were long on talk and short on mystery.",1441152000,,183,4.264705882352941
5940080,1,B00ESGGAYM,"Sorrythis was faulty ,had to return it",1436918400,,38,4.571428571428571
5940081,4,B00ESGGAYM,"Dick Van Dyke has had a remarkable career in show business. Best known as a comic actor from his legendary ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" in the early 1960's, he went on to long running success as a doctor/sleuth in ""Diagnosis Murder"". The episodes are fun to watch and entertaining, combining mystery, crime solving and some humor along the way. Highly recommended.",1436227200,2,356,4.852459016393443
5940082,3,B00ESGGAYM,I can only give this 3 stars because I had to return it because one of the disks would only play two of the four shows then stop completely.  We had purchased this same season from Costco twice with the exact same problem a few months ago and returned them as well.  Apparently a production problem with at least one disk.  We never watched the rest of the disks unsure if it would create a problem for our player.  Maybe this season will be remanufactured in the future and we'll try again since we always enjoyed the series.,1434499200,3,526,4.336734693877551

5940085,5,B00ESGGAYM,Great.,1429488000,,6,6.0
5940086,4,B00ESGGAYM,"Another reviewer wrote this was the most imaginative season and I have to agree.
I do fault these DVDs for not having closed-caption capabilities.  You cannot even use the closed-caption feature on your own television by hooking up the DVD to the 3-color (non-HD) cables.  With some DVDs, that is a good workaround but not on these.  That's a shame for us older viewers.  And honestly, there is always some dialogue that even the youngest viewer can't make out, no matter how many times you repeat a scene.  All DVDs should have closed captions (and/or English subtitles).",1429228800,4,572,4.855670103092783

5940106,5,B00ESGGAYM,"Diagnosis Murder was a consistently solid show including a very likeable cast headed by the incomparable Dick Van Dyke. Earlier seasons of the show while very solid, were relatively conventional in their plot lines where a murder occurs and then suspects are questioned. As the show matured, more and more interesting stories occured and Season 6 marked perhaps the high point in creativity for the show. The season includes stories where a corpse on the autopsy table comes to life; a wrong number call by a kidnapper to Dr. Sloane (Dick Van Dyke) ends in the unexpected death of a relative of the kidnap victim; aliens could be the cause of the disappearance of one of the regular cast; a serial killer is on the loose in the Hospital where Dr. Sloane works and a new victim pops up every hour on the hour; a murder is witnessed online over a webcam in what was a ground breaking episode at a time when the internet was still relatively new. The season is filled with interesting stories where you truly do not know what to expect from one show to the next. The action is generally fast paced, and the season would hold up well when compared to current shows in its pacing.

You won't go wrong with this thoroughly enjoyable and charming show.",1408579200,8,1245,4.582959641255606
5940107,5,B00ESGGAYM,Very good DVD season series. When played on a tv set looks like original broadcasted version. But some dvd may not work in portable or dvd burners. All works fine on a table top DVD player. Good buy.,1408406400,,199,4.2631578947368425
