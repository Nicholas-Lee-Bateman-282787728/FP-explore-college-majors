7873078,5,6304450990,"Ru Paul should have dedicated this song to Samantha Fox. This video is fabulous and shows a self-confident and straight lady posing very sexy but always tasteful and sophisticated.  There is hardly anyone in this world  able to pose as sexy without being tacky and to move her mouth in that foxy  glamorous way. ""Calendar Girl"" gives an insight of the making-of  Sam's Calendar 1997. The locations are very beautiful (Cancun, Mexico) and  also Sam's make-up and her sexy (and tiny) clothes are very well picked.  But not only shows the video great modeling, it also shows a bit of Sam's  impressing personality and her effervescent nature. The interview sections  are very interesting and show a very self-confident and mature but still  fresh and lively Sam. The whole video is combined with some of the trax of  Sam's latest album ""21st century Fox"". The picked songs make the  whole video even more entertaining because they are very fresh and really  fit in the whole scene.",963187200,3,978,4.86060606060606
