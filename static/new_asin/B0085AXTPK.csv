5132762,5,B0085AXTPK,"This is a bluray reissue of the original 2011 dvd release which garnered much praise when it came out. I have not seen that dvd, but this new bluray is special indeed!

It is no secret that Franz Welser-Most has his own special way with Bruckner. This is the original complete Nowak (1887) version of the 8th. Symphony, taking all of 90 minutes, The fact that Welser-Most can keep its pulse intact for the whole duration, while not ignoring the nuances of a sensitive interpretation, is no mean feat, and this performance never loses its impetus. The Clevelanders are on top of their game. It's hard to single out any section - they're all brilliant in this music.

The glorious Adagio is 30 minutes of pure beauty - just exquisite. The opening fanfare of brass and timpani in the finale will make your hair stand on end, and it doesn't seem anticlimactic through the rest of the movement. The first allegro is well paced and the scherzo (not one of Bruckner's strongest, in my opinion)is played to the hilt.

Welser-Most's conducting style is restrained, but his eyes say a lot, and his arm and body movements are graceful (the polar opposite of Bernstein, say). He understands Bruckner's musical demands, and uses the reverb. time of the hall to determine his choice of tempi. The resultant audio here is wonderful - that real full ""cathedral of sound"" so essential to a great Bruckner performance - as opposed to the rather analytical sound with short reverb on the new Abbado/Lucerne Bruckner 5.

The video is very good but not perfect - a bit too much color saturation from some cameras (too orange). Split-screen shots are used sparingly, but effectively.

A nice touch here was the interview not only with the conductor, but with  William Cosel, recording director, who has been around the block a few times when it comes to recording concerts. Cosel introduced all his cameramen individually, from their vantage points in the hall - a generous gesture. Welser-Most is always instructive in his interviews without lecturing.

The only other video I have seen of #8 is the Wand(2000) on TDK. It uses the 1890 Haas version, and also takes 90 minutes, but somehow it seems longer. Perhaps this is an old man's last attempt at the piece versus Welser-Most's more thrusting traversal.

I hope the Welser-Most ninth appears on bluray also, and it sure would be nice to get a fourth and sixth from this same source.

Well worth $30 of anybody's money!",1344124800,6,2451,4.775413711583925

The conductor I had not heard of before, but he does great justice to this, one of the greatest and most mellifluous of Bruckner's symphonies.

This is the 2nd disc ( also No7 ) in this series I have complained about the picture quality, it also shows on trailers on other ARTHAUS discs , audio quality apart the idea of Blu-Ray is excellent video.",1463011200,,446,4.137931034482759

8525453,4,B0085AXTPK,"I know all Bruckner by many conductors. Most of them use the Haas version.  We can scarcely know which were Bruckners actual intentions, since there are many versions based upon ""original sketches"".
  Those who are not accostumed to Bruckner could reach an ecstasy before this Nowak edition of the 8th, his doubtless masterpiece.
  I am a Brucknerian addict since  45 years and I know his cycles under several conductors, being almost all Haas versions, rather than Nowak's.  May be I am conditioned by ""Haas standard"" as it have got quite a stereotype.
  Cleveland performance seems to be excellent, however we would hardly know where some ""clumsy"" sounds  by timpani and woods are created by Nowak or by the conductor.
  Without handling the score it s hard to assure whether we feel  this interpretation a little awkward due to Nowak s revision or due to Welser-Most  conducting, once we, listeners, may have ears ""constructed"" by Haas edition.
  Nowak has changed most the clmax and codas, as well as some harmonies and instrumentation. We can recognize 97% of the ""script"" we are familiar to, however sometimes we feel ""This is not the Bruckner I know"".
  I don t know why Welser Most has chosen Nowak edition. Of course ,it is a  musical curiosity anyway...

  PORTUGUES:  Conheo Bruckner com muitos regentes, a maioria usando as verses Haas. Dificilmente sabemos as intenoes do compositor, porque h muitos ""manuscritos originais"". Os nao acostumados com Bruckner podero ter xtases ante esta verso Nowak da Oitava, sua indubitvel obra mxima.  Sou bruckneriano fantico h 45 anos e conheo seus ciclos sob diversos regentes, muito mais em edies Haas do que Nowak.  Talvez eu esteja condicionado pelo padro ""Haas"",que se estereotipou.
A interpretao de Cleveland soa excelente, mas nunca saberei,sem a partitura, se uma estranha leitura de tmpanos e madeiras se deve a Nowak ou ao condutor. Difcil assegurar se o que sentimos meio ""desajeitado""  criao de  Nowak ou do regente, porque ns podemos estar com ouvidos ""construdos"" pela verso Haas.
Nowak mudou principalmente climaxes e codas, alm de harmonias e instrumentao. Em 97% do discurso, reconhecemos o ""script"", mas por vezes sentimos ""Este no  o Bruckner que eu conheo"".
 Nao sei por que Welser-Most escolheu Nowak. Sem dvida, de  qq forma,  uma curiosidade musical.

8525454,3,B0085AXTPK,"While the DTS master audio is superb it unfortunately only serves to highlight the failings of this performance. Welser-Most appears to lack the energy and raw power that I feel the work demands. The Cleveland Orchestra is accomplished and turns in a competent performance but I was left with the feeling that the lack of ""voomah"" from the man on the podium saw the players well within themselves - workmanlike rather than inspired. I compared it to the Karajan performance from his DG cycle (the benchmark in my book) and was rivetted to my chair from the opening bars and not released until the closing ones. I was left fantasizing about hearing the HVK recording in DTS HD .... but alas.",1392681600,3,690,4.710743801652892

8525456,5,B0085AXTPK,"Before listening to and viewing the Franz Welser-Most DVD of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8, I had never heard the original version of this symphony.  Although I prefer the revised version commonly performed, Welser-Most's interpretation of the original,  the playing of the Cleveland Orchestra and the visual effects are all first rate.  Had I not been able to view the DVD, I might never have seen a Wagner Tuba, and instrument completely unfamiliar to me.  Overall, a great experience.  Highly recommended.",1364169600,,504,5.25
8525457,4,B0085AXTPK,"This Blu-ray captures an excellent performance of the Bruckner 8th.  Welser-Most avoids the pitfalls of Bruckner by smoothing out the harsh dynamic transitions which can bog down some performances.  The sound is very good although some instruments like timpani are muted.  The look of Severance Hall where the performance was filmed provides a beautiful backdrop.  The video has some annoying qualities, however, like the amateurish editing choice to show two or three performers in small boxes rather than fading in and out between them.  Overall, it is a quality production.",1356652800,,576,5.355555555555555
8525458,5,B0085AXTPK,"For twenty years I have admired Franz Welser-M&ouml;st (has an umlaut) as a Brucknerian. He was born in Linz, the hometown of Bruckner, and Bruckner's musical vocabulary is like mother's milk to him. Back then, when he still looked like a child but was thirty years of age, his Brucknerian instincts were veiled behind a natural reserve. He let just enough out to achieve the desired results and no more. When the acoustics rang, when the reverb died down, Franz was back in his shell again, not to come out again until there was another climactic arpeggio. Maybe working in America has been good for him, because it has given him permission to express what he feels. Clearly his presence has been good for the American orchestra, too.
During and after the Second World War, emigr&eacute;; conductors built up the orchestras of the USA to the highest international standards, not just in the big venues of Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston and New York, but also in places like Minneapolis, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. Stereo recording came along in time to capture some of those orchestras at their peak. Abravanel's Mahler cycle from Salt Lake, for example, is a national treasure. Everest, Living Stereo and Mercury used the best technology of the time to capture some of the best musicianship.
Now Welser-M&ouml;st seems to be bringing Cleveland back to the highest levels again. For several years he has been releasing on DVD first a Bruckner Seventh, then a Fifth and then an Eighth. I was underwhelmed by the recorded sound of the Seventh and Fifth, both of which start pianissimo, and the engineers kept the recording level so low (to mask crowd noise) that the opening bars were inaudible. One could see Welser-M&ouml;st conducting and listening to something, but there was no sound to be heard in my living room. So I passed on the DVD release of the Eighth last year. It's one of my favorite symphonies, but I had so many already, and who needed another if the sound was going to be flimsy?
Then comes the blu-ray, and I cannot resist getting it, though my hopes were modest. I was just willing to give it a chance. It arrived a couple of weeks ago, and only tonight I sat down to watch it while having a snack. Boy, did it reach out and grab me by the lapels and hold me in my seat for ninety minutes! The audio here was everything that it had not been on the DVD releases. In my present enthusiasm I am inclined to say that this is the best recording of the Eighth in my collection. Now don't get me wrong--I am passionate about Celibidache's Bruckner, which fits him like glove on hand. Celibidache believed in the music between the notes, and no composer puts more music there than Bruckner does. So they are naturals together. The recent release of Bruckner's Seventh conducted by Celibidache on blu-ray is a major event. You don't have any trouble hearing the pianissimo notes at the beginning on that blu-ray!
And I admire very much the achievements of Wand, along with Karajan and Jochum and B&ouml;hm and Solti as Brucknerians. The latter like Welser-M&ouml;st received their musical training in the Austro-Hungarian tradition to which Bruckner belonged. They too feel the impulse and know what to do with it. I do not wish to bring them down by lifting Welser-M&ouml;st up, but only to say that he has risen to the ranks of their constellation, and he has brought the Clevelanders up there with him. Some of them also brought their orchestras to greater Brucknerian heights, Celibidache in Munich, Wand in Hamburg, Solti in Chicago.
Welser-M&ouml;st is still young by conducting standards, and could have forty years ahead of him if he reaches the age of some of them. His Bruckner is likely to continue growing during that time, and he may yet reach heights that no one else has ever obtained. He may become the greatest Brucknerian of all time, after the composer himself. He is not there yet, but he is on the verge. Now I hope that I can hear him conduct in person some time. I have had no desire to hear Bruckner in a concert hall since the death of Celibidache. Now the urge has returned. Perhaps a pilgrimage to Cleveland would be in order. And the Clevelanders themselves are likely to continue growing with him. This is going to be really exciting!
As for this Bruckner performance itself, Welser-M&ouml;st favors the Nowak edition--but there actually are two Nowak editions, the 1955 edition based on the 1890 manuscript, and the 1973 edition based on the longer 1887 manuscript. Hardly ever does anyone specify which Nowak edition they mean, but one or the other of them is favored by many of the greats like Giulini and Celibidache. Karajan and Furtw&auml;ngler used the 1938 Haas edition, which was a reconciliation of all the materials. Furtw&auml;ngler died before Nowak published either of his editions, but Karajan held on to the Haas edition to the very end. Karajan and others like the leanness of the Haas, just as Celibidache and others love the expansiveness of the Nowak.
The video director deserves high praise for finding the right close-ups at all the right times, his use of double-screen with duets, triple-screen with trios, which are not very common in this score but speak more clearly when you can see the principal players side-by-side. He has a lot of cameras to work with, maybe as many as the microphones, but each segment is planned out carefully, gently craning and zooming to keep the visual component in a rhythm similar to Bruckner's music. The clarity of the blu-ray picture is amazing.
Best sound of any Eighth. Best picture of any Eighth. Best direction of any Eighth. As good a performance as any other recorded Eighth has yet achieved. I am going off to check out Furtw&auml;ngler again now. See you later.
POST-SCRIPT
I'm back. Furtw&auml;ngler didn't work for me. He relaxes the tempo on soft passages and tenses it during loud ones. No one does Bruckner like this any more today, and they are right not to do so. I checked out a few of my other recordings: B&ouml;hm and Vienna have wonderful strings that unfortunately do not match today's recording standards. Martin Sieghart has an exceptional DVD-Audio recorded in 192 killiwhampas with a fine sense of airiness around all the notes; the Bruckner Linz Orchestra know what they are doing, but the recording is stereo only, and the disc is OOP in Japan, where it was issued. The only recording I have that matches Welser-M&ouml;st sonically is G&uuml;nter Wand with the Berliners on SACD from Japan. Fabulous. I have realized that I need more recordings of this symphony, and am ordering the recent Blomstedt, Janowski and Thielemann recordings. Will know more when they arrive. Bye again.",1345248000,3,6766,4.813573883161512
8525459,5,B0085AXTPK,"Welser-Most has been supported by a major Upper Austrian bank for over 25 years now as a cultural envoy. This level of support suggests that Welser-Most has something special to offer in terms of Austrian music especially. Those who know his recent Summer Night's Gala or the 2011 New Year's Day concert with the VPO will also be aware that he can produce very lively responses from his orchestra too.

This recording is a performance of the original version of this symphony and is given a performance of considerable splendour. The description of 'Cathedrals in sound' is easy to comprehend here. There are several later versions of the symphony which may be more familiar but all compromise Bruckner's original concept as recorded here and which Welser-Most now believes to be the best.

I have grown to like this edition and interpretation very much indeed over several viewings. I would view Welser-Most's performance as typically having a very clear long-term view of structure held under tight control but driven by a deeply held conviction. The climaxes are massive but this is balanced by considerable moments of delicacy. The orchestra is well able to deliver at this level.

The concert is well recorded and presented in DTS 5.1 surround and stereo sound formats. The sound in its DTS format is particularly spectacular in effect. The camera work is detailed without being invasive. The imaging is very crisp and of good colour definition. There is some occasional use of multiple imaging in this production which is intended to show more than one view at a time.

This seems to me to be a very fine entry in what is building to be a very significant series with a very personal and justifiable choice of editions. The standard of music making is of a consistently high calibre as is the recording quality. Welser-Most himself is clearly dedicated to his task and I would therefore suggest that this will give purchasers much pleasure and food for thought. A 5 star rating seems totally reasonable therefore.

Further suggestions for extra listening:
For those who might be further interested in more of Welser-Most's performances I would strongly recommend his Mozart Cosi fan Tutte and his Lehar Merry Widow (in German and with wonderfully vibrant acting as well as singing). Those who know his recent Summer Night's Gala or the 2011 New Year's Day concert with the VPO will also be aware that he can produce very lively responses from his musicians as appropriate to the occasion.",1345075200,,2494,4.94272076372315
