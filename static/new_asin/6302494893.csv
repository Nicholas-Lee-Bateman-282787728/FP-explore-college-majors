7827637,5,6302494893,"a live concert with Julie Andrews...boy could she sing. it is so sad that she can no longer sing out. it would feel like being blinded to me, an art major, to loose your very best at least important gift. in this concert from PBS she does sing Berlington Bertie and tells the story of the song from the old vaudeville of England. i first saw that song in the movie the Star and it is a hoot. i miss musical comedy like this, and her voice is still the prettiest one ever in entertainment. clear as a bell and high on the scale. just beautiful.",1361664000,,543,4.132075471698113
7827638,5,6302494893,"What can you say about one of the best actresses/singers in this world? Julie's voice is like no other and her beauty goes way beyond.  I am hoping to get this in DVD or better yet blu ray.  This is so good but not long enough.
Julie leaves me in awe.",1335571200,,251,3.9019607843137254
7827639,5,6302494893,"This is a must for the Julie Andrews fan.  Watching Julie in concert, singing some of her most favorite songs, is truly 60 minutes of true entertainment.  Julie really gives it her all in this concert.  She talks to the audience a bit about her upbringing and experience in the English music halls at the end of that era.  She is very warm and humble in her presentation. Her choice of songs is delectable and her singing is pure and clear as a silver bell.
Now that this wonderful voice can no longer sing in the manner we have all admired, a true Julie fan better scoop this up while they can.  We will not hear Julie sing like this ever again- sadly so.",1197849600,,656,4.258064516129032

This is the same concert as the DVD titled ""live in concert"", which is already out of stock. Buy this one! You'll love it!",1135900800,2,176,4.5
7827642,5,6302494893,"This is such a great VHS, I only wish she had these very songs on a CD....She is full of energy and passion for what she sings. Oh do I miss her voice, what a tragedy. But at least we have the rememberances. Come back to us in movies Julie, you can act as this video shows us that you can.",1116374400,,289,3.7540983606557377
7827643,5,6302494893,"Many have the image of a soft spoken young lady dancing across the hills in Switzerland. In this video, that image is smashed... and smashing it is! People have spoken of her octave range in her voice but have not spoken of her ability to move from a soft, sweet melody to belting out a great tune with the best of them. The viewer can see Julie blossom right before their eyes as she moves from a soft ""How to Handle a Woman"" (from her broadway appearance in Camelot) to ""Le Jazz Hot"" (from her movie/broadway appearances in Victor/Victoria). She is classy, sassy, and brassy with her selections. She interjects spots from her life that will bring tears to your eyes both in laughter and sorrow. One wonderful surprise is a tape of her singing as a child performer. Her performance brings the audience to their feet a number of times. I can guarantee that the viewers' heart will be filled with the sound of music before the video ends.",1008028800,14,937,4.517647058823529
7827644,5,6302494893,"The first time I watch movie "" the Sound of  Music, I like it very much. The sound of music makes my heart beat with joy. Especially, I like the actress. She is charming, she is gifted, she is beautiful. I like her  singing.  When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I am feeling  sad, I simply remember my favourate things, then I don't feel so bad.  Each time, I feel lonely, I will listen to the songs in ""the sound of  music"", it makes me relaxed I have watched this movie at least 10  times.",951868800,2,501,4.051020408163265
