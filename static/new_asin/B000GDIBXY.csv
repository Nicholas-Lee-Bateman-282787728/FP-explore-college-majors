2605300,5,B000GDIBXY,"...This is a fantastic and essential box set for the true genre fan. I have a few minor gripes, though. It seems that the first 5 discs were just repackages of overstocked copies of the original 4 films, as the disc of the first film is still the original one-disc edition, even though a 2-disc was recently released, and I want to know WHERE ON EARTH the completely uncut version of Toxie 2 is! Japan got it, I heard rumors of it being in the Tox Box, but it seems I'll NEVER get to see it...Oh well. This is still the best deal out there.",1210204800,6,540,4.152380952380953
2605301,5,B000GDIBXY,"This is quite the amazing bargain. 4 of the best movies ever for one low price! Also included is the entire run of the Toxic Crusaders cartoon, which is a great way to introduce children to the Tromaverse. Did I forget to mention these are the director's cuts? BECAUSE THEY ARE! You get to see exactly what world famous director Lloyd Kaufman envisioned. Truly amazing cinematic art. You want to see some movies? Get this set. You want to be treated like an idiot for 4 hours, go get Lord of the Rings instead.",1209600000,,510,4.4361702127659575

The DVD case has hard leaves for all the movie DVDs the toons come in a separate DVD case.
Yep, they are the directors cuts. There are plenty of scenes that were not on TV. Plenty of interaction on the DVD also if you like that sort of stuff.
I just like the movies.
Nice set.",1209600000,4,351,3.888888888888889
2605303,5,B000GDIBXY,"All episodes of the rare and impossible to find Toxic Crusaders TV series are featured in this 7-disc set. Only 4 have been previously released on DVD and getting the entire 13 episodes alone is worth the very affordable price of this set.

But, apart from that, of course the director's cut versions of the four classic Toxic Avenger films are included as well, along with the feature length documentary ""Apocalypse Soon: The Making of Citizen Toxie"", making this the most complete, affordable and essential set of any great filmfranchise.

You may have one or more of Toxies films already, and to be honest, without at least the first one no collection of important horror films can be taken seriously. (You might even, and possibly mistakenly, have picked up the R-rated version of the best film in the batch: Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger part IV"".) But in any case you do yourself a big favour buying this box-set. Even if you are lucky enough to already own the (now discontinued) Tox Box you should get this new released COMPLETE TOXIC AVENGER set, not only because of the low price the complete Toxic Crusaders series and the Unrated Director's Cut versions of all included titles, but also because you could use bot boxes as beautiful bookends to mark your collection of Troma-films. And one simply can't have too much of Lloyd Kaufman's unique creation.

Don't forget to also read the unputdownable ""The Toxic Avenger: The Novel"", by the infatiguable Lloyd Kaufman and Adam Jahnke.",1157414400,31,1494,4.874015748031496

2605306,5,B000GDIBXY,"Amazing set! It has great quality versions of all the Toxic Avenger movies. I especially love that it has the Crusaders cartoons. It's even turned my 8 year old son into a Toxie fan. He walks around the house singing the theme song, and always wants to watch it, even more then the cartoons of his generation. Exactly what I wanted when looking to buy a set. Also, the only place I was able to find the cartoons. It's really awesome to see him watch the same cartoons I used to have to rent off the video store shelf after the show went off TV. Obviously he isn't watching the Toxic Avenger movies yet, but I'm sure when he gets older he'll love them just as much.

Great DVD's, I paid a nice price (I know the price fluctuates so I don't  know what it's currently listed at), and has everything I wanted in a set.",1458950400,,814,4.211538461538462

2605316,5,B000GDIBXY,I seen the toxic avenger when i was 11 and loved it When I saw this deal now that iam older I knew I had to grab it. The set is very very presentable And the dvds of the movies -about five discs in one box- are beautifully displayed in this very durable plastic dvd box. The dvds are the uncensored edtion Even Part 2  which was a common grip of earlier releases. All the dvds themselves have a introduction by Lloyd Kaufman -Uncle Lloydie-. I was actually excited To see the Toxic Crusaders cartoon every single episode from it one and only season which was a  shame. Long Story short basicly All the movies are all uncensored and all the episodes of the cartoon. So a little something something for the family,1408579200,,711,4.338345864661654

2605319,5,B000GDIBXY,"I never write Amazon reviews but felt I should on this one to clear something up. I was really hesitant to buy this set because of all the talk about it not containing the uncut version of Part 2. I almost went with the Tox Box instead just to be safe but I took a gamble with this one. Sure enough to my surprise the version of Part 2 I got was 100% uncut and I listened to the commentary by Lloyd Kaufman and he referenced it as being the Tox Box edition. So from what I can tell the very early versions of this box set included the edited one and after feedback from the fans they included the Uncut version. Unfortunately there is no indication on the box of this so you just have to pop it in the dvd player and hope for the best. To help out I recommend you fast forward it to the ""Wheelchair scene"" near the beginning to see which version you got. So hopefully this will help someone out there who was hesitant to buy this like I was at first because of this issue.

Now to talk about the set. It's absolutely perfect. I loved the Toxic Crusaders show when I was a little kid and never saw any of the movies until just earlier this year in fact. I fell in love pretty quickly with Troma's bizarre humor and the fact that anything goes with them. The set includes all 4 movies and the complete series of Toxic Crusaders. As of this writing I have not seen part 3 because I heard a lot of mixed opinions on that one and went straight to part 4. I'm not going to review them here because others have already done that better than I ever could. So definitely buy this set if you're a Toxie fan.",1399593600,4,1597,4.085987261146497

2605324,5,B000GDIBXY,"This is a SECRET, GUILTY pleasure to say the least.  Troma is not known for throwing tons of money into their movies, and less known for making movies that even have a snowballs chance in hell of standing up to movie critic scrutiny.

But...despite this, Troma has a large fanbase.  It has survived all these years and may still be making movies.  I remember some ""zombie chicken"" film that came out no more than 6 years ago.  Why do people like Troma films?  Alchohal may play a part, along with...other substances.  But the biggest factor is just the shock value in the movies.  This studio seems to follow the formula of ""so bad it's good.""  This does make since, think about it.  When a film passes itself off as a work of gold, and really thinks it is good AND is marketed like it will be, once you watch it and feel different, you are FURIOUS to say the least.  I remember going to see 'Funny People', with Adam Sandler.  You would swear by the commercials that this was going to be the comedy of the summer.  This is the only film I can think of that I was 99 percent close to getting up and walking out.  If my feet had not been stuck to the theater floor on some really old spilt soda, I just may have.

But when a film just blatently trys to be stupid and down right awful, people seem to have an inverse reaction to viewing it.  They in fact love it, they tell their friends how BAD this movie was and how they MUST see it also.  The film explodes and gets a cult following very fast.

'Toxic Avenger' is a prime example of this.  I personally watched the cartoon series in the 1990's and thought this was all there was.  Upon growing up and seeing there was films also, I had to give the first one a see.  I literally could not believe my eyes.  Arms getting ripped off, sex left and right, how bad the acting was, and that HORRIBLE death of a child on a bicycle.  This movie right or wrong shocks you.

Is this garbage, YES.  Are there things in it that shouldn't be, YES, namely the unnecessary death of that child in the first film.  Also when the Toxic Avenger is having sex with his blind girlfriend, that's weird also...

In the end, this is love it or hate it.  If you love films so bad, that you find yourself unable to look away, this franchise is for you.  If your lucky enough to have more cultered tastes, good for you, (I envy you), check out the 'Iron Lady'.  I've heard that is a really good film.

In conclusion, all the films PLUS the entire cartoon series!!!  If this is a must own for you, this set is the one to own to add to your secret stash.

Now if you'll excuse I am going to go watch 'Masterpiece Theater' and get some culture...",1335225600,2,2667,4.207509881422925
2605325,5,B000GDIBXY,"The toxic avenger is one of those small time movies that was made poorly, gore filled, and original to say the least. It went completely mainstream, and became a cartoon for a whole season. You get this whole legacy about our mutilated malice murdering super mutant hero some of us grew up with, and still fondly enjoy in my case, all on one complete box set. Everything came exactly as I expected, the toxic avenger. Anyone who's into b rated horror should consider this one a serious investment in laughter and over all good time factor for the kids and the adults out there, but don't let the kids check the movies out til they're a little older its got my 9 outta 10 just because not all are unrated but you can introduce your older youngins to TAII just because of that.

2605327,5,B000GDIBXY,"The following is a quadruple review for all four movies in the ""Toxic Avenger"" series.
These might contain spoilers, justa headsup, so don't get angry if I give anything away.
Also in this review I'll be discussing the ""Toxic Crusaders"" ABC Saturday Morning cartoon.

The Toxic Avenger

Released in 1984, ""The Toxic Avenger"" is quite possibly the best independent, low-budget movies ever made. The plot is fairly simple: A nerdy guy named Melvin working at a health spa accidentally falls in a barrel of toxic waste, which transforms him into a a hideously hero with superhuman size and strength. He proceeds to hunt down, and punish criminals in the harshest ways possible (the Taco Bell scene springs to mind) and not only does he give the criminals their just deserts, he tortures and brutally maims them in the process, rightfully so. He is backed up by his friends who all support him and he has to do battle with virtually every criminal outside Manhattan, in the small town of Tromaville, until it all comes to a big climax fight with the corrupt mayor. All in all, it's a darn fine film, made by an incredibly talented director, Lloyd Kaufman, who I had the pleasure of meeting at a book signing at a local shopping mall. If you like gore, superheroes, Troma, be absolutely sure to check out ""The Toxic Avenger!""

The Toxic Avenger II

My personal favorite in the series. The movie starts off with Toxie, five years after the events of ""The Toxic Avenger,"" who is working at a community center for the blind, when he recieves a mysterious package, which turns out to be a bomb from an evil corporation known as ""Apocalypse Inc,"" who want to take over the small burg of Tromaville. This is followed by an incredible explosion, which in turn is followed by one of the longest choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen in any medium, where Toxie fights off about twenty-five bad guys, one by one. I don't want to give too much away, but Toxie is lured to Japan, where he learns his long-lost father is living, he fights bad guys in Japan, and finds his father, who turns out not to be what he expected. One thing leads to another and Toxie comes home to America, where he has to fight even more bad guys and then there's this chase scene between a Taxi Cab driven by a disgruntled cabbie, in the backseat is Toxie, sandwiched between an equally disgruntled old married couple, and they chase a man on a motorcycle with nitroglycerin strapped to him, who is planning on blowing up City Hall. Again, I don't want to give too much away, but in my humble opinion, ""The Toxic Avenger II"" is the best in the series, it also ends on something of a cliffhanger. It's just a great, fun movie in general, so check it out if you liked the original.

The Toxic Avenger III: The Last Temptation Of Toxie

With one of the most brilliant opening scenes I've ever seen, ""Toxic Avenger 3"" is a bit of a letdown after the first twenty minutes or so. It has its moments, but for the most part, it tries too hard. This was actually the first Troma movie I ever saw, and I loved it at the time, but I had no idea that Troma made movies that were a hundred times better than this. Aside from the opening scene and the grand finale, this movie is kind of boring and repetitive. Picking up where ""Toxic Avenger 2"" left off, the chairman of Apocalypse Inc is trying to bring down Toxie in various ways, but he finally convinces Toxie to work for him for a huge sum of money which will pay for his (Toxie's) girlfriend's eye-replacement surgery, enabling her to see for the first time in her life. Not much else to it, other than it's unusual length for a Troma movie, I believe the running time is a little over two hours. It may be the weakest in the series, but that doesn't preventing me from loving it. But trust me when I say this one's for fans only.

The Toxic Avenger IV: Citizen Toxie

My least favorite in the series, like ""Class of Nuke 'Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown,"" I was heavily distracted when I watched this one, so it's hard for me to give it a fair review. It came out in 2000, boasting the tagline ""The Real Sequel,"" which I thought was a little unfair because parts 2 and 3 weren't that bad. The plot follows Toxie, who gets mixed up with an evil counterpart known as ""Noxie,"" who wreaks havoc on the good people of Tromaville. The one thing I did like about this movie is the fact that they brought back (who I think to be) the original 'voice' of Toxie, who has a much more booming, powerful and commanding voice than the guy from parts 2 and 3. Unfortunately, I didn't see as much in this movie as I did the others, and I feel Troma's place in the universe was really in the 80s and 90s, the year 2000 seemed to destroy a lot of good mediums, from movies to video games, it all went downhill by 2001. But I digress. There was one thing I really liked about this movie, and that was former pornstar Ron Jeremy as the mayor of Tromaville, who, despite being a pornstar, is actually a pretty good actor in general, and I see why they picked him for a few of their movies. All in all, this one is regarded by many as 'The Real Sequel,' and that might be so, but it just didn't hit the spot for me the way those first three did. Check it out, but approach with caution.

Toxic Crusaders

Though I haven't had a chance to watch all thirteen episodes yet, I have seen the first two, and will say that they're really the kind of cartoon I dig-- the late 80s, early 90s style that boasted lots of action and morals and happy endings to boot. For some reason, this show never made it into syndication, for the life of me, I don't know why; it's like ""Captain Planet,"" but not as horribly preachy in it's environmental tone (which is actually very subtle). The animation resembles the original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" cartoons, which follow a similar plot. I feel privileged to be able to watch this show, it's like seeing a lost gem that was never put on proper display. Goofy as it may be, I really like what I've seen of this little cartoon and will keep on watching it. I think this one's only available in the ""Complete Toxic Avenger"" boxed set, which I bought, but I may be wrong, definitely check it out if you can find it.

Well, there you have it, my review for all four ""Toxic Avenger"" movies and the cartoon.
These movies are really good and are very creative, they're awesome in every way.
Like I said, if you like Troma, superheroes or blood and guts, be sure to check them out!",1258502400,6,6494,4.394342762063228
2605328,4,B000GDIBXY,"Hello! I'm looking after a set like this for a long time, and it looks pretty awesome my question is...
Does the dvds have any subtitles on it??
Can anybody tell?
Thanks!",1213833600,,170,4.34375
2605329,5,B000GDIBXY,"Where would we be without ""The Toxic Avenger""? (""He's stressin' me Julie, he's stressin' me!"") There would be no Tromaville, there would be no (Class of Nuke `Em High, Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D., Tromeo and Juliet, Terror Firmer, Citizen Toxie or even ""Tales from the Crapper""). Thanks to ""Toxie"" (""The first creature of superhuman size and strength from New Jersey"") we have a Troma and he has put ""Tromaville"" on the map. A lot of people call them Z-grade movies, put down the actor's, scripts, story lines, special effects, director's, their way of filming or the fact they even (still) exist. (""All right everybody, drop your tacos or I'll blow your brains out."") Well because of this movie ""The Toxic Avenger"" they still exist. (""No ticky no washy!"") They have plenty of other ""killer"" movies but if it wasn't for ""Toxie"" (""And you can tell all your scum friends that things are gonna change in this town. I'm not just another pretty face!"") there might not have been any of those other ""TROMA classics"".

Definitely a MUST BUY (but do yourself a big favor and buy it from Toxie himself at the TROMA website where it comes with a lobby card that is signed by Toxie's creator & Troma's president Lloyd Kaufman and also by the other half of TROMA, the elusive Michael Herz). It's like $5.00 more but you will have  THE COMPLETE TOXIC AVENGER set signed!!!! The one you get from Amazon (or Best Buy or wherever) does not come with the signed lobby card. That is only from TROMA. Plus you will be getting it directly from Toxie's creators. With this set you get all 4 ""Toxic Avenger"" films plus the complete ""Toxic Crusaders"" series, I also have the TOX BOX (with the 3D cover) but this set is still a must have for that series plus the excellent Citizen Toxie film, the best of the 3 sequels by far. If you have the guts (and we know Tromaville Mayor Belgoody had them...literally) you would definitely pick this box set up and support independent filmmaking. And remember ""The next time your in danger or in need of help, look to the horizon and maybe, just maybe, the Toxic Avenger will be there.""",1213142400,3,2098,4.606951871657754

2605331,4,B000GDIBXY,Great box set - nicey packaged and at a reasonable price. My only gripe is that toxic 2 is the R-rated version and is missing many scenes of extreme gore which helped make up for the weakness of the sequel. Even Kaufman points out that this is the cesored version in the audio commentary. A shame that the UNRATED description as pointed out by amazon is a lie. BEWARE!!,1211760000,30,369,4.36231884057971
