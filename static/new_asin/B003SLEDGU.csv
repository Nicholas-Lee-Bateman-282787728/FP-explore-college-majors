There are instances of what, in my opinion, is not the safest gun handling; those cases could/should have been addressed in a post-segment comment from Mr. Ryan.  Nonetheless, this DVD is filled with a variety of alternatingly amusing/scary/appealing characters ... and I wish there was a sequel.",1443139200,,466,5.038961038961039
8404429,5,B003SLEDGU,"Josh Ryan is an intelligent , witty , awesomely funny personality that makes this show truly one of a kind . I and many others
still do not understand why this program did not get picked up for more seasons to come . It would have been and still
would be great entertainment to see JOSH travel across this country selling firearms and meeting good Americans , enjoying the
shooting sports .",1430006400,,390,4.430555555555555
8404430,1,B003SLEDGU,"I saw the pilot for this on DVD.  ""Hidden"" cameras are set up in a gun shop in CO.  Shoppers come in to the store and (off camera) they are obviously coached to engage in entertaining dialog.  The shoppers are game and do their best, and the gun shop owner tries to keep it fun and keep people talking.  Like most reality TV, there is no reason to believe that anything the actor-esque individuals say is real or authentic. At the end of the day, it is not a lot more exciting than watching closed circuit TV footage of people shopping in Walmart.  I think a very limited number of people would find this to be entertaining.

One final question: why did the host/shop owner have an intense fluorescent orange tan?  Was he a Jersey Shore reject?  A space alien?  We may never know.",1396828800,,780,4.361111111111111
8404431,5,B003SLEDGU,"Reality series LOCK 'N LOAD goes inside Josh T. Ryan's Colorado gun shop to scope out who's buying and why. From teenage girls bonding with dad to avid weapon collectors, from veteran police officers to hunting enthusiasts, every customer has a story. LOCK 'N LOAD doesn't take sides or argue a political perspective. Instead, viewers on both sides of the gun debate can watch Ryan wield his quick-draw humor and inherent likability in each exchange, making big-ticket deals over the blasts echoing from the on-site firing range.",1352851200,2,529,5.091954022988506

A Helluva lot better than these Pawn shop BS on the tube!",1298678400,3,131,4.28
8404433,5,B003SLEDGU,This is the first documentary series on guns that didn't make out all gun owners to be Charles W. Whitman in training. Josh is an actor and has a natural sense of timing.,1293580800,3,170,4.181818181818182
