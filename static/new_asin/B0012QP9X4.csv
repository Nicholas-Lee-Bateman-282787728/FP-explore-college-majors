8247342,1,B0012QP9X4,"I always like to try out new and inventive workouts...so I tried this for the 30 days and have to say I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the workouts.  Yes, you do work up a sweat and yes, a few of the exercises are challenging but at the price of over $500...no not worth it.  You'd be better off installing a ballet bar in your home and workout with that.  You'll probably get the same results and a much lesser price.

I wasn't too keen on the inventor also being the main instructor.  And to count off EVERY single move got annoying.  I just couldn't get beyond her counting EVERY move.  Plus, I like it when the instructor moves around the room a little bit, pointing out the movements and what you should or shouldn't do such as positioning - you don't see that here.

Overall, I would NOT purchase this even if it was only $50...Michelle should re-do her videos and be a little less annoying.",1395792000,4,898,4.367469879518072
8247343,5,B0012QP9X4,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD SO I COULD GET A GOOD WORKOUT AT HOME, WHEN I CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE GYM OR GO HIKING. I DON'T HAVE THE BAR. DON'T WANT TO FORK OUT THAT MUCH $$. I USE A BAR STOOL DOWNSTAIRS IN OUR FAMILY ROOM. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRE DVD YET...HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT FAR...IT'S A TOUGH WORKOUT, AT LEAST FOR ME. I AM 56 AND AM STILL A WORK IN PROCESS, BUT I AM GETTING THERE.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD - AND YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT THE EXPENSIVE BAR.",1381622400,8,469,3.69
8247344,5,B0012QP9X4,"i disagree with the writers observation. As a med prof i suggest that All exercise save lives the excuses are never acceptable. Just do it, nothing will ever be accomplished by complaining If the entire prog is unacceptable ask yourselves why but it?",1341878400,9,250,4.837209302325581
8247345,1,B0012QP9X4,Please do not buy this video if you already have the Intermediate or Advance Fluidity videos.  There is absolutely nothing new on this video.  Wish I had known.  You can play the Intermediate video and omit the arms and abs and have the same workout.,1309478400,65,250,4.511111111111111
