8076510,4,B000AA4FBK,"Hermann Goering expressed profound doubts about the wisdom of invading Russia, and argued with Hitler up to the day of the invasion not to do it. So says the British narrator of these German films of bombing operations in the first half of WW2.

It starts in 1936 with the Dornier 23. Quite a sight, looking like a slightly-updated WWI Gotha bomber. The Do-19 and Ju-89 were the 4-engine long range Ural bombers, cancelled in 1936 as the upcoming war was planned to be short, thus no strategic bombing would be needed. Next we see the He-70, later scaled up to the famous He-111. You will see women workers assembling Daimler-Benz engines in the He-111.

Ju-88 coverage dominates. The Ju-88 was of a later generation than its cousins He-111 and Do-17. You will see the Focke-Wulf 200 Condor, a 4-engine former Lufthansa airliner, serving with the U-Boats. They sank 85 ships in conveys, a number greater than the total production of that airplane in 1940 and 1941!

This program gives attention to the ``Recce`` reconaissance) role of Luftwaffe planes. This is Die Deutschen Luftwaffe, Nr. 5 in a series.

There is enough material here for several programs. The second part is Nr. 6 Bombing and Bombing Raids, 1942-1945.",1369353600,,1220,4.850961538461538
8076511,3,B000AA4FBK,"This DVD is an hour long and is based, in terms of video, on German World War 2 newsreel footage. The audio, on the other hand, consists of monotone British narration in a very academic style, akin to a relatively boring undergraduate lecture. The narration provides relatively a relatively good analysis of the bombers themselves and their main activities over this time period. Not deep and profound as one would find in top of the line and lengthy in-depth books published on German bombers of this time period (i.e., like those published by Schiffler) but more akin to relatively short overviews of the aircraft such as those published by Osprey Publishing. If this is the level of analysis on these aircraft the viewer is interested in this DVD will suffice.

The DVD starts off with an overview of the Luftwaffe's main pre-war bombers that were, primarily either just prototypes or failures albeit they did lay the ground for more successful early war bombers such as the JU 88, HE 111 and Dornier DO 17. These bombers are covered in the first 10 minutes or so of the DVD. The remaining time covers the main bombers used in the early part of the war (i.e., JU 88, HE 111 and DO 17). The DVD's main emphasis is on the role and functions performed by these aircraft (including long-range, high altitude and maritime reconnaissance, maritime strike, transport functions and, most importantly, ground support) as well as how well these aircraft fulfilled these roles. In this sense the title of the DVD, ""Bombers and Bombing Raids"", is a little misleading in that strategic raids only accounted for a relatively small portion of what this DVD actually covers.

In short, a DVD geared to providing a decent analytical introduction to the specific aircraft covered (but nothing very in-depth) as opposed to a DVD geared to providing an entertainment experience.",1363305600,,1861,4.904761904761905
8076512,5,B000AA4FBK,"This is an excellent DVD in an excellent series. I do recommend this DVD and the rest of the series of which this video is a part.

The video begins in the prewar era, showing early Luftwaffe bomber aircraft, their experiences in Spain and the origins of German bombing doctrine. It moves on to German bombing operations in the early war period (1939-1942). The video focuses mostly on the primary aircraft used during the period: the HE111, DO17 and JU88 as well as a segment on the FW200 'Condor' in the anti-shipping role.

The video used is from German archives and is generally very good. The video points out that German industry under Nazi rule was very inefficient and significant losses during combat operations during this period could not be made good. Losses during all operations, including in Poland, were significant.

The video shows very important parts of German doctrine that were far more realistic than that of the allies. The most important of which is gaining air superiority as early as possible. We see that the first targets of German bombing operations were enemy airfields. The allies clung to strategic warfare dogma that completely discounted enemy defensive capabilities resulting in high losses for little gain for both RAF Bomber Command as well as USAAF bomber units.

This is a good video those interested in the WWII German Luftwaffe will enjoy and learn from.",1261958400,,1396,4.952991452991453
