An accessible explanation of-and answers to-the hot issues about the historical reliability of Jesus.

Description:

Who was Jesus--really? Has the real Jesus been so buried by tradition and legend that he is now lost to people living in the 21st century?

Historian Dr. John Dickson sets out to discover what we can know for certain about the life of one of history's best known and most influential figures. In a captivating journey across the globe, John Dickson examines ancient documents and consults the world's most respected historians and scholars. Beginning with the Gnostic Gospels, he crisscrosses continents on a search back through time for the historical sources that reveal the real Jesus--a search for the Christ Files.

Filmed in seven countries the documentary reveals the earliest and most important manuscript evidence for Jesus of Nazareth, including the writings of Josephus, Tacitus, the apostle Paul and the controversial Gnostic Gospels. Neither a work of fanciful scepticism nor of Christian propaganda The Christ Files provides viewers with a front row seat to the facts behind Western civilisation's most influential story. Interviews with twelve of the most prominent scholars and historians and access to some of Israel's most important archaeological sites give this documentary a unique authority.

Session One - GNOSTICS AND ROMANS: How the ancient world viewed Jesus of Nazareth
Session Two - JEWS AND CHRISTIANS: Jesus according to his own people
Session Three - LOST SOURCES AND ORAL TRADITIONS: 1st century's most reliable sources about Jesus

John Dickson is a skilled guide. These ""files"" are loaded with information that is fascinating and accessible. Open the drawer and enjoy.
-- Darrell L. Bock, Author, Jesus according to Scripture

In a world of many books about the historical Jesus, there are very few which summarize the historical evidence, Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian, as well and as succinctly as John Dickson does in The Christ Files. The accompanying DVD is also a first rate resource for introducing almost anyone to the discussion about the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith. In an increasingly less Christian world, here is some first rate historical detective work that provides effective presentation without apologizing for the NT evidence. Highly recommended.
-- Ben Witherington III, Professor, Amos Professor of NT for Doctoral Studies, Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, KY

This attractive book is concerned not so much to tell us what can be known about the life of Jesus as rather to help people who want to know how to evaluate by strictly historical methods the conclusions set forth by contemporary writers who present bizarre reconstructions of him and to see how professional ancient historians give us a firm basis for accepting the New Testament documents as reliable sources for what he did and taught. This is a sober, well-informed guide based on sound scholarship.
-- Howard Marshall, Professor, Emeritus Professor of New Testament, University of Aberdeen

John Dickson is an exciting young Australian scholar who has demonstrated his ability to write both at the most sophisticated technical level for fellow New Testament professionals and for the average-level reader with little knowledge of the Bible--and for people virtually anywhere in between. This slim volume aims more at the ordinary reader, to correct popular misconceptions about what historians do and don't know, and may or may not plausibly infer, concerning the Jesus of history and his first-century world, without presupposing any kind of religious belief or unbelief. But don't be misled by the book's simplicity and clarity; it is based on wide-ranging knowledge of the field and on the finest and most cutting-edge scholarship.
-- Craig L. Blomberg, PhD, Professor, Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary

There is a huge need for intelligent scholarship to be effectively communicated beyond the academy, a role that Dickson fulfills brilliantly. Informed by scholarship, yet highly readable on a nontechnical level, this work is a very useful introduction to historical discussion about Jesus. The DVD is superb, communicating the best of scholarship in a way that ordinary viewers can appreciate. I cannot imagine an introductory New Testament or Gospels course where it would not be useful.
-- Craig Keener, Professor, Professor of New Testament, Palmer Seminary of Eastern University

Confusion about the historical Jesus is epidemic today. Here John Dickson clears the fog and explains with scholarly acumen and compelling arguments precisely how we know what we know about Jesus. In one stroke, he combines first rate scholarship with a clarity found among only the best teachers. This is the book I'll recommend to my students for years to come.
-- Gary M. Burge, Professor, Professor of New Testament, Wheaton College & Graduate School

Finally, an honest response to sensationalized stories about the life of Jesus. Dickson addresses with refreshing directness the real questions about Jesus' life and death and examines a sweeping collection of sources in providing full and fair answers. The accompanying video supplements and expands on the book in several important ways: by showing pictures of Rome, Jerusalem, and other important historical sites, by interviewing top-notch scholars, and by chatting with average people about real issues. This series should be part of every church's education curriculum.
-- Lynn Cohick, Associate Professor, New Testament, Wheaton College and Graduate School

There are many excellent books on the historical Jesus, but few written with the same clarity and balance as John Dickson's The Christ Files. While well-versed in the world of critical biblical scholarship, Dickson writes like a journalist, gently guiding readers through the maze of essential questions in the search for the real Jesus. Skeptic and believer alike will find Dickson's approach and cautious conclusions a breath of fresh air in a debate too often characterized by sensationalistic, headline-catching claims on the one side and fundamentalist naivety on the other.
-- Mark L. Strauss, Professor, New Testament, Bethel Seminary San Diego
