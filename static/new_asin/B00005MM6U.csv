1627649,5,B00005MM6U,"J.T is a bored, average, teen, spending the more times than not often slacking, working for his often brash and overworking dad's motel business. School is not much better for him as he and his friend, James, commonly find themselves victims of bullying at the hands of some smug, mealy-mouthed, redneck jabroni bullies. The only thing that seems to have given him any happiness in his life is meeting and instantly befriending a cute blonde girl by the name of Tonya--an aspiring model, who he finds lounging by the motel pool one afternoon.

Later that same afternoon, he rents a room to a mysterious woman who goes by the name Mrs. Smith who seems to have something up her sleeve. One night he storms up the ""brave"" idea with James to steal one of the motel occupant's convertible to go for a joyride in, in the hopes of impressing the blonde bombshell, Tonya. They're both reluctant at first but agree to anyway.

After stopping in a park, they're stunned to find the dead body of a local, abusive doctor in the trunk of the car. Purely out of reaction, J.T decides the best thing to do is to dump the body in the lake. Turns out the car belongs to the strange Mrs. Smith who in actuality is an assassin. When the 3 have a confrontation with Smith in the parking lot the next day, J.T fiercely refuses to cooperate, adding on the extremity of trouble they're already in. But it doesn't stop there as it turns out the police is also after them as well. Smith gives them until 5:30 that evening to return her car or she'll kill them all and their families. At a crossroads with the police and a merciless assassin on limited time, the 3 troubled teens must decide how to get themselves out of their predicament before everything comes full circle

Overall: While doing some searching one Sunday afternoon for a decent film to fill my afternoon, I found Joyride and is a find I don't regret. The first 10-15 minutes or so of this movie had me believing it was going to be a typical teen thriller/drama with typical stereotypes, but after about the first 15 minutes, the plot and characters change, making for a pleasing thriller. The only one of the 3 main characters that really doesn't have any character development is James. All we know about him is that he's a lonely, goody two shoes who drives a nice car. Really bland, not a whole lot going on, no background story, no build, and overall just a filler, two dimensional character who offered little to the basis of the film. And well enough, he was actually the only one in the entire film who gave a shoddy and unsatisfying performance. With a young Tobey Maguire's outstanding performance as J.T we see a lonely, outcast teen develop into a smart-mouthed, at times stupid wiseguy. The cute Amy Hathaway as Tonya starts off as being the stereotypical pretty face of the movie but as time goes on, we delve in and see that she's a pretty face struggling with some dark and emotional demons within and with her father. Christina Naify's role as the ruthless assassin, Smith was also admirable. While she, like the James character, lacks any background, her performance makes up for it and we see some character development with her towards the end. The plot of the film moves pretty quickly at an entertaining rate that's sure to keep you hooked until the final minutes that comes with a fine and clever twist. Overall, Joyride is a barely known, gripping story for a 90s teen thriller. Give this a watch not only for the story but for the great characters that helped put this story together",1447545600,,3549,4.577044025157233

1627672,4,B00005MM6U,"It is Toby Maguire that attracted me to this film for he has an almost dark comical portrayal of the characters he plays.  This is one of those films that mirrors the life and desires of teens coming of age, but in a strange way.  Maguire is the son of a motel owner into whose motel comes a femme fatale, who also happens to be a professional assassin.  The object of Maguire's undoing is not so much the attractive female staying at his father's motel, but her very swank black convertible.  A Friday night, a friend's old car broken down, and the attractive teenage daughter of a pimp all joining forces to take a joyride in the assassin's car launches them into a situation few would willingly go.  However, once out at a secluded spot by a lake, they stop to drink their beer and then search for more in the trunk of the stolen car.  No beer there, but their discovery certainly causes an abrupt turn in the plot of this movie.  Disposing of this object is not a solution but the catalyst for even more trouble as the story unfolds.  The assassin is bent upon having her car back no matter what it takes.  Figuring out who exactly stole the vehicle is quickly determined, and the team of teens are coerced into revealing its hidden location, amidst the investigation of a bungling police detective.  You will have to watch the movie for how this all ends.  I did not care much for the ending which wasn't a great disappointment, but could have been done better, considering how well-done the plot of the film is.",1417910400,,1517,4.4601449275362315

1627703,4,B00005MM6U,"Tobey Maguire (THE ICE STORM) stars as JT, a bored, disaffected teen working at a dumpy motel in a small, hick town.

Together, along w/ JT's friend, they steal a car and embark on a wild night of violence and mayhem. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the stolen car belongs to a female assassin who happens to be staying at the motel, and that her latest victim is in the trunk! JOYRIDE is an off-center thriller w/ an unusual storyline. I don't believe anything in the entire movie went in the direction I thought it would! I like that in a movie!

1627704,1,B00005MM6U,"I think it likely the only reason this film gets as many stars here as it did is that people must have confused it with other movies by the same basic title??  This is just bad directing, poor editing, and a rough script, poor make up effects and probably everything other than casting was sub standard is my guess.  The shame of it is that there was plenty of acting talent there for someone to work with, just no talent to make it work!  How did this line up of talent get sucked into this junk?",1381017600,2,497,4.15625

1627726,1,B00005MM6U,After reading many of the other reviews I opted to watch the movie. What a mistake! The acting was terrible as was the writing. The story line was weak but could have been do-able if the acting or the script had been decent. It was dead in the water. Don't waste your time.,1356825600,,273,4.169811320754717
1627727,5,B00005MM6U,"At first Joyride looked to be a small budget version of Natural Born Killers. Then Badlands, maybe. In the end, this movie made its own niche.

The entire cast was talented and delivered powerful performances. Even minor characters were 3-dimensional and then some (my favorite among these being the uniformed cop). In those instances where little action accompanied dialogue, the actors still made things interesting with comments, expressions, voice tones, etc.,. The screenwriter - Quinton Peeples - has both a sense of drama and humor.

Joyride managed to entertain with no help from exotic locales. Most scenes took place in relatively dreary settings like a run down motel parking lot, thus always needing something other than majestic mountains or 5-star restaurants to hold viewers' interest. Peeples as Director accomplished this in several ways, including giving several supporting characters enough face time to flesh out their roles and thereby add variety to his cinematic offering. What impressed me most, however, were the story's twists. I lost track of its surprising turns, often dramatic (and a couple stretching credulity, to be frank). Another technique was mystery: What exactly was happening in Tanya's room? Anticipation? You bet. Whenever Smith was in a scene... Let's just say she's a woman you do not want to upset. Ever.

Kudos to everyone involved!",1350086400,3,1377,5.336405529953917
1627728,2,B00005MM6U,"I had thought this was going to be the well-regarded Steve Zahn/Paul Walker JOYRIDE film. Alas, I decided to watch when I saw Tobey McGuire was going to be in this version.

Yeesh.

There is a lot of bad acting in this film. ""Smith"" is a joke. An over-the-top mess. McGuire begins as likable but loses all credibility after a discovery in the trunk of a stolen car. The ""gay"" character was really the only character whose actions made much sense from that point in the story forward.

I kept watching for some payoff. The only payoff that came was that this bizarre dud is over, and I now have the chance to spare someone from making the same mistake I did.

Skip it. You'd be better off watching weeds grow in your backyard or something.",1332028800,,738,4.404411764705882

1627731,3,B00005MM6U,"For anyone teaching a course to young actors, screenwriters, or directors, this pic is an excellent tool.  The problems inherent in the pic are just as instructive as its shining moments leaving a great deal of room to pick apart camera techinques, how the use of a musical score can detract from or add to a scene, and especially internalization of motive leading to choices an actor must make to infuse life into what otherwise could end up being a stereotypical, two-dimensional character.
Tobey Maguire has built a very respectable career on his sensitive, understated performances, yet the raw J.T. offers insight into Maguire's ability to branch out into personalities that are not always the ""hero.""  Though his relative inexperience does show through in places, the strong believability of his interpretation of J.T. clearly shows the raw talent evident in even his early work.
By far the most provoking performance in the pic is the underrated Amy Hathaway as the internally tortured and physically exploited Tanya.  A solid character interpretation from start to finish, Hathaway only stumbles when the script asks her for unnecessarily gratuitous lust, specifically the silly romp-in-the-car scene with Maguire.  On a contrasting note, during the powerful bedroom scene with the Mayor, Hathaway shines by deftly conveying a deep-seated anguish for Tanya's unfortunate situation that is craftily hidden during the remainder of her performance.
Also highly noteworthy is Benecio Del Toro.  It is common knowledge that small-budget productions can offer a wider scope of interpretation for an actor, and Del Toro demonstrates this to the fullest extent.  A master of subtle physical acting, this early role showcases the talent that blossomed in later years.  Along the same lines, Christina Naify as Ms. Smith does a nice job creating a real person out of a small amount of material by exploring physical gestures and vocal patterns that make up so much of a human being's personality.
All of the actors, and to a large extent the script itself, are nearly annihilated in many places by the exasperatingly poor musical score.  Instead of developing in the viewer a deeper understanding of the character's interactions, the score is often bad enough to be considered a true ""groaner.""
A must-see for Maguire, Hathaway, Del Toro, and those quirky Adam West fans, ""Joyride"" is more interesting as a study of technique than great storytelling, but well worth the ride.",1054080000,20,2473,5.211586901763225
1627732,5,B00005MM6U,"Produced in 1996, this film is enjoyable on many levels. Drama, comedy, thriller...
Tobey Maguire shows his star power. He seems to be having fun with the role of J.T. Likewise his co-stars Wilson Cruz and Amy Hathaway work well together as three friends trying to escape their various situations in life. Adam West and Steven Gilborn are cast against type to advantage and a nice cameo from James Karen also add to the enjoyment. Benicio Del Toro is hilarious as the deadly serious Detective Lopez and Kenn Norman is believable as the sheriff. Also noteworthy is Judson Mills as Redneck Joey. Lastly I have to say Christina Naify is a standout as 'Smith'. At once sexy and deadly, she plays her part exceptionally well. Thoroughly recommended. The DVD has no special features of note, with the exception of a filmography and biography of Tobey Maguire. The print is excellent and the sound crisp. Buy It!",1029196800,11,905,4.8076923076923075
