8636584,1,B00HW0OR7I,"Amazon video has the photo and description of the 2004 20min provocative short film by the same name.......  This is the 2010 low budget, no plot, bad acting film about a guy in a yellow car who keeps picking people up in his car on the way to Vegas.  Some very stupid things that make no sense will happen.  There is very little action.  Just a long string of random events.  Including stopping on a boat (on the way to Vegas! Yes in the desert) that's full of supposed porn stars and producers.  Despite that their is only implied sexual situations and no nudity.  This movie looks like a college project, not badly filmed but nothing to it. Don't waste your time.",1481328000,12,666,4.409836065573771
8636585,1,B00HW0OR7I,"First off this is the wrong photo on amazon. This is the photo of the 2004 (20 min) provocative short film.  This is the 2010 low budget flick about picking up hitchhikers and a ton of really stupid thing that happen on the road to Vegas.  Including running out of gas. Finding a dead body. Several boring fights.  And meeting porn stars and producers on a boat for no reason.  There is nothing at all to this movie.  Bad acting, no script, and a plot you could drive a fleet of trucks thru.",1481328000,,491,4.236559139784946
8636586,5,B00HW0OR7I,"A friend told me about this one and he was right. A road trip is more than the destination, with side trips into adventure, discovery, trouble and romance.  And not just one at a time!  It's a trip worth making.  Recommend it.",1425081600,,226,4.333333333333333
