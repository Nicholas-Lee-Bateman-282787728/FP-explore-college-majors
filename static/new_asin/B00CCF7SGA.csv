8580259,3,B00CCF7SGA,"The book is powerful and beautifully written.  Because it jumps around in time so much, the movie seems kind of disjointed and leaves a lot out.  I got bored with the movie.",1428710400,,173,4.375
8580260,2,B00CCF7SGA,"I gave this two stars mainly because it was just not an enjoyable experience watching so much low-life seediness, abuse. I have read the book so I knew what to expect. Nevertheless, there were several times during the film I wanted to just turn it off. It was just disturbing. The acting was fine. The movie followed somewhat the book, although there were a few deviations. I just didn't like it because it was so dark and disturbing.",1426809600,,434,4.576923076923077

8580264,5,B00CCF7SGA,"""Purge"" is one of the best foreign films that I have ever watched. Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting and a gripping plot are its three main features. This was Finland's submission to the Oscar last year, but it was not nominated. Why? I will never understand.

Purge is about two women, Zara, a teenager running away from her pimp, and Aliide, a middle aged woman with a past of unrequited love that drove her to make the most atrocious acts. Laura Birn, as the young Aliide, is one of the highlights of this films. Her character is totally despicable but I felt for her during the entire film. The historical backdrop of the Soviet occupation of Estonia gave me a peek into a part of history that is usually unknown, at least it for me.

""Purge"" was the best foreign film of 2012 in my opinion, and I even think that Laura Birn should have earned a nomination as a best actrees!",1373241600,3,888,4.509316770186335
