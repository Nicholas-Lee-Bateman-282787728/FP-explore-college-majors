8311103,1,B001ILHYAO,"Arrived loose in box all scratched up.  Sent it back for replacement.
Arrived in box not loose, but still scratched up again!!!!!!!!!!

Got so fed up I threw it out and could not watch this movie.  Really disgusted with seller and cheap product.
Do not buy.",1451001600,,257,4.543478260869565
8311104,5,B001ILHYAO,The most beautifully romantic look at life in 18th century rural life. Fournier only wrote one book before he was killed in the war. A tragedy. This is a must read book.,1443225600,,169,4.3125
8311105,4,B001ILHYAO,Much like a fairy tale - interesting camera techniques.,1407024000,,55,5.222222222222222
8311106,3,B001ILHYAO,"Lets be honest here- no film is ever likely to come close to the fantastic, some say life changing book.  This dvd was initially hard for me to track down but still glad I did as it adds some of its own into aura the mix although it does not capture the true essence - not for me anyway. I must admit though, even if this had a one star review I would still have bought it...",1402358400,,375,3.8701298701298703
8311107,5,B001ILHYAO,"A beautiful film and very true to the masterpiece by Alain-Fournier. This is a great love story but, unusually, written from a male perspective: a young man finds ""the ideal woman"", loses all trace of her, then finds her again after many adventures and misunderstandings. Brigitte Fossey is perfect in the role of Yvonne de Galais.

The scenes where the hero, Augustin Meaulnes, gets lost in the mist and stumbles upon the wedding festival at the lost domain perfectly recapture the magic and mystery of the novel.

Time to do a new release with subtitles to make this production available to a wider audience.",1358553600,3,610,4.855769230769231
8311108,4,B001ILHYAO,"Just needs subtitles, that's all. Otherwise it follows the book closely, although the actors seem a bit old for their roles.",1341532800,,124,4.9523809523809526
8311109,5,B001ILHYAO,"This is such a special and lovely film. Alain Fournier has been hailed as a French literary hero (sort of like Antoin d'Saint Exupery) and thought lost in battle in World War One. His remains were more or less recently found and appropriately laid to rest.
Would someone in France do the Americans the honor of urging the producers to create a dvd version WITH SUBTITLES so those of us who are deficient in their delightful language could enjoy this film and share it with new generations? Please tell someone like Juan Luis Bunuel (son of Luis)or some other sympathetic ear to agitate to create a version of this film so I can show it to all the people I need to have see it! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!",1307577600,12,698,4.4609375
8311110,2,B001ILHYAO,"This is such an impressive story with beautiful cinematography. I also saw this movie with subtitles many years ago and I have never forgot it.  I was so excited to receive the dvd as a Christmas gift, then soooo disappointed when there weren't any subtitles.",1298764800,7,259,4.7555555555555555
8311111,3,B001ILHYAO,"This is a film I have yearned to see again since I saw it in a cinema in the late 60's under the title ""The Wanderer"", so my dream has come true and for that I would give it six out of five!
BUT, the disappointment which kills it is why no subtitles? The cinema version had subtitles which I recall were of acceptable quality. You can usually turn them on or off on most DVD's so what's the problem?",1241395200,24,399,4.0
