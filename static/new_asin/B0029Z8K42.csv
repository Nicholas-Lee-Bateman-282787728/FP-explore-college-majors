3882723,1,B0029Z8K42,"This movie looked like it would fun. However, this movie has the most ridiculous plot I have ever seen. The premise for this movie and why Marcus is married to two women is ludicrous. The writers must think the viewer has no intelligence and that this can happen in real life. Without giving away the plot, there is no possible way that you would ask to turn off life support for a loved one and then just walk away. What about the paperwork required to turn off life support? What about a funeral? This movie didn't address these things and instead choose to jump two years after the accident. Absolutely ridiculous!!! That is why I turned this movie off after the first 30 minutes.",1254787200,7,683,4.516129032258065

3882753,1,B0029Z8K42,"ever have a moment when you see something horrible happening and you know you should look away, but you just can't?  that was my experience with this movie.

first things first:  when i saw that cherie johnson was in it, i knew i'd have to view it with an open mind.  this woman has never been a good actor.  i am not saying this to be mean.  it's just a fact.  but i decided that because quite a lot of time has passed since i last saw her in anything, i'd give her the benefit of the doubt.  perhaps she'd perfected her craft.  i was wrong.

although johnson is not the least of this movie's problems, she may be responsible for more of them than most of those involved; she is one of the writers and the writing sux out loud.  her low-class way of getting her man back at any cost, along with shar jackson's i'll-cut-yo-ass ghetto girl act made me flinch.  it didn't make sense to start out as a class act, but end Like That.

now, about the plot.  the just married vivian and marcus are in an accident as they leave their wedding.  he's fine, but she spends the next two years in a coma.  she wakes up from the coma, her husband is called and comes to get her.  his attitude about this was odd.  why would this man, who seems so in love with her at the beginning and the end, see her recovery and need for care as a burden?

as far as i can tell, vivian is never given an explanation of why marcus didn't come to see her the second year.  if she was told, she handled it in a very immature manner.  and, as someone else pointed out, how is it that the life support marcus could no longer afford is allowed to continue when he agrees to let it end?  according to him, the hospital claimed no paperwork was ever signed.  with maxed-out credit cards and no paperwork, who paid?  it's unlikely that a hospital would allow a year's free ride for that kind of care.  there's also room in here for a funeral.  as her husband, marcus would have been involved in that.  it's as if he just said, ""i can't pay.  go ahead and pull the plug,"" and that was the end of his involvement.  these points should have been acknowledged and addressed.

vivian's father, played by obba babatunde (i love that man!!!), died while she was hospitalized.  this fact only comes up when marcus is told that vivian has recovered from the coma and has nowhere to go.  it is never mentioned again, so there's no place for vivian to have a reaction to it.

and another thing:  how does one get up from a long-term comatose state needing nothing more than a wheelchair to exit the hospital?  shouldn't there have been some physical therapy?  vivian bounced out of that chair as if she'd just been in to get an infected hangnail treated.  after Two Years.  and why couldn't the same girl who looked after her for those two years find her some clothes to wear?  she left the hospital decked out in the jacked up wedding dress she was wearing when the accident happened.

then, there's the shoddy treatment of the pregnant new wife, jenny.  everyone participated in that shameful behavior.  this doesn't make much sense when it was she who suggested that they take vivian in.  because she comes across as goodhearted and generous but naive, the treatment seemed especially unwarranted.  the name-calling directed at her didn't help.  worse, almost all of it was about race.

this movie is a tacky, tasteless farce and a waste of time and money.

i can't help wondering if babatunde, an excellent actor, was relieved to have such a brief role in this train wreck of a flick.",1379030400,3,3540,4.375384615384616

3882759,1,B0029Z8K42,"Well, it sounded like fun, when I read the summary. However, the lines are cheap and naive and the actors' play is so-so. Like some other ppl said, the script is jumpy and kinda unrealistic. However, I liked the fact that the end was real. If something else happened, it would have been made-believe. I don't know, maybe Marcus wanted to try how it is with the white girl, but deep in his heart was still bonded to his first wife. Which is kinda controversial, because if he really loved her, he wouldn't have just forgot about her. Anyways... good idea, but bad execution.",1332892800,,573,4.519230769230769

3882763,2,B0029Z8K42,"This movie was poorly developed. It had some funny moments, yet it was choppy in several places. I could point out some very intricate details, such as the day she got out of the hospital, nobody thought to bring her some clean clothes, instead she went home in the bloody wedding gown....REALLY? Then, the whole jumping to 2 years later, pulling the switch with no paperwork, and no funeral...it was poorly edited. It was just something on tv, like most BET movies! I normally don't watch black cinema,but this one just happened to be on. I didn't like how it dipicted a woman fresh out of acoma trying to kill a pregnant woman and her baby....(not cute at all!)
Marcus was a treat for the eyes to see....and Candi made me laugh a few times! However the ending left me confused....I still had questions as to what happened!
So...can anybody reading this tell me what happened at the end?
The soundtrack was HOTT....that was probably the best part of the movie, the music! Amazon should sell the soundtrack instead of the movie!",1317081600,,1028,4.653846153846154

3882765,3,B0029Z8K42,"This is a film that you should rent before you buy it. Some of the logic of this film is just wrong, but I actually enjoyed the film. The whole idea is pliable, but not realistic because of legal issues which aren't addressed at all. The script needed some work on it, but Cheri Johnson does make a good attempt to carry this film, but even she struggles to do it at times.
If you are into modern day ""Black Cinema"", it is worth seeing at least once, but rent it to make sure that you really want to buy it and add it to your collection.",1307836800,,537,4.02803738317757
3882766,4,B0029Z8K42,"Good quality, shipped before time and was like new as stated. I saw this movie on BET and I knew I needed it for my home movie library.  Not Oscar worthy acting, but very original plot and entertaining.",1307491200,,202,4.315789473684211
3882767,1,B0029Z8K42,"I caught this movie on Centric channel and was drawn in by the initial scenes of coma wife in the hospital. I wondered where the story was going. But it quickly went downhill from there. If you like stereotypes such as ""loud, angry, violent"" black woman, ""docile, airheaded, neurotic"" white woman, and ""no good"" black man, then you may find this amusing. I didn't. I cringed. It wasn't even a clever satirical portrayal of stereotypes- it was just straight up ignorant and unfunny. Oh yeah, throw in a little violence against a pregnant woman and attempted murder of an unborn child. Coma wife insisted that pregnant wife do vigorous exercise while late in her pregnancy, drink energy drinks (that were presumably caffeinated), and ""spiked"" pregnant wife's salad with a bunch of salt to make her blood pressure rise. The movie didn't make it seem as if coma wife's agenda was to cause pregnant wife to lose the baby, but if she wasn't trying to make her lose the baby, then WHY was she shown doing all that stuff? It was for a reason, and it left me once again, cringing. The character relationships were inconsistent- one minute pregnant wife is jealous and insecure about coma wife, next minute pregnant wife is confiding in coma wife and trying to be her friend, then next minute pregnant wife is suspicious of coma wife calling her a b---h, then pregnant wife invited coma wife to a fancy event as her date...what the heck?! On numerous occasions Char Jackson's character is shown being ""restrained"" from ""beating"" pregnant wife...again, what the heck? Also, coma wife is restrained from beating pregnant wife and threatens that if she is not removed from the house, there will be ""slow singing and flower bringing"". All the gratuitous violence in a supposed romcom movie was absurd! It's not worth waiting for the ending. Ugh!",1299628800,9,1831,4.834394904458598
3882768,1,B0029Z8K42,"This movie started off with a lot of potential. Vivian and Marcus were both very well off, educated people who really seemed to love each other. Then Viv's in a coma and two years later, she's a conniving, evil little bitch who sabotages a pregnant woman's life as well as her child's for the sake of 'true love'.

What is this? What kind of movie is this? What kind of message are you sending along here to black women? Especially that Marcus' pregnant wife is white and Vivian and her friend constantly talk about 'white bitches', 'white slut', 'rich white Daddy's girl', come on! There was a stellar cast and a plot with a great starting point and it went this way? Please.

BET, please, raise the standards. There have been some fantastic BET movies with amazing messages and you had to pull this up next? Just stop it.

Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie unless you want to be disgusted in some of the things that the human race can come up with.",1298678400,6,963,4.429378531073446

April plays a dumb ""white girl"" yet has smart moments where she catches on to what the first wife was doing. The argument in the kitchen could have been better from Aprils side. After all the woman tried to kill her baby!

Ending was terrible. Bottomline is a happy marriage and a family is split up because of the selfishness of the first (and seemingly dead) wife. Ugh",1291075200,3,505,4.372340425531915

The black women were portrayed as loud, manipulative, and vindictive while the white woman was portrayed as meek, too understanding, and easy to control. This movie was predictable and undeveloped.

You NEVER stop Loving him/her or for that matter being in Love with that Special Someone.  But sad to say you must go on with your life as he did.  But in the end TRUE LOVE prevailed.

Women disrespecting each other isn't funny.  Nothing entertaining or spiritual about people hurting each other.  The movie suddenly ends with a lame speech about what God intended.  If the characters had God in their hearts all along they could not have treated each other as they did.  The writers had no intelligent conclusion or purpose to this film.  The lack of character development was stunning.  No one grew up or learned anything from their experiences.  This was immature storytelling.,1517788800,,673,5.214953271028038

O.K. then your surprised your 1st and legal wife was never taken off life support and came out of acoma.  You loved her so much and you maxed out your credit cards yet who do you think would have paid for her funeral.  So much more that makes no sense what so ever.  However it was so rediculous i had to watch it.  LOl,1517443200,,490,3.938775510204082
8358728,1,B0029Z8K42,"Terrible movie! One of the worst I've ever seen. Basically black and white woman are both married to the same Man.. Husband thought first wife (black woman) died due to car accident and moved on. He remarried a white Woman and throughout movie she is pregnant... When the first wife wakes up from coma she does everything in her power to break up a happy home and get husband back after white Woman let her live in their home.... Well, Man ends up going back to first wife who does lots of mean things throughout the movie.. I'm neither black nor white but as a Woman I found the movie poorly written and felt disrespected as a Woman. Didn't like the movie and wouldn't recommend it.",1512777600,,683,4.428571428571429
