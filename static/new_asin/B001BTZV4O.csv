8284899,1,B001BTZV4O,"As a World War II buff and fan of German Armor, I was really looking forward to viewing this DVD.

What a disappointment. Granted, some of the historical footage is decent enough, but that's about it. Descriptions of the tanks (especially the Russian T34) are either incomplete or incorrect. For example, no distinction is made between the original T34 (with the 76mm main gun) and the upgunned version (T34/85) with its larger turret.

Worst of all, the DVD does not bring Operation Barbarossa to its conclusion. It ends at the first German retreat without so much as an explanation of what happened after that. Did the Germans win? Did the Russians? Of course we all know how things turned out, but you would never know that from this movie.

Save your money.",1381449600,8,761,4.75
