Love that it's in French, I need the practice.
While this is not an enthralling documentary, it has value in an art reference collection",1367193600,,221,4.162790697674419
2584402,5,B000FTCF3Q,Sent it to a friend after watching it.  She didn't know about the chapel but loves Matisse.  It was a huge hit and she's shown it to others.,1358812800,,140,3.9642857142857144
2584403,5,B000FTCF3Q,This documentary of the woman (nun) who inspired Matisse to create the Vence chapel is remarkable for its simplicity.  The interviews with Sister J-M and the photos and film of Matisse at work are unforgetable. This platonic love affair gave birth to a child in the form of the chapel.  Kudos to Barbara Freed.,1223683200,,310,4.722222222222222
2584404,5,B000FTCF3Q,"This is a modest little film about a humble and down-to-earth woman, Sister Jacques-Marie, who became a nun early during her acquaintance with Matisse.  Originally hired to be his night nurse, she remained his close and loyal friend until his death.  Their friendship was the catalyst for the chapel at Vence, which for its time was revolutionary in its modernity and unconventionality.  Conducted mostly in interview style, the film remains visually exciting by dwelling lingeringly on Matisse's lovely drawings and the many wonderful details of the chapel.  Although Matisse was not overtly religious, the chapel demonstrates the extremes of his devotion; begun when he was in frail health at the age of 75, for him it was a deeply spiritual and utterly consuming passion to which he devoted his remaining years.  He left no detail unconsidered, even designing the colorful vestments to be worn during mass.  Matisse suffered considerable criticism over the chapel, Sister Jacques-Marie was oppressed for years by her superiors in the convent, and they were both pilloried by the press.  Yet in the end they derived enormous satisfaction both from the chapel and from their friendship.  A delightful and inspirational exploration of a fascinating friendship.",1220227200,22,1260,5.328282828282828
2584405,5,B000FTCF3Q,"For anyone interested in the ""Maitre's"" huge project of the chapel in Vence,
this DVD is a MUST-HAVE.
Soeur Jacques-Marie is interviewed.. She gives a lively, personal account of her envolvement with the project
and with Matisse. She was truly a muse. I give this charming interview 5 stars.",1203292800,,291,4.959183673469388
2584406,3,B000FTCF3Q,"This documentary is quite full summed up in the title.  Although written, remembered and told from the perspective of Sister Jacques-Marie, the subject is of course the creation of the wonderful Chapel of Vence by Matisse.

The burgeoning friendship that grew between the nun and Matisse is interesting, if not quite fascinating, and told in a very understated way by the Sister herself.  Most of the film is therefore in French, with subtitles.  However, the interest really picks up when she talks about his art, and most especially the creation of the chapel itself.  Matisse saw through every aspect of its creation, and it is fascinating to learn of his intended effect with the details which Sister Jacques-Marie mentions.  The anemone flowers inspiring the shape of the candlesticks, designing even the priests vestments, the prickly-pear flower motif on the stained glass window - and most especially the light.

Matisse was all about the colour and light - the lines and shapes were often simple - but the combined effect of the light and colours is inspired.  There is a moment when through a stained glass window in only three colours, a myriad of colours is shown in an ever changing pattern on the floor of the chapel.  It makes the whole documentary worth watching to see this glorious effect.

This movie is shot in a very simple talking heads style, and gains no plaudits for inventive film-making or incisive interviewing, but is worth watching as a highly interesting account of an intimate story and the mind behind the artist.",1180137600,5,1546,4.934362934362935
2584407,3,B000FTCF3Q,"The title suggests that Matisse's friend  (Sister Jacques Marie)
was an important model as well as the inspiration for
the chapel in Vence, France.  Both are overstatements.  Yes, while she was a nurse for Matisse, he did some drawings and paintings of her but she was not his significant model.  Nor was she the ""inspiration"" for the Chapel but was instead his good companion and liason for the project.

Personally, I did not find Sister Jacques Marie to be a particularly interesting woman.  She is a solid French individual, honest, the salt of the earth, and absolutely unpretentious. But she does not seem the sort to inspire Matisse either creatively or romantically.

The star of the film is Matisse himself...and of course, the chapel itself.  It is a marvelous thing.  I did not realize that he was involved in almost every aspect of the project, from the
floor, the walls, the stained glass windows, the drawings of the
stations of the cross, the sculpture.  What was his inspiration?  His understanding of God as a source of life and joy...and beauty.  Even the vestments, yes the priest vestments are the art of Matisse.  Wonderful.

Certain facts were quite intriguing.  At times, Matisse had to paint the walls of the chapel with a 9 foot brush which was quite a task for a man over 70 years.  The original impression of the community was not favorable; the common folk were used to conservative churches.  Perhaps the saddest fact of this documentary was that at Matisse's death, the Church would not allow Sister Jackques Marie to honor her friend by attending the funeral.  That, in my view, is inexcusable.

I would recommend renting the film rather than purchasing it.  The subtitles were somehwat hard to read and the pace is quite slow.  What makes the movie significant are the scenes in which the chapel is being built and the sensation of delight once this lovely tribute to God was complete.",1158019200,9,1917,4.801223241590214
2584418,5,B000FTCF3Q,"This documentary is about a chapel Matisse built in the town of Vence in the south of France and the young woman who inspired him to build the chapel. The film provides insight in to his art generally but more so regarding his chapel.  He designed the building, wiindows, art, altar, candelabras, even the vestments the priest wears at Mass. I'd love to visit this chapel. The documentary was really enjoyable and uplifting.",1487721600,2,424,4.808219178082192

2584420,5,B000FTCF3Q,"Do Not Miss This!  A fascinating inside glimpse of one of our world's beloved modern artists.

I could kick myself for not knowing about this chapel, a symbol of his affection for his companion, when I visited the south of France in my youth.  What a glorious testament to art and friendship.  The people of Vence who worship there must feel quite a sense of energy from the art and their faiths.  It strikes me as odd that more celebrated modern art is not reflected in newer places of worship.  Art and faith have always been great partners.

The documentary was very informative, touching and uplifting.  I did start weeping at the end, I must admit, more out of appreciation for this beautiful friendship that unfolded before my eyes.  Very special movie.  I am a great admirer of Matisse's work, especially during his southern French period.  Brings me joy and awakens my spirit.",1487116800,8,884,4.712418300653595

The two personalities of Sister Jacques-Marie, and Matisse himself, came out very clearly and congenially, and the nun, in her later years, speaking in a very plain and direct French without embellishment but with good sub-titles, was a particular pleasure.  The story of the chapel in the South of France that these two improbably linked people built together, against a good deal of opposition, and the images of the chapel with its fittings and vestments done by Matisse, were all delights to be savored.",1485129600,,638,4.844036697247707

She, now in her nun's habit,  fills the frame with her wonderfully expressive face and twinkling eyes, as she tells of the intense, playful, platonic, mutually gratifying relationship they shared, and the resultant masterwork that it spawned. The trajectory of her life also maps his evolution in his later years; at first contemptuous of her joining a convent, he later taps into his own spirituality. She nursed him, then modeled for him, then chose her religious calling , all the while exchanging light-hearted teasing and deeply personal views with him. Both were artists. Matisse's great affection for her and influence by her led to the birth of a chapel that showcases all the elements of his art in a religious forum; maybe an unusual departure for him then, but in the end, an obvious and very natural choice and glorious finished product. His struggles in attempting to balance and gratify the religious, artistic, and political communities in the execution of this project are formidable .

It is a unique tale of a woman who met Matisse when she was young and single, and willing to even pose for him as well as share snippets of his life. With time they developed a special bond, and there is even the suggestion that Matisse may have been in love with her - but she chose the life of a nun, which seemed to almost break his heart. He must have overcome this though, because eventually the two of them worked on a unique project together, the building of a chapel. The story itself is so original that it is worth hearing, and the film is not too long to absorb all that it has to tell. The art and architecture, however, is arguably a tragedy of its own kind.

Despite their philosophical arguments over religion, his respect and love for her inspired Matisse to create, design, and construct the chapel in Vence, France.  I learned a lot of things about Matisse that I hadn't known before - like the fact that he didn't have stomach muscles after his cancer surgery, so he could not stand for too long at a time. Yet he painted many of the murals in the chapel standing up, using a 9-foot pole with a rag attached at the end -- requiring tremendous strength and effort on his part. Sister Jacques-Marie in the movie is delightful -- honest, mischievous, direct, and candid. The joyful, open spirit of the film's subjects -- Matisse and the Sister -- come through clearly, elevating the low-tech/bad production filmmaking through the sheer power of a wonderful story.",1412640000,9,896,5.0134228187919465

She was in her early 20's and had completed one year of nursing school.  She and Matisse became fast friends as she likes to paint and draw, too, as a hobby.  He asked her to model for him which surprised her as her parents had always told her she was ugly.  Later when she decided to become a nun, Matisse wrote her a long letter trying to talk her out of it.  In this film you gain insight as to what Matisse was like: joyful, kind, curious and playful.  This is like an interview with the nun who happily recalls her years with Matisse and describes the chapel they worked on together.  The nun speaks in French but there are subtitles.

I can see why he liked having her around. Her youth and naivete gave him a fresh perspective on things. She was not someone who simply told him everything he did was wonderful. She was genuine.

8126332,5,B000FTCF3Q,"I had no idea that Matisse was such a versatile artist. I had never heard of the chapel at Vence Yes, I knew of his drawings and paintings, not that I see much difference. Yes, his drawings adorn the walls, made permanent in glazed tile. Yes, he composed the stained glass. Yes, his famed cutouts still adorn the celebrants' vestments. And yes, he put four years of hist life into this chapel (now on my bucket list).

But no, I never heard of it before, (not that I claim much knowledge of Matisse). And no, I never heard how he connected to this project initially. And no, I never heard of this life-long affection for this young woman.

But that's just background. This isn't directly about Matisse, it's sort of a carom shot. Really, it's a long interview with sister Jacques-Marie. Matisse first engaged her as a nurse, to help his recovery from major surgery. They bond, and that bond lasts for a lifetime- his, because hers went longer.

Half a century after the chapel completed, decades after Matisse's death, this interviews sister Marie Jacques. It has to be the most chaste love story ever - the love is there, real, enduring, chaste, but hugely fecund. See this for sister Jacques Marie, but watch it for the rich detail.

8126334,5,B000FTCF3Q,"Magnificent story. Friendship, love, art, innovation, and bravery. The artist and the nun - two people from different walks of life, following different paths - had their lives converge at several times. I was struck by how she helped him recover from difficult surgery, and how he built a chapel for her order.
This movie challenged my thoughts on their relationship in several ways. Normally one does not think of a nun as knowing much about love, or art. Likewise one does not think of an artist who was once labeled a Fauve (wild beast) artist as someone who knows much about religion or spirituality. Yet they spoke often of all of these things, and it became clear that both people had unique and compelling views that were worth hearing. I want to watch the movie again and hear them at least one more time.
I was most impressed by the humility of the nun, Sister Jacques-Marie, who would not claim credit for being anything more then a link in the chain of the building of the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence. It is very plain that she was the inspiration for it.
Sister Jacques-Marie tells her story with a merry face and a wry tone. Her candor and recollection is astonishing. This film is a treasure. Thank you Amazon for hosting it, and thank you to everyone involved in the making of A Model For Matisse.",1487980800,7,1314,4.548523206751055
