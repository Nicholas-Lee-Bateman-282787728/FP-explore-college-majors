7005851,5,B00TEYPVSE,"A fun, semi-serious British spoof of the James Bond genre.  David Niven is at his suave, imperturbable best, while Franoise Dorleac is a delight.  Sadly, Ms. Dorleac, the elder sister of Catherine Deneuve, died at the age of 25 in an automobile accident, and so only appeared in  handful of movies.
  The basic plot is that a British agent in Beirut was compromised and killed by the Soviets.  The British, not having heard from the agent, are concerned, and so decide to send someone to try to find out where the agent, K, is.  Unfortunately, MI-6 had no top-line agents available and so had to recruit someone for the job.  They turned to Dr. Love for the job, and thus begins the adventure.
  Some may find the plots turns predictable, but the fun lies in how the film gets to and navigates those turns.
  Well worth watching.",1432512000,9,829,4.5646258503401365
7005852,5,B00TEYPVSE,"If you're a fan of the rash of spy movies prevalent in the 1960s, riding on the popularity wave made by the 007 films,  you're probably aware that this is definitely one of the better ones. Balancing equal measures of humor and suspense, WTSA is based on a book, PASSPORT TO OBLIVION, one of a series of novels by James Leasor, about a Dr. Jason Love, who is indoctrinated into the service of British intelligence.  Directed by Hammer Films' alumni, Val Guest , and with an intriguing score by Mario Nascimbene, WTSA follows the amateur spook, Dr. Love,  perfectly played by David Niven, as he travels from one exotic location to the next to fulfill his mission. Like any good spy story, characters spring up right and left with questionable loyalties to either Her Majesty's Government, or to the Soviet Union. I remember seeing this as a kid and liking it, and have been totally satisfied with finally being able to obtain a copy of it, and enjoying it even more than the first time around. If you're a spy movie aficionado,  or just enjoy a very well constructed thriller, then this is a must!",1431216000,18,1096,4.605128205128205

7005855,5,B00TEYPVSE,"I remember watching this movie years ago and was excited to finally see the DVD available after all these years. I'm a big David Niven fan and I really enjoy this spy spoof, fun movie. Niven plays a doctor who is recruited by the British Secret Service to go on a mission. He doesn't really take all the spydom stuff too seriously, and he keeps getting into and out of situations and close calls using his smarts. There's no bumbling into and out of situations.

If you are into spy thrillers and like Mr. Niven, I recommend this movie to you.",1453593600,2,543,4.376237623762377
7005856,4,B00TEYPVSE,Not a comedy.  Good spy movie from the 60's.  Good color and shot on location.  Niven is great.,1450396800,,95,4.166666666666667
7005857,2,B00TEYPVSE,"After reading several reviews here, I decided to add this one to my extensive 60's Spy Film collection. I love David Niven, so how could I go wrong?
O, let me count the ways, brethren, 'cause this one's a drag from start to finish.

First, you expect me to believe that British Intelligence didn't have enough agents to go around (at the height of the Cold War?), so they had to recruit a surgeon (Niven) named Dr. Love. How? By promising to appease his car fetish + provide him with some extravagant vehicle which, by the way, never materializes.

Secondly, there is no real villain in this film, so it gets rightfully dinged for that disgrace. How can you have a Cold War spy film w/o a tangible villain wringing sweaty palms while plotting a world takeover?

Thirdly, and let me remind you we're talking about a spy flick here, there is only ONE woman in the film, and she's nothing to look at (and I don't care who's sister she was or that she died in a car accident shortly after this film; which would have been a better plot than what we're succumbing to here). Again, ONE woman - no leggy, mini-skirted, scantily clad vixens or dollies to ease the pain or divert one's attention to prurient fantasies like all other spy flicks. Harsh? Sure, but it's my review - be as kind + forgiving as you want when you write your own...

Weapons? The obligatory spy pen, cyanide pill, a silly ring and a watch used to identify agents, given to by an uncle - had the Brits never seen Man From U.N.C.L.E??? One cheesy cheap clich after another.

Locales? The ass-end of Beirut, full of squalor and no evil henchmen residing.  Not even a high-end hotel, no exotic scenery, major landmarks, nada. Yeesch.

 And apparently, British Intelligence was completely inept as far as field agents go, which makes me wonder how we won the Cold War, 'cause this common, middle-aged Dr. Love (sounds like a 70's exploitation character) manages to violently kill a slew of people (isn't that a violation of the Hippocratic Oath?), out-maneuver the Reds and save the world in what other reviewers have stated as 'realistic' for a spy flick... huh?

It's about 20 minutes too long, seeing as we know how this is going to play out about 30 minutes in. My tolerance for the tedious when it comes to 60's cinema is remarkably high, but this clunker was a drag throughout. I should have seen it coming when I saw how many times Val Guest's name was splashed during the opening credits - he's a hack along the lines of Harry Novak, only less subtle (lol).
The only two things this film has in its favor are David Niven and a great soundtrack featuring B-3 organ legend Jimmy Smith and some frantic percussion to simulate action sequences that really aren't there..

In conclusion, I'm sure I've ticked off a boatload of folks, but I've sunk many a ship before this. I'm just trying to warn other like-minded fools not to fall for all the hype I did when I plopped down coin for this cinematic swill.
'Where the Spies Aren't' would've been a more appropriate title.",1446076800,8,3035,4.552293577981652
7005858,5,B00TEYPVSE,"Excellent fun diversion movie after success of Pink Panther , David Niven was a genuine guy who served in combat with the British Army Rifle Brigade during WWII .  His genuineness always adds to his roles , in my opinion .",1445385600,,222,4.414634146341464

7005861,5,B00TEYPVSE,"OK, I'm a Niven junkie, so almost anything with him in it is going to get 5 stars from me!  However, I did enjoy this movie.  Not up to Separate Tables or Guns of Naveronne standards, but still fun to watch.",1438819200,,207,4.024390243902439
7005862,4,B00TEYPVSE,"(Note: I would definitely give this a 4 1/2 stars if possible)
With a jaunty title like that, I expected more light hearted fare, but Matt Helm this ain't. This is a top of the line spy flick in a era littered with cheap, assemblyline 007 knockoffs. This is light years away from Niven's spy spoof, Casino Royale. Niven is like Cary Grant's North by Northwest everyman in extraordinary circumstances. At first he is confused in his role, but then when he, like the viewer, realizes this is a life and death matter, he rises to the occasion. Niven can be tough and his character dishes it out and then endures some real brutal treatment. I found it refreshing that this Cold War piece had no hesitancy as showing the Soviets as real bad guys. Even the Bond movies never dared that without a caveat. A little extra is Jason Love's appreciation for classic cars and how he uses that to track down the opposition. Rather a pity that Mr. Niven didn't reprise the role, but for a one-shot its a very satisfying vintage film.",1437868800,2,1018,4.508108108108108
