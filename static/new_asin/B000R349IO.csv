2858164,4,B000R349IO,"I just finished watching Lilies last night. It was very good and was very enjoyable. I wanted to give it 5 stars but had to give 4 because of the accents of the actors, I have to admit I had a hard time understanding some of the dialog, by the time it was over I was a little better at figuring out what was being said. I hope there is a second season just so dadda can get back  with Miss Bird and tell his bratty children to grow up! I thought the acting was really wonderful, especially the actors who played Ruby and Billy. Anyway, if you love period pieces then ""Lilies"" is a MUST!!",1200009600,12,587,4.060344827586207
2858165,5,B000R349IO,"Unfortunately, only 1 season of Lilies was made, but what a season it was.  I loved this series and would  highly recommend this to any lover of period drama.  I couldn't wait to get home and watch more...and I even took the time to write this review...",1196553600,15,253,4.340425531914893
2858166,5,B000R349IO,"Having seen Lilies first on Amazon UK, I got it as soon as the American version came out, and I am so glad that I did!

Lilies is a wonderful BBC period drama about three working class sisters (Iris, May, and Ruby Moss) as they adjust to life after WWI in Liverpool, England. The oldest daughter, Iris takes over the role of the sisters' late mother, cleaning while cooking for both the family and a local bakery; May works as a maid for a rich household, but dreams of being a movie star; while Ruby spends her days selling corsets.

Lilies doesn't let viewers down in its entertainment value: The script is packed with secrets, family and class conflict, forbidden love, attempted suicide, hidden desires, and much more, all taking place at a time when society was beginning to move into a new mode that was both more free and liberal. Not to mention the acting is first-rate and the characters and storylines are extremely well-developed.

Don't waste a moment before you go out and get this series. It is addictive, and you will not be disppointed!",1192665600,96,1052,4.614973262032086
2858167,5,B000R349IO,"I like this tv series, although it ends after this one season and I would have liked to see them develop the characters lives into another season.",1485388800,2,146,4.444444444444445
2858168,5,B000R349IO,"That I ever gave a series five stars before or wrote using a superlative, I now regret. All should have been reserved for this series. I've seen well-acted, exceptionally-written, beautifully filmed, series before, but none so perfectly compelling as this. I LOVED the characters, they move you and then dwell in you; their faces each magnificently capturing a profound depth of emotion, further expressed in the words of a brilliant script. Better than that, if possible, the Series is lightened with the humor born uniquely in the Irish (when they hide the children during the Tally or when Dadda swears at the pig) and is shines with depictions of  fervent dignity, wicked independence,the triumphs rising from of loyalty to family, country and God.
For any American with Irish grandparents -- this series could be played on a cd and listened to like music: the Irish lilt heard in Lilies  is so melodic its reach exceeds that of music.
But even as I read this review, for all it's heralding of this Series it fails. I cant write with the flourish,  emote  with poignancy, reflect love, anger, hope, disappointment, fear, bravery, independence in all the nuanced and profound ways this painfully short Series does. You will have to watch it.
Irish Americans watching this for the first time on Netflix will NO DOUBT be broken hearted to learn (as I am right now) that Lilies was made with only one season.",1484784000,,1408,4.854166666666667
2858169,5,B000R349IO,Unfortunate it ran for only one season!  It was wonderful!,1483401600,,58,4.8
2858170,5,B000R349IO,"Excellent British series.  Good plot, well acted and directed.",1482105600,,62,5.888888888888889
2858171,5,B000R349IO,"I surprised myself , using the term gorgeous to describe this story set in struggling, impoverished 1920s Liverpool just after WWI, but It's the whole production I refer to. The ""lilies"" is what Dadda Moss (Brian McCardie) calls his 3 maturing daughters, when he isn't alternately crushing their blooms. Deftly written by Heidi Thomas, in 8 episodes, this fast-moving, action-packed run of the emotional gamut, tells the story of  the Moss family's triumphs and tragedies. Iris ( Catherine Tyldesley) cares for her Dad ,sisters and brother Billy ( Daniel Rigby), who has returned from war emotionally impaired. The mother has died recently. Iris's gaze is mostly towards heaven and across to Father Melia (Scott Williams) for guidance. Whether they know  it or not,  there is an underlying amorous vein, bordering on sexual tension, at least in the viewer. May (Leanne Rowe), the first to admit she suffers no bouts of conscience,  is a parlor maid for an affluent couple, and falls victim to a pre-planned seduction. The feisty Ruby (Kerrie Hayes) is the most ambitious as she competes for the Olympic swim team, straps women into grueling corsets, and attempts to win favor with an elitist, disdaining element of society. So many social aspects are explored, but without a sledge hammer, but every bit as potent due to excellence in writing, directing, acting. All disciplines unite expertly: photography, music, all. And it seems that we, as the audience, are guided so exquisitely through all the vicissitudes of this family's life that we become more resilient to the sometimes extreme shifts between the comic and tragic.  Really impressive is the writer and directors' ability to keep the drama authentic and credible, with only a brief lapse into the melodramatic in the last episode. The two actors playing the priest and the father are brilliant. I so regret this series never had a sequel.  Extraordinary, highly recommend!",1480118400,,1934,5.123809523809523
2858172,4,B000R349IO,"Excellent acting & story telling. Filmed strongly. All the characters were fascinating. This series dealt with the lives of family members in lower class Liverpool just after the end of WWII & onwards. The father is Scottish (thus his wild accent). My husband's mother is from lower middle class England & we've traveled all over the UK so the accents weren't a problem for us. But I can see why some people are frustrated by the accents.
I did Hate the violence toward animals. But the killings were ""off stage"". However, the sound effects were awful. So I did Not like that.
But I did love the characters & was interested in all that they experienced. There was the suffrage movement, an immigrant from Germany, men with PTSD & horrible injuries from war, love, out of wedlock pregnancy, a gay affair (Huge moral ""no-nos"" at the time), sisters arguing but helping each other. All of them trying to find ways to make money to help support the family. There is an estrangement but this resolves at the end.
SPOILERs

There is a horrible & long scene of the father beating Violently the pregnant daughter & her sisters (who covered her to protect her). If you (as I have) ever experienced violent beatings by a parent, this is a really bad scene to endure.

It was awful how the sisters & their brother forced the lonely, widowered father to give up his romance. That was absurd. That was Not ""of the times"" because many men lost wives to chidlbirth sepsis & other health issues in those days & many re-married. But that was the writers' choice. I just did not like it & felt less happy with the sisters & their brother for this selfish behavior.

I was hoping this would be an uplifting series about family & faith. It didn't bother me that the ""Orange"" (Protestant) father was so outspoken about his anti-Catholic stance. That fit his character. But toward the end, there was too much negativity about Catholics & faith. There was a group of atheists (who are into eugenics, as the Nazis later were--to sterilize poor & ""feeble"" women) who influence one of the sisters (Ruby). She is so strong minded, though, that she escapes their clutches.
But there was too much sadness with the priest, children separated by a mean nun at an orphanage & other negative side lines.
Again, I did really like this series 90% Just not the animal cruelty or the anti-Catholic stuff. Or the beatings or father being deprived of love.",1479081600,2,2416,4.640186915887851
2858173,5,B000R349IO,"Once I attuned myself to the British accent, I was captivated by the story, by the social class differences and clashes and, of course, by some outstanding acting and direction. Charming, with a bite of reality. GK",1478649600,2,214,4.8108108108108105

It was rather difficult to root for anybody. I was also appalled by how many atrocities were committed on innocent animals in this series. This detracted from my focus quite a bit, as I felt that they were totally unnecessary to further the story plot.

The show/script/actors/writing&dialogue flowed oh-so-very-naturally,totally,AND easily..accents of most of the players were/are definitely NORTHERN England, w/a few Liverpudlian expressions neatly tossed in..!And Brian McArdies' ""northern Irish"" accent was done quite well in fact...My only regret, personally, was that there were no more episodes/series ...it was a most genuine/refreshing sequence of adventures of the Moss,and associated 'families'.....Would kill to find either more of THIS Series someday, or one reMARKably like it!!!Bazillion Stars,Bravo!!!",1471651200,2,749,6.731958762886598

Acorn TV brought me the British program Lilies. The only thing disappointing about this show is that there is only the one series. I couldn't believe the BBC could let this program slip by without renewal. I gather it received low ratings due to bad program scheduling. How many times have we seen that in the US? Hopefully, as has happened here, some TV exec from another UK company will have the good sense to grab this program and run with it! Shows like this don't grow on trees, you know!

An amazing tale of the resiliency of the Irish diaspora who found  themselves in an English city after WW I, but were soon immersed in the Protestant/Catholic tensions that exist today. The story involves a family living amid stark poverty with a widower father and daily turmoil. The actor portraying the father is worth the price of admission alone. Three daughters, one living son, and one son lost on the WW ! battlefields.

2858261,5,B000R349IO,"This wonderful series from 2007 tells the story of a working class family in Liverpool post World War I.  The lilies of the title are the three sisters of the Moss family.  Watching the sisters interact and learning of their hopes and dreams the viewer also learns how much their world is changing in the aftermath of war.  Not unlike the sisters in Downton Abbey, these young women have individual strengths and personalities.  Iris has had to run the family household since their mothers death, and May longs for a career on the stage but spends her day working as a maid for a well to do but unhappy couple.  The youngest daughter Ruby is a swimmer and trains every chance she gets hoping to earn a place on Britains Olympic swim team.  As the men are coming home from the war and taking up their jobs, she loses her job as a postmistress, but soon gets a position as a corsets saleslady to make money to add to the family finances. Brother Billy has been home longer than some of the other lads in the town, as he suffers from nerves having been serving in the Royal Navy when his ship was sunk in battle and he barely survived.  Obviously suffering from what we now know as PTSD he is anxious and cant settle on what to do with his life.  He and his father constantly clash over his inability to pick up an go to sea again.  The series was written by Heidi Thomas, creator of Call The Midwife, and like that series focuses on the people and how they cope with the difficulties of their lives.  This story has humor and pathos of the type that is familiar, making these characters seem very real.  I recommend it to everyone who enjoys period drama that has heartfelt moments.",1432166400,,1680,4.387096774193548

The sisters, like all 'dutiful daughters' of that era, take care of home and each other, but also harbor their own dreams. A girl who longs to be an Olympic swimming champion today is supported by family, school friends and her community; during that time, such a hope seems more fantasy than goal. The series was written by Heidi Thomas, whom we know for her currently popular ""Call the Midwife."" Lilies has echoes of the same sensitive perspective, depicting young women eager to make their way in an uncertain world. Their dad fondly calls the sisters his ""Lilies,"" hence the title--but while these three possess the beauty of floral lilies, they're also as strong as sturdy oaks.

2858273,5,B000R349IO,"LILIES, 2007.  In this touching British television series, set in Liverpool, 1920, shortly after World War I, three girls approaching womanhood find themselves in a world on the brink of change. Iris, May, and Ruby Moss come of age in a time when life, for many of their neighbors, is lived on the breadline.  The production was made by BBC Northern Ireland for BBC One.  This original eight-part period drama by acclaimed screenwriter Heidi Thomas, ( MADAME BOVARY, the recent UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS series and the very popular CALL THE MIDWIFE series),  is full of subtly textured period detail and biting modern wit. Catherine Tyldesley, Kerrie Hayes, and Leanne Rowe are the spirited sisters whom their charismatic and overbearing father Dadda Moss calls his lilies. The box set includes all eight episodes on 3 DVDs running approximately 467 minutes. There is also a behind the scenes featurette of 16 minutes, production notes, a photo gallery, and thank goodness, subtitles, for who on my side of the pond can claim familiarity with the Liverpudlian lingo? I received this as a review copy.

The family lives in largely Irish-immigrant working-class Liverpool.  As was then and there common, Iris, (Catherine Tyldesley, CORONATION STREET), eldest of the three sisters dutifully runs the household in the wake of the mother's death, as she is expected to.  Second daughter, the beautiful May (Leanne Rowe, OLIVER TWIST) works as a parlor maid but yearns for a less limited life; youngest daughter Ruby (Kerrie Hayes, THE MILL), in the wake of losing her good Post Office job to a returning vet, finds herself selling corsets while she trains to swim in the upcoming Olympics. The family is of mixed religions:  Dadda (Brian McCardie, LINE OF DUTY, ROB ROY), allowed his wife to raise her daughters in her Catholic religion, while he raised his sons in his Protestant religion.  Now the family, including their brother Billy (Daniel Rigby, FLYBOYS), who is shell-shocked, by the war, as they then called what we today call post-traumatic stress disorder, mourns their  mother and a younger brother killed in the war.

The costume dramas able actors ensemble also stars, as Mr. Brazendale, Mays employer, Stephen Moyer (TRUE BLOOD); as Father Malachi Melia, the girls priest, Scot Williams (REDIRECTED); as Mrs. Brazendale, Jennifer Hennessy (DROP DEAD GORGEOUS), and as the familys neighbor Frank Gadney, Iain McKee (HOUSEWIFE, 49).  The acting is universally strong, and serious efforts appear to have been made to capture time and place on the screen, in clothing, transportation, interior settings, and outhouses back of the terraced dockland houses.  The episodes are, with thanks to RLJEntertainment:

Disc 1
Episode 1: The Chit Behind King Billy
To help get the family pianola (player piano) out of hock for a street party honoring war vets, Ruby must take a job selling corsets, while she trains hard for the Olympic swimming tryouts. Brother Billy finds that  all the returning soldiers are not welcomed as heroes.
Episode 2: The Thunderbolt
Iris falls in love with a young magician who comes to the door in search of rabbits for his act. The family must face the unpromising prospect of life without her competence and self-sacrifice.
Episode 3: The White Charger
At tea with her employer, Mr. Brazendale, May meets a charming photographer with obvious designs on her. Meanwhile, Billy finds a stray white stallion in the woods; Dadda schemes to keep it for July 12, the centuries old Protestant Orange Parade.

Disc 2
Episode 4: The Tallyman
Scarlet fever invades the district; the family struggles to provide for seven orphaned children and stay a step ahead of the dreaded housing inspector. But, in secret, May becomes more occupied with Mr. Brazendale's renewed attentions.
Episode 5: The Sea
Nazzer, Billy's best friend from the pre-war neighborhood and the war itself returns, grievously injured, unable to care for himself. Some long-suppressed emotions threaten to engulf  the young men. May discovers that she is pregnant, then discovers that things aren't what she thought they were in the Brazendale household.
Episode 6: The Release
May makes every effort to conceal her condition; Ruby takes up with a group of newfound friends who introduce her to such liberating modern ideas as birth control, feminism and vegetarianism. May, however, seeks a different sort of release from her predicament.

Disc 3
Episode 7: The Serpent
Billy inadvertently brings home a snake; a local teacher invites Mr. Moss to discuss the exotic reptile in her class. Their relationship soon turns romantic, to the horror of his daughters. Then, to Daddas horror and rage, he learns of May's condition.
Episode 8: The Reckoning
After a life-threatening delivery, May rejects her baby, to await the return of Mr. Brazendale. Soon the turmoil created by Dadda's drunken flight from the family home, the neighbors' scorn, Iriss pursuit of a vocation ,and Mays vacillations in regard to the Brazendales reaches a climax in confrontation with the upper crust couple at the Brazendale estate.

The series, to this American, began slowly, but soon caught me up, as it was evocative, sexy, funny, thought-provoking, heartbreaking. The world in which the three sisters lived was harsh. And as they struggled through bleak poverty and disappointment, they came to realize they must rely on one another-- that their fortunes were bound to each others, their brothers and fathers and that family love was essential to their survival. In the end, I also appreciated the introduction of feminism, suffragist arguments, and yes, vegetarianism, as hints toward a better future. I found this production overwhelming, powerful and moving, as well as funny. Highly recommended.",1424131200,2,5758,5.178686759956943

2858296,5,B000R349IO,"Lilies is a stellar period drama- the story centers around a lower income family in post WW I England. There is Dadda, the patriarch of the Moss clan, who is a widower [his wife Mary having died 15 yrs earlier], his oldest daughter Iris, second daughter May, and twins Billy and Ruby. There was another son Walter who had died during the war. Together, the Moss family live through one crisis after another.

The center of the series is the lives of the three sisters - Iris is the oldest daughter who is selfless in her devotion to her family. She is the substitute mother for the Moss family, and apart from making sure the house is taken care of and meals cooked, she also works for the local bakery, making chocolates and other confectionery. But Iris secretly yearns to be a wife and mother, and have a family of her own, something that comes within her reach when she is courted by the conjurer Domingo, who appears to be the perfect suitor, but who harbors a secret that shatters Iris' dreams of domestic bliss. Iris also forms a close friendship with the parish priest who acts as confidante and friend to the Moss family, particularly Iris.

The second daughter May works as a maid for the rich Brazendales. Mrs. Brazendale yearns to be a mother, but suffers one miscarriage after another. Mr. Brazendale appears to be a charming gentleman, and May, who harbors dreams of making it into the pictures finds herself drawn to him, resulting in an affair that brings initial happiness, only to result in May's shattered dreams, and tarnished reputation when she finds herself in the family way.

The third daughter Ruby is feisty and fiercely opinionated. Ruby's dreams of becoming an Olympic swimmer are shattered when she suffers an injury and she then becomes a corset saleswoman. Along the way, Ruby becomes fascinated and drawn to an upper class woman whose ideas of modernization, vegetarianism, and notions on sex enthrall Ruby.

Ruby's twin brother Billy finds himself having a phobia of water after narrowly escaping death in the Battle of Jutland during the war. He also suffers from survivor's guilt and battles his confusion about his sexual identity.

The father Dadda Nelson is an intriguing character and played to perfection by the actor portraying him. He is at once a proud and loving dad, but can also become abusive and unyielding when his authority is challenged. Fiercely protective of his position as patriarch of the family, he detests any flaws in his children, failing to recognize the flaws in his own character.

This mini-series is truly engrossing. Each episode has a well-woven plot than transports you into the lives of the Moss family and their travails, and the attention to period details [the setting is post WW I] is authentic and wonderful. The score is beautiful as is the cinematography. The cast is simply excellent, there wasn't a performance I disliked, both main and fringe characters.

I have been a long-time fan of period dramas, and I have to say that Lilies truly is a gem that needs more exposure. I was very disappointed to find that there wasn't a Series 2 and hope they will come up with one soon for there are lots more stories to be told about the Moss family. Highly recommended!",1349913600,,3240,4.764705882352941
2858297,2,B000R349IO,"I'll start with the good points.  Lilies is extremely visually pleasing with good sets and production.  The costuming is a little off as skirts were longer than knee length inches early 20's, not rising until about 1926.  Dada was a good actor, playing the helpless bully with charm.  The two stars are for visual interest, the high concept and, well, that's it.

 The plot is ham fisted and if you can't guess what's going to happen then you must have been out getting a cup of tea because none of the twists are surprises.

The girls aren't especially good actors, although they are watchable, so long as you are expecting a soap opera and not a drama. The accents are unintelligible in places and there are no subtitles.

The thing that got to me, which was done in the name of realism, was the violence towards animals. We see a cat killed, a dog die, a rooster killed with a broom when Dada is in a temper and a total of four rabbits killed, three out of pique, in the first two episodes. Just because something is real isn't a reason to enjoy watching it. It made me feel sick and there are times when the music clearly indicates that it is supposed to be funny.
I'm not even going to go into the violence at the end or the emotional incest carried on throughout the series.

I expected this to be a nicer story, something I could watch when I'm feeling low but I would never watch it again.  The picture of three girls in their skivvies (never explained) on the cover should have been a clue that this series seeks only to titilate and shock, not to pleasantly entertain.

I have to get the bad taste out of my mouth now.  Excuse me.",1349049600,16,1640,4.340983606557377

Rich in detail,and loaded with real life dramas I found myself drawn into their family life within the first disc and by the begining of the second disc found myself compelled to watch into the wee hours of the morning. The only caveat I have is that the viewer must be warned of the heavy Irish accents of the actors... in particular the widowed father.

2858306,5,B000R349IO,"Lilies is a stellar period drama- the story centers around a lower income family in post WW I England. There is Dadda, the patriarch of the Moss clan, who is a widower [his wife Mary having died 15 yrs earlier], his oldest daughter Iris, second daughter May, and twins Billy and Ruby. There was another son Walter who had died during the war. Together, the Moss family live through one crisis after another.

The center of the series is the lives of the three sisters - Iris is the oldest daughter who is selfless in her devotion to her family. She is the substitute mother for the Moss family, and apart from making sure the house is taken care of and meals cooked, she also works for the local bakery, making chocolates and other confectionery. But Iris secretly yearns to be a wife and mother, and have a family of her own, something that comes within her reach when she is courted by the conjurer Domingo, who appears to be the perfect suitor, but who harbors a secret that shatters Iris' dreams of domestic bliss. Iris also forms a close friendship with the parish priest who acts as confidante and friend to the Moss family, particularly Iris.

The second daughter May works as a maid for the rich Brazendales. Mrs. Brazendale yearns to be a mother, but suffers one miscarriage after another. Mr. Brazendale appears to be a charming gentleman, and May, who harbors dreams of making it into the pictures finds herself drawn to him, resulting in an affair that brings initial happiness, only to result in May's shattered dreams, and tarnished reputation when she finds herself in the family way.

The third daughter Ruby is feisty and fiercely opinionated. Ruby's dreams of becoming an Olympic swimmer are shattered when she suffers an injury and she then becomes a corset saleswoman. Along the way, Ruby becomes fascinated and drawn to an upper class woman whose ideas of modernization, vegetarianism, and notions on sex enthrall Ruby.

Ruby's twin brother Billy finds himself having a phobia of water after narrowly escaping death in the Battle of Jutland during the war. He also suffers from survivor's guilt and battles his confusion about his sexual identity.

The father Dadda Nelson is an intriguing character and played to perfection by the actor portraying him. He is at once a proud and loving dad, but can also become abusive and unyielding when his authority is challenged. Fiercely protective of his position as patriarch of the family, he detests any flaws in his children, failing to recognize the flaws in his own character.

This mini-series is truly engrossing. Each episode has a well-woven plot than transports you into the lives of the Moss family and their travails, and the attention to period details [the setting is post WW I] is authentic and wonderful. The score is beautiful as is the cinematography. The cast is simply excellent, there wasn't a performance I disliked, both main and fringe characters.

I have been a long-time fan of period dramas, and I have to say that Lilies truly is a gem that needs more exposure. I was very disappointed to find that there wasn't a Series 2 and hope they will come up with one soon for there are lots more stories to be told about the Moss family.

Since it was not and there is little mention of that, it needs to be made known - the story doesn't end.  The conclusion on the last disc leaves a lot of unanswered questions, essentially one for each member of the family.  FYI, ****spoilers, sort of****, they are ALL still single at the end.  They each have potential love interests, but none of them are resolved.  We never know what happens, this isn't based on a book, its a series that wasn't brought back for a second season.

2858309,5,B000R349IO,"There is some confusion in the reviews published here about where Lilies is based, accents etc. Lilies is based in Liverpool and the accent is the Liverpool accent (apart from Dadda's). It is absolutely how people speak (yes even me!) so in this sense it is realistic.

My grandparents all grew up in the docklands of Liverpool and would have been teens-twenties in 1920s. Judging by what they told me, I would say that Lillies is very realistic for the times. Life was incredibly hard, there was lots of slum housing in the area and people were packed tightly together. That said, Liverpool people have always had the reputation of being able to stand up for themselves and the family in the series are even to this day, very typical.

If you want a romantic, pretty drama - forget it. If you want true life, where people were terrified of the scandals behind their frontdoors being tomorrow's gossip, you'll love it",1274313600,5,917,4.6894409937888195

The love and warmth they have for each other and their support carries them through.

2858311,4,B000R349IO,"Well, if you're tired of watching drawn out, self-agrandizing films about the horrors of war or the injustices visited upon one class or another and want a little more warmth, compassion and fun in a period setting - welcome to Lilies.

This miniseries centers around a lower-class family in the 1920's (set in Northern Ireland, I believe).  The family is comprised of one very volatile father, a rather subdued elder sister who is the main care-giver, a ""wild-sided"" middle sister, a bright emotional younger sister and a disturbed eldest brother just back from the war.  The storyline?  Basically, they get into all kinds of trouble, from the mundane sort to life's most difficult challenges in a tone that maintains a personal, ""non-overbearing"" quality throughout.

What I like best about the series is it's periods of humor.  So many books and films about post WWII or the advance of industrialization in Europe are utterly bleak and focus on the horror of life to the exclusion of all else.  Characters are wonderful, realistic and well-developed.

This miniseries makes you cry from time to time, laugh out loud and rejoice at least once in every episode.  And by that, I mean not the high-art sort of emotions so often portrayed in these things, but the day-to-day, real-life kind that keeps us all going.  It really touches you on that level.  As for history/period elements, they are presented as background - not a cultural, social or religious ""statement"" movie.  I found the treatment of the period made it easier digest and didn't distract from the storyline.

So, basically I'd recommend this film to anyone who has sisters, brothers or crazy relations - anyone who has ever tried to have a deep thought and wondered why it went so horribly wrong when they tried to act on it - or just plain cared about and supported someone in spite of the cost.  Each episode will make you want to watch the next.  Wish the BBC would take these characters to the next level - maybe we can convince them to do more.",1222560000,4,2015,4.76657060518732

As it centers around a working class middle-aged Britisher widower and his 4 young adult children, it offers a compelling story with wonderful actors including Stephen Moyer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood-The-Complete-First-Season-HBO-Series/dp/B001FB4W0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a>), top-notch set design and interesting character arcs.  However, if one of the characters falls in love you can be sure it is not going anywhere as none of them are going to leave their dysfunctional family.

There is a plot twist in the second episode that I didn't see coming and found rather disturbing but it probably could happen.  There are several very graphic scenes involving childbirth, miscarriage, suicide and the like.  Severely wounded veterans feature prominently in a couple of episodes and that is pretty graphic as well.  Beware the father's violent temper and after a while you start to be afraid for any domesticated animals that might be around while he is in full temper and has a meat cleaver handy.

My biggest complaint is none of the loose ends are really tied up at the end, so it has a television feel to it rather than the plot resolutions that have been set-up.  Also, unless you are a native speaker of the King's English, parts of dialogue need subtitles and they are not available.  This is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.

2858314,5,B000R349IO,"I can't say enough good things about this series.  The story lines are compelling and the acting is terrific. The series focuses on the lives of the Moss family and is set in post-WWI Liverpool. Living in the Moss household are the 3 daughters, the widowed father, and the surviving son, Billy. The father is of Irish descent (indeed, I think he's an Irish immigrant).  He is hard-working, capable of great sentimentality, and wants to hide the extent of the family's financial difficulties. He is both loved and feared (with good reason) by his children. He is passionately Irish - marching in annual parades that are part commemoration of Irish/British battles and part implicit political protest. The youngest son, Walter, who lied about his age in order to go to war, died shortly after entering the war. Billy, the older son, served in the Navy during the war, but after a naval disaster, was released because he had a nervous breakdown. He has to cope with his fears, shame and the community's perception of him as a coward.  (In the aftermath of the First World War, the psychological effects of battle were poorly understood.)

The Lilies are the 3 Moss daughters, Iris, May and Ruby.  All 3 are intelligent and passionate young women who love their family.  However, they demonstrate their passion in different ways: Ruby, Walter's twin, is hot-headed, impulsive and idealistic.  Her outbursts are at times quite funny. May dreams of being a famous actress; her naivete and subsequent despair lead her into folly.  Iris, who is the eldest daughter, seems buttoned-up much of the time, but she too has passion.  She wants to find a purpose in life beyond taking care of the household and making chocolates on a piece rate. She has a strict sense of morals and is a devout Catholic whose strongest non-family friendship is with Father Melia.

Other recurring, important characters are Frank, Father Melia (the young priest of the parish), the Brazendales (May's employers) and the young Austrian butcher.  Some characters who appear only in one or two episodes are pivotal; these include Dominic (episode 2) and Marianne Parks (episodes 6 & 7).

There are some very surprising story lines, but given the historical context and the particular characters involved, the story lines are believable.  There are a couple of scenes that may be too realistic for some viewers, but you can easily fast-forward through them.

Finally, the closed captioning DOES work.  It's just that you can't do it through your DVD remote.  You have to set the closed captioning on your TV and use the TV remote.  You also have to wait a couple of minutes for it to kick in.  I didn't realize this and watched the whole series without captioning, but there were several lines of dialogue I had to listen to more than once.  However, when I watched it again with my sister, she went through her TV remote & got the captioning to work.  I just now tried it again on my TV.  It didn't seem to work at first, but I played around with closed captioning on TV channels; once I got it to work there, I switched to the DVD and it worked just fine.",1216425600,8,3121,4.742592592592593

Bottom right states ""ACORN"" on new; old says ""Acorn Media."" It's worth owning the new for subtitles as 1920's Irish and Liverpool accents are accurately strong. It's an amazing series, a classic.

""Lilies"" is the creative genius (and some family history) of Heidi Thomas; who won a Writers Award and was ""Lilies"" creator, writer, producer who also became known for ""Cranford"", ""Upstairs Downstairs"", ""I Captured the Castle"", & ""Call the Midwife."" The amazing period sets are hand built, no computer art. Costumes are perfection.

A Celtic family is led by Dadda Moss, a widower and Orangeman with a heart and temper. Before her death, the wife raised their 3 girls Catholic. Son Billy's a Navy vet, a second was a WWI causality. They find 1920-21 life in Garston, Liverpool hard, and the times with no welfare. Each of the family has issues with society, employment, and a love relationship found-then-lost. But the family eventually clings together thru all dysfunctional events imaginable. ""Lilies"" is the story of the family affairs.

2858317,4,B000R349IO,"Wow, I really can't stop watching this thing.  Secrets, lies, corruption, adultery, sickness, unwanted pregnancies, hidden scars- figuratively and literally, anger, sex, suicide, lots of conniving tomfoolery and a bit of humor thrown in so we can breath until the next storm.

The Moss family lives, strives, smolders and explodes in a day by day type fashion.  It highly entertaining, even addicting.  Some would say it's reality for the times.  Perhaps.  But not to this concentrated, over the top, fashion.  It's basically an extremely, well-made, English soap opera.

The acting is 5 star.  Dadda is my favorite character, likable and despicable, ever volatile.  He looks a little like Charles Chaplin.  A widower, he needs to stay that way.  The three Lilies: May the maid with no sense, Ruby the feminist, maybe communist, maybe New Ager, always opinionated, and Iris the pseudo-mother Madonna, all struggle with their identities and men and each other.  Billy the only boy struggles, too, with sexual identity and household position.  Except for one episode, he is way under utilized.

The sets show the dark and dismal contrast of Moss's Liverpool vs. the opulence where May gets to work and probably wished she hadn't, or where Ruby's 'friends' hang out in their political and judgmental enlightment

The supporting cast also shines. The priest carries the torch and morals for all and languishes in his own imperfection stating ""that God (must be) imperfect since he made man in His own image.""  I quess he skipped Genesis and the Fall.  Back to catechism with you.  The policeman is sympathetic, but somewhat insipid, and the neighbors always worry about the latest gossip, epidemic, Tallyman or the Moss's bathroom.

The family that stays together doesn't necessarily pray together- not if you're the Moss's.  More like rages together.  And will somebody put away the dishes before Dadda gets home.  There's no comfortable, gushy romance; nothing's comfortable; there's always something stalking around the corner ready to rip the relative calm asunder. It wears me out.

2858325,5,B000R349IO,"...so addicted was I to the next turn of the plot!

""Lilies"" follows the lives of the Moss family, led by Nelson ""Dadda"", comprised of son William (Billy) and daughters Iris, May, and Ruby.  Mrs. Mary Moss has been dead approximately 15 years and Iris, the eldest, has become the lady of the house.  Dadda works as an amateur veterinarian and herbalist.  Iris creates confections and sells them to a local sweets store.  May is in service to the nouveau-riche Mr. and Mrs. Brazendale.  Ruby, William's twin and the youngest, just starts into peddling women's corsets at the beginning of the series.

The Mosses live in the early 1920s in Liverpool, and their lives are mirros of the times.  The influx of jazz music and the popularity of the silent films persist throughout; the beginnings of social change through contraception and women's suffrage figure into it as well.

Religious differences and class distinction also play large roles.  Dadda, an Ulsterman, is vigorously Protestant, and his sons were raised in his church--elder son Walter having perished in action in World War I.
The Moss daughters were raised in their mother's Roman Catholic faith (although their names would hardly have been given Baptismal approval for the era of their birth -- the 1890s -- by any Catholic priest, as none of them are saints names).  On more than one occasion the division of churches causes issues within the family.  Young Rev. Malachi Melia, the pastor of the girls' parish, plays a large role in many episodes.

The daughters are the central figures in this series, given its title from a toast made by Dadda that, while the bulbs he'd planted in the little garden on Portugal Street as a newly-married (and very young) man never prospered, he'd been blessed by ""my girls, who are my lilies"".

Iris is common-sensical but harbors a yearning for her own marriage and motherhood.  The unlikely-named Domingo appears the perfect match--until a secret dismantles Iris' hopes and dreams.  May, who initially seems as sensible as her elder sister, ends up in the midst of high drama with her employer, becoming pregnant by him.  Ruby, the feistiest of the trio, becomes entranced by the social movements of women's liberation and embraces vegetarianism, even as her own dreams of swimming for the British Olympic team are dashed early on in the storyline.

Billy is a sad soul, having witnessed Naval action at the Battle of Jutland, only to be sent home, a victim of post-traumatic stress.  Dadda is a man desperate to keep his family together, although his own violent temperment makes for some of the clan's worst problems.  Toward the end of the series Dadda attempts to introduce his new romantic interest, Myrtle Bird, to his offspring, but she is soundly rejected--this was the only time I found Dadda sympathetic, as Miss Bird was more than appropriate for him and very clearly a good match for him.

""Lilies"" truly offers it all--suicidal thoughts, adultery, bad marriages, sexual identity, class struggle, religious tension--except for a juicy murder, it covers a vast panorama of human conditions, struggles, tragedies, and, ultimately, victories.",1200268800,115,3154,5.015355086372361

8198718,5,B000R349IO,"Don't be put off by the fact that this series was produced for only one season---these eight episodes all are wonderful, and the finale wraps things up nicely without resorting to fairytale happy endings for everyone. The ""lilies"" are of course the sisters, but don't disregard the contributions of the father and brother to the storylines: this series is altogether about family, love of family, obligation and duty to family, pride in family.

Time period aside, this is no Downton Abbey---this is working-class England, with a constant attention paid to making money to keep the household going. In the most trying times, there is a general can-do attitude here (""I'll fight my own corner!"" one sister yells at a friend stepping into an argument to take her side.) Naturally there are some troubles thrown in for dramatic effect, but they didn't seem overly contrived. The three sisters, father, and brother all have compelling storylines, and I liked the fact that things stayed focused on the main characters.

Great production value, authentic performances, and characters you can root for. Note: I watched this via Netflix, and resorted to turning on the subtitles so I wouldn't miss out on any of the dialogue (loved the strong Liverpool accents, but as an American I did struggle a bit to understand at times). This series is definitely worth another watch all things considered!",1486166400,,1388,5.056768558951965
8198719,4,B000R349IO,The story lines were great. Only drawback was the accents that were a little hard to understand.  Showed the hardships of the times.,1485993600,,132,4.739130434782608
