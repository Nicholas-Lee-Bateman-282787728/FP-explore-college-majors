First thing he does is panhandle $15 then uses the whole thing to buy breakfast at Starbucks.  It hasn't sunk in yet.  Anyway the dialogue is genuine, the people are real, however the point of the movie is we need to do something is lost on me.  Every society from US to UK to India to Mexico and in between has these same people.  Every society since Imperial Rome had these same people.  No amount of ""help"" or handouts or ""hand ups"" is going to solve it, there are people who are mentally ill or addicted or just don't want to help themselves.  You can round them up and house them but someone else will come take their place.  I'm not trying to be heartless but I am trying to point out that the old approaches aren't working, until someone figures out something new, like maybe providing dorms with unlimited drugs and alcohol so the addicted can get their fix without living on the street, or find a pill that will suddenly turn off low self-esteem and craving.

One was the fact that although it is a poor area there are some who have chosen to be there NOT ALL of them. This literally shows you almost every type of individual you might meet. The functioning addict who believes he is in the only place he/she wants to be. The addict who never saw the fall coming yet has hit rock bottom and just wants out.
There are even people who come in search of loved ones to feed them and show them they are loved. To let them know that are available to them when or if they ever want to get out. Many are homeless for many different reasons. From viewing this I would say that drugs are a coping mechanism a means to an end. Definitely provokes me to think in a different direction.",1419811200,,819,4.222929936305732

Nine dollars and a tent - that's all hip-hop artist Pras Michel (of The Fugees) brings with him when he goes undercover to live on Skid Row disguised as a homeless person.  His purpose?  To experience first hand what life is like for those who live on the streets, and to share that experience with the world at large.  ""Skid Row"" documents the nine days and nights he spent trying to make it in the homeless capital of the world, Los Angeles.

The movie hits us with a slew of depressing statistics and provides a brief history of the place, while Pras learns how to survive through begging and panhandling and by maneuvering his way through a world few of us will ever know - or even care to acknowledge. The movie, shot with a hidden camera, is a fairly straight-forward documentary, though the substandard sound recording makes some of the dialogue hard to make out.  But the message shines through in Pras' heartbreaking encounters with drug addicts, runaways, and friends and families of individuals who have gone missing and may be living on Skid Row.

The enormity and seeming intractability of the problem can make watching this film an overwhelming experience for the viewer, but there are glimmers of hope in seeing how many of the individuals who work with the homeless were themselves down-and-out at one point in their lives (many are themselves recovering addicts), but somehow managed to pull themselves up and are now giving back to those they left behind.

Pras and the others involved in the project deserve praise for their courage and gratitude for opening our eyes to this terrible human and social scourge that should concern us all.",1348099200,,1664,4.793706293706293
3060424,1,B001152TLG,"In the 1st day, Pras made around $20 in a short time begging. Pras has gotten the art of begging down and was getting into the hang of begging.  Pras seems to have a natural talent for begging.  But that should not really be a surprise as it takes a certain talent in begging & salesmanship for Pras to rise to the top of his field.  You can tell how proud Pras was of his begging skill from the gleam in his eyes.  I would not be surprise that he was thinking after this movie shooting was over, he would probably dress up in bums clothes and go out begging again to keep his begging skill in shape.  Unfortunately for Pras, his begging career will be short live.

The Beggar Clan did not like Pras muscling into their territory so they reported him. Thus a black & white stop by and gave him a warning. As Pras is not organized like the Beggar Clan, Pras did not have a police lookout and must stop begging.

In the next couple of days, you will see a couples of criminal activities being committed and not reported. One man was being assaulted and so was another woman. Of course you have the illegal activities of drug uses.

A University study shows that 2 out of 3 of the homeless are convicted criminals.  And with Skid Row being around 1 miles South of the twin tower jail, quite a few of these homeless are criminals release from twin tower jail nearby with no where to go and that is why they are out there on Skid Row.

Pras forgot that these are criminals he is dealing with, got careless and got his tent stolen and he had no place to stay. By the time he got his tent stolen, the Beggar Clan figures out who he is and they stay away from him and his crew. The homeless on the street did not show him the rope so he ends up staying at one of the Homeless Mission. He slips and that is how they figure out who he is. Can you see where he slips?

After the beggar clan figures out who Pras is, all the criminal activities observed previously just disappear from the camera as when you shine lights on cockroaches, they will just scatter & disappear. The rest is just boring propaganda through deception, ruse & staging that you would see normally on television.

But propaganda is to be expected. As you can't tell people to give you moneys for your Mission so you can pay yourself & your crew 6 figures and provide place for criminals to stay while they commit crime against the people to support their drug habits. If you listen carefully, you will notice that it was stated that some of the homeless, beggar clan, are able to generate $30,000 a months through criminal activities to support their drug addiction. Don't get puzzle if you did not notice the part about how some of these street/skid row people makes $30,000 a month the first time watching the video. I heard about it 20 years ago so I pick it up the first time watching the video.

In the end, Pras was never shown the rope and will not see that side of the beggar clan since they figure out who he is.

Don't quit your day job to work undercover or intellegence Pras.  As you will just blow your cover real fast or provide inaccurate intelligences and start another Iraq war by assserting that Iraq has weapon of Mass Destruction when you can't even recognize a weapon of Mass Deception.

20/20, 60 Minutes and the History Channel had programs that had better undercover work & investigative news reporting than this DVD about Skid Row.

Note:
(1) In 2009, during the recession, Americans gave $304 billions to charities.  At the same time, the Mexico drug war that killed as many people as the Iraq war generated $32 billions.  Mathematically it proves that propagandas, deceptions, ruses & stagings are 9.5 times more effective than violences & killings (304/32=9.5).
(2) And in 2012, Americans gave $335 billions to charities, thus propagandas, deceptions, ruses & stagings are much more effective than violences & killings

----------------------------------------------------------------

Update 09/14/2010

I recently notice that there is a new campaign in homeless charity having to do with children.  Donations are asked to help homeless children.

But under the law, it is illegal for minor under 18 yrs to be without parent or guardian.  If a minor does not have a parent, they must go to into a foster care system.  Thus if anyone see a child, whether homeless or not, without a parent or guardian they must report them to social service to be help.  Not exploit them like common criminals for charitable donations.

Thus there seems to be a contradiction here between what is the law versus what homeless children campaign is promoting.  And this campaign seems to be going very well.

As a master salesman once told me during my training, ""There is a sucker born every minutes...LOL :)"".  Are you a sucker?",1270857600,3,4799,4.5453488372093025

First thing he does is panhandle $15 then uses the whole thing to buy breakfast at Starbucks.  It hasn't sunk in yet.  Anyway the dialogue is genuine, the people are real, however the point of the movie is we need to do something is lost on me.  Every society from US to UK to India to Mexico and in between has these same people.  Every society since Imperial Rome had these same people.  No amount of ""help"" or handouts or ""hand ups"" is going to solve it, there are people who are mentally ill or addicted or just don't want to help themselves.  You can round them up and house them but someone else will come take their place.  I'm not trying to be heartless but I am trying to point out that the old approaches aren't working, until someone figures out something new, like maybe providing dorms with unlimited drugs and alcohol so the addicted can get their fix without living on the street, or find a pill that will suddenly turn off low self-esteem and craving.

One was the fact that although it is a poor area there are some who have chosen to be there NOT ALL of them. This literally shows you almost every type of individual you might meet. The functioning addict who believes he is in the only place he/she wants to be. The addict who never saw the fall coming yet has hit rock bottom and just wants out.
There are even people who come in search of loved ones to feed them and show them they are loved. To let them know that are available to them when or if they ever want to get out. Many are homeless for many different reasons. From viewing this I would say that drugs are a coping mechanism a means to an end.

Nine dollars and a tent - that's all hip-hop artist Pras Michel (of The Fugees) brings with him when he goes undercover to live on Skid Row disguised as a homeless person.  His purpose?  To experience first hand what life is like for those who live on the streets, and to share that experience with the world at large.  ""Skid Row"" documents the nine days and nights he spent trying to make it in the homeless capital of the world, Los Angeles.

The movie hits us with a slew of depressing statistics and provides a brief history of the place, while Pras learns how to survive through begging and panhandling and by maneuvering his way through a world few of us will ever know - or even care to acknowledge. The movie, shot with a hidden camera, is a fairly straight-forward documentary, though the substandard sound recording makes some of the dialogue hard to make out.  But the message shines through in Pras' heartbreaking encounters with drug addicts, runaways, and friends and families of individuals who have gone missing and may be living on Skid Row.

The enormity and seeming intractability of the problem can make watching this film an overwhelming experience for the viewer, but there are glimmers of hope in seeing how many of the individuals who work with the homeless were themselves down-and-out at one point in their lives (many are themselves recovering addicts), but somehow managed to pull themselves up and are now giving back to those they left behind.

Pras and the others involved in the project deserve praise for their courage and gratitude for opening our eyes to this terrible human and social scourge that should concern us all.",1348099200,,1664,4.793706293706293
3294921,1,B001152TLG,"In the 1st day, Pras made around $20 in a short time begging. Pras has gotten the art of begging down and was getting into the hang of begging.  Pras seems to have a natural talent for begging.  But that should not really be a surprise as it takes a certain talent in begging & salesmanship for Pras to rise to the top of his field.  You can tell how proud Pras was of his begging skill from the gleam in his eyes.  I would not be surprise that he was thinking after this movie shooting was over, he would probably dress up in bums clothes and go out begging again to keep his begging skill in shape.  Unfortunately for Pras, his begging career will be short live.

The Beggar Clan did not like Pras muscling into their territory so they reported him. Thus a black & white stop by and gave him a warning. As Pras is not organized like the Beggar Clan, Pras did not have a police lookout and must stop begging.

In the next couple of days, you will see a couples of criminal activities being committed and not reported. One man was being assaulted and so was another woman. Of course you have the illegal activities of drug uses.

A University study shows that 2 out of 3 of the homeless are convicted criminals.  And with Skid Row being around 1 miles South of the twin tower jail, quite a few of these homeless are criminals release from twin tower jail nearby with no where to go and that is why they are out there on Skid Row.

Pras forgot that these are criminals he is dealing with, got careless and got his tent stolen and he had no place to stay. By the time he got his tent stolen, the Beggar Clan figures out who he is and they stay away from him and his crew. The homeless on the street did not show him the rope so he ends up staying at one of the Homeless Mission. He slips and that is how they figure out who he is. Can you see where he slips?

After the beggar clan figures out who Pras is, all the criminal activities observed previously just disappear from the camera as when you shine lights on cockroaches, they will just scatter & disappear. The rest is just boring propaganda through deception, ruse & staging that you would see normally on television.

But propaganda is to be expected. As you can't tell people to give you moneys for your Mission so you can pay yourself & your crew 6 figures and provide place for criminals to stay while they commit crime against the people to support their drug habits. If you listen carefully, you will notice that it was stated that some of the homeless, beggar clan, are able to generate $30,000 a months through criminal activities to support their drug addiction. Don't get puzzle if you did not notice the part about how some of these street/skid row people makes $30,000 a month the first time watching the video. I heard about it 20 years ago so I pick it up the first time watching the video.

In the end, Pras was never shown the rope and will not see that side of the beggar clan since they figure out who he is.

Don't quit your day job to work undercover or intellegence Pras.  As you will just blow your cover real fast or provide inaccurate intelligences and start another Iraq war by assserting that Iraq has weapon of Mass Destruction when you can't even recognize a weapon of Mass Deception.

20/20, 60 Minutes and the History Channel had programs that had better undercover work & investigative news reporting than this DVD about Skid Row.

Note:
(1) In 2009, during the recession, Americans gave $304 billions to charities.  At the same time, the Mexico drug war that killed as many people as the Iraq war generated $32 billions.  Mathematically it proves that propagandas, deceptions, ruses & stagings are 9.5 times more effective than violences & killings (304/32=9.5).
(2) And in 2012, Americans gave $335 billions to charities, thus propagandas, deceptions, ruses & stagings are much more effective than violences & killings

----------------------------------------------------------------

Update 09/14/2010

I recently notice that there is a new campaign in homeless charity having to do with children.  Donations are asked to help homeless children.

But under the law, it is illegal for minor under 18 yrs to be without parent or guardian.  If a minor does not have a parent, they must go to into a foster care system.  Thus if anyone see a child, whether homeless or not, without a parent or guardian they must report them to social service to be help.  Not exploit them like common criminals for charitable donations.

Thus there seems to be a contradiction here between what is the law versus what homeless children campaign is promoting.  And this campaign seems to be going very well.

As a master salesman once told me during my training, ""There is a sucker born every minutes...LOL :)"".  Are you a sucker?",1270857600,3,4799,4.5453488372093025

8240526,4,B001152TLG,"Much respect for Pras and the documentary crew to do this.  Unfortunately, homelessness has not gotten any better since then.  As of 2016, the homeless population stood at 47,000 in Los Angeles.  L.A. is notorious for un-sheltered homelessness on top of it.  The real estate and cost of living in Los Angeles is going up and up. I'm not sure if Amazon will block my review if I put in sources so you'll need to do your own research. It seems the city is gentrifying in a lot of parts in Los Angeles.  Downtown L.A. is one of the areas where it has been and is steadily being gentrified.  It seems there was a white flight at one point, now the ""well to do"" are starting to move back in downtown L.A. and those once abandoned properties have been turned into expensive lofts/condos/apartments that most people can't afford.  America is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and our tax dollars we pay aren't fixing this issue?  Our politicians have to do WAY, WAY, WAY better.  There are so many social service jobs and construction jobs that can be created to not only give people work, but more importantly can help out while doing what they went to college or got their trade for. Heck, some of the homeless, if they showed the effort and are willing and able, could probably fill some of those positions created by the government. If any politician ever experienced homelessness like Skid Row, this unfortunate issue would probably be taken care overnight.",1491091200,3,1466,4.629343629343629

He panhandled all day for 15 dollars and spent it all at a fast food joint on one meal. Then, during the first night you here screaming and a gunshot, but no explanation, even though the victim and cops were filmed. After that I had a hard time believing he didn't reach out to his crew for fast food money. Also it became apparent in the final days that everyone knew he was filming and that is considered NARC behavior and justifies killing those associated with him. That is when he realized his time was up. He was putting innocent lives in danger. Good documentary in spite of the above mentioned flaws. Since this was filmed before the meltdown, it is dated and times have changed quite a bit.",1489622400,5,916,4.42603550295858
