8124191,3,B000FKP0PK,"N.B. This is the exact same production as 'History's Mysteries - The Children's Crusade'. I know because I bought both of them at the same time thinking i was getting loads of information on this strange series of events.

A 45 minute production. 18.5 minutes of which are on the Crusades in general...

Come on! I wanted to learn about the Children's Crusade. I feel like a wasted my money on a product that spends over a third of the time explaining a different subject. There is so much out there on the Crusades it can't be that people needed an almost 20 minute intro into the crusades themselves before delving into the actual topic.

At one point I actually thought they were not going to talk about the Children's Crusade at all, and that I had been duped.

Anyway I still gave it 3 stars because the content is still interesting. Anyway, I have since ripped it and uploaded it to YouTube for anyone interested.",1405209600,,919,4.518072289156627
