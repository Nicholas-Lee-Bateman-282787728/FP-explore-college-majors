8185709,5,B000ONXQUY,"I have been a fan of Ray Comfort since his book, ""Hell's Best Kept Secret.""  It is good to see his book premise played out in real time. It does cause thought. I have played it for my College-aged (18-21 y.o.) Sunday School class and two of our young men! went forward that very day in an altar call - one for salvation, the other, already a Believer, selected us as his new church home. The one needing salvation has since been baptized and both have become members of our church. It is very relevant and hits people where they live, drawing them to the logical conclusion about what is needed in their lives. My only disappointment is in not seeing the fruit of the effort, by seeing people pray to receive Christ. I would love to know their reasons for that. Highly recommended for outreach, and for those who are hard to convince/receive.",1346284800,4,842,4.467532467532467
