I attempted to use the various menus to find them without success.  So, I will gift this item to a friend who is learning Russian and order another version that also says it has sub-titles.  I still want to see the movie!",1472860800,,342,4.573770491803279

8056830,5,B00092ZL0S,"I haven't bought this DVD yet, but I'm 99% sure I saw the movie as a child, perhaps in 1979 in New Delhi. I think it was titled ""Five Women"", just to keep things simple. It's amazing that after 30 years, upon reading the reviews, a couple of scenes came rushing back from my memory. I saw it on public TV in black and white and remember a feeling of being punched in the stomach after the movie was over. No it is not depressing, but it reminds you of the sheer senselessness and brutality of war, and the sense of waste - of young, beautiful lives. Just imagine, if scum like Hitler, Chamberlain, Churchill and Stalin had never walked the earth, how many dozens of millions of young lives would have lived to a ripe old age.

The movie has a lot of chase scenes that are gripping. The sergeant is very charismatic and is like a father to the five women.

If you want to know why Russia won WWII, then you must watch this film. The five Russian women soldiers fight fiercely and fearlessly despite being surrounded and outgunned. The Russians are amazing warriors, yet their humanity is touching. Hitler had no chance.

This DVD goes into my must buy wish list for 2010.",1264204800,4,1170,4.382488479262673
8056831,5,B00092ZL0S,"This is a film for the lovers of the good old days of the USSR. It's the kind of movie we'd have today if George Bush had a man sitting behind the director of every movie made in Hollywood. Having said that, it is a pretty good film, especially for those who like war films. It looks back at WW2 from the vantage point of 1972. The events dealt with in the movie are realistic and the soldiers are presented in a realistic manner. So there's two things different from what you'd find in an American film of that time. The way the story unfolds is predictably Soviet. This film is more accurate historically than the typical American movie of the war made back then. The uniforms and military protocol, as far as I can tell, are on the money. The Germans are also depicted accurately. There is a very interesting scene with one of the girls at her anti-aircraft gun shooting down a German plane. Also accurate. Best of all, there's a great party in the banya with the girls getting steam cleaned. The film has good sound in Russian and subtitles in at least English and French, maybe more. Anybody who collects war films should have this one.",1207699200,3,1141,4.438095238095238
8056832,4,B00092ZL0S,"Here is another great piece of Russian cinema about WW2, alongside Klimov's 'Come and See' and Alekseyev's 'Destiny Of A Man'. There are no high production values to speak of in 'The Dawns Here Are Quiet', the cinematography is workmanlike but the direction is deft and the performances solid.  'The Dawns..' is the compelling story of a raggle taggle artillery unit and their wartime misadventures. Yuri Sorokin plays the hard bitten sergeant who is lumbered with a new unit to knock into shape - to his horror it turns out to be entirely made of women. Imagine Clint in Heartbreak Ridge having to adopt a crew of girl rookies into his crack recon unit....that gives you a good point of reference for the humour and drama that unfolds in this highly under-rated movie. Enjoy.

8056833,5,B00092ZL0S,"This film, made in 1972, harks back to an era when, in war movies, emotion and character development were more important than gore and military hardware.  This is Soviet Russian film at its finest, with great acting, luminous cinematography, lyrical music, human warmth and empathy, and a bittersweet feeling that infuses joyous and tragic, humorous and heroic events.  Although the film clearly isn't a critique of Stalin's blunders and the brutality of communism (it wouldn't have been made otherwise), it still manages to give a feel of the unimaginable sacrifices ordinary Russian people had to make to win the war of annihilation that the Nazis unleashed on them, with very little of the jingoism of official ""socialist realism.""

The story is set in remote northwest Russia, and starts with the complaints of the village commandant, sergeant-major Vaskov, about the drunken, womanizing crews of anti-aircraft gunners the Red Army keeps sending him.  He gets his wish soon enough, when a group of young women gunners arrives to replace the last sad lot.  Vaskov at first does not know how to deal with them, then grumpily starts bonding with them.

The story focuses on five of the women, using ironic/stylized romantic flashbacks (shot in color--apart from flashbacks, daydreams and a flash-forward the film is black and white) to acquaint us with their personal stories.  Soon enough, one of them discovers two German paratroopers in the woods, and Vaskov sets off with the five women volunteers to catch the intruders.  The two turn out to be 16 highly trained men intent on some undefined serious mischief.  The rest of the film uses the deadly pursuit to explore what these six characters (the wily yet sentimental older sergeant major, the young war widow, the poet, the wayward woman, the foundling, the earnest lovelorn lass) are made of.  In a game of cat-and mouse through the northern forests, swamps and lakes the six are pitted against the Nazi team.  Who will survive?  How will each of them behave in extreme situations?  Will reinforcements arrive in time?  Suffice it to say that war is tragedy, and happy endings in tragedies are rare.

This is a film that may move too slowly for modern audiences.  The tension comes not so much from plot twists and turns, but from caring about the fate of the characters, whom we have come to know and understand.  I've always been a sucker for all the tools the director uses, from lyrical music mostly in minor keys to the luminous beauty of Russian actresses.  All these tools (or manipulations, if one wants to be cynical) feel just right for the purpose of salvaging something uplifting from the unimaginable tragedy that World War II was for Russia.  This film is a classic.",1185840000,5,2739,4.928104575163399
8056834,5,B00092ZL0S,"A zori zdes tikhie (1972) ...aka The Dawns Here Are Quiet - is an honest, realistic and very fine Soviet War film which is sadly un-known to the Western audiences. It was directed by a very talented director Stanislav Rostotsky who also made two of my favorite films, Belyy Bim - Chyornoe ukho (1970) ... aka White Bim Black Ear and Dozhivyom do ponedelnika (1969) aka We'll Live Till Monday .

Rostotsky chose perfect cast - the young and unknown performers who all shone in his movie. I also highly recommend the book by Boris Vasilyev of the same title - I still remember the day when I first read that rather short but unforgettable story about five young girls and their corporal Vaskov who was much older and who was not used to deal with the women-soldiers. What started as a comedy, soon became a compelling and gripping drama depicting an unequal fight of the group of five women and their leader against 16 Nazi paratroopers, specially trained and deadly dangerous that penetrated deep beyond the front-line.",1169596800,14,1018,4.719101123595506
8056835,5,B00092ZL0S,"I cannot top the above review for detail or passion. I can add to it by saying this filmed should be viewed and studied by all...especially old, corrupt men who send youngsters thousands of miles to do their bidding.

  This film is one of defense, loyality, love of country and culture and is also a striking example of WWII Soviet womanhood. The characters are so rich and thoughful and the direction expands their emotions and fears, hopes and dreams. Absolutely first rate.

  Russian cinema is not about happy endings...because war, even in victory, is tragic. Yet it is about hope and courage, two things sadly missing from todays society.

  It is also a chance for others to see how advanced Soviet culture was concerning things as common as simple nudity. Here it's celebrated and cultivated, in Western cinema it would've been considered evil or base. By the same token the film chooses not to gush blood from wounds etc...something Western cinema relishes and finds 'acceptable.' One has to wonder who's culture is truly rich and natural...and non explotive.

  I adored this film...one of my favorites now. Please give it a chance and I'm quite sure you'll learn something both rich and valuable. If I could give this film 10 stars I gladly would....",1153267200,38,1262,4.873239436619718
8056836,5,B00092ZL0S,"This excellent and faithful rendition of Boris Vassilyev's ""A zori zdes' tikhie..."" is finally available on Amazon!  The novella and film are beloved in Russia and count among my own personal favorites.  The setting is May 1942, a remote artillery base somewhere north of besieged Leningrad and west of bombed-out Murmansk.  Sergeant Major Fedot Vaskov is exasperated with the misbehavior of his gunners and demands replacements: ""No drunks!  No womanizers!""  He gets his wish when his entire regiment is replaced with teenage girl gunners fresh out of artillery training.  Confusion reigns when the very conservative Vaskov must deal with the decidedly unsoldierly girlish antics of his troops.  And each girl comes to the Army with a personal history: a tragedy, a disgrace, a hardship, a vengeance, a purpose. Together, they defy their frazzled starshina (Vaskov) and bond with eachother.  Then one morning two German paratroopers are sighted in the woods.  Vaskov and a squad of five girls set out to capture the enemy:  Beautiful, bold Zhenya, the only survivor of her massacred Army family.  Rita, a young mother, already widowed by the war.  Painfully shy Galya, raised in an orphanage.  Liza, the sturdy but daydreaming daughter of a drunken forester.  And the translator, Sonya, who fears for her Jewish family in Minsk.  She had been studying in Moscow when Belorussia fell to the Fascists.  Little do any of them realize, there are not two but sixteen Germans, not simply soldiers but highly trained, armed-to-the-teeth special forces!  Vaskov and his untrained troops must distract the enemy, delay their mission, and alert headquarters of their presence.  A matter of duty soon becomes a matter of life and death.  Under fire the girls bond with their Sergeant Major and display individual ingenuity and valor.  But this is a story about war and none of these Russians is a ""Rambo.""  I've read the novella and watched the video a dozen times and always shed tears. Never-the-less, the story is inspiring, not depressing; and is considered one of the most realistic depictions of the War by a Soviet author.  It has retained its popularity because of its endearing theme: the courage of ordinary Soviet people.  I hope the DVD will have English subtitles so that non-Russian speakers will finally have a chance to experience this famous film.",1117411200,44,2354,5.104712041884817
