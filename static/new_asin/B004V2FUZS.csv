The 1990 Hindi film `Karishma Kali Kaa' is a surprisingly entertaining tale combining several thematic elements that will appeal to a wide ranging audience: good versus evil, revenge, an attractive heroine (Amrita Singh), a moral lesson, and a personal appearance by the Goddess Kali. Can't beat that!

To be sure this movie is light years away from the many quality Hindi films released in the last several years. Actually `Karishma Kali Kaa' reminds me quite a bit of the American low budget B horror films that were extremely popular when I was growing up in the 50's. The comic book style dialogue, the overall poor acting and the makeshift sets that are at times hysterical (just watch the nightclub sequence and tell me you didn't laugh out loud) all somehow seems to work.

If you're like me and don't speak Hindi you'll have the bonus fun of reading some of the most horrendously translated subtitles ever. For example, at one point I think one of the `bad guys' was saying ""don't give me any static"". The on screen subtitle read ""don't give me current"". Needless to say there's not a lot of depth or artistic merit here but again like the 50's B films for some reason you can't help but keep watching.

Not to just sit here and make fun of the film, I happened to enjoy Amrita Singh's performance and some of the musical song and dance numbers (except for the nightclub) were very good. I absolutely loved the last one performed in front of the Kali statue. Also, the unexpected moral / spiritual teaching at the end not only took me somewhat by surprise but added some important context to the storyline that made it even more enjoyable. I'm certain that my -4 Star- rating is far beyond what 'Karishma Kali Kaa' really deserves but sometimes you just like something for no reason. A guilty pleasure you might say.",1304985600,,1886,4.671686746987952
