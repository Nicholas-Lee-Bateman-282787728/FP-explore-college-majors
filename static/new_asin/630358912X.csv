692380,5,630358912X,"This is a great movie, very sad at times, but great none the less.  I love Dudley Moores interaction with the young girl, her willingness to be happy despite her situation, she doesn't give up.  The music was great and of course when the young girl dances it was magic. I recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites.",1234137600,,319,4.389830508474576
692381,5,630358912X,"I first watched this movie when I was about 18.  I was pretty self absorbed at that time as most 18 year olds and emotionally numb.  This movie still made me cry like I was a little girl.  Anybody who doesn't cry at this movie probably didn't cry at ""Old Yeller"" either.  I have been searching for this movie since I was eighteen which was 20 years ago, and I paid $40.00 for a VHS tape of it.  It stuck in my mind for that long.  Yes, it is that good.  I will be sorry when I wear it out.  Mary Tyler Moore is classy, and all that a lady should be in this movie. I hope anybody that watches it enjoys it as much as most of the rest of us obviously have.",1220400000,2,654,3.828358208955224
692382,5,630358912X,I was so extremely happy when I found this movie~ I loved this movie. It is well acted by all the cast..whew it is definitely a tear jerker but definitely a MUST see.  If you like dramas and tear jerkers..this one is it~,1130371200,4,220,4.116279069767442
692383,5,630358912X,"I disagree with those who have any reservations about this film. It is a wonderful story, perfectly acted by its principals and supporting cast, properly but unobtrusively filmed and edited.
To list predictability as a point of criticism is absurd. If predictability is the criterion, why should anyone watch Romeo and Juliet or Richard III when everyone knows the tragedy of those stories? Even unusual tales, such as Get Shorty, do not reduce the value of simple stories portraying people with the kinds of problems many of us might face.
I also cannot understand how these characters should be labeled as unrealistic. They show depth, subtlety, and sensitivity. Perhaps the critic does not count such people among his acquaintances, but is a single mother with a sick child more or less realistic than a loan-shark enforcer and movie buff with a heart of gold? The latter is a great concept and fun to watch, but not everything must be fun, and how often has any of us seen a character like that?
As for Katherine Healey, I don't know what a lack of acting experience has to do with the quality of an acting performance, which was flawless, in my view. I have, however, noted that many performances portraying people with athletic or artistic skills have suffered greatly by the inability of actors to produce a creditable representation of training in those skilled areas. The young Ms. Healey's legitimate ballet skills added measurably to the quality of the film, as did her acting, though she was hired only after Tony Bill had been unable to find a trained actress with the requisite background in dance. (Similarly, Patrice Donnelly's performance in Personal Best was highly praised, Oscar worthy, and so much the better for her real-life credentials as an Olympic hurdler. She was originally hired to train her co-star Mariel Hemingway and was offered the controversial role after established actresses had declined to participate in this production from an Academy Award winner. One could hardly have imagined a more difficult beginning role, especially for a heterosexual woman, than a love story of lesbians. Patrice may have been snubbed by the Academy, but Time magazine's review of her work was an unreserved rave.)
Although I only happened to catch this beautiful film of Six Weeks late one night, I would rank it among the highest on my list and would recommend it to anyone with a heart.",1027296000,27,2406,4.94320987654321
692384,5,630358912X,"There are some movies that are timeless and priceless:  Gone with the Wind, Casablancaa and Six Weeks.  I first saw this movie in 1982- I was only 14 years old at the time. The movie was so moving and touching that I cried just thinking about it.  Even now to talk about it I cry.  I got married four years ago and I made my husband watch it.  He's a big tough guy and he even cried.  He loved it.  When we went back to rent it again, the rental place had sold it.  I've been searching everywhere to find a copy to purchase.  At last Amazon has afforded me such an honor.
This movie has comedy, drama, love, and suspense.  I will ever hold it dear to my heart.  No other movie can move you like this one.",984528000,18,704,3.9928057553956835
692385,3,630358912X,"Watching this film, I wanted to care about the characters, but found  myself unable to really do so.  The acting is credible; the story is good,  but it just seems to fall flat.  This should have been a tearjerker, but,  notwithstanding that I tend to be overly sentimental, I found myself  generally unmoved by the film; it lacked something.",968284800,2,342,4.711864406779661
692386,3,630358912X,"Part of what makes this movie so moving is the music. Dudley Moore not only starred in the movie, but he also composed the musical score. Six Weeks, although quite predictable, was very well acted and deserves its due  credit.",944524800,2,226,4.65
692509,4,630358912X,"I was so curious to see how this held up, or, er, if I'd changed.  I saw it when it came out, and LOVED it.  What a difference a few decades makes.  I still liked many things about it, though there are many improbable aspects, sheesh.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Dudley is running for Congress and yet he's seen all over town with an alternate family, billing and cooing and snuggling, and no-one notices?  Even so, I liked the notion of a relationship being forged on the basis of empathy/sympathy.  The chemistry between the three leads was palpable, believable, potent.  The dialogue was pretty good, clever.  I thought Dudley was spot on, sincere, believable, at his dramatic best (I still miss him).  Didn't get the sense of any gratuitous chain/tear-jerking going on.  Unlike other reviewers, I saw no evidence of actual adultery.  Far from being a cad, I thought Dudley's character was a good, loving man, wonderful.

What changed for me in the intervening years was my assessment of Mary Tyler Moore's performance.  I am a fan, have liked everything she's ever done (miss her too!) but her acting in several scenes made me wince (overacting in places, unconvincing in others).  I've never seen a less than sterling performance from her.  Other than that, I think this is affecting and bittersweet, and though not perfect, well worth watching- in fact, I rented it first and then purchased it.",1488067200,,1394,4.843220338983051
692510,5,630358912X,I loved this movie. The young woman is such a beautiful dancer and also a very good actress. I love Mary Tyler Moore. And Dudley Moore was a nice plus. I always thought he didn't get the respect he deserved as an actor.,1487203200,,219,4.116279069767442

Dudley Moore surprises with his winning turn as a politician. The young girl in the film is simply superb in every aspect.  I was moved to tears by the end. Six Weeks manages to still feel relevant today despite being made in the early 1980's.  Don't let a somewhat sad ending keep you from watching this film.  So much better than many of the movies made today.  Rich, realistic dialog carries the film. And, you can see here why Mary Tyler Moore won the Oscar for her role in Ordinary People.  She's a wonderful, subtle actress.  This is a superb little gem of a movie.",1485820800,2,702,4.568

One cannot expect complete coverage from the likes of David Muir or Katie Couric, so I went in on my own here. Yes, the story is more chimerical than real, but the art and philosophy in it is more than satisfying if you are female. The ballet sequence is beautiful. The ingenue who played the role of the dying dancer is poignant and humorous. Death is treated as more of a passage than a tragedy. I recommend revisiting this film if you have time.

She was also a figure skater, married to the much older skater and famous coach, Peter Burrows. I am sure having him for a husband helped her with jobs. Mary Tyler Moore who just passed away, stars as the dedicated, rich, and somewhat eery mother; a very serious and unusual role for her. Dudley Moore, whom I never liked, is the mixed up politician, trying to have two families. With connections, so typical and true in the music and arts world, he obtains an audition after the deadline for Healy and she winds up with a solo in the NYC Nutcracker ballet. You do not obtain employment in the arts without nepotism and connections--total reality. Finally the truth was placed in a film.",1485388800,4,825,4.619047619047619

692978,3,630358912X,"Blame it on youth, blame it on Reagan, but I remember this movie being a lot better in the 80s.

The premise is a little odd - SPOILER:

A precocious girl is dying, and one of her last wishes is to...wait for it...work on a political campaign. Her mother (a Jane Fonda aerobicized Mary Tyler Moore) is a cosmetics tycoon who like U.S. Bates in the Toy, will buy her kid anything she wants...including congressional candidate Dudley Moore.  Even though he is married, he moves in with them, and helps said dying girl fulfill some of her last wishes.

The best part of the movie for me are the scenes NYC in the 80s, and of course the amazing clothes.  Dudley Moore is charming as ever, and Mary Tyler Moore is great (and a foot taller than Dudley).

Trite, unbelievable characters:  the precocious Pollyanna-ish daughter, the strong but man-needy mother (was there any other kind of women in movies of that time?), the ""cheating"" father figure who seems to have no chemistry with either of his families - are we really supposed to feel sorry for him being torn in two directions?
It's hard to get past all the ridiculous events as well:  getting the terminally ill girl to audition and dance in the Nutcracker in New York city all in one day,  a dying child having no symptoms whatsoever for months and then sudden pain followed by immediate death, the perverse marriage ceremony with an already married man to appease the dying child.

693148,5,630358912X,"I love ballet and was the same age as Katherine Healy when the movie came out, and also a ballet dancer, so it was relatable to me. Watching it now, the Moores do seem like a bit of an odd couple, but I still enjoy their performances. Katherine Healy was fantastic. Obviously, she's a beautiful dancer, but what people refer to as an ""unpolished performance"" comes across as genuine to me. For those who accuse it of having the Movie Disease of the Week plot, you might be interested in knowing that Nicole Dreyfus was based on a girl that the author, Fred Mustard Stewart, met on an airplane who only had six weeks to live.",1420243200,2,624,4.387931034482759

693151,5,630358912X,"On par with so many movies that were made at this time it touches you where so much of life runs you down. When you think your life is so horrid someone else is losing a loved one to diseases we have yet to conquer. There is always a life lesson in everyday living some comical and others not so much. And those are the times we need movies like this, to move you when there is so little in life that does. I miss Dudley Moore he made watching his movies and listening to his music so enlightening. Thanks Dudley",1380499200,,512,4.079207920792079

Saw it was available on video on demand, and while it's only a rental (I would prefer to just buy it)I thought I'd give it a try.  Sound & video quality is not the greatest and at about 51 minutes into the film, it inexplicably repeats the last scene.  Hopefully amazon will figure a way to clean it up and fix it.

ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE WILL INEVITALLY BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES; IT WILL ALSO ROLL YOU WITH LAUGHTER.  THE REALITY OF WHAT LIFE SOMETIMES THROWS AT YOU SHOWS ITS HEAD IN THIS MOVIE.  THE LINE THAT ""PATRICK"" READS FROM NIKKIS LETTER STATING THAT ANYONE THAT IS SAD THINKING OF HER, NEVER REALLY NEW HER;  WILL STICK WITH ME FOREVER.

693156,4,630358912X,"I loved this movie as a young teen and want to see it again.  Although, it ALWAYS bothered me that he put his own wife and son off to the side to ""help"" this girl (which certainly was rewarding for him, too.  She was an inspiration.)

It could lend itself well to discussion, though.  In what ways was he (and his wife) true and supportive to his (her) own marriage/family?  How did each character make a difference for good in the lives of others?  Could those same things have been accomplished without putting one's family to the side?  (If so, how would that have been different?)  What, if any, things trump marriage and family responsibilities?  What would you do, if you were in his situation?  What did he do or say that could give his wife the perception that she was not his ""top choice""?  What precautions might have helped keep his marriage and family relationships stronger?

Thought-provoking dilemma.  That is the main thing that gives me pause in showing it to my own girls.",1239753600,5,990,4.588571428571429

It bothered me viewing the movie now; it did not when I was young?

Six Weeks is a ""nice"" story and well acted.  I will keep it in my movie library as it brings back the memories of the good old days.  It's hard to obtain a print of this movie which proves others enjoy it also.  Any fan of the two Moores or of Ms. Healy will thoroughly enjoy the movie.",1235865600,,627,4.140495867768595
7851793,1,630358912X,"This movie is just horrible.  I don't understand anybody liking this movie.  First - it is totally unrealistic.  Dudley Moore is supposed to be a politician and Mary Tyler Moore is supposed to be a very rich business owner with a sick daughter.  He leaves his wife and son for her and her daughter in the midst of his campaign.  Ummmmm - When does a politician who is running for office and appears IN MANY PUBLIC PLACES with a woman other than his own family get away with it?  You mean to tell me that the paparazzi wouldn't be following him around to catch any kind of dirt on him that they could?  Really? Whoever made this movie sugar coats everything as totally innocent, but it is just showing it's OK to leave your family if you are helping a sick child and her mother cope with the child's illness.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Dudley Moore is barely taller than the little girl and Mary Tyler Moore towers over him.  I didn't find this movie entertaining at all....Instead, I was sickened that they tried to make all of this acceptable under the guise of a child having cancer and we are supposed to embrace this as a feel-good movie with a sad ending.",1525824000,,1163,4.443396226415095
