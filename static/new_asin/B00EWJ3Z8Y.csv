8610083,4,B00EWJ3Z8Y,"I think people too often feel the filmmaker has control over how things play out in every aspect of a film, in a documentary film. If you are doing it right you don't.  This was a very well put together story, that gave the perspective of someone who was passionate about baseball and what it meant for him to share with others.  Conflict naturally happens when people can't see each others point of view, when cultural differences clash, when egos do get in the way.  The filmmakers did a good job of showing us the changes that occurred during this process and I felt made it authentic not forced into any certain direction.  We complain when storytellers make stuff happen in documentary work, when it isn't ""real"".  I feel this film takes a turn and becomes about this man and his dream, about how he wants something for others and then for himself, and really wants it to go a certain way.  It feels to me like the filmmaker let things happen and didn't try to create the story in their perspective but truly let the story form in front of them.  As a documentary filmmaker it is hard to get true reality happening in front of you simply because the camera being there changes the way people act, or react.  It would be interesting to get more of the teams perspective, but let the person it was about unfold in front of them.  I really thought it was a great story, well told, and really well edited together, beautifully filmed, and would recommend people watch it because it is a good example of documentary storytelling done well.",1456272000,,1539,4.5071942446043165

8610087,1,B00EWJ3Z8Y,"The movie became about the fight between coaches rather than the development of the players.  The players took a back seat to the drama between Joe Cook, who seemed to be a self-absorbed egotist, and the professional coaches that came from the United States to assist him.  In many ways Joe was verbally abusive to his players.  The Cambodian team was soundly trounced by every opponent.  It was more a documentary of failure than success.  I felt sorry for the Cambodian kids that made the effort to play; had they a better representative than Joe Cook they likely would have met with greater success.",1398124800,,602,4.75
8610088,3,B00EWJ3Z8Y,"I've been meaning to watch this film for awhile now, and have finally had a chance to do so. I've also had a chance to read some of the critical comments made from my fellow reviewers.

That being said this film depicts a man who seemingly wants to do right for birthplace, his country. He wants to bring America's great past time of baseball to Cambodia and in a sense, he achieves that goal. I have to agree with the individual stating that this documentary is a bit fragmented but one has to realize that this is just that, a documentary. It comes from one vantage point. As with many documentaries, the viewer wishes that more was included, more of the team (less of joe perhaps), more sentiment and reactions from players and what it means to them as a whole; you only get a glimpse of this.

After the movie, I went ahead and read Patrick Hruby's article ""Field of Schemes"" to get his take of Joe and furthermore read Joe's rebuttal from Khmerican.com. I feel as though Patrick has no intentions of painting Joe in a negative light but lays out all the facts on the table. Joe seems a bit 'wishy-washy' in his Khmerican interview.

**Spoiler alert.
However, in response to the person stating that the film director was trying to cover up Joe's negative actions and how he acted as a dictator, I believe this wasn't so. The filmmaker provides a pivotal moment where Joe bashes the team the fires the foreign coaches. It was a rude awakening. This shows what kind of man Joe is.

Maybe Joe doesn't know a lick about baseball and pockets donations but coaches change and so do players. I hope the Cambodian national team gets an understanding coach and one that can lead the team in a better direction but this is a start.",1390867200,,1725,4.484076433121019
8610089,1,B00EWJ3Z8Y,"After watching the movie, and in light of reading the ESPN article about Joe Cook and baseball in Cambodia [...], I find that the film is mostly trying to cover up for all the negative things that Joe Cook is doing. (Read the ESPN article if you want to know what I'm referring to). But before I get into that I'll write a brief review of the movie. I think it lacked a central voice and a central story. It started with a narration from the director, which led me to believe that it was going to be told from his point of view. Then it switched gears into talking about Joe Cook, baseball in Cambodia, stories of some of the players, and then back to Joe Cook's despotic authority over the team and its operations. I'm not sure where the film was heading. It seem fragmented.

As for the story of Joe Cook and his unscrupulous acts, I was tipped off by a film maker I met who was working on the film with Daron Ker. He had some footage that was shot but was never released. Let's just say the story of Joe Cook bring baseball to Cambodia is great, but it goes much much deeper than that. Joe Cook uses his position as a Cambodian American from America to pose as a big shot in the town of Baribo and does whatever he wants. The villagers don't know that he practically begs and steals to provide the basics for the baseball team, but as the ESPN articles points out, the team should have a lot more than what Joe Cook has taken in. He enjoys the power he wields in the village. Why else would he absolutely ignore the advice of MLB Asia and a Cambodian tycoon who wants to put baseball in Cambodia in a big city to attract better players and competition. He doesn't want to get exposed.",1356566400,2,1687,4.222910216718266
8610090,1,B00EWJ3Z8Y,"i appreciate the cook but I didn't like the way he handled the situation. i think the documentary was premature. Baseball is a generational sport. It should be looked at as a long term improvement  not an over night sensation. Overall I am disappointed.  I walked away offended and insulted. I am Cambodian and I felt shameful to have watch this with my family and friends. Please do our people the favor and show how the players enjoy  the game instead of the coaches and cook bad talking each other.  This documentary should be a team improvement but it was more like one man's perspective on how he ""FELT"" he was wronged and how he should make it right. Anyhow I think the cook jump the gun and made a mess. This documentary should have never been made in this way.",1348963200,,768,4.425531914893617
