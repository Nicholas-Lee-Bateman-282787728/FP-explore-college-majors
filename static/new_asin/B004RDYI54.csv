8439027,3,B004RDYI54,"This dvd was different from the onset; 1. Started out in foreign tongue, which I presume to be Thai. I managed to change audio to English; 2. I was NOT able to view it Full Screen, which is quite disheartening. I like to watch my movies in full screen mode and this aspect was lacking with this dvd; I MUST check , henceforth, to make certain that the dvd I purchase is NOT being sent from some other country due to these shortcomings. Movie did play well, however, was not quite as enjoyable since could not get it full-screen.",1398556800,,528,4.343434343434343
