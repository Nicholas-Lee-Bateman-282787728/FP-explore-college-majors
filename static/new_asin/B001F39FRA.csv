Remember those little bracelets:  WWJD? Well, the Ordinary Radicals do WJWD and they want to inspire the rest of us to follow suit!",1273449600,,279,5.177777777777778
8300875,5,B001F39FRA,"The Ordinary Radicals captures the progressive expression of a movement of mercy that is leaving a fistprint on a culture in transition. Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw continue to raise the standard of healthy rebellion, with a humility that eases the tension of anyone who might disagree.

Their story is told in provocative clarity, introducing us to new friends along the journey toward hope. Who wouldn't want to be a part of this? And from my time spent with these guys, I know there is always room at their table for anyone who is hungry for Truth.

8300876,3,B001F39FRA,"I enjoyed this documentary and wish the team the best. The cinematography is excellent, but I'm only giving it three stars because it's billed as a story of ordinary radicals, but really it felt more like a bunch of clips from the Jesus for President book tour. I loved each section individually but I don't think it comes together as a story and it is definitely focused on Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw. Others around the country make sort of cameo appearances, including Ron Sider, Brandt Russo, Brian McLaren, and Sr. Margaret McKenna. I loved hearing them speak but it was always too short before we're whisked away to the next book tour stop. If you want a really powerfully told story of one person with new old ideas about being a follower of Christ, I recommend ""One Punk Under God"".",1240272000,4,792,4.624113475177305
8300877,5,B001F39FRA,"After watching this film, reading Jesus for President and The Irresistible Revolution...my faith in Christ has been renewed, its been going on for awhile for this film and the stories and lives it presents give me new hope, new energy, and new eyes to begin to see a new way of following Christ, of putting my faith into action in ways that bring new life to people around me. I watched the film with about 50 students from the Wesley Foundation at Auburn University and we're spending the next four weeks discussing faith and politics...im very excited about the conversations that have already begun as a result of watching this film. Great job",1223596800,4,646,4.725663716814159
8300878,5,B001F39FRA,"This past Sunday we hosted the premiere of the new documentary film by Jamie Moffett ""The Ordinary Radicals"".  The movie includes a cornucopia of progressive Christians, Jim Wallis, Tony Campolo, Brian McClaren, Lisa Sharon Harper, and others.  The film chronicles Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, authors of ""Jesus For President"" as they travel across America and Canada (yes, up there they marked up the poster to read ""Jesus For Prime Minister) on an 11,000-mile tour promoting the book.
Jamie Moffett, the director and on-screen narrator / choragus, is a co-founder of The Simple Way community in North Philadelphia along with Shane Claiborne.  Jamie does not identify himself as a `Christian'. He considers himself a ""Recovering Catholic"" Agnostic, where he ""knows that he doesn't know, but is interested in learning from people who do, whose disillusionment was spurred in large part by the decision of Bishop Bevilacqua to evict and arrest a community of poor people who had been living in a long abandoned Catholic church in North Philadelphia.  There are powerful images of this event in the film.  Those who think this movie would be just another Christian propaganda film will be surprised.  Jamie does a great job of being an observer, and letting the people and their stories tell themselves.
One item that is handled with haunting adroitness is the story of the Laramie, Wyoming murder of a young gay man, whose life and tragic end spurred the theatre department at Eastern University in Pennsylvania to produce a play on the event.  The theatre professor shares his challenges in producing and casting the play.  The campus newspaper staff shares their experience in writing about the issues; the stories of gay members of the campus community and the vandalism and hate speech graffiti of the campus newspaper offices.  The film tells the story, but does not lead you to a conclusion.
For the most part, the `Ordinary Radicals' encountered on the tour, are just people living out their lives, in a manner that they feel they have been lead by God to do.  There are people of all backgrounds and ethnicities and socio-economic strata's.  There are people of many different faith traditions and no faith traditions at all, there are conservatives, liberals, and anarchists, men wearing ties and men wearing nose rings and tribal facial painting. The ""Jesus for President"" used French fry oil burning bus, is driven by Jay Beck, a pierced giant who looks like he could be Rubeus Hagrid's cousin from Harry Potter. Jamie's lens treats them all with equal respect.
The cinematography is awesome.  The vistas and people encountered in this travelogue are truly unique.  The music accompanying the film, including such artists as mewithoutYou and Psalters is powerful, as are the onscreen performances that were recorded as part of the tour.
Jamie and I were talking about the upcoming Bill Maher movie `Religulous"" and noting they are both films by documentary filmmakers who do not identify themselves as Christians, looking at Christians in action.  We both like Bill Maher and are looking forward to his `snarky' ironic intelligent humorous perspective.  We wondered however what Maher's film would look like, if he had the opportunity to focus on the same `ordinary radicals' segment of the Christian community he did.
I consider ""The Ordinary Radicals"" a must see film for anyone seeking to learn more about the great awakening emerging in the church today.",1222300800,3,3470,5.095238095238095
