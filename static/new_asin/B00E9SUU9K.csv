5899389,1,B00E9SUU9K,"I was unaware that the electronic formatting of the movies would be different than what we use on products built for the USA customer base. The seller claims this is clearly stated 'inside' the secondary link (who goes there?) of product details. Either way, it would not play on my USA DVD player. Strike one. So,I put it in a laptop, connected it to the TV via HDMI and it recognized and accepted Region 2 and began to lay the movie - except; as soon as chose the language and pressed the final play the movie button, the DVD did something that completely corrupted the graphics card on my laptop. It literally destroyed the graphics display, and now I have to get it repaired.  The company will refund my money but wants their product back (ok) free of marks, scratches, and finger prints (finger prints?)....I assume they will try and sell it to another unsuspecting buyer.

So I would never use this company again for anything.",1432339200,5,932,4.608433734939759

8603035,1,B00E9SUU9K,"Who reads the features and details on a DVD purchase? Saw it in the theater, great movie, thought it would be a nice end-of-school-year treat for my son. ""This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV."" It should read ""This seller needs a moral compass and some business sense."" Maybe I'm being too hash, Oxfordshire politely offered to let me return this item *if* it has not been removed from it's original packaging. Right, because I got the psychic message that it wouldn't play BEFORE opening? I'm just happy I read the other reviews before trying it in my computer!
