8285253,1,B001BXTORA,"If you are looking for ridiculous stereotypes, laughable melodrama, and terrible acting, this is your movie!  I'm a rowing fan and a friend of several of the people depicted in this movie, and and all I can say is ""Don't waste your time with this.""  It is based on David Halberstam's book The Amateurs but any similarities to that fine account of the 1984 Olympic rowing trials are wasted here.  It might be worth a laugh, but it's hard to make it through the whole film.  Could be a great midnight boathouse fest.",1401926400,,514,4.494623655913978
