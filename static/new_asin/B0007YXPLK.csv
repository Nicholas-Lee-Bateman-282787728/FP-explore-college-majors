2253241,5,B0007YXPLK,I watched this show when it used to come on channel13 back in 89 and I love it then and still do now. I been watching the episodes from my kindle or Iphone for free with my prime memebership almost everynight and I am up to season 3. This was a very great show it covered almost every topic in the world  from teen age pregnacy to bullying. Im so glad its also out on dvd too. A must watch show for teens and parents.,1392940800,,417,3.9058823529411764
2253242,4,B0007YXPLK,I love the drama degrassi always brings. Even for back in the day the drama is pretty shocking for the tv shows of the 80's,1389139200,,123,3.96

2253246,4,B0007YXPLK,"Everyone's favourite angst-ridden teens finally come to DVD in DEGRASSI JUNIOR HIGH.

All 13 episodes of the acclaimed second season are featured in this set. The series was a bold spinoff from the short-lived afterschool series THE KIDS OF DEGRASSI STREET, and was groundbreaking in that it approached topics like peer pressure, teen violence, suicide, sex and pregnancy with well-written and intelligent storylines. This series remains, many years later, quality television for the pre-teens and teens sets (adults will appreciate the writing and amazing acting from the talented cast), and stands up well to repeat screenings.

Season Two picks up the pieces from the stories of the previous year.  Taking precedence though is the plight of pregnant Spike (Amanda Stepto) and the future of her impending baby.  Stephanie Kaye (Nicole Stoffman), still recovering from her disastrous first term as School President, vows to clean up her act, and the antics of the one and only Joey Jeremiah (Pat Mastroianni) almost always land him in trouble.

Includes the following episodes:

""Eggbert"" - As part of a counselling experiment, Spike must carry an egg around for two weeks and treat it just like a real baby.  The new boy in Grade Eight, Simon (Michael Carry) captures the attention of both Alexa (Irene Courakos) and Stephanie.

""A Helping Hand"" - Substitute teacher Mr Colby begins to make unwanted advances toward Lucy (Anais Granofsky).

""Stagefright"" - Caitlin (Stacie Mistysyn) returns to school, but doesn't tell her friends that she has been diagnosed as an epileptic.  When she suffers a seizure during a slumber party, the story spreads around school that Caitlin is a `freak'.  Meanwhile, shy Michelle (Maureen McKay) has to give a speech.

""Great Expectations"" - The new girl, Liz (Cathy Keenan) becomes Joey's school partner.

""Fight!"" - Joey gets into a fight with school bully Dwayne (Darrin Brown) and the Stephanie-Simon-Alexa love triangle finally comes to a conclusion.

""Bottled Up"" - Kathleen's (Rebecca Haines) secret is finally blown when the school's quiz team holds a practice at her house, and everyone witnesses Katheen's alcoholic and abusive mother.

""Sealed With a Kiss"" - Erica (Angela Deiseach) dates a boy who loves to French-kiss...and later proves it again by smooching Heather (Maureen Deiseach).  But later, both Erica and Heather  complain of horrible laryngitis....could the boy have given them mono?

""Dinner and a Show"" - The future of Spike and Shane's (Bill Parrott) baby is discussed by both families.

""Dog Days"" - Stephanie is plagued by dreams of suicide and depressive moods when her mother announces plans to get married again.

""Censored"" - When Spike's pregnancy becomes common knowledge around town, the Parents Committee decide to exclude her from school.

""Trust Me"" - A harmless sleepover turns into a nightmare of epic proportions for Joey, Wheels (Neil Hope) and Snake (Stefan Brogren).

""He's Back..."" - Mr Colby is back, but this time starts taking an interest in Susie (Sarah Charlesworth).  Will Lucy finally report him for abuse?

""Pass Tense!"" - The Eighth Grade sit for their graduation exams, but news leaks through that the school will be incorporating the 9th Grade next year.  Nevertheless, the students enjoy a well-deserved graduation dance before Spike's labour begins.

A top season which sets the scene for the third and final year of `Junior High'.",1139529600,2,3423,5.2234432234432235
2253247,5,B0007YXPLK,"My 12 year old sister who lives in the United States watches the New Generation of Degrassi, whereas I came of age in Toronto watching the first generation of Degrassi kids.  I mentioned this old generation to her, describing the various characters and she absolutely wanted to see it!  I purchased the first season DVDs of the old generation for her and she ate them up!!  She is now 13 and I have purchased the second Season for her as she started the 8th grade.  Again, she absolutely loves watching the shows!  I find it strange that she would be drawn to these old style shows... the old hair, clothes, styles.... but she loves them as much as I did then.  It just goes to prove what a great show that was and how the lessons never fade.",1127606400,,742,4.340579710144928
2253248,5,B0007YXPLK,"The first season of ""Degrassi Junior High"" often came very close to feeling like public access, with a miniscule (at best) budget and often very wooden/weird acting.  It is truly a guilty pleasure. However, the show *did* portray everyday tween/teenager problems in a realistic, if sometimes heavy-handed, way. And tho the viewer feels like they're watching something from a movie that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" would be lampooning at times, the messages of ""Degrassi Junior High"" resonate much, much more than nearly any other high school-set series (""Feaks and Geeks"" is at the top of that list).

From a technical standpoint, Season Two is a big improvement.  New topics that are tackled include depression, divorce/remarriage, and sex.  The teen actors clearly developed their talents and come off more believable as they did in Season 1.  The camerawork and direction have also improved.  From a guilty pleasure standpoint, you STILL will love watching these episodes with dated music, clothes, and hairstyles a plenty.  The DVD set comes with teaching supplements that would be helpful for any jr.high/hs teachers that are thinking of showing episodes in class. I give this series an A+ for having its heart in the right place and not talking down to its audience.  Other features include the ""Degressi Talks...on Depression"" special, which is actually quite moving.

Like the first season collection, you can't go wrong with this DVD. You'll appreciate its honest portrayal of 12-15 year olds, but find much to laugh at in terms of the production values and overall 80s nostalgia. Glad Season 3 is just around the corner!",1123459200,,1633,5.15530303030303
2253249,5,B0007YXPLK,Season 2 was great. In the first episode Spike and Shane have to take care of an egg. Also Steph gets rid of the clothes and gives them to Alexa who gains the attention of Simon the cute new boy or though later we find out Simon liked Alexa for her and not for the clothes because Steph started wearing them again after Alexa's mother grounded her for wearing them and Simon stayed with Alexa. Even though Stephanie want him she spend the first couple of episodes trying to win Simon over. She spend the entire second season whinging weather it was about not getting Simon or the fact that her father wanted custody or that her mother had a boyfriend. The second episode was good Lucy put her trust in a teacher Mr. Colby and he touched her and she felt unconfortable. Caitlin found out she had epilepsy. Wheels parents got strict. Joey was committed to the Zit Remedy. Melanie went on a date with Snake. Kathleen battled with an alcholic mother. Spike and Shane dealt with the pressures and consequences of becoming teen parents. In Australia the DVD cover is different it has Steph on it. There are no specials features but I got a free Degrassi Badge with my DVD with is cool. Also we have 2 discs instead of 3.,1122854400,,1214,4.424107142857143

2253256,5,B0007YXPLK,The series is entertaining and features characters who are easy to relate to. The series deals with issues that most of us can identify with at one time or another during our teenage years.,1441152000,,189,4.588235294117647
2253257,5,B0007YXPLK,Can't get enough of this show!,1440979200,,30,4.166666666666667
2253258,5,B0007YXPLK,"Degrassi Junior High is what I'd call an evergreen TV show. I watched this as a teen with my siblings and though decades have since passed, my love for this show remains strong. I have been viewing this with my fifth-grader and discussing some of the issues dealt with on the show. In this second season (btw, I do recommend this show be watched in sequence, i.e. the first season, followed by the second and third), the characters continue to grow and evolve. 14-year-old Spike, who discovered she was pregnant in the last season faces some tremendous challenges: her ex Shane has still not told his parents about her pregnancy, Spike later faces possible expulsion from the school, and amidst all this are two young teens trying very hard to deal with the repercussions of their actions.

Other tough subjects are also tackled here: Kathleen, who is the typical straight-laced high achiever hides the secret that her mother is an alcoholic;  seventh-grader Arthur worries he is a sex pervert when he keeps having recurrent wet dreams; Caitlin finds it a struggle to hide her epilepsy from her friends; and, in one of the most disturbing episodes, lonely and neglected Lucy, whose parents are too busy to be real parents, finds herself the victim of a predatory monster. This episode enabled my daughter and I to have a frank and meaningful discussion about how to handle such situations and what should be done should something like this crop up. As difficult as it was to watch this episode and talk about it later, it proved to be very rewarding. This is what I love about this show: it enables honest and meaningful conversations to be had around what can prove to be extremely unpalatable topics. Highly recommended.",1439078400,,1722,4.8141891891891895

2253269,4,B0007YXPLK,"OK, I'll bite on the whole review gambit.

I've noticed that several reviewers have made derogatory remarks about the ""actors"".

Maybe I missed something, but I thought it was more ""Role Play"" than acting????

2253272,5,B0007YXPLK,I have a 10 year old who will be entering middle school next year and this series deals with trials and tribulations a young girl or boy will encounter when they get there. The show also shows how young people should handle these situations and the consequences of their mistakes. I recommend you sit down and watch the series with your child and be ready to answer their questions. You will have less worries in the future.,1404000000,,424,4.51948051948052
2253273,5,B0007YXPLK,"I grew up with Degrassi Jr. High on PBS when I was IN Jr. High at the time it was awesome. Degrassi always hits real issues hard. Recommended for everyone, but especially those living with and raising children, it would be a helpful tool in realizing what kids are actually going through and how to communicate effectively with them. It's a shame people poke fun at Degrass! Yes, I know it's cheese, but who doesn't love cheese???",1402358400,,430,4.597402597402597

2253276,5,B0007YXPLK,"Unlike Degrassi: the Next Generation, Degrassi Junior High told kids, teens, and adults what they needed to know and hear. Not all the typical ""90210 lovey-dovey stuff"". Season 1 was just a start; season 2 is where it starts getting interesting--as coming of age does in real life. Plus, the social climbers are not mean for nothing; there's a story behind it all. And the cast and writers know that well and good.

Recommended to pre-teen, teen, and post-teen viewers, especially those of today. Young at heart? They can watch and learn too. A lot of adults forget they were kids themselves.

Far beyond anything Glee, The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Switched at Birth, or other patronizing convenience-driven shows of the past ten or so years can dish up.",1397692800,,767,4.847328244274809

8054277,5,B0007YXPLK,"I got caught up in this show on one of the PBS stations when I was a teenager years ago, and it was the best thing to watch on Saturday evenings. So I was very excited to see that all seasons of this show were on Amazon Video. I was looking forward to binge watching all of the Degrassi shows, including Degrassi High, and Degrassi the Next Generation. I got halfway through Season 2 one Sunday afternoon last month, only to discover I could no longer watch the show for free (with the Prime subscription anyway). I couldn't believe they cut it off like they did and wanted me to either buy or rent the show to watch it. I never knew Amazon Video only gave you access to watch certain shows for a certain period of time. It's been on my Watchlist for months, and I had just gotten around to watching it. There were so many things that I had forgotten about with this show and to say that I am disappointed that I can no longer view it unless I pay for it, is an understatement. This is a really great show, especially for pre-teens and teenagers. They tackled a lot of issues, including teen pregnancy, drug use, abuse, and alcoholism. Amazon, this show should always be free, instead of available to rent or buy.",1472601600,,1213,4.324561403508772
