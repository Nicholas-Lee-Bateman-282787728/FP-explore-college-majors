6898382,4,B00R3MU8XM,"This 2012 Hallmark Channel movie is based on Lisa Kleypas' book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-Eve-at-Friday-Harbor/dp/0312605870/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas Eve at Friday Harbor</a>. And based on how much I liked the movie, I may have to get the book. In holiday movies, it's almost not fair when the script calls on that plot device about the devastated child who's stopped talking. It's so poignant it can't help but lure you in, you old softie. I just hours ago watched another holiday movie -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Season-For-Miracles-Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame/dp/B0002I7ZYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Season For Miracles (Hallmark Hall of Fame)</a>&nbsp;(1999) - with a similar plot device, except that seeing that same old chestnut so soon again doesn't lessen the impact. And now you feel bad for both kids.

CHRISTMAS WITH HOLLY starts out in Seattle, Washington but soon enough relocates to Friday Harbor, a hamlet on an island that comes off as so pleasing visually and so welcoming that you promptly dismiss any notion of a sad ending. I wouldn't at all mind living in Friday Harbor. Especially since it features fun establishments like the T.A.N. Coffee shop (T.A.N. = The Alternative Network) and the Magic Mirror Toy Shop. Which brings us to their respective proprietors.

The plot concerns a coffee shop owner who's become guardian to his orphaned, six-year-old niece. Mark Nagle (Sean Faris) is struggling to connect with the traumatized Holly (Josie & Lucy Gallina). Holly hasn't spoken since her mom died three months back. Her school administrator is mighty worried about Holly and implores Mark to impose psychological counseling for her. Mark instead opts to take a ferry ride out of Seattle and back to his island home of Friday Harbor. Seattle had always been more his dearly departed sister's cup of tea.

The third most important character in our story is Maggie Conway (Eloise Mumford, awesome name!) whose heart gets shattered when she's left at the altar (actually, it never even gets as far as the altar; dude never even shows up in church). If Maggie moped much, she did it off-camera. We catch up with Maggie again as she follows her dream of opening a toy store in Friday Harbor. She opens it just before Christmas. We learn that Maggie has got proper backbone when she fires that store manager what thinks she knows how to run Maggie's toy store better than Maggie. Set her straight, Maggie, she's not the boss of you.

In Friday Harbor the fun family dysfunction kicks into full gear as Holly makes a new home with Mark and his two brothers, macho uber-handyman Scott (Dana Watkins) and nerdy, oddball scientist Alex (Daniel Eric Gold). A huge sub-plot concerns how this new household comes together. Juxtaposing that sub-plot is a minor one about whether Maggie ends up keeping that damn cute basset hound, Olive. An even more minor thread revolves around whether Mark keeps his out-of-the-loop girlfriend Shelby (Alex Paxton-Beesley). The answer to that was in the wind from jump. Poor Shelby - I actually feel bad for her - wasn't going to get thru to Holly. We all knew that that was reserved for Maggie and her toy shop which is right across the street from Mark's caf and the awesome fairy doll house that's the center piece of the toy shop. Plus, Maggie can Riverdance. How do you not root for a girl who can do that?

CHRISTMAS WITH HOLLY targets them hopeless romantics (that's you and me, man). The characters engage you and are quirky. Identical twins Lucy and Josie Gallina are adorable as Holly. Maybe it's astute acting, and maybe it's just the premise of the non-speaking child, but Lucy and Josie as Holly evoke immediate sympathy and pangs of heartbreak. There's something about them. The narrative connives to place obstacles between Mark and Maggie's getting together, but it's not fooling anyone. I know you're an easy touch right now, because the holiday season's just around the corner. Let me say that CHRISTMAS WITH HOLLY works on a lot of levels. The cast is good. The story is sentimental but not treacly. There's an old-fashioned warmth here and a laugh or three and nothing objectionable. In scenic Friday Harbor, time is lavished on neglected basset hounds and on Riverdancing. I say, ""Sold, American!""",1420934400,17,4382,5.21875

The Synopsis:

Now normally I don't often give the full story (or close to in this case as Im sure Ive left out a lot.) But I need to in order to help compare it to the book. So some SPOILERS. Although its a Hallmark movie, so its predictable.

Maggies been ditched at the alter, and then moves to an island by Seatle, Washington. She starts up a toy store and has a fairy house. Mark Nolan, youngest of 4, owns a coffee shop on the island. His sister dies tragically, and Mark becomes the guardian of his niece Holly, who hasn't spoken since the tragedy. Mark and Maggie meet on the ferry ride to the island. But they hardly get a chance to talk. Oh and Mark has a girlfriend. Mark and Holly moves in to the older brother, Scotts house that is being renovated, where the other brother,  Alex the scientist, lives too.

Marks girlfriend tries to persuade Mark to move to Seatle. But Marks life is focused just on Holly now. He breaks up with her after a a dinner party with friends, because she doesnt understand how much Holly means to Mark.

Mark tries to give Holly the perfect Nolan Thanksgiving dinner, but the guys all fail at cooking. Dinner is ruined. Mark meets Maggie while he was walking to reflect, and she was going for a run. They talk and then go on their separate ways.

Holly starts school at the island, and shes still not talking  6 months since her mom died. Holly and Mark then visit Maggies toy store twice. And Holly is still not talking. But she does write down a grocery list for the guys to get her.

Then one day, Mark brings Holly to his coffee shop, and they are swamped with customers, so he cant keep a full eye on Holly. And she makes a break for it at Maggies store. Holly tells Maggie the name of the fairy that lives in the house is Victoria, which is Hollys Moms name too. She talks, after 7 or so months later. They go home and the guys ask her who her favorite uncle is, and Holly says its Alex. He is a cool uncle, even though he studies fungus, or is it marine life?

Christmas comes and Holly has written a letter to Santa, asking for a Mom. And it just so happens that Mark and Maggie might become more than friends.

My Thoughts:

I have lost count to how many times Ive seen this. Its a good Hallmark movie. It seems to focus more on Holly and the island, than the romance between Mark and Maggie. Like this photo with the boats, showing the town almost has me wanting to live on an island like that. But as my Grandpa said when they first showed the island, one hurricane and that island will get flooded with water.""

My only criticism is I felt that the ending didn't flow from one scene to the other. First, they are all watching this boat show and it seems like it could be the ending. But wait! Oops. They forgot the Christmas dinner, and Maggie needs to give Holly the fairy house. And the entire house needs to be lit up with Christmas lights. The entire house! Even the construction scaffolding at the side. It looks nice, even if parts of it looks CGI.",1452729600,5,3116,4.259322033898305
