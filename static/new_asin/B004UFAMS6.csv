8441481,4,B004UFAMS6,"Season 1 - Very inventive series, which  morphs somewhat along the way during it's first 6 episode season.
A vampire. a  werewolf and a ghost all share a small house in England.  They desperately want to simply fit
in, be accepted and not hurt anyone.  It's got a lot of dry wit and some real emotions as well, with strong
performances throughout.  Someone remarked it's like `Seinfeld' with undead characters, and that is part
of the appeal early on, seeing these characters more in human, often humorous ways than in scary supernatural
ones.  But over the course of the season, the supernatural and darker tones become more and more prominent.
This leads to some confusion in tone at times, along with some messiness as to just what the rules of the game
are for these creatures.  There's also a few hard to take leaps of faith (e.g. a human character who hardly seems
fazed when he leans the true identity of our three leads.).  When it first turned from `dramedy' to drama, and
the supernatural elements began to grow stronger I was very disappointed, as it seemed like the show was losing
what made it unique, but then it regained it's balance by amping up the emotions along with the other-worldly,
and making the characters' pain at being trapped between worlds, and their love for each other moving and real,
while avoiding (mostly) clichs or the familiar.  I'll be very curious to see where it goes from here.

Season 2 -  While still uneven at times, with it's goofy moments of humor not always meshing smoothly with it's darker
and more emotional sides, the series has grown a bit in it's 2nd season.  While still not (for me) up with the all time great
series like The Wire or Mad Men or Breaking Bad, at it's best, it's an amazingly potent mix of heartrending drama, dark,
off-beat humor and some effective horror as well.  But this is horror with all the rules reversed, with the `monsters' being
the human race, and the heroes our vampire werewolf and ghost who simply want to live like other people.  At times, in
an odd way it reminded me of ""Dexter"", the outsider with scary possibilities, who wants to fit in.  But whereas Dexter
is all about emotions repressed, here the emotions are on the sleeve (occasionally a bit too much, and there are a few
soapy moments).

Much like the first season this starts strong, seems to lose its way a bit in the middle, with some forced humor, and
repetitive moments but finishes with such a kick that its easy to forgive any lapses.  The acting is on a very high level,
the writing is witty and human, and the direction and camerawork can be very effective at creating mood and scares
on a TV budget.  Not perfect perhaps, but it's a rare TV show that can make me think, laugh, cry, and send a shiver
down my spine all in one episode.  Some great use of rock tunes to set the mood tops it off.

Season 3 -  I seem to be in the minority, but for me season 3 represented a bit of frustrating fall off from the preceding years,
although it still has it's share of strong moments, and the last 2 episodes are very powerful. But some of the earlier weaknesses
have gotten more prevalent; twists that seem a bit arbitrary, rules of its world that seem to shift to fit story convenience, story
lines that get dropped, character choices and complex morality that aren't really explored or are over-simplified, episodes that
seem a bit disconnected from the others.

And some of the strengths are less played too; fewer ironic or emotional uses of rock music, fewer visually inventive scenes,
and most importantly, less genuine emotion, and more slightly histrionic soapy-ness. (Suddenly the characters seem to
cry in every episode, which starts to make those powerful moments lose their impact). And the questions of 'what are good
and evil in a complex world' seem to be less deeply explored than before.  (There's tremendous room to explore 'what is guilt'
'what is mercy' and 'what is evil' in this particular season, and in the end the answers given seem a bit too neat.)

There are also episodes in the middle that feel a bit dull, as if treading water. Perhaps this season would have been stronger
as 5 or 6 episodes.

Certainly good television, and worth watching, but for the first time I found myself less emotionally moved, and more apt to
find my mind wandering. The climax (which in some ways feels like a natural ending to the series) certainly makes up for a
lot of that, but not all of it.",1356998400,,4452,4.576826196473552
8441482,5,B004UFAMS6,"This series has a lot of humor, action and great characters. It is very different from the American vampire series, but I simply love it :)",1353196800,,139,4.384615384615385
8441483,5,B004UFAMS6,"The first three seasons of this series are very interesting. Though they are centered on three main characters, some are added in the most opportunistic ways and some are eliminated in the most tragic and dramatic ways. That's fascinating. But then some are destroyed and yet they can come back with some miracle, or some twisting of some rule or even rules. There is no gospel - and certainly no Bible - of monsters in this series. And yet...

The vampires are seen as nothing but killers and no matter how hard they try to be human and integrate society they have to kill to survive by feeding and no one can survive without feeding. So they have to kill humans or use humans as bleeding cows, which is not that easy to achieve. The second solution was tried by Stephen King but it did not lead too far. The series does not try the solution brought up by Anne Rice, feeding on corrupted and perverted criminals and human beings. The series does not try at all to introduce any dimension of morality in the vampires. They can play at being human but they cannot be in any way human.

The werewolves get a better lot because they are not eternal and they have kept some of their human qualities which are experimented here like getting pregnant because they are animals but living animals and hence can have a reproductive procedure of their own. What happens when a female werewolf is impregnated by a male werewolf on a full moon night? Gritty and stupendous voyeurism, isn't it? But this animal dimension enables these werewolves to retain some humanity, including the moral dimension of love. They can really love and that love may redeems them. But once again Anne Rice's very recent solution is not worked on at all: once again attacking only evil human beings and changing at will and when necessary.

The series brings that love between George and Nina to the procreative level, which is very physical indeed. But it also brings that love this time between George Sands and John Mitchell to a real peak of intensity and power. Two men - even if they are not men - can love each other so strongly and deeply that they cannot kill each other because of their love and yet so strongly and deeply that they can kill each other for the very same reason, because of their love. This twist in the series is not gay because it is in no way sexual, but it is fully gay in a way because that love is real love and gay love is love between two men or males and it does not have to be sexual. We are living in a world that is finally understanding that love is the most intense passion of humanity and that it has little to do with sexual realization, though it can lead to that sexual realization if such is the sexual orientation of the concerned subjects, an orientation that is sexual as indicated by its very name and thus has little to do with the mental and spiritual relation between the two concerned males, with the mental and spiritual orientation or passion two males or men can experience.

The third type of beings is ghosts and particularly Annie. But she is a fool and appears like that all the time, making tea but not drinking it, loving a vampire and wanting to reform him by having him punished by human justice, meddling all the time with the life of the people she loves or who are her friends and with human society in general. She is always misguided and manipulated by events and other ghosts and she is unable to protect those she loves, to reform those she loves and even to really love those she loves since she has them destroyed in the end, or rejected. Don't try to be a ghost in this life, you will end up in the gutter of human society.

Then the story is hyper messy and at times difficult to follow because it is opportunistic and we do not always see a simple and single line in the plot and in the various characters, though there should be since it is a mini-series and not an American series like ""Supernatural"". Too many of them are resuscitated, regenerated, recuperated and too many are wasted, destroyed and lost forever with absolutely no logic in it. But the series is superb as for its main male characters, John Mitchell, George Sands and Tom McNair, not to speak of Herrick whatever his name may be. But I must admit the female characters are rather weak. Finally some peripeteias are simply un-needed, like the turning of a dead child into a vampire by John Mitchell for the sake of the child's mother though the child will never come back into the picture in the three seasons. What a waste of vampire material!

In one word these monsters are trying to be human but around them the human characters are extremely weak if not systematically under-graded if not de-graded. The human society is purely circumstantial and thus evanescent and uninteresting. But what an interesting cheese fest with the male monsters!
