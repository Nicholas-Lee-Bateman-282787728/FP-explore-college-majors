2383643,2,B000AAF1UE,"One of my major peeves about ""Baby Galieo: Things in the Sky"" was the lack of the most common sky site, the airplane.  ""Baby Einstein: On the Go"" makes up for that.

The puppets and animation were typical BE.  The use of the song, ""Wheels of the Bus"", was very good, espically the hand motions the kids used to sing along.  My 2.5 year son loves it.  I like the way they tie different vehicles into Land, Sea, and Air.  Also, I finally saw a couple of toys in a BE video that my toddler actually owned, which he loved to see on the screen.

At first I didn't like the multitude of ""things"".  How often would this kid see a sailboard in real life?  Then it hit me:  that's the point.  Not living near a coast, I could not point out the differences very often.  Its a struggle, but after seeing this video a few times he realizes not everything in the air is an ""airplane"", there are some ""helicopters"".  I'm sure if we saw more boats he'd start to point out the difference between ""sailboat"" and ""canoe"".

The main problem I have is the audio quality (VHS version).  When the volume level is just right for the music, the speach comes in too loud and scratchy.  Turn down the volume to a proper speach level, and the music barely registers.  This is VERY POOR WORKMANSHIP for a professional editing company and is the only reason I gave this video such a low rating.  Correct that fault, and I would have given this video a 4-5.",1137974400,4,1427,4.280898876404494
2383644,5,B000AAF1UE,"This is a really great DVD, by far one of the best.  The first Einstein movies are classics, but this one is up there with them.  My 18 month old daughter can't get enough of this movie and my nearly 5 year old son loves watching it too. My daughter was not saying any words until she watched this show.

This movie shows a LOT of real life vehicles along with toys and names each of them as they are shown.

I did not find the music eerie at all(as I read from a previous review), in fact, it was quite uplifting.

Throughout the movie, Disney shows families together, mom/son; dad/daughter ect doing things together on bikes/cars/trains, ect.  It is quite an enjoyable movie to watch.

It is a great addition to the collection.",1135641600,9,729,4.395522388059701
2383645,2,B000AAF1UE,"Once Baby Einstein/Julie Clark and crew sold out to Disney the quality of the movies went down hill.  There is way too much animation and less reality in the movies now, with this one being no exception.  The first 10 Baby Einstein videos are the best featuring real toys, puppets, kids and animals--without the cartoons and effects that many baby and child videos contain---THAT IS WHAT MADE THEM SO GOOD IN THE BEGINNING.  Sell out to the big companies and see what happens to quality--happens with everything these days....",1134518400,7,526,4.887640449438202
2383646,4,B000AAF1UE,"my son is 18 months old and has just been allowed to start watching the baby einstein videos--he loves neighborhood animals and world animals and asks for them daily (we watch either ""ducks!"" or ""growls!"" once a day).  after a trip on an airplane over thanksgiving, we decided to get On The Go for him to mix it up a little...

there are indeed good things about this video, but these good things are also encased in bad:

1.  lots of different vehicles--probably too many different ones, in fact...do we need both a 'sailBOARD' AND a 'sailBOAT' in the same segment?

2. loads of BRIGHT colors--but this video has more computer images than 'real life' puppets...the opening segment with the raccoon driving the car over the bright green CG road is a bit much and feels like something from an austin powers movie

3.  the music in this video has an eerie/music box quality to parts of it--the music that accompanies the spinning wheel (which has a car, a plane, a boat and a train on it) is very mellow and tinkly and then the same tune is repeated at various times throughout the video...yes, it's a classical tune BUT it's a watered down, synthesizer version and that just doesn't cut it.

4.  lots of repetition--i.e., the opening sequence features an eye-level shot of a boy riding in a toy car that's pushed by a girl...you see this same footage about 5 minutes later in the 'on the land' segment.

overall, this is a decent dvd (i'm not going to bash it for all of the frontloaded garbage that you have to fast-forward through to get to the real dvd...that's too easy--but suffice it to say it is a pain)--the train segment is great and the vehicles are pretty cool (there are tons of shots of various ones, too)...unlike Neighborhood Animals or World Animals, my son did not want to watch this one straight through--and to me, that's a good thing.",1133222400,30,1853,4.570996978851964
2383647,3,B000AAF1UE,"I thought my son would love this one since he loves cars, planes, and trains. But they made this one way too long and he gets bored after about 10 minutes. Now if I put on any other Baby Einstein that we own he is mesmerized for the 25-30 min. it is on. This one is longer than 40 min and is missing the winning formula of the other Baby Einstein's. Hopefully this is not a new trend since the others are all awesome in my book.",1133222400,2,428,3.9310344827586206
2383648,5,B000AAF1UE,"I am so impressed that Disney could come up with a video that was better than Baby McDonald which WAS my daughter's all time favorite, but she now has a new Baby Einstein that she loves just a little bit more!!!  She was literally sitting on the edge of her chair while she watched Baby On the Go while alternately getting up and flying like a plane or make choo-choo noises or singing the verses she knows of Wheels on the Bus.  I was surprised by how much she interacted versus some of the kid's shows were she just glazes over.  So, not only is this entertaining, it is a great learning tool.

We have been incredibly impressed with the recent Baby Einstein videos that have come out in the past couple of years, and only let our daughter watch television once or twice a week.  That said, the only thing she ever wants to watch is Baby McDonald, Baby Galileo, Baby Noah and now, Baby On the Go.  I would recommend this to any and all moms, and in fact just bought two more as gifts.  Well done, Disney!",1130976000,14,1006,4.2631578947368425
2383649,5,B000AAF1UE,"My 17 month old son can't get enough of this DVD!  From the first moment it was on, he was hooked.  He now picks up the case and brings that one to me when he's chosing a movie.  The puppets and the Wheels on the Bus segments are his favorite.  Nothing stops an attack of the grumps like this one.",1130889600,8,297,3.9
2383650,5,B000AAF1UE,"We've been anxiously awaiting this video and it does indeed deliver some fun for the kids. Love, love, love the Wheels On The Bus!  We've played it over and over already and the surprises in it are simply adorable.  The puppet shows are always a delight too and very clever.  I agree with the last reviewer in that it seems the folks at Baby Einstein forced everything to be the same length because of some silly format rule or something.  In real life, there are lots more things that go on land, and many fewer things that go on water and in air.  One big thing missing is any mention of Monster Trucks or NASCAR.  Hello!?  I don't know about other peoples kids, but those two vehicles are super-heros in a little toddlers world.  With all the hipe around ""cars"" and hot rod shows, I would have thought Disney wouldn't have missed this that.

Regardless, this is one video in our Baby E collection that's sure to be worn out from watching over and over.  It's well worth the money.  It's probably our last, as our kids are growing out of this age range.  We couldn't resist it because ""cars, trucks..."" seem to be an unending passion for our kids.  If you buy the DVD, the bonus stuff is really cute too.  Still gets a top vote from us!",1130284800,5,1238,4.349344978165939
2383651,4,B000AAF1UE,"My daughter and her father take a daily walk near the highway so he can show her the different trucks that cross the bridge to and from Canada.  So, I thought ""Things that go"" would be perfect for her.  After eagerly awaiting the release of this video, I was a little disappointed.  The video is divided into three segments: on land, in water and in the sky.  I think that in the effort to keep the segments the same length, some sections became too detailed and there was not enough detail in others.  I would have liked to see different types of trucks, and I really wasn't interested in some of the water and air vehicles that my baby may never see in real life anyway.

But, Baby (14 months old) enjoyed it and was busy saying ""Twuck! Twuck!"" through most of the video.  The puppet shows are typical Baby Einstein - very silly - and we really enjoyed the ""Wheels on the bus"" segment.  I really think she'll enjoy the video more with her dad since he actually cares about the difference between a parasail and a hang glider.  Definitely, it was worth the $14.",1130198400,6,1062,4.377551020408164
2383652,5,B000AAF1UE,"Like many parents, I want my kid to get a leg up on my life, so I sat my six-month old down in front of ""Baby Einstein - On the Go - Riding, Sailing and Soaring"", left to get a pack of smokes, and then returned 45 minutes later fully expecting a rational human being with whom I could discuss the implications of relativistic space-time on human perceptions of causality.

I strolled into the playroom and casually asked my drooling tyke, ""So, how do you square the idea of the universe emerging from a singularity, thereby implying a first cause, or at least, a prime event, with the later expansion of relativistic space-time and the apparent absence of an absolute reference frame?"" I figured I'd toss the lad a gimme first, just to ease him into a productive dialogue. Little Albert (not his real name) just looked at me, made a squealing noise, and pumped his pudgy arms up and down. I figured he was gathering his thoughts together, so I waited several minutes for a response. Albert looked away and put several fingers in his mouth.

""Albert, did you hear my question?"" I asked, and he turned to me, smiling and gurgling. This conversation was not going well. I pressed him for another hour, asking his opinions on a wide range of topics, sure that I would raise a subject on which he would have an opinion. Albert seemed uninterested not only in physics, but also in music, philosophy, religion, biology, history, art, current events, and even sports. Perhaps he hadn't existed long enough to form opinions, so I probed Albert's budding genius using a battery of tests instead, including the Wechlser Adult Intelligence Scale, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Rorschach, Thematic Apperception, and Bender-Gestalt. According to the results, Albert was the very opposite of a genius, and barely qualified as even conscious. I tried to contain my disappointment. Still, I was thankful that ""Baby Einstein"" uncovered the true lack of potential in my stunted offspring, and now I can save time and expense trying to educate a lost cause. My heart is heavy, but I am thankful I live in a community that has excellent social services and will provide Albert with the structure and care he needs to live out the rest of his life in as meaningful a way as his severely limited intellect will allow.",1129507200,,2309,4.784461152882206

First of all (and I am not sure whether or not this is a teaching technique) both the slow pace and the 3-4 minute intervals with just music and not a single word makes the film really, really boring. If I wanted my son listen to classical music, I would have bought a classical music CD. This was supposed to be educational, hence, engaging, but showing the names of vehicles once at the beginning and once at the end (with music and short films in between) is not only non-educational but also very boring. Secondly, the words introduced are very elementary for a toddler. My son speaks fewer English words than his peers, and still there were only a few words (at least in the part that we watched) that he did not know already. I would recommend this dvd only for a 15-16 month old, not for a toddler who already knows his Thomas, Percy, Rocky, Harold, etc.",1358208000,,1131,4.334905660377358

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443

2383721,5,B000AAF1UE,"We have the Baby Enstein DVD set and our 16 month old twins have been watching them since they were 3 months old.  We recently purchased Baby Einstein On the Go and have been watching it entirely in Spanish. I enjoyed learning to sing ""The Wheels on the Bus"" song with them and look forward to the next Baby Einstein video.",1169856000,,323,4.295081967213115
2383722,4,B000AAF1UE,My son is into everything with wheels that moves. So this video is his favorite. It's in the typical Baby Einstein format but it seems that he's not growing out of it yet evern though he is well into toddlerhood.,1167782400,,212,4.325
2383723,5,B000AAF1UE,"This video was of outstanding interest to my 2 and a half year old grandson who is crazy about cars, trucks, trains, etc.  As usual, the Baby Einstein format and quality is first class.",1162512000,,185,4.4411764705882355
2383724,5,B000AAF1UE,"A great addition to the Baby Einstein collection.  It goes over all the ways to travel pretty much by land, water, and air.  The puppets are cute as usual.  Lots of extras on the dvd.  I recommend this to everyone who has a toddler.  My son has learned many words from this movie.",1156723200,,280,4.2075471698113205
2383725,5,B000AAF1UE,"Our 19-month sold son LOVES this video and has for at least a month now. He really likes several of the Baby Einstein videos, including Baby Neptune, Baby Monet, and Baby Da Vinci.  This one is his new favorite, though.  He loves vehicles in real life, too, so I introduced this show to enhance his learning.  He can now say the names of most of the vehicles on the video.  He especially loves the part about airplanes and helicopters.  I don't know what the person is referring to when s/he mentions ""too many bells and whistles.""  This video has a bit more animation than some of the older Baby Einsteins, but just a bit.  And it still is great about using puppets and humor to teach.  My son adores this video.  I highly recommend it!",1150416000,5,737,4.4

2383727,3,B000AAF1UE,"The last BE we bought was the VERY disappointing Baby Santa's Music Box (the worst BE ever!) and this one is an improvement. My girls, ages 3 years and 15 months, are engaged and will watch most of the movie.

Here is what we liked:

1) The format of the really good BEs is used; relevant vocabulary shown on the screen, puppets doing interesting things, engaging toys moving, and live action footage all set to classical music.

2) The music is upbeat, lively and flows nicely.

3) A interesting assortment of things that travel through the air, water and land, some you would not see everyday, this opens up questions about what they are watching.

Here's what we hated:

1) It is LONG! (40+ minutes)

2) The animation is a litte goofy and unrealistic

3) Some footage is repeated

4) Not as many puppet parts as some of the others

A decent buy, but get it on sale!",1149206400,7,868,4.436708860759493
2383728,3,B000AAF1UE,"My son is 16 months old and totally engrossed with cars, trucks and airplanes.  So I figured this DVD would be a huge hit, but it is really rather disappointing.  While there's a lot of footage of cars, etc, it is completely lacking in any humor or whimsy (with the exception of ""Wheels on the Bus"") that my son really enjoys in Baby MacDonald and Baby Monet.  He sits through about 10 minutes of it just staring at the TV but when he watches the other two DVDs, he laughs and giggles.  Too bad.",1146528000,,495,4.23404255319149

It's simple and was perfect for her when I first bought it when she was about 3 or 4 months old. She still likes it but her favorites are the animal ones by far.,1143331200,,367,3.972972972972973

The first day he already new all the planes, trains and automobiles! And he loves to sing along to the ""school bus"" song! I owen all of the Baby Einstein Videos, and now the ""Little Einsteins"", and I think they are great! Nice, peaceful music, and very educational! My son has been watching these shows since he was about 3 monts, and still enjoys them! I recomend them to Everyone!",1142640000,3,502,4.408602150537634
