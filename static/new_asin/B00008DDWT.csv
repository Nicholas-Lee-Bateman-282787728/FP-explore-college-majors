1839290,5,B00008DDWT,This film is so funny! It brings back so many memories from my childhood. My CKY collection is finally complete.,1391040000,,112,4.65
1839291,2,B00008DDWT,"When I watched it, it skipped over the Skeletor Vs Beastman skit. That skit is listed on the back of the dvd and it's even listed in the scene selection, but when I selected it in scene selection, it just froze up!  I've done a lot of research about this on the internet and apparently there are 3 editions of CKY4; one thats missing both the sex scene of bam and his girlfriend and the beastman vs skeletor skit (this is the edition i ended up receiving), one that doesn't have the sex scene but has the beastman skit, and one that has both. And get this, there's NO way of telling which one until you pop it in and see for yourself, everything down to the UPC barcode is IDENTICAL! so NO way of telling, it's just luck of the drawer, and you're unfortunately most likely to get the most common one, the one that i got, missing both the sex scene and the beastman skeletor skit. There is a neat easter egg though, go to bonus features, select through all the text until the red text disappears, then hit left, then hit right, and then you unlock some hidden features including THE MAKING OF the skeletor vs beastman skit at least.  The whole movie is free on youtube anyway but if you're like me you like having a physical copy, but it's annoying that it's perfectly fine on youtube and on dvd it's missing stuff!",1365984000,,1314,4.315789473684211
1839292,5,B00008DDWT,If you liked 1 2 and 3 you'll like 4. We've watched it several times since purchasing it. Help this tape help you!,1359676800,,114,4.0

1839294,5,B00008DDWT,"I have the 3rd pressing. Which includes everything but the sex scene and the second-half of shopping cart drama, which I don't care much about anyways. Everything is uncensored the way CKY should always be. All the CKY 4 pressings released after the 3rd pressing are terrible. All the faces and other ""naughty stuff"" are blurred out, not to mention Skeletor VS Beastman being removed. So if you buy a new CKY 4 DVD, chances are you'll get a crappy censored DVD that suffers from quality cause every daaamn thing is blurred. Well, come to think about it, if you buy ANY new CKY DVD's you'll get a crappy censored DVD. If you want the original, UNCENSORED CKYs, look for the CKY Box Set, which includes the full CKY 1-3s along with the CKY documentary, and the 1-3rd editions of CKY 4 on a certain bidding website that i'm probably not allowed to name here.",1328400000,,855,4.52258064516129

1839297,1,B00008DDWT,"Skating on and destroying other people's property. Bullying security gaurds who are just trying to make a living.  Potentially hurting bystanders in a club by jumping a floor up ontop of a crowd of people.

The epitome of skateboard assh*les.

Hopefully by the end of Bam's Unholy Union his fans will see him as whipped and quietly crawl back into their holes.

1839326,4,B00008DDWT,"I saw CKY 4 the DVD and downloaded versions and for some reason on the DVD the take out the music skit of Skelletor and Beastman which was by far the funniest thing about the DVD.  The DVD is good still but, lacks being great simly by taking out the music video I say buy the DVD but, if you can go downloaded it and see the music video I'm talking about you will be on the floor rolling at how they poke fun at He-man and his cohorts",1140048000,,434,3.8764044943820224
1839327,5,B00008DDWT,"The first several times I watched this, I seriously wanted to run out and pull stupid stunts too.

Bam and his friends may not be the brightest crayons in the box, but their band of wacky characters and do-it-yourself video editing are strangely charming.  And this is the greatest collection of them all.  Giggle guility as Bam tosses his little sister like a football, a drunken Raab is slammed into a vending machine in a shopping cart, Rake Yohn stars in one of the worst music videos ever made, and Brandon makes prank calls from his hotel room.  In addition to the boys' hilariously stupid, disgusting, and illegal antics, you'll see plenty of skateboarding, see some videos and performances of Brandon's freestyling (and of course, Gnarkill), plus guest appearances by Tony Hawk, the members of CKY, and others.  There are plenty of hidden extras to amuse as well (Raab following KeyKey around the yard is the funniest thing I've ever seen).  This DVD is guaranteed good times for the loser in all of us.  Must watch with friends.",1125446400,,1037,4.792134831460674

1839339,1,B00008DDWT,"First let me say I am a die hard fan of the first 3 CKY movies, but this new one is a load of crap, it's mostly just recycled garbage that wasn't good enough for the first 3 movies. Save your time and money, go buy any of the first 3 DVDs.",1109376000,,239,3.6153846153846154

I have the first UNCUT with everything in it on video, & then I have the gay cut up versions of 2 and 3, then this one with everything in it I believe, get the regualr ones of the first 3, while you still can, because the cut up one, will make you very mad!, buy the Cky's in this order...

1. either get Cky4, or Cky2k

2. Cky<Landspeed>

3. Cky3",1107475200,,428,3.953488372093023
1839341,5,B00008DDWT,"this one is funny as hell, probally the second best, CKY2K is the best. Its really funny, lots of pranks and stunts. And the people who say some of the stuff on the back isn't on the dvd, some of it is easter eggs, which are actually not eggs, there heartagrams.  Get this if you like these CKY dvds, or if your getting introduced to it. CKY 3 is the worst. CKY landspeed isn't as good as this one, or CKY2K, any one is good to get you introduced to the CKY films though, so if you havnt seen this, go out and buy it.",1105920000,,517,3.9238095238095236
1839342,4,B00008DDWT,"This is my first cky video, and I thought it was really funny... but there were a few things that I didn't like about it. The Skeletor/Beastman video was not on it, because apparently its only on certain copies... the song and making of the video is on the DVD, but I would have like to see the video, since it does say on the back of the DVD that the video is on it... along with that, theres about 5 other things listed on the back that are nowhere on this DVD, so that was alittle disappointing.

But even with that stuff missing, I think this is DVD has hilarious skits with great music and skating. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.",1105747200,,658,4.140625
1839343,5,B00008DDWT,"CKY4 is the funniest one yet! It contains everything you want, comedy, great HIM and CKY music, and of course, Phil! There are quite a few Easter Eggs in this DVD, specifically when the little red Heartagram pops up, you have to click ""play"" or ""enter"" to view them. This is truely awesome!",1104278400,,290,4.490566037735849
1839344,5,B00008DDWT,This is pretty funny stuff right here and also sick as hell. If you like cky 3 then get it or if your a fan of jack ass and cky all together. Buy it,1091664000,,148,3.3823529411764706
1839345,1,B00008DDWT,"Regretably, the latest is actually NOT the greatest in the series.  There is just *way* too much recycling of old material from the previous films.
It lacks the wackiness of their earlier stuff.  It's over-produced and uninspired.  There are still a few priceless Brandon and Raab moments and Bam tearing up FDR (skate park) is impressive, but that's about it.
Don't pick this up as your introduction to CKY.  In my opinion, CKY Landspeed and CKY2K are the best, so do yourself a favour and start with that era.",1090195200,,511,4.707865168539326

1839347,5,B00008DDWT,"I recently saw this video when i  borrowed it from my friend, I found it to be funnier than jackass. Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Brandon Dicamillo, and Rake Yohn are hilarious in their strange stunts, from Raab eeing on an electrical fence and being shocked, to Ryan Dunn falling off the roof of a shed in a barrel. I garentee you will find this hilarious. I also recomend you but the other cky videos and music.",1085356800,,422,4.410256410256411

1839359,5,B00008DDWT,"Wow. this movie really is the latest and greatest. I keep thinking that these videos are gonna get repetitive and old but this movie is the best one.

1839361,5,B00008DDWT,"This video is by far one of the best videos i have seen in a while. It is hilarious. It gave me the oppurtunity to found out about the band CKY and HIM. Which has recenlty become two of my favorite bands. This video contains hilarious clips from Bam Margera, Raab Himself, Ryan Dunn etc. I gave this video a five because that is what it deserves. This is a must own dvd for anyone with a tv and dvd player. And it will keep you laughing the entire time.",1074988800,,453,4.044444444444444
1839362,5,B00008DDWT,"I think the CKY videos are awesome. They are funny and they feature really good music in them. The CKY videos also made me find out about one of my favorite bands, H.I.M. Well anyway, this is the latest CKY video. CKY 4: The Latest & Greatest has many hilarious moments. The whole thing is funny. Is it the greatest CKY yet though? Probably. I enjoyed it more than the rest of them. There are many different scenes and stunts. CKY 4: The Latest & Greatest features music by CKY(the best band ever!), H.I.M and Queens of the Stone Age. Go get this DVD.",1074816000,,551,4.3076923076923075
1839363,5,B00008DDWT,"It's funny how a group of friends can make so much money off bieng dumbass's and down-right stupid stunts, but it's what makes CKY4 so hilarious. This DVD is full of more cuts, scrapes, broken bones, and piles of sh*t than anything can ever be seen. If you are grossed out easily..dont even bother because this movie will be sure to make you vomit out your intestines. Sick humor packages this DVD with hilarious skits and unbelievably stupid stunts performed by Bam, Rabb Himself, Rake Yohn, and more..It features awesome skating clips featuring Tony Hawk. Before Jackass ever became a huge hit on MTV, CKY was the one that started it all and forever it will stay above Jackass's made-for-tv level. After flagging controversy on MTV, Jackass doesnt stand a chance to the crazy actions of bored buddies. Bored buddies who piss on electric fences, sh*t out of car windows, roll off roofs in barrels, run around naked, and just act like complete idiots but hey, who wouldn't when they are raking in millions of laughs and money?",1071273600,,1026,4.769662921348314

1839365,5,B00008DDWT,"This is the fourth CKY brought to you by Bam Margera and the CKY gang. It keeps you entertained every second. It shows extended scenes from Jackass and the previous CKY's. It also shows more and more skating and shopping carts. This is a must have for CKY fans. This dvd also has so many hidden easter eggs. Hit enter or play with your remote whenever a red heartagram appears on the screen and a hidden scene will pop up. It  has great skating appearances by Mike Vallely, Geoff Rowley, Arto Saari, Mike Maldonado, and Bam. It is a great dvd and movie all together. Loads of entertainment. Tune in to see, Mike V. & Bam V.S. Security Guards, Bran's Skeletor/Beastman and Mustardman music vids, shopping carts, skating, phil, antiqued, paintball sh*tfu*k and many more scenes from the CKY gang.",1064620800,,794,4.671428571428572
1839366,4,B00008DDWT,"To give you an idea of how sick these guys are, I'll give you a sample of one of the pranks- we see a street corner, with a guy just sitting there, hanging out.  Suddenly, a white van speeds up and screeches to a halt.  A young man jumps out and proceeds to expose his rear.  We see small turds SHOOT out of this guy's butt, making the guy sitting on the corner jump back a good distance.  The rogue pooper then nonchalantly pulls his pants up, jumps back in the van, and speeds off.  The poor guy on the corner can only hold his head in shock at what just happened.  If you're like me and this kind of depravity makes you laugh then pick up CKY4.  You'll not only see skits, but some great skateboarding by Bam Margera and his buddies (and some of the killjoys who tried to put a stop to it), some of their gnarly spills when their tricks don't go as planned- and a couple of comical music videos thrown in for good measure.  The only downside is we see a bit too much of Bam.  Still, this DVD is well worth buying.  Be sure to try and find the easter eggs hidden within the movie.",1057190400,,1082,4.061320754716981
1839386,4,B00008DDWT,"This movie annoyingly shows what you have already seen on cky, cky2k and cky3, new footage is badly needed. Being a huge fan of cky though I have to say that my collection would not be complete without it. The extended versions and Easter Eggs do make it worth the watch but this movie is far from being the best. If you are not a die hard fan or if you have not seen the other cky`s you`ll be dissapointed. Watch cky2k, it`s the best.",1055116800,,435,4.129411764705883
1839387,5,B00008DDWT,"CKY 4: The Latest & Greatest is awesome. This is one of the best CKY DVD's yet, and its a must own for any fan of Jackass or CKY.What you will find in CKY 4 is a group of geniuses performing many stunts that hurt very much and its full of all types of comedy,too. You will wan't to watch it many times because its hilarious! CKY has also been riding in shopping carts long before the popular Jackass came out on MTV and made all this mainstream. CKY 4 also features a killer soundtrack from bands like 'HIM/HER' and of course, CKY. If you need a good laugh, you should pick up a copy of CKY 4. There are some extra scenes on this DVD version,too.",1053129600,,646,4.094488188976378

1839389,5,B00008DDWT,"CKY4 is the latest effort from the hilarious ongoing series starring Bam Margera, Brandon DiCamillo, Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, Jess Margera, Deron Miller, Chad Ginsburg, amoung some of the names. CKY4 is most like CKY3 (which is my favorite), and is one of the best, though it's too soon to place it in rank just yet. And don't let the other reviews scare you (or the title): this video is not just a collection of re-runs from the past videos. It has about 5 minutes worth or re-runs if you were to add it all together, and most of them are on the bonus features anyway. Another cool thing about this DVD are the hidden scenes, or ""Hidden Easter Eggs"", in which during certain parts of the film the HIM sign, or the ""heartagram"", will pop up at the bottom right hand corner of the screen. If you click ""X"" on your PS2 control (which is what I watch it on) or ""Play"" or ""Enter"" or whatever it is you access thing on on your DVD player, it will show you a bonus skit or scene. One part in which this sign will pop up isafter Raab Himself's Key-Key scene, in which Key-Key runs off. The sign pops when it says ""To Be Contuvre."" It will unlock the hidden scene in which Raab searches for Key-Key in Times Square.
Some skits/pranks in this DVD contain (and I'm not spoiling anything; it says them all on the back of the DVD in case you were worried about me ruining it for you):
Phil Plunger Extended
Mustard Man Music Video
Paintball s**tf**ck
Skeletor & Beastman Music Video
Gay Fags
Raab Times Square s**t
The 70 mph s**t
Gambling

It has clips and skits from the previous 3 CKYs and Jackass. But it has tons of new skits too.
One of the funniest new skits is the ""Skeletor & Beastman"" video. There is also a Trailer for Bam's Haggard. The music in this one is great. Lot's of HIM and Lots of CKY(The Band). Plus there is a whole segment with CKY doing a G.G. Allen cover live and Chad going to G.G.'s grave. There are a ton of Easter Eggs hidden in it also.

Some of this stuff has been shown on Jackass but it's uncensored and shown complete in this video.
