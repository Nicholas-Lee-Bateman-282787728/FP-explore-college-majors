7918532,4,B00003ETO1,Could of used a little more back story on some of the films presented.  The additional features were not well presented.,1509062400,,120,4.714285714285714
7918533,2,B00003ETO1,Just a string of previews with very limited commentary.  All of the extras are only partial bits of the original shorts (they advertise as if the whole thing is there).  I am returning my copy.,1490659200,,193,4.485714285714286

7918535,2,B00003ETO1,I bought this thinking these were the full length movies. It's not. It's just a review of great movies from the 60s. Not all that great.,1223337600,,136,4.269230769230769
7918536,1,B00003ETO1,"After reading these reviews I hope any sensible buyer will stay clear of this inferior disc. I contacted the seller to alert him of the fact that during the bonus featurette section (the reason I purchased the item)the DVD consistently froze. It was during the early part of the ""Funny Girl"" segment and no matter how you tried you couldn't fast forward or chapter yourself out of the frozen frame. I tried it in three different DVD players and each time it froze at the same exact spot. Playing it on my computer I fared no better. I never got a reply from the seller and there was no phone listing for the distributing  company listed on the box. Even if this poorly assembled documentary wasn't defective it still wouldn't be worth considering due to the horrendous picture quality. Besides being faded and grainy, there are scratches on the negatives with flashes of green lines on the print. It's about as ugly as it gets. If you ever run across it at one of those dollar stores I would still recommend passing it up.",1204156800,4,1022,4.554347826086956
7918537,1,B00003ETO1,"Be wary of this release! Ostensibly a special, it is a poorly strung together compendium of movie trailers! Additionally, the special Featurette section stops each video mid sentence at the 4 minute mark (on 10 minute shorts!). Definitely a slapped together, low budget DVD meant to trick buyers.",1071792000,23,296,5.1875
7918538,2,B00003ETO1,"This DVD lets you in on lots of behind-the-scenes info about our favorite musicals from the 60s, but the quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired. I bought this elsewhere online, new, and some of the segments were suddenly cut short (in mid-sentence, even). So buyer beware.",1068508800,10,283,4.795918367346939
7918539,1,B00003ETO1,"To the point:
If you are a musical fan there is not much that this DVD will inform you that you don't already know. The thing that really bothers me is the bad quality in most of the clips. But if you are doing a research than you might find it's quite helpful. To conclude they should just sell it as a VHS format.",1013472000,17,315,3.9375
