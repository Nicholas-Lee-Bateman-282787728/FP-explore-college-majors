8467062,5,B005DKS1ZI,"Just like in Lina Wertmuller's ""Mim&igrave; metallurgico ferito nell'onore"" (""The Seduction of Mimi"") 1972, Luigi Comencini's ""Delitto d'amore"" (""Crime of Love"") 1974, was also concerned with the dichotomy between Italy's north and south. And of the working-class in general, but with less of an emphasis on the comical aspects. This was most definitely a social-melodrama as opposed to a satire. When fellow factory-workers: 'Nullo' (Giuliano Gemma) and 'Carmela' (Stefania Sandrelli) fell in love (he's Milanese and she's Sicilian), they began a courtship that was soon tested by the characteristics of their regional differences, with some humorous results. Their plight was symbolic of how love and understanding can overcome all obstacles, including divisions between: class, religion, politics, and place of origin. The acting by the two principal actors Giuliano Gemma and Stefania Sandrelli were simply magnificent. To see Ms. Sandrelli in this film is to behold: Beauty itself! She was radiant as the young Sicilian woman. Here Ms. Sandrelli was again cast against type (she's a Tuscan that has portrayed Sicilians many times before: i.e. in Pietro Germi's ""Divorzio all'italiana"" 1961 and ""Sedotta e abbandonata"" 1964). Her looks epitomize a Boticelli painting; which is only natural, because her native soil runs through her blood. I think it would have been realistic and ideal to have a native born actress who knows the accent and dialect of Sicily. But in retrospect, Ms. Sandrelli's image has lent this film its inseparable quality and I can't see anyone else in her role! The film was beautifully captured by Luigi kuveiler, and Carlo Rustichelli's touching and melodic musical score, gave it the lyricism of European Cinema's heyday. As there already is an excellent review that eloquently describes the film, I'll just simply say, do not let what has been given away (the DVD synopsis detail), deter you from buying this timeless classic. A valuable addition in every cinephile's collection, by all means get this warm and heartbreaking story. Raro Video has masterfully restored the film for this DVD release. The picture and sound quality is excellent. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), NR 101 mins. Grazie!

Love and Peace,

8467063,5,B005DKS1ZI,"['Delitto D'Amore' AKA 'Crime of Love' - 1974 - Widescreen presentation - In Italian with English subtitles - directed by Luigi Comencini] Despite the fact that another reviewer has somewhat spoiled the subtleties by giving up the entire plot of this film, don't let that put you off from seeing this one, as the journey is far more interesting than the destination in this case. The magnificent performance by Stephania Sandrelli, which is undoubtedly her best among the films I've seen (and I wish more of her releases were available in NTSC format) is worth the price of the film alone. And having her paired with Giuliano Gemma, who also gives a great performance, insures a memorable experience in spite of the fact that the film's outcome is already known. But there is one element in the ending that hasn't been unveiled, and that additional detail promotes further need to see this excellent film. To say nothing of director Luigi Comencini's unerring eye in framing the characters, unveiling the conditions and environmental decay that makes it seem even more relevant today than when originally released.

This film seems out of place in the pantheon of 70's Italian cinema, having much more in common with the earlier neorealist movement as well as Antonioni's 'Red Desert', which was dominated by political and crime dramas, broad sex comedies and the sadistic mayhem of the giallo and derivative horror genres of the time as Italy's heyday of relevant cinema was drawing to a close after several decades of remarkable significance. Unlike Antonioni's themes of numbing if not maddening alienation, this film draws one inside the main character's emotional conscience and conflict, along with the themes of mainland Italy's (the North) hastened ""progress"" during this time period versus the archaic primitivism and cultural backwardness of Sicilian culture (the South) that made for uncomfortable and uneasy coexistence in what was supposed to be a progressive, contemporary society. Surmounting these struggles is what drives the story along to its bittersweet if not painful and tragic conclusion.

RaroVideo has once again delivered an impeccable digitally restored picture print with fine mono audio in a correct aspect ratio, improved subtitles, an interview with Italian film historian Adriano Apra and an impressive booklet featuring an interview with Comencini, a biography, notes on the film's music and an anthology of comments and reviews from the film's original release era. Impressive all-around for the price, we're gratefully treated to a Criterion-like release without the steep price tag. All lovers of Italian cinema need to treat themselves to 'Crime of Love'. Indeed, it would be a crime not to.",1336262400,4,2728,5.254587155963303
