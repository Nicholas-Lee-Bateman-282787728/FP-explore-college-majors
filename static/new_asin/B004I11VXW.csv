8429791,2,B004I11VXW,"This Blu-Ray Audio only disc is Region Free, as are all Naxos releases.

Presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.0 and LPCM2.0 @ 96kHz/24bit, this disc sounds muddy, in either sound option.  There is no other word to describe it.  The orchestra is indistinct and even the piano lacks the clarity and resonance expected from high-rez discs.  I'd be very interested to compare it to the Redbook CD version of the same performances, as they are extremely good performances, only marred by the sound quality in this format.  It certainly doesn't stack up aurally against my SACDs of the same concertos.  My advice is to demo it before you buy, as you can pick up the RBCDs for under $5.00.

If Naxos is trying to woo the audiophiles away from SACD to Blu-Ray, this offering will not be the answer. It seems clear that they need to engage better engineers as EuroArts and other labels manage to produce Blu-Ray discs with spectacular sound.

A great disappointment.",1299715200,,955,4.745454545454545
