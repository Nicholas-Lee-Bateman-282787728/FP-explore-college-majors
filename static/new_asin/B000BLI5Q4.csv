8088702,5,B000BLI5Q4,"Although directed by Hiroshi Ikeda, this is also one of those early Hayao Miyazaki efforts as writer and scene organizer (and also looks like he may have had a hand in the character designs as someone else mentions here), this is the young filmmaker getting more production responsibilities in feature animated films. 'Animal Treasure Island' is a fun movie for kids and adults.  I highly recommend it to fans looking to discover Miyazaki's growing production skills and style in his early years.  I also, of course, recommend it for family screenings with little kids.  Some of the material would later rise up again in a different form in a new and most perfect/spectacular way in the Lupin III movie 'Castle of Cagliostro'.

It's great to see this classic earliy film released with the original voice track in Japanese with English subtitles, but it's also finally great to see the Fred Ladd dub track with his company of dependable character actors wonderfully up to the task. Mr. Ladd also directed the dubbing of the 'Wonderful World of Puss `N Boots', the first original 'Astro boy' series released in the U.S.(recorded in New York back then)and later he also directed the English dub adaption of the 1960's classic 'Kimba the White Lion'.  He was the first and THE best for a time when anime was trying to sprout its early wings in front of a U.S. audience.",1380931200,,1365,4.791489361702127

8088704,5,B000BLI5Q4,"This movie is a must for any anime fan.  It highlights miyazaki's early work before he became famous for his movies(Spirited Away, Princes mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle). The DVD quality is outstanding for a movie that has not been on TV for over 20 years!!!",1142553600,5,259,4.7555555555555555
8088705,5,B000BLI5Q4,"Fun for kids and adults of all ages, Animal Treasure Island is loosely based on the original Treasure Island novel by Robert L. Stevenson. This has never before been available on Video or DVD. Jim and Cathy are the only humans in the film, the pirates are all animals and even Jims best friend is a mouse. This interesting and particular twist on the original tale makes it stand out as an incomparable motion picture.

Featuring story consultation and key animation by the master of Japanese anime films and founder of Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki. This is a very rare look into the origins of Miyazaki and glimpses of some of his future characters. Kathy looks strikingly similar to many of Miyazakis future heroines including Princess Nausicaa of ""Nausicaa Valley of the Wind"" and Lady Clarisse of ""Castle of Cagliostro.""

The film is presented as originally shown in theaters in widescreen format. Discotek has also managed to include the very rare English language version. So fans of the Japanese language with subtitles version, and fans of English dubbed versions can both enjoy the film. Very recommended and a must have for fans of classic Japanese animation. Kudos to Discotek for releasing this very rare gem on DVD. Hopefully if these titles do well they will release some more classic animation including some of the extremely rare titles that have never been seen in the US.",1136678400,5,1390,4.910638297872341
8088706,5,B000BLI5Q4,"American fans of this never before released-on-video TOEI animated classic have been waiting more than THIRTY years to see this early example of Hayao Miyazaki's work, even longer if they missed its occasional showings on TV, which apparently ended a generation ago.  What's more, for those of us who remember Fred Ladd's well-done English dubbing that was shown on American TV so long ago, Discotek Media has wisely included it as the second audio track.  The English audio is a little the worse for wear, and the English credits are unfortunately missing, but unless and until someone wants to pony up the money for a modern re-dubbing, it is better to include it than not because purists can always choose the Japanese audio track with English subtitles.

Parental note: the presumably more recent optional English subtitles, which vary considerably from Fred Ladd's English dub, contain a couple of frequently used exclamations some parents might find a little questionable; suffice it to say that somebody may have forgotten he was subtitling a children's movie.

Miyazaki is listed both as a key animator and the writer responsible for this extremely loose adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, but as usual with Miyazaki his contributions undoubtedly exceeded even his listed credits.  For example it seems certain that he had a big hand in character design.  Then there is the reappearance of so much of Animal Treasure Island in Miyazaki's later work.  The spunky, blue-clad heroine is almost a Miyazaki trademark, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B002ZTQVHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>&nbsp;looks like Miyazaki's later attempt to do this kind of story better.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lupin-the-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/dp/B00PEA6LJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lupin the 3rd: The Castle of Cagliostro</a>&nbsp;also owes a lot to Animal Treasure Island.  Now there is no question that the animation will seem a little primitive and dated compared to Studio Ghibli's work, but it holds up rather nicely for its age.

I hesitate to say too much about the plot because no matter how many versions of Treasure Island you've seen, you've never seen anything like this.  It has about as much connection to RLS's Treasure Island as Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B002ZTQVHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>&nbsp;does to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, and given how heavily that highway has been traveled, that's a blessing IMHO.  Let's just say that this version set in a mostly talking animal world includes one motorized, fore-and-aft rigged, one-gun, sea-going barrel; one tag along baby brother; one pirate's granddaughter; lots and lots of semi-serious sword fights; a whole bunch of things that don't really belong in tempura; one pirates' collective; a couple of rousing choruses; the Iron Boar; one soft-hearted walrus; one treacherous fox; and possibly the meanest Silver ever.

Note: Miyazaki fans will find it interesting to compare and contrast this film with the earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>&nbsp;(1968) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>&nbsp;(1969), a couple more long lost (until recently) TOEI classics that Miyazaki worked on and Fred Ladd dubbed into English.",1135468800,11,3790,6.588353413654619
8088707,4,B000BLI5Q4,"For anime and Miyazaki fans, ""Animal Treasure Island"" may be nothing put an interesting footnote in the animation master's career. Serving as key story consultant and animator, this early effort is nevertheless a showcase of Miyazaki-san's soon to be signature moments - especially in (of course I'm only making a conjecture here) the wonderfully staged and frantic action set pieces that make up most of this fun movie and may remind fans of similar moments in ""Sherlock Hound"", ""Porco Rosso"" and ""Castle in the Sky"". In fact, it probably wouldn't be quite a stretch to presume that the young Jim as depicted in this version was an early precursor to Miyazaki's ""boy heroes"" like Future Boy Conan and Pazu while the character Cathy has moments reminiscent of Nausicaa, Princess Clarisse (from ""The Castle of Cagliostro"") and Princess Mononoke.

First and foremost, this is a family film and the cartoon violence never escalates beyond the Looney Tunes variety. Even after all these years, I'm still greatly entertained by the slapstick humor and the fast pacing and action. It's a ""Terry and the Pirates"" type of adventure moreso than a faithful adaptation of the classic novel. The video quality of the DVD looks fine for a film of this age (the colors are crisp and the old style animation still holds up nicely and looks beautiful widescreen). The Japanese language track (with English subtitles) is available but special kudos to Discotek Media for bringing back the original English language dub (including the English version of the movie's songs!) from the rarely seen American International Pictures(?) release.

I definitely have a soft spot for the classic anime features from the 60's and early 70's and look forward to more being brought over Stateside!",1133222400,4,1766,5.086206896551724
