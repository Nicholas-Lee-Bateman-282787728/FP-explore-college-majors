4284891,5,B0047DKLDC,"Allison (50ft. Woman) Hayes was more than hot stuff when this steamy jungle classic was filmed. Here she plays the bored housewife of a psychology doctor who just also happens to be a Voodoo Jungle Priestess. She wears tight clothing and seduces any man in sight to do her evil bidding. When three Americans on a photo shoot arrive at their jungle hideaway with one of them suffering from horrible lion wounds the doctor (old geezer) and his distant wife (sexy young thing) give them refuge. Lots of voodoo ritual and mumbo jumbo follow as our three heroes and their sidekick guide sort things out while trying to stay alive.
I don't know why most cinema books pan this film as sheer dreck. The acting is really quite good, the sets well done, the story line interesting, and I didn't find it lagging at all, actually I thought it moved along pretty well for it's short time duration. And of course there's Allison Hayes, sultry, sexy, lying, cheating, conniving, dominating and heating up every scene she's in, especially the ritualistic voodoo sacrifice dance with the dead chicken. But maybe I'm just a sucker for this back lot jungle stuff as I'm partial to BRIDE OF THE GORILLA as well, also with a bored sexy seductress, an old geezer husband and some more voodoo nonsense.
The widescreen Warner Archive DVD is outstanding, crisp and clear, this film probably never looked this good when it played the drive-in circuit. This is a fun yet exciting jungle voodoo film, played seriously with little intentional humor. I enjoyed it and can recommend it for fans of back lot jungle thrills and the 1950s horror genre.",1424044800,2,1618,4.761565836298932
4284892,4,B0047DKLDC,"OK B quality horror flick from the late 50's starring the beautiful Allison Hayes.  She plays a vaguely half-caste temptress who is a disinterested wife and a devoted, dutiful voodoo high priestess.  Her husband, a European doctor, either hasn't a clue as to what she's up to or doesn't care.  Into this little domestic fray enter three Americans on a photo safari.  Hayes starts to put her swiveling hips moves on the guys who strike her fancy.  Supposed to be Africa but the locals are both Black and vaguely Polynesian.  Obviously filmed on the back-lot.  Typical time-passer from the Chiller Theater era.  The Warner Archive DVD-R is excellent quality but has no extras, not even the trailer.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1414886400,3,732,4.8861788617886175
4284893,5,B0047DKLDC,"B-movie  Sc-Fi/Horror queen Allison Hayes (Attack of the 50-ft  Woman) stars in  this  steamy  1957  voodoo/ jungle  thriller from Allied Artists. Also  starring with Paul Burke,  Hayes performs  a sensual ritual  dance one is unlikely to  forget.  Great  fun.",1403222400,5,260,5.333333333333333
4284894,4,B0047DKLDC,"[The Disembodied - (1957) - directed by Walter Grauman - Widescreen - B+W - 66 minutes] Who do that Voodoo that you do so well? Why, it's Allison Hayes, of course, one of the late 50's most significant sultry sex sirens, who devours men and every scene she appears in here, before she went onto larger roles (literally - her next stop, 'Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman'). Single-handedly elevating this trite schlocky mock voodoo horror flick into a memorable excursion into the jungles of exotic mondo exploitation, she exudes a hypersexual aroma and erotic ambiance that was forbidden in the McCarthy era films of that time. Her presence (and wardrobe) alone makes this one mandatory viewing for those old enough to remember 'Creature Feature' and 'Chiller Theater', and holds up better than similar B-movie fanfare like 'The 4 Skulls of Jonathan Drake', 'Voodoo Island' and its ilk.

The steamy African jungle provides the backdrop for Tonda (Hayes), the restless and irresistible wife of her older doctor husband, who seduces every man in sight when she's not presiding over native ceremonies in her other role as voodoo high priestess, slinking, slithering and writhing around like a drugged cobra in fetching barely-there animal print Fredrick's of non-Hollywood apparel. When Paul Burke and his cronies arrive by jeep seeking medical assistance for a colleague who was shredded by a lion, Tonda takes it upon herself to consume Burke sexually and get him to kill her husband for her. There are more rituals, sacrifices and jealous rage to keep things lively for the duration of this mercifully short flick before boredom sets in and Hayes' allure wears off, and that's why it succeeds; another fifteen minutes and it would be more whimper than bang for your buck.

The remastering is exceptional - sound, picture and contrast superb, so fans of Miss Hayes, pulpy jungle horror and/or voodoo flicks and campy 50's B-flicks should find this intriguing and entertaining lightweight film viewing. It's voodoo with va-va-voom thanks to Hayes, and comes recommended to fans of her 'body' of work. 2  stars elevated to 4 for this reason - you'll have to do your own math to see if that's enough for you. 'Worked for me.",1366416000,6,2214,4.962264150943396

8418031,4,B0047DKLDC,good movie on voodoo. A hunting safari has a man wounded by a lion brought to a native village.they meet a doctor who has a beautiful native wife who he is very jealous of and for good reason.she also happens to be the local voodoo queen and hates her husband who she earlier tried to kill with voodoo. She saves the wounded hunter sort of by voodoo and makes a play for the heroe claiming her husband put her under a spell and she didn't know it was voodoo.the voodoo womens husband is a big enough jealous jerk who has threatened the heroe with a gun so this becomes believeable until the voodoo women (Allison Hayes) shows her true colors.the voodoo women puts the heroe up for sacrifice and i'llstop here so i don't ruin the ending.good movie for horror lovers,1488931200,,764,4.425531914893617
