This has got to be one of the best deals you could ever get from the UFC, two of the best events they have put on for the price of one. In this set you will get to see RANDY COUTURE dominate both Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz in each event. You will also get to see UFC legends David ""Tank"" Abbot and Kimo go head to head in a very surprising bout. Also there are fights that include Frank Mir, Wes Sims, Tra Telligman, Pedro Rizzo, Matt Linland, Yves Edwards, Vitor Belfort to name a few and that is just in 43. 44 will give you Rich Franklin, Tim Sylvia and many more. But like I said earlier this set is more then worth it for Randy Couture's two fights, as he basically destroys his two very well known and popular opponents. Since I have reviewed both of these events I will not go into detail, if you want to know more about each event check out my reviews for each. As for this I recommend getting this for the price of one. Fights include-
