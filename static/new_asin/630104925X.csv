318930,5,630104925X,"Others here have done a good job of reviewing this excellent mini-series adaptation of Bleak House, so I will focus briefly on the DVD from BBC/Warner.  Bleak House is conveniently divided into eight episodes of about 50 min. each.  Four episodes appear on each side of a two-sided disc.  Each episode is in turn divided into chapters that can be accessed quickly from the menu.  The 4:3 (fullscreen) presentation looks pretty good for the most part, and I didn't notice any problems with dust or scratches on the source print.  The picture does, however, vary somewhat in sharpness from scene to scene.  Colors and contrast, for the most part, look very good.  For a made-for-TV production, the overall video quality is quite watchable.  The audio is also nice and clear.  Though there are no subtitles, this DVD is closed-captioned, which comes in very handy when certain characters with strong accents speak.  No extras of any kind are included (personally, I place little value on DVD extras anyway).  This DVD will likely please those who love this nearly seven-hour Dickens feast.  Highly recommended for Dickens fans and fans of period dramas in general.",1127865600,82,1161,4.989583333333333
318931,5,630104925X,"Excellent leading portrayals by Elliott Denholm and the great Diana Rigg.  The general mood and the dark, misty ambiance of the film reflect the true reality of the Victorian era, its urban plight and pollution.  It is truly  a cinematic and poignant film about how the different lives were entangled  under the whirlpool of the Chancery court.  This adaptation has a different  ending regarding cousin Richard, which is more dramatic and realistic on  the screen. Whether or not you read the book, the ending will be a  surprise.  By the way, it is a very long book.  The performance of Ms. Rigg  is a piece of fine art, and it really shows her metier as a graduate of the  Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.  Only she could have portrayed her  undeniable love for Sir Leicester with such a delicate nuance and pure  sincerity.  Coupled with a haunting chamber music, it is the best 6 hs.  one can spend, where one can be entertained with a fine piece of art and at  the same time reflect about life's vicissitudes and historical periods. The  conflicts and human relations depicted in this masterpiece of Charles  Dickens are as timeless as the human condition.",943660800,144,1160,4.705
319022,5,630104925X,"This movie is true to the book, and not in any way dumbed down. The acting is just superb. Several great actors and actresses from the older school of superlative BBC theatre are in this production. Peter Vaughn can not be surpassed in his role of the insidious,treacherous and hard hearted lawyer Mr. Tulkinghorn whom is literally seething with malice. Diana Rigg plays her role of the ill fated Lady Dedlock with expertise, and sophisticated strength not seen in many roles for women, and she doesn't miss a beat. And Denholm Elliot plays the kindly, but troubled Mr. John Jarndyce whom is unfortunately entangled in dealings with the corrupt court of Chancery, when taking in three orphaned wards to live with him and benefit from his kindnesses. All the actors play their roles with such subtlety and skill. There is no talking down to the audience by having to fit in explanations of the scenes or plots, and no amateurish slap you in the face type acting. The only person I can think of that I did not care for their acting, was a very small role of Lady Dedlock's young maid. The unsavory ne'er-do-well Mr. Skimpole who makes no pretense about his idle life which is supported by any one he can make use of is played so perfectly, that you can't help but feel sickened by his offensive, odious behavior. In my opinion this is acting at it's very best. If you enjoy movies that do not rely on high excitement and that really make you think, and give you a lot to chew on, then you would probably enjoy sinking your teeth into this complex story, with it's flawless acting.",1459468800,6,1578,4.579505300353357

319104,5,630104925X,"The 2005 ""Bleak House"" from the BBC has solid merits, but this one, from 1985, I think does a better job of catching the atmosphere of Dickens's novel.  I'll indicate some differences and try to give my reasons for preferring this one, but ""Bleak House"" fans should have both -- they're both thoughtfully made.  If you have the 2005 version (with Gillian Anderson and Carey Mulligan), note the price of this one, and don't pass up the chance to get it.  The two versions make some different choices in plot development.  For example, in 2005, more attention is given throughout to the growing obsession of Richard Carstone with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case. And also in 2005, the handling of the suspects in the Tulkinghorn murder by Inspector Bucket is more detailed and arguably clearer.  On the other hand, in 1985, the search for Lady Dedlock is developed at greater length and with considerable emotional power.  On the whole, though, the amount of plot information relative to the original novel is better condensed in 2005, which even finds a place for Mrs Jellaby and which sets up the attraction between Esther and Woodcourt earlier and thus makes Woodcourt's return more poignant and suspenseful.  The clarity and detail that 2005 brings to a complicated plot is very impressive.

My reservation about 2005 is that it is on the whole too cheerful.  2005's Jarndyce, Dennis Lawson, has put the court case behind him and is much more cheerfully encouraging to the younger generation than 1985's Denholm Elliott, who is a darker and more troubled man altogether.  Elliott gives a great performance, fully in command of the tenderness, anger, and bitterness of Jarndyce.  This is no criticism of Lawson, but represents a directorial choice about how the atmosphere at Bleak House is to be represented.  If you agree with me that ""Bleak House"" is a dark novel indeed, then you'll see why I prefer 1985.  As with Jarndyce, Suzanne Burden's 1985 Esther is a more withdrawn, less loquacious, more depressive character than Anna Maxwell Martin's 2005 version.  You can believe that the lack of tenderness in childhood has left its mark in Burden's conception of the role, which is downbeat even before the smallpox episode.  Peter Vaughan's superb 1985 Tulkinghorn is more blunt and brutal than Charles Dance's equally effective but more suave devil of 2005.  And Diana Rigg is every bit as effective in 1985 as Gillian Anderson is later.  Her scenes with Tulkinghorn are very strong indeed.  The despicable Skimpole is very strongly portrayed in both versions, though his part in Richard's downfall is made clearer sooner in 2005.  I also found 1985's Mr Guppy better conceived than the cartoonish character of 2005, and Sylvia Coleridge's Miss Flite is much more effective and disturbing than the pleasantly dotty version that we get in 2005 -- again, a judgment on the director's conception and not on the acting, which is fine in both, but the 1985 version requires, as with the representation of Jarndyce, a much wider emotional range.

Finally, there's the look -- the grime, dirt, and fog of London, which stands in the novel as a kind of correlative to the murk and ugliness of the legal procedures, is much more vividly realized in 1985.  Bleak House itself is an escape from that, but even there it is often dull and rainy, as if the court case's infection, like the smallpox, has penetrated to and scarred a potentially idyllic place.  And while one can admire the care with which Richard's downfall is chronicled in 2005 and might criticize his disappearance from some of the middle of 1985's plot, it is all the more shocking to see suddenly the demented creature he has become in the 1985 version.  I certainly felt that cheerfulness was too easily won at the end of 2005, with Ada seeming unscarred in the scenes of Esther's marriage.  1985 stops well short of that, and the ending is sober and more appropriate, given the tone of the book and the tone of this 1985 version that has succeeded in doing it justice.",1429920000,3,4031,4.851094890510949

I was disappointed in the musical accompniment in this version which I found so intrusive - especially in the last episode. It could certainly not be called ""background"" music but more a musical dialogue that was ongoing. I especially noticed it in the last episode in which it was very much too loud. At one point near the end a character whispered a crucial reply to a question put to him, which was bad enough but the musical dialogue remained undiminished & interfered with understanding what was said. Musical backgrounds are only very rarely handled well in movies or TV presentations & in this presentation I could only rate it as amateurishisly done - which unfortunately detracted from the presentation.

I chose the Diana Rigg, Denholm Elliott (1985)mainly because of cost.  I have regretted my choice.  I viewed the (2006) some time ago and now comparing the two, the more recent production was far superior.

There were times through the film, if I had not known the story fairly well, I would not have had any idea of what it was all about until near the end.  The colour was dark which seemed to add to its mystery.

 It must take great skill to bring out the depth of Dicken's study of human nature but this production seemed to miss it in my opinion.  The acting was very good but it did not seem the right cast for Denhom Elliott; not his usual role.

319213,4,630104925X,"My review goes from a warning about when NOT to view this DVD to a recommendation to be sure not to miss it. Just choose the right time.

The surroundings are probably as close to authentic as anything you'll ever see. The plot is full of intrigue. Dickens must have been feeling depressed as he wrote it and the despair was overwhelming to me as I watched it. It was so powerful that I felt as if my heart was in my throat, almost too much to watch for more than an hour. If that sounds dramatic, it is. This is drama at the highest level of severity.

Bleak House is probably not the place to start if you are new to Dickens. It's also not where you spend time if you are easily depressed or trying to cheer yourself up. The plot, as usual, is twisted and complex, but in this one it's even more so because of the dreadfully dreary surroundings. It has a very HEAVY feel to it. London is shown as dirty, depressing, almost hellish. The scenes are dark and at times difficult to see much. Some of the settings are claustrophobic.

Now to the better part. The actors are excellent and the characters for the most part charming and lovable. There is some comic relief, and with all the despair and poverty, your emotions will be ready for a break before going back into the dirty, murky,  foggy streets of London again.

The plot is extraordinary. I hadn't read the book, so this is a new Dickens novel to me. If you read a description of the plot, as I did, you might wonder why you would want to watch it, but I started caring about what happened to the characters from the first couple of moments.

I don't know how helpful this has been to most people, but if you are a new Dickens reader/viewer, start with David Copperfield or Little Dorrit. Come on back to this one when you are in the mood for something dark, dreary, and mysterious. It's equally brilliant, maybe even more so, but the mood is severe. Choose to watch it when you are ready for it. Otherwise you may start it and put it away about 30 minutes into it, and you would miss out on a story worth viewing.",1272240000,10,2072,4.2729591836734695

319215,5,630104925X,"Although this interpretation of Charles Dickens' Bleak House lacks the flash and intensity of the 2005 remake, in many respects it is a more faithful rendition of the novel. Dickens wrote Bleak House as a serial spanning well over 70 chapters. The serialization allowed Dickens to introduce numerous characters and plot lines, much like the Soap Operas of today. When the BBC first decided to transform the novel into a series (a suitable format for such a long rambling tale), they streamlined the story, eliminating some of the extraneous characters and events. This made for a much more coherent plot, and allowed the screenplay to focus on the main themes of Bleak House: the misery of the poor, the abuses of the legal system, and, of course, the redeeming power of kindness.

This 1985 production was remarkable for its depth and subtlety. It truly captured the feel of the novel: the mud, the hopelessness, the perpetual fog (both literal and figurative). Much of it was filmed in candlelight, which contributed to the overall murky mood of the series. The portrayal of the characters was perfect. Dickens liked to include a number of quirky personalities to offset the more realistic main players in his stories, which can lead to a production rife with caricatures. This production avoided that pitfall by including an element of sympathy. Miss Flite, in the fine tradition of Shakespeare's Fool, was a spokesperson for unpalatable truths. Guppy, far from the buffoon in the remake, proved himself to be an honorable man. And Esther, in contrast to her rather insipid counterpart in the remake, showed considerable backbone, proving herself to be a true daughter of Lady Dedlock.

While all of the performances were excellent, it was Denholm Elliott, playing the role of John Jarndyce, who was the anchor of the series. Elliott performed with passion, with fury, and with an eloquence that voiced all of Dickens' deepest feelings. As its central figure, Elliott held the entire series together, providing an overarching sense of continuity that was lacking in the remake.

While I admit that the dramatic impact of this series was reduced by its tendency to rely on exposition rather than showing the events themselves, I enjoyed it more than the remake. Dickens was a marvelous writer, with a passion for his characters and for the ideas they represented, all of which came across clearly in this series. Rather than struggling to figure out what was going on, I could sit back and appreciate what the characters had to say--what Dickens had to say--which, after all, was the point.",1257897600,24,2592,5.009280742459397
319216,5,630104925X,"This 1985 adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Bleak House"" is not nearly so detailed as the 2005 adaptation, with Andrew Davis' screenplay. However, the film is still quite good.

Reasons:

1.
The mood of this film is excellent. Where the 2005 adaptation is colorful and overall uplifting, this 1985 adaptation is very dark and moody. In London (especially Krook's dwelling) and Chesney Wold, the scenes are shot with little sunlight. Often, the viewer can only notice characters speaking, with the background partly obscured in darkness. The street scenes are especially well-done, showing the massive amount of fog and other industrial pollution. Additionally, the cobblestone streets contain much horse manure. While the 2005 adaptation was meant to tell the story in a more positive, less melancholic light, I think there is something to gain in watching an adaptation where the real depression and poverty of London is shown.

2.
In the 2005 adaptation of Bleak House, Andrew Davies' screenplay is exceptional. Additionally, with 21st-century technology, more digital effects can be included. The grandeur of the 2005 BBC adaptation is financially impossible for this 1985 BBC/A&E co-production. This said, the cinematography is still excellent because of the minute inexpensive details that do not exist in the 2005 adaptation. For example, the crying of indigent children covered in fifth. The 2005 adaptation does not as effectively penetrate the slums of London to show the poverty of the lower classes. Additionally, the scenes in Chancery are not as well done (from the ironic viewpoint) in the 2005 adaptation as this 1985 one. For one thing, the 2005 adaptation places the parties in Chancery suits near the chancellor, where the 1985 adaptation correctly places then in a balcony above.

3.
The screenplay of this film is much more Shakespearian and Dicksonian from the standpoint of ironic and poetic phrases (i.e. The characters in the 1985 adaptation speak very differently than in the 2005 adaption, where they use modern language.) While the 2005 adaptation included Mrs. Flite saying, ""I will receive my judgement on the day of judgment,"" Mr. Crooks' ironic phrases are not well-explored in the 2005 adaptation.

4.
Additionally, this 1985 adaptation is more effective in showing just how poisonous Jardyce and Jarndyce is, and how the case poisons the lives of nearly everyone involved in the case. In the 2005 adaptation, I do not recall hearing any mention that the wards of Jardyce and Jarndyce are trapped in the case with no way to forfeit their claims.

5.
In short, I believe the 1985 adaptation does a better job than the 2005 adaptation culturally explaining the time period in light of the time period. (In some ways, this film reminds me of the the 1988 adaptation of Little Dorrit, especially in terms of using sunlight and darkness to convey emotions.)

Bottom Line:

The 2005 adaptation is excellent because of the acting and Davies' script, which tie the characters together wonderfully. The acting in this 1985 adaptation and the script are not nearly so brilliant. However, this film should keep the attention of someone who observes well through VISUAL rather than AUDIBLE methods. In short, the visual scenes of this 1985 adaptation tell the main story very well.  (Note: many subplots are excluded from this  1985 adaptation.) However, for the individual who loves well-written scripts that effectively tie together the many plots and subplots of Dickens' ""Bleak House"" in a fast-paced story, I believe the 2005 adaptation is the better choice. (Certainly, many more words are spoken in the 2005 adaptation than in the 1985 adaptation.)",1250985600,17,3673,5.199661590524535

Got this video just after finishing reading Bleak House.  Very disappointed in the video.  Some of Dickens most marvelous characters were cut entirely.  Normally I love Diana Rigg but I think she should have read the novel before playing this part.  And the gal playing Esther Summerson was all wrong. Esther is a character you have to love.  She is impossibly good but it works so well in the novel because she reveals her great sense of humor and her huge sense of humanity.  In the novel, there are chapters entitled ""Esther's Narrative"" wherein the reader gains great insight into who Esther is because she is speaking directly to the reader.  She even hints at future parts of her story, like when she mentions Allan Woodcourt but barely acknowledges his importance to her.  But Esther in this video is cold and humorless. And she does not narrate at all, which would have revealed so much more of her character.  When she is off-screen, you forget all about her.  From the production standpoint, there are bad edits throughout and ponderous direction.  Stick with the book, you'll have a much better time.",1246492800,13,1343,4.8034934497816595

For one thing, this version really has the look that is required of it: the gaslit smoky fog (or as we would call it today, smog) of the London scenes is spectacular, and you really feel as if (to quote Dickens) ""it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn-hill."" Krook's rag-and-bottle warehouse here is suitably like the massive and mysterious junkshop of an entire nation's accumulations, and the city graveyard where Nemo lies buried is horrifyingly bleak and rat-infested. Even the costumes and hairstyles are much more appropriately severe and mid-Victorian than in the prettified Davies version. Although this version does dispense with such beloved minor characters as the Turveydrops and the Jellybys (Peepy's absence here seems particularly regrettable), the focus on the main stories more than compensates, and the crucial roles of the haughty, haunted Lady Dedlock and the kindly John Jarndyce (Dickens's ideal adult man) are cast as ideally as possible, with the superlative Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliot (respectively). This is the best and most faithful filmed adaptation of BLEAK HOUSE.",1235174400,9,1389,5.233183856502242

319221,5,630104925X,"There is an excellent 2006 BBC version of BLEAK HOUSE, but the 1985 production is my favorite. I won't compare the two--other than to remark that each version ignores certain plotlines, while emphasizing others. The original story is quite involved, so you really can get away with making major cuts here & there for staging. I will say this, I believe the 1985 version is truer to the spirit of Charles Dickens--that is, comic, over the top characterization...and very compassionate.

At the center of the film is a famous probate/family court case in the London House of Chancery. The case has dragged on for years and at least one party has committed suicide over it, while others have been driven to madness & ruin. It also sparks a murder investigation in which practically everyone is a suspect. Some pretty bleak things indeed--except Dickens presents it all within a funny, satirical framework loaded with melodramatic situations--a literary fashion of the time.

As is often the case in Dickens' stories, the characters bear satirical names that explain their role in the plot. In this proto-crime show there are names like Lord & Lady Deadlock; money grubbers Mr. Krook & his pernacious relative Mr. Smallweed; the evil lawyer/solicitor Mr. Talkinghorn, the solicitor wannabe Mr. Guppy (small fish in a large pond)and so forth.

Some highlights:

Diana Riggs' outstanding performance as Lady Deadlock, a noblewoman with a dark & fatal secret to conceal.

The pathetic, homeless orphan, street-sweeper Joe, constantly harassed by the law to ""move on,"" but who has no place to move on to. In the end Joe becomes a sort of Christ figure. The (true) Christian spirit (or lack of it) is an important theme in BLEAK HOUSE. Before he succumbs to smallpox, the illiterate boy, who blames himself for exposing one of the heroines to his disease, begs that a billboard be made & with giant letters write on it the words, ""I'm sorry"" so she'll be sure to see it. The actor playing Joe is outstanding.

The element of forgiveness is central to BLEAK HOUSE--an element in most of his work. When the pompous Lord Deadlock rudely learns of his beloved wife's dishonor & disgrace, he suffers a severe stroke and becomes physically dependent on his housekeeper & her son (who treat him with kindness & gentle care.) Even though he is barely able to speak, he forces himself to request of them to ""find my lady"" and to tell her, ""All is forgiven...nothing changed or altered...all is forgiven.""

When Esther meets her mother for the first time, the guilt-ridden woman falls at the feet of her daughter saying, ""Forgive, forgive...please forgive.""

The cunning & slightly insipid Mr. Guppy also spiritually benefits from his association with the true Christian Esther. He realigns his priorities and matures from ""being on the make"" into a less selfish, upright man.

Another interesting thematic concept of the novel that is more evident in the 1985 version is the fact that it is women who most accurately reflect the Christian spirit, and it is the female characters who actively motivate the plot. This has some interesting implications.

Towards the end of the film, the ward & housekeeper Esther must go on a journey in search of her mother who is herself on a sort of Calvalry mission before she dies. Within the course of one evening, Esther experiences scenes of utter human desolation & despair that brought to mind the lighter transitional journey of Scrooge in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

Dickens lampoons the idle rich & the false religion of ""do gooders"" who preach to the poor, but seldom offer any real help or assistance to them. He often went on all night walks through London and interacted with the night people--and you can see the literary results in BLEAK HOUSE.

A final thought: BLEAK HOUSE the novel and both film versions has one of the saddest scenes in literature or drama. The poor, mad little Miss Flight keeps dozens of canaries in her squalid one room hovel. She herself is the product of a failed law case. She names her birds Sadness, Want, Decay, Envy, Greed. etc. She has placed her hopes in the eventual success of the two young wards of the central probate case--and, of course, names two of the birds accordingly. In the end she sees the destruction of these desperate dreams & she lets all her canaries fly away into the dingy London smog.

PS. Charles Dickens was a fascinating personality, a genius who could speak to all classes of society. Not only did he write wonderful novels, he very successfully performed them in 1-man shows in England, Continental Europe & the United States.

in this definitive set of episodes, the great queen of darkened drama, the avenging angel, the one and only dame diana rigg, she born of a noble and aristocratic face and voice, is a delicious marvel to watch. her face is a shielded mirror of the conflicting emotions whcih propel the plot. these conflicts grip her as she is challenged; its beauty shows in her progress of character in the classic dickensian way. in addition, denholm elliot shows a humanity filled with such warmth and kindness, it breaks the heart. as the story unfolds, it shows his hand with such a lovely gentleness.

his ward, the lovely ada, is played with a lightness and quiet that rarely is seen on today's screen. her sensitivity to her plight as an orphan, her contentedness and grace is a gift to the dvd.

in short, all of the characters are well-casted with the added benefit of a cinematographer who captures the rawness and cruelty that dicken's was obsessed with--the wealthy only owe their privilege to their birthright, whereas the poor are separated from a humanity which ought to be theirs only by injustice.

this version also speaks volumes as reagards the tuly evil and heinous creatures:  those religious hypocrites whose false spirituality condemns them by their unbelievable ignorance, sheer selfishness and cruelty.

319299,3,630104925X,"Civil Court, trial-lawyers and their lawyer-Judge pals string a young man along for years. The young man believes if he writes a clearer presentation, files one more paper; then the Court will be just. We watch the young man's health fall to ruin, his relationships with his wife, children and friends ruined, and the self-serving, crooked, trial-lawyers enriched. There is a humorous scene at the end, when the young man realizes he has believed liars, believed a self-serving Cartel of lawyers and lawyer-Judges. Thus, the Civil Court-house is the Bleak-house.

Mr. Dickens wrote Bleak House to expose the self-serving, corrupt, Cartel of trial-lawyers and lawyer-Judges. The other, 2005 version, written by lawyers, shows the main character's home with dark furnishings, filmed by candlelight, for a bleak home to confuse and defraud Mr. Dickens's true message.

There is also a murder-mystery plot; and a plot about man who extorts a woman with a secret. However, ""Bleak House"" will appeal most to someone who has been to Civil Court. This film is too slow.

Charles Dickens's ""Oliver Twist"" DVD's are excellent, because, before television, movies, or radio, every town in America and England performed plays. ""Oliver Twist"" was a popular play; every town did it. Each town improved upon their neighboring town's version for fifty years, until we have the polished version in DVD today. ""Bleak House"" also has some gems to be mined and polished, but no one has done it yet.

There were so many scenes that were too long by double and should have been cut. They had characters repeating themselves and I sat here saying, ""We get the point - move on already!""  It was really frustrating because there were sections that were so intriguing and I wanted to move on but then it would switch to another scene and drag that one out interminably. I slogged through because I know it is a great story but wow it was a tough run. I wish somebody would remake this one with good editing. It could literally be half the length and it would be so much better. In addition to the frustrating editing there were a lot of sections where a conversation referred back to a previous episode and I could not remember what the original conversation was because it was two hours earlier in the series and two days earlier in real time meaning my time. So the scriptwriter should have made clear references to what was being talked about. I also noticed the characters would be introduced without explaining who they were so I had to watch for a while to figure that out. If you really really love movies like this as I do you will be able to sit through it and appreciate its good points such as the acting and the overall story.
