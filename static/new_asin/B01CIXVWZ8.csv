7683505,5,B01CIXVWZ8,I'm really enjoying this series and find it very interesting.  I don't think viewers understand that it's a weekly series and new episode comes out every Wednesday.,1458691200,8,164,5.074074074074074
7683506,5,B01CIXVWZ8,Where are the rest of the episodes in this series?,1458604800,,50,4.1
7683507,5,B01CIXVWZ8,Comment about missing episodes is wrong.  A new episode is added every Monday.,1458518400,12,78,5.0
7683508,1,B01CIXVWZ8,"Incomplete video. This is a really good legal thriller set in Australia. It is a continuing story with each episode building to the next. Unfortunately, the Amazon release has only two episodes, omitting the last six episodes in the season. It just leaves you hamnging. Terrible quality control.",1458432000,3,295,5.166666666666667

7683510,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"I liked this series even though I don't know anything about the court system in Australia. It's slow like Vera and Brokenwood Myteries and you got to pay attention- will for me anyway. As for the seller,  I gave this rating for buying what was advertised and I got my package on time and it wasn't damaged.",1517616000,,306,4.368421052631579
7683511,5,B01CIXVWZ8,I simply like the actress Marta Dusseldorp.,1517356800,,43,5.285714285714286
7683512,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"I first became a fan of Marta Dusseldorp in A Place to Call Home and wanted to see what other work she has done. I decided to try out Janet King. I was not disappointed. Janet King (at least the first season, which I've seen) is a riveting and gritty legal drama that has a nuanced, multi-layered plot with numerous twists and turns. I was kept in perpetual suspense for the whole first season. Perhaps the one drawback I noticed is keeping track of all the characters and how they all relate to each other. There are a lot of them and this is not the kind of drama you can only pay half attention to; otherwise you might miss a critical element of the plot. I look forward to jumping into Season 2.",1516406400,,699,4.223880597014926
7683513,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"A captivating season involving an experienced prosecutor who is charged with a case involving police corruption, drugs and murder.",1516060800,,130,5.894736842105263
7683514,4,B01CIXVWZ8,"This is an Australian production that grew out of an earlier series called CROWNIES.  It is a bit darker and it is not a succession of self-contained episodes but rather an 8-hour miniseries with a single plot arc.  That plot becomes more and more complex as the series proceeds.  It begins with the arrest, trial and then death of a high-ranking police officer and then widens and becomes something more vast, more serious and more lethal.

Janet King is a senior attorney in the Sydney prosecution service.  She is part of an ensemble cast which includes her loveable but slightly disheveled boss, additional attorneys and legal researchers and the members of the police department with whom they work.  In her private life Janet has a gay partner and two children.  Her personal and professional lives become entangled in Series 1.

In general the scripts are strong, the plot interesting, the characters engaging.  This is not at the level of such British legal shows as Kavanagh QC or the top detective shows (Morse, Lewis, Endeavour, Frost, George Gently, Vera, Foyles War, et al.).  Nevertheless, it has good production values and viewers can turn to it when they have exhausted other possibilities.

Sydney plays a small role in the series.  We mostly see its traffic, taxis, and so on.  There are no establishing shots of the opera house, e.g.  In short, we could be anywhere (except for the fact that there are Aussie accents).

Worth a look.  Four stars.",1515888000,,1465,4.870445344129554
7683515,1,B01CIXVWZ8,I liked Marta in Jack Irish and A Place to Call Home but I do not like this series.,1512000000,,83,3.4210526315789473

7683517,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"Strong balanced yet feminine woman. Why can't the USA have that instead of simplistic one-dimensional characters: madonna, whore or a male role with a female ....so over the top.  Unfortunately, many men would feel threatened by this character as it challenges the again one-dimensional fantasy man portrayed by Hollywood.  Shame.",1506816000,,330,5.58
7683518,1,B01CIXVWZ8,Didn't get past the first episode. Dropping the 'f' bomb! It's a real shame Producers are so unsure of their work that they have to fill their shows with filthy language.,1505260800,4,170,4.516129032258065

7683528,1,B01CIXVWZ8,"Not a good show, they dragged one story out through the entire season.  It's long, boring, and does not show the police and justice system in a favorable light. I gave up and went to the last disk to find out who killed the person in the first disk. This is so good, we tossed it in the trash and will not by anymore.",1494028800,,317,3.953125

7683550,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"I was surprised at the depth the writers went into to develop the story for this season. It's so refreshing to have a legal drama with a steady build up per episode (unlike a lot of American dramas where it's a case PER episode). This show really kept me guessing and thirsty for more. It's also really nice to see more representation of the LGBTQ community in a lead role. If you're looking for drama, heartache, and smart story-telling, this is the show for you.",1490745600,,464,4.470588235294118

7683588,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"Although it is always a challenge to understand English, Irish and Australian accents, the acting and plots of these series about crime investigations and the resulting trials are well acted and produced.

7683590,3,B01CIXVWZ8,"We may be missing something here, but in Series One, there is a big deal made of ""phallic abnormalities"" a victim of child molestation makes about the perpetrator and that medical examination confirms. Then in court, the victim's brother suddenly says it was not the perpetrator but the woman's father, who was the molester. We sit through all that talk and nonsense and never is the former evidence, that allowed it to go to trial, mentioned. It is nigh impossible that the two men would have the same abnormalities. We like Dusseldorp but that seemed bad writing or maybe we are dull? Anyway, we have moved on to a new series.",1484697600,2,628,4.666666666666667

7683649,2,B01CIXVWZ8,"I like the characters for the most part, but the plots seem too unrealistic to me.  I'm familiar with both psychology and the law as disciplines and find the choices made by the writers too unbelievable - a drive by shooting in which a key witness is murdered and there is no police presence, either at the time of the shooting even though the witnesses life as no doubt been threatened?!  Giving complete immunity to a murderer if he were to testify against another murderer, who turns out not to be the actual murderer?  I need SOME connection to reality.",1479168000,6,557,4.55

The acting was excellent and the topic is certainly very applicable to our times even though this takes place on another continent you can see that these same events could easily happen here in the United States. I worked in the legal profession for many years and found that many of the interpersonal relationships were very similar in my world although of course the system works very differently.,1478649600,,436,4.986301369863014

7683677,4,B01CIXVWZ8,"This is an excellent series, featuring brilliant acting (Dusseldorp is, again, magnificent), solid writing, and fine directing.  The music is odd and intrusive, however.  The great issue facing all viewers is the matter of the heroine's lesbianism.  It is excessive and melodramatic, and brings the basic morality of the story into question.  It is apparently wonderful if a two lesbians raise twins and wholly evil for men to photograph youngsters on ogle them on the Internet.  Indeed, in Janet King almost all of the men are evil, and almost all of the women are good.  This point of view can become a problem.  Still, it's a great story and one never wants to miss a series on this intellectual level.",1477353600,,705,4.825

7683792,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"An Australian import that is more riveting than many American-made dramas, Janet King's story is as current as today's news and as timeless as the need for law and order. Marta Dusseldorp brings the title character to life with a sensitive portrayal of an ambitious prosecutor whose career and home life demand her full attention. Returning from maternity leave (twins!), Janet finds life at the office even more of a jungle, as a controversial, headline-grabbing case places her in the spotlight, and in jeopardy. Realistic dialogue and fast-paced plotting give this debut season of Janet King the feel of a theatrical suspense thriller. Viewers will be asking, what's next at nearly every turn. Janet's search for the truth in the case of a high profile police officer turn up more than a few enemies, eager to stab her in the back. The delicate balance of new motherhood, an all-consuming job and a partner (Aimee Pedersen plays Ashleigh Larsson) who veers between understanding and unhappy all keep Janet in constant motion, hoping to solve the case and keep her cool. Acorn's well-produced DVD set offers some nice behind-the-scenes bonus features, and overall, meeting Janet King will whet the appetites of viewers for another season, please.",1471478400,,1248,5.122549019607843

7683815,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"I've just finished watching JANET KING: The Enemy Within and thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I didn't know about the parent series CROWNIES,  so I wondered about some of the dialog in the first episode which alluded to things the viewer didn't know.  It really doesn't matter if you have seen CROWNIES, this series takes off and gives the viewer a look inside the judicial system in Australia, as well as the lives of the people involved.  One of the special features on this DVD says the view is from the courtroom, not from the point of view of the villain or the accused, but from those doing the prosecuting.  If you are a fan of good courtroom drama, I highly recommend this series.  Even though the series focuses on Janet King (Marta Dusseldorp)  a new mother of twins returning to work after her maternity leave, it is an ensemble cast, and the interaction among characters is another strong point.  These are educated and skilled professionals, but they are also human beings, and life gets in the way of work whether it is Janet's partner Ashe (Aimee Pederson) considering returning to her work rather than staying at home with the twins, or Lina having feelings of inadequacy because she cannot find the evidence for prosecution of a criminal that play along with her frustration at not being able to conceive with Andy.  The mystery in the series is solved over the course of the eight episode, and is well written and full of twists and turns.  The horror of child pornography, and the suspicion of corruption within the system add to the darkness which touches everyone.  Wonderful performances by all the cast, a good solid storyline, and education about the Australian court system make this a winner.",1467072000,9,1718,4.77027027027027

7683818,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"Janet King Series 1: The Enemy Within. This Australian television series is an extension of the popular series CROWNIES.  It is a courtroom drama/crime drama/mystery/thriller set in bustling current day Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Senior Crown Prosecutor Janet King (Marta Dusseldorp, A PLACE TO CALL HOME, JACK IRISH), who is in a lesbian relationship, returns from maternity leave determined to prove she still has her edge: she further proves herself still capable and gifted.  But King finds herself working in a different Department of Public Prosecutions, even more demanding than when she left. The Attorney General has insisted on a closer working relationship with police. Chief Superintendent Jack Rizzoli (Vince Colosimo, THE GREAT GATSBY) has taken an unnerving interest in prosecutions; he has strong convictions about the direction of the investigations, regularly challenges Kings authority. Cunning/ambitious newcomer Owen Mitchell (Damian Walshe-Howling, THE REEF), will bend rules to score a conviction.  Janet's first seemingly straightforward case escalates into a shocking murder; she is thrust into the spotlight on a controversial case involving a senior police officer. She is step by step propelled into a complex web of corruption and conspiracy that shakes the police, judiciary and government.  Dusseldorp here delivers an award-winning performance as a brilliant crownie struggling to balance life at home with her commitment to her job in this multifaceted courtroom drama.

The sophisticated scripts, by E Celine are first-rate, as is direction  by Grant Brown, Peter Andrikidis.  The tension is ratcheted up, the screws turned, until Kings situation is almost unbearable.  And the acting, ah, the acting, is uniformly superb. Colosimo presents with all Rizzolis rough edges intact. Deborah Kennedy, so memorable as the town crier in A PLACE TO CALL HOME, is Diane Vaslich. As the title character, Dusseldorp  is without peer.  She always plays intelligent, but she can run through most of the emotions as well.  She carries JANET KING manfully; has similarly carried A PLACE TO CALL HOME, co-carried, with Guy Pearce, JACK IRISH. In fact, I think she acts as well, if not better, than that trio of blond actresses about her age that Australia gave to Hollywood: Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, Naomi Watts. All of whom have become Queens there. And good luck, Australia, in keeping Dusseldorp down under.  Perhaps her odd name and the fact that she is beautiful without being pretty will help keep her in the land of Oz.

The episodes are:
1. A Song of Experience. As she returns from maternity leave, Janet King is assigned to prosecute a case involving police commissioner Steven Blakely, who is accused of giving his cancer-stricken wife a fatal dose of morphine.
2. Every Contact Leaves a Trace. King's heavy workload forces her to spend more time away from her family. Erin and Owen try to coax a reluctant witness to testify against a biker accused of murder. With no body or strong motive, the Blakely case stagnates until King's boss, Tony Gillies, pushes it to trial.
3. Natural Justice. Diane finally breaks down, makes a statement but does not admit guilt. A strange development in the Moreno case intertwines with Diane's involvement in the Blakely case. Erin deals with traumatic flashbacks,  deliberates whether to testify in court, which could put her life again in danger.
4. The Third Man. Andy questions Danny Novak after he is seen on surveillance arguing with Blakely on the day the cop  went missing. Richard takes it upon himself to look out for Danny's daughter, Tatum. Lina attends compulsory psychological counseling required for employees of the Department of Public Prosecutions.
5. Lurking Doubt. Media scandal sweeps through the department when King and Erin are accused of having an affair; the  Moreno case trial judge is brought in to investigate. After a terrifying experience, Ash and the babies must leave home for their safety
6. Overtime. King insists that Moreno is involved in Blakely's murder, but Andy urges her to be more prudent. So King focuses on Blakely's daughter, Maya, to gain more information about Moreno. Lina attempts to submit her resignation; Tony refuses to accept it.  Ash and the kids are still in hiding; King misses her family.
7. An Achilles Heal. A new body is found, adding complexity to the Blakely case. The crown attorneys try to convince Maya to testify against Nelson again in court. Lina and Andy struggle with fertility issues; Owen has a suspicious appointment.
8. The Greatest Good. Andy and Jack confront Blakely's son, who reveals startling information. Danny Novak is arrested and questioned. A new and volatile suspect materializes as King races to piece together the case, protect her family.

The box set, which I received in expectation of a fair and unbiased review, consists of two discs running approximately 474 minutes, for eight episodes.  It has subtitles of course, for those of us not accustomed to Oz-speak. As bonuses, it offers a behind-the-scene featurette (18 mins.) and a photo gallery. Be aware, the production contains strong language, violence, sexual situations and disturbing images.  Not for the faint of heart or families.  But I say to you, its a good thing all TV isn't  this good or I might never leave the house. Of course, we binge-watched to the ultimate degree  of our human ability. This entertainment has everything.",1466208000,2,5465,5.19226393629124

Yes, Janet King is the main character, but the show is so much more. The mystery which runs through the entire first season will keep you guessing.  Her home life adds warmth but does not interfere with legal work. Secondary characters bring just the right spice, making the show just fun to watch.  The casting, script and pacing are superb.  If you like legal dramas, this series gives an enthralling perspective of the Australian judicial system.

They do a really bad job of informing viewers, who are paying them by the way, of which shows will be shown with a new episode each week and the number of those episodes.  They also do not have an alphabetical search on their site or on Amazon.  You have to KNOW the name of the show before you can find it.  Bad deal since I like British shows obviously, but not the names.  Also, I was watching Trivia and was not informed that it was canceled.  No.  I had to search the internet for when the next season was or if there was one.

7683842,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"Janet King is an engrossing, intriguing court-room procedural imported from Oz which gives viewers an incisive view of the criminal cases while simultaneously highlighting the legal principles of the Australian criminal justice system. Janet King, the central character, is a 30-something senior crown prosecutor tackling the pressures of being a major case prosecutor just having returned from maternity leave after giving birth to twins. King's wife, Ashe, put her own career on hold to be the stay-at-home mom. Even though King's an alpha personality, the writers don't shy away from the moral dilemmas nor have they created a one-dimensional authoritarian character. One of her best lines comes from a heart to heart she's having with Ashe about raising their twins, ""...I want them to grow up learning about tolerance, forgiveness, acceptance, {While} (m)y whole job is about guilt and blame and punishment.""

There is much to admire about this constellation of artists!  Solid writers, warm, appealing characters, carefully researched yet multi-dimensional villains, Janet King is a prized find. We even get a look at the perennial tension between law enforcement and prosecutors.

My only complaint is that I felt dropped into the center of a group of people with obvious history since there were references to prior conflicts. I felt  a bit disconnected and out of touch.  Thanks to Google,  I  discovered there was an equally superb prequel called Crownies which boasts the same characters and artists and is available streamed through any of a number of outlets. I'm a avid admirer of international police and legal dramas, so I was delighted to discover that I could stream Crownies through a number of online sources. It's also available for purchase on ebay and amazon but BEWARE that your DVD or BLUE RAY player may not be compatible. (Your computer might be.)  Bottom line -  Janet King and Crownies are gripping and believable, largely due to outstanding performances by the entire cast.",1461974400,28,2003,5.214953271028038

Can someone please explain what happened with Danny Nowak--and Tatum and Richard's relationship...
It was pretty evident they had a romantic session in Crownies at some point which I don't remember seeing at all because JK opens with their meeting and being very touchy with each other and while they seemed to still care for each other never really got back into relationship...

7683845,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"Janet King is an Australian TV series featuring a Senior Crown Prosecutor, Janet King. She is played by Marta Dusseldorp, and she has been featured in several tv series. In this series she is the main lead, playing a gay prosecutor, just returning from maternity leave after giving birth to twins. Her partner, Ashe, is a stay at  home mom, but she is feeling boxed in and wants to return to work.

Janet King is given a case that belonged to another prosecutor, and now she has 20 mins before the first courtroom appearance. This tv series has 8 episodes in the first season, and they are jam packed with action. The issue is a man of the law found murdered under mysterious circumstances. There is a hinted history of some new barristers trying to solve the cases that the police were unable to solve. Never mind that these prosecutors do not have enough time to do their real job. This seems overdone, but when I think about other legal series the same issues appeared- solve the case before you prosecute. The other lawyers are well characterized and very interesting people. There are areas where these young lawyers are allowed to stumble, and we are there with them.  The families are showcased. The life of a gay prosecutor and her home life is not easy, and in Australia doubly so.

A new series that grabbed me at the start. Excellent writing and the acting is superb. I understand there is a season 2, and I look forward to that series.

When I finished episode 7, I was perturbed to find that they left me hanging - obviously not the end of the series. After some Google searches, I finally ran across the news that Acorn was adding one new episode each Monday. Great news - I'll get to see the entire season, eventually. Bad news - HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PLAN TO RELEASE ONE EPISODE EACH WEEK????  Yes, I'm shouting at Amazon and Acorn. Nowhere on my Acorn or Amazon Prime subscription was there any indication that this was being released piecemeal. It looks like at least half the reviews on Amazon are complaints about the ""missing episodes"". If this was clearly stated somewhere for subscribers to see, there would be a lot fewer people pissed off at Amazon and Acorn right now.",1461196800,12,1206,4.527522935779817
7683860,4,B01CIXVWZ8,Just finished watching 7 episodes on Acorn. Cant get any more. Why? Appears others have complained about this too!,1461110400,2,114,5.052631578947368
7683861,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"UPDATE: I was c.r.a.n.k.y. about not being bale to watch episodes 7 & 8!!! And now...blammo, Ep 7 is there, and a comment-or left note that 8 will be there soon.

So it seems this is (as well, I noticed, as Vera's latest season) is run more like a Season Pass rather than getting the full season at once.

While although Season Pass usually puts up the latest episode after midnight the day it airs or something like that, and though this show is in S2 in Australia so all the episodes for S1 should already be available, it's an Acorn subscription based program - so, keep them wanting more I guess makes you wait for the next episode.

The point is, now it's there...so then...YAY for the whole thing because the acting is great, the suspense is strong, and wanting to follow the characters through a whole season is definitely top notch because of the writing and acting.

I left the original that I wrote below:

Love the series but pissed at Acorn Media and Amazon - there are 2 episodes of season 1 missing from the US version of this. You can't stream the video for those two last episodes unless you're in Australia. WTF? Really pisses me off - I'd purchase it but you can't in the US...and the DVD set isn't available in the US until June. Really? After 6 episodes, it just abruptly stops - and not to have the last two of S1 is really frustrating. If you want to know what happens you have to go to Wiki and get the episode details, but again, WTF I could have done that with the whole series if I wanted to read it. Not cool Amazon - not cool, Acorn.",1460764800,3,1579,4.324324324324325
7683862,3,B01CIXVWZ8,"Airing from down under is Australian television show Janet King, now streaming on Acorn TV through my Amazon subscription. Marta Dusseldorp, when not filming A Place to Call Home, plays a prosecutor.  After returning from maternity leave, having twins with her partner, she is thrown back into work and struggles to adjust.

Apparently the term for one in her position is a crownie.  No shes not drinking a king of beer or eating a baked good.  Crownies are solicitors who get to wear those funny wigs in court like they do in the U.K.  Frankly, as a U.S. citizen, I really think the attorneys in the states should wear wigs just to humble them a bit.  Can you imagine Perry Mason going to court with a wig on his head?  Well, maybe not.

The series focuses on a controversial case involving a senior ranking police officer and the corruption that is ripe within the judicial system and police involving child pornography. It is filled with court scenes, office politics, political bullies, gay prejudice, criminals, and victims.  I should warn you, however, that the story about child pornography can be disturbing as well as child sexual abuse. Its not for the faint of heart.  However, as Janet King digs deeper into the mire and uncovers the truth, it stirs up a bees nest of nastiness and danger.

I wouldnt say that the show is as gripping as some others, on the other hand I wouldnt put it on the shelf and bypass it either.  You may find it intriguing as the layers are peeled back and the culprits are revealed in this sad story of exploited children. Unfortunately, I do think they overstep the boundaries of the subject by showing pictures of children semi-dressed found on a porn website and also a voice clip of a man sexually abusing a child and the little girls reaction. If youve ever experienced the horror of being violated as a young girl, this could very well trigger a response. Be careful.

As usual, the down under accents are comforting to my American ears, mate.  Its worth the watch if you're into this type of office politics, legal mumbo jumbo, and court drama.",1460678400,4,2089,4.641304347826087

My only beef is that there should be 7, not 6 episodes available as of today's date. I don't know if this is an Amazon or an Acorn thing, but it's annoying.",1460419200,5,408,4.311688311688312

I'll probably stick it out to the end of the series but I find myself becoming more irritated with each new episode.

28 April: It doesn't get any better. Acting on the whole remains dreadful, direction inept. The one saving virtue, if it can be called that, is that it is reasonably well photographed.",1460160000,6,491,5.061728395061729

This was not stated by Amazon on the program info page, which is disappointing. I'm left hanging. Series 1 (all 8 episodes) will be released on DVD on 2016/06/17.

8753135,5,B01CIXVWZ8,"Intense.
That's a word that shouldn't be thrown around lightly but in this case I feel that it's more than appropriate in describing this excellent Australian crime drama. Simply put, ""Janet King: The Enemy Within"" is a very well written, complex story that focuses on a number of social issues ranging from malfeasance in office to the often too cozy relationship between police and judges; from the hard choices parents must make when raising children to the difficulties women often face in the workplace where they are seldom taken seriously despite their education and experience.
And it asks the question, just how many rules should law enforcement bend or break in pursuit of ""the greater good.""
An excellent cast led by veteran actor Marta Dusseldorp does justice to some really fine writing throughout the series and the direction is smooth. The pacing of each episode is such that viewers have a real opportunity to invest in the characters and their struggles as King, a crown prosecutor, attempts to figure out what's going on after a senior police official who has been charged with a crime is murdered.
The verdict, your honor, is that ""Janet King: The Enemy Within"" is guilty of being an excellent series.",1528070400,,1220,4.95609756097561
