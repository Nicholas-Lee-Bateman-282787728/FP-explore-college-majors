7830976,2,6302770602,"The Grand Duel, 1972 film

A man drives a stagecoach with passengers into a town. One man gets out. Armed men watch him as he walks toward a house under siege. The talk tells about the story and characters. Suddenly a man runs out of the house and escapes being shot. [Incredible acrobatic feats?] The Sheriff doesn't kill for money. There is a shooting and a surprise getaway. A chase on horses for action. He went that-a-way? The stagecoach continues on its journey. It picks up a passenger whose horse died. They reach the town of ""Silver Bell"". [This is funny in parts.] Two men play checkers with shot glasses for pieces. Another pair plays poker. Clayton speaks but remains aware. A trap sets off a pistol when the door is opened. The bounty hunters besiege the cabin. Clayton knows who killed old man Saxon. There is more shooting as the wanted man goes outside. A double-cross to avoid sharing the loot? ""Don't' count your chickens before they are hatched.""

The bounty hunters torture their prisoner to get him to tell where the silver is hidden. An old man is thrown into the street by the Saxon brothers, then shot. The people clap their shoes in protest. [Some foreign custom?] The stagecoach arrives in Saxon City. Clayton tells Marshal Saxon about the murder. The Saxon brothers run this town. Two more men fall to gunshots. A new bride arrives to marry a Saxon brother. [Comedy?] Who killed the patriarch? Philip Premier was convicted of the murder. Outside two more men fall to gunshots. Clayton talks to the head of the Saxon brothers. Outside men shoot at each other. There is a halt, then more gunfire. Philip is captured. David Saxon boasts of ""law and order"". When the Saxons get that silver they can dominate the state. ""Never ask me that question again!"" Clayton addresses the crowd in front of the gallows. He tells who was the murderer! ""What's his name?""

Will there be a duel between Clayton and the Saxon brothers? Is three against one fair odds? Only one man is left standing. Will Philip find love at the end? Will justice triumph? Do some people reveal their true character at the end? Will you ever watch this movie again?

This is like some ersatz western where bits of famous movies were patched together to provide a story of the Old West as seen by a European. It is funny in a few scenes. One authentic part is the realism in the costumes. People don't look as if they just stepped out of a clothing store with new clothes that remain dust-free in all the scenes.",1435363200,,2500,4.598654708520179
7830977,4,6302770602,"I recently received this video and was gratified to find it was widescreen.  Unfortunately it was recorded in the ep mode from a well-used master which had an occasional line running though it. Surprisingly this  didn't detract; many times when viewing the originals at drive-ins in the  60s and 70s, the copies of the movies were well worn, so this was like a  time machine.  The movie itself is a good example of the genre; Santi was  Leone's assistant on GBU and OUATIW, and the influence is obvious.  Highly  recommended, if your vcr can handle ep mode.",947548800,,557,4.670103092783505
7830978,4,6302770602,"This is a rare treat for Lee Van Cleef fans!  A widescreen version of The Grand Duel, and it's the unrated version as well.  It is far superior to the horrible pan scan version previously released.
A welcome addition to  any Western or Lee Van Cleef collection!",924134400,4,261,4.51063829787234
