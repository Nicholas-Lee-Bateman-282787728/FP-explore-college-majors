6807004,5,B00PHIK8NY,"I got this direct from the folks who produced the documentary, and it was much better than I had imagined, the story of United States motorcycle mud-rider John Penton goes back to when his grandfather made machined parts for Henry Ford's prototype cars in the midwest, as they were neighbors.  It is narrated by Lyle Lovett (the country singer) who happens to love the Penton motorcycles which started in production in 1968.  The Penton brand name was removed from the dirt bikes by the Austrian moped manufacturer KTM that produced them for John Penton at some point in the 1970s.  The story moves along at a quick pace with interviews of John Penton, racers, KTM staffers, family members, and contacts John Penton had made throughout his life.  The skill at which Director Todd Huffman weaved the documentary together is uncanny.  Using old photographs, videos from different eras including considerable ISDT(International Six Day Trial)video footage, is totally captivating. The documentary describes how the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers entered the off-road motorcycle business and simply bulldozed thru the small European manufacturers.  Filled with inspirational stories and tragedies, this jumped to the top of my list of must-see films on motorcycles. Steve McQueen, an actor famous for his escape riding of a german motorcycle cross country in the movie ""The Great Escape"" was a one time ISDT competitor at the ISDT...failing TO finish.  John Penton himself never actually won a Gold Medal, despite his many attempts over the years.  He is now 88 years old, and can still ride a dirt bike off road.

John Penton was a driven man, and before he was involved in the Penton motorcycle, he held a 10 year long record for riding solo from NYC to Los Angeles with BMW, with only an hour's sleep on the side of the road in Flagstaff.  He developed a passion for the International Six Days Trial - a six day long motorcycle endurance event that has been in existence primarily in Europe since 1913.  It was held annually and each of 35-45 countries sends a team of their best off-road riders to compete as a demonstration of which motorcycle manufacturer is the most reliable.  John Penton's obsession/dream was that the USA could assemble a team of riders that could beat the best in the world, usually the ISDT elite 6-man Trophy Team competition is won by East Germans, Italians, West Germans, Sweden or Finland, Czechoslovakia, France, or Great Britain but never the USA. The 6-days requires that certain components on the bike cannot be changed, nor even removed for repair as some are sealed together with wire and crimped with a special tool, marked with special paint, and parked in a fenced off ""parc ferme"" overnight so that no one can work on them.  Each morning the rider has a mere ten minutes to fix problems, and then off he goes on a 6-10 hour day thru the toughest terrain the host country has to offer.  To be competitive in the ISDT, the rider must be not only a fast rider with the best of judgement in reading the terrain, but an excellent mechanic who can improvise repairs when needed, ride with injuries, change a tire in under 5 minutes, and all using only the tools he carries during the event.

Penton had 3 sons: Tom, Jeff, and Jack, who all became top riders with a never-say-die attitude similar to their father, who could rise to the need if the trail pace was very fast, could make repairs incredibly quickly, change flat tires or swap for fresh ones in under 5 minutes, and generally became model riders for other Americans who also aspired to compete on the US Team that travelled to the ISDT.  Year after year, Penton would assemble a team for the ISDT, and always something would go wrong.  One year silicone seal inside an air intake box loosened up and clogged a carb, another year excessive exhaust silencer material caught fire and the bike burned on the first day. Another time the USA tried a mixture of manufacturers to put together a blended trophy team, and the most reliable marque - a KTM, had engine failure, while the marque that was most expected to fail became top American Trophy team rider.

The Penton motorcycle, which became a ""KTM"" motorcycle, eventually reached a point where the KTM was the most popular choice of ISDT bikes for competitors in the ISDT world.  Eventually the ISDT became known as the ISDE because it was more of an Enduro than a Trial. Many books and movies have been released on the ISDT or ISDE, but none show it from this perspective.  It offers the behind the scenes detail that would have been lost forever had it not been compiled and presented in this wonderful format.  The Blu-Ray version of DVD is highly recommended for the better detailed video work, if you can play a Blu-Ray DVD.

The life lesson many of John Penton's riders learned was that you can push yourself much further than you had ever imagined, you are capable of so much more than you think... it is all a matter of motivation.",1418774400,11,4985,4.752027809965237
6807005,5,B00PHIK8NY,Excellent video if you want to know the history of Penton and how KTM basically pushed John Penton out of the motorcycle business. Great historical piece.

This excellent movie stirred great memories of those days of my youth and transported me back to a time when riding in the woods was what I lived to do. After seeing this movie, I am in awe of the man behind the machines I lusted after but never could quite afford. So very glad I found this movie.",1458000000,,433,4.3580246913580245

6807053,5,B00PHIK8NY,"Would highly recommend this movie to any vintage dirt bike history buff!!! I loved the story, and this documentary is excellently done with superb video, exceptional reenactments, and just enough actual video footage from ""back in the day"" to give the viewer as strong feeling of what it was like to ride those vintage machines. I am old enough to say I rode dirt bikes in the Southern California deserts and mountains in the late 1960s and continue to enjoy the Southwest deserts and mountains to this day via dirt bike, quad, Jeep and dune buggy. This movie conveys way more than just a story about the Penton dirt bikes, rather it is the life history of John Penton in a manner that leaves the viewer with a sense of John's personal fortitude and lifestyle that made him the successful entrepreneur that he is.
