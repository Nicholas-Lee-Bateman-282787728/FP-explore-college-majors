8611868,5,B00F37VHSO,"I use this for demo-ing my system, Chapter 2 is spectacular in every way.
Picture is amazing, detailed, bright and colorful.
The content is outrageous, from the young men performing truly death defying runs to the Helicopter pilots dizzying skills you can't take your eyes off of the images on screen.
it's also note worthy to me to see what goes into making such a film, the behind the scenes Action ( or non action ) with these adrenaline junkies is  thought provoking to say it kindly.
Great Picture, great sound, intriguing content all you could want in a AV highlight demo disc.",1403222400,,583,4.660194174757281
