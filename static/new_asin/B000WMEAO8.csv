It is not a how-to video, nor is it about seeing artists demo their favorite techniques. Instead ... it is like sitting down on a porch swing or visiting an artist's studio and having a wonderful conversation ... filled with stories, struggles, insights and ideas about the creative process.

Yes, the artists do talk about technique ... but the real gems are hidden in those casual asides ... like Jennifer Louden's (author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Woman-s-Comfort-Book-A-Self-Nurturing-Guide-for-Restoring-Balance-in-Your-Life/dp/0062505319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Woman's Comfort Book: A Self-Nurturing Guide for Restoring Balance in Your Life</a>) comment about learning as an artist to live with the ugliness we create, the importance of finding and following your own voice, and how to nurture the soul of an idea -- delivered in its original spark. In this 5th issue, the interviews with the staff at Stampington & Company (the publishers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somerset-Studio/dp/B00006KXHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somerset Studio</a>&nbsp;and more) on the surface are about how to submit and get published in their magazine. But ... if you watch it again, you can see that what you actually are getting is a rare peak into the process of creating visual resources that inspire. And seeing how they do it gives lots of clues to artists who seek to create inspiring works of art.

This was the first issue I purchased. Maybe it was just right timing ... that every interview gave me something I needed to hear. And every time I watch it, something else pops out that deals with some creative challenge I am having. So the DVD has paid for itself several times over ... not just in the ideas it contains, but in bringing to light artists I probably would not have found on my own.

So, who would I recommend this DVD to? Anyone who loves chatting with artists or visiting artist's studios will like this DVD. Anyone who needs a gentle source of inspiration, an inspiring reminder that successful working artists do, indeed, exist or dreams of getting published in a Somerset magazine will treasure it.",1200009600,2,2328,5.570621468926554
8224116,1,B000WMEAO8,"If you are an artist don't bother.  I thought this was a great idea, and maybe in a year or so it will be.  However, on the two Indie Arts DVD's I reviewed.  There is lots of talk and little action.  I was very disappointed from a visual standpoint.",1195948800,,249,4.020408163265306
