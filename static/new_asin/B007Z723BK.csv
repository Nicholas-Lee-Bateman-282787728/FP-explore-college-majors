8523301,3,B007Z723BK,"I love this series of trailers, but there's two problems with this particular one: 1. When I select play all, the movies from the first page of select a trailer keeps coming back to the menu after playing that trailer. By the time you select the 2nd page, it does continue uninterrupted (It may be just a glitch on my disc alone, but watch for that hiccup). 2. An Italian western about 3 ""supermen"" in the old west gets played twice in separate parts of the series (once in Italian & once in English). But if you can get beyond these 2, you will have another enjoyable addition to the series, which I will continue to collect as much as I can.",1374278400,,643,4.278688524590164
8523302,3,B007Z723BK,"I cannot believe some of these films even exist! The trampoline jumping supermen, the ridiculous costumes, it has to be seen to be believed!

I agree with the reviewer about the video quality not being on par with the previous releases, it looks more like a VHS to DVD transfer for the most part, but i'm still glad i got it for the laughs.",1349222400,,340,4.3125

8523304,1,B007Z723BK,"I love trailer collections, but this is one I regret coming within ten feet of. I own well over a 1000 DVDs and I've never come across one as atrocious as this.

Taking aside the poor navigation and random selection of trailers - which stray way off topic to include Spaghetti Westerns and even title sequence dumped onto it's running time - it's the quality of the material that really takes the cake.

Anyone who has bought trailer comps in the past, whether from Something Weird video or the Synapse 42nd Street series will be used to battered up prints - that's not the problem here. No, the problem is, the makers of Fantastic Movie Trailers 11 - Hero Trash have got the bare-faced cheek to have downloaded the entire discs content from YOUTUBE!!

That's right - if heavily pixelated 240px or 340px videos blown up onto your TV screen in all their barely legible blocky glory float your boat you've found your dream DVD. That's not all - because the conversion rate for Youtube videos is around 30fps on average, these trailers are chock full of missing frames as the blocky low res figures judder and jump all over the screen.

The audacity of the producers to feel this incredibly low-res DVD is fit for release when even the most charitable of purchasers would find it a complete rip-off is beyond me.

I was thinking of sampling the other releases from the Fantastic Movie Trailer series, but I'll be sending this DVD back for a refund and never going near the titles again.",1349049600,8,1483,4.6022727272727275
