8003208,5,B0000ULZR2,"Simply pleasure is delivered with this DVD.

No noise, no traditional for British popular music bad language, but melodies in the best tradition of Boney M's tunes easily entering and embracing the viewer never before seen a ""Blue"", but having their music heard on a way.

It definitely became one of my favorite music DVD mostly for extras more explicitly highlighting singers' potential and abilities than a 35-minute Riverside concert alive if even performance was accompanied by hysterical teen-girl funs.

Some complicity of navigation between DVD segments just add to the ""Blue""- related expectations.",1189123200,,607,5.4361702127659575
