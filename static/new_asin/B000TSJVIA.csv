2909744,5,B000TSJVIA,"A few months ago Glen Campbell released a fabulous new CD (Meet Glen Campbell) with current rock songs done ""the Glen way"". (See my review elsewhere on Amazon).

Now the folks at Time-Life have released a single DVD of performances from Campbell's 1960s TV show. What a delightful hour! (It apparently also aired in public TV stations during the year but never appeared in my local market.).
Similar to the great 2-DVD set which Sony released of the ""Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show"", this set focuses on duets which Campbell did during the show's run. There's Glen and Roger Miller, Glen and a very young Linda Ronstadt, and, yes, Glen and Johnny Cash!  The duet with Cher is priceless (on an old Sonny & Cher version of Bob Dylan's ""All I Really Wanna Do"". And there is very little available footage of Willie Nelson with his short hair (and jacket and tie!).

New video of Glen introducing each performance is a great idea and, as a bonus, there is a 15-minute interview with him (where he has his guitar handy to demonstrate a few of the answers he gives). The 72-year-old Campbell still looks great!

The Good Times Hour was produced by Tom Smothers (of the Smothers Brothers) and he give the show an edge in the comedy writing and direction.

It's a shame there is only an hour of material here. There must be so much more in the Campbell-owned archive. We can only hope for a Volume 2 (and 3? And 4?). The quality of the print is great too!

If you own the Cash TV show DVD, grab this one to put next to it on your DVD shelf.

2909745,5,B000TSJVIA,"What memories The Goodtime Hour brought back.  Who do we write to to get all the shows released on DVD?  I am reliving my younger years.  Glen is such a talented performer and I remember some of the funny comedy skits with the guest stars.  I was not disappointed with the DVD.  I even remember the cute guy, Larry McNeely, who sat next to Glen on the bench when Glen sang all of his hits.  Glen's present day comments show that he is just a down to earth guy and has not let stardom go to his head.  Calling B.J. Thomas a turkey for his song beating ""True Grit"" at the Oscars.  I personally thought the lyrics in ""True Grit"" made more sense than ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"".
All fans of ""The Goodtime Hour"" need to unite and have Glen make sure all of his ""Goodtime Hour"" shows are released.  I will be waiting for more of his shows!!!",1214784000,9,844,4.192546583850931
2909746,4,B000TSJVIA,"There are no serious disappointments on this DVD: It's a collection of solos and duets from one of the best 60s/70s variety shows on TV.

Campbell introduces each song with his memories and insights about the artists or songs; his deliveries are sincere and interesting.

One of the nicest things about this DVD is that each song is complete; there is no editing, no cutting off of the songs, no voice-overs.

I feel the best duet was with Linda Ronstadt; the best solo was Campbell's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix."" Ronstadt provided a strong balance to Glen's sometimes overpowering vocals (as when he completely drowned out the duet with BJ Thomas). ""Phoenix"" was sensitive, superb.

I'm deducting one star because the viewer is sometimes toyed with, as when Campbell talks about John Wayne. I expected to see some footage of Wayne, but no, it was just a rather irrelevant introduction to Campbell's solo of ""True Grit.""

The bonus content could have been better. It is only a series of mildly interesting questions and responses; trivia, memories. No footage, no songs.

As others have stated, this DVD leaves us hungry for the complete shows. Still, it's highly recommended entertainment in the absence of those shows.

UPDATED 3Nov2014: A lot of people might not know about the two-hour DVD that is included in Campbell's limited edition, ""American Treasure"" CD+DVD set (ASIN: B00FD9VNEU). I just posted a review of that set. The DVD contains even more of the Goodtime Hour's music and comedy skits, not seen on the DVD set here. It also includes an autographed painting lithograph of Glen Campbell, who personally signed all of them.",1211241600,4,1640,4.920289855072464
2909747,5,B000TSJVIA,This is a true classic! Seeing segments of Glen's Variety show is so cool the quality is quite good for it's age no matter what anyone says. Buy this DVD!!!!!!,1201219200,3,159,4.333333333333333
2909748,5,B000TSJVIA,"This is really a good dvd with the stars of early 70`s.
Videos are probably a little longer tham showed on tv in the 70`s.
You will see Roger Miller commenting the funny way they hide the michrophone.
Willie Nelson before he got ponytails.
Good music,recommended for country music lovers. Buy this and have a cold beer ready when it arrives.",1195603200,4,341,4.60655737704918
2909749,5,B000TSJVIA,"If you're old enough to remember the Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour on late 60s/early 70s prime-time television, you won't want to miss this.  The musical clips are a combination of duets (with the likes of Rick Nelson, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Anne Murray & Ray Charles) and solo efforts.  Colour and sound throughout are both excellent, as are the performances.  It's enough to make you yearn for the days of prime-time television variety.",1194048000,23,441,5.013698630136986
2909750,5,B000TSJVIA,"The new released DVD of the ""Glen Campbell Goodtimes Again"" is absolutely MAGICAL! Brought back a lot of memories from when I watched the program every week as a kid! The quality is Digitally Remastered and it has the best picture ever released. The 60 minutes on here goes very fast and doesn't have nearly what should have been released which is a BOXED set or something else close to that as Glen was on for 3 years--makes sense to release ALL the shows/skits. But, this Good Times Again is fabulous and thanks Glen for bringing back some terrific memories for me. I hope in the future that Time/Life will release some more.",1192579200,10,627,4.557522123893805
2909751,5,B000TSJVIA,"Just recieved this and it is just fantastic! To have up to date interviews with Glen about the show is the icing on the cake. The only drawback is tht is so short! Please Glen release the full shows.
Glen you are the best man!",1192233600,6,226,4.044444444444444
2909752,4,B000TSJVIA,"This is a fabulous hour well spent enjoying some terrific songs and performances and Glen (in current day interviews) intros many of the songs.
The other reviewer moaned about what ISN'T on this DVD....but frankly..for $15 I feel I got a LOT more than my monies worth and I will watch this over and over....goodness. Glen could sure play guitar and his guests?  The Ricky Nelson clip alone is wonderful...and that leaves Ray Charles, Willie Nelson , Roger Miller,  Ann Murray, Cher, Linda Ronstadt, The Smothers Brothers, BJ Thomas,  Johnny  Cash and lets not forget the late great writer of ""Gentle On  My Mind"" John  Hartford....doesn't sound like much to complain about...and I'm not....this is wonderful.",1191542400,44,708,5.060344827586207
2909763,4,B000TSJVIA,"I loved the DVD.  It was really great.  Although it lived up to its description  on your website,  I was still  disappointed because  I was really looking for a DVD of the entire shows that were originally  shown on TV.  I can't find it anywhere, so I assume that the network has  decided not  to put the show  on DVD yet.",1359849600,5,322,4.114754098360656
2909764,5,B000TSJVIA,"My husband and I remembered the Glen Campbell Good Time Hour on television and
watching the DVD collection of memorable shows was a pleasant reminder of simplier

2909765,5,B000TSJVIA,"This is a must have for not only fans of Glen Campbell, like myself, but for all Americans who desire to harken back to a simpler time.  The TV series ran from 1969-1972 (I was nine years old in 1969) during a time of extreme polarization in the country due to race and the Vietnam war.  With the hippies on one side and Richard Nixon on the other, what people probably forget is that there was a vast swath of Americans whose lifestyle and interests were not part of this divisiveness and they are represented by Glen Campbell's music and his audience.  For me, it is pure joy to watch the performances and audience's own joy in listening to the same.  Campbell's music and audience represent an America without anger or hatred.  It was all about the music and touching people's hearts with simple songs that rang true - songs that appealed to what makes us more alike than more apart - that is sadly missing today.  The performances are supplemented with Glenn's contemporary commentary where he shares his historical observations of the songs and songwriters that made his career.  For me, the most poignant of them is the song he saved for last - Gentle On My Mind.  Written by John Hartford, it opens with the lines...""It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk that makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch...""  On the other hand, hearing Glenn admit that he lost out on an Academy award for True Grit to B.J. Thomas in 1969 because Rain Drops Are Falling on Your Head was a better song was refreshingly candid and exposed his competitiveness.  Every track on this DVD is worth listening to over and over.  Sunday nights in America will never be the same I am afraid.  Lastly, please keep Glen in your prayers as he winds up his Goodbye Tour (75 years old), with his family as his backing band, and fights his battle with Alzheimer's disease.",1333065600,8,1916,4.521739130434782
2909766,5,B000TSJVIA,"This magnificant dvd brings back the magic of the great variety programs of the 1960's. Glens 'Good Time Hour' showcased the best talent of the era. Stunning performances of Ray Charles, Willie Nelson and Bobbie Gentry. The only flawed performance in the entire set is Anne Murray who seems to be competing with Glen for lead vocal. Beautiful Bobbie Gentry on the other hand blends in like butter. The Tommy Smothers skit still funny as ever after 40 years. Glen had it all, Best writers, best performing artists and above all Glens perfect personality for the variety show genere.",1318118400,3,581,4.878787878787879
2909767,5,B000TSJVIA,"GOOD TIMES - AGAIN,  YES! The worst thing I can say about this video is that it was too short.
More shows would truly be appreciated.",1308268800,2,133,4.115384615384615
2909768,5,B000TSJVIA,"This DVD is awesome - I have just viewed it for the first time after following Glen's career for many many years. Songsters........... I've heard most of them and surely the man from Delight, Arkansas is right up there with the VERY best of 'em :) for me the DVD highlite is Cryin' Time with Ray Charles.",1279843200,3,304,4.350877192982456

2909770,5,B000TSJVIA,"I enjoyed this a lot.
Collection of the best performances from the TV show aired long ago.

I wish to see a sequel of this",1274572800,2,192,3.948717948717949
2909771,5,B000TSJVIA,"This is an excellent DVD. I have watched it over and over again, reliving the late 1960s and my youth. A very young Linda Ronstadt and Anne Murray. Besides Glen himself of course. Glen's duets with Bobbi Gentry, and then Ray Charles, are very entertaining. I highly recommend this DVD. You will not be disappointed. I do hope another volume comes available in the future.",1268179200,4,371,4.723076923076923
2909772,5,B000TSJVIA,"I'm happy this DVD is SHORT - only great music is on it.  All of the fluff from the show has been edited out. What you get is Glen Campbell at his early best and some of the most memorable duets from his old CBS show.

The highlight for me was the young Anne Murray, who is simply perfect in her duet. Her voice soars and she and Glen are really insync. Others I liked best were Ray Charles, Linda Ronstadt and Bobbie Gentry. Even Cher comes off well believe it or not.

If there are more of these Glen Campbell DVDs - please not the whole program from start to finish, only the music.  I could also do without Campbell's commentary. Can't viewers be trusted to watch a program without an explanation?",1250380800,5,701,4.2481203007518795

8210784,3,B000TSJVIA,This is a dvd of some of the solo performances by Glen on his t.v show The Good Time Hour.  Galveston is my favorite of those.  Although I like all of his solo songs better then his duets with some of the guests on the show.  He does  Folsom Prison Blues with Johnny Cash.  They were probably the two biggest singers in the world at the time.  And as big as Cash was.  Glen was bigger.  Glen and Bobbie Gentry made an album together and you can see their chemistry.  I do agree that they should release the entire series of The Good Time Hour on dvd.,1503100800,,550,4.065420560747664
8210785,5,B000TSJVIA,Brought back great memories of Glen and his great musical cohorts.  Really enjoyed this!,1491436800,2,88,5.285714285714286
8210786,5,B000TSJVIA,"We thought the DVD was very well done.  Great to see the outstanding performers of that time period  singing with Glen and perhaps a time when families could really enjoy together the simplicity of good music.  Glen talks about the program being a Variety Show and we feel it's a very good one.

Five stars from us.
