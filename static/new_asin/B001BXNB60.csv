8285086,5,B001BXNB60,"This film is part mystery and part political memoir. It starts in 2001 shortly after the terrorist attack against the Twin Towers in New York City. Suddenly grinning yellow cat graffiti began appearing all over Paris. Chris Marker engages in a treasure hunt for the grinning yellow cats and engages in a discussion of the politics of France during the period. It's an odd mixture, but it works. Some of the grinning yellow cats are drawn with paws outstretched as if to say ""I have a hug for you!"" to the viewer. One wonders if the grinning yellow cats, obviously inspired by Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat, are a political protest of some sort. Sure enough, they do eventually show up in street demonstrations. They even show up in French post office stamps. I think the artist of these cats should be declared a French national treasure. The mystery of who the artist is was solved three years after the copyright date of this film. ""Mr. Cat"" was caught in the act in March of 2007. He was arrested and got a 300 euro fine. Well at least the French were lenient. Graffiti artists have gotten far worse in the United States. He now makes a living from his art. If you want to know more you can google ""Mister Cat graffiti: from Paris to Sarajevo.""",1402185600,3,1246,4.542222222222223
8285087,5,B001BXNB60,"We are also presented with other animals who played an important historical part in out lives.
Leila the cat represents the only animal that adopted humans. Scientists from the University of California at Davis say that just as humans came from the rift zone in East Africa, cats originated in Egypt. Their ability to catch and eat mice made them valuable to us as we moved from being hunter-gatherers to raising grains for food.
I had a cat who liked to catch mice and bring them into my house and release them. She was proud of her skill in catching mice, but bringing them into the house live seemed a bit extreme to me, but not to her.",1369008000,,639,4.423728813559322
8285088,4,B001BXNB60,"The Case of the Grinning Cat by Chris Marker is shot in Paris on DV camera with narration in english and episodic french. It is a document of the presence of the image of a cat in Paris's inner-city social movement in 2004 from the presidential election through to the gulf war and the tragedy of a celebrity crime. The cat makes the case for a separation between the enforcement of criminal acts and the acts themselves, reported through politicians. At one time Marker suggests taking the opportunity to see the image of a cat over following the news of the war, as he wanders through egyptian statues of cats in the museums. But what if the cats are erased from sight? A message that has taken the place of the channels meant for transmitting the subjects of the state to war. We believe in the cat. If it is not there then we don't and tragedy takes the place of hope.

The 5 other short films of animals take over from the hidden complexes of human drama with a soundtrack to accompany, as pieces of home movie.

The horror of massacre of the whales takes the form of a picture book. A harpoon scene closes the story with the beauty of the whale shown as an extinct presence.

The last film is proof of the absurdity of epistomology. The sense of relief makes the price of this DVD worth it.",1365897600,,1296,4.369294605809128
8285089,5,B001BXNB60,"Chris Marker holds a unique place in cinema, with an approach to his subjects that is intensely personal, philosophical and poetic. This film is a fascinating study of social and political state of Paris and French politics following the events of September 11th and the ensuing war in Iraq. It is not unlike ""Le Joli Mai"" a 1962 documentary by Marker that focused on the state of mind of Parisians immediately following the end of the Algerian War. Both films, made 40 years apart, capture with humor the ironies of political activism, of political manipulations, and of hopes lost and regained.

The cat, an animal worshiped by Marker, is fiercely independent and ""never on the side of power."" He serves here as the backdrop for Marker's musings through the streets and the subway. The grinning cat appears over the rooftops of the city, in tunnels, on sidewalks, and finally in political protests. Real cats also punctuate the film, most notably ""Bolero,"" a cat who resides in the metro station of Strasbourg St Denis.

One of the final scenes (mentioned by another reviewer) is a reference to a murder that captivated the French media's attention for months: the brutal murder of actress Marie Trintignant by her boyfriend Bertrand Cantat, a French rock singer. Marker speaks of the ways in which tragedy quickly turns into a form of merchandizing, perhaps one of the most telling signs of our times.

This is a film essay with an English narration. The narration is well translated and captures the appropriate tone. Some of the graphics in French and the shots of advertisements and signs might get lost on the viewers not familiar with the language but the film will still be highly accessible regardless.",1266624000,7,1712,4.916955017301038
8285090,5,B001BXNB60,"I think this is a wonderful DVD. The main film is charming, clever, and has more to say than is obvious straight away. The shorts that are with it are worth the price of the DVD all by themseves. I particularly loved the short CAT LISTENING TO MUSIC. And there is a somewhat longer short doc (17 minutes) about whales which will break your heart. All together i think this is really one of Marker's best.",1231977600,6,404,4.328947368421052
8285091,2,B001BXNB60,"After seeing La Jetee, The Case of the Grinning Cat felt like a disappointment. The film is like a walk through Paris after 9/11, Marker follows protesters against Bush, Chirac, the Iraq war etc etc. Interspersed btwn the protests and related stuff are sightings of graffitti in the form of a grinning yellow cat (see the dvd cover). Marker finds this a mystery and tries to document the phenomenon. Here also follows some meditations on the cat as a symbol, and how it appears in stories like Alice in Wonderland etc.
The cat part is the interesting part of this film. It reminds of the Glaneuse-movie by Markers french new wave collegaue Agnes Varda (but Vardasfilm is much better). Anyway, the cat is intriguing and Markers quest to find out more about it begins well. But what is less interesting is the protest-part of the film. This feels so non original and flat. And why do I have to hear Markers smug remarks upon the validity of the protests, especially when they just reproduce the streamline leftist view? Boring. This is interesting only as a document of the times around 2001 in Paris with protests against government and Bush. And the problem is that Marker seems to become so fascinated by the protests that he forgets the cat (ok, he sees the cat on a sign in one of the marches against something, and this is obviously super interesting to Marker).
And can someone explain to me the last 10 minutes of the film? What has this story about an artist-turned-murderer got to do with anything? And what about the cat?
Bottom line: this film is worth watching, esp if you're into Marker and french film, but I can't really say that it is worth paying $25 for.",1221091200,9,1671,4.610738255033557
