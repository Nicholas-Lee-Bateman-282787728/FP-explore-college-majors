However, after reading how it didn't work on another customer's DVD players, I was a little hesitant.  Took a shot anyway and bought it.  Played it last night on my PS3 and it worked fine.  Not sure what happened to the other guy's copy, but just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.

Moviewise:  Funny movie, definitely geared toward slapstick with clever jokes.  The over-exaggerated design of a majority of the characters make it hilarious and good for a simple laugh with friends.",1393459200,,618,4.513513513513513
8520533,1,B007PM9D6S,"I have no idea how the movie is because contrary to the the listing this dvd is not ""All Region"". It is from Malaysia and will not play on any of my N American dvd players, (including a XBox 360 and PS3).

This is the second Takashi Miike dvd I have bought on Amazon that was advertised incorrectly. I bought ""The Great Yokai War""
