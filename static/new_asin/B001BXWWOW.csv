3499890,5,B001BXWWOW,"`Giorni e Nuvole' is a film that I had to witness twice in order to fully embrace.  I was initially struck by the films poignancy, especially in this world's economic state, but I must say that it wasn't until the beautiful ending that I was wholly moved to experience the film once more, under a different light.  As some have noted, the film seems to move rather slowly in parts, and that was my main concern initially.  I will say that the second time through it moved along far better for I had a different outlook.  It also allowed me to fully engage myself in this story and weed out moments and motives I wouldn't have noted the first time through.

Upon reflection it is easy to see that this film is about so much more that unemployment.

For me, this film deals with the stigma put on prominence and wealth.  The couple that is focused on here, Elsa and Michele, are a wealthy couple who enjoy the pleasures of life.  They like to travel, they own a boat, they engage in activities that suit their expensive palate.  Elsa herself is engaged in restoration activities that pay her nothing but give her a feeling of self worth and self appreciation.  They show an apparent loftiness of spirit, even if it is subtle, in their regard for their daughter Alice and her `low' standards with men and work.  Their world is tossed upside down when Michele loses his job and they have to limit themselves financially, risking losing everything.  Their relationship starts to fray, and while it is apparent that they have had issues in the past (Michele had an affair) it is the issue of money that has disbanded them completely.  Even Elsa makes a comment that she would have rather he been cheating again than have lost his job.  Money has defined their life and now they didn't have any.

The glimmer of hope that shines itself over the films ending (maybe they aren't as materialistic as they have appeared) was a major turning point for me, and one that I truly respect.  It layered on ray of light without beating us over with sentiment.  It allowed us to soak in all the horrible things they said and did as a result of their `predicament' but also allowed us to see that, while they are human and imperfect at that, they are not `bad' people.  They commit bad actions because of their emotional state, but those actions do not define them, and it isn't until that moment that we truly see them for who they are.

The acting here is phenomenal.  Margherita Buy and Antonio Albanese really understand the strain that their characters are under, and they approach each scene with a hesitant, almost distilled sense of humiliation.  They are ashamed and so they have to pretend not to be.

For me, this film really gets under the skin of a nation at the moment.  With the economy plummeting, the world is going to be a very different place for many people very soon, and this film helps illuminate an issue I don't think many people give much thought.  The situation that Elsa and Michele find themselves is not uncommon for many people today.  Unemployment and poverty is not a new or a rare thing.  What makes this case so significant and so detrimental is that it is happening to a couple who is far from used to having to be conservative.  It becomes so much harder and more devastating because they can't emotionally handle it.  When they handle stress by eating at a nice restaurant, how can they handle their newfound stress of NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD EATING OUT?  While one may look at their state and claim it a petty complaint, for there are people in far less desirable situations, one must understand the truth in the phrase `the bigger they are the harder they fall'.  This is also why the ending is so poignant for is shows the frivolousness in their self destructive actions but it also shows that all one needs in time of crisis is a proper set of priorities!",1275955200,11,3878,4.522238163558106

3499892,3,B001BXWWOW,This is a slice of very real life in current Italian society. Although the credit disaster isn't particularly mentioned the circumstances within the plot certainly bring that to mind.  Nothing high minded but a good slice of life.,1246665600,,230,5.052631578947368

3499894,3,B001BXWWOW,"Most of the days in this domestic drama are cloudy indeed. Elsa has just finished her art history degree as her mid-life project. Her husband Michele threw her a party, then afterwards broke the news that, in fact, he hadn't worked in two months because he was fired. All the feathers hit the fan. They must sell their house and boat, take jobs far beneath their station in life, battle emotions of fear and (for Michele) self-hatred, negotiate issues of friends and family, and decide whether to choose fight or flight. Days and Clouds won fifteen awards in the Italian equivalent of the Oscars, but I thought it dragged along rather predictably for too long (115 minutes) and then concluded rather blandly. Still, even though the story is cliched, it's certainly not a cliche for people who experience what they do, and in this sense the film delivers deep emotions. In Italian with English sub-titles.",1235433600,2,904,4.838709677419355
3499895,5,B001BXWWOW,"I love Italian movies and love Margarhita Buy as well.  This movie is both inspiring and scary too.  The realities of the world now are not those to be envied and admired.  There is insecurity all around us with our employment and overall financial situation.  I am fortunate to be currently employed, but this can change just as quickly as it did for Michele.  Being in my late 40's is a tough time to be out looking for a job where much of my competition is with those in their 20's and 30's.  I can totally understand the angst that Michele felt.  I too, can understand the helplessness and anger that Elsa felt too.  I can't imagine being told by a spouse that they have been out of work for 2 months and that everything in my world is now about to take a drastic move.

I highly recommend everyone see this wonderful movie !",1235088000,10,829,4.296774193548387
3499896,5,B001BXWWOW,"Times are tough right now, mirroring the era of The Great Depression.  Financial security is a ghost, friendships and relationships are tested by walking the razor edge of insolvency, and according to the 'popular movie' polls the escape for many is in the darkened movie houses with comic hero or animal animated mindless safety net entertainment.  Not so with the very brilliant film DAYS AND CLOUDS written (with Doriana Leondeff, Francesco Piccolo, and Federica Pontremoli) and directed with immaculate attention to detail by Silvio Soldini (BREAD AND TULIPS, etc).  Soldini recreates the global financial nightmare in the form of an examination of one family's fracture and consequences. It resonates despite the depressing story, offering a glimpse into the universal ties that bind us at this moment.

Elsa (Margherita Buy) is graduating from Art History and Restoration school and seems to be a woman on top of her league, complete with surprise gifts and a celebration staged by her husband Michele (Antonio Albanese). Waking up the morning after her congratulations party, Elsa is ill with a hangover, but even more shocked when Michele breaks the news to her that he has been out of work for two months, ashamed that he has lost his company and his job, hiding in the couple's boat during the day.  There is no money left and the couple must face losing their home and are forced to take on menial tasks to survive. Pride prevents the couple from sharing their financial downfall with friends and with their one child - Alice (Alba Rohrwacher) who has elected not to pursue education in favor of waiting tables in a restaurant she has invested in with friends.  The tension of keeping the secret to themselves causes mounting friction between the couple and events that would have never happened had they shared their misfortune with friends and family bring their relationship to a near fatal end. How they survive is touched, quietly and quickly and gently, at film's end.

Soldini spares no pain in the responses of his characters' misfortune, but at the same time he allows each character to emerge from ideal married tropes to completely human victims of financial ruin.  Buy and Albanese are triumphant in their performances as the married couple caught in the crumble of decline.  But there are fine performances by Rohrwacher and Fabio Troiano as her lover Riki, and Carla Signoris  as Elsa's closest friend Nadia, and actors playing two ex-employees of Michele  who provide a window of friendship in Michele's time of desperate need.

The cinematography by Ramiro Cirita and the musical score blending opera and folk music by  Giovanni Venosta enhance the motion of the film that though just under two hours in length, appears more succinct.  Silvio Soldini has taken a topic that affects us all and polished into a film that is bound to touch every viewer deeply.  Highly recommended movie from The Film Movement.

Anyone who feels secure and deserving in their comfortable middle class lifestyle is bound to come unhinged when watching this powerful film...What happens when you lose your prestigious position and privileges and suddenly find yourself working class ? How much do our jobs and homes define who we are?  If you lose that job, do you also lose your self-worth? Can you redefine yourself as working class, living where you never would have deigned to live before? Can you keep the same friends now that you can no longer afford to eat in the same restaurants?

Grazia and the young mother of Fernando's grandson both introduce themselves by name and profession.  A job defines in Italy.  What happens, however, is you lose your job and your place in society?  This is the question explored in Days and Clouds.  The husband is forced out of a company he helped found; he goes from being very affluent to having nothing at all. He tries various handy man activities to earn a little money, but hanging wallpaper by himself is too much.  Naturally, his marriage to a beautiful woman suffers.  Days and Clouds at times is difficult to watch, because you can't help remembering that in the US high unemployment can push people to suicide.

He knew he was unemployed and yet continued to spend like he had endless money trying to fool (or as he called 'protect') his wife.  Then when he skipped interviews, gave up on handyman jobs he started, and then had the nerve to fight with his wife about how she made him feel, was enough for me.  I had no respect, whatsoever, for this guy.  He chose to give up, he chose to live beyond his means and he chose to blame others for his misfortune.

Elsa finds the courage to tackle the difficulties, but Michele is closer to giving up. The economic decline is not just a term in this (and many other real-life) household - it leads to self-respect crisis, increasing social distance from the wealthier friends and puts on a surface the weaknesses of everyone involved.

When he did tell her, she discovered they could no longer afford their home or their boat.  The finances were almost depleted, and Michele, who was middle-aged, would have difficulty finding a good paying job.  He became temperamental and quarrelsome.  On several occasions, he insulted their adult daughter, Alice, who co-owned a restaurant with her boyfriend.

Elsa and Michele moved into a small apartment that desperately needed a facelift.  Elsa found an evening position as a temporary secretary.  Michele stopped looking for a job and did odds and ends for neighbors or tried to become a fledgling house-husband.

When Elsa had reached the end of her patience, and questioned him concerning employment, Michele became verbally abusive and shockingly insulting.  At that point, his slothful behavior and verbal abuse would have hurled a wrench in any marriage.

One thing in their favor, their marriage had lasted more than twenty years.  Elsa exuded kindness, patience and love toward Michele, whom I thought behaved immaturely during their setback.  He was lucky Elsa loved him unconditionally.
