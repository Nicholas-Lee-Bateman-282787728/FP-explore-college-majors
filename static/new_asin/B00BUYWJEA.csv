5676872,5,B00BUYWJEA,"This show is smartly written and incredibly funny. One of the best shows I've ever seen, I can't wait for the new season!",1377648000,,121,4.304347826086956
5676873,5,B00BUYWJEA,"Shameless by far is one of the best shows on television.  A brilliant blend of relatable comedy and drama with tour de force performances by the whole ensemble cast.  It also provides a different light to William H Macy that you'd swear that despite the fact it's a foreign character to his body of work, there's not an actor out there who could do it better.  Not a bad episode through its first 3 seasons.",1377475200,,407,4.4
5676874,5,B00BUYWJEA,"Honestly season 3 just may be my favorite season of Shameless so far! If you loved the first 2 seasons then you'll definitly love this one, and this is definitly a must buy when it gets released. I'm not gonna put any spoilers in my review, but Shameless continues to be a brilliantly written show and Shameless season 3 has plenty of drama, laughs, and top notch storylines. The acting from the whole cast is outstanding. There's not a bad actor in the bunch. You know how great William H Macy and Emmy Rossum are. It doesn't even need to be said at this point, but there are 2 other standouts this season imo. Jeremy Allen White as Lip and Noel Fisher as Mickey Milkovich. Noel Fisher finally becomes a regular this season and I couldn't be more happy. He completely transformers into Mickey Milkovich, and even if his content up to this point is less than most of the others he steals every scene he's in. For example, during the season finale he gets maybe 2 minutes of screentime overall, but those 2 minutes may be my favorite part of the whole finale.

Some people can talk about the show's ""Shameless"" content, but this show also has more heart and soul in one episode than most shows have in their whole run. It's truly a special show. So everyone buy this on release date or pre order it now! I can't wait for season 4.",1369785600,21,1329,4.402439024390244
5676875,5,B00BUYWJEA,This DVD set hasn't been released yet but I'm a big Shameless fan.  If you like shows with disfunctional families that make your family seem normal this is the show for you.  It has drama and lots of laughs.  I purchased the other two seasons from Amazon also. Each time I was able to purchase the blue ray version cheaper then getting it locally.,1369094400,5,347,4.390625
5676876,5,B00BUYWJEA,"NO SPOILERS:

The plot lines are more varied and complex with equal doses of laugh out loud comedy and heart break!

As in past seasons, Fionna (brillantly played by Emmy Rossum) is the proverbial glue that holds the Gallagher clan together.

This season is darker than seasons past and ends with cliffhanger.

Shameless makes no apologies for not being politically correct and doesn't care who is offended.",1368489600,2,407,5.029850746268656
5676877,5,B00BUYWJEA,"The last fifteen years or so have been referred to by many as the golden age of television, and I can't help but agree - what was once a (mostly) simplistic medium has finally has given us some great stuff to chew on. The Wire, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Breaking Bad, Deadwood and a handful of others have captured me the same way that great film or literature does - if not more so. I, like many others, become attached to these characters in a way that only long-form narratives can achieve.

As someone who constantly reads about, writes about and discusses these types of series on the internet, Shameless wasn't even on my radar. No one ever brings it up in ""greatest series"" discussions; and the critical reception, while mostly positive, isn't exactly overwhelming. I had seen the pilot episode around the time it premiered and wasn't impressed (and *still* not impressed with it, to be honest), so I avoided the show for years despite my girlfriend's glowing recommendations.

After seeing the first couple episodes of Season Three earlier this year, I immediately went out and bought the first two seasons on Blu-Ray. Wow. This is rich, hilarious stuff. It makes me laugh, cry, think, and even puts me on the edge of my seat from time to time. The characters, while often living up to the show's title, are downright loveable. Even ones I loathed at first, like deadbeat dad Frank (brilliantly portrayed by William H Macy), his wretched mother Grammy Gallagher, or ""dirtiest white-boy in America"" Mickey Milkovich, ended up gaining my sympathy. Every character is three-dimensional, and is brought to life by the best ensemble cast this side of Six Feet Under.

Sure, this show is ""outrageous"" - perhaps the most outrageous and over-the-top project in the medium's history in some respects - but never for the sake of outrageousness. These shocking moments end up going somewhere that's real, funny, or tragic. The writers will deliberately exaggerate certain life (usually poverty-driven) issues in order to make very real statements about them, without any false sentimentality or heavy-handed moralizing.

Season Three, while in my opinion not *quite* as great as the first two, is still wonderful, and doesn't feel even remotely contrived or tired. There are some big twists that bring the story into darker territory, and the stakes have never been higher.

I'm amazed that boring, paper-thin melodramas like Mad Men and Girls have received more acclaim and awards than this. I just hope that Shameless can someday get the recognition it deserves - and if not, oh well. It's a great series nonetheless, and in my opinion, the very best ""dramedy"" TV has to offer.",1367798400,75,2680,4.933481152993348
5676878,5,B00BUYWJEA,I have seen all three seasons of shameless and I must say this season is the best one yet. the stoylines were good/crazy sometimes but its shameless it kept you interested unlike the begining of season two but again I would keep watching because its shameless.overall I really enjoyed this season sad its over can't wait still 2014,1366675200,10,331,4.724137931034483

5676888,5,B00BUYWJEA,"This is an awesome show.  I heard about it and never thought I'd like it but then was bored one day and decided to try it out and I have been binge watching since.

Depending  on the episode I have favorite characters.  They all have a special place in my heart but what I love about the show most, is if you put aside the sex drugs drinking and law breaking, you have a family that loves each other and that is something special and makes the Gallaghers rich in ways that a lot of people will never know.

I know that just sounded clinched and lame but it's the truth.  I'm only on season 4 but I'm binging my way to the end.  The show isn't perfect.  There are things that I could do without.  Like I'm over Jody and his storyline, hopefully it's over.  V's mom is annoying. I wish Frank sometimes would have at least one redeeming quality.  Just because you are an alcoholic doesn't mean you are a horrible person.  Good people are alcoholics and so  are horrible people.  Frank's horrible drunk or sober.  I did have a touch of compassion as I saw the lengths he would go to to get alcohol in his system.  That was heartbreaking, even if it was Frank.

As I said I love the show and I think that underneath all the ""bad stuff"" is a story about family being most important.  Unfortunately, as advanced as I believe my 11 year old daughter is, there is no way I will ever watch this with her.  Not for tweens or young teens. Definitely for 17 and above. However I think I will save the one child birth scene if she ever  gets a serious boyfriend and needs a good scare. ",1490832000,,1572,4.190635451505017

5676906,5,B00BUYWJEA,"This is an incredible show of family dynamics gone array.  A young twenty year old to raise her 5 brother's and sisters, while their slosh father reeks havoc among the world.  William H. Macy is at his best! This show is enduring, it is not just a comedy but real life.  It oversteps boundaries but not so far that one would call this obscene.  The content is mature, and gives us insight into ways in which people live to literally survive from pay check to pay check.  It seems like none of the characters are able to have a lasting romantic relationship(besides the neighbors) but in the family romantically each are doomed.  Personally I appreciate this, knowing a long stream of bad romances.  Yet, there is always the hope of love, but more importantly how vital family is to and for one another,  The family is one anther's life essence and to be greatly respected.  Comedic, provocative, heart-wrenching, vial; this television series has it all.  I hope it continues on and thrives!",1485475200,,990,4.703488372093023

5677032,5,B00BUYWJEA,"Emmy Rossum commands Showtime's Shameless. Every episode is like riding a roller coaster while blindfolded- will you go up a huge hill, plummet straight down, or be surprised by a full stop? For people who think their own family is a big cluster that can't get any worse, just one episode of Shameless is more than enough to change your thinking.

The entire cast, from lead roles to recurring characters, minor parts to special guest stars, has to be one of the most talented and close-knit ensembles put together in a long time. Bravo to the casting department; job very well done.

Another ardent bravo goes to the show's producers, directors, writers, cinematographers, and EVERY person working on the show behind the scenes. It takes a small city to put together just one episode of Shameless- and these people are the best in the business.

Shameless is one of those shows you can watch from the very beginning and end up in the middle of season three before you're even aware.

I can't wait to see what Shameless has in store for future episodes. Just when you think everything that can happen already has, the writers and producers have you blindfolded and strapped in to another roller coaster they call Shameless.",1463875200,,1223,4.781990521327014

5677237,5,B00BUYWJEA,Shameless is one of those serial type episodes that you can't wait till the next one comes on,1423008000,,93,4.222222222222222
5677238,3,B00BUYWJEA,"Either I've finally od'd on ""Shameless"" (after marathon watching seasons 4,1 and 2) or else this season is just not up to par. I'm also getting way too attached to the Gallager family and friends because I'm taking it all too personally. As I said in my review of season 4, I watched that one first because it was the only one available on my On Demand, then I watched the first and second seasons- all of which I enjoyed and found incredibly funny- so now I'm enduring the third season. It could be that watching them out of order is affecting my opinion of the show, but the third season is just not as enjoyable as the other seasons. I even started watching season five and have loved all the episodes so maybe it just hit a lull. I am noticing that there is way more graphic sex than necessary which I find irritating. (If I wanted to watch a porn flick then I would watch that instead!) I think the writers or producers resort to using sex scenes as ""filler"" to keep us preoccupied so we don't notice the lack of good material. It's almost like ordering crab cakes at a nice restaurant and finding the chef put in very little crab meat and an excess of bread crumbs as filler. It is disappointing as a loyal viewer and fan of the series to be denied the essential ""meat"" of this great show. I rely on the funny situations and sharp writing that originally made this show so humorous and appealing. I feel cheated and now I'm not getting the right amount of bang for my buck. (Actually I'm getting too much banging.) I mean Fiona and Lip are the biggest whores I've seen since Samantha on ""Sex and The City."" I've never seen so much humping and I used to watch ""Hung!"" And Ian is nothing more than a man-gina, who, by the way, is so heartless and cruel to his lovers that I find myself rooting against him. Plus his boyfriend, Mickey is so obnoxious that I almost want to mute his dialogue. Every other syllable out of his mouth is the f word. And by the way, whose idea was it to name these characters? It gets confusing to have Ian and Liam plus Mandy and Amanda (who actually doesn't come in til the next season so I'm getting ahead of myself here.) Frank is still behaving (or misbehaving) in his usual manner. The barmaid who comments that he has sunk to a new low by calling child services on his own kids obviously wasn't aware of the fact that he also denied a woman the heart transplant she desperately needed to save her life. Karma is gonna crush Frank way before alcoholism gets him. Carl and Debbie can still be counted on for entertainment. Both characters bring so much to the show and it's nice to have someone to root for. As for Fiona and Jimmy/Steve...were they watching too much ""Dawson's Creek"" growing up? I joked earlier that this show reminded me of ""Party Of Five"" but now it really feels like I'm watching that show brought back to life. The long pensive glances of love that they keep giving each other is a bit nauseating. I find their love story dull and annoying. Fiona, or Liesl von Trapp, is nothing more than a neurotic doormat. She definitely needs to get a life and stop being just a whiny den mother. Lip also needs to step off- the ""Good Will Hunting"" thing is played. Another future karma victim. V and Kevin are still among the best parts of the show. I love those two. The guest stars are worth mentioning- Joan Cusack is always good and I've enjoyed seeing Harry Hamlin still looking good since his days on ""L.A. Law."" All in all this show still has some great characters, great story lines and great writing. I just find that there's too much of what I don't want to see and not enough of what I do. Less sex, profanity and whining and more laughs please.",1422921600,2,3701,4.3497109826589595

5677251,5,B00BUYWJEA,"Viewing this series is like watching a train wreck. Yes, it exploits the suffering of the underclass, but the politics are not all bad. William Macy plays a ""narcissistic alcoholic"" that will go down in the video annals as one of the most despicable characters since Al Pacino played Roy Cohn. The ensemble cast construct characters that evolve in fascinating ways. They have a keen understanding of how the economy is rigged to benefit the few at the cost of the many.

Fiona continues to work hard, but takes time to enjoy life. The season has a few humorous surprises and messed up situations, but the show sticks to the formula that makes it hilarious.

However, in this season we finally see Frank show a little maturity as he takes the rap for Carl. Which leads to probably my favorite scene in season 3 when Frank's in jail.

Macy, although he is also fine. Also particularly good is Jeremy Allen White as Lip, the high school genius who can't quite commit to his education and often dabbles on the wrong side of the law. Also young Ethan Cutcosky just keeps getting better and better as Carl, a thorough delinquent who continues to love his dad after the rest of the family has ceased to care about him.

Worth buying the entire series and having a Shameless marathon.

Side Note: I do find it amazing that almost every actor in this series has appeared nude, and in a sex scene, and it does not appear to be gratuitous.  Well, with the exception of Emmy Rossum, it doesn't appear to be gratuitous.  (This is not a complaint.)",1406505600,,568,4.519607843137255

You get so addicted and attached to the Gallagher family that they start to feel like people you know.  I start having anxiety when one of them is away from each other too long... It's crazy!  The topics that are covered on this show (alcoholism/bipolar disease/family issues, etc...) are so real it hurts.  There's not someone on this show that you don't identify with and/or root for.  The cast is amazing and have grown so much with their characters that I sometimes forget that they aren't 'Lip' or 'Ian' or 'Mickey'

The last we see him, in Episode 11, he is walking ""like a man""onto his drug lord father-in-law's yacht. Remember what happened to Esty's boyfriend? We know that is in store for Steve. But why? One hopes that the guilty are punished--for example, much as we liked him, Walter White died in the last episode of ""Breaking Bad."" He had killed people and continued to sell meth, even though his original motivation had been to support his family after he was dead.
  In ""Shameles, we are told that Esty's boyfriend hit her, so we  don't feel quite so bad about his fate. But Jimmy/Steve? His one major screwup was failing to pick up Esty's phone calls after she had called him about her broken heel. Aside from that, he had just been readmitted to Michigan for med school and he only had a year to go. So what if he gets a studio apartment? Michigan is a tough school, and its medical program is one of the best in the nation. Why shouldn''t he move away for year and come home on weekends to Chicago? That sounds reasonable rather than traitorous. So he lied to Fiona then and when he was stealing cars--he had his reasons, and it seemed throughout that he was committed to Fiona. She is one who refused to go with him to Costa Rica, after all. She didn't even call him to explain. Yet the logical underlying reason that Jimmy/Steve isn't trustworthy is becasue he  lied to  Fiona a few times., sometimes for her own good. .
  In Season 3, Steve's parents are getting divorced and his father tells him the family legacy has dissipated. So Steve is like Fiona--living by his wiits without a golden parachute..But that is barely emphasized.  Fiona tries to get  him on his phone repeatedly over a number of days, but she never suwspects foul play--even though she knows he is married to the daughter of a drug lord.  Fiona obviously is not as smart as we thought.
  Steve/Jiommy resists getting out of the Escalade becasue he knows what awaits him. But his chauffeaur and babysitter tells him to ""act like a man for once."" and walk onto the boat. I kept waiting for Jimmy/Steve to jump into the water and swim away. but he never did that. He went--like a martyr--to his fate. Is that how men act?  We know Daddy Drug Lord really didn't care about his daughter's wishes--witness his cruel shooting of her boyfriend. So her protests are unlikely to move her stone-cold father. The implications of the fact that Fiona's calls have gone unanswered for a week or so is chilling.
  Why, why, why? did the writers decide to off Jimmy/Steve, of all the characters? Surely Mandy was more culpable, but she walked away from destroying Karen's life wiith a scolding from Liip. Daddy Gallagher was horrrible throughout, screwing his children whenever he had an avenue for making money, except for the sdene iin this episide where he tells the police it was his fault..
  Fiona, of course, was better than good, but not quite perfect. She slept with her boss before she knew Jimmy/Steve's fate, and even after a week, she didn't think Jimmy/Steve might be in dire trouble. Previously,  Jimmy/Steve';s devottion to Steve rwas  quite obvious -- he took care of the kids,. cleaning up affer them, buying and cooking the food for them..Why would she think he would just walk out on her without a backward glance? He never did anything like that before.
  There were so many characters who lied, cheated and even killed without punishment that is just sounds a wrong note for Jimmy/Steve to be killed. Let's hope his father-in-law confiscated Jimmy/Steve's phone and reunited him with his daughter on board., confiscating his phones and with several babysitters watching over him.  Let's hope Daddy Drug Lord recognizes the prestige of having a son-in-law who graduated from University of Michigan's medical school, and let's Jimmy/Steve finish school, as long as he makes Esty pregnant and never contacts Fiona again. Then Steve's punishment is being married to a ditz with a murderous father-in-law. At least he is still alive.

5677355,1,B00BUYWJEA,"The way this show consistently depicts violence, drug use, prostitution, pre-adolescent sexuality, sodomy and the sodomite as normal and routine, even banal, elements in the tapestry of ""enlightened"" modern urban life is appalling and repulsive. As a kind of dystopic ethnography, however, Shameless remains instructive, managing the seemingly impossible feat of squeezing into each episode, if only in the smallest measure, every form of human degeneracy and vice imaginable; offering the viewer a very vivid cross-sectional glance of a sick, depraved culture--not too distant from our own today--that is the inevitable result of the subversion of traditional social norms by the the basest human instincts, and where the untrammeled forces of greed, lust, fornication, and violence are given free rein. The writers of Shameless, in seeking to titillate and shock a morally jaded audience (comprised predominantly of corrupt teens and thirty something Gen X-ers) through a calculated (and tritely predictable) recurrence to gratuitous displays of amoral sexuality and violence, demonstrate not only a crass cynicism and intense contempt for the sensibilities of their viewers, but in some measure also set in sharp relief the misery and absurdity that is the inevitable issue of a philosophy of life which has adopted as its guiding ethic the nihilistic imperative to ""do what one pleases when one pleases"", a stark hallmark of every exhausted, decaying culture, from Roman times up to our own.

Moreover, in contrast to the ethnic and racial pluralism conspicuously on display in every layer of the show's heterogeneous, episodic structure, it is interesting to note that no less than THREE OUT OF SEVEN of the writers of Shameless are ethnically Jewish. Should this surprise us? that the ethnic group most active in the production and dissemination of hard core porn in America and abroad, should figure disproportionately in the writing of what is arguably the raunchiest, most unabashedly pornographic mainstream serially produced show in the history of television entertainment? That the long procession of anti-white tropes neatly woven into every story line, in which whites are cartoonishly portrayed as either ridiculous patronizing bigots or cynical guttersnipes more than willing to cash in on ""white privilege"" should the need arise; in which young white women are shiftless criminal offenders and non-whites their innocent victims; in which snow white Christian Bibles are set ablaze and ethnic Russians, historically the great hobgoblins of the largely Eastern European Jewish diaspora, are all corrupt racketeers and prostitutes, a slander that would no doubt elicit howls of protest from organized Jewry were it directed by a white gentile majority at any other group, should issue from an ethnic quarter notorious for its crass chauvinism and racial double standards?

Has anyone else bothered to inquire as to how or why a people whose presence in this country consists of little more than an miniscule two percent of the total population should somehow come to make up forty percent of the writers of a vulgar farce like Shameless, not to speak of the similarly conspicuous Jewish ethnic influence exerted on other decadent shows like Mad Men, House of Lies, Masters of Sex, Sex and the City, etc.? Why are so many people of Jewish descent so keen on exhibiting for public consumption a crude, dispiriting, dehumanizing portrait of American life, awash in rootlessness and the depravity of moral relativism, while through the mainstream Jewish organizations speaking nearly in unison out of the opposite sides of their mouths in addressing Jewish causes generally, and Zionism and the Arab-Israeli conflict in particular, with regard to which we are condescendingly instructed to uphold by these same influential representatives of God's chosen, the fairy tale of the morally superior Jewish state engaged in a heroic campaign against evil Arabs to retain its sacred ethno-cultural core, one, it is hypocritically insisted, that deserves to be upheld by force of the unstinting flow of American money, arms, and diplomatic cover, despite the overwhelming evidence that such a policy runs counter to genuine U.S. national interests, fomenting regional instability by locking the U.S. in a costly civilizational war with the Muslim world?

These are, after all, the same organized Jewish groups that comprise the vanguard of those who aggressively promote multiculturalism and open immigration in the United States and Europe. Could the gross hypocrisy at play in this juxtaposition therefore be any more palpable? or any more deplorable? Is there even anyone left with the courage necessary to broach such dangerous questions, in these shameless and disheartening days of low thought, and even lower living?",1395100800,4,4826,5.423435419440746

5677435,5,B00BUYWJEA,"This show makes me cringe because some of the characters are so despicable, but I keep watching because the show is fascinating, hilarious, and tremendously well-acted. The Galllaghers  lead a life that is completely different than anything I've ever known, and the means they use to get by are, shall we say, unconventional. But the characters have enormous depth. Some are rotten through and through, but with many of them, their good hearts shine through even while they're breaking the law. Above all, they love and care for each other. The writing is top notch and the stories, endlessly compelling.i just love this show, even when I have to force myself not to turn away.",1378512000,11,677,4.886956521739131
