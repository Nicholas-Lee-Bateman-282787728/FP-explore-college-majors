8200728,3,B000RHMQLC,"Don't let the picture or another review fool you, It is only big enough to hold the 3 dvds in the series, and maybe some foam to keep it from bouncing around. I was hoping for a big briefcase but it really isn't any different from the regular collectible tins. I'd say it's about half the size of a regular lunchbox. Also it's aluminum(aluminium for Europeans) instead of plastic, which at first seems nice, but remember that it can rust, scratch, and dent easily. The latches seems sturdy but the handle is pure plastic, not cheap but also not that great. The picture is really misleading. I got it cheap enough so no complaints. It's nothing special or worth bragging about.",1378684800,,676,4.595041322314049
8200729,1,B000RHMQLC,"I think I'll mention its good points first. The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it. There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all. Out of the many anime series I own, this is the worst. I agree with the review that said, ""at least it was cheap"". If you pay money for this you will probably be very annoyed.",1353196800,,812,4.313725490196078
8200730,4,B000RHMQLC,"The manufacturer when to a lot of trouble and expense to package this particular DVD.  The case is NOT made of cardboard, so is really surprisingly useful for many things -- the least of which is holding a DVD.  The handle folds down for compactness (is that a word?), and the hinged lid is held in place with two flip latches.

As for the Anime, it's fairly entertaining and rated for mature audiences.  So, I find it odd that a DVD that is rated for 17 and above comes enclosed in a case that seems obviously geared to the young.  Oh well, they got ME to buy it, and I haven't been 17 for many light years.  Also, I'm someone who isn't into anime.  I just bought the DVD for the case!  I was very curious as to its manufacture, and the price was right.",1289088000,2,754,4.151724137931034
8200731,5,B000RHMQLC,"This is great, very interesting anime series. all I can say not for the younger kids for example the main character has two secret weapons and she knows how to use them.",1255824000,2,169,4.3125
8200732,3,B000RHMQLC,"In the world of 009-1, the Cold War between the Western and Eastern Blocs has gone on for 140 years.  This is not a war fought between great armies on desolate nuclear battlefields. This is a war fought by covert agents on both sides in a cat and mouse contest for technological advantage. Mylene Hoffman, cyborg agent 009-1, is the best spy the Western Bloc has, but she has one distinct weakness. She still has a heart. Time and again, she has faced situations on her missions where her compassion has compromised her original orders. Her superiors are even beginning to wonder whether it's worth the risk to keep her in the field. Her old mentor, ironically named Ironheart, told her a long time ago that the worse thing an agent could do was to let their emotions get the better of them. Wouldn't you know that Mylene would be seen to talk her one-time mentor into rejoining the Zero Zero Organization or face execution.  She also opens  a heap of worms when pity gets the better of her when she helps a stranded motorist outside Rome who is being chased by gunmen. Mylene  also uses a kid to get closer to a suspected enemy agent and faces another moral quandary. In the last episode we get a flashback to Mylene's past and how she came to become a 00 agent, which is unusual because in most series of this type, the lead character's past is left a mysterious blank with nary a hint of how they developed.

This second volume of 009-1 suffered from a sophomore slump after an intriguing but sometimes flawed first volume. While I respect the complex emotions the writing was going for, the episodes were a bit too predictable. They seemed nothing more than a series of moral debates in search of a storyline, or a sequence of yes or no questions. Will she shoot her old mentor? Will she lie to the young boy? Will she help the stranded motorist?  With questions like this, you have a 50% chance of guessing the outcome of each episode. The animation quality was very high and the 1960's wardrobe and car designs were definitely cool in a chic retro sorta way. But the writing didn't aspire high enough for a series with such a beautiful look.",1188259200,5,2147,4.506426735218509
