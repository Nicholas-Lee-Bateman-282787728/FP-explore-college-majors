8061683,1,B0009IWFWO,"My mom purchased this dvd at Gettysburg when we were there last week. For the price she paid for it, it was NOT worth it. With all of the photos I took, I could do a far better job of narrating a DVD with key facts and locations. For such an important and pivotal point in the war, the makers of this video should have done far more and far better than what they did. The extras are equally as bad, if not worse.",1405728000,,412,3.9166666666666665
8061684,4,B0009IWFWO,What content provided is very acceptable.  However was disappointed in length of program.  Has a few extras but not happy with the price for only 55 minutes of actual tour.  Still recommend for a true Civil War enthusiast.,1355529600,,222,4.7894736842105265
8061685,1,B0009IWFWO,"If you know anything about the civil war you know that the battle of Gettysburg was not only a pivotal battle of the civil war but that it was also the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere and considered to be among the most decisive battles in history. With that in mind, I would expect that any tour of the battlefield would be approached with respect and reverence. But you find nothing of the sort in this DVD. This DVD treats the battlefield tour like a tour of a cracker factory. It is a silly, irreverent treatment of hallowed ground. Not recommended for anyone remotely interested in Civil War History.",1162166400,8,626,4.598214285714286
