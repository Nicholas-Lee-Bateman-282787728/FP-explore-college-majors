2860976,5,B000R7I3X2,"Two of Mark's best movies, in my opinion, from an action-comedy-drama Four Brothers to an action-thriller Shooter, both with great elements of each genre.

Shooter is more about revenge from one character, and a greater plot on a national scale.

For this price in one Blu-Ray package, it's ideal to have.",1387843200,3,451,5.263888888888889
