8038979,3,B00065GHFQ,Good production quality and not a bad instructional video but I would recommend a different bass player/video for learning slap basics.,1516233600,,135,5.476190476190476
8038980,3,B00065GHFQ,"I am not a musician, but I know someone with the same name... bought this product as a gag.  He is a musician, and a bass player.  He was not very impressed with the DVD, but thought it was very ironic that his name and same instrument that he plays was on a DVD label... :-)  Do not take my review as an endosement or criticism of this DVD.  I do not have a musical background to judge this product.",1227398400,,400,3.9625
8038981,5,B00065GHFQ,"First I am not a bass player/never was!!!  I had a 4 string fender
in 83 and belong to a group called CRYSTAL FLAME headed by my bro
NO LONGER DEVIL here on AMAZON... I was in his band for oh say 4 weeks
and still never learned how to play.  I was always short on patience
and if something did not come easy to me right off the bat I GAVE UP!
Well I'm proud to say my Bro N.L.D. never did and is a VERY good guitar
player now...I know nothing of music except for what I hear and I
believe this DVD is good for not only beginners but those who have
played a short while.  If your new to the bass and would like to start
here is a good DVD it not only shows you the basics but pick playing
slap playing and my personal favorite finger playing it is a instrument
I feel gets the run down from peoples fav. Like guitar/drums and piano
I also would like to give my personal top 10 best players that I have seen....

10. RUDY SARZO He is not one of the best by any means and I can see
my Bro N.L.D. saying WHAT!?!  But hell I like him and really dig
his bass playing on TRIBUTE and SPEAK OF THE DEVIL he is to me
the best bass player Ozzy has worked with since Geezer Butler
stand out tunes from him...LITTLE DOLLS and live NEVER SAY DIE
which dare I say(DARE CLINT DARE)plays it to a tee!!!

9. CLIFF BURTON  The short lived bass player was the back bone of
the group METALLICA and is sorely miss he had a great style and have
heard him called from some as the Angus Young of bass(think that is
more to his movement than playing)anyway he WAS a great bass player
and still feel the albums he was on was the bands best..Recommend
MASTER OF PUPPETS and KILL THEM ALL

8. FLEA  Is a fantastic bass player for the red hot RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
his idols are some names I don't know (well one but I will get to him)
that are from motown and his playing shows it. He really loves the bass
and gives his all at every performance Recommend MOTHERS MILK

7. GEDDY LEE  I love old RUSH AND Geddy is great but I find myself
reading other great bass players who mention him for inspiration
I feel his bass playing on the albums FLY BY NIGHT & 2112 really show
he is not just another bass player

7* GEEZER BUTLER  Personally my favorite bass player I love my Terry
and he is VERY,Very,very,.... good his best bass playing never gets
heard in my opinion for his stuff like IRON MAN-SWEET LEAF and PARANOID
are always played...I SAY BOLLOKS to that and listen to NEVER SAY DIE
SABOTAGE and MOB RULES for the best of Butler: MY GEEZ WILL PLEASE

6. BILLY SHEEHAN  He is very fast I give him that!  He was in the bands
DAVID LEE ROTH and MR.BIG and must say he does play the bass like
EDDIE VAN HALEN plays his guitar with finger tapping and teeth picking
he does put on a show...RECOMMEND the album MR.BIG

6*CHRIS SQUIRE  He is from the band YES and is indeed a phenomenal
bass player PHENOMENAL...Too bad he knows it.  Still no bass playing
list is complete without him just listen to the song ROUNDABOUT!!!
recommend YES FRAGILE

5. STEVE HARRIS  Again no and I mean NO!  Bass list is complete without
this man.  A gifted bass player who plays till his fingers bleed!!!
Steve has written some great bass riffs that will live on forever!
Please if you do not know of him look him up...He is brilliant!!!
Recommend KILLERS & NUMBER OF THE BEAST from his band IRON MAIDEN

4. STU HAMM  A fantastic bass player who can come on stage with just
about anyone. I have just started to see his playing and WOW!!!!
Recommend Joe Satriani Live and Beyond and Stevie Ray Vaughn's Live
in Texas

3. JOHN ENTWISTLE  The mighty bass player of THE WHO probably has more
followers to bass playing than any other and for good reason!!!
He is a true genius of the bass and when THE WHO started out made Keith
Moon nervous for his playing was so great(and we all know how Keith
was on the drums) If you were to tell me he should be at number 1
on my list you are probably right.  He is one of a kind....
Recommend WHO'S NEXT and QUADROPHNIA

2. LES CLAYPOOL  My man Les!!!  When I saw him play with The Steve Morse
band in 95 I felt I had just seen the all knowing all seeing of the 4
string(did not help that Morse was in awe either) He is a MASTER of
the 4 string and has played with such talents as BUCKETHEAD-ROY CLARK
B.B.KING-JOE SATRIANI and JEFF BECK...Just to name a few!?!
Recommend anything from PRIMUS

1. JACO POSTORIOUS  He is Les Claypool's idol and many others
I really do not know of the man...:(  But if good enough for Les
good enough for me.  My AMAZON bro MR.KNOW IT ALL seems to think
highly  of him and he is a Bass player so I put him first for so
many bass players bring his name up

Well thats my list if you are looking at it and saying..MAN! I CAN'T BELIEVE HE LEFT OUT HIM...Well let me know chances are I don't know
him?  See ya everybody play music  Thanks to N.L.D.-MR.K.I.A and
I have another AMAZON bro who plays bass???Is it you J?
I forgot?  Just wanted to say thanks :)",1207872000,2,4968,4.118380062305296
8038982,5,B00065GHFQ,"Terrific exercises, with examples played by Prof. Vitti, plus split screen films of his top playing.  If you are disciplined and willing to stick with the lessons sequentially, this is one of the best I've seen.  Its only flaw is the very tiny booklet of the music and exercises.  You need a magnifier to follow the notes or tabs.",1201651200,2,330,4.559322033898305
8038983,4,B00065GHFQ,"This DVD will help you develop groove and technique.  Contains a number of exercises, interval and ear training as well as stylistic approaches on Bass.",1141084800,2,152,5.08
