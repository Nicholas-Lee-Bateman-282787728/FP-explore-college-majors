1944829,5,B0000TPADS,"I have been a Brel Fan for many years. This film gives one the meaning of what all our dreams are about in his songs. I have always been a fan of the great Elly Stone. As a Singer myself, I worked with Elly Stone in New York at Carnegie Hall where I sang backup for her and studied with her also. She has such passion in her music. Brel is Passion. The late Joe Masiell has a great screen presence and his rendition of ""Next"" will always be remembered as the most moving song ever put on film. The late Mort Shuman is perfectly suited for this film as his comic flair shines in his singing. I recommend this Film for any Singer or Acting Student because you can feel the passion of the songs from the singer/actors. Jacques Brel will live on forever.",1155340800,10,750,4.179310344827586
1944830,5,B0000TPADS,"as a huge jacques brel fan, owning all the dvd footage of him, and being an american who cannot understand french, i love this film!!!  the translations are beautiful and being a musical fan, the voices and the shooting is great.  i see that a lot of people gave a lot of bad reviews, well being a writer and a muscian i LOVE IT!!!",1154995200,17,331,4.15625
1944831,2,B0000TPADS,"I had heard some of Jacques Brel's music before. I worked on stage production of this in Southern Oregon a number of years ago and I had also heard Judy Collins sing a couple of his songs.

Not knowing french, I can't say much about the translations. But what they showed along with the songs was at times strange if not down right disturbing. The visuals presented in ""Sons Of"" were not at all what I would have expected. When I had heard Judy Collins sing this with her warmth and sincerity I had pictured something entirely different. I was actually quite glad that the visuals accompanying ""If We Only Have Love"" were relatively simple. That's a song I have always liked and I was delighted not to see it visually interpreted in some bizarre fashion as were some of the other songs.

I think had they just shot this as a stage production or as an ""in concert"" format it would have been better.",1154649600,5,897,4.430303030303031
1944832,1,B0000TPADS,"The play was a marvel.  The soul and essence of Jacques Brel's extraordinary songs transposed into English for American sensibilities presented as a kind of cabaret revue.

It would have been better for all concerned if they had just filmed the show that ran for four years in New York.

Instead, the same team that had forged that magical show into a coherent whole, retreated into a mish-mash of absurdist vignettes abounding in the worst excesses of art-house, pseudo-psycho-pop schlock.  It is literally painful to sit through.  Then, to add insult to injury, the singing is sub-standard as well.  They should have just lip-synched to the broadway cast album, but, no - it's almost as if they were out to prove that they couldn't do anything right with this show.  Like they needed to prove that you can't go home again - you can't repeat greatness.

So they turned a piece of magic into something tragic.

You may not believe this film is as bad as I say.  Trust me, it is.

The only reason it gets one star is because of a 5-minute segment wherein Jacques Brel himself sings ""Ne Me Quitte Pas.""  They couldn't wreck that moment, even though I'm sure they must have tried.",1140048000,19,1177,4.632850241545894
1944833,1,B0000TPADS,"In 1967 Brel stopped doing concert tours, giving rise to the title of this off-broadway revue based on his songs, which opened Jan. 22, 1968 at the Village Gate in Greenwich Village.

Unfortunately many of these songs translated just a phrase or two from the original Brel song and then went on to write entirely new lyrics that went far afield of Brel's original songs and lacked the stunning poetic beauty and raw emotional power of the original songs.

I believe glowing references to Mort Shuman and Eric Blau's translations were written by people who don't know much French and were not very familiar with the original songs. What this revue amounts to is a set of American songs that may have been inspired by Brel but bear little relation to the powerful poetic songs Brel wrote.

That the production was very successful in its own right (2000 performances!) is perhaps a testament to the wit and abilities of the Shuman/Blau team. However, these performances leave the knowledgeable Brel fan hugely disappointed, and it leaves American audiences with a very distorted view of what Brel's lyrics and music were really like.

Much better English translations of 40 Brel songs were published in 2004 with the release of a new 2-disc compilation ""Infiniment"", but be careful because only the 2004 release on DRG records contains the translation, not the 2003 release on Universal. Wonderful, but abridged, translations as well as a mini-bio of Brel in the liner notes were created by the superb Amazon.com reviewer Thelma F. Blitz.

What's even more fabulous than this DVD, however, is the 3 volume DVD set released in 2003: Jacques Brel: Comme quand on etait beau. (ASIN: B0000AQJPR). Also of great interest: the VHS video ""Jacques Brel"" (ASIN: B0001P1XG4), a video biography on the life and music of Jacques Brel.

My advice: skip this DVD (Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris) but buy some of his French CDs and the 3 DVD set of Brel singing his own songs in French, if you're a huge fan of Jacques Brel like me.",1130716800,6,2034,4.797142857142857
1944834,1,B0000TPADS,"As a big Brel fan, I saw this today and was intrigued and so bought it. It may have been the show that claims to have introduced non-French speaking audiences to his music but it is the most painfully awful thing that I have every seen and heard. It is so dated and clichd 70's awful acting. The ""performers"" none of them appear to be able to sing in the slightest - they just seem to screech through the awful ""translations"" of his songs. I cringed watching is - it is just so awful. It not only is a travesty of Brel's music, it is also so badly acted and sung. The translations and ""interpretations"" of his songs are just so bad. Brel himself makes cameo appearances in this production but for the life of me I cannot fathom why he did and allowed them to murder his music like this. This really is the worst of American 70's theatre productions. I sincerely wish I'd saved my money and spend it on another original Brel recording - or almost on anything else than this. I cannot emphasise enough to people not to waste their money on this. Even as a piece of Brel memorabilia it is the kind of thing that I'd want to hide behind some books and it own up to processing. The original French of his songs are deeply poetic and touch the deepest of emotions - all this production does is make you cringe and think ""it can not possibly get any worse"" - and unfortunately it does go on and prove you wrong - it does just get worse and worse. Save your money and stick to the original songs sung by him in French and not put yourself and Brel's music through this torture! All I can hope to recover from this is that I am able to dissuade anyone else from making the same mistake as me and buying it!!!!",1124064000,12,1700,4.201834862385321
1944835,5,B0000TPADS,"I would think this would be PG in France or for an audience of drunks in a nightclub.  This DVD contains smoking and drinking, a few boobs, plenty of theatrical stunts, some outdoor scenery, and enough music to be considered a musical.  The film was made in 1974, when the title, ""Jacques Brel is alive and well and living in Paris"" was being overly euphemistic about his health.  Brel (1929-1978) was born in Belgium, which was occupied by Nazis for four or five years when he was growing up.  The saddest song on this DVD, ""Marieke"" retains a bit of Flemish and shows a cemetery while Elly Stone sings of someone buried in Flanders.  Brel was popular as a singer-songwriter until he was diagnosed with cancer and began to cut back his public appearances in 1967, and this film was made the year he stopped performing, though he is shown in some scenes.  If you need to know what he looks like, see him smoking in the Theatrical Trailer on the DVD, which also identifies the film stars Elly Stone, Mort Shuman, and Joe Masiell.

For people who have seen the film, Mort Shuman (1937-1991) might be remembered as the singer of ""The Taxi Cab Driver"" which is selection 8 on the DVD.  Mort Shuman and Eric Blau (whose wife is singer Elly Stone) were co-producers of the theatre cabaret version of ""Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris"" which opened on January 22, 1968 at the Village Gate on Bleeker Street in Greenwich Village, where it ran for over 1800 performances.  The attempt to reach the enormous audiences on Broadway only had 51 performances, but the English adaptations of Brel songs by Mort Shuman and Eric Blau have become better known than some of the originals.  People who remember all of the music from 1968 ought to remember an album called ""Wildflowers"" on which Judy Collins sang ""La Chanson des vieux amants"" with the original words by Jacques Brel, music and words by Jacques Brel and Gerard Jouannest.  The ""Song of the Old Lovers"" is selection 23 on this DVD and allows fans to hear the words in English.  Brel worked with a number of composers for the music to his songs, and this DVD provides a variety of musical styles.

Harry Chapin had a song about driving a taxi cab, too, but the tone of the ""I drive the Taxi Cab"" song on this DVD is a bit closer to the feelings of the strange hero of the movie ""Taxi Driver"" in which an ex-Marine is up all night anyway and sees what is going on at all hours, most of which he would like to flush down the toilet.  Selection 22, ""The Middle Class"" has a chorus based on the idea:  the middle class are pigs.  Already in selection 2, ""Marathon"" the force of history is emphasized with videos of a string of events that has an impact like Billy Joel singing ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" to a younger generation of MTV viewers.  For Americans who missed the plethora of anti-war feelings generated by the active involvement of millions in some stupid history lesson, the fate of Europe as complained about by ""The Statue"" in selection 4 captures the bitterness of being dead at the end of the years 1880-1918 as hatred of childhood innocence, but whoever wanted a statue in the damn park anyway?

The song ""Carousel"" near the end has flashback clips from the other songs, with everything spinning around like a top as the main theme, which makes the last song a relief.  ""If We Only Have Love.""  Total time 97 minutes, and if you haven't figured out what it was about by then, you can watch the Theatrical Trailer a few times to see whose success and fame this film was attempting to capture.",1106352000,39,3566,4.499224806201551
1944896,5,B0000TPADS,"Many years ago I saw this magnificent movie in a theater and have been searching for it ever since. I was thrlled to learn that it is in the Amazon Prime collection. My husband and I just watched it on my new i-Pad and set aside everything else we were supposed to be doing because the music, the voices, the performance and the production are totally captivating -  brightly colored with more than a touch of irony and sadness.

1944898,2,B0000TPADS,"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, has alway been a favorite cabaret performance. I happened into one evening in the Village not really knowing what it was, before hand. The music is both delightful and searching. But for some strange reason every time a wonderful musical is put on film, it takes on a single person's interpretation of the piece. And, true to form this one bombs out. Listen to the original cast recording, without visual embellishments, and you might find it a great work of art. The film is not!",1440460800,,532,4.610526315789474

1944903,1,B0000TPADS,I have seen Jacques Brel ... twice on stage in Chicago and I suppose comparing this movie to that experience is unfair but even discounting any comparison this movie was just plain annoying.

1944938,2,B0000TPADS,I was extremely disappointed in the DVD.  I saw the stage production in NYC years ago - and that production was vibrant.  The songs are so original and the lyrics so poignant.

1944943,5,B0000TPADS,"This is more of a vignette based ""musical"" than a typical Hollywood style. It introduces us non-French speaking people to a wonderful poet of life and his works in a visual form. This is an early collection of music videos before they were called that, with a plot line thread through out. Well done,good stuff!!",1346889600,,312,4.6909090909090905

1944945,4,B0000TPADS,"I had the joy of being in a college production of the show back in 1980; it was my first exposure to Brel, and I fell in love with him on the spot.  I cannot count the number of times I have listened to both the original cast recording and the recording made of our performance. Even while in that production, I heard ""how bad"" the film version was, so I always avoided it.  Finally, 30+ years later, curioisity got the best of me and I watched it.  I had very mixed feelings about it.  My biggest complaint is that several of the songs from the stage version are missing, and others are inserted, likewise, the sequence of the songs has been changed. Visually, the film belongs to the avante-garde style of its time: forced symbolism, surrealistic transitions, odd camera angles, etc.  Accept it for what it is.  But what makes this film worth watching are the performances of Eli Stone and Mort Schumann, the two people primarily responsible for popularizing Brel in the US. As an added treat, Brel himself makes an appearance singing ""Non quitte pas"". Is this the film version of the show that I would make were I the director? No. But it does serve as a visual record of the original performers in the context of the era in which it was created.",1303516800,,1249,4.456140350877193
1944985,5,B0000TPADS,"I have been waiting for decades for this to be available on CD. I have it on vinyl, and cassette, and now at last I can listen to it wherever and whenever I want. The other recorded versions of the show are OK - but this is by far the best of them, in my opinion.

Ellie Stone and Mort Shuman are absolutely the perfect voices for these Brel songs, but most of all I love the rendition of ""Ne me Quitte Pas"" by Brel himself, in the September years of his life. I have at least four versions of him singing this song and listening to them, as they were recorded over the years, one can feel the changes that age, wisdom, and experience brought to the man. This final version (while he was already suffering from lung cancer, perhaps?) is Brel's anthem and obituary all in one. The power of his fully mature voice, and the emotion in the small catches and phrasing can bring me to tears.",1294358400,2,885,4.205882352941177
1944986,3,B0000TPADS,"The recording is old, but then again it was filmed in the 70's...But the theatrical and drama style is everything Jacques Brel would want it to be.
Jacques makes an appearance and make the movie fun. There is not a specifically plot to all that happen, but if you watch each number individually, you can get the theatricality of Brel.
The actors are not better than either of Off-Broadway and Stratford, Canada versions. ""Madaleine"" is one of my favorite songs, and they sing it so fast and crazy that I could better understand it...
I enjoyed, as I would enjoy Brel in any form and possible way!",1280102400,,596,4.579439252336448

1944989,1,B0000TPADS,"This video is an insult to the work of Jacques Brel. The production is a dated and poorly produced representation of his poetry. I would much rather have seen the actual stage performance filmed than the collage of stage and second rate images presented in this DVD.  I realize that the production reflects the thinking of the late 1960's and early 1970's of Hair and Godspell and this DVD is simply a reproduction of that period productioin, but as much as I like Brel's work, I doubt I will watch it again.",1189900800,5,508,4.521739130434782
1944990,4,B0000TPADS,"Jacques Brel was a genius singer-songwriter-troubador. The Englished off-Broadway adaptation of his work that opened in 1968 was brilliant; it's combination of poetry, music and movement -- all hung on a kind of loose thematic narrative -- had a very broad appeal: It ran for over 7 years. I saw a local semi-professional revival a few years ago that was terrific.

That said, a funny thing happened to this production on the way to the movies in 1974. Even with two of the original stars (and adapters), it couldn't avoid the temptation to become some mediocre hybrid of 70s counterculture sensibility and Broadway musical comedy.

Counterculture doesn't mean bad. In places the film achieves what it TRIES hard to achieve throughout: a poetic video rendition of the songs. The setting of ""Marieke"" with a lone singer and a little girl in a cemetery is particularly moving. The director wisely had the three soloists stand stll (against a backdrop of stars) for the grandiose finale of ""If We Only Have Love""

Adding a clip of Brel himself performing ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" was also a master stroke -- but one that exposes the mediocrity of the film production. When I ordered this DVD, I also bought ""Infiniment,"" a great two-CD compilation of Brel singing Brel released in 2003. It's so much more powerful--even if, like me, you have to rely on the supplied translations from the French.

Four stars anyway, because the original stage production was so good that it shined through.",1188518400,11,1480,4.884462151394422

I bought the DVD with Elly Stone and company because I was curious to see the show in action.  I don't think the original was as good as the revival this past year.  Maybe it was the way it was filmed, you know too movie-ish, rather than filming a live production of the show.  And it didn't seem the cast on the DVD was having any fun.  Its okay, but I'd like to see the recent NY company filmed on stage.  I think they were having a good time making the CD!  Also, I would like to see a company in Las Vegas produce this show.

I am not saying this to sound critical of it, but only to point out that I think only fans of Brel will find this interesting. I viewed it because this was a show we did when I was in high school and I was reliving the memories of years gone by. There are some catchy songs in it, and if you like Jacques Brel you'll love it.
