1063548,5,6305746583,"This is my kind of movie. Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller are simply fantastic in the title roles.  If you like action adventure movies, you've got to give this one a try.  If you like period pieces, such as: Barry  Lyndon, and The Adventures of Robin Hood you should enjoy this film.  I  know I did.  The filmmaker tried to inject 20th century sensibility into  eighteenth century dialog, probably to add some humor, if that doesn't  bother you there's nothing standing in the way of your enjoying this film.",961200000,,514,4.633333333333334
1063549,4,6305746583,"This is probably my selection for the sleeper movie of 1999. I went past the movie in the video store and saw that Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, Ravenous, The Full Monty) was in the movie and decided to take a  chance.
I would probably give a 4 1/2 to this if it were possible,  everything was done well, acting, directing and especially writing, which  is very often lacking in movies these days.
The out of place piece of the  movie was the language, which was often completely modern, used effectively  for humor, especially the modern swearing.
Plunkett is a highwayman who  loses his partner to the bad guy (Chance, played by Ken Stott) and hooks up  with Macleane, who has connections in high culture (i.e. money). They go on  a crime spree and become well known. Chance makes it a personal point of  honor to catch them.
The action was good, the characters were superb, the  villan was evil and mean. What more can I say? It is well worth your time.",960854400,3,957,4.543859649122807
1063550,3,6305746583,"Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller are great actors, and they do an admirable job with this piece of period pulp. They've both been in better movies, but seem to have had a particlarly good time making this one. I  guess that robbing the rich is more fun for them than being heroine junkies  in ""Trainspotting."" Liv Tyler is pretty as always, and she's a  good actress as well, but her role in this film is shallow and lackluster -  something that should be attributed to the screenplay, not her.
This is a  modern day swashbuckler where the good guys are outlaws and the bad guy  (Ken Stott) is just a truly manipulative, nasty person. There's nothing  really original about this film, but it is fun to watch and shows promise  for Jake Scott as a director. It doesn't aspire to greatness, so it's easy  to grant a little leeway.
You probably won't find anybody saying that  it's the best movie they've seen but they certainly won't say that it's  awful.
The DVD is a bit weak on added features - the featurette does not  include anything that you couldn't really get out of the movie on your own.  It is, however, kind of interesting to see the difference between the UK  and the US trailers for the film. Overall, a decent rental.",959817600,4,1235,4.479820627802691
1063551,5,6305746583,"A mediaeval costume dram with a notable difference - twentieth century speak transposed to the 18th century in this visually satisfying and atmospheric tale of two gentlemen highwaymen who robbed from the rich  aristocracy for their kicks! But the dialogue and the loud thumping techno  music gives it an appeal to the older teenage generation who might not  appreciate it if it were done in the style of, say, THE MAN IN THE IRON  MASK. The highway robbery scenes are superbly done, Robert Carlyle and  Jonny(LOVE HONOUR AND OBEY) Lee Miller relish their roles, acting as  frivolously and as over the top as they can! Liv Tyler wears some  particularly busty costumes as well. Filmed in London, Czech republic and  Spain for the mediaeval building settings of old London and Newgate prison,  this action-packed drama is best enjoyed on DVD for its soundtrack and  atmospheric effects. Not to be missed!",957571200,5,903,4.96

1063553,4,6305746583,"For those of us looking for a different kind of adventure, Plunkett & Macleane fits the bill.  I wasn't sure what to expect beyond the known premise of this being the story of notorious 18th century English  highwaymen. What I discovered in my first viewing was not only the talents  of the cast, but a visual feast as well.  Updated with modern  ""slang"", an uptempo soundtrack (that cleverly mixes the relevant  classical fare with modern electronics), and authentic looking costumes and  scenery, this one swept me away to another time and place.  Robert Carlyle  and Jonny Lee Miller make a great team (again, as in  ""Trainspotting"") as the title characters, and display versatility  in each of their roles....from the funny moments weaved throughout, to the  dire consequences of their characters' actions, and finally to the loyalty  of friendship. Liv Tyler, who's role as Lady Rebecca is not as dimensional  as the leads, pulls it off well enough.  All in all, I was pleased with  this film, even with any minor flaws it contains (all being more in form  with the sometimes uneven pace of the story, rather than the acting  itself). Stereotypes do abound (esp. the artistocrats)in this movie, as do  some gruesome violence, which could have both perhaps been a little less  exaggerated. But, who's perfect?  Finally, though Plunkett & Macleane  is not the type of film everyone will enjoy, those of us with a taste for  scoundrels' adventures long ago will find it generally satisfying.",955324800,5,1493,4.955465587044534
1063554,5,6305746583,Plunkett & Macleane was a film I have never heard of but I rented it because the Trainspotting boys were together again. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Caryle played out their role extremely well. It was action filled  and seductive as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone who comes  across it!,953596800,,299,4.622641509433962
1063555,4,6305746583,"Starting in a dingy English drunk pen, you may easily mistake this for an every day, run-of-the mill medieval type yarn.  However you'd be very much mistaken.  18th century scenery give way to 20th century language (Hence  the 15 certificate). A fast paced plot bring together Plunkett (Carlyle) an  ex-apothecarist and violent type, with Macleane, a pauper who desperately  wants to be a gentleman.  Together they create a crime wave, 'robbing from  the rich and that's it'  An all round gem of a film, with several notable  stand alone scenes, foremost of which is the dance scene.  Incredible  outfits in a beautiful 18th century ballroom to the sounds of drum, bass  and keyboard.  Truly a unique turn on what could easily have been another  tired old ball.  All actors put on sterling performances both the 'good  guys' and the 'baddies'.  Great script, superb costumes, a marvellous film.",952992000,18,894,4.9727891156462585

1063625,5,6305746583,"If you're thinking about getting this movie for whatever reason and still on the fence about it, I'd absolutely recommend it!

Since I discovered Once Upon a Time on Netflix I've been on a Robert Carlyle kick, trying to track down pretty much anything he's been in that's actually available in the states...so, yes, he is literally the only reason I was willing to pay almost $30 for a used copy of this movie that sounded vaguely interesting (or possibly just campy and dumb) but not particularly worth $30.

My personal agenda in seeing this out of the way, this was a surprisingly fun movie and I'm not sorry I spent the money at all. It's exciting and fast paced with interesting characters. No, it is not a historically accurate portrayal of the time, even aside from the music; if that's what you want, you misread the synopsis and are very much looking at the wrong movie. It has fun with the time period, fun with the costumes, and fun with the music. I really enjoyed it and I'd absolutely recommend it for someone who wants to just enjoy a movie and root for some (mostly) good guys and look forward to the bad guys getting what's coming to them, without too much angst along the way. Having purchased this movie solely for Robert Carlyle, I found I enjoyed all of the actors, especially Alan Cumming, who's character did not play out the way I'd thought he would when he first appeared.

The one 'warning' I might put out there is that, especially in the beginning, it is rather graphically violent and just...gross. This movie more or less starts (do I have to post SPOILERS if I'm only talking vaguely about the first 5-10 minutes? Here it is, if you think I do...) with someone getting killed when another character shoves their thumb through his eye and they show and let you hear more than I really wanted to considering I'd sat down to watch this movie over dinner. Basically the next scene is the main characters digging up the body of the guy killed in the first scene, maggot-ridden empty eye socket and all, and cutting the corpse's stomach open to get a ruby he'd swallowed.

...I was concerned that this movie might be a little too gory, but that was the last of the on-screen gore that I can remember, and it had to have all been over in the first ten minutes if not the first five; the rest of the movie was just...like I said, fun, so I really wouldn't let that put you off.

So there's some gore, but it's over quickly. There's some sex, but it's not all about that. Probably there was some bad language, but unless it's every other word that doesn't usually make much of an impression on me. Ultimately, I just really liked this movie. It was light and exciting and colorful and fun. I do wish there had been a sequel, I think it could have been equally fun to find out what happened next. And I would have loved to get a new copy with extras but sometimes you take what you can get.",1412467200,,2911,4.423507462686567
1063626,2,6305746583,"I came for a happy-go -lucky, 17th century good vs. evil romp and found instead a mostly savage, insanely violent mess of a film. The script is occasionally good, but lacks depth and is missing some essential scenes so provides no decent resolution at the end. The actors do a great job with what they have - the staging/lighting/shooting is wonderful - but the anachronistic score ultimately does it in completely.

Reunited Trainspotters Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller along with Alan Cumming, and Ken Stott play their roles wonderfully. The movie is action packed and while a tad predictable at times and not 100% historically accurate still a blast plus in combination with what I feel is an addictive soundtrack on a whole Plunkett & Macleane is to quote the commonly used movie phrase a bloody good laugh.

The character's antics are hilarious.  The wedding feast scene has to be one of the funniest scenes of the movie.

I searched for the DVD and was mortified to find that it was selling for almost $100.  However, I happened to be in a neighborhood audio visual shop that sold used DVD and there it was for $5.  Yipee!!

1063689,4,6305746583,"Jake Scott, son of Ridley, directed this grand tale of gentlemen bandits set in the mid 18th century. Even in the opening frames you can see he has a flare for his father's way of making things look. The sets, costumes and sense of framing all look much like something Ridley would have put together.

Quite simply put, Johnny Lee Miller plays a threadbare ""gentleman"" cooling his heels in a cell on a charge of drunkenness. The cell door is demolished by a wheel which has come off a coach as it is being robbed by one Robert Carlyle. The two meet and begin a life of crime that entails robbing the rich and giving it to.....well....themselves. The idea is to garner enough wealth to start a new life in America. During an early robbery, Miller encounters Liv Tyler and it's love at first sight. Can he complete his plan with his partner AND bring Liv into the picture?

This is a gorgeous movie. Every frame is a feast for the eyes. Maybe too much so. It's not until the second half that we start to get a feel for the characters. Prior to that everyone is swallowed up by the sets and costuming. The story is good enough. The robberies could have been more clever I suppose but they're not bad. And you do get to like those you are to like and hate those you are to hate. But this packs a lot of energy. It also has a lot of anachronisms in costuming and in the soundtrack. Maybe not quite as much as ""A Knight's Tale"" but enough to endear it to a younger crowd. It also has a good cast. Along with the above mentioned,you have Michael Gambon, Ken Scott and Tommy Flanagan, all turning in good performances. Jake Scott only has one other feature film under his belt which makes this a bit of an oddity. But as a first shot he's done a great job.

This is a lot of fun. It won't change your life but it's well worth the time it takes to view it.",1316390400,,1847,4.2266288951841355
1063690,4,6305746583,"This is one of those movies that for some reason did not achieve notable success : why not is a mystery.  The story line involves a down and out member of the gentry and a second man of the lower classes who is also broke, both of whom are sent to debtor`s prison in 18th century England. Through rather interesting turns of events, they stumble on a fortune while in prison, are released and re-establish themselves as upstanding members of upper crust society in need of a prodigious income to support their lifestyle. Of course they become the most notorious highway robbers in all of England by holding up mostly wealthy nobility as they travel about in carriages at night. This movie has a great cast of wildly diverse characters and is replete with both subtle and not so subtle humor.

1063731,4,6305746583,"PLUNKETT & MACLEANE has a purpose: entertainment. And during a season of rush and deadlines this little film provides enough anachronistic pleasures to fill a relaxing evening.

The story is simple: two social polar opposites with reasons for distaste for society join forces to rob the rich.  And all the rest is fantasy and period tongue in cheek humor.  Jonny Lee Miller is the cleaner of the two and Robert Carlyle the scruffy intuitive thief.  The two fall under different influences piloted by such fine actors as Liv Tyler, Alan Cumming, and Michael Gambon.

This is high rolling farce with a silly but fun musical score and wonderful period costumes and mannerisms.  It is not deep, it is not particularly good, but it IS entertaining.  This kind of fluff leaves you whistling with a smile. Grady Harp, December 05",1135209600,4,822,4.870503597122302
1063732,3,6305746583,"The big-screen debut of director Scott, whose only other directorial credit is the short-lived television series ""The Hunger,""  is the son of the sometimes-brilliant Ridley Scott. Reuniting Carlyle (who charmed the world in *The Full Monty*) and Miller, who appeared together in *Trainspotting*, it is a somewhat disjointed affair that can be a pleasure to watch, nonetheless. With spectacular art direction, and some dazzling effects, the camerawork can be dizzying as well as captivating. Scott interjects certain modern elements of music and cinematic that can have a jarring effect in this period piece. Aside from a deplorable title (the name sounds too much like *Tango and Cash* or *Turner and Hooch*), this tale of an ill-matched pair of highwaymen, as lush and romantic as it is, leaves something to be desired. With elements of *Robin Hood*, *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*, as well as *Batman*, it is an ambitious undertaking. The leads seem to do their best, and are engaging as the rogues, but the story rapidly becomes preposterous and you often find yourself wondering if you missed something. Then there's Liv Tyler. What can we say about Liv? That she's very good for her age? That someday she may be a fine actress? The truth of the matter is, that except for her lineage (such as it is), she is only one of the flood of lovely and somewhat inept starlets that have had a brief moment of attention lately. Always a pleasure to look at, she would do well to introduce a new facial expression (or two) into her repertoire. Alan Cumming, who won the Tony for his portrayal of the emcee in *Cabaret*, is flamboyantly superb as Lord Rochester, Claire Rushbrook has a gem of a role as the wealthy and syphilitic Lady Estelle, and Ken Stott is despicable as the sadistic chief of police. Shot in Prague, Spain and London, the locations serve the film perfectly, but the pop-synth music is at odds with the period, and even though it occasionally adds excitement, overall, it's distracting. Not a bad debut, overall, and a hint of the surprises Scott has in store for us.",1106438400,,2086,4.826815642458101
1063733,5,6305746583,"The first time I saw this film, I was deeply confused. Just what was up with the costumes? And the music? The second time through, when I actually watched the screen instead of the sewing machine, it made so much more sense. Aha! They weren't goign for accuracy at all! I can go with this, support it even, despite the fact that I am one of the biggest costume snobs I've ever met. Just go with it.

The biggest thing I noticed was that the only ones that got the seriously wrong costumes were the highest, smartest set, the ones that knew the rules and broke every one of them. In every part of their lives. I actually saw it as a way of pointing out to a population that probably would have seen truly accurate costume as merely quaint or stuffy, and that was not the attitude these people had. So you add a few modern touches, and really, it doesn't detract from the general mood they're trying to convey.

The same thing kind of applies to the music, but you know, it's really just a good soundtrack. Apparently, baroque and techno can do quite well together, and have a lot of fun in the process. I'm still upset that the jail scene song isn't on the CD though.

I find it deeply, terrribly funny that Alan Cummings' part bore the name of Rochester. The only other infamous Rochester I can think of was a 17th century poet who wrote the dirtiest, most obscene, most openly bi-sexual lyrics I've read that date to before the 20th century. So the eyebrow piercing was maybe a little much, but hey, it looked just swell on him with those incredible coats.

Plot? Who needs plot? Seriously though, there was one. It's just a very, very common one. Think Robin Hood, or pirates, or simply highwaymen. They all have the same plot, and it never goes out of style. There's a reason for that--it's all great fun, and sometimes you get a moral, sometimes you don't, and sometimes they dance the Tyburn Jig and all the pretty ladies weep. It all amounts to the same thing. The point is always just to have fun, and a good laugh.",1096329600,3,2022,4.384
1063734,2,6305746583,"There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives.  Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.
The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.
Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting.  The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair.",1054771200,,621,4.904761904761905
1063735,3,6305746583,"The unfortunate thing about this movie is that with the exception a a few brief moments, the music ruins this funny and well done film.
I am not fussy about my music, I loved Moulin Rouge and I have no problem with modern music in period style films, as long as that music is GOOD music.
The problem is that the music in this film is absolutly horrid!
The cast and the crew should have killed the composer for doing what he did to this film. There are scenes that get lost in the noise of the loud and obnoxious score.
It is really too bad because if you can somehow manage to ignore the music(and that is a very hard thing to do) it is a very funny movie with a great cast.
I think the only other problem I had was the passing of the jewel scene that seemed so ridiculously idiotic and much too long.
I won't buy this DVD because I just couldn't stand to hear the music again. IF they ever try to do a deluxe version of this film, not likely as it bombed, I would suggest they tank the entire score except the last few minutes and redo it. The funny thing is most of the reviews I read when the movie came out said the same thing, good film except the score.",1027987200,,1159,4.043478260869565
1063736,4,6305746583,"Plunkett & Macleane caught me by surprise. The trailer opened with typical period drama pretentiousness before turning into a punkish, rebellious wild ride. When I went to see it at the cinema (during its extremely limited theatrical run) I hadn't even planned on it that day. I just turned up in time and decided to take a chance. A wise choice indeed, as I was in a bad mood that day and this movie really cheered me up.

It's London, it's 1748, Robert Carlisle and Johnny Lee Miller play the titular highwaymen from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Will Plunkett brings the highway know-how while Captain James Macleane makes the connections to high society. Lord Gibson takes personal offense to their antics after being robbed, but her Niece Lady Rebecca (the lovely Liv Tyler) falls in love with Macleane, and his unusual gentlemanly ways. Ken Stott plays the truly vile Chance, the police inspector determined to see the men hang at any cost, and one of the nastiest villains in recent film history.

Jake Scott (son of Ridley, nephew of Tony) directs with a style that fuses Gothic tones with post-modernism. This is no Pride and Prejudice. Plunkett & Macleane is glam rock on acid while retaining all of the usual gritty, earthy production designs of previous Ridley/Tony films. Amazingly, Jake Scott would not direct another film until 11 years after this got released.

There is a strange rumor persistent on the Internet that Plunkett & Macleane (inspired by true story, don't you know) began life as a completely different film. I recall seeing production stills in magazines in 1996 (three years before its release), and there have been suggestions that it was originally called 'The Lady Highwayman' with Liv Tyler as the lead and Carlisle and Miller merely as supporting characters. The original screenplay by Selwyn Roberts apparently featured bizarre mathematical subtext before being heavily re-written by Bond-scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. I'm not sure if any of the original material made it into the final, 99-minute, cut of the film.

A score by Trevor Jones was also apparently rejected in favor of Craig Armstrong. While I have no idea what Jones may or may not have recorded for this film, there is no doubt that Armstrong's work is utterly amazing, probably his career best.

Plunkett & Macleane seems to have fallen into obscurity since its release. Don't let it pass you by though, it's loads of fun and deserved a wider audience.",1016928000,7,2471,4.930288461538462
1063737,1,6305746583,"I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.
The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film.",996537600,2,344,4.2272727272727275
1063738,3,6305746583,"The only time you'll see tracks on anyone's arms here is when they are unceremoniously run over by a mid-18th century horse cart. First time director Jake Scott (read: Kelly Lynch, Sofia Coppola) borrows the keys to the studio and produces a fairly rollicking debut with ""Plunkett & MacLeane"". Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller take thier ""Trainspotting"" schtick to 1750's England as a pair of rogueish and rascally highwaymen, stealing valuables from silly foppish aristocrats. Miller finds time along the way to fall head over heels (who wouldn't?) for lucious Liv Tyler, as the daughter of a bigwig Chief Justice. That's about as complicated as the cartoonish plot gets, but Scott directs with infectious energy and a bit of a wink at the audience, so you may find yourself entertained in spite of a rather thin narrative. If you are the scholarly type who likes to nitpick at historical inaccuracies-you'd best steer clear of this one...if the 18th century characters spouting Tarantino style dialogue doesn't make you crazy, the incongruous music soundtrack is sure to put you over the edge (no harpsichords or minuets were harmed in the making of this film). An honorable mention goes to the ever engaging Alan Cumming,sporting a spooky physical resemblance to Pee Wee Herman and attacking his role as a decadent dandy with much aplomb.",988156800,10,1344,5.058558558558558
1063780,5,6305746583,"It appears most of the reviewers are saying this is a good movie that is failed by the style in which the director mixed elements of the period and modern times. I would argue, however, that this is what makes the movie such a grand and wonderful adventure. The cast work brilliantly with each other, and the two main characters were developed to the point that the audience cares about them, and during certain points of the film I could not help myself from cheering, out loud, their successes. The soundtrack is marvelous and worth appreciating on its own. If you want a serious and stuffy period piece, then this movie is definitely not for you, but if you want to be entertained and taken on a ride through the adventurous lives of highwaymen and aristocrats, I couldn't recommend a movie higher than ""Plunkett & Macleane"".",981072000,,828,4.678082191780822
1063781,4,6305746583,"Macleane huddles, singing snatches of drunken song, in the debtor's prison. Hearing a noise, he stands up and peers out the window, just in time to see a wagon wheel hurtling out of the mist with surreal speed towards him. Thus begins ""Plunkett and Macleane"", a wild, adventurous romp through the 18th century. This movie surprises and treats over and over again. Don't be put off by the grisly disinterment that takes place within the first ten minutes of the film. Stick with it.
I've been a fan of Robert Carlyle since I saw ""The Full Monty"". In fact, I neglected to mention him as one of the perks of the movie when I reviewed ""Ravenous"". The part of Will Plunkett is one that he plays with relish and realism. He and Jonny Lee Miller's Macleane have a love/hate relationship from the start, but somewhere along the way a real friendship develops. They form a partnership in which Macleane, an upper-class clergyman's son fallen on hard times, finds out where the rich pickings are. Then, as the ""Gentleman Highwayman"", he and Plunkett ""rob the rich...and that's it.""
The supporting cast features: Ken Stott, as an absolutely despicable adversary; Liv Tyler (one of the few weak spots in the film, in my opinion; she's pretty but her character lacks depth); and a thoroughly delicious Alan Cumming. Perhaps Cumming is getting a bit typecast (he played the same sort of role in ""Titus""), but he's just so good at it!
Several reviewers have already mentioned the ball scene with the techno-electronica music. It's surprising, but it works. Think of ""Orlando"", another movie that took an unorthodox approach to score music. At times this movie is like a long version of the Adam Ant video ""Stand and Deliver"", and parts of it are anachronistic, but it's a LOT of fun.",971827200,,1768,4.762214983713355
1063782,5,6305746583,"i have always had a soft spot for the period movie, but some are better than others. this one is not a typical period movie. although it is set in the highwayman era, there are alot of modern influences that appear throughout the film. these influences will make it a love it or hate it type of film for many. personally i very much enjoy the way they put this film together, the characters are all interesting, and where the story does lack the characters continue to drive the film along. a exciting swashbuckling tale and very much worth the watch. my only real complaint is a dvd somewhat deviod of extras.",969580800,,610,4.455357142857143

But when Macleane falls in love with the  daughter of their unbelievably wealthy victims (Liv Tyler), things get a  little out of hand.
Plunkett and Macleane is tremendous, charming fun in  a superbly old fashioned way. It is a movie that deserves praise for its  performances, direction and memorable dialogue. Highly recommended!",969148800,2,563,5.476744186046512
1063784,4,6305746583,"Superb and superb again! Jake Scott has not made a documentary, he has  taken us for a look into the 18th century, and has slapped us against the  lens of Hogarth to do it.  Anachronisms? Yes! They illustrate for him,  he has laid them in our path like beacons, they aren't mistakes! We are all  awash with them, they have to be made into tools; I know this, having been  an 18th century re-enactor for many years. Plunkett and Macleane shimmers  and stinks, is glorious and gory.  The genius here is not just that he  takes the viewer with him into Hogarth's land, it is that he leaves us  there.",968112000,,597,4.345454545454546
1063785,4,6305746583,"When I first saw this movie in a theater on Kensington High Street in  London, I wasn't overly impressed. Despite the novelty of being within a  few miles of where the action was supposed to take place, I couldn't get  past the preposterous plot, howling historical inaccuracies and misplaced  modern references, such as body-pierced openly bisexual nobility,  gratuitous use of 20th century swearing and expressions, and last but not  least a throbbing MTV soundtrack in an 18th-century period piece.
But  now, back in the States, watching it on DVD with my kids, it all seems to  make sense in a strange sort of way, and I find the movie highly  entertaining and watchable!  Maybe it's because I can accept it now for  what it is:  A movie designed for mindless fun, with no pretention toward  anything else. In any case, it's worth a look...just give it more than one  chance.
One interesting side-note:  The DVD has both UK and US trailers  for the film, and it's interesting to see how a movie like this is marketed  from one country to the other.  Let's just say there's a big difference!",965347200,2,1094,4.698412698412699
1063786,3,6305746583,"This movie is highly enjoyable action and adventure. Miller and Carlyle are an excellent team and manage to give really good performances with a  less-than-excellent script. Some of the period detail is extremely  interesting (what period detail there is). The reason I gave it three stars  instead of four are: 1)There is some really disgusting, out-of-the-ordinary  violence in it; 2)The anachronisms are kind of annoying (would even a rich  aristocrat admit he ""swings every way"" when homosexuality was a  hanging offense? Would a young lady of fashion leave off powdering her hair  when *everyone* powdered?) and 3) the plot is pretty thin. However, it is  fun and undemanding entertainment, and if you're not in a critical mood  should do just fine for a video date.",965001600,,771,5.104

1063789,5,6305746583,"Plunkett & Macleane is a well directed and visually stunning film with a killer soundtrack. On the verge of being hilariously grotesque along the lines of ""Trainspotting"" yet intriguing in a dramatic sense, this  movie shines where the others don't. The setting of London is portrayed  nearly perfect for the time period where the two thieves steal just because  they can. The soundtrack that backs the drama & action is beautifully  composed by Craig Armstrong, who gives it a classical feeling with the  tinge of electronica overtones.
