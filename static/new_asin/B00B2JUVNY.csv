Please work out whatever you need to, Production/Amazon, and offer this film for rent or purchase within Instant Video. Until then... I'll keep waiting.",1374969600,2,274,4.612244897959184
5553081,1,B00B2JUVNY,"Poor script, poor acting, poor directing and editing.

The only reason I sat through this movie was to look at the Russian River area scenery. I wish I had driven around there in real life instead of wasting my time on this movie.

This getting released straight to DVD tells you something.",1370563200,,290,4.5576923076923075

5553083,5,B00B2JUVNY,"Wasn't expecting too much as mostly young inexperienced actors. I was pleasantly surprised, no sex or nudity, except for some off color language would be good for family.  Beautiful northern California setting. Some reviewers attempt to show how smart they are by attempting to spoil the plot. There's one or two in every crowd.",1367798400,4,328,5.074074074074074

5553085,2,B00B2JUVNY,"While two brothers were out deer hunting Nate Towne (Spencer Treat Clark), the older of the two, accidentally shoots and kills Mayor Cavanaugh. Skylar (Nick Eversman) the younger of the siblings, opts to take the rap because he is a minor. Their father Bloom is the sheriff (Ted Levine) in a town that is literally owned by the Cavanaughs.

To twist things more, the Mayor's wife insists young Skylar be tried as an adult. Nate, the trigger man, is the boyfriend of the Mayor's daughter he shot and the deputy (Martin Starr) is a Cavanaugh, who seems to be interested in real justice.

The incident opens up a past sore, one unknown to the boys. Eventually the film becomes a man hunt for Butch and Sundance as one can deduce from the cover.

The plot of the film is interesting and had enough complexity for a decent indie. Unfortunately it was not well developed. Likewise characters were never developed and the dialouge went through the motions. While things were happening on the screen, I found myself waiting to for this thing to end.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1367625600,3,1085,4.6947368421052635
5553086,1,B00B2JUVNY,"Rarely has one movie had so many characters doing so many stupid things.  DEEP DARK CANYON is such a movie.
Writer/directors Abe Levy and Silver Tree have concocted a movie that is both convoluted and derivative, complete with unbelievable and unlikeable characters.
Caught in this mess are Nick Eversman and Spencer Treat Clark as the whiny and witless brothers handcuffed in a ""Defiant Ones"" rip-off; the usually reliable Ted Levine as their zombie-like sheriff dad and Scooby Doo's Matthew Lillard stopping by as a nerdish attorney.
And the vigilante posse couldn't hit the broad side of the proverbial barn.
This nonsense climaxes with a choose yout own ending!
The supposed thriller has no thrills...it is redundant, dull and absurd.  DEEP DARK CANYON is just deeo dark doodoo.",1367107200,3,782,5.149606299212598

8561459,2,B00B2JUVNY,"Pretty lousy low budget indie about two brothers involved in what appears to be a hunting accident.  Unfortunately, the person killed was the town mayor, who basically owns everybody, so the decision is made to try the boy who confessed to firing the fatal shot as an adult, which isn't very believable considering that the boys are the sons of the local sheriff and that it's pretty much impossible to be tried for a hunting accident in this country.

Things get much dumber as one of the brothers tries to free the other while he is being transferred for arraignment.  They become wanted fugitives, pursued by the locals and by the law.

Deep Dark Canyon might not sound bad on paper but this is a film with literally no tension or suspense.  The filmmakers might have thought they were making a comedy, but Deep Dark Canyon isn't funny either.  The film is polished enough from a technical point of view and the cast is professional, but the script and direction betray filmmakers who have no idea whatsoever what kind of movie they wanted to make.  This is definitely not worth a look, but if you're tempted anyway and want to be very charitable you could probably compare it to southern drive-in fare from the 1970's as reimagined for the Hallmark Channel.",1460332800,,1261,4.678733031674208
8561460,1,B00B2JUVNY,"I gave this movie one star because amazon forces one to do so simple to write a review. Which is unfair because even 1 star implies that the movie has some merit to it and if one uses enough 1 star ratings and then averages them out together with the other 2 or more star ratings, what you get is a higher false positive rating that amazon then uses on the home page item description. In my opinion this was a fairly good film in spite of outright, obvious plagiarizem until something that the inexperienced husband and wife team of writers forgot to do and that was write an ending, instead they chose to rip off the final scene from, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid' and bastardize it then steal the rest of the movie from 2 other well known very famous films and kind of patched them together instead of using what's normally referred to as an imagination! In spite of this I found myself becoming attached to the two without hope teenagers all the way up to the unresolved Butch Cassidy kind of ending which absolutely ruined this what started out as a nice little gem but turned into a virus straight to video piece of sh__. I don't understand what they were thinking, that this was some kind of of artistic twisted thriller of an ending, well it wasn't, silly as well as a complete disturbing letdown. It ends like this- two teenagers running for there lives because the people who own everyone and everything in the town have decided that they are going to hunt them down and murder them,  I won't get into the rest of the plot it's not worth wasting my time, everyone can read the other reviews to get a fair idea of the storyline, at the end just like the Butch Cassidy movie they find themselves surrounded in a barn by the murderess Cavendah Clan whom all have serious intent on their demise when all of a sudden the kids bust out by driving a suv straight through the wall of the barn after about 5 seconds the screen goes completely white and the final credits roll. WHAT THE HECK!  What just happened here? well I'll tell you, the husband and wife team must have sobered up at this point and realized that they couldn't write and stopped. These unimaginative unfortunate writers plagiarized directly from 3 movies. The first a story that's been told in countless westerns and a few modern era movies in which a corrupt, murderess, warlord, dictator family owns and runs the entire town and of course they stold again directly from the Butch Cassidy ending but the one that really P. O. 's me is that they once again not just plagiarized from one of the greatest movies ever made,' The Defiant Ones 'a 50' s black and white film noir starring Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. These amatures didn't just rip off a few scenes they plagiarized about 70 percent of the entire film simply changing the main characters from chained adults to chained teenagers. What losers. The, 'Defiant Ones' is a protected film but if anyone cares to actually see it and how these two knuckleheads did nothing more then rip it off and throw in two parts from some other films I'm sure amazon offers it. Belive me even for the younger generations it's a great film. Everyone needs a little culture and especially if it relates to true, real time Americana articulated in the old Hollywood style of supreme story telling and film adaptations. NO STARS!!!!",1452902400,,3349,4.543046357615894
8561461,4,B00B2JUVNY,"2 boys go hunting and accidentally bag themselves a much loved Mayor who along with his family pretty much owns the town. Well, they won't hear anything about an accident and arrest the 2 boys whose father is the very ineffectual sheriff. The boys escape and let the chase begin and there are no rules it is hunt them down and kill them. By the way the scenery is gorgeous. the performances and especially by the 2 young men in question but I don't know the names of the 2 brothers but they are excellent and I would not mind seeing them again.",1441929600,,544,4.29126213592233

8561466,2,B00B2JUVNY,"I watched this for actor Spencer Treat Clark, whom I enjoyed in Last house On the Left (which I plan on reviewing in a bit). I agree with the others who said this was husband and wife hobbyists making a film. You can kind of see it when you watch this. I mean, I know it takes a good chunk of money to make a decent looking pic-one that doesn't look so low budget like this one does. For me, the plot here was just terrible, frankly. It was so....unimaginative and uncreative. and then I had to struggle through watching Ted Levine's character. that was painful to watch as his character wasn't developed AT ALL. also, Levine's character had such bizarre reactions to almost every situation. I remember watching a scene where he went looking for his boys (who were on the run), and his boss in the police department found him & put a loaded gun in his face, and Levine smiled. He SMILED.

And there were other scenes where Levine's character acted strangely. for one thing, a part of his background (which is really all we ever learn about him). Apparently, some big shot in town killed Levine's wife while driving drunk years ago and Levine helped cover up the killing so he could become Sheriff! Really? Really??? What husband helps cover up the killing of his own wife so he can get a promotion? It just doesn't seem rational or logical. Yes, some people do that in real life, but those are called sociopaths. His actions need to be explained and they never were. Plus he worked every day with the people who killed his wife, and said nothing! He showed no resentment towards them or anything. It was just another day for him I guess.

Then in another scene, his ""colleagues"" at the police station ( the ones associated with the guy that killed his wife) tell him his son is about to be tried for first degree murder, and he SMILED again, and then put handcuffs on his own son and said nothing. Bwuhahaha! I could go on all day with these weird reactions I've seen from this character because I've never seen anything like it in my life. It's just too crazy! In yet another scene, Spencer Treat Clark (who played the brother of the guy being tried for murder) got upset about their father (Levine) just smiling and being casual about it, and then Levine blew up at HIM for getting upset. It was just insanity.

We all know Ted Levine can act, but I don't get why he took this role. This didn't showcase any of his acting skills or elevate his professional reputation in any way, shape, or form. The cast was interesting and who knows? Maybe he wanted to work with Justine Bateman, who was in this mess of a film too. The cast was pretty good but the story and characters were off the wall. And poor Spencer Treat Clark had to run nonstop in this film, with little or no break. Was it worth it? He and Ted Levine should've run together away from this film. I adore Spence but this was just awful.",1419206400,,2898,4.402985074626866
8561467,4,B00B2JUVNY,"i happen to live in guerneville, california where a lot of this movie was shot so of course when it came out in theaters for one hot minute, i was curiosity bound to go see it.  i actually saw it twice on the big screen because i liked it so much i had to drag as many homies as possible to see it the second time.  everything about this film was surprisingly well crafted from production to cinematography (beautiful area), from story-line to writing and acting. as with many indie projects, this film should've gotten more recognition.",1416182400,,537,4.525773195876289
