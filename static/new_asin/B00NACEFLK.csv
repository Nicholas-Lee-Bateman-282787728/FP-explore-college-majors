8676756,3,B00NACEFLK,"Soft plot spoiler review, I give you an idea about the ending, although I omit the details.

K (Kane Kosugi) escapes from a swat team that can only come at him two at a time, although there are a dozen of them coming up the stairs. He leaps from his hotel room, bumps his head and joins an assassin cult group lead by The Minister (Rade Serbedzija). K kills for the minister, or else the janitor (Sahajak Boonthanakit) dies... and he dies too because there is an explosive in his chest. K has amnesia and flashbacks which likewise have nothing to do with the first film. K, who is not an MIB, wants out.

I am not sure how this tied into the first film other than the fact it takes place in the same city. There is less arena style fighting, i.e. the actually create a story instead of imitating a video game where you just fight. The end starts to get twisted and confused.

This ""sequel"" which isn't, was released 4 years after the first film so it may be a good thing that the two are not related...just kidding. Now it does leave us open for what promises to be an exciting Tekken 3 as he and the killer girl (Kelly Wenham) will have to take on the big cheese (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who was little more than a cameo.

Guide: No swearing. Implied sex. No real nudity. Women dancing in bikinis. Biljana Misic in a school uniform sucking on a pink Dum-Dum and dry humping, so the film wasn't all bad.",1427587200,,1401,4.295454545454546
