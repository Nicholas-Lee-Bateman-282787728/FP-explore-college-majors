3479954,4,B001B1UO7Q,The Hills have Eyes 1 is a great movie but the 2nd movie is a bit boring at the beginning until you get to the middle of the movie and then it starts to spice up a bit.,1434240000,,168,3.4473684210526314

3479958,4,B001B1UO7Q,"The Hills Have Eyes 1 has more of a simple story line, has fewer scares, and is less gruesome than part 2. Part 2 is more violent and bloodier, at the same time demonstrating the abusive parental mutant figure.",1405900800,2,210,4.410256410256411
3479959,5,B001B1UO7Q,"The Hills Have Eyes remake is brutal and relentless yet at its core its about the lengths a father will go to save his child. THAT is what makes this remake a standout. It might sound funny to say it but it's true: it has heart. Very well directed by Alexander Aja with a slew of great character actors under the make-up as the mutants.  It's pretty cool also that the action takes place at the nuclear test site in New Mexico.  This gives the movie a theme: We are the creators of our nightmares. The sequel The Hills Have Eyes 2 is not as good, yet it has its fair share of scares and an original plotline concerning a group of National Guard trainees preparing for their tour in Iraq by running maneuvers in the desert.  There are some scary parallels in the imagery here that we saw on the news each day during the dark times in the Iraqi War. As a theme it was not well defined what the message is here, but the imagery is nonetheless unsettling. I couldn't recommend you go out and buy Hills 2, but as part of a package horror double feature deal -- this DVD set is a definite BUY BUY for horror fans.",1243814400,6,1107,4.187793427230047
3479960,5,B001B1UO7Q,"What can I say. Trailer Vacation goes bad, National Guard gets called in to investigate. This is one night of terror!  We have an outdoor theater in our RV.  Other campers are drawn to our ""horror movie"" nights gets at Parks we stay at all over. As trailer camping goes, Hills Have Eyes 1 does not get any better !  Younger children should avoid both of these films, but seasoned horror geeks will love these films.",1482710400,3,415,4.434210526315789

3479964,5,B001B1UO7Q,"If you are really really brave then watch this by yourself in the dark alone. Otherwise, bring friends or wait until noon. The reason I watched this originally was to see if Hostel and Saw were a match for it. They were, but the reality of these films is that these are plausible survival scenaria. I bought these to take notes on survival, defense, tactics and general awareness. That was after I stopped holding my breath.",1463788800,,424,4.592105263157895

3479966,5,B001B1UO7Q,Here is a hell of a bargain an excellent 2 pk. of course the first one is by far the better movie but what an excellent bargain. If you love movies like Wrong Turn with lots of gritty gore and nasty looking mutated people here ya go. These movie deliver. Not for everyone but I think a gore fan will find some good entertainment value off of them.,1459209600,,347,4.117647058823529

8281497,4,B001B1UO7Q,"If this was based upon just the first movie, I'd give it 5 stars. The second movie was a little long. I wish it would have been written a little better. I am happy for the set, though. Even though, DVD quality, it still was good quality. Wes Craven, need I say more? For horror nuts, it's a good addition to your collection. If you don't care to have the set, I HIGHLY recommend the first movie in the least. I have always liked that one. 4 Star Rating.",1485129600,,453,4.101123595505618
