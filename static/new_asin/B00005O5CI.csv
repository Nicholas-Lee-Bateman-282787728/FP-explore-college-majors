1639490,5,B00005O5CI,"And so at last, Volume FOUR appears! I've been waiting for this one.
  First up, an episode that made the dub, the capture of the Power card at the local Zoo. Pretty much everything that was in the dub was what was in the Japanese folks!
  Second, one the dub missed, and it's hysterical! Sakura, Li, and Tomoyo-Chan go to Toya-Kun and Yukito-Kun's high school for a school festival. The true Hysteria comes when they go to see Toya and Yukito in a play, with all the roles gender-swapped! The girls are doing all the guys' parts, and the guys are doing all the girls' parts! And Toya's the lead! Did I mention it was ""Cinderella""? I just about _died_ when Yukito did his part! Sadly, the play is left unfinished due to the machinations of the first lethally dangerous card, the Mist card. You'll have to watch it to find out!
  Third up, another un-dubbed episode! We begin with the quick and clean capture of the Storm card(Li get's this one.), and afterward Sakura and Kero have a _big_ fight, leading Kero to raid a carton of alcohol spiked chocolates!(Frankly, the beer bottle shape of the candies should have been a clue!) When Kero wakes up from his little binge, he's in the room of a five to six year old little girl named Akane(No, not Akane Tendo, this girl's an only child and living in an aparment with her mother, not her father!) who found him sleeping on an old couch that was on the curb waiting for the trashmen. Fortunately she thinks he's a kitty, okay a flying kitty, but a kitty. This eventually leads us to the Float card, which makes little Akane's wish to fly come true. The only problem, it just floats, it has no directional control...unless you count...the wind...
  Finally, we have yet another ep. not in the dub version...that has no card capturing at all! It's summertime, and the Kinomoto's, plus Yukito, go out to a country house for the weekend, where Sakura meets a nice old man living just down the street in a really pretty house. Don't be alarmed by the seemingly negligence of Sakura's father...there's a very special secret about the old man that he already knows. A soft and tender ep. I recommend it!
  At last, the gap is filled. Next up...The First Movie!  See you then!!

1639491,5,B00005O5CI,"I am one of the biggest fans of this series. I absolutely adore Sakura and her friends and adventures. I own all of the current English Manga as well (five volumes, so far) and can't wait till Jan 15 for both this one and Magical Mystery (vol. 7). I was also one of the strongest voices against what KidsWB and Nelvana did to the English version of said. Accept no substitutes! Get uncut only, and that is sad to say as they are actually improving the dubbing of the second half of the series. There are great dubs in Animeland, but I object to the arbitrary cuts they made to the series (episode order, names changed, etc.) So thankfully we have the uncut to mirror the dubbed edition. So buy this DVD and the whole uncut collection. This series deserves its place on the list of great anime.",1009411200,,793,4.364864864864865
1639492,5,B00005O5CI,"As January 15 comes closer and closer, fans of this charming and wonderful story cheer with delight. The fourth volume is being released after months of delay. The package features a beautiful blue cover with Sakura in her wizard-like outfit that she wears for about five minutes in episode 14.
As I write this, I've only seen 3 of the four episodes on the DVD. They are great, and the fourth episode is very similar to the story told in the manga (which I've read)
*Sakura goes to the zoo with her classmates to do a report. Did you hear something coming from her bag? Anyway, But something is doing unimaginable things by flipping over the emperor penguin slide and trashing animal cages. Will Sakura win in an impossible game of tug of war?
*Touya's school festival is coming up but Sakura wasn't invited? She finds out why while watching a unique version of Cinderella with gender issues and a can of mackeral to boot. Things get even more out of hand when a mysterious card endangers Touya!
*Sakura and Kero get into a huge fight! Who's to blame? No one really, but Kero learns the consequences of alcohol abuse when the story of a little girl falls into play. Will he find his way home? Will Sakura forgive him? Why the heck is everything floating in the air?
*Summer vacation starts off with a relaxing trip to a beach house. There, Sakura meets an old man who claims she looks like his grand-daughter. Touching stories are revealed about the past with a rainbow that'll melt your heart. No clows cards will ruin the day this time!
Remember that this release is only available in Japanese with English subtitles. Also with the release of this title, the standard postcard is included, but Pioneer has promised us an extra special bonus for the delay. The first 10,000 copies come with a cute mini pencil board, but it is only available for a limited time only! ... Grab your copy now!",1005868800,8,1891,4.5811209439528024
1639493,5,B00005O5CI,"Many people are wondering why this volume (#4) is being released after volumes #5 and #6. Well, there's a reason: Cardcaptor Sakura is far ahead of American TV in the way it addresses gender identify. Previous volumes have referenced the same-sex relationship of Touya and Yukito, but the second episode in this volume addresses this issue far more directly than any American-made animated series. This episode (which also includes a hilarious rendition of ""Cinderella"" in drag) honestly and movingly ""outs"" their relationship in a way that will make the Jerry Falwells of this country want to fight the Pacific Conflict all over again. The other 3 episodes are also classics in this series, particularly the tender ""Rainbow of Memories."" Essential for anime fans and highly recommended for parents who want their kids to grow up in the real world, not the pre-1960 world of most American cartoons.",1001289600,,898,5.115646258503402
1639494,5,B00005O5CI,"I enjoy a lot this serie, I already see it, all the 3 seasons and I only can tell you is EXCELLENT, I am really happy, because they are giving all the SERIE UNCUT, and hope to have this DVD, I think this DVD is the 4 and include the POWER card and other 3 (I don't tell all the information, i don't want to spoil anything), also you will know  YAMASAQUI the character more funny, he enjoy to make fun of others telling interesting stories that are UNTRUE, lot of fun, enjoy it",997920000,3,476,4.0638297872340425

7948347,5,B00005O5CI,"The grand original! Sweet and compelling, this is the saga of a little girl who finds herself enmeshed in a magical world of cards! Magical cards which have escaped their bonds, and now flash about in many different guises, wreaking havoc. Young Sakura must re-capture the entire deck, using the powers of the cards she already has: with a little help from her magical sidekick, Kero-chan. His name is a bit of a joke; it's really Cerberus (""Keroberos""), but Sakura calls him by an affectionate diminuative construction of it.

The Americanized version,released as ""Cardcaptors,"" was heavily edited and even had dialogue re-written to make it more of a boy/girl show instead of primarily a ""Magical Girl"" series, even ""dumbed it down"" a bit in some ways. Appropriate for any age, the stories are easy to follow but tense and dramatic. Parents, you can enjoy watching them with the kids! In fact, I'd already been an anime fan when my kids got me into this! The stories and characters really drive this series, and put it several cuts above the average ""monster of the week"" anime in the Pokemon model.

The only thing I could list as a possible downside are the obligatory ""transformation"" scenes which turn little Sakura-chan into Cardcaptor Sakura. You do get them every episode, occasionally twice, if I recall. But this is standard for the genre and I think an ""anchor point,"" especially for the younger viewers. I don't mind it, but other older viewers might find it tedious, especially if you are watching a few eps at a time, and not just once a week, as originally intended.

Just a cautionary word -- Japanese culture has its own set of mores and taboos, as does the Western world. Sometimes the characters seem to express affection for each other in a way that Western ears might find suggestive. Remember, the main cast are only ten years old! For example, Sakura's friend Tomoyo who videotapes her adventures seems to have quite a crush on Sakura, although Sakura herself seems rather puzzled by this,and Syaoran Li, Sakura's classmate and rival Cardcaptor, seems to have a crush on the same teenage boy Sakura does! Not too much should be inferred though, as this in part reflects another convention of anime, showing that a character (the older boy) who seems to be secondary is actually much more important than he seems at first. There is no suggestive activity at all, just the occasional expressions of fondness. This is further complicated by the fact the Japanese word ""suki"" (pr. ""skee"") can be translated as either ""like"" or ""love,"" depending on the context or even on the translator. In any case, I doubt it anything startling enough that a younger viewer would even pick up on it, but if it is a concern, watch through the eps first and decide what bits (if any) you need to FF through! I'll say this, I AM a particular parent regarding this kind of thing, and I have NO problem with this series. It never even occured to me until I saw remarks about it elsewhere, and I was like, ""Surely you can't be serious!""

But bottom line -- this is a terrific series, full of heart, one of anime's real landmarks. It's a cliche`, but this really S a ""must-see.""",1369180800,2,3176,4.717117117117117
7948348,4,B00005O5CI,in this group of episodes it's funny to see the way that Sakura fights and some of the costumes are funny,1367366400,,105,4.0476190476190474
7948349,4,B00005O5CI,I liked this series much better than Cardcaptors.  It made a lot more sense and all of the sub-plots were there.,1197504000,,112,4.333333333333333
7948350,5,B00005O5CI,"I am thoroughly puzzled on the insistance that Touya and Yukito are revealed to be So Deeply In Truuuuuue Looooooove in this particular set of episodes. Not because I'm offended by the idea, mind you -- having watched plenty of anime (including the decidedly not-for-children Angel Sanctuary) I'm not exactly naiive -- but because the only way to -see- that the boys are SDITL is exactly that: you have to choose to see it that way.

Most younger kids (i.e. the age group at which this series is actually aimed) will watch it and giggle at the fact that the boys are in dresses and the fairy godmother is...well...not precisely the fairy they know. (I will say that it's nothing bad, just a silly surprise that I don't want to spoil.) Besides all of that, the play in the episode isn't actually all that long; plus there's the fact that Shakespeare is considered one of the Greats and -he- had at least two plays that involved men dressing as women and vice-versa.

As for the actual -anime-! This batch of episodes is mainly comprised of comedy, with some seriousness introduced by Touya's peril thanks to the Mist card. The last episode, with Sakura-chan's grandfather, is rather bittersweet -- probably moreso for parents than kids. It doesn't involve a card, and makes for a nice pause in the action. All in all, I'm glad to have this in my collection and am looking forward to the next volume.",1102291200,3,1398,4.65587044534413

7948352,5,B00005O5CI,"These four episodes not only capture cards but also give us greater insight into Sakura's family and friends.  The last one with her grandfather meeting her is both sad and sweet because she never learns who he is.  Another episode isn't what the background note claims: Sakura's brother doesn't dress like a girl to impress his best male friend, its part of the gender reversal of a high school play!  Its so sad that American television edited these so much, the relationships between characters may cross gender lines, age lines, and het lines but they are the most interesting part of the show.  I'm so glad my spouse got me to watch these with him.",1055203200,2,653,4.6521739130434785

*Power: In Tomeda's Penguin Park and zoo, something is wreaking cages, overturning slides and creating a LOT of havoc. Sakura has to ge this card- but does that mean she has to win a tug-of-war match with a CLOW CARD?*
*Mist: Sakura recieves a coupon for free food in her bro's festival- from Yukito. She goes, and sees a 'twisted' (O_o) version of Cinderella. But things become nasty when a acid green mist threatens both the play- and Touya! (P.S. Touya gets a date invitation)*
*Float: After a big fight, Kero eats some alchohol chocolates, then runs away. He is found by a lonely girl with no one to play with since her father dies. Float comes into play, and the little girl is convinced she can ge see her father in heaven. But will Sakura take Kero away from her?*
*None: A touching episode...won't say more than it's a summer vacation trip and that Sakura meets family and friends, while innocently breaking family grudges (on her mom's side- against her dad).*...",1012694400,4,1117,4.675126903553299
