8593100,3,B00DH6RHCS,"Chiaki Kuriyama (Go Go Yubari from Quentin Taratino's Kill Bill) travels to Buenos Aires to take in the city and dance lessons in how to perform the tango. These lessons culminate in a lavish party where she performs with her dance partner/tutor.  As a Japan only release the text and narration are in Japanese. Unfortunately, there are no English subtitles. I subtracted a star for this. You'll also need a multi region dvd player to play it.
In one sense, subtitles aren't really necessary. It's pretty easy to follow. Think of it as Chiaki Kuriyama: Parts Unknown. There's even food! But it becomes an impediment if you're interested in Chiaki's narration or in wanting to follow the conversations she has with the natives in their language (through an interpreter.) So unless you can speak and read Japanese you're out of luck. There is only one sequence where English is spoken briefly between her tutors. (A tantalizing bit about dancing with no clothes.)
As a result fans will have to settle for a strictly visual experience. The picture quality, thankfully, is pretty good. It's enough to capture Chiaki's stunning beauty as well as Buenos Aires' cultural richness. But a good portion of the feature is stuck inside dance studios which Chiaki's fans may like as there are a number of close ups of her.
The whole documentary is nearly 84 minutes long. Extras include a large number of dance lessons and a collage of Chiaki and her partner dancing to local music. The menu text is in Japanese only but it's also pretty easy to figure out.
As you may have guessed, I'm a fan of Chiaki Kuriyama. Others won't be interested. The dvd was a little expensive so unless you have some extra cash laying around and you're a completist you probably shouldn't bother.",1479772800,,1762,4.796052631578948
