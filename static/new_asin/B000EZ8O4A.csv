8115927,2,B000EZ8O4A,it's not a full length animation of the story. it's only 15 min. long and I was very disappointed,1497916800,,97,4.157894736842105
8115928,2,B000EZ8O4A,"This Video was disappointing. First of all the audio was not very good. The kids had a difficult time hearing all of the dialogue. Secondly, it was not easily understood by the age group I was focusing; ages 6-9. There was a lot of background I had to give before we could begin to watch the video.

I think the segment on the technique was valuable to anyone who may be interested in creating this type of video in the future. Other than that it was disappointing.",1377561600,,465,4.344827586206897
8115929,3,B000EZ8O4A,We will use this as opening for our Vacation Bible School this year.  The animation is simple but the info is good.,1212537600,,115,4.2272727272727275
