8670268,4,B00M4DUSIA,"Mitch (Doug Allen ) was once part of a gang called the Guvnors on the SE side. A young group of Hooligans form and bump heads with the old gang. Mitch had abandoned the gang 20 years ago and became a cop. Now with a battle going on, Mitch must be in the middle of it.

This is another young vs. old gang film. This one was okay, if you like that type of stuff. I thought there was too much drama and the twist which was to create the bittersweet ending, did nothing to move me. I preferred ""We Still Kill the Old Way"" better.
