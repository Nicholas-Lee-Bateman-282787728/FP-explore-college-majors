8352011,5,B00265TXDM,"This is a great miniseries about the ""maestrina"" Chiquinha Gonzaga. She is the most important woman composer in Brazilian history and one of the most (male or female) overall. She was the first woman to conduct in Brazil. The mini series is very well done and based on research, although there is poetic license and some of it is romanticized. The soundtrack is amazing--includes original music written by Chiquinha herself and also pieces written for the series. The main character is played by a mother and daughter to best showcase her when she is young and later on in life. Many well known Brazilian actors appear in the series and the costumes and sets are period. This DVD set has no English subtitles so you need to understand Portuguese to watch it and understand it. However, Rede Globo ([...]) does have the trailer and 1st episode site dubbed in English. It is under ""miniseries"".",1327276800,,892,4.798701298701299
