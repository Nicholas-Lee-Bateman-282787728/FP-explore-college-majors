8577417,5,B00C5H2TJG,"I'm really fond of this series, especially the cast.  There are lots of relatable stories: bigger guys struggling with body image, couples struggling with boundaries, younger men who don't know where they belong in the community. It's funny, it's serious when it needs to be, and it's got  lots of heart.  Lots of familiar faces pop up as cameos.  Having never been to the event in person, it's fun experiencing Bear Week in Provincetown vicariously through the second movie.",1437782400,,475,4.974683544303797
