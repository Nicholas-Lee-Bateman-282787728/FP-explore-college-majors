833639,5,6304290888,"This is probably Disney's most unique choice for one of their musical animated motion pictures. And the result was something beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly touching. I wish people wouldn't give a  horrible review of this film just because it didn't stick with the book  plot or because it's ""not kid-friendly"". My brother first saw  this movie when he was five or six, and he had no problem with it. And  while Disney's ending is much different than Victor Hugo's (I'm reading the  book, and I must say I _prefer_ Disney's ending), the truths in the book  remain in the film. What makes a monster and what makes a man?  This is  something everyone, child, teen,  or adult, should learn. I also like when  Quasimodo says to Frollo, ""All my life you've told me the world is a  dark, cruel place. But now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about  it is people like _you_!"" The world has evil in it, but it also has so  much good, and that's what this story is about. I love that. The music is  beautiful, the characters wonderful. My brother likes the gargoyles, but my  favorite was Clopin, the self-proclaimed gypsy king. If you see this movie  for no other reason, see it to hear this guy sing. What a voice!  Clopin is  a great character because he knows more than he says, he has all these  secrets but won't tell. He's the one that poses the ""riddle"" in  the beginning of the film: Who is the monster and who is the man?  It's a  great introduction. He steals the show in every scene he's in.  I imagine  Disney must get tired of cutesy-mouse/bear/princess flims and decided to  take a chance with something just a little bit darker, a little bit lighter  (in more ways than one), and a little bit deeper. Give ""The Hunchback  Of Notre Dame"" a chance. You may be surprised. To the bells of Notre  Dame!",956188800,2,1820,4.449848024316109

Everything about this  film is great from the animation to the music to the characters. The is  truly Disneys best work. Although Mulan was good ,it doesn't touch this.  This is Disney last truly great film. Hopefully there up coming movie  Dinosaur will bring this kinda of style back.

This motion picture fits into the formula of animated musicals of the time. Just as I suspected, the formula results in a seriously uneven tone. Thats what really takes this movie down a notch. It can be seen in the multiple cutesy or goofy side-characters, particularly the wannabe Three Stooges, and the ample slapstick. The story in general, however, touches on some very deep emotions and serious subject matter. Frollo is a truly menacing villain and makes for a walking cautionary tale of religious fanaticism, arrogance, and hatred. I could go on a rant on medieval religious conservatism and the contemporary Christian Right, but I promised my followers on Tumblr that I'd minimize such talk.

For the most part, the songs are somewhat forgettable and banal, however flashy the scenes are, even if Topsy Truvy has a very catchy tune. There are a couple of really great songs, though, namely the heart-rending God Help the Outcasts and the infamous Hellfire. There is splendidly beautiful animation, drawing, painting, and CGI all around. The voice-acting is predictably first-rate.

834162,3,6304290888,"THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME [1996] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Disneys 34th Animated Classic!

Inspired by Victor Hugo's classic novel, Disney brings the heroic adventures of Quasimodo, the gentle and lonely bell ringer of Notre Dame, to spectacular life.

The most unlikely of heroes, Quasi fights to save the people and the city he loved and, in turn, helps us to see people for who they are, rather than how they appear.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Hunchback of Notre Dame followed Walt Disney's winning formula closely. Alan Menken, the composer of all of the era's hits save for Lion King, was back and reunited with Pocahontas lyricist and fellow stage veteran Stephen Schwartz. Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, the young directing team that had success on Beauty and the Beast, returned to the helm with Don Hahn again serving as producer.

Perhaps the biggest variation lay in the story. Fairy tales had served Disney well. The Shakespearean animal story of The Lion King had done even better. Simplified American history as a backdrop to intercultural romance? Not so much. A 19th century adult novel by French author Victor Hugo was not an obvious choice, especially with its mature and potentially frightening content. However, this was not Victor Hugo's Hunchback; it was in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame we see a character who is the outcast would have certain adorability to his deformity. His heroism would be the traditional kind, his atypical existence would be softened down with comic sidekicks and a scene-stealing goat, and there would be lots of singing.

As gypsy jester Clopin explains in the lively opening number ""The Bells of Notre Dame"", a deformed baby is semi-adopted and named Quasimodo by minister of Justice Judge Claude Frollo. Frollo keeps Quasimodo in the bell tower above Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral. Quasimodo's only friends up there are Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, the stone gargoyles who are only alive in his company (and maybe in his mind). Even now in adulthood, the kind, lonesome Quasimodo is forbidden from leaving the bell tower by Frollo, who isn't much of a surrogate father or a man.

Frollo and his soldiers take drastic measures to rid their city of anyone they deem undesirable. That includes the sympathetic gypsy dancer Esmeralda, who claims sanctuary inside Notre Dame, but not before making an impression on both Quasimodo and Frollo's newly appointed captain of the guard, Phoebus. Despite some initial distrust, Quasimodo, Esmeralda, and Frollo all seem to have similar interests and help one another elude Frollo's unscrupulous guard.

It's not just its timing as part of Disney's descent that puts Hunchback on a plane beneath the likes of The Lion King, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. The story and characters, those fundamental elements, do not rank among Disney's finest. It's all engaging enough and looks very nice, with Disney animators uncovering much art and beauty in yesteryear Parisian architecture and religious imagery. The music, however, does not have that instantly unforgettable quality of the aforementioned foursome or even parts of Pocahontas. Disney had been dominating the Original Song category for years at the Academy Awards, often claiming multiple nominations and a win, but Hunchback was shut out, receiving only a nod for Original Score on one of those years where that was split into Dramatic and Musical or Comedy categories.

In the grand scheme of things, Hunchback's shortcomings are minor, but enough to earn the film ""good, not great"" classification. It's not a matter of the formula growing stale or overly familiar; it's just an imperfect application, Hugo's novel not being an ideal fit for a crowd-pleasing Disney outing. There's also a pretty striking disconnect between the easy-going material (Quasimodo and the comic relief gargoyles) with the more dramatic turns involving Frollo's guilt and passion.

The Lion King easily ran as wide an emotional gamut, from death and despair to bug-eating and warthog flatulence. Somehow, though, Lion King pulls it off perfectly, perhaps because of the distance between us and these African animals we know from idyllic zoo encounters. Hunchback centres on the human race and the sting of its cruel, harsh, judgmental side lands more than routine acts of compassion and selflessness.

Still, there is something distinctly magical about Disney's 1990s musicals that I think can only partly be credited to the form's impact on so many childhoods of those now in their mid-thirties and under. Part of it may be the confluence of pure, noble art forms: animation, music, cinema, theatre, and, in this film's case, literature. Even an effort a couple of steps beneath the best is supremely watchable, investable, and moving. If you've studied, frequented, and ruminated upon the Disney canon as often as I have, you're certain to find charming qualities to all of the different eras' output. Many feel an obligation to consider Walt's first forays into feature animation remaining the medium's apex and to an extent, I agree. But if you forced me to watch any Disney animated classic at any given time, I think I would probably be drawn to those modern renaissance musicals more often than not. Judging from the amount of passion they inspire online, I don't think I'd be alone in that inclination.

Blu-ray Video Quality  For all the beauty and stunning animation on display, The Hunchback of Notre Dame 1080p encoded video transfer has a few issues worth noting. Banding and artefacts appear from time to time (although rarely to any debilitating degree, minus the skies behind Frollo during Phoebus' near-execution), aliasing graces a handful of shots and darker scenes are at odds with the presentation's contrast levelling. Still, the good far outweighs the bad, making any mishap in the image an easily overlooked deformity. Colours are warm and vibrant, with bold primaries, rich purples and golds and deep blacks. Detail is excellent too. The animators' line art is crisp and clean on the whole, the brushstrokes and textures of the hand-painted backgrounds are wonderfully resolved, and the CGI elements fare well, even under high definition scrutiny. Moreover, significant macro blocking, crush, noise and other anomalies are either kept to a bare minimum or nowhere to be found, and most scenes come within a hair's breadth of perfection. The studio's technical encode isn't as proficient as other Disney Animation Blu-ray presentations, but its close enough to earn respectable marks.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Hunchback of Notre Dame bellows from its bell tower with a strong, stalwart 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track. The output resonates with power and presence, infusing weight and gravitas into both the dramatic and musical narrative that develop. The rear speakers, meanwhile, help bring the Parisian streets, Gypsy hideaways and vast Notre Dame Cathedral sound as busy, bustling or as sacred as each locale should. Directional effects are free to roam and pans are disarmingly smooth, while dynamics bring nuance to the film's already intricate sound design. And dialogue is crystal clear, perfectly grounded and carefully prioritized within the mix... which is unfortunately something I can't quite say about the song lyrics. Though always intelligible and typically balanced within each song, there are occasions where lyrics are overwhelmed by soaring orchestration. It doesn't ever emerge as a worrisome issue, but audiophiles will notice it all the same. That said The Hunchback of Notre Dame audio pairs neatly with its video presentation to produce a stirring spectacle. It isn't ideal, but it isn't without grand merit either.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

The Making of The Hunchback of Notre Dame [SD] [28:00] Jason Alexander hosts this corny but nevertheless informative DVD-era trip behind the scenes of Disney's 34th animated feature, from its place in the Disney canon to creating the characters, blending talent, technology, the music and more.

""A Guy Like You"" Multi-Language Reel [SD] [3:00] ""A Guy Like You"" sung in various languages.

Finally, regardless of the not so perfect Disney animation, that we have come to expect from the Walt Disney Factory franchise, maybe they were having an off day when they produced this animation? This release represents another huge missed opportunity for Disney to provide extras included on the original film's loaded 1997 Deluxe NTSC LaserDisc set. That three double-sided disc platter included three deleted songs with commentary by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, an early presentation reel, story reels, trailers, and extensive art galleries. It really doesn't make sense that Disney hasn't bothered to include this material to add some easy value to this Blu-ray disc as an upgrade over the DVD release that is widely available for less than half the price of this combo pack. Those who consider The Hunchback of Notre Dame to be one of Disney's underrated gems may be disappointed that the film doesn't get a more elaborate Blu-ray edition including the numerous extras that haven't been added to this Blu-ray disc, other than what is on my copy, but there was little chance that the studio was going to treat it to anything other than this particular Blu-ray Collection. Though offering nothing new in the bonus features department is a crying shame, the set doesn't lose anything from the DVD (putting most on the Blu-ray as well) and most importantly, delivers a breathtakingly beautiful presentation of the original film. Still despite it not being up the top quality standard we always expect from the Disney Animation Studio, because sadly the animation looks very cheaply made and maybe the crew were having an off day when it was produced and also they could not see the wood for the trees so to speak? Still despite this, I am still pleased to add this to my Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection and will now and again dip into this Blu-ray from time to time. One lucky escape for me is purchasing The Hunchback of Notre Dame II, especially as a 2 Blu-ray package, as it looks even more ghastly than the original Disney Blu-ray. Sadly I can only give The Hunchback of Notre Dame a slightly luke warm Recommend!

834261,5,6304290888,"Note: I saw this film via XFinity On Demand.

I saw this movie in the cinema when it came out, but I didn't remember much of it. However, I saw it again in its entireity for the first time in years today, and it is a well-done version of Victor Hugho's immortal classic Notre Dame De Paris. Of course, being a Disney movie, much of the novel's themes are toned down for younger audiences, but several key bits from the novel remain intact for the movie-SPOILERS AHEAD!!!-including Frollo's lust for Esmeralda and Quasimodo's rescue of Esmeralda from burning at the stake & the subsequent siege of Notre Dame. These key elements were handled tastefully, and should promote healthy discussion after the film. SPOILERS OVER!!! Walt Disney Pictures did a magnificent job with this motion picture.

Too intense for those under 10.

834267,4,6304290888,"I love this movie, but I was kind of surprised by the dark sexuality in it.  I'm not just speaking of esmeralda pole dancing on a soldier's spear and doing splits while winking at the audience when she does her sexy dancing performance in the square.  The main bad guy has a whole song about his hard-on for esmeralda- and though the song itself chooses it's words well enough to avoid problems, they still show him sniffing and rubbing up against Esmeralda's scarf while he's singing the lyrics ""....this fire in my skin, this burning desire is turning me to sin.""  Did they really have to show him rubbing up against and sniffing her scarf at that point to get the point across?  It's a fantastic song, but I think the point would've been more than clear enough without that extra animation.  Kid's won't understand that he's singing about his boner of coarse, but they might get confused and ask their mom or dad as to what Frollo means.  I've seen a lot of disney films and this one almost crosses the line.  I feel that Esmeralda could've been just as 'sexy' in her dancing without the splits and pole dancing and the bad guy's desire for her would've come across just as well without him rubbing up against her scarf and sniffing her.  I do feel however that out of all the disney films that are being adapted to the stage on Broadway, this one would translate very well onto the stage and would probably be the best stage adaptation of them all; especially since theater audiences tend to be older anyway.  Anyhow it's a great movie as far as I'm concerned, but I wouldn't risk gifting this movie to young children without first getting their parent's permission.",1393200000,3,1670,4.558528428093646

I was actually excited to see it because Disney movies are usually always great. The script was mediocre and the music wasn't memorable. Disney movies can be enjoyed by adults and sometimes, there are things that you won't understand until you watch them as an adult, but this one seemed like there wasn't much thought put into the script.

834526,5,6304290888,"I could go on and on. Perhaps I'm not in the mood, or maybe this is such a masterpiece that dissecting its story and storytelling magic is simply uncalled for. This is a story about lust, betrayal, jealousy, madness, murder and genocide. But don't worry you and the kids will leave the movie humming some of the finest theater music ever written.

Is this a fine interpretation of Victor Hugo's immortal classic? To quote Bugs Bunny, ""HMMMM... could be"". The story is pure Victor Hugo. The story-telling is pure Disney.

Any way to look at it, it is brilliant film-making and ground-breaking movie magic. Grumpy adults might well see lecherous sociopaths holding court in an abyss of human suffering. The kids (and believe me, there is still a kid inside you) will see Good Guys, Bad Guys, the Hero and the Villain. Well, TWO heroes, but who's counting?

They didn't cast Charles Laughton this time and Quasimodo (his friends call him Quasi) is voiced by Tom Hulse as a brilliantly imaginative, un-nurotic soul with a heart of gold. He's adorable.

Esmerelda is a Turquoise-eyed California Cheerleader, one part ""babe-a-licious"", one part ""Freedom Now!"" Hippie and 100% the kind of girl your hungarian mother always wanted you to marry.

I am just saying that when my collection of VHS tapes became old and the analog magnetic media was faltering due to playback, I wanted to get digital of my old movies. But new Disney movies are about $20 even when used.

When Disney movies first came out you could spend up to $100 to get a video that went back in the Disney vault.

Well, same thing is happening with DVD, while we wait for the videos to come out on Blu-ray.

So my solution is to seek out the older videos on the stable LaserDisc format, they are digital and usually disney videos are not subject as much to Laser Rot that damaged discs (there are resources to check if the LD was subject to laser rot)

So I get the classics in digital about 425 lines of resolution as opposed to VHS which is about 220 lines.  Not as good as DVD or Blu-ray but great for watching my favorite Disney Video's again, without spending tons of money.",1344643200,,930,4.2259887005649714

834772,5,6304290888,"It's hard to imagine two more different interpretations of the same source material.

""The Hunchback,"" made for television, isn't entirely true to the novel by Victor Hugo, but it's a poignant, passionate interpretation that boasts a trio of incredible performances. ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" made to sell lunchboxes and action figures, dismisses the novel entirely, sacrificing the power of the story for a package of cute, cuddly and happy.

The story deals with the misshapen bellringer of a 15th-century Parisian cathedral, a beautiful gypsy dancer and the fallen church leader who desires her. Often depicted as a horror, it is truly a tragedy of magnificent proportions.

Mandy Patinkin is the focal point of ""The Hunchback."" The handsome actor and singer is entirely hidden behind his grotesque makeup, but the heartbreaking level of emotion Patinkin pours through his mask and putty is astonishing to see.

Emotions dance to the beat of Patinkin's drum as we share his sheer joy at being crowned King of the Fools during a city celebration; the acclaim of the crowd is in part mocking, but that doesn't stop Quasimodo from wringing pure delight from a moment's brief acceptance. Then try to keep a dry eye as the hunchback is whipped for a crime he didn't commit; there is shock and betrayal more than pain here, and a desperate cry for water ... but it's his genuine smile when he sees his master, followed by utter misery when his master turns away, that really twists the heartstrings.

Don't expect even a hint of Patinkin's magical voice in this movie. It is buried deep beneath the tortured croak of the hunchback. His makeup, which entirely transforms the actor's head and body, is excellent.

Richard Harris supplies brooding presence as Dom Frollo, the conflicted archdeacon whose faith is severely tested -- and fails. Not evil, he is not as good as he once believed, and his argument for the banning of printed books is just plain scary. Harris's Frollo takes no joy from life, and by movie's end you'll find yourself pitying, not hating, this misguided villain.

Salma Hayek is both sultry and compassionate as Esmeralda, the dancing gypsy who inflames just about every male she meets. The object of Frollo's dark lust, she is also loved by Quasimodo, to whom she was kind, and activist/orator Gringoire (Edward Atterton). (The subplot between Esmeralda and Phoebus, captain of the guard, is dropped for brevity in this version.)

While the conclusion is somewhat lighter than Hugo's, it remains plenty dark. Hunchback is an emotional rollercoaster, and it's a shame Patinkin didn't receive the kudos for this effort that he deserved. This should be a classic, and I hope the powers that be release it soon on DVD.

Now, the cartoon. First, let me say that I'm typically a fan of Disney animation (to my wife's eternal chagrin and my children's delight), but I still cast a fairly critical eye of the cartoon mogul's interpretation of classic material. While I don't mind a certain degree of revisionism (and I even liked the happy-ending retelling of ""The Little Mermaid""), this takes it just a bit -- OK, a lot -- too far.

Sure, Quasimodo is still deformed, but now he's cute, too. His tortured voice has been replaced by the dulcet tones of actor Tom Hulce (Amadeus). Disney's Quasimodo is an acrobat of Olympics-caliber skill, with strength that exceeds any conventional weightlifter. And, far from being a lonely, isolated creature at the top of the belltower, he now has a close circle of friends; they may be stone gargoyles (silly and slapsticky, voiced by Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough and Mary Wickes), but that doesn't stop them from being chatty and supportive, and even from helping Quasi repel the king's men who seek to recapture Esmeralda.

Esmeralda, voiced by Demi Moore, is now a high-spirited trickster and a poster girl for feminism in medieval France. (My wife takes particular exception to her sensual pole dance at the Festival of Fools; this is, after all, a kids' flick.)

Frollo is now a civic judge with armies at his disposal; perhaps Disney balked at making a man of the church the film's villain. And, far from tormented and torn between right and wrong, this Frollo (Tony Jay) is outright evil, malicious and wearing a constant sneer. Phoebus, the captain of the guard with a conscience and the hots for Esmeralda, rounds out the cast; expertly voiced by Kevin Klein, his dry wit is the source for most of the movie's genuine laughs.

Visually, the movie boasts some stunning vistas. The architecture of Paris, particularly the cathedral itself, is dramatic, rich and highly detailed -- although the awesome spectacle of molten lead pouring from the cathedral like Niagara Falls becomes laughable when you realize this vast quantity of hot death comes from a single boiling pot.

The music, seeking to equal the heights of a Broadway or London stage production, reaches too high. There's nothing memorable here, a far cry from earlier Disney soundtracks.

And, while there is certainly an obvious message of acceptance for young viewers, the movie works too hard to come up with a happy ending that must have left the late Victor Hugo writhing in his grave.

At the final tally, Disney's version is OK, so far as animated, watered-down classics set to music go, but for a stirring look at the wretched face and gentle soul of the hunchback, Mandy Patinkin has it down pat.

834774,5,6304290888,"This is one of my all-time fav. Disney movies for a million reasons, but here are a few that I'll point out to ya...
 First the cast is excellent! Demi Moore has the sexy, yet affectionate and caring voice for Esmerelda. Kevin Kline adds a strong and sensitive tone to Phoebus. And Jason Alexander is perfect for the wise-cracking Hugo. Not to mention Tom Hulce as Quasimodo. He's got a beautiful singing voice, also humbling, innocent as well as hopeful character voice.
 Second I watched this movie as a child and it has every element of they typical Disney movie.  Catchy songs, loveable characters, color and magic and a moral to it all. I would sit and watch it over and over again, I loved it and so did other kids my age.
 Now that I watch it at age 16, totally different elements in the movie interest me. The time period, for one, is amazing. 1480 something is about the time, and the arcitecture, Romanequse and Gothic styles combined for beautiful Cathedrals in Paris. The festivals, typical in Europe in the late Middle ages, give insight on life back then. Aside from the cultural aspects, are the characters. Quasimodo, the deformed bellringer, is held high in the tower, away from society. On his first journey down from the tower, he befriends and later falls in love with the beautiful Esmerelda. Esmerelda soon meets Pheobus, the captin of the guards assigned to kill her, and they fall in love. All the while, Frollo, the evil gaurdian of Quasi, becomes obsessed with Esmerelda's entrancing ways. He decides that if he can't have her, no one can. He prays to God to have mercy on him for his obession, and in the end can't control it. So the troublesome ""love circle"" all the characters are caught up in adds an emotional twist, esp. when Quasi doesn't get the girl in the end.
 The music is great in the film also. Not as many catchy beats, which is unusual in a Disney film, but rather Catholic hymms of forgiveness. The motif of these songs and lyrics in latin almost give an eerie feel to the film. Quasi's songs of love and life outside Notre Dame's walls almost left me in tears. Esmerelda's hymm of prayer to God shows her selflessness and is an uplifting scene in the film. Finally, Frolo's dark ""Hellfire"" is totally a radical move for Disney. A threat on the gypsy's life, as well as the visual elements of fire, demonds and hell is enough to leave you with chills.",1063411200,,2394,4.558139534883721

834866,5,6304290888,"I'll agree with one of my fellow reviewers in saying that this is one of Disney's darker and deeper films.  Not as dark as the actual story goes, as Disney likes to fluff everything up for younger viewers, but dark for a Disney film.
The portray of Frollo is most likely what brings the moodier feel to the movie.  I can say, with much ease, that Disney did his sinister character justice.  He is definately the only Disney character that gives off the vibe of pure [badness].
On the lighter side of things, there are many points in the film that make it an easy going, fun piece of work.  The gypsy king Clopin provides brilliant vocal works and acts as the storie's narrarator.
Quasimodo is fluffier than that in Hugo's book, but it works for his character.  The fact that he sings in the film also helps.
The portrail of Esmerelda is perfect.  She had the perfect image and was brave.
The image of Pheobus is done in the most amusing way that I've ever seen.  His stiff-as-a-board character is great because of his raw humor.
The only thing I didn't enjoy about the movie was the fact that those talking gargoyles were everywhere.  They just got on my nerves.

834869,5,6304290888,"Disney did some pretty good ones like 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'the Little Mermaid', but after that he went sort of downhill with 'Pocahontas' and 'Aladdin'.  I think that his best after that was the 'Hunchback of Notre Dame.'  With it's superb animation of the Cathedral and its interior and it's great adaptation of the story by Hugo, it's a great movie.
 The first thing i should mention is the music and songs.  Elton John wrote the music and he did a great job!  From the strong 'Bells of Notre Dame', to the moving 'Out There' and even the passionate 'God help the Outcasts', the songs are high-score.  I thought 'Topsy-Turvy' and 'A Guy like You' were more or less out of place, but fit into the story.  You can't help but feel a shiver down your back as you watch Frollo sings his haunting 'Hellfire'.
 The characters and story is pretty good too.  They did a good portrayal of the poor, lonely bellringer Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) confined to his belltower for the rest of his days.  Demi Moore did a great job as the lovely gypsy Esmeralda who befriends him at a festival. Tony Jay's ominous voice makes a good portrayal of the demented judge Frollo, after Esmeralda and all gypsies for prejudical reasons.  Kevin Kline is Phoebus, the captain who falls in love with Es and becomes an outcast, along with the Gypsies and Quasimodo.  I have no idea who did the voices of the Gargoyles, who were there for a little humor to the story, but they weren't bad.  In the end, of course, good conquers over evil.
 I think the movie was more or less dark and little children wouldn't understand a lot of it, so I think it was ore adult or teen oriented.  Still, it was one of Disney's better efforts!",1001721600,3,1698,4.467532467532467

834871,3,6304290888,"Am I the only one that finds the moral of this lonely-misfit-goes-through-adventures-only-to find-true- happiness-at-the-end-in-spite-of-whatever-hideous-disfigurements-or-social-inadequacies-he-or-she-might-have story rather odd and unpleasant?  Okay, forget the idea that this is ""based"" on a Victor Hugo novel.  I could only watch it as a thing in and of itself, as it was otherwise intolerable.  But regardless, this is one in a long series of Disney movies with the same theme--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast (interesting in that BOTH leads were misfits), Aladin, Mulan and more recently Shrek, among others.  Disney even tried to cast Hercules in that light, although completely unconvincingly.  So Quasimodo is in distinguished company, and it's certainly a message worth saying repeatedly.  Kids need to be empowered to go their own way, to assert their individuality, and to practice compassion toward others.  And certainly the ""odd"" kids, whatever the cause of their difference, need hope and love.  Of course it is no suprise that many of those involved in the production of these films on many levels are somewhat divergent themselves.
But Hunchback seems to tell a rather different story.  While Belle and the Beast's love overcame Beast's curse and restored him (and his entourage) to his former magnificence, and the Little Mermaid lost her tail but gained a prince and a kingdom--alas, in spite of the good intentions there is certainly a subtext that it's okay to be different as long as you are beautiful and rich, which even Mulan doesn't escape--poor Quasimodo doesn't fare as well.  Not only Quasi, but Esmerelda also is an outcast, and according to the typical Disney logic they should end up together, redeemed by their love.  But apparently the audience can't stomach that--so Esmerelda, in spite of her affection for Quasimodo and his totally selfless dedication to her, ends up with the vapid but beautiful knight.  The hideous disfigured hunchback is deemed too awful to get the girl, in spite of the beautiful person that he has inside, and ends up with the consolation prize of spending the rest of his life in a low rent walk-up with a couple of real gargoyles.  What kind of a message is that to send to kids, especially those who might have some kind of physical abnormality themselves?  Most of the audience walked out thinking they had just seen a comedy, but no, it was a tragedy as deep as Hugo's.  At least the original Quasimodo didn't have to continue waking up every day realising he was too horrifying to ever have his true love.  Disney, what were you thinking?  How very uplifting.  Others have said that this is not a movie for children, but if not, who is the target audience?
The music is the saving grace, and several of the songs are absolutely terrific, including the tear-jerking ""God Help the Outcasts"" and the dramatic ""Bells of Notre Dame"".  Superb orchestration deserves a mention, too.  But rather than purchase the film, buy the soundtrack instead and then take your kids to Shrek, whose take on these same themes is much more uplifting.

As is the acting.  For some reason I thought that it would be a joke--considering the actors.  But everyone involved did a great job.  Hunchback is one of Disney's better films and unfortunetly it was not as successful as it should have been because of the content.  It is a cartoon --excuse me --an animated feature for adults, and may not appeal to little ones. This movie is about societies outcasts and those who do not fit into the prescribed roles.  It also shows the corruption and hypocrisy of the ruling elite.
I have the sountrack for this movie and tears still come to my eyes when I hear the song ""God help the outcasts"" (which I used at my Baptism) it goes: ""God help my people they look to you still/God help the outcasts or nobody will.""

Having said that, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is a classic piece of Disney animation that is true to the spirit, if not the letter, of the book.  The film handles the themes of racism, hypocracy and friendship with style and grace.  The voice casting is supurb with Tom Hulce (Quasimodo), Demi Moore (Esmeralda), Tony Jay (Frollo) and Kevin Kline (Captain Pheobus) delivering moving performances.  Jay's solo ""Hellfire"" is an inspired work that never shies from Frollo's dark obsession for Esmeralda.  Indeed, this film is an excellent introduction to Hugo's classic, while entertaining in its own right.  Hopefully, the DVD version will come out soon.

834984,5,6304290888,"When I first heard Disney were making a feature film based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame, I was shocked they had decided to tackle such an adult and controversial story.  But any misgivings I held were soon quashed from just about the first second the film opened.
The film opens with a panoramic shot of Notre Dame cathedral rising above the clouds, from here the story focusses on the disfigured bellringer Quasimodo, imprisoned in the belltower by his surrogate father, Frollo as a punnishment for his disfuigurement.  The hunchback soon falls in love with a young gypsy named Esmeralda, a romance we all know is not going to happen.  At the same time, Frollo becomes obsessed by Esmerada at a time when he is trying to cleanse Paris of gypsies and theives.  But Esmerlada has already fallen in love with the soldier, Pheobus, Quasimodo accepts this but Frollo relentlessly demands Esmeralda chooses him or burns at the stake.  Qusimodo rescues her from certain doom in a jaw-dropping set-peice centred around the balconies of the cathedral, and concluding with Frollo plunging to his death in a fiery pit, after failling to murder both Quasimodo and Esmeralda.  Quasimodo escapes the confinement of the cathedral and is accepted by the people of Paris.
This is quite easily Disney's most mature and sophisticated production to date.  Every chacracter is developed to perfection, Frollo is by far the most complex and twistedly evil Disney villain ever, Esmeralda is the first postfeminist Disney heroine (not a squeaky voiced princess from Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid)  And Quasimodo shows that it's OK to be the hero of the tale and not be a handsome, young prince who always gets the girl.
The songs when compared to other Disney yardsticks (Under the Sea, Circle of Life etc) are not outstanding but they work perfectly within the scope of the movie itself.  The actual score however is a masterpeice, the signature bell notes make up much of the dramtic intensity.  The animation is more real and thourough than previous animated movies, hats off to the animators who succeed in developing Notre Dame into a playing chracter.  And I disagree with the opinion that the talking Gargoyles come over contirved and goofy, anyone who's read Vistor Hugo's novel knows it was he who first gave the idea that the stone statues were Quasimodo's only real friends and who he poured his heart out to every day.
With such an ironic love tale and such pure strentgh in charcter, Disney confronted the challenges set by the novel and produced perhaps there most rounded and complete adaptation yet.  The real misconception about this film is that people assume it was made for children, when in truth (like all Disney features) it was made for the child in all of us.

I cannot say enough about them.  The soundtrack as a stand alone is 98% perfect *except for A Guy Like You* and I urge you to go get it on CD if you liked the film.

If Disney re-releases Hunchback I will go see it another 10 times in a heartbeat!!*  The characterizations were great.  The only thing I would have changed would have been to tone down the gargoyles, but they had to have something for the kids.  In short, the only other Disney animated film to have this type of effect on me was Lion King.  Get Hunchback, watch it, enjoy it and listen to the music.  You won't regret it.

834989,5,6304290888,"5 stars and 1000 words aren't enough to tell you how great this movie is!  ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is truly Disney's greatest triumph.  It has everything: the most spetacular animation, the strongest characters,  the most complex story, and the best music. Okay, so it may not be  appropriate for little kids, big deal. When was the last time you heard a  Disney employee say they were making a movie for little kids, anyway? Think  about it.
Just the movie's animation is enough of a reason to give it  five stars. Almost everything, from the statues around the cathedral, to  the city errupting in flames, to a sunset seen from Notre Dame's roof, to  the church's interior, is absolutly astonishing. It invites you to just  jump into the screen and visit 15th century Paris, and the trip is a  stunning feast for the eyes. I can't believe it's all on paper and/or  computer screen.
Living in this world are some of Disney's strongest  characters (did I mention that already?). The audience can truly root for  the three heros. Quasimodo is Disney's best guy, plain and simple. His goal  starts out simple enough: he wants a day of freedom. However, it becomes  far more complex after he has fallen in love. It is then when he shows the  courage to give his all for another, and the strengh to sacrifice his  happiness for hers. Oh gosh, when he sings the heartbreaking ""Heaven's  Light"" about his love for Esmeralda, and the possobility that she  might love him back, you will be absolutly moved. Then when the song  is  repeated as he watches Esmeralda and Phoebus share a passionate kiss, you  may very well cry. As for Esmeralda, she is one of Disney's most intruiging  heroines. She never hesitates to stand up for what's right, and never  hesitates to help someone in need (to say nothing that she never hestitates  to kick soldiers.)However, her true personality is revealed in an  absolutely beautiful scene where she sings ""God Help The  Outcasts,"" a wonderful prayer of hope and selflessness. I still get  choked up whenever I hear that song. The only thing about Esmeralda that I  really don't understand is why she prefers Phoebus to Quasimodo (I don't  think anyone really wants to say ""Well he's got a straight back! So of  course she prefers him!"") As for Phoebus, he (thankfully) got the  expected Disney makeover from the wicked guy in the book to a likable  soldier with a heart and a conscience. I give the guy thumbs up just for  that, but there's more. He refuses an order to kill innocent people, almost  getting his head cut off in the process, but setting a positive example for  today's boys who might become tomorrow's soldiers (and I desperatly hope  tomorrow's soldiers will have better consciences than today's.)
I won't  repeat what other reviewers said about Frollo, but I will say that he is  Disney's most intruiging villian. Deep down, he knows what he's doing is  wrong, but he can't face it, so he struggles to convince himself that what  he's doing is right. Isn't that how most people will carry out wicked  deeds? Oh, and when Frollo sings ""Hellfire,"" about his burning  desire for Esmeralda, shivers go down your spine. No, really.
Alan  Menken outdid himself with the music for this film. From the spellbinding  opening song ""Bells of Notre Dame"" to the closing credits ballad  ""Someday,"" the songs are top-notch, and the score adds a layer of  depth to the movie (you'll see what I mean if you read what the Latin  lyrics mean in the booklet that comes with the soundtrack.) I still can't  believe the Oscar people picked ""That Thing You Do"" over  ""Someday"" for a Best Song nomination. For that matter, I can't  believe HUNCHBACK failed to get a Best Picture slot. ""Beauty and the  Beast"" was nominated, but not this! Sometimes I don't know what those  guys are thinking.

Here we are treated to such a sweeping tapestry of beautiful  graphic art so meticulous and breathtaking I actually feared it to be a  work of demons if the whole project was undertaken in just a year.

But - Quasimodo's great exhiliaration soon turns to horror when the wicked  Frollo furiously orders that the sexy Esmerelda be put to death and the  whole Gypsy population be destroyed altogether.

835083,4,6304290888,"I have to admit when I first watched this film I did not care for it. I was expecting the typical Disney formula- lots of singing animals and whatnot. What I found was an adult film, adult themes and concepts and a  ""heroine"" drawn in a more appealing to adults manner. HOWEVER, I  decided to give it another try and I watched it a few times. The songs are  not Aladdin-like for their memorable qualities but their lyrics are intense  and set to lovely music. ""Out there"" and ""God Help the  Outcasts"" were the two best of the film. The animation is excellent  and the mood is set extremely well. I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I  will agree with some of the others who have said, this time there was not  enough done for the kids, it is hard to keep them focused during this movie  because even though we grow to love quasimodo he is not a humorous  character that kids can enjoy and he doesnt have his sidekicks with him for  the bulk of the movie. It is worth adding to your collection despite this  but you may want to watch it yourself instead of giving it to the little  ones.",962755200,,1085,4.259803921568627
835084,5,6304290888,"This isn't a movie for kids-it is dark, religious, violent, etc....Well, what's wrong with an animated picture for adults?  Ok, so it's got a few small problems, the gargoyles are nothing but annoying (with apologies to  the wonderful, late Mary Wickes) and Quasi warbling ""Out There""  like the Little Mermaid is something we all could have done without...BUT!  The rest of the music...Oh_my_God.  You will cry when Esmerelda sings  ""The Outcasts""  against the background of stained-glass at the  cathedral.  You will cry when Quasi sings ""Heaven's Light"" and  softly rings the bells, which segs seamlessly into Frollo's evil song,  making a nice counterbalance. THEN, to top everything off, we have the  beautiful latin chants in the background throughout the movie, and the  wonderful talent of Paul Kandel as Clopin (he is like the Master of  Ceremonies in Cabaret).  You will get shivers when you hear this man's  amazing voice as he sings ""The Bells Of Notre Dame"" at the  beginning and end of the movie. Menken and Schwartz have outdid themselves  on this one.  And if you think I have talked too much about the music  alone,  well let's just say the animation ain't too shabby either.  If you  are a sap for Broadway musicals, you must see this movie!",961977600,,1258,4.885714285714286
835085,4,6304290888,"It would not be hard to contemplate a more difficult story line for Disney to adapt on screen than Victor Hugo's ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", but that doesn't mean it was a walk in the park either.  Not  only is there the conundrum of how to make Quasimodo true to his character  and at the same time not so unsightly in appearance as to frighten off  youngsters, but how will Victor Hugo's dark commentary of 15th Century  Parisian life, capital punishment and religious bigotry be accommodated?  What of Claude Frollo's lascivious desires for Esmerelda and wanton acts  upon Quasimodo and gypsies?  And that ending...a bit of a downer don't you  think?  Well, believe it or not, Disney stays true to each of these facets  of the novel...with the exception of the tragic conclusion, of  course.
Talking gargoyles aside, the film really does not do enough to  accommodate young viewers (and perhaps it was a mistake to market this as a  kid's movie, but you got to sell those Burger King toys somehow!).  The  villain (Frollo) is among the most sinister characters ever portrayed in a  Disney movie, and unlike Jafar (""Alladin"") or Hades  (""Hercules""), there is nothing humorous about him.  On the other  hand, the animators went a little overboard with Quasimodo, who kinda looks  like a red-headed Chris Farley.  And Phoebus has the personality of Al  Gore...if he were any more wooden you'd have to check him for termites.  Also, some very interesting characters from the book are regrettably  absent.  Where's Pierre Gringoire, Jehan Frollo, and Sister Gudule?  Still,  the animation is breathtaking, and the finale is nearly flawless...preferred  to original version if you're a sentimental fan of happy endings.
The  movie contains a few hilarious subliminal references, as when Quasimodo  (Tom Hulce) is dressed up briefly as Amadeus.  The music is incredible and  supports the film's most compelling scenes:  Esmerelda singing ""God  Help The Outcasts"" while taking sanctuary in the cathedral, the  counterpoint of Quasimodo's ""Heaven's Light"" to Frollo's  ""Hell Fire,"" and the heart-pumping score behind the finale.  Probably would have been given a PG rating if not for Eisner's influence  over MPAA.",960940800,42,2211,5.103932584269663
835086,5,6304290888,"Frollo, as voiced by Tony Jay, is probably Disney's most frightening villain.  He possesses no magic powers or superhuman strength.  However, he is armed with his own personal demons of lust, contempt, and hatred of  others, while hiding under the guise of the church, that he is revealed to  be more threatening than any ""baddie"" produced by the studio.  Listen to the lyrics and study the animation during Frollo's solo and you  will find a most adult presentation.
Much more than just a reworking of  the classic story, ""Hunchback"" is a cautionary tale about the  pitfalls of hypocrisy.
This one is DEEP!",960768000,2,607,4.882352941176471
835087,4,6304290888,"Some people must have short memories. Everybody is saying how great Tarzan is, and I've taken quite a bit of heat for trashing that movie. Yet if they want to find a similar movie that's much better, all they have to do is  look a few years back, and they'll see this movie, The Hunchback of Notre  Dame. Nevermind that it's not at all like the book, this movie has all of  Tarzan's strengths and very few of its weaknesses. Tarzan has a poor story,  poor characters, and a poor villain. The Hunchback of Notre Dame has a  strong story, great characters, and a fantastic villain. Both are dark and  inappropriate for kids. Both have fantastic animation and great action.  Yet, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is clearly the superior of the two. That's  pretty much all that needs to be said.

835088,5,6304290888,"Basic moral of the movie, in the words of one of the main character: God help the Outcasts, for no one else seems to care.
If you love musicals and operettas, you'll love Hunchback. Disney has really outdone itself on  this one. The music is the most powerful you've heard in a long time from  our friends over there in the Disney studios and the animation is flawless.  Both do much justice to the plot, though altered, but we must remember that  this *is* a Disney movie.
Oh, did I forget to mention? This movie is  dark. And when I mean dark, I mean it's *not* for kids. Yes folks, Disney  has managed to produce a movie that is not suitable for children at all.  But teens and adults will love it.
The character that absolutely stole  the show was, without a shadow of a doubt, the evil Judge Claud Frollo,  voiced by Ton Jay. His scenes left me in awe, as Disney presented his  internal battle between preserving the thin line between pureness and sin  superbly, thanks to amazingly symbolic animation and music.
Bottom line?  Better than that Pocahontas swill, almost as good as Lion King and  curiously similar to Beauty and the Beast. Disney will never be able to top  themselves after this one.",958176000,2,1203,4.5092592592592595
835089,5,6304290888,"While entertaining for children, this movie has a tremendous amount of nuances intended for adults. The dark storyline about Frollo's obsession and his dealings with the Esmerelda as well as the old Captain of the Guard  can only be appreciated by a mature viewer.  The music in Hunchback is the  most ""Broadway quality"" work they have done yet, or since.  The  singing talent is unmatched.  The story is extremely compelling and has  the viewer on the edge of their seat from the time that Esmerelda first  escapes.  Those that have written that the story strays too far from the  book must be of the opinion that plot, and not theme or characterization,  is the most important part of a novel.  This story sticks pretty close to  Hugo's message of immoral persecution of good, but powerless people by  evil, powerful people.  In my opinion, it's Disney's best.",957571200,4,862,4.808219178082192

Kind of ironic for a story that tries to teach you to look beyond someones outside appearance/labels.  Some of the stereotypes about ""Gypsies"" are pretty offensive in my opinion.  You're not going to get to know much about the real Romani people that would have been in France at the time.  Disney has a love of exploring world cultures but often gets stuck on stereotypes and usually damaging ones about the cultures it explores in movies.  Despite the somewhat offensive stereotypes I still enjoyed the movie.  Brings back memories of watching it as a kid.
