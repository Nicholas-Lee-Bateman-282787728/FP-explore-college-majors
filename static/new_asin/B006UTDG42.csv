5020222,4,B006UTDG42,I bought this after seeing a clip on YouTube and it is inspiring. I showed portions of it to my students and they couldn't believe that some people their age felt so passionate about poetry. They really were inspired as was I. It's like a real life version of Freedom Writers - not as much drama.,1342310400,,296,4.303571428571429
5020223,5,B006UTDG42,"I read some online reviews about this documentary, and thought, what the heck. I'll watch it.

Wow. That is all I can say.

Watching these kids, on the cusp of adulthood and the quality and depth of their words just hits you so hard. Some of the things they write about, some of their experiences are so beyond what I deal with day to day, yet their words have the ability to bring me right there, into that moment.

I watched this with my teenage daughter, and we were both just blown away. I would highly recommend this!",1335830400,,522,4.3061224489795915
5020224,5,B006UTDG42,"This is an excellent, engaging documentary. I saw it at a screening in Chicago and was so impressed with these young adults. I have to believe that the trajectory of many of their lives was changed by their involvement in slam poetry.",1333929600,,234,4.595238095238095
5020225,5,B006UTDG42,"It never opened in more than four theaters, and it didn't receive a whole lot of press, so there's a good chance you never heard of this engrossing documentary. Louder Than A Bomb depicts the journeys of four high school slam poetry teams in the Chicago area as they prepare for the largest youth slam in the world, profiling individual backstories and attempting to capture the creative processes that drive the students. While it's a bit of a niche subject, and while the overarching themes are somewhat familiar, the talent on display and the heartwarming stories portrayed succeed in lifting the spirits so effectively that the film is worth watching. If you're looking for an engaging and inspirational film peppered with charming personalities and stunningly delivered poetry, definitely give Louder Than A Bomb a chance.",1332288000,6,827,5.133333333333334

Ever since the first time i participated at LTAB (Louder than a Bomb) i was hooked and I now participate in the college slma. I recommend everyone to watch this film to understand many youth, who love poetry.",1330300800,4,493,4.67816091954023

5020229,5,B006UTDG42,"At once inspiring and tear jerking with it's poignancy, this documentary is profound.  It shows a mixture of inner city high school students as well as those from a privileged school on an even ground sharing their poetry.  If you think it is a lost art, watch this documentary and you will be amazed at the raw honesty these students share.  The respect they have for each other is amazing.  This shows that the arts need to be recognized for so many reasons during the school years.",1463961600,,484,4.528735632183908

5020254,4,B006UTDG42,"This film works as a documentary that many can watch and enjoy because it doesn't necessarily have an agenda other than to show the way that spoken word can bring people together in ways that they normally wouldn't be.  Obviously it works as advertisement for the yearly event of the same name, and by association, the Young Chicago Authors organization.  And obviously Chicago is a unique area in the United States, and not all areas of the country will be represented.  However, it's a celebration of how the underprivileged or strange students in the public school systems of the world can be championed and stand out in ways they otherwise never would have.

When you see some of the featured kids, it feels that they genuinely could have taken a much darker path if not for their outlet in slam poetry.  As cheesy as it sounds, you can tell that most of these kids have had rough lives (there are a few exceptions) and have probably been told that they will amount to nothing.  Even if slam poetry is not something most or any of them will go on to do professionally, it was a way for them to express themselves and find a confidence that they may not have found in other ways.  There is also an undercurrent of a struggle to do slam poetry and to stay educated and complex rather than turning to the shallow lifestyle and machismo of mainstream rap that often defines the culture of young African-American males.

I show this to my high school English classes because this is a film that features the spoken word in a way that is developed by and is understood by high school students.  It also highlights the type of young person that is normally not featured as a role model or example.  And when the film actually locks in and lets you experience the entirety of a poem without too much movement or music, it's very powerful and engaging.  If you could see the faces of the students in my class when they see the performances, you would know that this is not something they see every day.  As a teacher that is constantly trying to find ways to make class interesting and engaging, this film is definitely working in those areas.

That said, I wish there was a little more of the actual performances in this film.  You only get to see a few of them in a very natural way.  Many other times you only get little lines here or there out of context, and sometimes they play music during them, and while it works, it can also take away from the affect of the natural delivery of the poem.  Also, they highlight, for the most part, 4 students from different schools, taking us through their preparation leading to the event and gives us some background on them.  You really start to get invested in the story of these kids, and then the film ends up focusing mostly on the Steinmetz school and their performances.  While these performances were great - and the ""drama"" of them trying to win back-to-back championships is endearing - you end up feeling a little robbed by not seeing more of the other performances by the end.  This is somewhat due to the fact that Steinmetz also advanced a bit farther than others, but it feels a little unbalanced.  There is also some bits about a young man named Nate at the end, but it feels out of context and not as intense as Steinmetz performances and seeking to win another 1st place victory.

While I could go on more about those criticisms, they are not wholly damaging to this film.  It is an engaging film that would be great for Chicago natives, artists, and for teachers or students trying to tap into the power of the spoken word.  Despite some rough language at times (as if high school students haven't heard it before), the work ends up pretty redeeming at the end and is very effective.",1432080000,3,3741,4.493353028064993
5020255,5,B006UTDG42,"Inspiring!  This documentary is about identifiable teens in not-so-easy situations, coping with daily stresses, and finding their voices. A great way to teach young persons an alternative way to express themselves. I'd recommend this to any person working with teens, and also to those struggling to raise those teens in an often difficult world.",1431216000,,346,5.407407407407407

5020257,5,B006UTDG42,"I cannot speaking highly enough of this beautiful, powerful, compelling documentary.  You don't have to be a high school teacher like me to be inspired and uplifted by these students and teachers, but if you are, you will be so proud and grateful for your profession.",1426377600,,267,4.804347826086956

5020261,5,B006UTDG42,"I used this documentary to teach my 11th graders about the power of their own voices, and it was a hit! My students have actually been pushing to start a slam team next school year since we watched this in class. I teach in an urban high school filled with kids from all walks of life, and it's really difficult to find something that engages them. LtaB definitely did, and I highly recommend using this to expand student comprehension of modern poetry, slam, and the power behind their own voices.",1403913600,,498,4.544444444444444
5020262,5,B006UTDG42,It was amazing to see how talented these kids are and how they used poetry to express their thoughts emotions on everyday life. They are so passionate about what they do.,1400544000,,170,4.516129032258065
5020263,5,B006UTDG42,"Each year in my English classroom I see eyes roll and hear exasperated gasps from the students when I announce that we will study poetry.  Each year, I watch my students become fully engrossed in this film, leaning forward in their seats.  As the video ends, they are disappointed, yet they have a little fire in their eyes because they understand so much about what poetry is.  I will not lie and say they all become excited about studying and writing poetry, but at the very least, they become open to it.

No one has ever defined poetry in a way that I consider satisfactory, and as I continue my love affair with poetry, I realize that the impossibility of pinning down poetry in a definition may be part of what I love about it.  This video is an audio/visual definition of poetry.  It shows students that poetry is emotional - from the gut.  It guides them into understanding that poems by those they consider boring (Dickinson, Frost, Angelou, Dunbar - just look through any textbook) are just as visceral and make us look at the same old things in a different way.

Each poet highlighted is amazing.  You may find you have a favorite, but you will walk away admiring each of these young poets as gifted and honest.",1399248000,,1222,4.5181818181818185
5020264,5,B006UTDG42,"Excellent documentary that was moving, inspiring, and amazing.  I highly recommend this documentary for students in the 7th grade and above.  Especially beneficial for students facing tough personal and academic challenges as they may relate with some of the poets.  I have watched many of the poems a dozen or so times to each they move me in a different way.  Loved this movie!!",1396569600,,380,4.890625
5020265,5,B006UTDG42,"This is an awesome and powerful movie. It's feel good and inspirational. The pacing of this documentary will keep you glued to the screen. It's also a tear jerker at times, this film deserves more attention, and many of the poets featured in the film deserve more attention. See it!",1392768000,,282,4.66
5020266,5,B006UTDG42,"Straight-up fire! This helped ignite my mild obsession with poetry. I've started writing it last year, and one day I hope to be anywhere as good & clever as these guys. Its inspiring and fun. Rea;ly popular with my english classmates, many of whom don't reallly apply themselves in class.",1391299200,,288,4.78
5020267,5,B006UTDG42,"I love it so much I went to see the live performances. It was great to see how the students' lives came alive in their poems/spoken word. I saw this based on a recommendation, but I would use this if working a poetry unit (maybe 5th grade and up).",1384041600,,247,4.061224489795919
5020268,5,B006UTDG42,"My classes are viewing this documentary before we discuss poetry. Inspirational. Adam Gottliebe reciting his ""Poet, Breathe Now"" is worth the price of the dvd. Some language.",1376956800,,174,5.481481481481482
5020269,5,B006UTDG42,"My sophomores are starting a slam poetry unit and I wouldn't choose to start it any other way than with this documentary.

8504714,5,B006UTDG42,"Very inspirational video about high school students competing in a poetry slam contest. There is some swearing in it, not anything excessive, but I meticulously watched it before I played a section of it for my students so I could pause it and move past it. You can never be too careful. My students loved it and have been asking me to show the entire movie but theres no time with everything that has to be covered. It did get them excited for the poetry unit and presentations, which was what I was hoping for. Maybe theyll go on to write more, you never know.
