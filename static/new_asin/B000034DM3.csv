1261524,5,B000034DM3,"It doesn't matter if you play hockey on the ice, inline or on the street, this instructional DVD is fantastic if you want to learn how to shoot and score like the Hull Family.
The DVD starts out with cool NHL scoring highlights followed by detailed intruction on how to shoot & score goals when playing hockey.  This instructional DVD covers the best positions on the ice to score from, goalies weaknesses, where to shoot on the net and the secret weapon all goal scorers possess!  Viewers are instructed hand positions on the stick and puck positions in relation to the body for each and every shot.  Instruction includes weight transfer and follow through techniques that helped me with my shot in the first lesson.
All the shots in hockey are reviewed and broken down in slow motion segments so even begginers can catch on quickly!  This DVD will teach you the wrist shot, the backhand shot, the snap shot, the one time shot, the slapshot and dekes!  It covers everything!  With the shot demonstrations done by NHL Superstar Brett Hull and telestration and explainations by former Coach of The Year Bobby Hull Jr., you cannot help but see your shot improve quickly.  There is even insites by NHL Hall of Fame Member Bobby Hull Senior.
The DVD is very well organized and functions both on PC's and the television/DVD player set up.  All menues are clearly labeled and easy to locate and use.  To top it off, there is a drills segment that showed me exactly how to practice the skills I learned while watching the DVD.  There are even some funny out takes at the end of the video.  I can tell you that this is one of the best instrutional hockey items on the market because I have tried them all!  Buy it right away.
I can't reccomend this DVD any stronger than to tell you after watching the DVD and practicing  the skills and drills for a week I scored 3 goals in the very next game I played!  I'd of paid alot more than the $19.95 for that to happen!!!",1081814400,37,1956,4.473239436619719
1261525,5,B000034DM3,This video was excellent from beginning to end.  A great instructional video for adults and kids alike.  It gives you tons of detail to help improve all your shots.,1044748800,2,164,4.620689655172414
1261526,5,B000034DM3,"First half of this 35 minute video is full of Brett Hull demonstrating and clearly explaining his technique in the wrist shot, snap shot, professional snap shot, one-timer, slap shot, backhand, as well as fakes and dekes.  Outstanding repetition and slow motion footage.  Second half of tape focuses on shooting drills and is a must watch for every youth hockey or high school hockey coach.  Brett and Bobby Jr. do an excellent job together in this video.  Several cameos of dear old Dad...Bobby Hull, Sr.  A must for every player and hockey Dad!",1016582400,6,546,4.827956989247312
1261527,4,B000034DM3,"Brett Hull is one of the fiercest scorers in the NHL today, so it is appropriate that he's brother puts out an instructional tape on shooting and scoring using Brett for examples. Bobby Hull, Jr. actually does pretty well in front of the camera in his explanations of the shooting techniques so this video doesn't come across as cheesy.
This video deals in teaching the wrist-shot, backhand, snap-shot and slap shot, and how each shot basically builds on the one before it. Bobby does well explaining the position of the body and puck for each shot. He stresses the importance of the drive off the back leg and the follow through of the stick towards the target. One of the hints that Bobby gives is not to look to see where the goalie is, but where he isn't. In essence, shoot for the empty part of the net instead of trying to shoot around the goalie. Finally, the Hulls' end with on-ice drills to improve your shooting technique.
The reason that I purchased the video was to learn how to transfer my weight through the stick to give more power to my shot. Bobby goes over this very briefly during the slap-shot segment and only shows this as a still shot of Brett's stick bending in a large arc. Unfortunately, this wasn't helpful to me, and I could have used a little more explanation to get this very important technique correct.
The only way to get better at shooting is to shoot as much as you can. This tape will help make sure that you have the right form and are performing all the components of a shot the correct way. The Hulls' close by stating that you should be taking 200 shots a week to improve. With limited ice time for adult recreational leagues, 200 is a tough number unless you're shooting off the ice.",1015977600,,1724,4.458860759493671
1261528,5,B000034DM3,"This video repetitively shows all of the classic shot types in full speed, slow motion, different views, in different ways, in a professional and entertaining way.  It also contains many good tips on shooting and scoring.  I highly recommend it.  I plan to view portions of it over and over again, working on one shot type at a time at the rink.",1013299200,3,345,4.532258064516129
1261529,5,B000034DM3,"This video is very good. Because Brett's shooting action is too fast, more demo in different angle of view, close up and slow motion can make this video perfect.",1004227200,,161,4.586206896551724
1261530,5,B000034DM3,Great Video.  Explains all the shots and how to do them correctly.  Helpful drills for coaching.  Highly recommended to improve your shooting.,996710400,,142,5.363636363636363
1261531,5,B000034DM3,"There's probably nobody in the world who knows more about shooting the puck than the Hull family.  Bobby Hull, Jr is the instructor while current NHL player and future hall of fame brother Brett demonstrate the basics of the forehand, snap, slap, backhand and one-timer shots.  Even their father Bobby makes a couple brief appearances.  They show slow and stop motion images displaying feet and stick position and weight transfer for every step of the shots.  I've found this video helpful but you must be able to practice these techniques immediately on the ice to get maximum results, which can be difficult at times.  Overall, it's a great tool to improve your game for all ages.",982540800,6,682,4.844827586206897
1261532,5,B000034DM3,"Highly recommend this video!  The Hull brothers do a great job showing kids and adults how to really shoot the puck with effectiveness.  My kids, ages 5 and 7, love to watch and then go on the ice and try to emulate what they see.  Good value!",978048000,3,243,4.127659574468085
7917090,4,B000034DM3,"classic shots with bobby, his brother and his dad.  if you are a fan of the hulls, this is a must have.",1412121600,,103,3.6818181818181817
7917091,4,B000034DM3,The quality was great although I thought it was supposed to be a DVD.  Great hints and tips for players.  If you like the Hulls it's a great VHS.,1321574400,,145,3.9655172413793105
7917092,2,B000034DM3,"I strongly recommend you get Sean Skinner's dvd series Stickhandling Beyond Belief. While it is not dealing with scoring, Skinner's dvd will do a lot more for a player of any skill level than this short dvd. This is mainly for brute beginners and children.",1210204800,,256,4.711111111111111
7917093,5,B000034DM3,"I have played hockey since I was 4 years old and ended playing Junior hockey in Detroit. Some of my fellow teammates, and some of my opponents went on to play in the NHL. I have also coached mite, squirt, peewee, bantam and midget. I wish this video was around during my coaching days because Brett and Bobby Hull Jr. have produced the most valuable, professional and comprehensive shooting video ever. The Hulls have a clearly defined way of peeling away the layers of shooting, and describing it in simple terms so that novice through highly skilled players can understand. The slow motion sequences are simply awesome! In my opinion, no one shoots the puck more purely than Brett Hull and this video demonstrates how other players can adapt his technique and 'rip' the puck as well. Kudos to Brett, Bobby and Bobby Jr. for making this video available to the masses. I just became a bigger Hull fan!!!",1201046400,,903,4.685534591194968
7917094,4,B000034DM3,"Great DVD, but what you need is to go on the ice.
Good luck!",1200528000,,60,3.357142857142857
7917095,5,B000034DM3,My son is 13 and plays in Los Angeles for his midget AAA team.  He has easily watched this dvd 50 times to the point I feel as if I know Bobby Hull Jr!  His voice comes out of my son's room every weekend!  That would be annoying to most parents but my son has been scoring alot more goals and has even trying to explain to me the mechanics of scoring goals like Brett Hull.  He was going to spend more time skateboarding and playing football but since he has improved so much at hockey and enjoying it more he really wants to pursue it further.  Thank you Bobby Hull!,1189382400,,567,4.072072072072072
7917096,5,B000034DM3,I have watched this video many times already in the two months I have owned it.  I highly recommend it.  It is informative and fun to watch some of the highlight film within the film.,1179100800,,183,4.2
7917097,5,B000034DM3,"This DVD is one of ""the must to"" for training every age hockey players...",1169251200,,73,4.285714285714286
7917098,5,B000034DM3,"After taking a short 17 years off from hockey, getting back into it seriously was a challenge. I took a few adult learn-to-play classes and there wasn't much, if any, focus on shooting. A majority of it was spent on passing and moving. After doing some homework, I took the plunge and bought the video. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT!! I was literally hitting the crossbar after watching the wrist shot segment a few times and practicing the principles as they were explained for about 20 minutes.

The explanations, demonstrations, dry-land walk & talk through as well as the on-ice real-time and slow motion video from multiple angles with on-screen highlighting is absolutely phenominal. It pointed out everything I was doing wrong. Within minutes I had corrected the basic problems and was hitting the goal. After about 20 minutes of practicing, I was putting the puck exactly where I wanted it. The folks I play with noticed the difference too. I scored 2 points last game; I was playing defense and hit them from the blue line! I am no longer the ""sympathy pass"" receiver and am now on the forward line instead of defense.

If you're in the market for a very detailed, step-by-step instructional dvd to get you shooting like a pro in short order, this is the video for you! I can't wait until the pond freezes over to get out and try the drills at the end of the video.",1168128000,6,1366,4.617283950617284
7917099,5,B000034DM3,"Having started playing hockey as an adult there were a lot of basics that I had missed....how to properly tape a stick, correct stick length,etc...this video covered them all. Clearly explains the fundamentals of shooting and more importantly scoring goals. My shot has improved a ton after applying the techniques described here....pick it up and watch for your name on the scoresheet after every game!!!",1129939200,9,405,5.246153846153846
