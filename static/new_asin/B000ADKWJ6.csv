8077920,5,B000ADKWJ6,"Very good! Why NOT a movie? Romi really has enhanced the positive aspects of HIGH-TECH with true value, not to mention Harper 'done good' in re-packaging.  (NOT all androids have hateful minds as HOLLYWOOD depicts, nor go to extreme opposite) However, I don't think ANY kid would see the intelligence in your concept, so drop the cartoon intro....and yes, my grand-kids are 'that' age.",1179100800,,385,5.015625
8077921,5,B000ADKWJ6,Absolutely loved season 5.  Kevin Sorbo and Steve Bacic are just brilliant in these season.,1152057600,2,91,5.066666666666666
8077922,5,B000ADKWJ6,"I HAVE COLLECTED ALL THE ANDROMEDA SEASONS AND THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER.  IN THIS SEASON THE WRITERS HAVE GIVEN ALL THE CAST A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT GREAT ACTORS THEY ARE.  KEVIN IS JUST AWESOME AND I LOVE TO WATCH HIM.  HE IS CAPTAIN DYLAN HUNT WITHOUT A DOUBT.

8077923,5,B000ADKWJ6,"For a show with a low budget, Season # 5 has plenty of creativity. The writing is very good, the stories are interesting and well conected to the bible of the show.

The actors are very good and Kevin Sorbo is amazing!

It's been a pleasure watching, indeed.

Thank you, guys!

I was beginning to wonder if ADV was ever going to release these five individual volumes or whether they'd just go with a box set for the whole season.

Unfortunately, I've bought this series the expensive way with the individual volumes, so I plan on finishing it that way.  Too bad too as the box sets are a lot cheaper than going the individual volume way.  But what is a collector to do?

I give this release 3 stars only because it has taken this long to get it release, and let's face it, Andromeda has not been that great of a series since Season 1.",1122854400,6,715,4.371212121212121
