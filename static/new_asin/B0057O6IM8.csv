4597116,4,B0057O6IM8,Very interesting and sad story.  The movie was a little slow at times but I couldn't stop watching.,1410393600,,99,4.5
4597117,3,B0057O6IM8,"Having went to grammar school with Catherine, I was not surprised at all to hear of the news about her. I was at her house several times, I was friends with her for awhile. Does this tell the story of her and her brother and their family dynamic..yes..BUT not once does Andrew say he's sorry for killing Robert. He does take responsibility, but with a confession and all the evidence how could he not? He basically just took her word that Robert was the one who killed their mother, point blank no questions. Robert and Catherine probably did kill her mother. Whether they hired people to do it or did it themselves I don't know. Since they were each other's alibi's, it's likely they were both involved. This was interesting to me because I knew the family.  It basically documents their life and events leading up to the murder. Do I feel sorry for either of them..uh no. Catherine a seemingly sociopath and Andrew who at any point when he was waiting in that garage could have put two and two together and realized the person his sister really was, and dropped the gun and just walk away. He had four hours basically to go over eveything she's ever done or told him..yet for him no epiphany. Did they have tragic events happen to them..yes..but thank goodness everyone that has ever not been loved, or lost one or both parents at a young age, haven't gone on to be a murderer. They are both where they belong. Catherine has since disowned him, telling him to never contact her again. Wonder if NOW he has had that epiphany?",1409961600,8,1526,4.509025270758123

4597119,2,B0057O6IM8,"I don't understand what the dramatic conflict of this documentary is.  The guilty are guilty and they got caught and are now punished.  Happens all the time.  There's no dramatic mystery here.  No noir-ish, man-wrongly-accused conflict at all.  They all got caught and got what they deserved.  So what?",1407542400,7,302,5.061224489795919

4597123,5,B0057O6IM8,"This is one of the most tragic, sad and beautifully told documentaries that I have seen in a long, long time. The story of the House of Suh family is both haunting and thought provoking in its entirety...from a promising beginning to the very sad ending.

As a viewer, you really can't look away once you start watching this incredible documentary because It is so profound and it will leave some viewers asking themselves following question:

What would you do if you were asked to do the unthinkable...all in the name of love and blinding loyalty for the only family member that you had left in the world?

The subject of this documentary, Andrew Suh, is (in my humble opinion), a remarkable and very forgiving man. This is one documentary that will stick with you long after you finish viewing it...",1395273600,29,802,4.673758865248227
4597124,1,B0057O6IM8,"This documentary is an attempt to warp the past, and in essence, the truth about Andrew. I knew him through grammar and high school and he was an unrepentant thug and bully. The path his life took may be dramatic and tragic, but it was not unforeseen. It takes a certain lack of conscience and true evil to shoot a man in cold blood.",1372723200,33,333,4.21875
4597125,5,B0057O6IM8,Very well done documentary. I knew Andrew Suh-went to grade school with him. He was always a really nice guy and saw him here and there up until this last of a series of tragic events in this man's life. There are several people in this story that are both victims and criminals. This is a lesson in the choices we make.,1353110400,16,320,4.17741935483871

4597127,4,B0057O6IM8,"Not knowing about this case beforehand, I was dubious about watching this documentary.  I found myself fascinated and full of compassion, especially toward the brother who was sentenced to 100 years in jail.  What a tragic family and story!",1482105600,,240,5.128205128205129
4597128,4,B0057O6IM8,"Very sad documentary,  you do feel bad for Andrew and the lot he had in life- however, you also feel bad for Robert's family especially since the brother that was interviewed seems like such a likable person.  You're also left wondering about Catherine and what role exactly she played in her mother's murder.

Andrew is clearly in denial regarding his mother's murder. Maybe Robert is an accomplice but there's no way Catherine wasn't a willing participant or the one that set it up.  Catherine caused a lot of pain and while it's never confirmed exactly what her issue was or why her parents disliked her so much......... it is odd, you know, that they suspected she had some role in her older brother's death and most of us here seem inclined to believe she had a role in her mother's death- she definitely had a role in Robert's death and helping to put her brainwashed brother into prison for life (he ultimately chose to listen to her, though).",1478908800,,950,4.636904761904762

4597130,5,B0057O6IM8,"My heart breaks for this young man becasue I truly believe he was a victim. I will be careful not to spoiler it, but this is one of the most well done docs on a crime I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them! It's not sensationalized, it works very hard to be objective and give you all the information to make your own conclusion. It is not fast paced, but it is engrossing, and I really want to just give this guy a hug. I personally don;t believe he is dangerous outside of what he was manipulated into",1478476800,,510,4.009803921568627

4597133,5,B0057O6IM8,"I love true crime and documentaries so when I came across this one, I had to watch it.  Personally, I thought the documentary was very well done.  At one point (maybe 2....lol) I started feeling sorry for everyone involved.  By the end, I believe Catherine is the one who killed the mother (too many stab wounds to be a random act/hired kill.....there was too much rage in the killing.....kinda like Jodi Arias), told the fiance what she did, she wanted to leave him but he was blackmailing her about going to the police, told Andrew that he's the one who killed their mother and so to avenge his mother's death, he had to kill him (well.....according to what Catherine possibly told him). The fact that she took off, speaks volumes (when you're innocent, you don't run)!!  Very sad story all the way around!!  In my opinion, innocent lives were taken because of possible jealousy (Catherine being jealous of how her parents treated/loved Andrew more than her....just guessing) and greed!!",1476144000,5,989,4.828402366863905
4597134,4,B0057O6IM8,A well thought out documentary. I agree with another reviewer that the flashes of hand draw cartoon type drawings are rather interesting...it made me wonder if the defendant drew them. I'd not heard of this case so it was an interesting case to think through.,1475539200,,259,4.777777777777778
4597135,4,B0057O6IM8,"I decided to watch this, because I am a true crime insomniac. It started with Bill Kurtis's voice, and from there, I went on to subscribe to Investigation Discovery. The one hour documentaries are interesting when I cannot sleep, and, for reasons I will never understand, just monotone enough to fall asleep to when I can sleep. But there's no way to get that channel if you are a cord cutter (no legal way that I know of, anyway).

I do not recommend this documentary for falling asleep. It has the low key narration of other true crime documentaries, but it is way too engaging and sad. The story of these kids - particularly the cultural elements that really doomed both of them - is heartbreaking. As a viewer - and a mom - I just felt for both of them: the one who never had a chance and the one who maybe could have made it but chose instead to ""help"" the one who was never going to be okay.

Really thought-proving stuff about domestic abuse, especially how the way the family scapegoat is treated harms the bystanders as well, especially when there is extreme loyalty (whether stemming from fear or genuine fealty) to the abuser.",1475193600,2,1137,4.48792270531401

4597138,5,B0057O6IM8,I really enjoyed this documentary. How loyal the brother was to his Korean family makes you think how other cultures deal with traditions according to their heritage.,1474416000,,166,5.185185185185185
4597139,4,B0057O6IM8,"I was floored and kept focus of the story as it unfolded. A true story of what will happen while making choices and the rewards or punishment of our decisions.

4597146,4,B0057O6IM8,"Such a sad story. Andrew sums it up nicely himself when he says, ""I was a product of my environment.""

As a documentary I believe they did a good job.  This is a doc for someone who likes docs or true crime though, as it does not have as many entertaining details as some of the more mainstream documentaries out there.  If you are a casual doc watcher, you might want to avoid this one. I found some of the delivery a bit dry, but I was interested in the story, so I kept watching.  The end will really get you because it is almost as though this poor guy was destined to his downfall.  He was forced to grow up so fast, deal with tragedy, and then was left with nothing.  His sister seems like a sociopath, and it is terrible how she leaves him.
I like that Andrew is self-aware enough to know that what he did was wrong, and he admits to being a murderer. He never seems to try to shy away from that or plea to be let out of his punishment.  Rather it is an exploration into how something like this can happen and what can motivate people. I do not want to give away the twist, but I think it happened the way they say, and I hope the case in Illinois will one day be traced back to who is responsible.
Such a sad story for everyone involved.  The havoc that one person could create and then just dismiss themselves from all of it is tragic.",1463788800,5,1344,4.0643939393939394

4597149,5,B0057O6IM8,"the documentary is well done. it's engaging and interesting. it's a reminder that murder isn't always as cut and dry as we'd like it to be.
I also learned a great deal about Korean culture and the circumstances of this kid's life that lead him to
murder. in my simple opinion on the evidence presented by the documentary, he should be allowed free after 30 years or so. his sister should have the life sentence!

it's definitely worth a viewing!",1463270400,2,445,4.5625
4597150,4,B0057O6IM8,"This. in many ways, was a very depressing movie.  I was a very good documentation in how much influence our attitude effects our life, and the lives of those around us.  Lots of ""food for thought""!",1463184000,,197,4.444444444444445

4597155,5,B0057O6IM8,"Wow. I had not heard of this murder before watching this documentary, so I was not familiar with the crime or people involved. I found the doc to be very interesting and well-done as far as in re-telling of the crime and also the back story of the Suh family. Tragedy, pure and simple and not only for the victim's family but for the Suh family. This is a very informative and heart-wrenching documentary. Although the crime was horrible, I found myself having sympathy for Andrew. It's hard not to once all of the elements of the story is told, especially realizing his dilemma with feeling the need to support and defend his ONLY living relative. The fact that she manipulated and lied to him, used him for her evil intentions, then left him all alone, absconding to another country, makes me realize how cold and heartless she truly is. Excellent documentary; would highly recommend it to all audiences.",1455753600,8,906,4.70440251572327

4597157,5,B0057O6IM8,"Amazing documentary. Some fool thought this was not a documentary because they showed ""cartoon drawings,"" which in fact were sketches sporadically inserted throughout this fine documentary in lieu of the film makers not being able to shoot actual footage of the family from like 20 years ago.

4597162,5,B0057O6IM8,"I appreciated reading the other reviews ahead of time. I'm a true crime documentary junkie. I certainly try to recognize the bias of the film makers. They always put a slant on their subjects. This film is no different. However, this is still one of the very first books or films I have ever seen where I actually understood where the antagonist was coming from. Exploring his background and history helped me understand his actions. I would never condone or suspend judgement on a confessed murderer. I'm not sure if that is what the film makers are asking us to do here... But it is certainly a compelling and thought provoking look into a family tragedy. Gives you a glimpse of how this family, and others like it, fall apart.

I do not have sympathy for Andrew, but I certainly enjoyed a compelling documentary about his background and his family. One of the best documentaries I have seen in a while.",1453507200,2,905,4.62111801242236

4597164,5,B0057O6IM8,"This was an interesting documentary. I will say that I feel bad for Andrew and his sister. I feel bad for his sister as well. She was pretty much an outcast. I'm not not justifying either or their actions but its very thought provoking. Feel bad about the victim but I do believe he killed the mother. Certain signs to me seem he did it. Robert didn't feel he needed to pay taxes, he didn't pay his tickets, he changed his name to avoid paying taxes,  he was sporatic and never stuck to anything. Its like what planet are you living on that you feel as if you are so above the law. I have no doubt he conspired with the sister to kill the mother.",1451174400,2,646,4.126984126984127

4597170,5,B0057O6IM8,"Really engrossing, fascinating documentary, particularly for we are interested in how families, early childhood experiences and culture shape people. Not liking to appeal to people whose preference is Action or PsyFi genre and/or hold black and white law-based vs. morality based legal codes Likely to appeal to people who don't believe  all children, and even 19 year olds, have equal control over, and ability to 'make good or bad decisions'. If you believe some people, under some circumstances,  don't have true freedom of choice even though there is no gun trained on their head, even though not under physical restraint. I believe both kids were shaped by their treatment by their parents; I believe their relationship was shaped by the parental treatment. I think this documentary really indicates how two children can grow up in the same household and yet be treated completely differently, have dramatically different relationships with their parents and childhoods that overlap yet have spectacular differences. As kids both siblings , IMO, oth siblings, invoke  compassion. Only the heartless would fail to feel sympathy for the daughter when a child; she deserved protection and love. Sadly, by adulthood, she is likely permanently dangerous. I don't believe that of the son. But I am a liberal woman with a Masters in Psychology.

Yeah right. The story about him avenging his mother's death makes no sense. Why didn't he go to the police if he thought Robert killed his mother -- he claims because Catherine told him not to -- she might be implicated. Well, if she had nothing to do with the mother's murder, what was she worried about? OTOH, Robert barely knew his mother; he had just started seeing Catherine shortly before the mother was murdered. Therefore, stabbing the mother over 30 times, in no way fits the so-called motive for Robert--get the inheritance money. However, the horrific multiple stabbing does perfectly fit a murder that would've been committed by Catherine--multiple stabbings are done by those who are very close to the victim; the killer is filled with rage and hatred. After having been dismissed her entire life by both of her parents, she finely took her revenge, and got the inheritance as a reward. Hogwash sob story.",1431216000,,1091,4.839572192513369

4597178,3,B0057O6IM8,"The Suhs.  A Korean family who immigrated to the United States hoping for a better life and the American Dream.  Unfortunately, the dream was a nightmare of extreme family dysfunction, cultural clashes, high expectations, and a lack of love.  An environment like this could be a recipe for disaster for some children.

That's where Andrew and Cathrine Suh come in.  The difference between the two siblings is strikingly stark; Catherine is the rebellious wild-child that feels like she shouldn't have to work as hard as her parents to get her American Dream.  She rebels against the Korean status quo, which brings great shame to her family.  Andrew is your typical ""model minority;"" he excels in school, is popular, and has plenty of friends.  He also is easily led into things he doesn't think through. As he is the only son, he is doted on by both his parents and becomes the male fill-in after his father dies.  Things take a more tragic turn after Mrs. Suh is murdered in her dry cleanining shop, and to this day remains unsolved.

With both parents gone, Catherine Suh can finally live the American Dream, at least through her brother's inheritance (Catherine was left out of that).  Although she is Andrew's guardian she parties, wears expensive clothes, and moves to a ritzy condo.  She was living the dream until the cash cow was running dry and Catherine got tired of her boyfriend Randy, who threatened to ""talk"" about a murder in a dry cleaning store a few years back.  Panicked, Cathrine concocts a strange story of abuse and plays on Andrew's sympathies and need for tradition to have him remedy the situation by killing Randy.  The case falls apart almost immediately and the Siblings Suh are arrested and let out on bond.  That's when Catherine goes on the run, leaving Andrew to take the fall to be sentences to life in prison.  Eventually Catherine is captured, and she too receives a life sentence.

The House of Suh is a good documentary, and examines the dynamics of Korean culture and why Andrew Suh did not testify against his sister after she put him under the bus.  Most reasonable people would have testified against their co-accomplice, especially after what Catherine did to Andrew.  As the sole male Suh that was unthinkable and a dishonor to the family.

It is clear that Catherine Suh is a sociopath.  She thought little of the rights of others when it came to her needs, her desires, her dreams.  There's a pretty good chance she and the murder victim are the killers of Mrs. Suh, whose struggles were in vain because two grifters wanted to be something they truly were not. Her cold, unloving father may have been the precursor to her sociopathic tendencies.  However, there's a reasonable chance she may have been born this way.

As for Andrew, he was put on a pedestal and didn't have the fortitude to fill in the role his parents had in store.  He was perfectly happy to stay the model minority, even if that meant suppressing his own needs, wants, judgement, and freedom to keep his status.  Is he an innocent person?  It's not hard to get people like Andrew on board to something deviant when a sociopath is behind it, but he's no Angel.

Although not the finest documentary, it throughly examines the case and many aspects of the Suhs family dynamics.",1430784000,2,3290,4.724561403508772

I think that in 1 hour and 33 minutes, the filmmakers did their best to give the viewers the whole story, from beginning to end, which is very hard to do.  I saw that some reviewers had no sympathy for Andrew and called him a sociopath, but I don't believe that was the case here.  I truly believe the sister Catherine was born a sociopath, (maybe some genetic history here, who knows) but her actions spoke louder than her words.  I truly believe that Andrew was ""brainwashed"" as that is what sociopaths, narcissists, and psychopaths do to their VICTIMS.  It is too bad that the death of the mother cannot be solved, but I would bet that the dead boyfriend did not do it.  I don't believe he had any reason to kill her girlfriends mom by stabbing her 34 times, a crime of hatred and passion that could only have been carried out by the sociopath/psychopath sister.  I feel for Andrew. He was a young, angry man who was manipulated by someone (Catherine) that he loved and trusted.  It's sad such a promising young man's life could end up so tragically.",1430611200,15,1139,4.463768115942029

4597183,5,B0057O6IM8,"Truly captivating until the credits rolled. I do think the storytelling was as evenhanded as it can be, though I personally came away with a fairly strong sense that the sister pulled strings leading to (spoiler alert!) both murders. One of the best true crime documentaries Ive seen, and I hungrily devour these twisted tales on sleepless nights (totally normal, I know lol) so thats saying something! I think what makes The House of Suh unique is that, by providing a much broader history of the main players (in keeping with the genealogy theme) and the exponential dynamics between them, the point of focus becomes more deeply psychological than formulaic (think dateline) accounts where its all about who dunnit. I liked that this film avoided that simplistic and easy sensational approach by spending so much time developing the story so we come away thinking more about the multitude of circumstances and events leading to the crime(s).

I can understand the feeling held by some (at least one of whose well written and thought provoking review can be seen on this thread) that the face Andrew shows in the filmed interviews is fake - a facade built to promote sympathy using the talents seemingly ingrained in so many sociopathic criminals - and I allowed my mind to wander that way in contemplation many times throughout the movie. Im on the fence, but my gut says I did not see THAT kind of act in Andrew. The convicted man exhibits a dramatic confusion about his own identity (whether you believe this to be genuine or put-on), such as would make sense given the psychological trajectory Andrew experienced between birth and adulthood. Point being, its easy to understand how he could become this way given the facts laid out in the film, and while I didn't take it as such, I must acknowledge the possibility that in exhibiting the very specific maladaptive qualities which seem appropriate following these very specific life events/circumstances is arguably the most commonly shared talent among sociopathic personalities.",1425513600,9,2035,5.002949852507375
4597184,4,B0057O6IM8,Very good.,1425081600,,10,4.5
4597185,3,B0057O6IM8,"Andrew just didn't ring honest to me.  I just didn't buy him as a 100% victim, or feel like I got his real motivation for committing such a heinous crime.  I think it had more to do with Robert spending his trust fund rather than family honor (the documentary only showed Andrew discuss this VERY briefly).  Andrew shot a person in cold blood, and it irritates me that this documentary seemed to go very easy on him.

As bad as it sounds, I actually felt more sympathy for Catherine after watching this documentary.  Don't get me wrong, she is a terrible, evil person.  But her parents sure played a large part in her becoming that way.  What a sad life...her parents not valuing her as a girl, showing her no love, blaming her for the death of her older brother, and just treating her poorly in general.  They left her nothing when they died, except the responsibility of caring for her younger brother and managing the trust with all of the assets that they left to him.  So she is certainly a bad person, but what came first, the chicken or the egg?  Did she become a bad person because she was raised with no love?  Or did she have such a poor relationship with her parents because of what she was?

This would have been a much more interesting documentary if they had actually talked to Catherine, and included her perspective.",1424563200,5,1332,4.458677685950414

4597191,5,B0057O6IM8,"I really enjoyed this film! It was extremely detailed and authentic, which is quite refreshing. The (background) dynamics of the family  and the relationships there from the time Andrew & Catherine were babies, brought everything to life intensely as the story was told throughout the film. But what's sad is after watching it (with a little time afterwards to finish absorbing what happened), it really just leaves a picture of yet another family that starts off with so much going for them, but regardless they all slowly self-destruct, end of dead (or in Andrew's case in prison).",1415404800,,583,5.010309278350515
4597192,3,B0057O6IM8,"I hate it when a book, a film, any medium for that matter, tries to play with my emotions.  This manipulation actually invokes an emotion itself, usually either anger or disgust.  This is exactly why I hate shows such as ""Oprah,"" and on a slightly-lesser scale, ""Ellen.""  It is simply liberal gibberish; it uses a lame appeal-to-emotion fallacy on all fronts.

And the film ""House of Suh"" (HOS) is certainly guilty of this.  And maybe even more.

And this is really too bad, since some of the production values, in particular the animation, is really well done.  I actually really liked this film at the start, particularly when family history was explained, and it really started to draw me in.  But by the third act I just thought that the actors were really just acting up myself.

Supposedly, Andrew Suh, the man who killed his sister's ex-fianc -- Robert O'Dubaine -- has been petitioning recently for a review of his case.  He received a 100-year sentence for murder -- yes, perhaps excessive, but I believe the death penalty was originally on the table, and so just being alive may be a gift -- and he wants this sentence reduced.  Fair enough.  Taxes are certainly too high, and I want them reduced too, but it's not going to happen.

One huge issue that I have here:  Mr. Suh's mother was murdered, and the film tries to make you sympathize with him because of it, but then afterwards he kills someone himself.  This made it really difficult for me to feel compassion for him.  But this compassion is further reduced when he and his lawyer compound his crime by arguing that Mr. O'Dubaine was Mrs. Suh's murderer.  They complain that the cops wouldn't do anything about it, and so Mr. Suh needed to ""exact revenge to honor his mother"" or some other such nonsense.

I don't buy it, and neither should you.

But I really did like Kevin Koron.  He is the brother of Mr. O'Dubaine (the name difference is too complicated to explain, so I won't and you'll have to watch the documentary to understand), and Mr. Koron is heavily featured.  He seems to be very level-headed about all of this chaos, and he reminded me a lot of Paul Giamatti.  But while he could easily play the ""victim card,"" he seems to not only forgive the killers, but understand their possible motivations as well.  At any rate, I found Mr. Koron to be pretty funny and engaging.

One thing that really bothered me while watching:  this case was an Asian killing a white man.  Now, that didn't bother me, other than the murder, but if the situation had been reversed -- a white man killing an Asian -- the Asian community would have come out en masse, claiming that a Hate Crime had been committed. You won't see the reverse, however, and I always believe that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  But this documentary didn't address this obvious discrepancy, which it should have; it is always best, when giving an argument, to anticipate and address your opponent's rebuttal before he even has a chance to speak.

But what probably bothered me the most:  I realized while watching that if I had committed this crime myself, no one would give a rat's a-- about me.  And they wouldn't give a rat's a-- about you either.  And that's why I say that, while Mr. Suh shouldn't necessarily rot in prison, you might just want to not give a rat's a-- about him as well.  What comes around goes around, as they say.

Too bad on a film that had its serious pluses, but even bigger minuses.",1415232000,5,3465,4.546042003231018

I found this doc did a great job of telling the tragic story of a family and how their own terrible trajectory and self centered behavior resulted in the death of the victim. I'm mystified by those who thought it was sympathetic to Andrew or his sister in any way. I found it to be even handed story telling and, at least to me, he seemed like he was full of crap and trying to make people sympathetic with the sort of hallow finesse you'd expect from a sociopath who's been caught. In my opinion, the documentary tells the story, but never gives him or his sister a free pass. Heck, even Gacy and equally famous evil people tried to do what this guy does when interviewed. If you look at it in contrast to the rest of the story though, I find it never excuses him.",1414540800,6,815,4.230769230769231

Robert O'Dubaine's brother remains pitifully loyal while describing his brother's obvious sociopathic personality traits, narcissistic behaviors, illegal dealings, and ol' fashioned cahoots.

Similarly, Christine's totally Histrionic and no one sees it --the clothes, the sexual manipulation, the egocentrism, the self-indulgence, the list goes on. And Andrew.
