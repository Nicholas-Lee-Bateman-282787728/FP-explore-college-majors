The full story of psychobilly is not here...apparently there were supposed to be sequels but so far none have come out.  Regardless, this DVD is worth watching if you like picking apart movies to expose both strengths and weaknesses.  It must be noted that whether you love or hate this movie, it will entertain you on some level.  You will either be well-entertained or badly-entertained...heh.  For some reason nobody had put out a psychobilly documentary before this one, so this flick is a pioneering piece of work just based on that alone.  Features funny & informative interviews with some of my favorite psychobilly personalities like Kim Nekroman, P Paul Fenech, Pip (Guana Batz, Nick 13 (Tiger Army), Spike Baller, Destin Pledger, and even the singer for Battle of Ninjamanz (with English translator). Live footage from The Meteors, Nekromantix, Koffin Kats, Barnyard Ballers, Phantom Rockers, and a ton of others.  As far as I know, this DVD is out of print so grab one if you can find it!",1290470400,,1170,4.969230769230769
8366212,1,B000FBFTV4,"I can't stress enough how dissappointing this DVD is. Clearly the producers weren't able to clear synch and footage rights for most of the bands that feature the subjects of their interviews (which themselves suffer from either boring responses or poor audio). In fact, one of many problems with this DVD is its overall lack of musical content. If you're trying to open up people's eyes to this subculture, you have to start with the MUSIC first. While it was ""great"" hearing people say over and over that The Meteors started it all, if you actually want to see and hear their classic performances or if you're a fan (or even just curious) about the cult of psychobilly, go elsewhere and pick up the ""Blood On The Cats"" and ""Stompin' At The Klub Foot"" DVDs for historic live performances from the UK psychobilly greats.",1153872000,,819,4.694444444444445
