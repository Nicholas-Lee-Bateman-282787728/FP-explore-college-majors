I seen each episode almost every day until the new one came out that is how hooked I am. My husband thinks I'm crazy :) I still have a few books to complete but the series Is just as exciting as the books I'm going crazy just having to wait for the new season in April .

6520048,5,B00M0GMC26,"**Edit**
I did more research and this is a legit product. I apologize to anyone who may have been influenced by my negative review. Changed to 5 stars because I love the books/series, though I will personally wait until the full season comes out to purchase.

Total scam! The second half of season 1 doesn't even start until April.  There's no way it can be released on DVD or blu - ray in March.  At least it's an easy catch.",1421712000,43,426,4.3

6520231,4,B00M0GMC26,"One can't help but get drawn in.  The twists and turns keep you guessing!  While I am not a prude, I do feel they could have shown a greater degree of modicum and decency regarding the ridiculously numerous "" sex scenes"".  Honestly, instead of the somewhat graphic nature, I feel it could have been more tastefully executed by eluding to the obvious rather than giving a nearly complete show.  It certainly is NOT a movie you would feel comfortable watching with a younger audience.",1528156800,,482,4.7023809523809526
6520232,2,B00M0GMC26,"The production values are good. But the story line gets worse and worse. It turns out, I hate romance. I hate that she's in all these fancy dresses. Really? Who's paying for all of that for this woman who just shows up out of nowhere? The worst was the multiple attempted rape scenes (again and again and again in just the first season), including one in which we get a flash of her sexy behind. There is absolutely nothing sexy about rape, and sexualizing it is abhorrent. When Jamie bursts in to declare the attacker get away from his wife, I was done: Dude, shoot the attacker now. End of story.",1528156800,,598,4.396396396396397
6520233,3,B00M0GMC26,"Geillis Duncan was my favorite character from the first book. She was a hero during the witch trial as she decided to incriminate herself in a theatrical performance of witchness in front of the town's people. She didn't want Claire her friend to be burned. There are quite a few things different in the film version compared to the book. Of course the books are better and specifically Geillis was an extremely brave, enigmatic strong character in the book. Geillis was basically Claire's only female friend and their friendship was closer in the book even if Claire was against the murder. The book also makes Jamie a more psychologically complicated character.",1527984000,,663,4.981981981981982
6520234,5,B00M0GMC26,I had read the book and Season 1 Collector's Edition of the DVD did not disappoint. It was wonderful and followed the book really well.

6520237,2,B00M0GMC26,I love the story line but the sexual content deminished the actual story. This was nothing more than soft porn and not necessary for the story. I won't be watching.,1527638400,2,164,4.5

6520240,2,B00M0GMC26,"I wanted to like this show, but I found the crude and vulgar sex scenes distasteful. I don't need to watch it to understand it's a part of life.

6520295,5,B00M0GMC26,"I could do without the graphic sex scenes because it makes it awkward to watch this with others or even recommend it. Besides this, it is a unique, surprisingly entertaining series with great acting. It's clear why there are almost ten thousand positive reviews about it. It's very appealing to women who like fantasy. There's a bit of actual history thrown in too.",1525910400,,365,4.809523809523809

6520408,1,B00M0GMC26,"Claire is like a modern day liberal feminist. I cannot stand her character! She is too aggressive and too immoral. Women were not like that back then!~ She is like the man in her relationship with Jamie and  seems about 15 years older than he . They are not suited as a couple.
it is pornographic and too explicit. Hollywood trash.",1520640000,,331,4.426229508196721
6520409,5,B00M0GMC26,"I bought this DVD during the Christmas 2017 holidays when Walmart had them for $5.00 or $7.88 to get people into their doors for the Christmas season.  I've heard some basic information about this series (probably from one of the award shows on TV) and I really enjoy period pieces, so I was intrigued.  After 3 months of sitting on this DVD, I actually had a little time to view this.  I've never heard of any of the actors and ended up binged watching the Season 1, volume 1.  It was a little slow at first to introduce the characters, but eventually picked up speed as the more of the story unfolds.  The movie writers did such a fine job with each character that it made me cared about what happens to each of the characters, whether they were good or bad guys, major or minor parts.  I felt like I was reading a book instead of watching a movie.  I commend each of the actors who did a phenomenal job in bringing each character to life.  The set people did an amazing job finding shooting locations that complemented and told such a rich story that I felt as though I was there in all the beauteous, overcast, muddy, bloody glory.  And the costumes ... I must say that the costumes are exquisite in simplicity and also in the more formal wear.  The love scenes in the movie was very intimate and sweet and done very well.  Once you watched the first DVD, you'll want to see more.  But most of all, thank the original book writer, Diana Gabaldon, who did an amazing job telling a story and weaving historical events into the story line.  Great characters, set, costumes, acting, and story.",1520640000,,1593,4.414383561643835

6520438,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is an incredible, authentic historical-fiction television series based on the first of eight books authored by Diana Gabaldon.  We had watched the first three episodes by the time we departed for England & Scotland in April 2017.  Loved being at Glencoe in the Highlands - home to my Clan MacDonell.  There are 16 episodes in Season 1.  There are some pretty explicit violent and sexual scenes in Episodes 15 and 16 that are difficult to watch, and I definitely think they could have been toned down for television.  In fact, the description of events in the book ""Outlander"" was not as graphic as was the movie.  With that being said, I would still highly recommend the series (which at this time has completed three seasons -- one for each corresponding volume).  Season 4 will be out in late 2018.

But from Lallybrook on, it is a very, very poor adaptation from the book and very powerful 'scenes' and parts of the book are left out. Very shallow treatment and very moving pieces are not there. Disappointing. Clair (Caitriona Balfe) is insipid and poorly played by the actress. (Although the author deals poorly with developing the depth of this character). Jamie, of course gorgeous, however (Sam Heugan) is excellent and is really what the books are about. Ordered STARZ just to be able to watch the series but not sure I can sit through much more of Claire!",1518566400,,648,4.643478260869565

6520661,4,B00M0GMC26,"I like this series. This review is about S1-S3.  It's based on historical facts such as the Jacobite Rebellion and some really interesting look on how the highlanders lived during those times (having a Chief and a War Chief and how they collect 'rent' and the conflict between the redcoats and such.) It also gives a good sense of cultural difference between the highlanders and the English & French (this is the 1700s when sex is everywhere and a taboo.) However, this is a LOVE story that cross time and country, so the focus is about the main characters. When i say Love, i meant LOVE. How spectacular it is for someone to love another so deeply that it's so gut wrenching? Their love seems so unrealistic but at the same time, it's so nice to watch a couple who has each other's heart and soul.

Pros:
-Historical insight of cultural differences and way of life
-Love that knows no bounds
-Gorgeous sets and landscapes that is both mystical and breath-taking
-Close to accurate description of costumes.
-Addressing homosexuality during this time period
-Medicinal limitation and diseases during the 1700s
-Action packed
-I've come to love the main characters for their respect for one another.

Cons:
-too much sex scenes (so no kids allowed)
-some details are extremely gory (battle scenes, sex scenes, prison scenes.)
-slow moving (i guess if you're going to make a 800+ pages book into a tv show, it has to move slow)
-too much filler in between critical scenes
-It seems as though the heroine here (Claire) is constantly getting herself into trouble and ultimately someone dies or gets hurt as a consequence. She only ever redeems herself when it comes to healing, but even being a healer has gotten herself in trouble plenty of times. However, the men in the show always saves the day or dies for the cause.

This is all my personal opinion and i understand if not everyone agrees. :) Bottom line is that this is a good show (aside from all the erotic scenes) and i'll continue to watch it. I can't wait to see what they do in America! BTW, i never read the books.",1515542400,,2073,4.640326975476839

6520664,5,B00M0GMC26,"I sort of agree at times it is soft porn, my only problem is it happens to often.  But it is not sex as it shows the soul deep love they have, for me, 62+, they just need to cut back on how often they show it, they do a great job most of the time, and often, with the deep connecting looks they give each other and please do not cut out those no words needed looks. As to plot I find no problem but maybe if one is a fan of the books you read between the lines that one who has not read the books is unable to follow a lot of the plot.

6520666,2,B00M0GMC26,"What truly is a great miniseries turned into a nightmare of  porn. It seems Hollywood once more relies on porn to depict what was a great love story. Im not sure what is more disturbing, the Hollywood directors who reveal their distorted and raunchy sense of human love and sexuality,  or an audience that is so hooked on porn it can't watch a great production without it!  I wanted to recommend this show to everyone but the raw sex makes that impossible, Such a shame the nudity and explicit sex was so demeaning to the viewers, actors And production crews,  I wish directors and producers would realize there are many many viewers who would rather they watch their porn in a dark theater, not inflict it on us at at home with the family.",1515024000,4,740,4.5

I did not find it to be soft porn though it was very sexual it was tender and the obvious culmination of a new love came though for me as full of tenderness, pathos, and even courage.  I though both actors handle what must of been a difficult series of scenes very well. They were very convincing in their trepidation and awkwardness with each other as it began and quite sweet and touching in their evolving passion and love. What woman wouldn't want a man to tell her ""you have my name, my clan, my family and if need be the protection of my body"" The giving of the pearls, the beautiful dress and how it was obtained, even the dastardly Dougal trying to horn in on Jamies now wife made for a very entertaining episode. I've watched it several times now and even on re-watching found nothing pornographic in it as to me for it to be porn it would have to be degrading and there was simply nothing degrading to either actor in their performances.",1514937600,5,987,4.364130434782608

My wife and I made the mistake of basing our initial decision on the high rating and ignoring reviews due to possible spoilers. Now having gone in and looked at other reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste any more time hoping it would get better (cleaner). Deep exploitation of intimate and/or horrific details does not make a good story better, but only corrupts it. The high ratings is an indicator that our culture has become callous and accepting of it. What happened to the days when one could blush?",1514851200,3,595,4.6761904761904765
6520675,5,B00M0GMC26,"This show is incredibly well done and as huge fan of the books I appreciate the effort that has clearly been taken to translate Diana Gabaldon's work to television. Outlander is atmospheric, beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted (for the most part) and it's truly a series you can get lost in. I appreciate just how authentic and believable everything is, from the costumes and sets to the gorgeous filming locations and the music, ect. I absolutely LOVE Sam Heughan as Jamie, he is spot on for the role and does a fantastic job bringing Jamie to life! I've personally been less impressed with Caitriona Balfe's portrayal of Claire, however. I'm not saying that she isn't a great actress, I just don't feel as though she is right for the role of Claire... she's grown on me a bit though but when I first starting watching this series, it was hard to accept her as Claire. She doesn't fit the image of Claire that I have in my head from reading the books. First of all she doesn't look how Claire is supposed to look (Claire has outrageously curly light brown hair and is shorter and curvier) and it's taken me a while to get past that. She's way too tall compared to Sam to be playing Claire: there is supposed to be a significant height difference between them. Sam is 6' 3"" (correct for Jamie) but Caitriona is 5' 10"" which isn't her fault at all obviously. I think that perhaps she's just not properly cast for the role... though I do understand that not all casting decisions can be perfect. Actually many of the actors are way too tall like the actor who plays Murtagh: Jamie's height is supposed to stand out majorly. I apologize for sounding too critical of Caitriona because I'm sure she's playing Claire the best that she can and she does have moments where she is great. It's not her as actress that is the problem, it's just I have a hard time comparing her to Claire in the books and not seeing the differences and being critical. Sorry for being picky... Book-Claire is just simply such a unique character that would be incredibly difficult for anyone to translate to screen so I do commend Caitriona on her effort. I also think the show spends far too much time on Frank/Jack Randall but I suppose Tobias Menzies has to get in his screen time... Overall I would strongly encourage anyone who enjoys the show Outlander to read the book series because the books are just SO MUCH better!",1514678400,2,2401,4.547344110854503
6520676,5,B00M0GMC26,"I love time travel, and this series takes it to a new level.  You become so entrenched with the characters and their time and space that you find yourself looking past the barbaric time in our world and focusing on the beauty, grace and nobility of the characters that, sadly, seems to be far removed from today's world.  The chemistry between Jamie and Claire leaps off the screen.",1514592000,,382,4.602941176470588

6520729,3,B00M0GMC26,"I'm not going to give this a 2 star review because I watched 7/8 episodes but the Outlander tv series is not that great. It seems predictable and the character development is weak. I don't even know why the main characters even like each other except perhaps physical attraction.  The development of the relationship is weak. These are not teenagers in puppy love. I might be prejudiced with this series because I have watched Poldark and read the books. Winston Graham is a phenomenal author and develops every character in detail and has an amazing ability to put you into the mind and historical times of the characters in the book. He is one of the great authors of all time and very little is predictable in Poldark but almost everything seems predictable in Outlander. Outlander is only entertaining but not much else. The series is shallow, character development is weak, historical aspects are questionable and there are some aspects of the sex scenes that border on pornographic. Despite all it's weaknesses the series is still entertaining enough to watch 7/8.",1513814400,,1070,4.911602209944752

6520735,1,B00M0GMC26,"Horrible stuff.  So obviously the producers emphasize extreme sex scenes, including repeated violent rapes, and push the limits on violence causing me to think 1., they didn't think their capability of producing a great series based on a good storyline was good enough without it or, 2. they see the viewing public as below base level ignorants who believe the more vicious cruelty and violent sex, the better the show.  Unfortunately from the look of the high ratings it appears #2 is a big factor.
Where are we at in humanity that so many of us love to be entertained by cruelty and torture? I am not strongly religious or prudish either, having gone through the late sixties free love (and peaceful) era.

I was amazed and pleased after reading the books that the actors cast as Claire and Jamie were almost exactly as I'd pictured them in my head. Caitriona Balfe is perfectly cast as the lovely and fierce but kind and beautiful Claire, and Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser makes my heart stop. All the actors are superb -- I especially love Graham McTavish as Dougal Mackenzie (I find him almost as sexy as Jamie!), and Stephen Walters as Angus Mhor is so crude and fierce and funny. Be warned though, this series is NOT for kids -- not only are the sex scenes frequent and fairly graphic, but there is a lot of violence, with very realistic blood and guts.

I wish the TV writers would pay more attention to the humor that the books contain. Diana Galbadon has a wonderful sense of humor and when I read the books I found myself laughing aloud many times. Where is the funny side of Jamie that we see in the books? The tv series has a tendency to dwell on the dark side and forget that Jamie has quite a comic vein. Also, what about diversifying the sound track? Every time somebody is making love there is this somber funereal music. What's up with the death song when they are having hot sex?The Season 3 (Voyager) had to cut too many good scenes of the book to fit in such short season. I wish it were as long as season 1, so we could  enjoy all the best of what the book offered. On season 3 Claire sounds a little bit unreasonable and stiff, but Jamie compensates with his amazing acting and looks (with the exception of the one part when he sees Brianna's photos and he is kind of unemotional, but I guess it is the spirit of The times and of Scotland).",1512345600,,1168,4.118421052631579

6521178,2,B00M0GMC26,I watched most of the first season because it seems every magazine was obsessed with it. The first few episodes were interesting but after that it seemed to just be titillating with no real depth. If you want the television equivalent of a harlequin novel this is it.,1508284800,,267,4.583333333333333
6521179,5,B00M0GMC26,To Who am I. You need to watch more than the first season. Maybe read the books. Claire is anything but a victim. You watch a few episodes and then write a bad review spewing the typical carp. I am a woman and I don't think she was a victim. She is much smarter than that. Keep watching. And Jamie is more man than 99% of those today. As Claire is more woman.,1508112000,,359,3.9315068493150687
6521180,2,B00M0GMC26,"Take a doormat and try to make her 'seem' strong by giving her a few curse words to say and some moral judgements to spew and there you have the typical Romance Novel Heroine... Add in some men who are both good and bad (like most people) but who treat her poorly and she chooses to only see the good side anyway as she willingly subjects herself to prove how ""good"" she is to the reader and there you have your typical Romance Novel.

I'm struggling with how to rate this since the acting of many of the actors is quite good and the script seems to be ok.  The heroine Claire is unfortunately pretty two-dimentional and flat, but the other characters are much richer.  I Really like the medical aspect of it and watching her take action on wounds, but when it's missing it becomes ridiculous and boring for me.

One of the things that I HATE about this genre is that it often makes women play subordinate door-mat stereotypes while trying to disguise it as a strong female.  If you want some examples of this I'll post a couple of spoilers below.  But this genre tends to make it ok for women to stand up for themselves UNTIL it makes them seem less soft-hearted and so called 'feminine'.  That's the line they can't cross before they're required to be door-mats because somehow being a soft hearted female prisoner is better than being FREE.  Reminds me of the old view that a woman with a philandering husband would be lauded a heroine saint if she sucked it up, smiled, didn't fool around herself and cleaned her husband's socks anyway.  Because you know- that was the 'ladylike' thing to do.  And a woman who stood up for herself and chose her own freedom was immoral.

Claire is sexually harrassed, berated and imprisoned but she still finds it in her heart to stick up for her prisoners like a good little stockholm victim.  And no I'm not talking about the parts where she's just trying to gain trust to escape because unfortunately, most of the time that's not what she's doing.

(Spoilers ahead)

1) When Claire tries to escape during the ambush, Jaime gives her the choice of walking back or threatens to throw her over his shoulder and carry her.  Then the next day they are best buddies!  Why has she forgotten this man kidnapped her?  Is it because he's muscular and handsome?  Because as this genre constantly reminds us, when you're a woman freedom takes a back seat when the person kidnapping you is hot.

2) When Dougal throws Claire the shirt he just tore for Claire to sew up like a nice girl, she throws it back at him and tells him to sew them himself. I was impressed.  But then Dougal just  'knows' that women are willing to subject themselves to humiliation the moment they feel a little pity for a poor grown adult male without a shirt to wear, right? So he simply shrugs and says, fiine, he'll just wear rags then.  And this of course completely shatters our heroine.  So she pouts and crawls over to get the shirt to sew it. Ugh.  Cringe-worthy.  The only people in that scene who came off as strong were Dougal who got her to pick it up from the floor to sew it obediently and Jaime- who finally tore the shirt from her hands and said he'd be a grown up and sew it himself.

3) One of her 'shadows' sticks a knife in Claire's face when she refuses to eat stolen food and he tells her he will not be judged by a ""whore"" like her. Barely a few hours later Claire is smiling at this man and finding him charming.  What??  Who cares if he had good reasons to steal the food or not?  The man insulted you while sticking a knife in your face- HE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

4)  When Claire is finally found by a band of British soldiers she is asked straight out whether she is there against her will.  At this moment, Dougal feels pretty confident that his obedient little doormat is going to have his back - despite the fact that he's sexually assaulted her, kept her from leaving the Castle, and continues to threaten daily.  You can tell because Dougal literally tells the officers there that the lady is none of their business and only his business and when the officers INSIST on getting an answer from Claire herself, Dougal actually looks back at Claire as if he's only slightly questioning whether or not she's actually going to defend him.  I mean, the fact that he looked back at her at all shows just how used to having the doormat he was.  He wasn't in the least bit surprised when she defended him and claimed she was there of her own free will!  God forbid she would tell the truth and have herself rescued because then our heroine wouldn't show her empathetic heart and we can't have that!

 I could keep going, but this is already enough and YES-  I know it's not this simple.  I know that Jaime is mostly a good guy and she could see that yada, yada, yada-  but the fact remains that he kidnapped her and did not go out of his way to help her escape.  And yes, she does need to act nicey nicey with her captors to gain their trust, but there are many times she is NOT doing it as an act to gain their trust such as in the examples above.  I just hope that girls under a certain age aren't watching this drivel because its partly stuff like this that makes them grow up thinking it's normal to be in a relationship with someone who intentionally hurts you.",1508112000,,5289,4.354081632653061

The combination of 'time-travel,' magickal beliefs & daily knowledge of life described regarding Scottish/English historical facts are what allows one's imagination to feel quite personally about the characters. It's also extremely 'spot-on' understanding how history continues to repeat itself & mankind is still foolish enough to continue making the same mistakes--such as the need for human cruelty & war's brutality. This series transcends literally all eras, not merely the past but sadly now, in our present-day world.

6521286,5,B00M0GMC26,"Addicting swashbuckling historical romance. Contains sex scenes, violence, and partial nudity. I think of it as R rated. Not for small children. Somewhere in the series ( I can't remember if it was 1 volume a or 1 volume 2) there was a plot twist that delighted me for days. I didn't see it coming and it was quite clever. Kudos to the writers!",1506211200,,344,4.390625
6521297,5,B00M0GMC26,"Love, hope this show is never dropped from starz/amazon prime. Been a fan of the books, read ever one of them 2x or more, since they first came out. Casting of actors, producers in the series is very nicely done!",1506124800,,212,4.325

6521299,4,B00M0GMC26,"This TV series is doing a far better job with the story than the writer of the books could ever do. While not flawless (some of the dialogue is either not developed enough, or overly dramataic), it's pretty enjoyable.",1506124800,,217,4.589743589743589

6521302,2,B00M0GMC26,"At first, this series is pretty good: well acted, good storyline, beautiful landscape. But after a couple of episodes, the quality goes downhill. The acting is still good, no problem with that. Costumes, landscape, photography: all is fine. Unfortunately, too much of the story revolves around all male characters behind sexually attracted to the main female character. A lot of scenes, especially when she is alone with a male character, are way too long and could easily be cut in half. All after a while, it feels that the entire suspens revolves around one question: is this woman going to get raped or not? All in all, I find this series very disappointing and I regret having spent more than $10 to watch the first season. I won't pay for season 2.",1505952000,,754,4.71969696969697

After watching one season I was hooked and binge-read the first 6 outlander books. I am now re-watching and love it even more!!! They are so true to the books and the only changes made are for the better!

Love the characters and the actors they chose to play them are just perfect. I really hope they get to make the entire book series into shows!!!",1505779200,,462,4.310344827586207

6521306,1,B00M0GMC26,"We watched the first episode of this series and thought the producer was using a formula -- include plenty of nudity, blood and guts and you'll get high ratings. So we thought, we'll watch one more and decide whether to continue. We turned the tv off when the first rape scene showed up. If you've ever wondered where people get the idea we're living in a ""rape"" culture, shows like this are exhibit A. We won't be watching the rest of the series.",1505692800,,447,4.397590361445783

6521341,1,B00M0GMC26,I tried to like this show and I probably could have if it hadn't fallen off the rails as a love story thriller and into the gutter.  Good grief!  SO MUCH PORN followed by sadistic porn.  I started skipping every ten seconds to see if they would go back to the storyline but it just spiraled down into out right sadistic porn which left me feeling like a fool to have stayed with it for so long.,1505347200,10,394,4.090909090909091

6521404,5,B00M0GMC26,"A faithful rendering of Diana Gabaldon's book Outlander (which I have loved since it was released in the 1990s). Ron Moore took great care to keep to the spirit of the book and it's story line. It is filmed in Scotland and the cast is mostly Scottish and become the inner eye's version of the roles they play (even if you pictured them differently from the book). Cait and Sam's chemistry is through the roof and they ARE Claire and Jamie to a T. Casting was spot on! The landscape is amazing and evocative - it too tells the story. Terry D did miracles with the wardrobe and went a long way to transporting the viewers to the time periods in the story. The music gets into your soul and thrills you. Great care was made to ensure that it was everything it should and could be. Every contributer outperformed - can you give an award to the entire crew, cast and country? It is : Consuming. Haunting. Evocative. Captivating. Moving. Transporting. Don't miss it!",1503100800,,960,4.491428571428571

6521420,3,B00M0GMC26,"The show is watchable, even entertaining, as long as you:
1. Have at least some interest in Scottish history
2. Have close captioning on your TV
3. Are willing to learn some Scottish words like ""ken,"" ""bairn,"" ""bonny,"" etc.

I strongly recommend that you DO NOT watch the last episode and go directly to Season 2, unless you enjoy a drawn-out sadistic and graphic man-rape. There is absolutely no need for that, other than to show the producers' disdain for the viewers. You would not miss a thing, other than some flashbacks in Season 2.

Also, I did not appreciate another example of the current Hollywood infatuation with all things pagan, while portraying the established clergy as ignorant evildoers. FYI, the second season is better.",1502323200,,739,4.904

6521425,5,B00M0GMC26,"When a TV series is attempted from books, it often falls short, but OUTLANDER is riveting. First and foremost, the casting here is impressive and well done. Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan had very big shoes to fill for Jamie and Claire, and are astonishing in these roles. I couldn't picture Jamie Fraser played by anyone other than Sam Heughan and if I didn't know better, I'd think Diana (the author) made him. Balfe's keen intelligence shines as Claire, and both of these lead actors' range is well utilized in the series. The series begins in Scotland, and this is historical fiction with a time travel twist. The show was filmed on location using a great number of actors from the locales featured in the storyline. The accents are highly accurate for those who demand authenticity, as are the costumes. The show has a fair amount of grit, too, portrayed in a stark and believable manner, and some scenes are definitely not for the sensitive or fainthearted. This show is so good, it has boosted tourism to Scotland.",1501891200,,1022,4.747191011235955

6521521,1,B00M0GMC26,"Season 1 is just a drudge.  I only kept watching because I was sick and too lazy to find something else.  The script is horrid as is the narration (and why did Jamie just start well into season 1?).  This is a very simple plot/concept and you don't need narration at ALL.  It just is filmed like a pulp novel.  This is taken from romance novels, so things are going to be pretty simple, with apologies to romance enthusiasts.  I am just not one, but I did try to read the first book in this series as it seemed like it might be more than the usual romance novel, but I couldn't get into it at all.  The acting is mostly histrionic.  And the characters, esp Claire and Jamie, are their own very worst enemies.  Every time they set out without their brains, I just roll my eyes.  Not great as a plot mover!  Claire is a stubborn, high strung woman with no common sense or emotional control, and I could not like or respect her. Jamie is a sympathetic character (and this needs one so badly!!) but he is the perfect lover, which is a huge fantasy.  I kept mouthing, ""Oh come ON."". But who wants reality, I guess?  The villains and what they do is over the top gross and not necessary (and yet again, the homosexual/bi character is the evil one, alas).  The direction is very lacking as is the lighting.  And too many side trips into 'educational' things, but they really weren't of much use.  Not like the way Michael Creighton used that device, for example.  I am an American, but got to live in Scotland in the mid 70s (Dundee), and I went to all these places often.  I thought I'd love the locations in the series, and it is nice to hear them mentioned, but it has so little to do with anything other than just a location name, so I'm not moved at all.  I just love Ft. William!  Spent great times at wonderful B&Bs and sitting out by Loch Ness in the early morning.  Too bad the series doesn't mention the very important locks and where Ft. William is situated in relation to Loch Ness (which is heavenly gorgeous; forget Nessie!).  Doesn't give any reference for really any locations.  Skip this one unless you are a die hard fan of the books, and even then no guarantee you'll like it.  Can't believe the good ratings.",1497052800,8,2221,4.322033898305085

I would have stopped watching, but the rest of the cast is very engaging, and the story is great.  It is impossible to sympathize with the main character because she is so bitter and mean.  She plays the role with a chip on her shoulder the entire time, and it is impossible to believe that any man would be even remotely interested in such a woman.  It does not matter that she is pretty.  She just is not at all engaging.  I am not sure if this is the fault of the actress or the director or both.  I only wish that when they were editing prior to putting out the final version, someone in power would have seen how hostile and despicable the character came off, and had demanded that every scene be re-shot so that the main character would be someone we could identify with, and not hate.

6521531,5,B00M0GMC26,A wonderful book series brought to life in film.,1495929600,,48,4.444444444444445
6521532,2,B00M0GMC26,"I've read this book series probably a dozen times or more in the last two decades, and I love these books (even the squicky parts,) because they're telling a story.  There's a distinct narrative. I've met Diana Gabaldon, have autographed books, the lot.  Believe me, I'm a fan and can quote certain parts of the books verbatim.

But I hate this show.  The acting is amazing, the scenery is stunning, so I'll give it two stars for that; but past that?  Even if it weren't a book series first, this show is not likeable for me.

It's not because of the usual mish-mash of arguments I've seen people make, i.e. ""Claire is too tall!  Her eyes aren't the right colour!""  ""Jamie's hair looks Hobbit-y!  He's not got the right nose!"" etc.  No, my distaste comes from a deeper place than that.  I could care less how they look, I care about the story.  And equally importantly, the characters.

We'll start with Claire, the protagonist.  What made this series so amazing for me is that Claire is a strong, well-travelled, well-read and inviting character.  She's got her issues; family ""abandonment"" (her parents died when she was a child), PTSD from serving as a war nurse, and of course the absolutely bewildering cognitive dissonance of having time-travelled into the past.  In the show, her strength and her sense of self were eradicated.  She became a soft-core porno heroine, rather than the liberated and powerful woman she was in the books.  I was not impressed with the way the writers chose to morph her character into something more approaching the pop-culture norm of a weak woman.  I was especially disgusted when Claire, in direct contrast to the book, chose to pretend to be a witch to satisfy a young girl's desire for a love potion.  Claire would never have done that, out of the very real fear she would have been prosecuted for it and she was held in a massively suspicious light already due to being English.  I'm very forgiving and tolerant of changes in a story when switching from a book-to-screen medium due to the constraints versus the freedoms of each, but changes in a character's core personality are not forgivable.  This continued to be my complaint with pretty much every character.

Next we'll talk about Jamie.  He's closer than Claire in his character, but he still acts out of character as established over 15 books and counting (yes, I'm including the Outlandish Companion and the Lord John books, as well as the forgettable graphic novel), as well as a number of novellas.  I'm trying not to give spoilers, so I won't go into details.  Let's just say the last damned thing he'd do is actually join The Black Watch.

Okay, so Dougal.  Okay, he's a complicated character (aren't they all?) and he has an interesting relationship with Jamie.  But oddly enough, he does love his nephew, and he's certainly not a rapist nor would his personal honour permit him to tell Claire he wants to ""grind her corn.""  While he does make advances at Claire twice, he's not that gritty.  He's an opportunist and a patriot, as well as infallibly loyal to his brother and his clan, but he's not this slightly monstrous somewhat sociopathic evilish guy.

Geilis Duncan.  Oh, what a character she is.  And again, complex.  But the writers chose to stage her as a pretty shallow, sweet-voiced ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" which isn't at all accurate to the character.  She's pretty bawdy, and very forthright.  She isn't hiding behind a sweet smile (unless she's playing with her husband) she's facing life head-on.

Murtagh and Rupert are changed from rough and tumble, loyal, intelligent, and somewhat bawdy friends into buffoons and comic relief.

And Jenny.  Oh, man.  Really, Starz?  Jenny is portrayed as this sharp-tongued harridan with zero empathy and zero compassion, when it's so exactly the opposite.  You took a loving, blunt, truthful and honest woman with a heart of gold and turned her into a nasty, unlikeable caricature of herself.  She certainly never called Claire a ""trollop"".... quite the opposite, she was very respectful even while in a knock-down-drag-out Fraser cat fight with her brother.  She was downright malicious in the show's portrayal rather than the loving woman with a very Scottish, motherly way of putting her foot down (which makes sense, since she became ""woman of the house"" at nine years old.  I'm appalled at what was done to her.

And then we'll go into the filming.  Look, many of the sex scenes are definitely in the book, but they're hardly gratuitous.  In fact, quite the opposite.  On Diana's Facebook page a year or two back, she posted a short essay she'd written on the art of writing sex scenes and something she was quite clear on was that ""less is more.""  Yes, they have frequent sex, but it's ""off-screen"" as it were, with Jamie making a suggestion or raising a brow, Claire responding, a few subtle references and then fade to black.  An example from the first book is Jamie telling Claire that they'll likely be ""sleeping in haystacks"" and then nodding at a patch of bracken and suggesting they try it, to ""get into practice.""  The book then cuts to the aftermath.  Then they do play again, but never is it said what exactly they're doing.  No ""throbbing manhoods"" here!  In fact, Diana raises the question of overly-purple sex scenes in a book later in the series and makes it quite clear how ridiculous she finds play-by-play sex scenes.  The show could have kept it tasteful.  I'm far from a prude, and I'm absolutely cool with sex and sexuality; I raised my kids to understand that sex is natural, beautiful, and part of life and absolutely not a sin in any way unless someone is not consenting.  And yet, I found myself turned off by the graphic sex.  The frequent, frequent graphic sex.  This is screen time that could be spent on character development, not gratuitous and unnecessary frequent depictions that ""they're banging.... again...""  ""Oh, look!  Breasts!  Again!""  And hey, I'm all for Free the Nipple.  I'd loooove to see Westerners stop finding female breasts so sexualised, and I'd love to be able to walk around topless like guys do with just as much... or rather, as little reaction or care.  However, they're hyper-sexualised in the show, and therefore are creating the opposite cultural thoughts.

And, finally: yep, the violence.  I do find it amusing that many reviewers are complaining about the sex without a word against the violence, when really I think depictions of love-making should be far preferable to depictions of violence.  However, while some violence needs to be depicted in order to get a point across, build a character, or make it clear that this is unacceptable behaviour, much of the violence in the first season was also gratuitous.  Again, that time could be spent building the character and their relationships with each other as a *result* of the violence, showing the healing as the books did in such beautifully written prose, instead of spending time almost lovingly depicting every gory graphic act possible with scant moments spent on the healing.  Yes, it was a brutal time period.  Yes, people got raped.  Yes, people got flogged.  However, they did what WE should be doing with our TV shows; making it clear that this is unacceptable, and then getting on with the healing.

Soooo.... basically what it comes down to for me, is that everything I liked about the characters got pretty much reversed in the series, and everything I liked about the story; same thing.

I'm glad many people and fans of the books like this series, but I'm going to be the dissenter; it does not work for me at all.",1495843200,,7610,4.786482334869432

Season 2 was cut to 13 weeks and is a much bigger book so they had to cut extra things out. I
think they added the offending scenes to get some people to watch it. The books are more PG
rated and not so in your face as a TV show is. I like the actor chosen to play Jamie, but not so
much the one chosen to play Claire. I realize they got to two weeks before the start of filming and
had not found a Claire, but surely there was one in the mix who fit the description of Claire even
a little better. She is ok, but definitely not my choice. The story is great even with a few additions
and subtractions by Ron Moore. There are a few things I would have used from the book that are
not used, but I realize they were working with time limits. How they will do in future books I do not

Definitely not a program for children under 16, but if you've read the books--actulally, even if you haven't--you will thoroughly enjoy Outlander.",1488931200,,552,5.284090909090909

6521674,1,B00M0GMC26,"Just because it includes controversial themes and not seen on TV before (nursing mother expelling breast milk manually) doesn't make it a good show.  It is excessively violent and shows way too much explicit sex for a TV show.  I was tempted to quit it after the first half but plodded on to the second half of the first season and will see no more.  This is just an overly explicit romance novel put to film.  I actually think it soft porn with too much nudity!  Also, I am all for breast feeding but in our world breasts are still viewed by men as sexual objects and should be done in public discreetly.

I'm an R.N (like Claire!) and I've always enjoyed the concept of time travel, so needless to say I fell instantly in love! When I learned Starz was developing the entire series for television I was thrilled. They've kept closely enough to the source material to please me, and any changes they've made have actually enhanced the storyline, which I wouldn't have believed possible. The casting is perfect and beyond expectations, bringing beloved characters to life. The costuming is sumptuous. The settings are as magical and beautiful as I imagined in my mind's eye.

It's borderline X in my opinion - I was a bit uncomfortable throughout many scenes.  Of course I watched it anyway because ya know - ya gotta because it's such a great story line!  :)  The actors they chose to portray the characters were no where near what I had in my head.

6521931,5,B00M0GMC26,"I just recently started watching this series and my first thought was this is a woman's program.  It dragged a bit as the plot developed but my patience was rewarded by a nude scene in which Caitriona Balfe, the lead actress, who played Claire Randall gave the audience extended views of her beautiful breasts. Of course, there are many handsome men in the series to keep the women interested. I am now in the middle of Season 2 and Caitriona has bared her breasts in almost all the episodes, all instances being very tastefully done.

The series is purely fictional, but considerable effort was obviously given to some historical accuracy.  The wardrobes, speech, grooming, events of the time all appear to be what you would expect in Scotland of 1743.  Claire Randall is English and is forced to adapt as an outsider into 18th century Scotland during a period of high tension between the Scotts and occupying English forces.

I am almost done with Season 2 and will be lost when it is over.  Fortunately, Starz has renewed the series for a third season which is scheduled to start in early April 2017.",1486166400,4,1103,4.689119170984456

I love Claire's flashbacks to moments of history lessons from Frank right when they are needed most. I adore the action, romance and carefully woven historical reference in this show. And with all that, it still manages to have many moments of wit and physical humor.

I have to say that it matched up well with the story and there are very few inconsistencies.  One is particular was actually addressed in the ""making of"" extras at the end of the episode and was done to give the readers just a slight variation so they didn't constantly know what was coming.

6522056,5,B00M0GMC26,"Often if you've read the book (or books in this case as there are 8 so far in the Outlander series) the film, and especially a TV series, doesn't come close to meeting your expectations. In this case, I've enjoyed the TV series MORE than I enjoyed the books and I NEVER thought I could or would possibly say that. In fact I've recently gone back and started re-reading the Outlander series (for the THIRD time - to kill the time during DROUGHTLANDER!) and I find myself saying ""the TV series handled that plot line much better"". What I love most about the Outlander book series are the characters, Claire and Jamie primarily but also Brianna and Roger and many of the other characters. Diana Gabaldon developed characters that you either love or love to hate and a storyline that, while unbelievable at times, is simply addicting. I own all 8 books and the entire video series that is out so far (even though I've recorded every episode as I'm afraid I'll accidentally erase them). So, buy and read every book in the series and then watch every episode that has been made. Hopefully by then Season 3 will be here!",1485820800,2,1113,4.54228855721393

I LOVE the Outlander books, so I considered NOT watching the show. I finally decided to have a look-see at the first episode, & fell in love with Outlander all over again!
I am a huge fan of time travel stories which is what led me to the Outlander Series. Contrary to some others opinions...traveling back 200 years through the stones does indeed a time travel story make!
Yes there is some violence (just as I am sure there WAS violence in that time) And yes there is some sex (hasn't there always been sex?)  but it is NOT porn.
I feel the show follows the book very well, & I hope the entire series of books end up on dvd!!",1485302400,5,710,4.371212121212121

6522270,3,B00M0GMC26,"Season 1 was spectacular. My only complaint is that they spoke Gaelic so much and there were no subtitles. I get that when Claire was around, the filmmakers wanted you to feel as lost and left out as Claire. However, there's an entire scene between Jamie and Murtogh that is completely in Gaelic and I'm sitting there wondering why I'm even watching it - why did they waste time on a scene that barely anyone will understand?

But that of course is minor. The rest is just fabulous. Great acting, story, cinematography, character development...everything.

Having said that, Season 2 did not utilize Gaelic as much -  it was just sprinkled in the conversation in between English and when they speak French, there are subtitles.

But S2 was not as good. The actors and crew are still stellar but there is no character development. They don't seem to have a real goal that progresses - the plot seems to be just a red herring and is not substantial or life or death as in S1.

I've never read the books and I'm told each season is one book so if you liked the book I guess you'll like the season. If you're like me and coming in blindly you might be disappointed.

I devoured S1 and this one I have 3 more episodes to go in S2 but I'm not in a rush.",1485129600,,1247,4.353448275862069

6522306,3,B00M0GMC26,"No adaptation can live up to the power of the human imagination and this one is no exception. The essential story is there and the author tells us she is satisfied. Chief among my problems with the series is the actor playing Jamie. His hair is auburn, not the glowing golden red described in the book. He is big but not head and shoulders above the rest of the cast and I would not describe him as strikingly handsome or heavily muscled. Were not so much emphasis put on these points in the book it would not seem so significant.

I cannot comment on the authenticity of the tartans and so many scenes are so dark one can hardly tell. Must check to see where it was shot and what building is used as Loech Castleit certainly is an oppressive looking heap.

After the awkwardness of the initial episode and its inventions the series becomes more true to the novel upon which it is based and grows on one.

This is another series in which greedy studios have split a season into two parts and part one ends with Claire in the clutches of the villainous Captain Randall just as Jamie appears inside the armed British Camp to rescue her.",1485129600,,1134,4.390476190476191
6522307,5,B00M0GMC26,"LOVED Season One of Outlander. It follows the books so very VERY closely. Few shows can do that well. In fact, Game of Thrones did the same thing for Season 1 and then they went their very separate ways.

Claire and Jamie are a funny darling pair. Scotland is magical. There are some very gory scenes but they are done well. The characters have great chemistry and come to life beautifully. The soundtrack is like no other.

Absolutely LOVED it and ordered Season 2 right away",1485129600,,476,4.523255813953488

6522309,5,B00M0GMC26,"After trying twice to get into this show (Scotland has a way of pulling me into a story), the third try did the trick.
A little caveat, though: I've never read the books. As a guy, romance isn't my genre branch. And yet, this show grabbed me with its period piece, its culture, its interesting style of story.
Oh, man, the story is incredible! Whether you're in it for the sex scenes, for the language, for the violence, just know it's not in an equal ratio of per episode. I'm glad for the unpredictable element of adult content. That separates it from the typical premium network show these days. The story, though, has a historical quality that keeps drawing me in by episode's end. Never disappointed if there's no sex or violence, I just keep loving the Scottish atmosphere, the unique aspect of no subtitles when one speaks Gaelic, the critical subtext of each scenario, the deep characterization, even the Scottish Highlands politics.
For my third try, this has become my newest Starz addiction.
Kinda makes me proud to call myself a Sassenach.",1485043200,,1051,4.748633879781421

I think it feeds into the new generation of girls who look for rich Men to whisk them away. They don't want to admit it but deep ingrained in their consciousness it's there. With Outlander it's the closest portrayal of LOVE and PASSION you can get out there! I have read almost all books in the Outlander Series. I have always loved history, I have Scottish roots and I am married to my soulmate so I find the connection with Claire and Jamie relatable. The author of the Outlander series is a total genius and you can truly tell how hard she works to keep facts straight.

Every department who creates this show is at the top of their game. Heughan and Balfe are Tracy and Hepburn. Menzies and Balfe are Grant and Hepburn.

The story is sloppy--could be tightened tremendously and lead to a point rather than aimlessly meandering from one violent point to the next.  Do not waste your time and emotion on this series.  The entire series 1 could be handle in a single 60 minute episode by a skilled film maker.  I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, DO NOT recommend this series.",1483660800,4,489,4.773809523809524

I have read all the books and this series stays very true to the books.  There are some variations, but so far they have been OK.  The story is fascinating.  Because there is time travel involved, it might be considered SiFi, but I consider the story much more historical.  The author of the books has done meticulous research and the story portrays and very vivid image of Scotland in the mid 18th century. All the books and the series revolve around two main characters, Claire and Jamie Fraser.  They will be included along with the iconic literary couples of all time.",1483660800,,720,4.442748091603053

There's some great potential, but the theme is about raping the main characters and degrading them. This really is truly nasty. I can't fathom how this became popular. I wonder, occasionally, if the people enjoying this show have never experienced violent crime themselves? This is not entertainment, this is about folks enjoying the grotesque. I guess? I can't fathom it. This isn't great story.  (Main gal actually says something about how she and her husband are having relationship troubles, but at least they'll always have sex. - I about cracked up laughing at the shallow aspect and how this is the most untrue concept about relationships I ever heard.)  Gal blames herself after she gets raped. I can't even with this. The scenery is gorgeous. I'm glad folks are employed.

I had been interested in the show for a while, because the advertisements looked great, and im so glad that I decided to watch it. The detail, acting, sets, costumes all transport you back to the 18th century and tell the tale like your right there with the actors within the story. I loved it so much that I literally binge watched the first 3 seasons within 3 to 4 days. I have now re-watched certain episodes, researched the books, and started on book 6 to see what happens next. I am anxiously looking forward to season 2.5 to begin ( the season aren't numbered 1, 2, 3.. but instead, 1, 1.5, and 2.) I found myself in love with Jamie, and wishing for a husband just like him. I also loved the friend and loyalty exhibited by Martaugh, and the strength of Claire. Although I felt that Claire is a bit hardheaded, she is a strong female lead.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves historic, cinematic pieces and movies set in specific periods with great stories of romance, action, and intrigue.",1482710400,2,1133,4.473429951690822

I wanted to make sure there was more of this to watch after I binged the first two seasons. It's a great story. The fact that the main characters are both gorgeous doesn't hurt its cause either.

6523276,4,B00M0GMC26,"Claire Randall is holidaying in Scotland, looking to reconnect with her husband following their service in WW2. However, while exploring an ancient stone monument she is transported back to 1743. Here she is quickly caught up in the intrigues between the Scottish clans and the British army. In some ways she is fortunate to fall in with the McKenzie clan, particularly the handsome Jamie Fraser. Conversely she faces terrible perils at the hands of Captain Randall, her own husbands ancestor.

Of all the story types, time-travel is one of the hardest to pull off successfully. There are so many issues regarding language and general credibility. Here, Claire is not as canny as youd imagine and seems to complicate her dealings more than youd expect. Indeed, Im not sure if shes a 1940s girl or a 21st century one? Maybe its just the scripting but you don't want to stretch believability further than you have to. Anyway, Claire has to use her slim knowledge of the times and the Randall family deftly.

This said, paradoxes aside, there are also some very interesting angles explored and some amusing exchanges. Note though, that it is foremost a drama and there are many very serious doings. The 1740s were a rough and ready time and there is plenty of violence and sex, including the mixing of the two (teenagers would say its quite rapey). An absolute highlight is the scrumptous sets and costuming. I personally have long been intrigued by the Scottish Highlands and its history and this series is a great way to see it all.

This said, the accents are hard to follow accents at times. Given there are eight episodes in this first volume, its also a little slow. Bear in mind too, that almost everything is seen from Claires perspective, so this has some limitations in conveying the story. In the end there was too much explicit violence for my wife but not quite enough action for me. Overall though, I feel this show would appeal most to younger women who have been introduced to stronger topics in GOT etc but with the themes here being more in tune with a womans areas of interests. 4 stars",1482105600,,2102,4.722070844686648

It's really only the first half of the first book - only 8 episodes and I'm debating whether I want to spend another $20+ dollars for the other half.  Given that I'm still debating - it probably says I won't.  Good but not worth an investment of more money.

6523620,5,B00M0GMC26,"I rarely enjoy when books are made into a movie/tv series. The actors are often not what I envisioned the characters from the book to look/sound like, particular events are omitted or altered in a way that make them hardly recognizable. I have read the entire Outlander books series (twice) so I was more than hesitant to view the tv series. I finally broke down one evening and began to watch...and I was absolutely amazed at how wonderful the tv series is. The characters are true, the story line stays in tact and certain scenes are spot on. The love/sex scenes have been included in the tv series, and though there is nudity, I did not find any of the scenes offensive and thought they were perfect. I have found the actors that have created Jamie and Claire's characters to be truly absorbed into their roles; you can feel their respect and love for each other. One would think they have an off screen relationship. I suppose if you had not read the book series yet, the storyline could drag on a bit, perhaps losing your interest. I recommend you read the books first, if you have not. If you are putting off watching the tv series, put if off no more. You will be consumed by the tv series as you were consumed by the books.",1481068800,2,1231,4.427312775330397

Um....one suggestion though: If your TV is visible to anyone walking their dog along your street, you may want to close your drapes/shades. The sex scenes are pretty sexy...and nudie...and well.......Just don't have the kids around for this one. Otherwise a really nice show.

Yes, this is on American premium cable, so it obviously contains nudity, sex, and violence, as do all premium cable shows. I feel that everything they do has a purpose. The sex scenes give us insight into the evolving relationship and intimacy of the main couple. The violence reflects the reality of the time period. Don't write this show off because of nudity, even if you're prudish. It has excellent actors, beautiful costumes and sets, and most importantly, good writing. It starts off slowly for the first couple episodes, but the story expands at just the right pace and you will fall in love with Claire and Jamie.",1480636800,7,708,4.957983193277311

6523920,1,B00M0GMC26,"I have never written a review; however,  I feel compelled to do so after watching Outlander Season 1 (includes volumes 1 and 2) which covers the first book in the Outlander book series, by Dianna Gabaldon. I read the first book in the series four years ago and was very excited to learn that the story was unfolding as a TV series I remember loving the romance between Jamie and Claire, but I also recall being greatly disturbed by the Wentworth Prison scene. I was so angry that the author CHOSE to write that scene. She didn't need to make the villain that heinous. Nor did she need to make the hero suffer so greatly. So, with that said I began the TV series so excited to watch a sweet romance, and nervous about how the Wentworth Prison scene would be portrayed. The only positive comment I can share is that the acting was well done. Unfortunately, any decent aspects of the season were overshadowed by a lot of drama and boring episodes where nothing seemed to really move forward. The Jamie and Claire dynamic doesn't take up enough screen time. The nudity is abundant , offensive, and unnecessary (spent a lot of time fast-forwarding or looking away). Lastly, the Wentworth Prison scene was sickening. The scene in the book is bad enough, but the TV series seemed to want to bask in the filthy nature of the scene and force us to see it over and over again. During the time that I was watching the series, I was also beginning to read the series to completion. Last night upon completing the first season of the series I  was reminded of how disgusting the author makes Jack Randall. I was 54% into Book 1 and quit. I will NOT finish the books and I will NOT finish the TV series. This is a story that had potential, but went in such a vile direction that I can't proceed. I wish there had been a review for me to read that would have warned me of what was to come, and I hope that this helps anyone who wants to avoid investing their time and money into a story that is so deplorable.",1479168000,4,1994,4.343163538873995

So we decided to watch it when we got back...and we are enjoying it thoroughly. Having been there, seeing the ""stones"", and the historic areas depicted in the series, makes it even more realistic and meaningful. The acting is great, and of course the scenery brings back our memories of this gorgeous part of the Earth. We toured with Road Scholar ""In the Heart of the Scottish Highlands"" tour.

6525260,4,B00M0GMC26,I enjoyed purchasing a few episodes in season one that I missed (when I had a free pay-channel weekend and recorded most of the series). The price was a just a little too much per episode so I didn't buy the last 2 episodes I missed. I don't have Netflix but use Amazon Prime for movies. Sometimes my friends or family will talk about something available on Netflx and it's not always affordable on Amazon Prime.

Season One is incredible from the scenery, costumes, and casting, everything just works. I really like how the time travel is not a central part of the plot just an incidental occurrence so that the show is not overly sci-fi and is more period drama. I highly recommend this show and just know if you start watching you will be addicted.",1475971200,,510,4.378947368421053

6525566,1,B00M0GMC26,"Unbeknownst to me was that the BluRay DVD comes from Price Clock in the U.K & Canada - it may not work in your BluRay player.
Once before I ordered a DVD (different movie, different company) and it came from the U.K. And it would not play but just attempt to read and read. And yes, I know the rule of BluRay DVD needs a BluRay player. I was right, The Outlander discs would only read and read and not play.
When the Outlander DVD took so long to deliver, I called Amazon and learned that it was coming from the U.K.  When I heard that I was concerned I would have the same experience as a few years ago but stellar, Price Clock - assured that it ""works in all regions"" and that ""all players need the firmware updated"".  I have an expensive NEW BluRay player, no updating of anything needed.  I was instructed to play it,....when I did open the pkg and found that it needed to be returned - AT THAT TIME I was told by the seller there is a 45% restocking fee.
The buyers should be made aware by Amazon that The DVD was coming from out of the USA and the HIGH restocking fee, and that there are not tracking of the product - this should be in the product description. Neither were included.
I filed an A-Z form and Amazon denied it.
I've been a loyal and happy customer for years - UNTIL NOW. Look at the reviews - others have had similar experiences
Amazon has faiked me.

****Update:  I am happy to say that the problem has been resolved BY Amazon, not the seller - keep this in mind. Also, beware of products from outside the US.",1475712000,8,1531,4.176271186440678

The show seemed a little slow to get started--partially because of its relatively complex setting and plot. But it does develop as the characters become better defined and we learn about their back stories, and a viewer is likely to be hooked by the 3rd or 4th episode.

6525617,1,B00M0GMC26,"Believe me when I say I'm not easily offended and love a good mixture of action, adventure, and violence. BUT the number of RAPE scenes are tremendously disturbing.

I'm not sure if the numerous violent assaults, rapes, and beatings done to Claire is a comment on how men conduct themselves when they think they have absolute control over a woman, or a reflection on our 21st centrury RAPE CULTURE. Either way I don't think this t.v. series is healthy to watch because of how it portrays women as sex objects to be RAPED whenever left without the watchful eye of a man. This is unfortunate because the Scottish culture and adventure was exciting to watch.

In sum, Outlander's is written, directed, & produced in poor taste because of its obsession with repeatedly raping women! Disgusting.",1475625600,32,790,4.844444444444444

The version received shows the author does not know anything about Scotland. He makes them look like Klingons. He mixes up the 18th century with pre-Renaissance 14th century and makes the Catholics who tame and nurture orphans look as if they were abusive towards them. Also, nurses are not physicians.

The story could be told just as well, and perhaps better,  by leaving a bit to the imagination.  Not only are the scenes unnecessarily explicit, they are quite long.  It is as though the producer could not decide whether to make a porn movie or to tell a story. Well, I suppose at least there is no pizza delivery guy involved.",1475539200,13,467,4.8

The casting was fantastic, the plot is true to the books, though not identical, and the production is visually beautiful. I was very impressed. Only one warning - it is also true to the books in its graphic depiction of violence in various forms, so be aware if that bothers you.

There are quite a few rough rape and torcher scenes that I simply fast forwarded through. May I also highly encourage reading the books!

Other than that, it's an awesome story based on some historical events, which is my favorite type of program. You will fall in love with these characters who play their parts very well!  It pulls on your heart strings.
Cons: I did not really care for the abuse scenes between the 2 men in prison, but I guess it shows the brutality of some men. It could have left a little of it out and you could get the drift. Also, the sex scenes could be less vivid and you would get the drift. I don't think we have to ""bare all"" to get the idea of passion and love between 2 people.
I guess I should have given it 3 stars because of the cons, but I loved the story line so much that I have it a 5, and I couldn't wait to see all of it!",1474416000,2,806,3.769230769230769

6526273,3,B00M0GMC26,"Has some good Character build ups.  The lead Actress is very elegant, and has a strong on screen presence, and it does feel like you are in a romance novel(which I didn't know that it was).  But this is also where it falls a little short.  The story arch is a bit dry.  Granted I've only seen a few episodes(season one Episode 4) and I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.  However, single episode storylines are also a bit on the slow side.  I do find the costumes very well done, and sets very nice.  But I'm still waiting for more drama?  I will continue to watch, but pacing is to the point where I end up doing other things will its on.  I call it a ""wall paper"" show.  Here's to hoping it picks up, because I do like the concept and main character.",1474243200,,756,4.081632653061225

6526328,5,B00M0GMC26,"I wish I could give this show 500 stars! I totally loved it. It suits my interests perfectly: modern and historical drama, love story, action mixed with a little sci-fi - very well executed. The scenery was gorgeous. The actors were all amazing and I found myself watching the series back to back, hours at a time because I had to see what would happen next. The characters, Frank Randall and Black Jack Randall were both played by one person. I was amazed at how well he was able separate the two different characters. Very impressed. The actress who plays Claire is beautiful and eloquent. She can really pull off not wearing makeup. The actor who plays her romantic companion, Jamie Fraser, is very handsome and was a pleasure to watch as well. After I watched this series I immediately moved to watching the second season. It a little more disturbing but equally intriguing. I was so disappointed when I finished watching the second season because the 3rd and 4th seasons have not come out yet. Of course you are left with a cliff-hanger at the end of season 2. I read that Starz has picked up and ordered the 3rd and 4th seasons to be made but do not know when they will come out. I am so looking forward to it. Highly recommend.",1474243200,10,1234,4.488888888888889

6526372,1,B00M0GMC26,"Individual tastes differ, but I couldn't get beyond the first 30 minutes of the first episode.  To me, it had poor screenwriting and acting.",1474243200,,140,4.833333333333333
6526373,2,B00M0GMC26,"I really love the books and have read through the series several times and recommended it to others, but I think the director seriously and consistently misses key aspects of the characters, needlessly changes story line and ,the show ends up just being plain annoying and disappointing.  The Clare presented in the show is no where near the strong compassionate woman revealed in the books, and the Jaime of the show lacks the wisdom self awareness that is a strong part of the character, even in the first book when he is young.  He repeatedly displays a petulance that is just not present in the storyline, and is one of the reasons everyone loves Jaime.  Worst of all, the strong sense of humor and good humor that is a key component of both characters, and of their relationship, is omitted or short stroked way to often for me to think that the director really has a clue.
I think the cinematography, wardrobe and set design, and casting are all great.  Wonderful detail and richness.  There is plenty of story ahead, please, please, please rethink the screenwriting and directing!

It grinds to a halt within ten minutes, and I have to restart the TV to get another 6-10 minutes.  Tech support was no help.  I guess Amazon doesn't support videos unless you are paying extra for them...or something. They did give me a $5 credit for my trouble, but that is less than I am having to pay Apple TV to watch the same video.  Maybe you won't have the same problem, but I couldn't seem to get around it...except with another source.",1474156800,,557,4.257142857142857

6526498,5,B00M0GMC26,"I get lost in these episodes: brilliant natural colors as the backdrop, witty and quick dialogue in an enchanting Scottish English and Scottish Gaelic,  the irresistible chemistry between Claire and Jamie, and the unpredictability of living as a clan in the Scottish highlands under the oppressive rule of the Red Coats. The pacing of the story is perfect, as they juxtapose Claire's current life in the 18th century to her previous life in the 20th. The villain, Black Jack Randall (played by Tobias Menzies) is a brilliantly tortured soul. Menzies's ability to change his demeanor to bring Claire's loving husband, in the 20th century, to life is quite impressive. The supporting cast members, especially Jamie's band of highlanders, add humor and depth of culture to the show. I love when the writers make sure to highlight authentic Scottish traditions in the episodes. And, the opening song, ""Skye Boat"", primes one for the magic and drama that each episode delivers. I would highly recommend the whole series!",1474156800,,1015,5.114457831325301

6526758,3,B00M0GMC26,"If you've read the book, you're going to be disappointed. Beautiful scenery and the use of old Gaelic is a lovely touch that might have been improved by adding subtitles so the viewer, if not Claire, is always in the know. Plodding direction.  The character of Claire is not terribly likable although I think the actress is beautiful and tries to bring nuance to the role.  Oddly, there seems to be very little chemistry between Jamie and Claire and the story itself seems to have been rewritten in some way that has made it less compelling.  There are, however, some very good performances from the actors.  There is an added scene where Jack Randall retells the flogging of Jamie that is meant to show the moral descent of Randall and the actor was actually quite mesmerizing.  The background scenes and action in the Hall are pretty lame;  I really wanted to see attention to little details that would express the richness of the book.  Overall a middle of the road period piece video that doesn't make me want to watch Season 2.",1473638400,,1032,4.637362637362638

6526935,5,B00M0GMC26,"I absolutely adore this series. I've been a fan of the books since they first released. I remember eagerly awaiting each new book's release and being so excited to see what Claire and Jamie were up to next. Now, I feel the same way about the series. The adaptation of the series is beautiful, sweeping, epic and it honors this amazing story in an incredibly detailed way.

I will say that I have had some friends who have opted not to watch the series because there was a lot of sexual content in the opening episode. That stopped them after the first episode and they wouldn't go further. Having read the books, this didn't surprise  me. However, I have encouraged them to give the show another try. Subsequent episodes kept the  sexual activity relegated to storyline specific needs and though there are sexual scenes, it's not prominently displayed throughout all of the episodes.

I love each of the characters. I have not felt that there were any missteps with casting at all and to me, each of these actors beautifully embodies the characters.

If you are looking for a time traveling romance, historical adventure, or just some fabulous  action, Outlander has it all. Give it a try - you won't be sorry!",1473465600,2,1210,4.683962264150943

If they haven't stayed true to the book's scenes, they HAVE stayed true to Ms. Gabaldon's vision. Tobias Menzies has the hardest job of all and by golly, I don't know how he did it, but he has me crying for Frank's loss and then just as quickly he has me totally, thoroughly loathing Jack Randall. All at the same time. The man deserves an Emmy and that's saying a lot as I am partial to Jamie and Claire's characters and am Team Jamie all the way....It is all so believable, even when I want to knock Claire upside the head for being caught by the Redcoats ONE MORE TIME!!!!! JHRC! I am a writer and a very wise publisher once told me when I complained about Bella Swan acting so stupid I wanted to box her ears, that the writer did their job well, then didn't she?

6527114,5,B00M0GMC26,"Brilliant transition from book to television series! The actors have done a wonderful job at portraying truthful, relatable characters, which were so artfully crafted by Diana Gabaldon (nice subtle cameo appearance by Ms. Gabaldon in episode four, The Gathering). As with all good stories, I love some characters and despise others, Claire, Jamie, Dougal, Mrs. Fitz and Murtagh, to name a few (Tobias Menzies is so versatile and effective as Frank and Jack, I cheer for one and curse the other). The conflict is tense and gritty, which drives the story forward, completely drawing me into the world of Outlander. I really appreciate how true the production is to the books. The attention to detail is amazing, from weapons and clothing to foliage hanging in the dungeon where Claire is compelled to work as a healer; the dedication to production values are a trully a tribute to the audience. Sets, costumes, make-up, fight sequences, special effects (i.e. Columns legs are an amazing, seamless effect) make the world of Outlander come to life. I would also like to give a special mention to the composer or music director. The music is subtle and emotionally driven. It pulls me into the highlands and makes me feel the story to my core (i.e. the haunting and beautiful music when the druids are dancing around the stones at Craigh Na Dun). Kudos to Mr. Moore, the writers, directors, artisans and actors of this well executed series. Well done! This is an amazing production! I can't wait to see more.",1473120000,,1503,4.898039215686275

6527219,2,B00M0GMC26,My review is only for the season one-volume one. I have read the books by the way. All most didn't get past the first book. The reason for my criticism is the character Claire seems arrogant and has such a big smart alec mouth. The television version is not much better. All the actors seem to be well cast and perform well. Catriona is just not a very good actress.  When you first see Frank and Claire they are driving. He looks normal and she is grinning and moving around like she is at a modeling shoot. Every scene of her and Frank she is grinning and it looks a though she is constantly flirting with her husband. All her movements look like vogueing. So basically she looks like someone who is ACTING!  Other reviewers who complain about the sex are not reviewing volume one. Since I have read the books I know what is in volume 2 and it could be too much for some people. Volume one is pretty tame in that regard. The only reason I stuck it out with the books and the tv show is the character of Jamie. He is well written and well acted by Sam.  So far the books are better.,1472774400,,1083,4.172248803827751

6527254,2,B00M0GMC26,"Gorgeous to look at! Costumes, locations all breathtakingly beautiful.
And yet...
I couldn't get past the first 50 pages of the book (only tried the first one) so never finished it. But I had a friend who raved about the series, so I watched the first season, even though I didn't much care for most of the characters.
The time travel ideas were compelling; the plot is what it is because in its heart of hearts, the story is a romantic bodice-ripper, which may explain why I found both lead characters unconvincing.
The female protagonist, Claire, seems to have no self-awareness at all, and no capacity to see anyone else's point of view. The character has 3 settings: happy, sad, and defiant. If she thought to consider her words and the impact of her actions, she would have - and cause - less drama and suffering for herself and others. But then, this sort of show needs to gin up drama, so her character makes sense from this point of view.
The male protagonist, Jamie, seems like a perfect guy. He is tall, handsome, muscular, has a great sense of humor, and is a paragon of virtue. Again, just the type of hero this type of story must have.
That said, I've never been a huge fan of Tobias Menzies, but in his dual roles here, he succeeds in presenting - convincingly - two very different characters, and finding the heart of darkness in one of them. When this dark character was onscreen, he was terrifying indeed.
Other than that, it devolves into soft-core porn; nothing wrong with that, but I was hoping for more.
I'll stick with Game of Thrones... the characters and dialog on that show feel absolutely real to me.",1472774400,5,1626,4.552901023890785

6527586,3,B00M0GMC26,"Looks like many of the reviews refer to the Outlander series, not the DVD set.  I bought volumes one and two.  Very nice set but the discs I received skip badly.  Gave it 3 stars due to having the code for the online download.  I watch those from [...]  However, all four of the discs skip at some point and affect about 60% of the episodes.  It will blank, sometimes say ""invalid format"" and, then -- sometimes -- pick back up a few seconds or minutes later.  Tried the discs in a few different players, including a standard/used Blu-ray, a standard/brand new Blu-ray, and a wireless Blu-ray.  Majorly disappointed in the discs and annoyed that I didn't discover it until just after the 30 day return/exchange window.",1472083200,,718,4.5984251968503935

We are in droughtlander right now waiting for the new Season 3 to begin, so I am watching the whole series again from the beginning. I even purchased Starz for my IPad, so I can watch it anywhere at anytime.  My husband is taking me to Scotland in a few months, so I can see the land that I have fallen in love with while watching this series. Jamie and Claire's love story is so beautiful but there is also a lot of adventure and historical happenings, which makes for an all around wonderful story.  Adaptation from the books is different in parts but Ron Moore and his team have done an amazing job in keeping with the overall theme of the books, which makes us book fans very happy. The costumes and production are phenomenal and you can tell that a lot of time and effort have gone into making all things as accurate as possible for the time periods. If you have not read these books or seen this Starz production, please give yourself a gift and do both.

The landscapes and outdoor country scenes are lovely and make me want to go to Scotland. However, two things I don't like.

6528508,5,B00M0GMC26,"I absolutely love this show!  I have my Amazon Prime Starz subscription specifically so I can watch it.  I am a bit of a history nut, so I love period dramas anyway.  This series fits right into that interest.  To begin with, the story is based on what I think are some great books and I really like the way those books are being adapted to TV.  I don't say that lightly.  I'm definitely the sort of person who usually always likes the books better than the TV or Film adaptations and I don't take kindly to screenwriters who think they can do a better job than the original author of the works.  That said, I really love the way this has been done.  I highly recommend this series if you like historical period romance.",1470096000,2,720,4.281481481481482

Glad that they are sticking closely to the events in the book. It is really nice to see it in action. I know our imagination can provide us an insight on what it must have been like, but seeing it in film makes it come to life more.

This is a very sweet, complicated love story, with beautiful historical details embedded in all facets of the show. It's also a very interesting take on time travel with a splash of Scottish folk lore to power the fantastical.  It's shot on location & the scenery is almost it's own character.  Love the costuming; very period appropriate. I'm an avid fiber artist & really like that they have employed local crafts people to create beautiful knit items from traditional patterns.
The actors sell the show and make you love & hate the characters. There are episodes I can't treat her because the are so so wrenching. Stars did a great job all around on this show.",1469923200,2,751,4.597014925373134

Ronald Moore who also developed the Battlestar Gallactica series, which was also captivating, has developed this show so if you know his work, you know it's good.  From the story to the acting to the music and beautiful shots of the rich country land, Outlander is one of my favorites.

Sets and costumes are much more than what you're used to seeing on television, writing is superb (especially anything penned by Matthew B. Roberts or Toni Graphia), and Bear McCreary's music is so incredible I guarantee you'll want to buy the score.

6528850,5,B00M0GMC26,"I enjoyed Outlander Season one Volume 1,  there are parts that I do not agree with, most of these are things that Moore changed, and added people  and things that were already there.  There was no need to change the ring, the original one was lovely, they used the key to Lallybroch. They could have used the key, and made the same lovely ring. They are putting more  sex into it supposedly to bring more readers into the fold.  The readers are already in there and Iike the  books  as  they  were  written,  Some sex is ok, but to put more than Diana put in is to take from her fantastic writing.  Her books do not have to have things thrown in or to bring more audience, The people already love her writing.  I feel if a book is full of sex, its because the author does not have the ability to keep their readers reading and interested.  Im afraid I went a little farther than just volume one.  I love the whole series, and have read it 3 times.  You always find something that may have been missed in the first 1 or 2 readings. I give it 5 stars because of Diana's writing, The books are strong enough to keep the reading and the viewing of the books enjoyable, and that is due to such great writing.  It is enjoyable to watch what you have already read, to see how much of the original book is left alone.  I realize things have to be changed a bit, because the time constrictions put in the viewing  compared with what you can read.  I still give it 5 stars, as I said because mostly because of the writing. Don't misunderstand me. Moore is doing a fantastic job filming Outlander.  I just hope he doesn't change too much.

6529881,3,B00M0GMC26,"Okay series, but have not seen anything in this story-line that has not been done before by others.  In fact, wasn't Outlander about a British or Scot MAN that goes back in time?  I think this is the exact same thing, but from a woman's perspective.  The scenery is beautiful, but most of the United Kingdom rural areas are, whether your in the Highlands, or on the Emerald Isle.

Other than it is OK, I won't say more than that since many seem to think the world of this show.  I personally would not devout $40 for a season of this.",1468713600,,534,4.247524752475248
6529882,2,B00M0GMC26,"The scenery, costumes, and acting are great in this series, however, the story is just bad and the characters are terrible. I have not read the books that this is based on, but I started watching because some of my friends were raving about it. It has a lot of things that I usually like: a little bit of fantasy, a little bit of historical fiction, some romance. Every time one of the main characters tells the other one to do or not do something, the other one does exactly the opposite. Then one of them gets captured. Then there's a ridiculous escape/rescue. Then they are angry with each other, then they cry, then they make love. Wash, rinse, repeat. This sequence gets boring really quickly.

The three main actors (that play Claire, Jamie, and Randall) are great, and they have chemistry that you can feel from their first scenes together, especially Claire and Jamie. The supporting actors are also good, and the roles provide some much needed humor breaks from all the crying and tragedy between Jamie and Claire.

The last two episodes were unwatchable due to the EXTREME and gruesome violence and torture (mental, emotional, and physical). I had to fast forward through about 90 minutes total. Besides that sequence, the entire series is filled with rapes, near/almost rapes, and gratuitous violence. I'm not squeamish or a prude, but this was just over the top, and I don't condone using rape/violence/torture as a plot device. Ugh.",1468713600,19,1445,4.82258064516129

It was good to see how men and women lived, in this era.  Watching this movie makes you think about all the wonderful things we take for granted. For me running women having a voice, water, vehicles, feminine products, paved roads, blow-dryer, cloths that aren't so heavy to wear, toilet paper and bathrooms are a few of the things that come to mind.  I am sure there are more things that I am missing. You are going to love this series.  I am not one to get excited about good looking men but Sam is on another whole level of hotness! Wow!

The storyline keeps you involved to the point where I have to turn it off as the hour gets late. The actors are terrific. Claire is strong, confident with firey independent spirit considering women's roles in both timelines. Frank's dual character is handled brilliantly and Jamie is boyish with an induring attraction as innocent and manly which makes me wish I was Claire. The Scottish accent can be hard to catch from time to time but that's why Closed Caption is an option. Love the show and will not hesitate to purchase Season 2.",1468627200,,703,4.723577235772358

The books are excellent, well written and researched so as to make this period piece feel real.  The TV series by necessity cannot developed characters (minor) to the same extent as the books do and that is understandable.  Abridging the story is also understandable.  A couple of things were added thus far that were not in the books (Frank''s quest for Claire and his despair was not related in the books) and that was a pleasant addition.  We all have our own ideas as to what the characters from the books look like and my Jamie was hit right on the nose.  Claire not so much, her acting has done the book character justice though.  All in all a most enjoyable and entertaining cinema experience.",1468540800,,826,4.578231292517007

6530645,1,B00M0GMC26,I read and liked the first book. The first several episodes of season 1 were just ok. Whole episodes devoted to cruelty and sex is a tragedy. What a waste of time and money. Some things are better left for the imagination. Claire uses words and phrases that no one in Gaelic speaking Scotland would even begin to understand-especially in the 18th century. Unrealistic and above all - TRASHY! It is a shame because the scenery and costumes are gorgeous.,1468281600,8,452,4.6625
6530646,5,B00M0GMC26,I love this show.,1468281600,,17,3.5
6530647,2,B00M0GMC26,"BE WARNED - This show has a multiple personality problem. Vol. 1 is a captivating historical drama sprinkled with romance, but  in vol. 2  it turns into RAPE PORN. I'm not joking. Consider watching this show very carefully, because some images may stay with you.

Outlander's1st season with its 16 episodes was aired in 2 parts, 8 episodes each  ( here on Amazon It's referred to as  season 1 vol. 1 and vol. 2 ). I watched it on Starz channel and was totally hooked by the first part. Unfortunately I did not know the show would turn so violent and disturbing at the second part.  Had I known it in advance I would not have started watching it in the first place.

I did not read the book or heard of it prior to watching the show, so had no way of telling exactly what it's about. Usually I steer clear of the romance aisle in book stores but the show is done very cleverly, and it drew me in intro a setting of a rich and detailed historical drama. Romance came into the picture a little later, and when it did it was very touching and beautiful.
Even for a cynic such as myself It was simply impossible not to fall in love with Jamie Fraser ( super hot Sam Hughan ) and to root for his love affair with the other main character. By episode 7 I was down with the whole romantic stuff, and then came along Episode 8 ( both sides now ) with a HUGE cliff hanger, and I was left at the edge of my seat awaiting, anxiously,  the next episode that was like 6 MONTHS away.

Needless to say my expectations were high. I totally obsessed about the show, and convinced a great number of people to watch it. After a 6 months break the wait was over, and vol. 2 aired - and what started as a swashbuckling romance turned into a hard core rape porn.

Game of thrones got a lot attention and criticism for their excessive use of violence and sex, but it is NOTHING compared to the scenes awaiting for you here. Since this is not a fantasy TV show with snow zombies and dragons, every thing here seems much. much more real.  Just like in GOT the impact of the show lies heavily on production value, and it's stunningly beautiful and seems very accurate. Outlander's set designers and costume department made an epic and triumphant effort to transport you to the 18th century Scottish highlands, but sadly, it seems that there was a special department there that made the same effort to construct hyper realistic and detailed torture and rape scenes, designed to make you feel you are in the same room where they take place.
There is a whole episode that lingers on and on an on on those LONG rape scenes, savouring every minute of physical, sexual and emotional abuse one can think of. It was horrible to watch, and I'm very sorry I did.
By that time I was totally invested in the story and in the characters and I just had to see what happens ,and although I knew by then that things are about to turn ugly ( from the producers and actors commenting online on what's ahead ), I could not believe how far they would go  and portray shocking cruelty with so much detail.

Other than the fact that I was heart broken for my beloved fictional characters being abused and tortured , I find that the way it was portrayed in the show outraging for more reasons than the fact that it wasn't nice to watch. It took me a few days to recover from the last two episodes, and I felt disgusted and manipulated into watching something I would never have watched. I feel like i was lured to be a deprived peeper who pressed ""play"" and watches a video that shows ISIS beheading someone or doing some other horrific things just out of curiosity.
I'm sorry, I'm not curious about abuse and and I do not want to watch things like that.

There are a lot of die hard fans of the Outlander book series that might claim that all the sexual violence is in the book and that it's a vital part of the story and character's development, and that it was important to show it in this shocking manner. I disagree in advance.  For starters -  I fail to see the ""beauty"" and the value of those scenes in the book, where the author just goes out of her way to think of sadistic ways to torment and humiliate human beings. I honestly can't understand those who read that book and enjoyed it. But let's leave that point aside -  Books and TV are very different media, and you know what they say - a picture is worth a thousand words. What's shocking to read is a thousand times more shocking to watch.  I still shiver.",1468281600,2,4471,4.296076099881094

6531070,5,B00M0GMC26,"I absolutely love this show.  The characters are rich and storyline is always moving with twists and turns.  After watching the first season I sought out the books because I had to know what happens next.  I pleasantly surprised to find that the show follows the storyline of the books.  Unlike other shows that have simply ruined the story from the book, this one adds to it.  Whenever the show deviates from the books it is small and adds to the richness of the story.
It is well written and well acted.  It is not a family show, be forewarned of significant, graphic violence and nudity.  It is a show for adults.
The final episode - spoiler alert - Jamie is held prisoner by Capt. Jack Randall. I had been warned about the extreme violence in this episode and have never watched the ""breaking"" of Jamie.  Fast forward is my friend.  I watched the aftermath of that and the impact on Jamie and his wife.
Despite those scenes, I still love the storyline, the characters and the way it is brought to the screen!  I hope they make all 9 books.",1467763200,,1043,4.4136125654450264

There are no twists and turns or any real strategy / story just ... sigh ... soft porn and a woman who thinks herself better than everyone else. She's annoying and he's hot at the beginning and then he slowly loses his manhood and becomes ridiculous. I have never seen a story or show so convenient in it's happenings. Things just happen as needed, no real reason or intelligence to it, it just happens. A woman just happens to get past all these soldiers unarmed to reach the dungeons to save her husband by herself ... ugh  ... please. Don't expect anything more than emotions and girly girl ordeals, this is not Game of Thrones or anywhere close to. I should say I'm not a girly girl, and I hate predictable writing and whiny women so clearly this was not my show to begin with so take it for what it's worth. I gave it two stars because it's not a horrible series it's just not my kind of series or rather it's very simple.",1467244800,2,1090,4.29126213592233

Oh, it's compelling alright. It's taken from a historical romance series, I gather, and there's nothing wrong with that. The acting seems solid too. AND, there's even a literal bodice ripper (from Season 1, volume 1).
The characters are lovely to look at and handsomely rugged too.
There are many things to like, for sure. But I think it's the writing that has it fall flat. Not always, but enough to jar you out of your evening reverie as you are carried away to 18th century Scotland.",1467158400,,726,4.9105691056910565

6531434,5,B00M0GMC26,"As a Scot - thought it as close a rendition as I have seen of the mores of the times (and may help explain why we have 'differences' with/to the English....However much better it is than Braveheart (450 years previously)  there are a couple of criticisms
-1) you MUST be aware that if it is a PAL dvd  will NOTplay on NTSC/Region 1,(which are US /Canada only)....Europe is Region2....so ensure your dvd player will handle it -OR get  a region free-We have the same problems in reverse using your dvds -but read the packaging!)
2) ALthough there are subtitles in 4-5 languages Why oh Why did they not have the sections in native Gaelic (the old language of the Highlands)-subtitled at the very least??? I can understand it may add a certain layer of authenticity to the main character as being in an ''alien'' environment as is frequently mentioned, but just to say 'speaks in Other language'' is somewhat insulting in this case...
3) for those who find it a bit 'rough and ready....well, it was ...modern sensibilties are perhaps so 'PC some may forget that it wasn't always so.....and be happy we live in an age of central heating and -so far- still functioning anti-biotics.
so.although I haven't finished the first series yet I am fairly confident  that the levels of behaviour shown are reasonably representative of the age.....and certainly how different cultures on these islands treated each other.....and that loyalty is earned....not 'bought' (or should i say rented' -that has a different name here.
4) One or two anachronisms have crept in....For instance the lawyer uses 'OK' which ,as far as I am aware wasn't used in the UK till WWII and I was surprised she hadn't been hung  (or burned)as a witch by about episode 4 or 5.....
5) while the origin of thename cruil]kshank may have become apparent he level of dentition in thefilm  is(of course)MUCH higher than in those days.....and almost everyone  has shoes !!!",1467158400,4,1926,4.818181818181818

The show has done a fabulous job of adapting the book to a television format without sacrificing plot points or having to change many things at all, which I really appreciate.

I do enjoy it from an aesthetic standpoint, as Scotland's stark beauty is captivating; I am planning my vacation there for next year! I do enjoy it from a history standpoint as well. As the series went on though, I found myself disliking the main character of Claire, as well as just not buying her rapid adjustment to life in the 18th century. Let's imagine for a minute, in the blink of an eye, finding ourselves 200 years in the past. It would be devastating and completely and utterly terrifying...to start! Absolutely everything and everyone u know is gone...poof! It was just too easy. Claire, as a person...well...she is not a good one. Selfish, arrogant, outspoken in the worst way, reckless, heartless, vain, disloyal (to Frank), etc. I just ultimately had no interest in following what happens to such a person.",1466899200,2,891,4.830065359477124

The casting is spot on, the writing and acting is superb, and when they deviate from the book it's minor and very well done.

6531976,5,B00M0GMC26,"Initially I checked this series out at the Library, because it looked interesting.  I fell in love with it immediately!  I had to own it, so I bought it from Amazon.  The second season is currently under way on Starz, but I don't have cable.  I can't wait to see season 2!  The story is based on the books by Diana Gabaldon.  Her Outlander series currently totals 8 books.  I have started to read the series.  Each book is over 600 pages long, so it will take a while.  The TV series does an excellent job of following the characters and scenes written in the books. However, I do find the TV series more enthralling, because the characters are much more animated with their Scottish accents, which is not as clearly indicated in the books.  The first season (Volume one and Volume two) only covers the first book Outlander.  The story line is interesting, because it throws a married woman for 1945 into a dangerous Scotland in 1743, under British rule.  She is a head-strong independent modern woman who has to come to terms with 1743 society where women were in constant peril and had little say or control over their own lives.  She initially finds herself in the position of being suspected as a spy by both the Scottish clan that is keeping her, and by the British. In order to protect her from the evil hands of her 1945 husband's ancestor, the clan decides it would be best for all concerned if she married Jamie, who is a relative of the clan's leaders.  She struggles with the morality of being married to two different men, from two different times, but does her best to cope with her current situation, when all she really wanted was to find a way home.  Under the circumstances, she starts to fall in love with her new husband, but Scottish life continues, with its ups, downs, and political intrigues, and she continues to serve as the healer (because she is a nurse) for the clan. Because she is from the future, she also has some knowledge of events that are about to unfold that may be used to help the clan she is with, especially since she is now a member of it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-One-Blu-ray-UltraViolet/dp/B00RLK35H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume One (Blu-ray + UltraViolet)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outlander-Season-One-Volume-Two-Blu-ray/dp/B00VMIU3CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outlander: Season One - Volume Two [Blu-ray</a>]",1466812800,2,2505,5.2275

Outlander doesn't shy away from dealing with even the most difficult of topics such as all the brutality of war and the savagery that man is capable of at times, such as rape and torture.  But there is also plenty of love, romance and of course sex to help balance things out a bit throughout the episodes, making Outlander a truly great experience to watch and become part of.

6532518,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've read all the books, and this film is very true to the story. Because it's complex, the film uses flashbacks (or flash-forwards?!) to help explain what's going on and why Claire makes certain decisions.
However, my husband, who has not read the books, has a bit of a hard time with the characters, and is glad to have me with him to explain who is who - but when I first read the books, I had a similar problem. Still, the gist of the story pulls you along it's still enthralling.
It is a very suspenseful tale, and beautifully portrays the dangers of life in 17th century Scotland. The main characters (Claire and Jaime) are well chosen for their roles, and the dynamic between them is intense.
Readers of Diana Gabaldon's books will not be disappointed!",1466208000,2,759,4.547445255474453

6532836,4,B00M0GMC26,"Stubble upon this by accident and since we were ready for a new ""binge worthy"" show decided to try it.  It sneakily pulls you it and before you know it you hooked.  Spoiler alert: cool how the second half of the first season appears to be told by Jaime rather than Clare.  Love it for chance of perspective.  And all along you wonder after meeting the infamous Black Jack Randall, how Clare will ever try to find her way home or have fears of who's lies deep inside current day Jack/James and will it surface if Clare returns.  Definitely hooked at this point. Interesting to see where this leads.  PS. If you like Scotish/Bristish history, you will even enjoy more.  A romance novel perhaps for everyone.",1465689600,,705,4.5476190476190474

6532854,4,B00M0GMC26,"Great story. It's over the top with the nudity and sex scenes. Steamy but distracting. It's a good enough plot and depiction that the graphic romance stuff isn't necessary to maintain the viewer's interest. This story has a magnetic leading man, feisty leading woman, supremely villainous bad guy, great camera work, costumes, scenery, supporting cast, and ya gotta love those Scottish accents!",1465689600,,394,5.370967741935484

I love the characters.  Would be nice if more characters are developed.  Wives children etc. It is a good story.  Sad with all the brutality of the world.  It is the human condition.  SO far I like the courage and commitment it portrays.  It is not easy to stay committed to overcoming.  It takes character.",1465689600,,434,4.4743589743589745

6532880,5,B00M0GMC26,"Beautifully rendered film of Diana Gabaldon's book - Outlander!!  I have read this series a number of times and am very impressed by the interpretation of her work.  The characters are stunningly portrayed...the filming is magnificent and I am so pleased to see these characters come to life through this medium.  Oh and I forgot to mention the costuming!  Terry Dresbach (costume designer) is a magical being with magical thinking and magical creativity...how she and her crew create all of the garments and accessories required for this show is beyond me!  I believe everything is made as there certainly isn't a warehouse filled with 18th century clothing and accessories for hire!  Back to the filming - the sets and environments for filming are breath taking...every item, every detail is spectacular.  Thank you all for creating such a beautiful series!",1465689600,2,859,5.136690647482014

6532883,5,B00M0GMC26,"The entire series is stupendous! Each episode is faithful to Gabaldon's series of books...so far. The historical realism is unlike any other history series, including The Vikings. The actors and their characters 'grow on you' with each episode, especially Jamie and Claire.

6532918,4,B00M0GMC26,Amazing acting and realistic 18th century for the most part. Loses a star for flashing to her back in the 1940's in beginning of season 2. And a little too keen on rape. But really a fab series outside those few points,1465689600,,218,4.214285714285714

Dogmatic restrictions to the exact text hardly ever work (Season One of Game of Thrones a notable exception).  Outlander stays in the spirit of the book while making small textual, narrative, and story changes to better fit ""the small screen"".

Um . . . not for the kiddies.  Dang near some ""Red Shoes Diary"" scenes, haha.  Enjoy some ""adult time"" and watch this series.  You won't be sorry.",1465430400,,510,4.419354838709677

I was glad to see the series, but the thing is a hot mess. Some bits good and others abysmal.  The bad really sours what is left.

Cable and the insistence of near porn. The rise and fall of vpices- indistinguisable, difficult to grasp.

At first, it was a bit of a shock seeing the characters on screen but not quite how I had them pictured.  I soon recovered however and am impressed with all the actors talent and abilities as well as the screen writers and whomever else may be involved in staying so true to the book and for creating such beautiful historical time periods.  For those interested in the series but are not familiar with the book, there is graphic content - mostly sexual.  I can assure all that this is ""simply"" how it was written, however I believe the book allows for more nuanced explanations for the why's and wherefores which make it more an understandable part of some characters as opposed to what might easily be construed as gratuitous sex scenes.

The books are incredibly written and the history impressively researched.  The series being created for Starz seems to be just the same.  Highly recommend!!",1464825600,2,976,4.705882352941177

6533673,5,B00M0GMC26,"Years ago a literary friend recommended the Outlander novels by Diana Gabaldon, assuring me they were excellent. But I had a knee-jerk negative reaction to the fantasy aspect and never took her advice. My mistake! Gabaldon holds a PhD in quantitative behavioral ecology, so she's no dummy. The magnificent world she created is gritty, absorbing, and brought vividly to life in this outstanding production. Sure, the protagonist, Claire, is stunning, and her 18th century love Jamie is pure eye candy. But the themes, plot lines, and character development delight the intellect as well. Claire is every bit equal to the male characters, which led BuzzFeed to dub Outlander the feminist answer to 'Game of Thrones.'"" I intended to watch only during the one-week free trial period. Ha!

6533766,2,B00M0GMC26,"Trite, boring and strange in its use of music. Over all the premise seems promising with lots of potential for an interesting story line... then it just bogs  down into a novella soap opera with the same old same old. If one is a fan of network TV and watches the lifetime channel then this show is for you. If you are more inclined toward the outside of the box creative story telling this show is not for you. Think ""Downton Abby"" mixed with the ""Time  Traveler's Wife"" set in Scotland. Beautiful scenery, Historically accurate to a point but bland story that is just a rehash of things you have seen before. It's trying very hard to be something and it is missing the mark.

A few minutes after being transported back 200 years, give or take, our plucky heroine expertly analyzes what has transpired, trims her sails and sets her course through what is about to befall her. If that's not plucky...All the characters are here, in place and on cue: The Handsome Stranger, The Dastardly Villain(s), The Roly-Poly Cook, ready with a ""cuppa brooth"" and a wardrobe that needs no alterations to turn our no-nonsense time traveler into the Belle o' the Ball. Hoot, Mon! But there's treachery afoot! Knowing glances and backhanded stage whispers abound as our...here it comes!... plucky imposter bungles her way through court intrigue and lustful innuendoes spewed by grubby but noble Highlanders that seem to carry their blankets around with them at all times. And not a dry cleaner in sight. I ""ken"" what's going to happen, but to be fair, I will watch 2 more episodes to see if a spanner is thrown into the works.

Thank goodness, I didn't watch it with my mother or sons, I would have been mortified.  It does not warrant 5 stars and cannot imagine anyone sitting through the entire torture and rape scene.  I am compelled to write this review to bring down the rating to something more realistic and forewarn viewers.

On the other hand, the changes that have been made are improvements over the books. Actors are quite good. Love the costumes. (Although, it seems as if Claire has far too many dresses that are far too nice for the situation. Attempting to run away in a formal ball gown seemed a bit much. Beautiful, though!)

6533960,5,B00M0GMC26,"As an adamant fan and follower of Gabaldon's books for 20+ years, I was hesitant about purchasing this series.  The characters of Jamie and Claire are beloved to me.  I couldn't image how the breadth and depth of the characters, or the complex story told through her many books, could ever truly be brought to the screen with any justice.  But, I was wrong.  This series is as true a representation of the original books as I think could be made.  Visually it is heartstopping.  The costumes/sets authentic.  And the acting... Sam Heughan and Catriona Balfe (unknown to me prior to this series) are beyond belief.  I never would have thought anyone could so embody the characters of Jamie and Claire.  In fact, I didn't even want to see anyone try.  But, having now been swept up in viewing three seasons, I can no longer read the books without seeing the faces of Heughan and Balfe, and it makes the books even more poignant.  The episodes are stunning in their graphic portrayal of the books.  Many viewers will be repulsed by the violence and sexual content.  But, like the books, the series does a masterful job of weaving a timeless love story through a period of extreme violence and loss.  Not for everyone, but for fans of Gabaldon's books the series will leave you speechless.",1464566400,,1285,4.653333333333333

The lead actors, Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan fit my vision of Claire & Jamie to a tee.  The supporting cast is equally outstanding, especially Tobias Menzies in his duel role.  I discovered the Starz show first and then began reading the beautifully written books by Diana Gabaldon.  The show is currently at book 2, I am at book 5.  I strongly recommend you read along or ahead. There are differences, as you would expect, between the two versions, but the creators of this show really have tried to keep the spirit and intent of the books in tact while having to move the story along at a much bigger pace.  The locations, the sets, are spectacular. I don't know how they can afford to create the world of 18th century Scotland and Paris.  The costumes alone must cost a fortune. Attention to detail makes me feel as if I am living this adventure with them. The books are all quite large. I am totally addicted and have found lots of fellow Outlanders to chat with on social media.

I ended up enjoying the season quite a bit and looked forward to the next season with gusto.  Great acting, beautiful scenery, beautiful actors and yes, the costumes were nice too.  Note:  based on some of the reviews, it seems evident that the series doesn't coincide with the books they are supposed to reflect.

6534202,1,B00M0GMC26,"Entertainment is one thing, it is quite another thing entirely to act out in FULL and to show and glamourise SEXUAL VIOLENCE. Viewers beware when watching this series you will be subjected to sadism and to the rape of a man and a small child. When did it become OK (LEGAL) and fashionable for actors, producers and directors to make visual representations of sexual violence to such a realistic degree? How is it legal for a child actor to play the part of a rape victim?  When did this become acceptable, that we pay hard earned money to allow this horror into our homes, with NO clear warning? Surely, such things cannot pass for entertainment? We do not need to film sexually violent situations acted out to such a high visceral level as this, in order to make viewers have an emotional response or for an attempt at historical accuracy. A hint, is just fine. Those of us with imaginations can fill in the details, if we so wish. This shows carries three strong themes: Sexual violence, general violence and Catholicism.",1464134400,18,1023,4.651933701657459

However, I did enjoy the series. The casting is PERFECT!
I have to begin by saying that I have read ALL of the OUTLANDER novels and adored them. The writing is magnificent, with humor and great characterizations. The TV series has wonderful acting but Claire and Jaime are a bit different from what I had in my mind, but very close.
I think Frank/Black Jack is an excellent actor!! I would love to continue watching him but I'm not going to pay the money.
I cannot give five stars simply because of the graphic nudity and sex. Yes, there is graphic sex in the novels but I guess I don't remember that there is so much. I think it's a bit gratuitous in the series.
I did go ahead and buy the musical score for the series, as it is beautiful and very haunting. For the music and scenery alone, I would watch the series again.",1464048000,3,1007,4.3052631578947365

But the books are not only a LOT better, the story is changed in the first season and in the second season it is changed even more.  I'm not talking about leaving things out like I know has to happen but they have CHANGED the story.  Also the character of Claire has changed!  She really pisses me off in the series but in the books I really like her.  She is stupid and arrogant and makes decisions no 21st century woman with any sense of history would make in the series.  But in the book she is true to character.  I do not like the changes to the story in the series it cheapens the story and lessens the depth of it as well.  I think they could have done a much better job I am very disappointed in it.",1464048000,3,774,3.9483870967741934

6534585,4,B00M0GMC26,"I give this series 4 and a half stars.  The historical recreation of both 1945 UK and 1743 UK are very convincing.  Being a stickler for historical accuracy, I couldn't give them 5 stars due to some inaccurate statements such as when Frank Randall in 1945, said to be a huge European history buff, incorrectly said that the Scottish Highlanders and other soldiers who fought against the army of King George II were armed mostly with broadswords.  In fact, most of the rebels had matchlock muskets.  They lost the Battle of Culloden bigtime because of exhaustion, poor leadership, and much inferior use of their artillery, which was also inferior in number to those had by the Duke of Cumberland.  But Frank was right about the violent suppression and dismantling of the Scottish Clan system after Culloden and about the Highlanders not being allowed to carry swords afterwards.  Caitriona Balfe does a marathon job of acting in a show where she is almost always in the spotlight.  Also, Tobias Menzies does a remarkable job of playing 2 men with practically opposite personalities.  He portrays the monstrous, sadistic Black Jack Randall with chilling and deep effect.",1463875200,3,1168,4.984536082474227

There was no way it could be done. I finally broke down and watched it a few  weeks ago. It is WONDERFUL! I couldn't believe it. The actors are ALL great. Its stayed true to the books this far.

At first I wasn't sure about the show and because I never read the series, I felt that I would be left out of the loop on some things; but I was wrong. Claire's Journey through time from post World War 1940's (which is an interesting time period to begin, but I'm told that further in the series the characters are met in present day. so make sure to keep up) to mid 18th century from a set of stones in the Scottish Highlands. From there, it gets interesting and even if your not a serious history buff then the romantic story between Claire and (oh so ever HOT and SEXY) Jamie is worth watching. Though I can't help wondering if she was meant to be there and help cause a lot of that country's history. ~smirks~ Thats the thing about stories with the time travel effect, you get more questions then answers..........",1463184000,3,868,4.43125

6535482,5,B00M0GMC26,"I have been waiting for some sort of video for this book series, a movie, a television show, something, anything. The series of books is fantastic and I think the actors are doing an amazing job of representing their characters from the book. My only complaint would be that I wish they weren't split into 2 volumes, but they follow the storyline incredibly close and I really have become invested in their characters. Can't wait for season 2 to be out on DVD or Blu-ray, I know you can subscribe to Showtime to watch it but I prefer having a hard copy so I can watch them over and over!
Honestly I wish there were more books telling me what happens after the characters reunite after book 8 but that is just my wishful thinking. A great show!

The settings and acting are superb. Many people will be intrigued by references to the supernatural, changeling, pagan rites etc. These beliefs still persist in the Highlands as does the distrust of outsiders I don't consider this a time travel book, though.

The love story between Jamie and Claire was so beautiful and touching that I longed for them to be able to be together without the strife and pain that was constantly haunting them at every corner.

It is sensually and sexually rich, deeply romantic and gritty at turns.  Caitriona Balfe as Claire Fraser, Tobias Menzies as both Frank and Jonathon Randall, and Sam Heugen as Jaime Fraser are nothing short of brilliant.  The rest of the cast also shines in a textured portrayal of a most unexpected love triangle, lived out across two centuries of English and Scots history.

The acting is great. The fights are reminiscent of the Vikings. The politics are complex. The scenery is expansive. The castles and countryside seem totally authentic. The villains are nasty. The sex is erotic. I have no trouble believing that the stories are true to actual history, perhaps save the ""witchcraft"" and time travel.

6536012,4,B00M0GMC26,"The TV show is like Cliff notes for the actual books.  But there is no way a TV show could go to the level of detail that the books do.  That being said, the STARs series is trying valiantly to be faithful to the spirit of the books and provide new content to build on the story that Diana Gabaldon created.  The costumes alone are worth the price of the STARs subscription!  And the locations are just as I imagined they should be.  Caitriona Balfe is the perfect Claire.  Astounding.  Sam Heughan looks the part and acts the part, but he has a bit of growth to do to become the larger than life real MAN that Jamie is in the books.  I think it has to do with an inner sense of history and spark of iron that it took to be a man in those times.  Who knows?  All in all, I recommend watching the series, but I recommend reading the books more.",1462752000,,843,4.054545454545455

6536144,2,B00M0GMC26,"I started watching this series with hope and anticipation.  I continued to watch it even though I lost the hope, and finally the anticipation of episodes to come.  I expected an exciting fantasy, but what I got was an endless, boring love story, sprinkled with a few scenes of fun, gratuitous violence, and the occasional male tumescence.  I've nothing against love stories, but if I want to watch one that's what I'll stream, not a show that touts itself as an exciting fantasy.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this series.  Perhaps it will get better, as I only managed to make it through 6 episodes, but, for me it was downright painful to watch.  That being said I don't wish to diminish the achievements of the actors, the director, or those fantastic set/costume folks.  As a period piece it sets itself up quite nicely.  In point of fact it's clear the team works hard at doing their job, and extra hard, unfortunately, at turning what could have been a thrilling, exciting trip into fantasyland, but that's not their fault.  That's the flawed script derived from the written stories of Diana Gabaldon, who may well have set up to write a love story after all.  If so, she succeeded.",1462665600,2,1193,4.6923076923076925

6536206,3,B00M0GMC26,"Very atmospheric in parts and set against the majestic backdrop of the Highlands, but the action is too slow and the dialogue is often clumsy and wooden. The series is unfair to both the Scots and the English of 1743 who are mostly painted as brutish and foul-mouthed louts and low-lifes. There is no resemblance to David Balfour and Alan Breck Stewart in R. L. Stevenson's Kidnapped. That is not to say that there aren't quite a few strong performances (Colum, the chief of the Mackenzie clan and his brother, Dougal, Mrs Fitzgibbons, and the lawyer who accompanies Dougal on his round of rent collecting). Claire's other love interest, Jamie Fraser, is too good to be true. The series has an obsession with rape (or near-rape) and torture which it portrays in almost loving detail and which are allowed to slow the action to a snail's pace.",1462579200,,842,4.73469387755102

6536386,5,B00M0GMC26,"While it can't match the books because we miss some of the sharp tongued and hilarious internal reflections and musings of Claire, the series is quite satisfying.  Also, what a relief to have the consistent use of a feminist perspective as Claire's sexuality is expressed on screen.  There is a lot of TV and film that I decline to watch because rape is used as a plot device.  But the Outlander series manages to deal with the threat of rape, and the evils of Black Jack Randal, while addressing the deep psychological damage created in full-bodied characters.  My only objection is that the gay characters are drawn as perverted (Black Jack and Sandringham), or as foppish (Sandringham), not as individuals figuring out a way to live well in a heterocentric society--but that is an issue I have with the books, as well as the TV series.",1462492800,,838,4.719178082191781

The evolution of Jamie & Claire's attachment is extremely well acted and convinces you they would die for each other.

So far, this show has morphed into a period talk fest that is boring in my eyes.  The first episode of season 2 started out great with Claire's return to 1940's England and her loving husband very glad to see and care for her.
Next thing you know she's on a ship with her husband Jamie from 150 years ago.  I don't understand how she just reappeared to the past again.
When they arrive in Paris, that is where this show turned to the talk fest.  Even the sex scenes have been tamed down to boring.
Without being snarky or rude, can anyone explain all this to me?  I understand their purpose of heading off the war.  I'll try to watch a couple of more episodes and hope it gets better.

6537108,5,B00M0GMC26,Like tobacco and caffeinated beverages this show is easy to get hooked on. Caitriona Balfe is a superb actress. This is a great escapist show and recommended for those who like period pieces where one can suspend reality for just a bit. The characters are relative well developed and each episode will keep you on the edge of your seat. The costuming is interesting (of course there seems to be the omnipresent cleavage dresses) and the grimy aspects of ever day living in 1700s Scotland adds to the fun. Not sure how long they'll be able to string this one out until they run out of story but this first year has been great for end of the evening watching. One warning - the first episode is slow developing so you need to stick with it at least through episode 2.,1461974400,,765,4.432624113475177

6537139,3,B00M0GMC26,"Too coincidental for my liking.  Druids were around for a long time, apparently their 4th and most recent revival was in the 16th century, which is the 1500s, so when this woman is at a Druid site and taken back in time why is it exactly the time frame that her husband is interested in and researching?  Why not the 1500s or even 3000 BC when Druids first came about?  Yeah, it's fiction, but this coincidence bugs the heck out of me.  Everything is built on this flashback in time and she wasn't doing anything at the time she time traveled that would specifically link her to that very particular time frame.  She was picking a flower... heck, she should go back to the time that flower germinated, which would make at a little sense..

6537484,5,B00M0GMC26,"while definately not for children or sensitive adults as there are graphic scenes, this is an excellent series made from the books.
The author makes a cameo appearance too. At the end of each show, there is a very interesting interview with the director, Roger Moore,
 a costume designer and others concerning some of their choices for script, costuming, scenery. These will give an rich view of the
period, why if may or may not differ from the books, and their choices as artists...and that they are in full.
If the viewer has read the books, they may find some things changed or left out, but that is the way of movies...not all can be included due to the time frame. However, much can be ""seen"" that takes many words to describe.  The actors are wonderful, well cast in their parts and should receive many awards, hopefully. I hope to see them again in many films. The Director, Roger Moore, was an excellent choice for the making of Outlander.
The crew and many people responsible for making this such an incredibly beautiful, visual film....well, I just can't say enough good things about them.  They are highly skilled, for sure, and have hearts and minds of artists.  As a historical romance, and that is ROMANCE in capital letters,
it is rich, dense, and seamless.  Odd words, perhaps to describe a romance, but there are lovely and tender visuals which are balance with
the beautiful scenes of countryside. It gives the viewer a groundedness even though it is basically a ""time traveler"" theme.
I, of course, binge-watched the entire series!
Things to watch for:  can you catch any of the Computer Graphic inserts? (explained by the Director)
Costumes:  incredible and they spared nothing to make them for the principle actors. Even the supporting cast have great costumes and their roles are nicely give some screen time too. I think that in itself, gives more verisimilitude to the film.  (explained by the costume director)
(side note: Knitters I know want to have some of those lovely knit shawls, gloves....must we wait for the patterns?)
Interesting sword and, medical, and herbal information for the time periods.
All in all, I could go on .....It is an incredibly beautiful film and the story is riveting!  Highly recommended.  Not for children and there are
screen warnings.",1461715200,2,2293,4.856410256410256

The only show I've seen Starz do well so far is Black Sails - and it had a lot of similar stylistic issues (and a lot of gratuitous sex and cursing - I have no problem with and even enjoy a good sex scene and a well-placed F-bomb, but it was a bit ridiculous) in the first season, but had some good characters and much better filming.

6538059,1,B00M0GMC26,"I am not familiar with the Outlander books, but saw so many promotional pieces and interviews, and read so many positive reviews that I was very interested to see it.  I watched the first 2 episodes then many weeks later 2 more, and binge watched 6 on and off in one day.  The filming and location were beautiful, almost dreamlike.  The music mesmerizing and the costumes extremely detailed and intricate.  Definitely, a carefully thought out production to the minutest detail.  The actors peformed exceptionally in the dramatic scenes, conveying the strongest emotions and excitement.  But even with all these attributes, I cannot justify watching it, and will not go any further in the series.  Art is intertwined in life, but there are boundaries when it no longer resembles art, but becomes dark and gratuitous.  When writers and directors graphically depict the most heinous crimes and sexual details, proclaiming it necessary for the story, they are really feeding their desires to be outrageous and contretemps.  They have tremendous talent, but reduce it to rubbish, using profanity, vulgarity, and torture in their scripts, painstakingly convincing themselves that it is art.  I am sorry for them, for the actors, and for the fans who have bought into this deception.  The professed success of a book or tv series, measured by the writers, producers, directors, actors, and fans involved is a biased opinion.  The Outlander tv series had all the elements to be amazing, but added in so much disturbing, irreverent, graphic material, it destroyed itself.  There is more than enough violence and sexual dysfunction in the world, now and throughout history.  Presenting it as artistic form does not change the reality of what it is.  It always must be rejected in reality and fiction, and overcome with virtue and industry, in real life and art.",1461196800,40,1851,5.082781456953643

It can be a bit slow in certain spots, but you realize that things are being put into motion that will come back later in a big way.  This is also a rather erotic series, which is a nice surprise.  The love scenes are well done and not gratuitous.  Caitriona Balfe is easy on the eyes.

6538660,2,B00M0GMC26,"An interesting premise, but from the 5th episode or so on, I was in ""Give it one more shot"" mode for a while, and I finally gave up on the show.  One episode in particular finally killed it for me because the character actions were blatantly motivated by plot needs rather than logical character motives.  One other negative for me (and I never thought I'd complain about this) was the sheer quantity of nudity.  No one likes looking at a beautiful woman more than me, but there is a point where the amount of nudity is so great it just takes you out of the scene.

It started to feel like a crutch for the show that whenever things got slow or something didn't make sense, it would be ""get naked"" time.  That an the overall slowness of the plot.  It plods along at fairly to slow pace.  And maybe it takes a women's perspective to appreciate him, but the male lead, the Scottish guy, his limited acting range really started to show.  He's basically the cover of a Romance novel, and he does a good job of being sexy I guess, but being a well-rounded character, I just wasn't buying it.  But then again, maybe it was the script that was the problem.  His character wasn't particularly well written, and the same could be said for the English officer.  He seemed to exist to solely be evil.  I didn't buy into his character at all.  It all fell plot driven and one-dimensional.

Maybe the show picks up when she magically travels somewhere else, but I frankly got tired of waiting.",1461024000,,1480,4.413284132841328

I have no time for that. I was actually bored. My Mom was watching with me for part of it and even tho the shows action was moving it was boring. I can't explain it. Again I didn't read the books. I had read that this was a racy sexy chemistry filled show. I love ""Reign"" and ""The Tudors"" , ""The Other Bolyan Girl"" so though t I would love this as much as all the reviewers did. What a let down. I forced myself to watch up to Wedding and into volume two, but now that I'm back on my feet I will probably donate it to the Library. please let me know what I am missing.

Hold on ... I know what you're thinking but that's not what I mean. They tell some of the stories backwards. like the wedding episode.

Totally confusing and frustrating. I'm sure those that created the episodes don't think it is confusing but to some of us that don't realize it is backwards, are left confused.

Some scenes appear to be out of place in the storyline (timewise). It's like they need to explain something so they just toss a scene into the mix but it is all wrong ... timewise.

Great story, great acting but not very well strung together.",1461024000,,679,4.451612903225806
6539414,5,B00M0GMC26,"I was sceptical about the casting of Jamie and Claire when i heard about the series. I figured plastic surgery enhanced Hollywood types would get the roles. I was so happy and suprised about the casting of both roles. Claire is  intelligent,skilled and beautiful, but in a real way. During the seminude scenes i was pleasantly suprised that the actress playing Claire had real, not overly large breasts. Unlike the perfect surgical breasts so many women have today. The actor playing Jamie is charming and handsome. I love how sexually Claire is the experienced one, and Jamie a virgin. This is the opposite if every romantic novel i have read, with the sweet,innocent girl and the tough, experienced man who takes her virginity. I love how the whole scenerio is switched with Jamie and Claire. Finally i loved the books and the series. One minor issue is i watched it last night as my 14 year old son did his homework. He said he couldn't concentrate  due to the numerous sex scenes. I guess Europe is a bit different than the USA.",1461024000,,1032,4.664835164835165

The sex scenes get annoying, and the constant threat of rape is horrible.  There is even talk of one character preferring farm animals over women! The acting is cheesy, and the story line is taking way too long.  Why don't they flash forward in time to Frank Randall in search of his wife?  By the second episode there must be an all out search into her disappearance.  Why aren't they showing that side of the story as well?  Why can't I get closed captioning on the Gaelic?

I can't recall any HBO show that had such an effect on me that I physically got sick in the stomach. I'm sure some people may think, wow that means the actors did a great job acting so I must watch it. Sadly that is not the issue. There are somethings in life that you can't take back after you've seen it because those images and feelings live in your mind forever. So please do yourself a favor and run like the dickens from this utterly disgusting vulgar series. Don't get fooled by the cover and the initial episodes as I was.
This series is ideal for people who were exposed to unmentionable horrors, like making other people miserable, and believe that wickedness and cruelty always prevails over good deeds/people.",1460073600,13,810,4.593103448275862

If you have not watched the 1st season you maybe lost if you start with the 2nd season.  My suggestion would be to wait and watch the 1st before beginning the 2nd.

I eagerly await the beginning of the 2nd season in a few days.

The first season had several powerful characters so hopefully some of them will appear at times in the 2nd season.

6539498,4,B00M0GMC26,"Geeze-Oh-Pete, people!! I just read the first two pages of 1-star reviews... they were all written by old women who spend their days in church and never even heard of Diana Gabaldon before watching the series. Yes it is graphic, but so is the book, and frankly, your imagination would probably be more provocative than the show. I love how half the old bitties are bashing the BBC for what they call pornography; I think Starz actually produced the show and the BBC just broadcast it in the UK (though I could be wrong). Not only that, but given some of the things I've stumbled across on public TV in the UK, you'd think they'd be more open-minded about sex scenes...

As an avid fan of the books, I'm not completely impressed with the show (they added a lot of things that don't contribute to to the story and left out some of my favorite parts, and I haven't made up my mind about their chosen actress for Claire), but I generally enjoy watching. I'll probably fast-forward through the rape scene, though...",1459728000,3,1010,4.549450549450549

6539524,4,B00M0GMC26,"Ok.  Outlander.  I read the first book in the early 90's and immediately claimed it as my lifelong favorite book, where it sat uncontested until Harry Potter came about 6 years later, and it's been those two ever since.  And I read.  A lot.  Several books going at a time, all week, 52 weeks per year.  So when I heard that Outlander was being made into a saga on Starz, I figured it would be iffy..as no book that gets put on screen EVER lives up to what's in my head and heart.  I finally gave in and watched the first season as it's free on starz.com right now.
I was right, and I was wrong.  I was right in that while almost every character is so perfectly cast, it's now them I see in my head as opposed to what I imagined them to be with just the books under my belt.  Note that I said ""almost"".  Jamie.  I know this will cause an uprising of outrage..but I can't even with this guy.  Jamie in the books is a MAN.  Even as a very young man, he knew the weight of the world and while he wasn't a perfect man, he was all man.  This Jamie on the show is petulant, immature at times & doesn't EVEN come close to being Jamie if you go by the description in the books.  Jamie in the books is tall, broad, has a roman nose and cheekbones.  You're telling me that in all of Scotland there's not a hot, big, manly young actor with naturally red hair?  The TV Jamie may be my Jamie's younger cousin.  A nephew.  But he's not Jamie.  (I'm sure this young Sam fellow is lovely...keep your knickers on) I keep waiting for Claire to wise up and go find someone better.
That being said, Claire is fabulous.  The other characters are wonderful, rich and well rounded.  Black Jack Randall is the vile predator he is in the books, worse, even.  The scenery...OHMYGOD.  The history is riveting and the language beautiful.  If I didn't mind dying of one of the plagues or from starvation, I'd find some standing stones myself and live there forever.",1459555200,,1935,4.221311475409836

6539676,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is hands-down one of the best series I have ever experienced.  I use the term 'experienced' because, quite literally, I was totally immersed in it.  Yes, the main characters are fascinating and everything you could want in a hero and heroine;  but the secondary characters are also very intriguing and well-developed.  You can't just focus on the main characters and get the full effect of the story.  You must pay attention, and that's what I enjoy the most about this series and the expertise by which it was done.  The attention to detail is second-to-none.  The raw emotion is so realistic and gives you a true-sense of the bond between the main characters, as well as the bond between clansmen and their 'cause'.  I have, and will continue, to watch this series over and over again.  I'm very excited about the new series that is soon to begin.  Thank you immensely to Ms. Gabaldon for her wonderful books and to Mr Moore for the excellent job of bringing then to life!",1459209600,2,979,4.6395348837209305

6539682,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is very well done.  More involved with history than time travel or fantasy.  The detail, language, clothes, costumes, filth and smells seem accurately represented.  I loved the early books by Gabaldon and this is just as good...maybe better.  The romance between the leads is well handled....tho lots of nudity.  All the actors, even those in smaller roles completely embody their characters.  A big thumbs up!",1459209600,,415,5.212121212121212

6539691,5,B00M0GMC26,Loved the first volume...the end of the second volume is way too dark and involves some pretty graphic/highly disturbing scenes. I'm not sure that I will continue with this series because of it.,1459209600,,194,4.909090909090909

6539733,4,B00M0GMC26,"The casting and acting are very good, but having read the books, I feel too much has been left out and/or emphasized in a way that is different and to my mind inferior to the source material.  Claire in the series is too shrill and modern and Jamie is not as well rounded and less accomplished as the author has written him.  I understand the need to beef up the role of Frank and Murtagh in the series, but it seems to leave less room for the burgeoning of the relationship between the 2 main characters, Claire and Jamie.  I think the story as viewed on TV without the background of the books is fine although less rich and nuanced than the original writing.  I guess this is where I find the written word more evocative and fulfilling that the visual medium at least so far as telling a complex story.",1459209600,,804,4.304635761589404

6539781,5,B00M0GMC26,"This series is fantastic.  The attention to detail is amazing.  The landscapes and costumes are exactly how I pictured then when I first read the book, Outlander.  Claire and Jamie's chemistry on scene is steamy and electric.

Like all adaptations, they cut out sections of the book or switched characters to avoid adding too many minor characters.

You will not be disappointed if you watch this series.",1459209600,,404,4.970149253731344

6539820,5,B00M0GMC26,"Outlander is a great adult tv show. The show is done great with actors, scenes, and of course great footage from Scotland. It does follow the books closely. Even when they add scenes, they aren't so out of line with the book that it either enhances the show or explains more for you. I do, however, would have liked to have seen more flirtation between Jamie and Claire. Maybe we'll see their relationship flourish and grow more in the next season. If you are an adult, and would like to watch an awesome and wonderful show. This is the one.",1459209600,,541,4.42

6539852,5,B00M0GMC26,"I'm reviewing this after watching season 1 volume 2, which is good as it gives me more context.

Season 1 volume 1 is very true to the story in the book and very well done in my opinion. The acting is spot on, and the actors are very similar to what I was expecting.  The sets and scenery are also well done. And the sometimes heavy digital editing is pretty seamless.

Volume 2 starts to stray from the story line quite a bit, and I'm guessing that at least a couple of the actors must be from the porn industry (or had some training).",1459209600,,536,4.134615384615385

The story situations aren't quite so plainly contrived to be unwatchable, but as a regular guy (non-chick-flick type) I have a little trouble keeping from finding that distracting.  That said; it's well worth watching if you like this jondra.

The time-travel concept is cool, as are all the re-creations of a fantastic old world.  I also love the history aspect of catching a glimpse of what life and values must have been like back then.",1459209600,,491,4.809523809523809

I have found that the series is going along with the book great. The characters in the TV series is perfect for the part. The series is almost as good as the book. That I saying a lot, because I love the books. Each of the books are quite long. I am now wanting to go back to reread them. In April Volume two of the series is to begin.

These shows will give you a sense of how things look, sound, smell even, and much more in the Scottish Highlands in the 1770s. The casting is spot on. It's easy to get pulled into this fascinating world because these characters feel so real.

6540197,2,B00M0GMC26,"Be warned!! I bought this series recently thinking it would be exciting and beautiful with the Scotish Highlands.  I was not prepared however for the amount of sexual content.  There is a lot of complete nudity and sexual intercourse. There was also several rape scenes which I did not appreciate.  So if you want to buy it, be forwarded.  It is beyond R rated.  I ended up throwing it in the trash which was too bad because the acting and other scenes and locations were very nice. I hate it when they go too far trying to reach a sexual appetite rather than trust good writing and acting.",1458864000,,590,4.425925925925926
6540198,5,B00M0GMC26,"Outlander has become the favorite of many fans.  The story and the history of the times is well presented.

6540201,2,B00M0GMC26,Too expensive!!  The next series is even more expensive!  There are many options for TV entertainment.  Paying almost $25 is not one of them!,1458604800,,141,4.791666666666667
6540202,5,B00M0GMC26,I'm a little behind the times since I don't get the Starz channel but I watched this entire 2 disc set over the weekend and loved every minute of it. I have ordered Volume Two and can't wait for it to arrive!,1458604800,,208,3.9761904761904763
6540203,5,B00M0GMC26,So romantic and engaging. This is a story of time travel. One womans life and her struggle between two different eras. I started to read the best selling books but had a tough time with them because of the slang. These books were written in the UK. I knew they were good but didn't realize how good until I watched the series. I just binged on it. It is amazing.,1458518400,,362,4.185714285714286
6540204,4,B00M0GMC26,"This movie is pretty good. I've read all of the books twice. It's like Cliff Notes, a quicker version of Diana's writing. Sometimes I found her books to  go on and on and say little to nothing and took forever to get to the point and I had to refer back to see exactly what that point was. I love the whole idea of her series, it's romantic, historical and interesting.",1458518400,,369,4.197183098591549
6540205,5,B00M0GMC26,I'm on the 3rd book and I have to say this first season followed the first book incredibly well.  It even captured the interest of my husband.  It is amazing how they bring the story to life.  It was well cast and the scenery and trip they take the audience on is well worth it!,1458518400,,278,4.0181818181818185

6540229,5,B00M0GMC26,Follows the books very well and when it strays it doesn't diminish the storyline. I've been waiting a long time for an adaptation on screen (big or small) of this series so I'm in heaven.,1458345600,,187,4.371428571428571

6540232,4,B00M0GMC26,"One thing that I do not understand about these series is when the dvd's come out why do they split the volumes up between two different sets of discs? It took me a little bit to figure this out after looking at the cover because it says Season One: Volume One on the first set and then Season One: Volume Two: which means that there are a total of 4 discs in the entire first season, so why not just wait and sell them as an entire 4 disc set or release it as such unless they're doing it in order to make extra money? This is a strange process indeed, it's almost like that excellent series entitled and called Ancient Aliens that I am still a fan of certain disc sets of. It is weird as to how they do these things.

Why do you need an application for employment when you have a resume, Doh? Or am I just being stupid for the sake of being stupid, as if the other person doesn't realize that I have any brains in my brain cavity? And yes, sometimes I just feel like I want to be ridiculous for the sake of being ridiculous.",1458259200,,1025,4.0492610837438425

6540235,2,B00M0GMC26,"Writing is OK - the pricing - 1/2 season for 8 episodes - is too much cost for too little content. They broke is into season ""101"" & ""102"" to be able to charge 2x's the price.  Feels like the baggage charges the airlines started 10 years ago to gouge  a person.

6540247,5,B00M0GMC26,"What a rip snorter! This is great fun.  The tale of disloyalty to the Crown made gruesome by honest to goodness British oppression is one that resonates with the mayhem from which the world suffers today.  As well, the acting is good; and it is even.  None of the cast lets down any of the others.  Sets, costumes, scenery, music--ah, the music--do Diana G's novels proud.  In fact, the novels can be a bit leaden at times but that is not the case with the film.",1458086400,,462,4.325581395348837

6540251,2,B00M0GMC26,"The premise is great. The scenery is gorgeous! The acting is wonderful, as is the directing and the production. So why is this a 2 star review? Because all of that is great - otherwise it would only be one star. I do not consider myself a prude, but the sex scenes leave almost nothing to the imagination. And anyone discovering this series or watching the film adaptation of their favorite books will surely bring with them an already active imagination. The sex detracts from everything good about the series because it is gratuitous. It serves little to no narrative purpose. It seems it is only in place to capture the prurient interest of otherwise un-invested viewers. Sadly, I have had to quit watching the series (Starz subscription, also cancelled) because I cannot rationalize willingly consuming pornography, even when the acting and everything else recommends it.",1458086400,3,875,5.0

6540282,3,B00M0GMC26,I have been hearing really good things about this show and prior to purchasing the entire season for $30 I decided to purchase episode one to preview it. I found the episode to be a bit slow. It did not fully capture my attention and I kept doing other things while it was on. With that being said I thought the acting was really good and I understand that the episode was setting up the whole season. However I did not find it compelling enough to spend the $30 for the entire season.,1458000000,,485,4.225806451612903

I had originally been deciding between the two shows and went with poldark. but boy was I in for a surprise when I watched this show! I love it even more. its sexy, smart, stunning landscapes, characters and keeps you on your toes. The best part are the two main protagonists Jamie and Claire. Could not have picked two actors better to play the parts. 10/10, a definite MUST see!",1457740800,,473,4.576470588235294

6540351,5,B00M0GMC26,"In a series like this there's always enough time to focus on character development and plot with one adventurous escapade after another. In addition a great amount of attention is given to detail in every way including costumes, landscapes and everything else in between. Then for modern audiences there's the occasional graphic nudity and sex as an effective lure.

Personally I had no problems with any of it except had to fast forward through any torture or sodomy scenes, but the story is about a 1945 war nurse getting magically transported back into the Scottish 19th century, followed by her trials, tribulations and conundrums. The main character really comes off as a 21st century emancipated female liberationist who is perpetually offended by the way she's treated back in those old days.

Within it's genre as an action-fantasy film almost anything goes so from this perspective I found it all to be very entertaining. The acting is very good and the story line mostly flows smoothly without losing track of what's happening with too many side shows. Numerous outstanding character actors fill in throughout and there's never a feeling this series is done on a budget. The scenery and landscapes are always a treat to see.

Because of certain scenes and much realism with regards to intimacy and violence it would undoubtedly get an 'R' rating in the US in case some are wondering if their children should be watching.",1457654400,,1430,4.97489539748954

6540439,1,B00M0GMC26,"If you know anything about the history of the U.S. Bill of Rights and its antecedent 1689 English Bill of Rights, this show looks like political propaganda against these rights and Anglo-Saxon laws of consent and rights of the child concepts.  This propaganda appears to be based in Catholic ideology.  The author is not just doing this via her books; she has given interviews where this political agenda becomes clear.

These English and British American colonial (north of Mason-Dixon) rights (based in ""person"" not ""man"") were huge advancements for women and particularly for children; the author's agenda against them is curious; the only reason I can think for this is that she does not want to take adult responsibility and wants to prevent other women from doing so as well.

This is a very elaborate bodice-ripper that creates a false type of female ""empowerment"" that prevents women having to take responsibility for themselves.  It is a very primitive sexuality that lacks the type of interaction that forms the basis of more adult, interactive sustainable sexual relationships.  Most importantly, it crushes the rights of the child under the childlike behavior of Jamie and Claire.

I am a lawyer and the garbling of legal history is appalling. The author takes the side of the Highlander Scots who supported the Jacobite cause; the Highlander Scots were a minority of Scots to begin with and the Jacobites and even further minority among them.  The author thus manages to stereotype Scots and glamorize the worst of them, while missing the best of them.

Also, the Glorious Revolution in 1689, which caused the documentation of the 1689 Bill of Rights, and which played a role in Bills of Rights north of Mason-Dixon in the British colonies were huge advancements in human rights.  The author sides against these.

The Kings George of Hanover, who succeeded to the throne after Mary II and William II's joint rule and then Queen Anne's rule, did follow a Holy Roman Empire law called the Salic Law, which required disinheritance and disenfranchisement of women, but they followed this only in Hanover; they couldn't follow it in England.  Although these Kings were Protestant, the Lutheran reforms did not repeal the Salic Law.  England had prevented the Salic Law ever operating in England, dating back to Magna Carta and before.  Scotland did as well; the only Scots who tried to prevent women exercising agency were this author's glorified Highlander Jacobites.

Today, the English have passed consent laws that require a man who is alleged to have raped a woman to show that the woman consented.  These laws apply to everyone (similar laws recently enacted in California apply only to teenagers, not adults).  Also, the English have laws that require both parents to be responsible for a child; it violates a child's rights for the parents not to be having consensual sex that creates the child.  Women thus cannot escape taking responsibility for their children by abdicating their adult responsibility to consent (or not consent); ""bodice-ripper"" sex is thus not allowed without prior consent.",1457136000,,3111,5.078585461689587

The main characters of Jamie and Claire are perfectly cast and their acting is high quality and compelling.

6540682,2,B00M0GMC26,"There is no way I would ever buy this at the current price. What the heck? Split the season in two and sell it twice? No way. I borrowed it from the library. Glad I did. It plays like a Harlequin romance. The dialog is unrealistic. It switches back and forth from the narrator to the actors, so it feels like a book. People talk like they are in a book. It's so silly, formulaic, and really choppy.

A modern day (1940s) woman drops into the 18th century and it's days before anybody says, ""Hey, woman! Why are you in your skivvies? Put some clothes on."" Nobody even says a word about her bare legs, bare head, or riding astride a horse. Okay... The historical inaccuracies of this piece are Out-landish. This chick arrives in underwear and when she finally gets some clothes, they fit perfectly. You never see her in the same clothes twice after that despite the fact that she has no money and is a guest there. She is a ""lady"" but she helps in the kitchen, acts as a nurse, mingles with commoners, and is out galavanting all over the countryside with a party of men. She ""has an interest in botany"" and is able to parlay that into herbalist skills. Riiiiggghhhttt. I get suspending reality, but this is ridiculous. Details matter in a historical drama.

As for the plot, the story is the typical Harlequin plain-Jane-meets-hot (?)-guy-and-wants-to-hate-him, but-she-can't story. Yuck. You can even predict when the sappy music will come on. I got over that when I was 12. I don't see what all the fuss is about. Truly. A good Harlequin makes you want to be the heroine or at least want to be with her man. Claire, the lead female, is so contrived that she doesn't seem like a real person. Who could identify with her? The lead male is kinda cheesy. In fact all the guys are dirty and gross. What's worse is that the couple have zero chemistry. She looks a million years older than he is. I just don't get it.

The scenery is gorgeous, but really it has very little to offer otherwise. Very unoriginal. By the end of it, I was at ""So what."" Not only would I not buy volume 2 at the price they are asking, I am not even interested in borrowing it free from the library.",1455062400,,2169,4.390547263681592

6540692,5,B00M0GMC26,"This mini-series is based on the books by the same name written by Diana Gabaldon.  I've not read the books, but I do remember them being real popular among my friends.  So, when my Mother and I started watching this series, we didn't know the plot and I have to say, it is an ingeniously clever one.  It features a British lady after WWII falling through a time warp into the Highlands of Scotland.  She barely escapes several rape attempts by her husband's ancestor and falls in with the MacKenzie clan.  Having been a nurse during WWII, she becomes a healer in this time period and is highly regarded for her skills.  Unfortunately, for her, she's so highly regarded that she never gets a chance to return to the stones where she fell through time and try to return to her era.  Through a series of coincidences she ends up having to marry one of the Highlanders and my, oh my, he is very romantically and masculinely portrayed by an actual Scottish actor.  And this Jamie Fraser highlander is definitely swoon worthy material throughout the series.  My Mother said the series borders on the soft porn genre with their very detailed and graphic scenes of intimacy.  And I have to agree, I found myself using the fast forward button several times.  So, while I do recommend this series highly, I do also recommend having your fast forward button handy!",1454889600,,1354,4.623430962343096

season 1, or most of it, I'm appalled that there is so little of this information in the series of her role as healer.
What's highlighted more is the horrid way women are treated.  Every single episode from the very first one, has rape, threatened rape, a man demonstrating power over by holding a person against their will.  All choices are dictated to her, not something she can get out of or choose for herself.  Therefore, I would not recommend this series to trauma survivors.  All they are trying to bring forth in this show is superseded by the violence.  The show has great potential, but the rape scenes in every episode absolutely ruin it.",1454630400,18,759,4.5851851851851855

The Gaelic doesn't need to be subtitled - don't get me wrong, part of the experience is not knowing what the Scots are talking about - but I am of the opinion that the actual English captions, meant to display the English that they are speaking, so that an English-speaking audience can follow the sometimes-hard-to-decipher British accents - should be consistent and legible. Often times I could understand what they were saying but there were no words on the screen. Even though the the dialogue was really important to the story and also very hard to decipher (as an American). But even worse!: sometimes you can see the captioning flash on to the screen, only to disappear in a quarter of a second! So some poor worker actually spent a lot of time typing out (copying and pasting if they are lucky) what the dialogue is, went through the trouble of producing the captions, only to have those captions disappear before they are useful! This is unacceptable. Good show though. Turns from graphically violent to soft-core porn on a dime.",1454112000,,1131,4.895833333333333

The great story, acting, directing, historic authenticity and haunting music all work together to take us to another world.

Ron Moore (Battlestar Galactica fame) and company have produced this wonderful series keeping strictly to the story line.  Terry Dresbach, costume designer, has kept the costumes as authentic as possible, and there is no detail left out in the scenes.  (EX: real food in the castle kitchen making this even more believable.)  The characters and actors (Caitriona Balfe, Sam Hueghan, Tobias Menzies, et al) who play them are perfect for their parts.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this DVD.  I would give it 10 stars, if possible!  TREAT YOURSELF!

Scotland is a beautiful country with an interesting heritage however, there seems to be a shortage of both of those in favor of showing bare chested women and sexual encounters.  All of the actors do a great job and the costuming and set are good but it is a struggle to connect with the main characters. They aren't very sympathetic or developed well.

Then there are fake Scottish accents, the fact that the heroine constantly appears in brand new clean clothes but you have no idea where they come from and how she could afford them).

6540987,1,B00M0GMC26,"While thiis story is full of intrigue and fasciniation, in particular with the association of a time period of great interest and coupled with the mystery of the mostly unknown religons of those who erected the standing stones of Stonehenge and the ficticesou Craid n dun, I am disguested and sorely disappointed at how this story was protrayed. Indeed, it was not about the topic of time travel to the highlands, but was a sick display of the perversed people who produced this series and should be called nothing less than the basest of pornography. Indeed, the producers (and BBC themselves) showed just how sick they are in the protrayal of Jack Randall and indeed, I venture they are no better than their character. This misuse of quality British actors (and the fact these actors actually agreed to play these roles) represents an extreme low in the BBC's long-time and well earned acclaimed institution and as such, I will never watch a BBC series with the same expectation and joy that I have before now.  The producers and all the viewers out there who actually liked watching this should be ashamed at using one of the most interesting topics to many of us as a avenue to disply your vile perversions.  While I endured all the episodes, I was sick as Clair herself in the last episode as I fast-forwarded though 2/3 of the show. The writers successfully hoooked me into the shows, again, a topic I am most interested in: the Scots of the 1700's, the mystery of standing stones throughout Great Britian and love.  However, I am sicked and irrate that these themes were taken from me in this series to be replaced by the sick minds of the producers and the need to show the world how they are entiteld to share it with us all. I will not watch Season 3 and am glad to say Series 1 and 2 are safety where they shoudl be: at the bottom of my trash can.",1452384000,17,1858,4.507418397626113

6541013,2,B00M0GMC26,"Let's start with the good stuff:

Scotland is a beautiful country, and the camera team has done a great job showing off its spare, wild landscape to good effect.

The costume and casting teams also deserve accolades for doing a good job imagining and recreating a decent facsimile of 1740's Scotland, and also of the old time Scotsmen. The use of Scots Gaelic is a nice extra touch in the show.

..and author Diane Gabaldon did come up with an interesting twist on the fantasy time-traveling genre.

However, the frequency with which the heroine is compelled by the script writers to act in such a way as to fly herself headlong  'right in to the danger zone' is ridiculous. By my estimate, Claire's virtue comes under serious threat an average of 2.47 times per episode. Most of the rest of her time is spent being angry with Beefcake Beau, and then having make-up sex with him.

Then there is the torture.... and the spankings...and finally, overshadowing all else, there is the ever-lurking tumescent menace that is Captain Black Jack Randall himself.

Having finished all eight episodes of Sassenach, I have now become sensitized to every would-be bucolic meadow scene, every tall stone on a hillside, every window, every door, and every chimney, half expecting to see old Black Jack  jumping out onto the screen at any moment, with his swords, knives, whips, pistols as well as his other weapon drawn and ready, striking terror into the hearts of every man, woman, and sheep in sight.",1451520000,16,1489,4.811764705882353

And to dream requires a certain suspension of disbelief. But it takes a lot  of suspending when your female lead goes back in time the the 18th and strikes airs that would not have been acceptable in 1940s England, let alone the brae Hielands, where such talk could have her beaten or burnt.  Traditionally, heroes and heroines are supposed to show great resourcefulness or courage. CBRF mainly shows lip. There is a difference.  But sass(and sauce)  is what Diane Gabaldon served in her Outlander books and apparently is what her audience (huge) wants.

Production values are handsome, with Downton period dignity and GOT grit. But grand castles and a wee bit o' mud on your skirt do not make up for the lack of literary or psychological depth.",1451260800,3,871,4.684210526315789

While they may have been described in the book, which I read several years ago, having them actually on the screen was a bit much.  Many of the sex, torture and rape scenes could have been shorten and lessen in their graphic detail. I truly got tired of seeing Caitriona Balfe's back side and bosom.  Also, I object to how the DVD company is exploiting customers by having only four episodes on one disc so that season one is a two volume set that must be purchased separately at 22.00 each--(Best Buy).  This is just sheer extortion for those who may want to purchase the DVD--I no longer do.

We are human beings and sex is one of our most primitive drives. I do agree that in some shows and formats sex overtakes the story line. I don't think that is the case here.

If you like that, you might like this.  I've read a couple reviews that said that it was very changed from the novels.  The production values are good, the acting's ok, Tobias Menzies as ""that evil english guy"" is good but the rest of the characters were too horrible for me, especially the protagonist. Practically every male character wants to screw her instantly, because of her weirdly soft skin or something ridiculous like that, and she's apparently so ""fiery"" or ""independent"" or ""headstrong"" or some other adjective (or just plain stupid) that she can never keep her mouth shut, which seems a cheap way to create opportunities for conflict.

NO SPOILERS
DISCLAIMER: show watcher only

Overall, I liked it. The acting was really good and it's an interesting premise and it's a setting I don't know a lot about. When it comes to the writing, there are things to like, but then there are times I'm left either yelling at the screen or scratching my head. Sometimes I wanted to gag Claire and leave her tied to a tree.

PROS
- Well acted! Everyone!
- We get to see some interesting natural and historical locations. (I didn't know they had forests!)
- Much of the dialog is in Gaelic. I've no idea if it's well spoken, but it's fascinating to hear a tongue one does not hear in the US.
- The historical premise is super interesting.
- The dynamics/relationships between the different characters is also interesting.
- More Jenny, Ned, and Mrs Fitzgibbons, please!
- Ronald Moore & Co at the helm.

CONS
- The opportunity to explore the 'culture clash' from time travel was barely addressed or explored. A major opportunity lost.
- Inconsistencies with one of the main characters, meaning they acted in a way that was not consistent with how they were portrayed til that point.
- The reasons behind Claire's Big-Pivotal-Moment-Choice was not clear.
- Claire's motivation in an important friendship is not clear.
- If you prefer understatement and restraint in your romances, you're likely to find this show kinda schmaltzy.

NOT CON OF THE SHOW, JUST PERSONAL TASTE
- Claire can be very unlikable *at times*. She is a stranger in a strange land and in a very precarious situation. Most people would tread carefully. Sure they'd make mistakes but it'd be the result of trying to navigate the new world. Claire doesn't seem to navigate. She's a tornado.  Claire has a habit of acting or opening her mouth without thinking first. She doesn't seem to learn.",1449964800,6,1840,4.719626168224299

The other inaccuracies I can deal with but this one is just wrong.  Where, in the 1700s would Clair find these pants that fit her so well.  Also wouldn't everyone be very shocked by a woman dressing this way?  It messed up the second season.  I hope the third season make more sense.",1449187200,5,481,4.173913043478261

6541256,5,B00M0GMC26,"Diana Gabaldon has been my favorite author since 2001 when I was stuck at home all winter with a broken tib/fib and discovered her series. I was reluctant at first to watch the show since I had read the series at least five times, and had an image in my mind of what the characters should be like. It was much better than I thought it would be. It does try to be historically accurate. They have Tweaked the plot a little bit which I can understand since the books are quite long. I thought the casting was very good for the most part. At first I didn't think Sam was a good choice for Jamie, but after watching a few episodes he actually became Jamie to me!  As far as Catriona playing Claire it took a whole season for me to warm up to her. She is beautiful, but physically Claire is supposed to be fairly voluptuous, and Catriona is very thin. Also Jamie is supposed to be at least a head taller than Claire and these actors are about the same height. It only matters because Jamie being so BIG is one of the things that is mentioned in the series repeatedly. The actor playing Frank is not as physically handsome as I thought Frank should be. He is a good actor in the sense that he plays the sadistic Jonathan Wolverton Randall with cold blooded ease. When he was acting as Frank, Claire's first husband I did not feel there was any chemistry whatsoever between those two characters. The other supporting characters were wonderful. They did look something like I imagined they would, especially Mrs. Fitzgibbons, Dougal and Colum Mackenzie and the ever loyal Murtaugh.",1448236800,2,1573,4.461805555555555

6541258,5,B00M0GMC26,"TV series reviews really aren't my thing so you might be wondering what the heck is going on! Well, I had never intended to become invested in the Outlander series. The books are all way more massive than anything I'd commit to. Instead, I decided to watch the show. It looked pretty good and I thought it would be a good substitution for the book series. I actually attempted to watch Outlander last year when it was still fairly new. But halfway through the first episode I was so bored I thought I might fall asleep! I toughed out episode one and didn't go back for episode two. I know this doesn't sound good for the series, but please bear with me!

A few weeks ago I found myself with nothing to watch. I had caught up with all my regular shows and had resorted to watching Ink Master on Hulu. (Don't judge me). It was only then that I remembered I had season one of Outlander waiting on me... I started with episode two because, honestly, I have to hold to the opinion that episode one was terribly boring. It definitely got better moving forward though, which caused me to binge it over a couple weeks!

To start with I thought that a time travel story would be downright ridiculous. I expected Outlander to be a shameless soap opera with a ton of gratuitous sex. I was somewhat right about the sex, to be sure, but I didn't expect that the rest of the story would be as in depth and heart wrenching as it was. Outlander is a beautiful show in a lot of ways. The music is enchanting and the landscapes of the Scottish Highlands (I'm assuming it was actually filmed there) are breathtakingly beautiful! The characters are (mostly) easy to love and sympathize with and I'm not out to fool anyone - Sam Heughan is definitely not difficult to look at. Honestly, I fell completely in love with Claire, Jamie, and their story. Captain Jack Randall is probably the most despicable villain I have ever had the displeasure of encountering in any medium, which I suppose is a job well done.

Despite all the things I loved about this show, I do feel that I should give fair warning about its content. Outlander has its fair share of sex, nudity, rape, and murder, and general violence, but it's pretty mild on language (there's a reason it's been called the feminist GoT). Not much bothers me in the TV/movie world, but there were a couple scenes of violence in this show that made me feel a bit queasy and I'm guessing that some people might find themselves having to divert their gaze. Still, all of these things lend an air of authenticity to a show depicting a 20th century woman thrown into 18th century Scotland during a time of unrest and I wouldn't let these a little sex and violence keep you from experiencing such an amazing story!

Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) I fell completely in love with Outlander. Season one is a complete adaptation of the first book and I have now had to start book two in the series. I had no choice, really, since season two of the show isn't scheduled for release until sometime next Spring. Because I'm picking up the series with book two and will not be reviewing book one, I thought a season one review was in order! So there you have it. Outlander is completely amazing and I totally love it, despite my attempts not to. This is a show that is definitely worth your time!",1448236800,,3322,4.467874794069193

actually speaking Celtic.  This is a very well acted drama that takes place both in the 1700's and the 1940's.  I especially enjoyed the chemistry
between the lead actors Catriana Balfe and Sam Heughan.  Tobias Menzies place a sadistic  English captain brilliantly.  Any viewer
will easily get behing the idea of completely disliking him.

6541406,4,B00M0GMC26,"It's fun to see the differences of this TV production with the books, such as the integration of Claire's experiences back home more intimately integrated with those in the olden days: Her visit to the castle with Frank intermingled with her visit to the same areas with Colum for example. It's fun to see it all laid out visually as a way of revisiting the pleasure of reading it. The atmosphere is appropriately daunting: I love that they have made it sloppy underfoot and dank inside. I also enjoy the language, use of the Gaelic, no unnecessary explanations to get in the way of the verisimilitude.

My only hesitation from making it 5 stars is that I expect it will yet plumb the depths to a greater degree. I have seen only 2 episodes as of this writing. I've read well beyond these episodes, so I have reason to hope. Or maybe it will be come more 'TV' and I'll stop watching. We'll see.

6541415,5,B00M0GMC26,"As a Gabaldon book fan for years, I was thrilled to hear her books were made into a mini-series. I was especially glad that it went to cable, as that meant the whole storyline could be addressed properly. The quality of the filming, the casting, the costumes and the characters are PERFECT. Though I envisioned the main characters differently, Caitriona, Sam and Tobias are forever Claire, Jaimie, Frank and Black Jack. And can I say that Tobias Menzies is utterly brilliant as both Frank and Black Jack Randall. His characterization of Black Jack is disturbingly and chillingly real. Duncan Lacroix is excellent as Murtagh, Graham McTavish as Dougal, Grant O'Rouke as Rupert, Stephen Walters as Angus (funny he is), Finn Den Hertog as Willie, Bill Paterson as Ned, Nell Hudson as Laoghaire (sounds like Leery) Gary Lewis as Colum, Lotte Verbeek as Geillis, Annette Badland as Mrs. Fitzgibbons, James Fleet as the Reverend, Laura Donnelly as Jenny, Steven Cree as Ian, Tim McInnery as Father Bain (loved him in Notting HIll) and Tracy Wilkinson as Mrs. Graham (loved the palm reading scene). For the most part I've never seen the majority of these actors before ""Outlander"", but I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of them in years to come. SUPERB QUALITY. Not for children. Thumbs up to Creator Ronald Moore. KUDOS to all who have made this series the quality entertainment that it is. Loved the guest scenes by DG. The only disappointment: Have to wait more than a YEAR for the second season. Oh well, I'll go back and watch it again. And again. And again.",1446076800,2,1553,4.798507462686567

Did an excellent job in picking the right people for each & every part, especially for Jamie & Claire. These two actors are new to me, but oh my, they are so good at bringing these two characters to life! Some of the things these characters have to go through on screen is deserving of an Emmy for both of them. They have such great chemistry. The show should be nominated as well.

Until, for no apparent reason, the director seems to think he is directing pornography. I've had to fast forward through much of the program- not because sex ""scares"" me. I just don't think it's necessary in intelligently written/produced television. This series is very well done. The scenery and costumes are gorgeous. The acting is splendid.

Halfway through the second episode, it was clear this film wasn't going to ever be about anything much.

6541493,4,B00M0GMC26,"This is a review for Season 101 and 102, which I purchased via Prime. I am a sucker for any semi-historical costume drama, especially if it features Scotland and braw Highlanders. Beautiful costuming. I found this to be a charming and compelling story, and a neat combination of sci-fi against a historical backdrop. Talented cast relays the story well. If you are an ADULT and enjoy a good adventure - action - romance, you may enjoy this. Despite the number of episodes, I felt it moved along very nicely. I am not familiar with the books and found the varying comments around the book series and author interesting, and may check those out.

In reading the other reviews, glad to know I am not the only one who found the graphic sex scenes and arbitrary nudity more than a bit much, and thank goodness for FFWD. I found this cheapened and reduced the quality of an otherwise beautifully done story. That's too bad, because it didn't need it and it would be nice to be able share this otherwise lovely work with a wider audience.",1445212800,2,1031,4.572972972972973
6541494,5,B00M0GMC26,"I bought this series and watched all of the episodes in two days.  I just couldn't stop...I enjoyed the books and was a bit worried about their adaption to screen, but they did a terrific job with this.  Its very realistic, very believable, and the characters are wonderfully complex.  The beautiful Scottish landscapes are also fabulous.  There are some scenes that are very hard to watch due to violence and this is not for someone who can't handle realistic filming of injury and death.  There are also some nude scenes that are tastefully done.

This is the story of Claire Randall, a nurse who is on her (belated) honeymoon with her husband, Frank, after the conclusion of WW2.  They are travelling in Scotland where Frank is exploring his ancestry, particularly a British officer of the 1700's.  They sneak out on Samhain to watch the local women dance around an ancient stone circle and then, when Claire goes back, she touches one of the stones and wakes up in Scotland of the 1700's where she is accused of being a spy for the British and is captured by the Mackenzie Clan.  Of course, she can't tell the truth because they would think she was either crazy or a witch.

Claire is saved from an attack by Jamie, a fugitive wanted by the British, and struggles with her growing love for him, all too aware that she has a husband waiting for her back in the 1940's and her need to find a way back to the standing stones and home.  At the same time, she becomes embroiled in the politics and troubles of the times, in particular the growing Jacobite Rebellion that she knows, from history, is doomed to end badly for Scotland and the Clans.  She also becomes trapped between her husband's ancestor and his desire to figure out the truth even if he has to torture it out of her, and the same man's horrible past history with Jamie.

A great series to watch and I can't wait to view the second part.",1445212800,,1902,4.494186046511628

6541544,5,B00M0GMC26,"I may be one of the world' biggest fans of Diana Gabaldan and her ""Outlander Series."" I have read all 8 books in this collection and have read the first 4 books at least 4 times over the years. These books are not ""chick lit books,"" as I know many men who are just as enthralled by them as I am. So to say that I was thrilled, at the very least, to know that the series, parts one and two, are now available on CD and on Amazon video, is an understatement. I viewed both seasons in 2 days. I was and am WOWED!!! If I could give this series a 10 star rating I would do so, rather then be limited to 5 stars.

In season 1 of the ""Outlander,""  (as in book one of the same title), the story begins right after WWII in Scotland. Claire Beecham Randall was a combat nurse in the World War II and served in the battlefields of France, particularly at a field hospital in Amiens. By 1943 she was a senior nurse, supervising junior nurses and orderlies. Her husband, Frank Randall, was in army intelligence as an officer with MI6 and served, primarily, in London, doing important government work. The couple spent a very brief time together before the war intruded on their lives. During the early years of their marriage, Claire worked as a nurse and Frank was a historian at Oxford and a member of the junior faculty there.

As the story opens, both in the novel and the TV series, we find Claire and Frank on a 2nd honeymoon of sorts. They are visiting Inverness, Scotland. The terrible war is over and Claire and Frank, reunited, decide to go on a second honeymoon in Scotland to reestablish their marriage, their relationship. It is 1945. The couple stays at a charming bed-and-breakfast in Inverness, a city in the Scottish Highlands situated near an ancient stone circle called Craigh na Dun. One morning, while collecting plant samples at the stone circle, Claire falls through the cleft in the main stone and is transported back in time to 1743. Upon moving away from the stone circle, Claire immediately runs into a battle between a group of local Highlanders, and British officers led by the sadistic Jonathan Wolverton Randall. Randall, who demonstrates an amazing physical similarity to his six-times great-grandson Frank, assaults Claire, but she is rescued by Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser, one of the Highlanders, who are cattle-raiding in the area. Clair, a very strong and clever woman, who has had to think quickly and to improvise as a war nurse, recognizes, after a few hours, that she is a long way and time from 1945 Inverness. Although in shock and frightened, she uses her medical training to help the injured Scotsman Jamie Fraser, a handsome young man, about 4 years younger than Claire. Claire's medical skills earn her a place at Castle Leoch, seat of the MacKenzie clan. Laird Colum MacKenzie is Jamie's uncle and learns of Claire's extraordinary healing skills. He makes her the official healer of Leoch, and a guest, but she is a veritable prisoner there. Clan members and leaders alike believe that she is a British spy. And Claire feels hopeless as she is not able to travel to the stones to try to return to her own time. Claire and Jamie grow close. While not divulging her time travel secret, she is able to talk easily with him. And then there is the fact that the braw highlander is not only a treat for for the eyes, but he is gentle, kind, an exceptional warrior, and has a great sense of humor. He also has an education provided by an excellent tutor when he was a lad. The two, despite the centuries which separate them, find much in common.

I do not want to provide any ""spoilers"" to those who are not familiar with the wonderful historical novel. There are some changes in the film, although the script stays close to the book's narrative. Let it suffice to write that the novel ""Outlander"" has provided me with an outstanding reading experience and still does. But the film version touched me more. The characters are perfectly cast. Jamie, played by Sam Heughan, is ideal for the part. A large, handsome and muscular man, everything he feels towards Claire: tenderness, friendship, lust, love, shows in his eyes, which are a beautiful blue. One can see that he is attracted to Claire almost immediately from the start of the film. In the beginning, there is a scene when the clan members who ""saved"" her from the ""Lobster Backs,"" has Claire tending Jamie's wounds. She begins to cry. She is no ninny, by any means, but the events of the last few days have totally overwhelmed her. As Jamie holds her and comforts her the look in his eyes says that there might be something more here than just a sexual attraction. I find Jamie/Sam Heughan to be a kinder, more expressive hero in the film that in the book - and I am very surprised by this. Claire, is played to perfection by Caitriona Balfe. The actress's Claire is beautiful, feisty, strong, wise in the ways of the world, even if the world she is visiting is not her own. Ms. Balfe truly makes this story her own and does so in a most captivating manner. Tobias Menzies  plays two different roles here, as Frank Randall, Claire's loving husband, and also as Frank's sadistic ancestor. Mr. Menzies role is very difficult as he has to play characters of opposite temperaments, sometimes in a single day of filming. Gary Lewis is an extremely wise & savvy Laird of the MacKenzie clan, although he is crippled and his brother, Dougal MacKenzie, (Graham McTavish ), must stand in for him as War Chief and as collector of the clan's rents. Dougal is an extremely strong and fascinating character. There is also much comic relief here -  Anghus Mhor, (Stephen Walters) and Rupert MacKenzie, (Grant O'Rourke) are very funny macho man  who, unhappily, perform their task of keeping an eye on Claire. Dear to my heart is the gruff Murtagh Fraser, (Duncan Lacroix), who is Jaimie's godfather. He obviously loves the young man dearly, in his own taciturn way. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent. I was taken back in time and fell in love, or hate, with many characters.

The 1st season of ""Outlander"" is made up of 16 episodes, one more enthralling than the next. Producers Ronald D. Moore, Jim Kohlberg, and David Brown did a wonderful job bringing this story to life.

Again, I feel a bit strange saying that I enjoyed the film more than the extraordinary book. Call me crazy. 10 Big STARS!!!

6541554,5,B00M0GMC26,"Great script--quite true to Gabaldon's original book with some necessary creative license taken, given that eight 50+ min. episodes needed to be crafted. Sumptuously filmed, I thought.  I had been worried about what Starz's first blockbuster TV series would look like but I love the writing and the development/arc of the main characters: Jamie, Claire & Frank, in particular. And I really liked how the sexual tension & crackling sensuality unfolded and then exploded on the screen (e.g., in episode 7) between the actors playing Jamie & Clair. Looking forward to the next series of episodes.",1444435200,,593,5.177083333333333

The actors really bring it all to life. There is a little bit of gruesomeness (Claire is a nurse in the first season), and lots of nudity and sex (fyi). I think they've done a fabulous job of filming the books and making the whole store seem so incredibly real and possible (it's a time travel).

6541569,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've been waiting about 25 years for my Outlander obsession to come to the screen.  This is beautifully casted and directed.  So much better than the version in my head, for the most part.  I was really put off with the casting of Claire at first, because the actress is none of the earthy, fleshy, rough and tough Claire I remember from the book.  However, its not bothering me as much now.",1444262400,,391,4.388888888888889
6541570,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've read all eight of the Outlander books but I must say that book one is my favorite.  The story is captivating and I found it difficult to put down. I've never liked time travel books but I decided to try this because of all the reviews I've read about the books and the TV show.  At times my heart was racing to see what happens next.  The book has approximately 1400 pages and I was never bored. Some of it was difficult to read because of the violence.  You will absolutely fall in love with Jamie and if you like a strong woman Claire is the one for you.

Frankly the books are way better and most of the shows/movies are so adapted that I'm almost always disappointed.  This series however,  is so closely related that I have the same enjoyment as I did reading it 10 years ago.  I'm always overjoyed when a new book comes out.

6541587,5,B00M0GMC26,"First of all, it's not necessary to have read the books to enjoy the TV show.  A friend recommended ""Outlander"" and loaned me her DVD for S1 V1 (which was missing the 2nd DVD).  I had never heard of ""Outlander"" nor did the story look interesting to me from the packaging. I watched the 1st DVD.  I loved it.  I wanted more.  I read the books.

The story, in the beginning, mostly takes place in the Scottish Highlands in 1742, a place and history that was totally unknown to me.  The Scottish Highlands, remote and stunningly beautiful, are feudal.  Clans have ruled for generations.  Men must know how to fight and use a knife and sword. Life is primitive yet gregarious and political smarts necessary for survival. The British are ruthless occupiers.  Claire, from the 20th century, has fallen thru the stones, a time travel portal to this time and place.  The stones themselves are surrounded by ancient pagan beliefs and rituals.

Claire was a nurse during WWII for eight years.  She is married to Frank, a history professor who himself served during the war in an intelligence position (from the books).  Claire is not meek or docile.  She is morally strong, courageous and quick-witted.

The cast is excellent.  The TV show brings to American audiences largely unknown and brilliant actors from the UK such as Sam Heughan, Tobias Menzies and Caitriona Balfre, as the leads, and supporting actors such as Graham McTavish, Gary Lewis, Stephen Walters, Duncan Lacroix, Grant O'Rourke and Bill Paterson.  Stephen Walters is especially fun to watch in his role as Angus Mhor, a minor role in the book, which was enlarged for the TV show because Stephen and Grant O'Rourke,, as Rupert Mackenzie, are so funny and play off each other so well.

The production values are lush, thanks to Ron Moore and his wife, Terry Dresbach.  The show was filmed in the Highlands in actual castles. The costumes are to die for.  I am a beginner sewer and I have such respect and regard for the quality of the costumes and the amount of work that went into each one.  Terry has a blog called  An 18th Century Life where you can learn more about the costuming.

Where else are you going to hear characters speak Gaelic, quote the poetry of John Donne, see how a kilt is worn (I never knew it wasn't sewn!), see how dyed wool is made color fast or see asthma treated with a pipe filled with thorn apple?",1444176000,2,2383,4.619047619047619

6541590,5,B00M0GMC26,Interesting concept about a woman whisked back in time in Scotland. Depicts life in Scotland and the feud with the British in I believe the 18th century.  Very entertaining.,1444176000,,173,4.9655172413793105

6541601,5,B00M0GMC26,"The movie so closely follows the book in parts but when it varies away from the book, I'm finding that the movie script is better.  Some times when I watch a movie, I find the movie itself is really good but not thrilled with the choice of actors.  In ""Outlander"" I love the choice of actors!  My sister tried to get me interested in this series and it worked.  I haven't subscribed to Starz but I did buy Season One-Volume One and Volume Two.  I'm looking forward to Season Two!!",1444176000,,480,4.288888888888889

I love history and this book somehow makes you feel as if you are actually there feeling, smelling and experiencing the 1700's.  Obviously, Diana did a lot of research for her books to make it historically accurate.  I'm now on book three and find it hard to put down as I did the previous two books.

6541652,4,B00M0GMC26,"All in all, this is a beautifully produced series -- script, acting, scenery, sets, costumes, music are all excellent (except the opening song, it doesn't quite cut it).  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the extremely graphic sex scenes.  I'm an older woman, and not a prude by any means, however, I mean... really??  I'm sure I'm not the only one that remembers a time when this sort of thing would have been rated 'X'.  I am not watching the show so as to feel like a voyeur in someone's bedroom. Having watched some of Game of Thrones, I gather these sorts of in-your-face sex scenes are becoming more common.  This aspect of the series is definitely not for me.  I would appreciate it if they would edit the series to tone down the sex scenes so I could watch it with my teenage children.  As it is, I would never do so.  Anyone else for a PG-13 version?  Oh, and should anyone think to come to the show's defense, saying they are only staying 'true to the book', I'm already aware, having read the series.  However, with a book, it's easy to thumb through the pages, instead of wading through the intimate details. (And yes, I do fast forward through the sex scenes... Just wish I didn't have to bother).  Is there no longer a market for romantic, sensuous films, that do not devolve into near-pornographic interactions between lovers?",1443484800,,1358,4.502040816326531

6541697,5,B00M0GMC26,"The Outllander TV series is absolutely captivating and addicting.  I read the first book and then I purchased season one, volume one and I love the tv series as much as the book.  The cast totally fits the characters that they portray.  Claire has the intelligence, sophistication, passion, and temperament as she does in the book.  And Jamie was cast perfectly in the role as the passionate, loyal, protective husband and warrior that he is.  The tv series follows the book so well which is a real plus because it is very frustrating when a tv series or movie strays so far from the book.  There is action, romance, history, and violence and that makes Outlander very exciting to watch.  Also, the cast is mostly from Scotland and the show is filmed on location so that viewers may enjoy the beauty of Scotland.  They speak in the Scottish dialect and in Gaelic which even further authenticates the story.
I was able to follow and understand the storyline better because I had read the book first, so I do recommend that.  I was disappointed that not all 16 episodes are on the one DVD, but that makes me very anxious for the arrival of volume two.  I loved the book, and I love the Outlander TV series. I am now reading the second book and I look forward to Season 2.",1443139200,2,1269,4.478260869565218

6541703,5,B00M0GMC26,I so enjoyed reading the books.  Each was so enjoyed and I didn't want to have to be interrupted to just do... something.  The selection of actors for every character was so well matched.  No easy challenge.  Having the author on board during the filming is a tribute to how the stories were followed.  I so enjoyed seeing the men in kilts but so got lost in the story of Claire and Jamie.  I look forward to watching this video many times.,1443139200,,440,4.304878048780488

Borders on pornography - and then I was told by someone else that it only gets worse in other episodes.  Also, the ""heroine"" had a habit of using the Lord's name in vain in an especially rude way.  Sad that this stuff is allowed on television -- and even sadder that so many people think it's okay to watch it.",1442534400,17,408,4.259740259740259

I was hesitant to watch the TV series, because I had firm mental images of my own of Jamie and Claire and the other characters and I didn't want them to be replaced by actual actors. But I kept hearing good things about the show, so I finally watched the first season and was hooked! I think the actors and producers and writers did an absolutely fantastic job of staying true to the novel while also adding great additional scenes involving Frank that are not in the book. I was thrilled by every episode of Season 1 and was almost in tears when I realized that Season 2 isn't out yet! I hope and pray that they will continue on through every book in the series for many seasons of the show!!",1442448000,,777,4.1866666666666665

6541843,1,B00M0GMC26,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER. After hearing so much positive feedback from fans of the series, I looked forward to viewing the DVD and was initially enthused. By the end of this first half of Season One, I was thoroughly disgusted and will watch no more. There is an underlying theme of rape and sexual brutality throughout, with male characters making such pronouncements as, ""She walked bow-legged for a month after I was done with her"" (that's a paraphrase, not an exact quote). There is also a very graphic scene where the villain whips the male protagonist with a cat-of-nine-tails and basically shreds his back into strips of hanging flesh. No human being could survive such a beating. This is a depiction of extreme brutality for what purpose? Shock? Desensitization? Proving how graphic the filmmakers can be? I don't get it. From reading reviews of the second volume of season one, I understand it gets even worse. Frankly, I'd give this series a negative rating if I could. That said, let me recommend the new 2015 version of Poldark. That's probably more of what you're looking for in a period romance of this type.",1441843200,25,1128,4.819587628865979

I did not read the description well enough and did not realize it was only one half of the season and I would need to order a second tape. Although I did pre-order the second half of the season, that DVD was twice the price. Reading the books now, and I know of one episode in the movie that  was not only shortened from what happened in the book, but Claire was made to seem really emotionally effected in a bad way. In the book, being accosted by runaway Red Coats was dealt with by Claire and Jamie in a really good way. Movies are often different in some ways and books are longer, but the story of Claire and Jamie should not drift too far from the original book. I will enjoy the rest of the DVD and continue the books until another season finishes and is offered on DVD. Much cheaper than subscribing to STARZ year round.",1441584000,2,876,4.214285714285714

A coworker suggested I order the books so I may try that as I can tell this is an awesome recommendation.  The scenery and time period authenticity is extremely impressive.

6541880,3,B00M0GMC26,"Good costumes and Scottish Highlands scenery, but a startling lapse or two in the editing. (Example: Transported back magically to 1743, Claire Randall confides her secret to motherly Mrs. Fitzgibbons at Leoch Castle. ""Mrs. Fitz"" reviles Claire as a witch, bidding her ""begone"" and making the sign of the cross. But in the very next scene, Mrs. Fitz is the soul of love and helpfulness. What??) Many script changes from the bestselling series of books by Diana Gabaldon, notes my wife, who has read 2 of the books (I've read none). The movie is, of course, a bodice-ripper and a chick flick -- which I like -- but is not on a high intellectual level. And then there's the basic premise of time travel. Claire shouldn't be worrying whether she will ever get back to the 20th Century. She MUST get back there, because if she dies in the 18th Century, she would never have been born in the 20th. So, relax, Claire, and happily cheat on your 20th Century husband with handsome Highlander Jamie (who looks like Tom Brady of the Boston Patriots, without the deflated footballs).",1441584000,,1072,4.707446808510638

Prime Video however, is practically worthless. In this example, Prime hooked me on a program before I learned subsequent episodes would cost money in addition to my annual membership fee. I do not feel that is fair. At least with Netflix, you pay for a service, and you get a selection of programming you do not have to pay additional fees for.

I love the story and they did a great job  of taking a very long book and capturing it well in a few hours.  I didn't rate it a 5 star because I felt they went way too far with graphic sex and  graphic violence/wounds, etc.  I would love to see them take out some of that in further episodes.  Many of us would enjoy it much more without the extended sex and violence.

6541900,2,B00M0GMC26,"Initially fascinating account that whisks her from 1940s to 1740s.  Rather than staying accurate to time and place, it gets sidetracked with increasing amounts of violence and nudity.  Sme of which just doesnt need to be seen.  I referred to books and the same thing applies.  The author describes for effect and misses fact along the way.  Babies solely breast fed do not have brown goo for stool.  It is more like yellow mustard and very mild fragrance.  Little details described should be truthful, not just scitillating.  Beautiful costumes and locations.  Be ready on your fast forward button and remember you might have to use it alot if you care to venture in.  Wsh I could have been warned before beginning.",1441324800,4,715,4.8347107438016526

6541958,2,B00M0GMC26,"First let me start by saying I read all the books as fast as they were published and several more than once.  So I was very happy to see that a series was being made. Though also a bit worried as it is tough to put everything that a book holds into a movie/series. I thought I was buying Season 1, turned out to be half of Season 1. I did not pay for the HD version as I was not sure that I would like it or not. The standard version was fuzzy and appeared to be downgraded. It appears that the person who cast the actors did not read the books, or perhaps there just was not anyone who fit the part of Jamie?  I am disappointed that the author agreed on the actor who plays Jamie (And I know from other reviews that I am not alone.). The actors who play Claire and Jamie are good, but the chemistry that is supposed to be between them is missing. Maybe some of the fiery looks that should be exchanged between them were edited out?  Jaime is supposed to be a tall red haired warrior and I apparently cannot get over the fact that the actor who plays him is not. But it seems one is always disappointed in something when a book is made into a movie. Nothing can match our imaginations. Personally I was hoping for a bit more romance than British brutality to be portrayed.",1440806400,,1272,4.100401606425703

It felt like the writers were  obsessed with rape and definitely with filming and watching it,  because it was happening constantly!  I thought ""surely that would be the last time"", and no... five minutes later it would happen again!  It would be so much better if all of that was left out! They can make it obvious that she gets raped without actually showing it!  The movie ""Room"" was so incredibly amazing, and it never actually showed the rape happening, or nudity!  It is just so distracting and inappropriate to show.  It took so much away from this!  It could have been so good.  I started watching it not realizing it had such inappropriate content.  Poldark is about 10,000 times better!!!!!!!!!!!  Be a little more creative!  All the porn took away from it and certainly made it difficult to be emotionally invested in the show, because you are too busy being disgusted by the fact that the actress is basically selling her body and letting men grope her for an actors check!

6542011,5,B00M0GMC26,"With one exception, one episode that goes too far, (yes a subjective opinion) the show is great. I hate to sound sexist, but I don't think this is a show men would like all that much. The show stars 90% men and there are really only 3 decent looking women in the whole show, so not much for the guys here. And it is told from a female perspective. For me, I loved it, but it is somewhat like a romance novel,  not a lot of real action or interest for men. Lots of talking. Lots of romantic sex. The fantasy/time travel part of the story is very slim and hardly matters much except to exasperate the heroine when things seem primative to her in her new home. Otherwise it's quite a bit like Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman or a show of that genre, only set in Scotland where things are much more primative. There is a lot of Scottish history which is interesting. Personally I would take this over Game of Thrones any day, but that's because Game of Thrones is written for men, and this is not.",1440374400,,987,4.222222222222222

But this is a great adaptation of the first half of the first  book. I had reservations about the casting at first upon seeing their pictures (I thought they looked too unbelievably pretty -- both Claire and Jamie) but I should have withheld judgement. The two leads are outstanding actors, and they bring depth to the relationship at the core of the story. The changes made from the book are actually helpful clarifications. For example, Frank's character is not simply dropped after Claire crosses over, but we check back in with him in the present day. This seemed an important thing to change; it is actually an improvement upon what I felt to be a weakness in the book. This is a great story, told well.

6542096,5,B00M0GMC26,"Neither the books nor these episodes are really my area of interest, but my wife is a big fan. So I got them for her for her birthday this summer. She's quite pleased with both the adaptation of the novels to screenplays, and the casting.

For my experience, even though the stories aren't doing that much for me, I do watch them with her. The blu ray presentation is flawless, and the packaging is quite attractive. Her friends who have visited see the box and uniformly say ""Ohhhhh! Outlander!"", so she has a lot of company in her appreciation of the series.

These shows are not for the faint of heart. They're pretty gritty, and in some cases quite bloody. You should be prepared for that in case it makes a difference to your viewing. And if you are considering letting the kids watch with you, also be advised that there is somewhat frequent frank discussion (and implied depiction) of rape and attempted rape. I would definitely peg this one as suitable for mature audiences.

6542142,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is a no-brainer purchase for fans of Diana Gabaldon' s Outlander series of books but an excellent choice for fans of the genres of Romance, Time Travel, historical fiction and drama. For over twenty years, since the first volume (and increasing in volume/pages for each consecutive book), the books have had a life of their own. Usually with the translation of the written word to the big or small screen, something gets lost. Not so with Outlander. Between Ronald Moore's direction, and input from Diana Gabaldon herself (in a cameo in the First Season) as well as all the excellent actors chosen, the story we love is brought to life. Scotland herself shines as the background, and this first season makes quite a few of us wish to be in the Highlands. Fall in love with Outlander, and Claire and Jamie, and the beauty of Scotland.",1439337600,,838,4.707482993197279

I bought this for my wife, figuring ""Volume One"" was some cutesy way of saying that it was ""Season One"" (because the book are voluminously large!). It's not. It's the first eight episodes of Season One, WITH SPACE LEFT IN THE BOX FOR YOU TO FIT ""VOLUME TWO,"" WHEN IT COMES OUT.

The show is great, but the marketing is garbage. I'm not sure if I'm willing to pay another $40 for the last eight episodes.",1439251200,,435,4.304878048780488

6542176,5,B00M0GMC26,"This series depicts what happens to a twentieth- century English woman who slips through time back to 1700 Scotland. Set in the gorgeous landscape of the Scottish highlands, the animosity between the English and Scottish plays out in raw and painful detail, i.e. the whipping of Jamie, and the many attempts of rape on Claire. The stories momentum is sustained through the use of some flashback to Claire's former life in the 1900's and the building romantic tension between the protagonist, Claire Beauchamp and Jamie McTavish. Both actors do the original story justice and then some. In fact, the casting for all of the characters, both sinister and benign, is perfect in that it holds true to the novel. (No doubt due to the influence of the author.) There are three particular things that as reader you will find: one, a desire to read the whole series; two, an eagerness to watch each episode, back to back, and perhaps like me, all over again; and three, a sense that this story sits on the back burner of your mind. I find myself thinking about this story throughout my day. I am looking forward to the second set of episodes from Amazon.",1438992000,2,1145,4.701492537313433

Not for the squeamish, however, as there is a lot of blood, violence and sex. The second half of the 1st season is even worse, though.

The time-traveling heroine is caught up in the politics of 18th Century Scotland as well as finding love with an (of course) extremely handsome Scot. If you don't know anything of the history, this story shows enough to explain why many Scots STILL want independence from the United Kingdom.

The violence is no doubt typical of the era, but an English captain takes such pleasure in whipping said handsome Scot, and the camera lingers so long on his lacerated back, that the scene verges on torture porn. It doesn't bother me, but some viewers may get queasy.

6542261,3,B00M0GMC26,Read the book by Diana Gabaldan and save your money. If this had been a Hallmark Channel production I would've stuck with it. But Starz finds nudity and explicit sex or violence necessary. Be warned. Don't watch this one with children in the room. I won't order Volume 2.,1438214400,,271,4.551020408163265

Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan, the leads, are fabulous and the screen play and cinematography are excellent.

6542266,3,B00M0GMC26,"Intriguing and captivating enough, but a little too Halmark romancey for me. Still, I'll watch the season. The lead, Caitriona Balfe, is especially good, and I find myself pulled into her character and plight to keep me on edge.

6542272,4,B00M0GMC26,"Interesting fantasy/romance created by Ronald Moore, who brought us  Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Battlestar Galactica. A British nurse in 1945 is suddenly transported to Scotland in 1743, in a clan at war with the British occupying army. Cinematography is sumptuous and the actors are exceptional. Great love scenes. For my taste there's too much dialogue lost  in incomprehensible Gaelic. Tobias Menzies, playing the dual role Claire's husband Frank Randall in 1945 and the British captain Black Jack in 1743 (who played Brutus in the Rome series), is outstanding. Great entertainment.",1438214400,,641,5.4

What's frustrating is that I need to wait so long for the second part of season 1 to be released on DVD! Why couldn't all of season 1 be released at the same time?",1438214400,,434,4.117647058823529

Since viewing volume one, I have read the first book in the Outlander Series and the TV show is pretty close to the book, better in some ways.  In my opinion this program is superbly acted, written, and directed.  Caitriona Balfe and Sam Hueghan are excellent in their leading roles as Claire and Jamie.  The supporting cast are fantastic as well.  If you enjoy historical fiction with a bit of romance, you will enjoy this show.",1438128000,,564,4.384615384615385
6542282,5,B00M0GMC26,"If you've read the books, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Jamie and Claire are well represented by Heughen and Balfe.  The only criticism I have is the amount of time spent on Frank's part in the story.  I felt myself wishing they would shorten this part and get back to Jamie and Claire.  That being said, I couldn't bear to give this four stars for that reason.  You will enjoy!",1438128000,,387,4.394366197183099

Considering how much is in the books, I think they do an amazing job of hitting all the most important plot lines as well as plenty of the more minor ones as well. I haven't seen the second season yet, but I plan to purchase it once it's available here. I've heard it was amazing too. Don't expect the series to be exactly like the book, but if you can appreciate the challenge of translating a book into a film and keep an open mind, you'll likely be incredibly pleased and surprised at what a fine adaptation this is.",1437782400,,629,4.25

how Jamie and Claire look and the surrounding locations. The series did not disappoint me...LOVE
the musical score and all things Scottish. Being American, I will watch the whole series again to

the character Claire is subjected to an undo amount of assault which does not appear in the

what has been happening to Jamie 's son Will?  I cant wait to find out?  I hope they get a chance to be together as a familie, since Brianna and Roger plus Jem and Mandy just got back in the last book. I have

The Deleted Scenes are few (1-2 for most episodes), and contain few additions to the scenes included in the episodes after final editing. Many of them are quite literally 5 minutes of the identical scene, with maybe a 1-sentence alteration.

But his production is undeniably wonderful, with superlative effort and results on all levels--story, writing, direction, acting, costuming, makeup, lighting, cinematography and a beautifully expressive lead (I'd never heard of before). playing a highly capable modern woman thrust by magic circumstances 200 year into the past.
It's NOT sci-fi per se. It is historically accurate, sometimes very violent , and sometimes romantic with a bit of nudity. If you're willing to enjoy such an amalgam, I invite you to share the thrills and chills of this show.

Well cast, most of the characters look and seem much like you would expect they should.  You ladies who have dreamed about what Jamie might be like will not be disappointed!  If you haven't read the books, you might have a little more trouble connecting the relationships of all the people at first, but you should still enjoy it.

I am immensely frustrated that the second half of Season 1 is unavailable, as of yet, to stream. But this is a commentary on how thoroughly I enjoyed the first half. I ""rewatched"" episode 1 with my best friend today who was prepared ""not to like it."" He loved it and I was able to catch things that I had not the first time around. A strong recommend for history buffs, romances and magic. My best bud ( Both of us Highlander fans) said the cinematography in this blew Highlander away. I guess ""There Can Be More Than One!!""

Many scenes are almost identical to what i pictured in my head as a reader. Personally, I thought the actor playing Jamie would be taller, but again, that's just what I pictured in my head.

6542510,5,B00M0GMC26,"Reading the book is always better -- but this is a production that stays very close to the feel and the events of the books.  The characters may look somewhat different from the images I have built over twenty years of reading the books, but emotionally they ring true to the original.  The actors, from main parts to bit parts, have worked on making their characterizations truly about those people.  I have also been pleasantly surprised by the production company's decisions about where to make the breaks in the production.  The years in France is a good example: I was stunned to realize that that time would have eight episodes all by itself.  Outstandingly good decision-making!  I could wish that Jamie were as tall as the books say, but Sam Heughan is wonderful in the part.  And the feel of the highlands depicted is fantastic and cold and gorgeous.  As a longtime fan of Outlander, I have been pleased with the quality and vision of the series, and I plan to keep collecting the DVDs, as I have the books on my eReader.",1436745600,,1030,4.590163934426229

6542513,5,B00M0GMC26,"Outlander season 1 does a great job of following the book and laying out the foundation for the series. The actors make it enjoyable to watch. Jamie fits his book description to a tee. Clare's description not so much, but the actress is so good at the portrayal of Clare, one forgets about her physical attributes. Of course, always hard to meet the expectations of the book readers. But, they managed to make it an enjoyable visual experience that met most of my expectations.... an avid reader of the series.",1436745600,,510,4.677777777777778

6542520,5,B00M0GMC26,I am totally hooked on this series. I love the strength of Claire and the intricacy of the story lines.

6542521,5,B00M0GMC26,"I made the mistake (not really) of watching the Season 1 Episode 1 free trial of Outlander and from there I was off to the races. I had been so bummed over the end of the Game of Thrones that I wanted to cancel HBO So I started perusing other Cable Networks. Never having watched Starz before, I decided to watch their free Season 1, Episode 1 of Outlander. Clever of them to do that. All other Episodes you had to buy unless you had STARZ. That was ok. I was going to switch anyway. Having never heard of the books, author, TV Show or actors, but loving historical/period pieces with a little romance thrown in, I was hooked from the start. I thought each and every Episode was like a movie unto itself. Because the entire Season 1 had just ended and was now On Demand, I signed up for STARZ and began watching the Episodes back to back for hours on end. Unbelievably good. Each and every actor, actress, up and down the line was selected  and perfect for the part(s) they played or the work they did in the making of it. I'm just blown away over this TV series and am at a loss to review this without it, too, becoming a novel. I loved the segment  with Ronald D. Moore after each Episode and the Spoiler Alert Warnings. Those segments were truly beneficial for those of us that never read the books. It gave a lot of insight into the manner in which (I want to say the ongoing movie/not television shows) the shows were filmed, Ronald's desire to film in Scotland, use as much ""homegrown"" talent and skilled professionals in making this masterpiece in the scope of all television movies and/or shows I've ever seen. Ronald said it was an extremely difficult thing to produce. When I found out the lengths that he went to to consider every person involved, work closely with the Author and have a different director do a 2 Episode only block of work (the actors and everyone involved would then start anew with the next director), with Ronald's wife (Teri?) doing all the costumes and more, and my brain is getting fried trying to just describe this monumental masterpiece in every way, and I haven't even gotten to the actors. Whew. I ended up buying the digital books for my Kindle and after I'd watched all 16 Episodes in short order, I began reading the books. Well worth the effort despite their length and heft. (Not an issue of digital downloads which makes reading them much faster and easy to transport.) During the reading efforts (I'm currently on Book 5 of 8) I began To watch all the entire Season 1 On Demand again. Rather than buy Season 1 On Demand, I purchased the Season 1 Part 1 (Ep 1-8) DVD thru Amazon, as well as the Season 1 Soundtrack (Amazing Amazing), and Author Diana Gabaldon's Outlandish Companion (Newest/Revised/Very large book) to go with Books 1-4, and began looking at every possible article/interview/talk show/event that had anyone or anything to do with the people, the making of the shows, or the Country of Scotland and the Gaelic Language. If you've gotten this far, congratulations! You're most likely as hooked as I am. The chemistry of the actors on and off the set are worth following and if there aren't grammies, emmies and all sorts of other awards for everything Outlander, well...it would be a shame for them, however it wouldn't diminish a thing with their fans. Would I recommend The Outlander? Yes, I would, in any and all forms it comes in. It's just that good. This won't be proofed so my apologies.",1436659200,6,3455,4.535256410256411
6542522,5,B00M0GMC26,"So far this series is absolutely impeccably done. The casting is spot on and the fact that it's shot on location just makes it that much more amazing to watch. Scotland is an amazing place, especially the Highlands, and this series captures that quality really well. The acting is well done too. In the book, there are intense scenes that make it hard to continue reading or hard to stop reading, and I feel that same emotion when watching this film series. Can't wait for the second half.",1436572800,,489,4.568181818181818

6542582,4,B00M0GMC26,"For fans of Diana Gabledon's Outlander series, Outlander the television series is a bit better than average and improves from episode to episode.  The series is slow to get moving, and ends as it begins to come into it's own, leaving the viewer hanging waiting for the next eight episodes.  The actress playing Claire does a good job of inhabiting the role created in the books, and the actor who plays Jamie gives it his best shot, but he looks so unlike his fictional description that it is hard to accept him in the role.  The series does a relatively good job of sticking to the story set forth in the book, with only minor differences here and there.  My favorite character is Ned Gowan, who fits his part to a T.  If you've not read the books, the story may be hard to follow, and if I had to choose between spending money on the books or money on the t.v. series, I'd go with the books.",1436400000,,893,4.291666666666667

The heroine has very legitimate ""ahhh what's happening?!"" reactions instead of ""and then I looked deeply into his eyes and felt my heart throb"" reactions.

I did not intend to purchase the whole volume, but once I ran out of media credits I just had to know what happens next. The cinematography is stunning, and the storyline is suspenseful and emotional. The casting is also well done. I was a little hesitant about the actor portraying Jamie, but the chemistry between he and the actress who portrays Claire made him perfect.

While there are some slight deviations from the book, this adaptation is thoughtful and well produced. Changes are made for the integrity of the cinematic experience, while remaining true to the spirit and details of the books as much as possible. The historical details are also well researched. Everything about the show honors the original books while standing on its own two legs.

I've read the whole series two or three times plus am listening to it now as an audio book. Seeing it brought to life on screen is truly a delight, although sad we can't enjoy it as a family story which I had hoped for. wish we could enjoy it together but sadly, it's TOO close to the book for that part... Rather nearly porn at times, so it must be watched in privacy and adults only.  Was even uncomfortable having a college age daughter watching with me and changed to something else to watch together.

6542635,5,B00M0GMC26,"I read the books long before the show came along (like many...many others) and I have to say feel that the show does the books justice. Having watched the entire first season (as it aired and vol. 1 for fun) and now re-reading the books...I have to say they hold pretty true to the overall thread if the book. Of course certain things were left out or altered but that is the nature of any adaptation. I feel that what the show does best is capture the essence of Scotland during that time...which the books did as well. The locations are gorgeous and you would never know that some scenes were filmed on a soundstage. The costumes...omg...the costumes. Drool. Can I please have one of Claire's cowl neck scarfs?? Again...impeccable attention to detail.

The acting. Lord of have mercy. The Scots are phenomenal. The accents, the kilts...the Gaelic wonderful. But for me the show stopper is Tobias Menzies as Frank/Black Jack. His ability to completely change between the 2 characters is amazing. You forget everything about Frank when he is Black Jack. He truly embodies evil when he is the Cpt.

I will admit it, this is the first show in a long time that I will admit I am a ""fan girl"" of. I love it. I love seeing one of my favorite books come to life with such meticulous detail, wonderful acting and jaw-dropping scenery. Well done! Well done!",1435968000,,1349,4.593360995850622

I read the book and the movie is SO different that I found the movie disappointing.  I cant help but wonder how the author feels about this movie.  They changed the story and so many sweet parts of the authors writing were removed. Still not sure if im going to bother with the next season.  If you haven't read the book, i think you will be most entertained and I could recommend the movie.

6542667,5,B00M0GMC26,"What can I said that has not already been said about the Outlander series. I discovered Diane Gabaldons works in 2009 and left my life as I knew it untill I finished the series.  At that time the series was not near its completion and  the waiting on the next book was excruciating.

Reread the series the second time after book 8 come out and found it as entertaining as the first time.  The history of Scotland comes to life under the pen of  Diane Gabaldon.  I have moved a trip to Scotland to the top of my Bucket list.

After purchasing season one and being able to watch it straight through I thought I needed to read that again.  It is amazing how much you do not remember on a reread.  Now I understand book 9 is coming..I can only hope it arrives soon enough not to compel a 4th reading,

I am definitely NOT a person who is easily caught up in a books characters but have become enthralled with Jamie and Claire.  After accidenly finding The Outlamders season 2 on Amazon prime video which is an interview with the three main characters the producer and Diane Gabaldon purchasing Season 2 as it come available is a must have for me.  Jamie is not as rugged as I had imagined but Frank Randall and Claire are cast spot on.",1435708800,2,1231,4.2813852813852815

6542673,5,B00M0GMC26,Better than I imagined!,1435622400,,23,5.0
6542674,5,B00M0GMC26,"This was an impulse watch when I had a free weekend of Starz. I had seen a few little snippets of it in Entertainment Weekly and I had heard of the longstanding book series. I started the first episode ""Sassenach"" thinking this was a simple dramatic story with bits of history thrown in here and there. The heroine seemed pretty, smart, and feisty, and the leading man an atypical beefy stud. When the episode ended I was intrigued and so I naturally followed to the next. As I continued to watch I noticed many things....this is not any ordinary show.
  I watch A LOT of television programming and will give ample opportunity to grow my interest. I also have not read the source material and was coming to the show with a complete blank slate. Yes, there is history, drama, action, and romance...but there was a roundedness to these characters and a complexity to the show that is not often seen on television. Adapting a book is not easy and if done well can enhance the story in a way not possible with the book. This is where Outlander truly shines.
  The characters maintain a charm and ease that is rarely found in a ""genre show"". They also have a depth and humanity that I feel gets brushed off. This is not typical for a ""period"" drama. Most of the time we can only count on action and thrills to keep our attention but some of the most compelling scenes are when the characters are just sitting and talking with each other. For example, in ""Garrison Commander"" the already introduced character of Jonathan ""Black Jack"" Randall is flushed out and in an episode that primarily takes place in 1 room for nearly 45 of the 60 minutes. During a conversation between he and Claire, moments of flashback allow us to explore his perspective and character and the result is polarizing and stunning. Just these two actors having a conversation is mesmerizing. Both of them are outstanding and at this point, the view realizes they aren't watching just any ordinary show.
  The actors on this show are phenomenal. The writing and directing really enhance these performances and give them SO much to work with it is incredible that anyone would pass them off as anything other than top of their game, truthful, and outstanding artists. This goes most especially to those playing Claire, Jamie, and Black Jack. The nuance and honesty is unparalleled. Do not underestimate what is to come.....
  I must also expound upon the innovation within this show. Meaning, they find new ways of exploring storytelling and delivering top-notch episodes. One example is ""The Wedding"". It happens to be both written and directed by women (Anne Kenney and Anna Foerster) who through the use of flashback, take us to the first moment post-wedding and bring us through the 'wedding night' using flashback to tell the story leading up to the moment they are there. This also allows us to explore their unfolding relationship and in the present moment about 90% of the show is told in one room during the honeymoon. Not only is an intimacy and honesty explored and shown to us, we witness an ethereal memory-play that is both raw and sexy. No holds are barred. We see two people really getting to know, explore, and enjoy each other. Tasteful, but graphic nudity displays sex in a way we've never seen on television. We see the characters through each other's eyes and feel the love blossoming.
  This show is not a disappointment. The special features take you into the creative process and make you long for MORE insight into this amazing show. ""Garrison Commander"" is a game-changer and each subsequent episode brings something new and amazing to the table. Buy it, watch it, and then watch it again and again. This is a show unlike any other.

But, aside from that, this is one of the best shows I have ever had the pleasure to watch, and the actors have done such a wonderful job making Susan Gabaldon's characters come alive.

6542682,5,B00M0GMC26,"These books have been handed around the ladies in my family for years, now, and I am delighted that they have been adapted into a television series that while condensing or simplifying some of the storyline, none the less stays true to the books. The acting is amazing, the sets while often brutal are true to story and portrayed as realistically as possible, and the small things that link the two times together (1940s music as soundtrack to a 1740s scene) serves as a simple but recognizable link between events and characters.

Books don't always adapt well to TV but they did an amazing job. I had all the episodes on my DVR and watched them over and over. I will now be watching my DVD over and over. The only thing I'm disappointed with is that the bluray version has a lot more special features than the regular DVD.,1434844800,,414,3.8255813953488373

6542858,5,B00M0GMC26,"I wasn't at all sure I'd like this screen adaptation of a book series I've loved so much. I don't usually enjoy movies made from books, but it's true that longer TV series have much more chance of staying true to the text than a two-hour feature film. My only (small) criticism is that Jamie is a bit shorter and his voice a bit higher pitched than Ms. Gabaldon's descriptions would indicate, but that isn't really significant. The filming is visually stunning, done on site in Scottland., and the attention to detail is striking. Ron Moor said in an interview that his goal had been to make the series for the book fans. Watching that interview convinced me to give this TV series a chance, and I'm very glad I did. I haven't yet finished watching all the episodes, but will update when I do.",1434326400,,793,4.475862068965517

6543002,3,B00M0GMC26,"I've only watched the first four episodes so far. While I really like the actor who plays Jamie and the costumes/scenery are beautiful, I can't get over how obnoxious Claire is in this version. She seems to have a snarl on her face all the time and seems to pick a fight with everyone. I keep getting the distinct impression of her as a spoiled brat flouncing around, sighing and rolling her eyes when she doesn't get her way. In the book she seems much more level-headed and patient. Not doormat patient but sensible and willing to adapt to bad situations. I don't know, I'll give the next four episodes a try before I decide to keep watching or not.",1433721600,,651,4.433333333333334

The actors who portray Jamie and Claire are spot-on.  I can't imaging anyone else playing them better-not just their romantic encounters but the full depth of their complex personalities.  Romance alone wouldn't have kept this book series alive for over 20 years.  But just as good are the other actors: Dougal, Geilis, etc.  The direction and writing is incredible.

6543077,5,B00M0GMC26,"I loved it!! They were so good that I watched all 8 episodes in one evening. I have also started reading the book series.  I was nicely surprised how close the tv episodes stayed to the book with only minor changes here and there.  There are some very difficult parts of the story that were hard to read in book one and will be extremely difficult to view on the tv episodes, but I am 100% invested in the love story and adventures of Jamie and Claire Fraser!!!  Diana Galbaldon did what great writers do, bring characters and events to life within us, along with all the emotions. I've cried, literally four times now, laughed, gotten so intense that I didn't think I could bare any more and I just finished book two!! Onward I go into the series, but it does make me wonder beyond book three where the story can go without loosing the love story of Jamie and Claire. Oh the anticipation of it.",1433289600,,895,4.347305389221557

6543087,3,B00M0GMC26,"I've read most of the Outlander series of books - the first few are my favorites, and I was completely engrossed in these stories. The tv series is not the same, naturally, yet it stands up as a different view of the same tale. I can't say I am less interested, but the distance between me and the characters portrayed is greater. It is such a well-done and beautifully photographed piece of work that I want to see more - but truly balk at the price  for the ""second half"" of this season. Why not offer it at the same price as the first half? It is so obviously a greedy play on the part of Amazon that I just won't go along with it.

I had heard through some friends that is a great series, I watched it, and like every episode, it has flash backs of past of genealogy in the 17th Scottish Century, and it brings you back to the present in the year of 1940's.  It has love,  romance, some nudity, drama, suspence but overall great series, it comes in a two CD.  So far i have only seen one CD it has four episodes.  I still have to see the second CD to find out what happens to Clair since she has traveled to 17th Century.

6543236,5,B00M0GMC26,"While I'm not a time travel fan ordinarily, I do like historical flicks, and I've loved watching Outlander.  Time time travel, while presenting an important backdrop for the protagonist's dilemma, doesn't fly into one's face and blur the overall consciousness.  In other words, the time travel is almost believable, presented as it is with local Scottish  village mysticism.  I can't want for Volume Two!  (Also, isn't Jamie too good to be true?  They shouldn't make men like that!)

They have remained true to the story, although the series does move at a slow pace it will captivate you as the characters develop and the story unfolds. If you are unfamiliar with the story, it is about a woman from the late 1940's who travels back in time to find herself 200 years in the past. My favorite in the series as much as I like the story is the man portraying the character of Jamie. Oh, this guy is such eye candy that I feel guilty (not) of the sheer pleasure of his sight.

Need to take a snack or bathroom break? Never needed to even pause the action, because nothing new happens, ever. Time to go to bed? Sure, why not? No binge-watching, or hanging by a thread at end of an episode. Spoiled as I am by the dynamic cast of Game of Thrones, and the nail-biting action; the actors in this saga, both male and female protagonists, are milk-toast boring (not a whit of sexual tension or chemistry between them) and in the case of the bold darling of the novel, the male lead is just uninspiring.... Yawn, So disappointed. What a great story.... time travel through the standing stones, what could go wrong? If they had followed the pacing of the novel it might have worked....

6543292,1,B00M0GMC26,"oh what a mess. Positive things first: the landscapes and settings are really great. Now for the bad stuff: This is not Claire! She is too tall, too thin, has too dark and obviously no naturally curly hair, she doesn't have the hazelgoldbrown eyes mentioned a thousand times in the books and actually I think she is totally unlikable in the role. This is not Jamie! The guy looks like a too tall hobbit from the shire, a way too modern, too pretty face, that's just not him. And the worst. There is absolutely no chemistry between these two actors - at all!
Plus they changed quite important things from the books, often in unnecessary places.
My personal choice for the leads? My Claire would look  like Julia Ormond in legends of the fall, lightbrown,  (real!) curly hair and an elegant but not extremely modern, likable face and attitude. My Jamie would be someone like Michael Fassbender, he'd have the perfect beautiful but rough enough look I'd expect from Jamie.

The history and the amazing love story between Claire and Jamie Fraser is unique and grabs your interest and holds you with every gripping page. Now that the first season has been renewed for next year on T.V., I can't wait to see how true to the books Ronald Moore and his team keep going. So far, they have done a superb job and I have watched every episode at least twice. Both Catriona and Sam are better than I could have thought them to be in their
roles as Claire and Jamie and as their relationship deepens against history, I can only hope that next year's episodes are as good or better than this year and the series gets picked up for another year and we see the introduction of characters like Brianna, Roger & Lord John Grey.",1432166400,,862,4.327160493827161

6543348,4,B00M0GMC26,"Like many fans of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander novels, I had some doubts about the TV version.  The books have been around for well over twenty years and so many actors' names have been floated around for the film it's easy to lose count.  I don't have cable, so I had to bide my time and wait for the show to come out on video.  The best part of that, of course, is the ability to binge-watch ... and oh, wow, did I.

Executive producer Ronald Moore takes a page from ""Game of Thrones"" in that his cast is not made up of household names or faces.  My personal concern was with Irish actress Caitriona Balfe, who plays Claire.  Claire is routinely described in the books as buxom with curly out-of-control light brown hair and sherry-colored eyes.  She is certainly not a tall willowy brunette.  After a few minutes, though, I didn't care because Ms. Balfe IS Claire.  The male roles are exquisitely cast.  Sam Heughan is the absolute perfect Jamie, and Graham McTavish nails it as Dougal.  However, in shows like these there's always someone who will be made into a huge star, and ""Outlander's"" breakout actor is Tobias Menzies, in the dual role of Frank Randall and Jonathan ""Black Jack"" Randall.  If he doesn't get an Emmy out of this I'll be shocked.

As far as being true to the book, ""Outlander"" does take a couple of liberties, most notably with Claire ALMOST going back to 1945, but overall the liberties are not jarring.  Yes, there's sex and naked bodies and blood, but nothing is gratuitous.  You don't have to read the books--my husband, who's not a reader, got sucked into the show as easily as I did.  Moore has a ton of material with which to work, and things are just getting started.",1431820800,,1698,4.518032786885246

So I search up the show and purchased the first episode on a whim. And then the casting and style of shooting was so perfectly what was in my imagination it was almost creepy! The next click bought me the whole season and I binge watched over the next several days, continuing to listen to the audiobook between episodes. No, it doesn't exactly follow the book. They move a few events back and forth in the story to help make the scenes make sense. But nothing is added or detracted from the story so far. Great show! Great acting! Breathtaking scenery!!

6543373,5,B00M0GMC26,Outstanding! Looking forward to Volume 2! The books were great and the video only enhances them.

At first I was a little disturbed by the choice of actress for Claire and actor for Jamie, but they've grown on me. I think if you have finished the first book, you'll enjoy watching this. It gives you faces to put with the names in the books.",1431734400,,401,4.2894736842105265

6543400,5,B00M0GMC26,"I'm having trouble rating this.  Do I rate the whole set?  The extras?  The series itself??  Within minutes of receiving this, I popped it in the blu-ray player and started watching the extras, having seen the episodes 2+ times each.  I started at the top, and I remember after the first three extras I watched thinking, ""Ooooh, the deleted scenes are next,"" because I had seen them on the list of extras.  Then, when I look at the menu for extras, the deleted scenes are no longer listed.  They were there one minute, gone the next.  I put in the second disc, and no deleted scenes there either.  I take the discs to my roommate's PS4....no deleted scenes on either disc.  They were there.  I swear.  I saw them!  So I return these to Amazon, and get a new set.  Guess what?  No deleted scenes on this one either....on both the blu-ray player and the PS4.  I had to hunt them down on the internet.  So in that respect, I was very disappointed.
That being said, this is now my favorite TV show ever!!!  I am a fan of the books and have been for many years.  This is one of the best adaptations of a book that I have seen in a long time (and watching movie/TV adaptations of books that I have read is sort of a thing of mine.)  The actors are fabulous - all of them!  The writing is solid, and the changes are acceptable.  This show is a thing of beauty in every way.  Can't. Stop. Watching.",1431561600,,1390,4.221374045801527

6543442,5,B00M0GMC26,"Fantastic original series by Starz available at Amazon based on the popular book Outlander. Every department in production from the actors to the soundtrack to the costumes and cameramen/women bring this book, and the Scottish highlands of 1743, to life. Visually, it is breathtaking and makes me want to visit Scottland. The depiction of the time is so fascinating, even seeing people's roles, the clan structure, what it takes to get dressed...I'm going to call it entertaining and educational. :) Although I think the book may be a bit geared towards women, the show is enjoyed by everyone in my family. There is some great humor in it, and some potentially tough scenes from the book are handled extremely well.",1431302400,2,715,4.966666666666667

This programme has not yet been shown in New Zealand and as I have read all the books and loved them I wondered whether the essence of the characters could be reflected by the chosen actors.

It makes for a fun ride for a long time avid fan of the books to look forward to watching the Series and not always know what is going to happen.  The cleverness of the writing with keeping true to the books and yet throwing in just a little bit of added spice to keep it interesting is working!  I look forward to each episode in order to see just what they will do next to make it work on Television.  I love Diana's writing and the TV writers are doing her justice.

The DVDs plays fine but I don't like the auto play feature on them. The auto play feature won't allow me to access the menu screen unless I fast forward to the end of the auto-episode that's playing.
 I noticed DVDs are getting odd on how and when they will play. Some don't like the new DVD player's. Some will play on a home based dvd player but won't play on laptop DVD player's.  Is the movie industry selling defective DVDs on purpose? Is the movie industry targeting their DVDs to a specific DVD player while preventing them from playing others?",1431216000,,660,4.357723577235772

6543467,5,B00M0GMC26,"Though I can go to Starz and watch this whole series On Demand, I know that ability will only be available for a couple of years, if that.  So - it's necessary to have this whole season in your collection of hard copies.

This series is spectacular.  It doesn't follow the books all that closely, but, filming everything would likely take 20 years.  The producer has chosen wisely, and the scenes he uses, while omitting lots of important action and information, and changing or adding other things, have the effect of portraying the Outlander world as we know it.

At first I was irritated at how events took place, with the typical howls of ""It didn't happen that way at all!""  As  the series proceeds, though, I get it.  The filmed editions are true to the spirit of the books, show us how it is, and don't actually leave out anything that matters.  The producer has changed a lot of stuff, but, in the end, it all adds up to a portrayal of the world of Outlander, just the way Gabaldon wrote it.

In my mind, I have had images of all the characters as they are in the books.  In some cases, especially with Claire, who, in the series, looks nothing like the Claire of the books, it was a bit jarring, at first.  However, whenever I think of Claire now, all I see is Catriona.  And Jamie is EXACTLY how I imagine him in the books.  That was inspirational casting.  As with most things, the filmed images end up taking over your imagined ones.  In this situation, it's fine.  Everything works.

Another bonus is that the producer is a Scot, and knows and loves Scotland.  The landscape and settings he has chosen completely illustrate the books.  I am overwhelmed at the beauty and majesty of the land.  This is a major part of the whole series, and another reason why it should be watched by anyone who loves these books.

I love the series.  I love all the books.  IF you like the show, then you should buy and read the actual books.  They are so much better than the series, which should tell you something.",1431129600,3,2012,4.4021739130434785

6543526,3,B00M0GMC26,"For those of you who love the books, be advised that this is not really an adaptation; it's a re-imagining and reinterpretation of the story from the book. If you want to see Jamie and Claire come to life and see their story, you won't. They have turned most of it upside-down and added so much filler that they left no time to tell the actual story.

Some examples:
- Jamie and Claire are not friends and don't really talk. There's some Edward and Bella staring with flutes and then they have sex and then we're supposed to buy that they're so in love and the best couple ever. There are none of the great conversations that had you up all night reading. None of the real relationship outside great sex.

- Frank is some kind of romantic hero and he and Claire share the world's greatest love. He is given so much time (and Jamie so little) that you're going to wonder if you are watching the same story. You aren't.

- Jamie's character starts well, but the writers go way off in episode 5 and they never come back. He is unrecognizable as Jamie - not the actor's fault. When the writers stay on track, Sam Heughan is excellent ... but don't let that get your hopes up. Most of Jamie's dialog is missing and then - when added - it's in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong meaning. He's mostly a background character and not a main one. It's kind of heartbreaking. They pretty must just use him to make dopey, moon-eyes at Claire.

- Most shocking of all is episode 8, where the beautiful honeymoon from the book is replaced by 40 minutes of Frank Randall in the most ridiculous subplot ever. Tobias Menzies is an excellent actor, but there was no need for this. And, it completely killed the story. Do NOT watch this episode. Also, when Claire runs for the stones, you will .... WANT her to go home. You read that right. Like I said, a re-interpretation, not an adaptation.

- They make no attempt to make it believable that Claire could love Jamie or want to stay with him long-term. Anything that would make her stay has been removed and is not added back in the second half.

Despite all this critique, I'm giving this three stars because the acting is good, the writers are good, and the scenery is beautiful and that's worth noting. They just had (and have) no interest in telling the actual story. I don't know what the goal of their changes is, but I hope they know because I bet this show is really hard to make.

If you adjust your expectations, you may enjoy it. However, if you keep waiting for the story to begin and assume that it's coming (like I did), you're going to be disappointed over and over again. I enjoy the second half now that I know not to expect the story or the characters I love. If you're alright with that, then buy it and watch ... just not episode 8; skip that entirely. Trust me here.",1430870400,10,2834,4.335849056603774

6543575,5,B00M0GMC26,"Best series on Starz and premium channels in general due to wonderful adaptive script writing and exceptional acting.  Historically interesting and reasonably accurate, the Outlander cast brings a sincerity and humanity to their roles that is sorely missing from cult projects such as GOT.  I watch GOT with my husband and the constant aggression, darkness, and  dismissive assault on women and rape like sex is not interesting.  Outlander, by its non-classification status, is a treat and a relief from the testosterone driven series such as GOT and Black Sails; especially in the interactions of  Claire and Jamie.  Finally! something besides blunt swordsmanship and constant darkness...Outlander is much more interesting and varied and gives us emotions a woman can relate with.  ""Chemistry"" is inaccurate between Claire and Jamie...The acting is committed and fearless, demonstrating hesitation, attraction, self-consciousness, sympathy, fear, anger, frustration and that yearning reach for understanding.  The sex scenes are graphic, yet convey the elements of genuine emotional discovery between two people. It is about  time for the heartfelt  sensitive and joyful responses Claire and Jamie exhibit.  It is refreshing to eavesdrop on the positive growing human elements of passion shared between two people and the ongoing struggle towards trust.  Besides sexual hunger, Claire and Jamie bring the counterpoint, bursting naturally and uninhibited into an instant  fierce confrontation and following remorse.  Caitriona Balfe's Claire  is intelligent, conflicted and sensitive and bossy. Wherever did they find her?  She is a gift.  Sam Heughan gives us a wry, humorous Scots warrior and reminds us what falling in love, vows, and honor are all about.  And a note on Sam Heughan.  Dubbed as ""man candy"" and he certainly is , he is a wonderful actor with an astonishing range and subtle nuance.  Graham McTavish as Dougal is perfect as a hardline Scots patriot, the practitioner of the old ways and old warriors who are losing their power..  His performance provides  terrific contrast to Jamie's romantic chivalry and ability to rationally address issues.  As to Tobias Menzies...he gives me nightmares.  The scenery and sets are so fantastic that as an American Scot I find myself genetically homesick.  And bravo  to the cast, crew, producers, writers, directors...all soaked in Scottish rain I assume...you have given the thinking viewer a gift of great beauty and a hopeful story.  Hats off to the risks you are taking and the adventures you invite us to share!",1430697600,3,2572,5.396984924623116

6543623,4,B00M0GMC26,"I ordered Outlander after a good friend in Edinburgh, Scotland gave it high marks. I've enjoyed watching the first eight episodes and found much of Outlander's recreation of 18th century Scotland compelling with the time shifts and twists used effectively to enhance dramatic effect.  I especially like the strong female lead and Outlander's comparisons of the transitional U.K. after WWII and transitional Britain in the 18th century. There are, however, other aspects that I find difficult and a bit clumsy. Those are: the facile way in which a 20th century English woman understands 18th century Scottish Highland dialect (and here I mean their English not their Gaelic) and the way in which Gaelic culture is presented with all the 'nudge nudge wink wink' esthetic of a locker room. True there is the bard at Doune Castle (aka Castle Leoch), but on the whole, Gaelic culture is heavily stereotyped, Outlander not doing enough to give authentic expression to what was/is a highly sophisticated society. I'm sure this will shift positively as the heroine develops a finer sense of the culture through future exploits, but the spoken Gaelic thus far is short, guttural and lacking the exquisite sense of humor and poetry that makes even coarse expressions in Gaelic sound like a lullaby or a benediction. Nevertheless, recommended.",1430524800,,1332,5.166666666666667

6543639,5,B00M0GMC26,"I gave it a ""love it""/5 stars because 1. I never knew that this would be made into a movie, a series, ANYTHING. So I was VERY excited to say the least, to hear that STARZ was going to tackle it!! Though also fearful that they might ruin my beloved series of books & worse: these AMAZING characters!!! Oh Jamie, is he not the perfect man? And Claire pretty much the perfect woman as well. Not as in without flaw, they have their flaws & foibles or else they would not be realistic or oh so loveable & relatable *ok amazon, i am spelling the word correctly, so I have no idea why u have it underlined!*, but perfect they are, nonetheless. 2. The show IS very well written, produced, acted & pretty much anything else I can think of. 3. I DO LOVE IT!
But there are things that bother me, details. Jamie is supposed to be 6'4""-6'5"" ish & HUGE, but then I guess how many red-headed (though can be dyed & I think Sam's hair IS dyed) enormous, yet gorgeous Scotchmen are out there? (Plus he should get those prominent moles, off his face, side of body, etc., sliced off! it's no big deal to do). That are actors, no less. Claire's hair REALLY bothered (& still bothers me to some extent), the actresses' hair is NOT what Claire's is supposed to be (I've accepted her non-amber/whiskey colored eyes, again how many actresses...blah blah, though she COULD wear contacts! they are mentioned frequently in the books, after all), & her hair could be SO easily attained (yes I do hair, amongst other things AND i worked in the industry (on films, etc.) as well, so I'm not just talking out of my you know what. Don't think I can curse on here? So yes, her hair could be SO easily attained, again a VERY prominent feature in the books! Her unusual hair color, though it is brown. (Which is why Jamie calls her ""mo duinne"" for ""my brown one"", though apparently that is not correct Gaelic, I don't care. It is *in the book* or supposed to be: brown shot w/gold, cinnamon, blonde, light brown, dark brown, silver (mostly later), a SLEW of colors, which I don't have memorized in my mind & also the fact that it's untameable, *again, correct word & spelling amazon* so wildly curly & she can never keep it in place, which they touched on for a second during one of the early episodes, then never again. i can never get over her hair being SO dark & so all one color, so inky. Just a big hank of all one color, (an obvious dye job, or perhaps even wig), they can so easily put in some muted highlights if nothing else. The mere fact that human's hair is generally not ALL one shade, like it was dipped in shoe polish or something.  Everyone's hair (naturally) has more than one shade to it. Jamie's hair in fact, is meant to be the same, or very similar, yet in a red vein, shot through w/roan, cinnamon (again), gold, titian, etc. but I'm not going to nitpick about that. These are VERY BIG SHOES TO FILL!! And no one (generally) will be 100% satisfied w/casting. Oh, & Dougal looks NOTHING like his description in the book, ummm, that guy OH! Murtaugh looks & acts virtually nothing like he is in the book. And he is such a charming (which u find out over a long period of time) & unique & interesting character in the books. Now he's just some generic Scotsman.  Yes, I prefer the best actors for the job, over exact replicas looks wise. So, I could go on & on about details that are wrong, story points & even full out scenarios that they completely changed, removed or whatever, but I'll spare you & myself. ;)
OH!! Some of the changed plots are bothersome. The thieves hole deal, the witchcraft trail, why did they change her rescue so much? Now THAT I found almost stupidly ridiculous! Jamie just walks into the courtroom & announces she's his wife & she's given back to him? Gimme a break. I guess they were pressed for time or something?
OH!!!! And as a Makeup Artist, I HAVE to comment on the utter ridiculousness of the makeup done on Jamie's back! It is HORRIFIC!! It is sooooo bad! So unrealistic! I'm sure it's a prosthetic, as they don't want to sit there for hours & paint up his back every time it needs to be filmed, but that's exactly what it looks like! A big, floppy piece of plastic or rubber that a child slashed through & they painted up to be made to look like something. Even my son (who doesn't watch the show, nor has he read the book, but is VERY intelligent & discerning & his taste is impeccable!) came into the room while I was watching the 2nd or so episode & he glimpsed it & started laughing so hard. He said ""omg, are they kidding? is that supposed to be his back that was whipped? what a joke!"" & I agree.
They need to FIX that back. I know: continuity, but it can gradually get better & more realistic over time. I guess most of the viewers are buying it? But it is laughable. Sadly.
I'm loving Jenny, the actress who plays her is really great! Though her accent doesn't seem right? Most of their accents don't seem right. Not scottish enough, or whatever the case may be. Claire's british accent is great.
Again, though, I DO really enjoy the show!! As I said before. I'm just picking on the things that bother/have bothered me, as any true fan of any book/series would do. You fall in love so deeply w/the characters (I have anyway), that they become real to you, like members of your family. So you jealously guard them in your mind.
I think they should hire ME for an on set consultant. Seriously! I have read all of the books numerous times, especially ""Outlander"", I've probably read that 10 times or more since it was published? I have FORCED countless numbers of my friends to read it, they in turn have fallen in love as well. We all agree that Jamie is the perfect man! Again, his imperfections are perfect as well. If only Jamie or many Jamies existed! And I don't even like redheaded men romantically usually, *even though I'm a redhead, but not a natural one*,  there's a first time for everything right? Haha
Okay, I have to run, I think I've stated most of what was on my mind re: Outlander. I DO hope it continues long enough to cover at least HALF of the books! It would be great if they went to the end, but I'm not holding my breath on that, you never know though. :)
And I hope I haven't bored or irritated anyone who's been patient enough to read my review. Thanks. Slinte Mhath!! ;)",1430438400,,6323,4.334177215189873

6543646,5,B00M0GMC26,"I read the novel in 1991, and I really liked it then.  I saw that is had been made into a series, and I wasn't sure how the series would live up to the written word.  I was especially uncertain about how some of the more graphic scenes would be portrayed.  AS I don't have STARZ, I waited until the first half of season 1 came on DVD.
I watched all 8 episodes in a row with my 82-year-old mother who also liked the novel.  (Disclosure:  I am 47).  We both loved the series.  I was true to the book and has a great pace.  I did have to close my eyes a few times during some of the more graphic scenes, but I probably would have done the same for the book if I could have and still followed the story.  The graphic scenes were true to the book and how I think I had envisioned them.  The history lessons embedded in the text came alive in the series, too.  This was especially interesting due to the recent vote around Scottish independence.  The dress, the lifestyle, the Scots Gaelic were all amazing.
I highly recommend the series to anyone.  I say anyone because my husband and college-aged son soon joined us and watched over half of the series themselves.  Thumbs up from them as well.",1430438400,,1189,4.20353982300885
6543647,5,B00M0GMC26,Great Series!  Our first movies/shows on our new Firestick.  Series is great and works perfectly on the Firestick.  Highly recommend both.,1430438400,,138,5.476190476190476
6543648,4,B00M0GMC26,"Yeah, so after reading book 4, but before the dvd was released, I made the near tragic mistake of watching a cast interview on Youtube. Like others before me, I was far less than wowed by the Clair and Jamie actors. So much so that I wasn't planning to watch the series at all. That basically homely and haggard looking woman as Clair? That scrawny dude as heartthrob and warrior? Then I found a price so low that I couldn't refuse, and I'm mostly over it now.
Caitriona Balfe won me over quite fast. The nude stuff didn't factor into my change of heart, although it didn't hurt me much, either. At all.
I'm still about 50% out on the guy, but its easy to shift my eyes to the scenery when he plays the scene a little 'light'.

Cinematography is excellent, and  Bear Mc Creary's music is spellbinding. You need to check  out his remarkable website.",1430438400,,848,4.388535031847134

I decided to check the ratings on Amazon and they were through the roof! I bought it knowing little about it. The first episode started a little slow, but once I met Jamie, I was hooked!! There is a little more (ok, a lot more) sex and nudity than I'm comfortable with, but even so, I can't stop watching! I checked out the books at the library to see what happened next because I couldn't wait for part 2 of season one to come out on dvd! From what I've read so far, the show closely follows the books. I watched all the episodes in 2 days. I ate, slept and drank Outlander. I recommended it to a friend who is going to Scotland and she loved it too!",1430352000,,775,4.006451612903226
6543658,1,B00M0GMC26,"If you are a devoted fan of the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon, this film is not for you.  No beautiful Sassenach maidens or handsome, dashing Highlanders here.  Apparently the screenwriter tossed out the book, which is replete with vivid descriptions of the attractive, appealing and good looking people Claire observed; because the film is populated with  disgustingly grotesque characters - more gargoyle than human.  The setting is virtually without lighting, making it impossible to identify one actor from another.  The background volume is so loud, most of the dialogue is lost without using subtitles.
I have only watched half the episodes on disc 1 and will not watch any of the rest.  Both the book and audio book are wonderful - too bad the film is such a waste of time, talent and money.",1430352000,5,803,4.911111111111111

I assumed it would include a regular version. It only included the Blur Ray and digital. I call that being cheap and not clear in the product description.

The story line seems to follow the book faithfully and you can't ask for better than that.  The actor who plays Jamie is exactly like I pictured him and he is HOT.  Clair doesn't quite match what I had in my mind, but the actress is skilled and her appearance is very acceptable.  The costumes are really wonderful and it's great to actually see what I had pictured and hear the correct pronunciations of the Gaelic words.  I just got it recently and have already watched it twice.  I'm so in love with these characters I cannot tell if someone who has not read the books can appreciate the show.  If you read the books then you should know there is a lot of sex, so I don't understand why some people act so surprised.  I have already pre-ordered Part 2.",1430265600,2,918,4.321637426900585

Then bummer, I don't have Starz.  So, I figured I'd just buy each season.  Very disappointed in how ""they"" decided to split the season into two parts and price them so that you are paying @$55 for the year - which is a lot more than seasons of most other shows go for.

The series follows the books fairly closely.  While the actors aren't exactly who I pictured in my head while reading the books (and they usually aren't) they do a very good job.  The scenery is beautiful!  I binge-watched the first 8 episodes in one day and can't wait to see the rest.

It's rated TV-MA and it definitely earns the rating, so if you are easily offended by gruesome war wounds, naked bodies, or mildly explicit sex scenes - both consensual and non, then this may not be for you.",1430265600,2,914,4.23121387283237

It has EVERYTHING  from magic/miracles/sweet romance, bitter jealousy, and true love to vicious,bloody beatings and gore&death to excitement, major drama, history, beautiful scenery and sex and so much MORE all rolled into one!  Who could ask for more? Plus Jamie Fraser...wow he is gorgeous without knowing he is, which makes him even more attractive! I LOVE how strong Clare is and I love the chemistry between them. I think the casting was outstanding.  Outlander really does have everything and I feel sorry for those who haven't seen it or refuse to try because they don't think it's ""their thing"".... I didn't really think it would be mine either but I gave it a shot.  Now I have to read the books because I can't stand to wait for the next episode or season to find out what is going to happen!! I just hope it doesn't end suddenly (like the show Merlin did). I hope Outlander continues on because once people invest in these characters we really look forward to seeing what continues on screen!

I was amazed at how different Clare's husband Frank and Black jack are so obviously the same actor but two different characters. Jamie's back makes me flinch. The one problem I have with this series (and it comes in larger doses in the later episodes) is the violence toward women and the rape scenes. They seriously gave me nightmares and I just wish they were done in a different, less graphic way.  I guess there is violence toward everyone, and that is supposed to be realistic, but what stopped me from going on past book 1 and what may stop me from going on in the series was some of these sickening scenes I just really didn't want to be apart of.

6543867,2,B00M0GMC26,"I was looking very much forward to the series as I have read every novel D. Gabaldon has written as well as recommended 'same' to several close friends.  Yes, I realize that film versions of novels almost always stray from and/or are forced to condense the original. . however, in this case it seems to me that the script writers have 'ripped and torn' the original story so much that it is hard to recognize the book vs. film version as having come from the same source.  I, as well as my close friend who also read the entire series, were very, very, very disappointed in the first first film series.  From the very beginning, the film is so far from the original it is ridiculous.  Yes, out of curiosity, we will watch the entire video series, as they become available - just to confirm that the script writers apparently were smoking something as they created their entirely different saga, however, if subsequent releases are as different from the orig. script, I do not see how anyone who views them will have any idea what Diane's original absolutely riviting, exciting, candle burning epochs were all about.

6543878,5,B00M0GMC26,"I commend & appreciate the research, the truth & the reality that Diana portrays in her books.  I get that people are tired of violence and sex on tv today, but this is a story that takes place in the 18th century and we haven't the faintest idea of what the conditions were truly like.  I think Outlander gives us a more realistic description, one that is hard to fathom amid all of the comforts we enjoy today!  Times were violent and sometimes good people had to become violent to survive.  I've read a lot of Scottish history (being Scots/Irish) and the atrocities reaped upon the Scots by the English is something none of would ever want to experience, maybe such scenes (Jamie being flogged or the attempted rape on Claire on more than one occasion) should make us appreciate our more modern day world, where people are held accountable for their actions.  Other historical (if you can really call them that)/romance novels don't give a realistic view of the period & tends to give readers this romantic idea of how wonderful it would be to live in those times, that everything  smells like roses.  The reality of 18th century smells would probably kill us ""Outlanders"".  I love Claire, the unforgettable heroine..she is a strong woman living in an century where women were seen but not heard, yet she never loses her strength and uses it to survive in this foreign world she is flung into.  As for the sex scenes, if anyone has read the books, you know that these scenes are creating the most extraordinary love story between 2 people that never should have been.  I've read the books several times over and never tire of them.  Now the series has come out and once again, I am not disappointed.",1429488000,2,1702,4.602649006622516

6543891,3,B00M0GMC26,"I thought that Claire's character could have been better written.  She is happy to show her breast in each episode and there are graphic scenes, so be prepared it's not family friendly.  She also ends up with the young Jamie which is an odd match as she seems a good bit older than him and would be a better match for his uncle.  She seems arrogant and  condescending most of the time thinking she is smarter than everyone else, which she is not.  Her attitude catches up with her in the end of each episode.  Sadly, I didn't feel sorry for her when she was raped, which is a HORRIBLE thing to say!  She seems to have such a giving personality (sexually) and complete lack of respect for others that it wasn't at all surprising when it happened.  Also, she always dresses much nicer than all the other women in the show.  She even dresses better than the Lairds wife, which I think is rediculous.  All in all, it's ok.  It could have better.",1429488000,,941,4.350574712643678

6543902,5,B00M0GMC26,"Oh, God, what a ride!!!  I've read the entire book series twice so far and this TV series did not disappoint.  My husband watched it too since he has also read all the books.  He's an MD, reads voraciously, but doesn't care much for movies or TV.  Well, he loved ""Outlander"" and said that the show is as good as the book, maybe better.  This TV/book series isn't just for women.  There is violence and bloodshed and it's very much a man's world, but includes a woman who can silence the most manly of men with just a look.  Usually.

The Jamie in my head was not quite as good-looking and had longer, redder hair, but Sam is incredibly handsome and a very good pick for this role.  They even did right by Claire, but I keep expecting her hair to ""surround her head like a cloud.""  All the rest of the actors are more colorful than the ones in my mind.  This is one fantastic story, the actors are spot on, the pace is excellent, it's thrilling, sexy, funny, tragic.  You'll laugh, you'll cry... you'll even learn some things.  The only negative thing I have to say is that like Game of Thrones, this show needs to stay on the air long enough to get through the whole book series. I would watch it for the rest of my life, if only I were so lucky.  It's just so rich with real details of day-to-day love and passion between two people who were destined (literally) to be together.

If you've read the books, you'll be captivated by the series; if you loved the series, you will treasure your books and remember this epic saga for the rest of your life.  Diana Gabaldon is my absolute favorite author, and I don't read many female writers.  I'm not a huge romance novel/movie fan, but this is not just romance.  This is a love that transcends time.  For years now I've worn my gold wedding band on the right and silver Celtic rings on the left.  You'll wish your tall, loyal, faithful, auburn haired husband would protect you with his body, have a Highland accent and tell you what a fine, fat arse you have.  If you are on the fence considering the films or books, don't hesitate.  Just go ahead and order them.  But only if you like goose bumps!",1429401600,4,2145,4.320802005012531

6543913,3,B00M0GMC26,"I have read all the Outlander books*****, multiple times, and loved every one.  As I've read these stories, I have pictures in my mind's eye of the characters, settings, etc. I suppose I have my own movie in my head, a product of my imagination.

I know that an adaptation to film is not ever going to be EXACTLY like the books, it would be impossible. I anticipated this series, expecting great things and have watched all the episodes to date (4/19/2015).  The producers have done a wonderful job of recreating the period...many kudos for that*****, but I don't particularly care for the amount of nudity* ... how much is necessary to tell the story?  It seems that Claire is the only one without her clothes a lot of the time. I also do not care for the extremely sadistic and sick representation of Jack Randall. His description of whipping Jamie at Ft. William was beyond the pale.* Jack has problems for sure, but makes me wonder what's going to be shown later in the series...  Others have mentioned the level of violence. I expect that the danger and violence of the period is well represented.

Although I understand the necessity of combining characters and scenes to further the story, I do wonder about some of the variations from the books... sometimes they just don't seem to make sense.* And why are there scenes in the series that never happened in the book?*

I thought my biggest issue would be who played Jamie (along the lines of ""who's going to play Rhett in GWTW...""),"" but not so. Sam is doing a fantastic job.***** Sadly, I have to say that this is not the Claire I expected or imagined.* She is portrayed in the series to be generally bitchy and hateful most of the time, and I cannot reconcile this actress with the role of Claire.

So... will I watch it all? Of course. Will I watch it again? No. I'll go back to the books, so rich in every way.***** I sincerely hope that anyone watching the Starz series who has not read the books yet will do so. There is so much more to the story. I do hope Diana completes the story sometime before either of us die. I very much want to know how it turns out... but then, with time travel... is it ever over?",1429401600,,2173,4.428571428571429

6543920,1,B00M0GMC26,"I must say I have never been more disappointed in a video series that I have purchased from Amazon before. This is not quality entertainment. This series started with Episode 1 providing an interesting beginning but hints at the direction of the following episodes with the attempted rape of the female lead (Clare) by the English Captain. There is far to much verbal abuse and graphic violence against her in the following 8 episodes. The sadistic scenes with the Captain's aggression against her in 2 other episodes and his apparent disconnection with his humanity is not the kind of video that needs to be publicly aired without clear warnings of it's sadist content. This is an absolute NO WATCH for children, women with any kind of self respect and men with any kind of decency and sanity. This is a prime example of the worst kind of attempt to disrupt healthy relationships between men and women. I understand there are people who like this but as a business Amazon needs to clearly communicate the potential offensive nature of their offerings. My money follows the businesses who listen and who respect my rights as a customer to have some idea of the content ahead of time. I have been a customer a long time, have found the video offerings entertaining, safe, and educational in that time. I would like that to be my future experience.

6543934,5,B00M0GMC26,The program is very realistic and puts you there on site where it really happened back in 1746. To watch the first season and relish in the great visual sequences makes you hurt for the second season . . . too far in the future.

6543952,5,B00M0GMC26,"I had never read the books until I saw the first episode of Outlander.  I was hooked, from that moment on. I went out to the book store immediately, bought the book and began reading.  I have had one of those books in my hand ever since.  I am now finishing the 7th book and cannot put it down.  The TV version stays close to the book with a few changes.  But they are changes that I have liked.  It is just a beautifully well done series with wonderful believable actors and actresses.  I do hope they continue portraying the complete story through all of the Outlander books.  They have enough story line to continue many seasons, which,  my husband and I both hope they do.  I even enjoy it more than Game of Thrones and I love that one also. Outlander is one of the best things I've seen on TV in Years.",1429228800,,807,4.181818181818182
6543953,5,B00M0GMC26,"Based on the series of books by Diana Gabaldon, Outlander traces the life of a WWII combat nurse who goes on a 2nd honeymoon in the Scottish Highlands and goes back in time by falling through the stones.  Claire Randall was married to Frank and has spent the last five years apart.  Their decision to spend time in the Highlands before Frank takes up his new post at Oxford put in close contact to a set of stones that sends her back to  the time before Culloden where she runs afoul of Frank's ancestor Black Jack Randall and comes to be married again to Jamie Frasier.  Catriona Balfe is an excellent Claire.  She is a bossy, take charge combat nurse.  She is intelligent and resourceful enough to think her way out of the differences between the two times.  Sam Heughan is a good Jaime, although he does not really fit the book's description.  The scenery is beautiful and the scripts are faithful to the books.",1429228800,,914,4.496969696969697
6543954,4,B00M0GMC26,"I started reading the outlander series about 20 yrs ago and I have read all of the books.  I was hesitant about watching the series because  when a movie or show is made based on a book it seems like it is never as good as the book. But. I must say this time the series appears to be done very well. I have watched the first 2 shows and they are very well done
 However, there is so much that cannot possibly be in the show, so I do recommend reading the books. I was pleasantly surprised by the characters , they are very close to what you imagine when reading the books. The chemistry between Jamie and Claire is wonderful.",1429228800,,625,4.10655737704918

I was so happy to get the DVD set so I could pause the action in order to study any of the scenes more closely.  I am a sucker for the background goings-on and this is a great way to do that.  The extra features on the Blu-Ray version are well-worth the money.  Seeing the scenes that were deleted for time constraints, or whatever other reason, really helps to tie the story together.  I'm really glad Starz made this set available.  Now it's waiting for Part 2 to be released.",1429056000,,586,4.1875

6544037,5,B00M0GMC26,"I am a Diana Gabaldon fan and was thrilled to hear she finally turned her Outlander Book Series into a TV Series. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the show matches in my mind her books. I absolutely LOVE the show and I am trying to patiently wait for Thursday 4/17 to come so I can watch episode 11. Diana, keep it up we want more!!",1428969600,,339,4.074626865671642
6544038,5,B00M0GMC26,Incredible series absolutely best DVD available!  Recommend with all my heart. Have loved Diana Gabaldon's books for many years. Best screen adaptation from book to screen I have ever seen!,1428969600,,189,5.3

6544041,5,B00M0GMC26,"I read Diana's books last year.  Once I started them I could not stop until I had read all of them.  Then, I felt sort of lost....It took me a year to read them - the charactors were like old friends.  I thought of reading them again, but resisted the urge telling myself there is something else out there I will find and like just as well.  Imagine my surprise when a friend sent me a facebook post about a fairly new show on STARZ!  When I saw the word Outlander...I rushed to investigate!  Now I have viewed all 8 available on Amazon and had to call to add STARZ to my cable!!  I cannot wait to see what they have done this year.  I love the the woman playing Claire and am starting to like Jamie.  He is continuously a better person for having her in his life in the books and I expect so of the series.  Anyway, to whom ever is responsible for putting this into movie form - God Bless YOU!!!!  I love it!!",1428969600,,910,4.056179775280899

Can't wait to see the second season. My only wish is that the Producers would subtitle the Gaelic conversations in English.",1428969600,,290,5.326086956521739
6544045,5,B00M0GMC26,"I'm one of the millions of fans of the Outlander series who could have been seriously disappointed.

6544046,5,B00M0GMC26,Best EVER!!!!!! I would be putting it lightly if I said I was OBSESSED. I'd be happy to go through the rocks myself if it led me to JAMIE!!!!,1428969600,,141,3.896551724137931

6544056,5,B00M0GMC26,"Fabulous series. Can't say enough about how much I love it!
It's pretty much like watching a series of one-hour movies of period action/drama, with a female protagonist and point of view. Unique tv IMHO.

Hate that this blu-ray isn't multi-zone. I can play it, but my Windows HTPC struggles with it.",1428969600,,299,4.75

6544063,5,B00M0GMC26,"Though the first episode seemed a little rushed at first, it certainly maintained the storyline from the novel. I just wish that they were longer, or that there were more of them!  I had my doubts about the casting when I first heard who was to play Claire and Jamie, but let me tell you, I think that the choices were inspired.  My doubts weren't necessarily about the specific actors involved, more that the characters had grown so real in my mind from reading the novels that I didn't think anyone could bring them to life, so to speak.  Cannot wait for Season One - Volume Two, hope the magic continues!",1428883200,,607,4.45045045045045

6544072,5,B00M0GMC26,"The setting of past and present of the great Scottish highlands told through compelling and realistic stories are powerful. I enjoyed this first season greatly. I've read the first book and a synopsis of the second. I loved the first, but find the continuing story even more disjointed and over the top cruel and that doesn't suit me in the name of entertainment.",1428883200,,363,4.777777777777778

6544083,3,B00M0GMC26,"I have been a fan of the OUTLANDER series since it was first published.  The production is beautifully done, magnificent scenery and costuming, but I can't wrap my head around the changes to the story, and the fact that, for me, the actors (not all, just some) just don't pull off the written characters personalities, and while some are fantastic - others just lack so much.

I can't say that I love this series on film, because I don't.  There are just  too many changes to Diana Gabaldon's beautifully, wonderfully, magnificently crafted story. Claire isn't Claire - Jamie is ok, Black Jack is AWESOME (Tobias Menzies hits it dead on).  Just hate the story line changes and can't get into it.  Give me the books any day!",1428883200,23,723,4.653543307086614

Personally, I think the interpretation from book to TV series is outstanding! The characters are wonderful. Claire is tough and strong-willed but still a beautiful young woman.

6544092,5,B00M0GMC26,I absolutely love this series.  My daughters tried to get me to read the books years ago but never had the time.  I missed out on many years of Jamie Fraser.  I have watched every episode around 10 times.  I love the costume designs and love looking at the castle decor.  This will go down in history as the greatest love story.  We should all be so lucky to have a love like theirs.,1428883200,,383,4.108108108108108

6544099,5,B00M0GMC26,"My daughter got me into reading the books because she knew Outlander was coming to television.  I was hooked by the time travel, history, and scenery, and the out of time love story.  Then it came to Starz and I watched the first book being brought to life.  Then I added the breath-taking scenery to my lists of why I love the stories.  I am so pleased that the dvd is available from Amazon (as well as the books). The matted picture was a nice addition to the purchase.",1428883200,,471,4.258426966292135
6544100,1,B00M0GMC26,"I really enjoy stories set in this era, about wars, nurses, and time travel, so I was really excited about this show. However, I was very disappointed. The storyline is very slow and boring and I do not care to watch sex scene after sex scene. Three in the first fifteen minutes is too much. Get on with the story already! I tried multiple times to make it through this episode and just ended up turning it off and cutting my losses. Glad that I only purchased the first episode and did not waste my money on the whole season.",1428883200,34,526,4.27

The publicity department and ads also show a cast that gets along well and has a lot of humor - this is great, especially if they  get a nice long run through the books. I love the photography and beauty. The tiny attention to detail on the sets is a delight - there is a beverage glass that I want a set of (boy could they make money with that along with miles of tartan fabric). Years ago there was a site online and women would draw their idea of Jamie - it was so diverse and fascinating - Sam has the impish teasing smile and the gentle spirit that I imagined. And when casting Claire they got someone with depth, passion and and eyes that talk. Also, the books were full of sex and this is done quite well in the movie - not over the top, and very realistic.",1428883200,2,887,4.0685714285714285

It is a modern love story that suddenly turns into a wonderful period piece in 18th century Scotland.

6544136,1,B00M0GMC26,"After watching the first few minutes of the episode on 4/25/15, I just decided I can no longer tolerate this show. Yes another graphically detailed, sadistic rape scene 20 minutes in. I realized that these scenes being shown over and over again in every single show...either in flashbacks (again) or new ones are truly traumatizing me. Why do I have to see a rapist slowly, slowly sticking his finger into the throat of his rape victim until she is gagging? Personally, I just don't remember anything this graphic in the books. It's been a few years. I was 40 when I read Book 1, and I know there was rape, violence, and sex.  But not a sadistic rape, flashback of rapes in detail, etc. in every hour of the book. Watching a sadistic rape is not healthy. These things really happen to people. The producer and director ENJOY this. They make these traumatic scenes last longer than they should. I feel that they are trying to brainwash women into thinking this is great and I believe many women are zoning out to get through those scenes so they can get back to the storyline before and after. Pay attention. I have been traumatized and zoning out during this show.  It took me too long to protect my brain from this. The books never made me feel violated at all. I think that so many people, including me, were so looking forward to someone getting the first book on film, that we are overlooking gratuitous torture of women in every single hour of it. It is just not good for us to watch that kind of violence towards women. And, they gloss over it like it never happened every time....except when Jamie shares his experience. Then, all must listen and feel so sorry for him and cry. Yet, worse has happened to Claire and the next show she is in bed having sex with Jamie and he never is upset that she was beaten and raped!

I thought it was still great the first episodes last year. But, I read most of the books (got an eye injury and can't read much anymore) and have been looking for a film of this book for years. Yes, the book has sexual enjoyment discussed, as well as brutality of the time period. However, I was very worried when I saw that Diana G. had sold this series out to a bunch of men involved in the movie biz. And I was right to be worried.

With two episodes at the beginning of this new season in April 2015, it might as well have been on some kind of sadistic porn channel.  Claire is naked and either being raped or ravished two or three times in one hour. It is really ridiculous. A woman who has been raped twice last week would need compassion the next week. Then the second, they have one character (a woman of course) getting naked in a ceremony orgasmically undulated at the moon. Breasts, breasts, everywhere breasts. It is getting ridiculous.

AND it is not following the book like it could. Last week, they had Jamie narrating the episode. I don't remember that. The last show before the new ones, they showed what Frank ""would be"" doing after Claire disappeared according to the producer. I watched a short extra of the producer talking about it. HE had decided that they needed to show what Frank would be doing. Then, Jamie narrating one week. Claire is getting weaker and weaker and more and more naked and crying out in ecstasy or agony every five minutes. It is ruining it for me at this point. I got a good deal on Starz for the next year. I will be watching for good movies, I guess because Outlandish is now removed from my DVR.

There is so much more to this from the history, the strength of Claire, and the intelligence of the books, I won't be watching after yet another hour filled with flashbacks of the same beatings, women being hit full on in the face with fists over and over, and another sadistic rape scene.  I truly can not watch any more of these S&M rapes and I am very glad that the CEO of Starz just got a giant pay cut.  Diana G. should be ashamed of this.

Follow the books. Is sex in it? Yes. But, not this neverending nonsense where women are naked and happy, or naked and terrorized, or naked and praying orgasmically to the moon, multiple times in every hour! It is obvious that men are in charge here and they are following parts of the book while getting to get young women to undress, undulate, and underwhelm those of us who loved the books and want to see them followed in a balanced, accurate way.

I am finished watching this show. It is absolutely traumatizing my brain and it really affected me today. I recommend that you pay attention and see how your brain and body are feeling as you watch rape after rape after beating.

The author sold out to some abnormal men with this. They are trying to make S&M rapes mainstream and hoping women will think it is sexy. It should be traumatic to anyone normal and paying attention to the effect this sexual violence is having on you as you watch it. I did finally and it's just not worth it. I will get the audiobook one day and listen to the books again. And hope that a woman will take at least the first book and make a good film out of it. I am becoming more frustrated with this series.  I can see why the CEO of Starz got such a big pay cut.  This is the only thing they've got and they are making it an average show.  The book does have the violence and rape of its time period and wars. However, to have one or two violent, graphic rapes in every episode is becoming so irritating.  Every single show has to have women with their breasts showing, and usually on the way to being raped.  A woman was not getting violently assaulted in every single chapter of the books!  The men who bought this from the author just want to see women getting assaulted or naked multiple times in one hour.  I could watch porn and see a lot less sexual violence.

I thought it was good the first episodes last year.  But I realized today that I have not been taking care of my brain and body health by watching this. I read most of the books 15 years ago (got an eye injury and can't read much anymore) and have been looking for a film of this book for years.  Yes, the book has sexual enjoyment discussed, as well as brutality of the time period.  However, I was very worried when I saw that Diana G. had sold this series out to a bunch of men involved in the movie biz.  And I was right to be worried.

With the last two episodes of this new season in April 2015, it might as well be on Cinemax.  Claire is naked and either being raped or ravished two or three times in one hour.  It is really ridiculous.  A woman who has been raped twice last week would need compassion the next week.  Then the second show last night, they have one character (a woman of course) getting naked in a ceremony.  Breasts, breasts, everywhere breasts.  It is getting ridiculous.

AND it is not following the book like it could.  Last week, they had Jamie narrating the episode.  I don't remember that.  The last show before the news ones, they showed what Frank ""would be"" doing after she disappeared according to the Producer.  I watched a short extra of the producer talking about it.  HE had decided that they needed to show what Frank would be doing.  Now, Jamie narrating.  Claire is getting weaker and weaker and more and more naked and crying out in ecstasy or sexually assaulting pain every five minutes.  In the books, she is tough, gentle, practical, loving, and sexual...in that order.  It is ruining it for me at this point.

I got a good deal on Starz for the next year.  If they continue drifting away from the history, the strength of Claire, and the intelligence of the books, I won't be watching the 3rd part of this series.  Follow the books.  Is sex in it?  Yes.  But, not this never ending nonsense where women are naked multiple times in every hour!  It is obvious that men are in charge here and they are following parts of the book while getting to get young women to undress, undulate, and underwhelm those of us who loved the books and want to see them followed in a balanced, accurate way.  I wish this talented author had sought out female producers, directors, and writers.  If the series continues to go towards the comical, it might as well be called ""Outlandish.""  Follow the books.  How difficult could that be?  Apparently too difficult for this man to do.  Sad.",1428710400,17,8285,4.362866449511401

6544225,5,B00M0GMC26,I'm a fan !  Highly recommend it.  I began reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series back in the 90's when the first book came out.  The STARiZ TV series so keeps very close to the books while needing to change a few things to make it work for Video audiences.  Can't wait for the rest of the season.,1428624000,,300,4.2105263157894735

I was excited when I learnt that the Out Lander books was going to be a series, but sad it was on cable and that I couldn't afford the extra money to have Stars.

6544229,3,B00M0GMC26,"This series was recommended by a friend.  While I can't share her enthusiasm totally, I have become engrossed in the story and want to watch the second series.  Beautifully filmed, it nevertheless contains a few scenes of shocking brutality and explicit sex that may offend many; it isn't at all appropriate for younger viewers.  My friend pointed out that it accurately depicts a brutal time and place -- early 18th century Scotland -- with imagination and breathtaking detail, which is true, but I have to wonder why it is necessary for the film makers to put so much blood, vulgar language and graphic sex (akin to soft-core porn) on the screen.  I'd rather have some things left to my over-active imagination!",1428624000,10,713,4.867768595041323

6544231,3,B00M0GMC26,"The best thing about this show is that John Dahl directs the first two episodes.  I confess my wife and I quickly gave upon this latest entry into the ""women who run with wolves"" as it is not our cup of tea.  The 1946 nurse premise is little more than a ploy to show the ""wounded"" hunky body of the actor playing the Jacobite era Scottish love-interest and to set up flashbacks of his flogging for trying to prevent two English soldiers from raping a Scotswoman.  The attempts at Scottish accents are laughable.  Perhaps Scots nationalists may like the anti-English angle.",1428624000,,572,4.633663366336633
6544232,5,B00M0GMC26,The video held close to the book. And you can really get lost in the story. To be able to show just how evil people can be and at the same time to show the power of dedication and love is very moving.,1428624000,,200,3.6744186046511627

6544236,2,B00M0GMC26,"I think they did a good job on the film version of the Outlander series. I did not care for the overdone/drawn out sex scenes. Too much sex and nudity spoils a good plot. I was especially offended by the oral sex scenes in the castle ruins (completely unnecessary and for a nurse who understands the importance of hygiene - sitting on a filthy table without underwear and asking her husband to perform oral sex on her was just too much for me - ugh! disgustingt!). I disliked the way the camera focused on nipples, genitals and derrieres. Gabaldon's books are soft porn. I would prefer that the television series focus on the story line (which is an interesting plot), and less on nudity and sexual escapades. I am concerned that when we get to Jamie's imprisonment and torture by Jack Randall, the TV  version will dwell on the sodomy, rape and brutality and not on character development. We need to experience things through Jamie and Claire's thoughts and feelings to connect with them emotionally. We need to know what motivates Doogal and the others. Strong story line, strong character development, tone down the graphic sex and violence, good amount of suspense and danger - that will make a great series.",1428537600,25,1212,4.7440758293838865

Dougall walked directly out of the book and onto the the TV screen, as did Frank/Captian Jack Randall.  The DVD seems to be high quality and the ""extra bits"" are quite interesting.

6544261,4,B00M0GMC26,"Love Ronald Moore's screen adaptation of Outlander. The show is awesome. The only reason I am going 4 stars is I am not a fan of the split seasons. Its a conspiracy for me to pay $80 for a show season and feel less bad about it by spending $40 twice. I also was not a fan of the special features. They were far too short, just as I got interested in learning about costuming and locations of shooting the feature ends.

Maybe with the next set there will be more deleted scenes and more indepth looks are the behind the scenes process. If not , then don't tell me you have behind the scenes features. 3-4 minute clips are not behind the scenes features, they are behind the scenes clips!",1428537600,,687,4.244274809160306

6544267,3,B00M0GMC26,"This is NOT a review of the quality of the DVDs or the series.  It is a review of the description of the standard (not blu ray set.)  I realized this was not the blu-ray set, but no where did Amazon make a differentiation that I could easily find that explained that this set does NOT include any deleted scenes and only includes 2 of the many special features.

I decided to order it as a standard dvd so I could watch it on an older tv with a standard dvd player.  I really was looking forward to all the extras and even paid more to have it delivered earlier for that purpose.  I tore open the package the moment it arrived and popped disk 1 into the machine immediately.  I love the series and I love the books.  These just aren't what I was expecting..,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UPDATE:  Amazon allowed me to return the standard  set I had purchased that is the review above.  They let me return the set postage paid, credited me back my cost, including the Amazon points and the amount I had spent for faster shipping.

I then ordered the blu-ray set from them and am THRILLED, even though I can't play it on our much older tv.  Fortunately my husband also enjoys the series and joined me in watching them in the living room.

I will do a separate 5 star review for the blu-ray version.  I plan on buying the 2nd half of the first season when it comes out.  This time I know to order the blu ray set.",1428451200,,1394,4.203773584905661

The only complaint I'd have would not be about the series itself but of Starz and the way they've marketed it.  First, it was a very difficult series to catch, unless of course you subscribed to a carrier who carried Starz.  Season 2, the Starz exclusiveness continues.  And second, it's only been released on DVD.  Whomever is in charge of Starz's distribution has much to learn.  I hope, like Vikings (The History Channel), each season gains a larger audience and the network is persuaded to put more resources and talent into it's production.",1428451200,,707,4.785123966942149

I can't believe how well cast not only Jamie and Claire are, but every one of the supporting characters.  And the scenery is its own character.  This series is gorgeous, well acted and very true to the book.  Where it diverges, it doesn't harm the story and I know accommodations must be made when translating the written word to film.

6544318,4,B00M0GMC26,"Fantastic series. I really thought this was going to be Harry Potter for adults, but it became more like Vikings for the UK. Great story. Unnecessary graphic violence, lingering too long on gut-wrenching gore. Gave me nightmares. Other than that, it was fantastic.",1428451200,,264,5.162790697674419
6544319,5,B00M0GMC26,I've been looking for a series that wasn't just blood and guts and tons of soft porn. After a while the violence and sexual gimmicks become boring. Having a great story is refreshing. Interesting plot and superb acting especially by the lead male who plays Jamie. All women really want is their very own Jamie in a kilt!,1428451200,,320,4.5344827586206895

6544328,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've ""studied"" the bookes many times, I'm still intrigued, learning something new each time I read them. Diana Gabaldon's work compelling.
The Outlander TV series is a magnificent ""visual"" rendition of the Outlander story!
The TV series episodes are well rounded with fantastic reality, and just different enough from the books to ""explain & provoke"" the intense adaptability and passon ALL of the characters have.
Ron Moore & his crew have hit the mark on costumes, screen adaptation, and character casting.
We have become a world that wants to ""see"" our dreams, stories and hero's ""In The Flesh"" the Outlander shows accomplish this beyond expectation. GREAT JOB!!
Hope Ron & his crew's interpretation & adaptation for the TV series are around for ALL of the books that's 8 plus years of viewing pleasure!!!",1428451200,,808,5.082706766917293

I am really, really liking it!  I have read the complete series and just need more Jamie and Claire time!  Another reason I wanted to see this series is so I can hear the words of the Gaelic language.  Reading the words doesn't do the language justice.

Do not like the 'Claire' actress - she barely registers any emotions or different facial expressions even while getting raped or attacked as compared to 'Jamie' actor whose facial expressions are spot on!  The supporting cast is also excellent!!  After seeing the first 'free' episode when it first came out I was very disappointed, however, I did download the entire first series recently once to came to Amazon and gave it another shot.  The remaining episodes were very good, although still too much nudity and sex, and I could not stop watching.  It also got me re-reading the books again.",1428278400,,669,4.9375

Moore's adaptation is very faithful to her story, and the revisions/additions have for the most part enhanced that story, showing us other viewpoints and expanding some characters.  The attention to detail in costuming and sets is outstanding, and the outdoor scenes shot in the Scottish Highlands are nothing short of stunning.

6544454,3,B00M0GMC26,"I read the series and the writer does a wonderful job with research and definitely has an excellent writing skill; however, she often rambles.  The only thing I did not like about the books was the graphic sex and violence.  I could overlook that in the books, but not in the movies.  This could be an excellent historical series that would be so good for a family to watch...entertaining and educational for children to learn the history of Scotland.  It is a shame that the producers decided to include such raw sex and graphic injuries.  Sex is a wonderful part of life that is private between two people that love each other.  All movies of this sort do is imply to young people that it is OK to have open sex in a room full of people.  Too many parents allow their children to watch anything and they grow up with a distorted view of what life should be about.  I shudder to think what the scenes will be like when Captain Randall rapes Jamie.  Producers seem to think this is what the majority of the public want to see, but they lose morality and ignore the fact that this offends a very large number of people.  I gave it a 3 because the story line is very good about Scottish history, but I am very disappointed in the scenes included that are definitely not necessary.",1428192000,24,1278,4.377118644067797

6544544,5,B00M0GMC26,"The story begins with one of the main characters in the 1940's being pulled into the past to the 18th century.  What drew me to the movie was the fact that a ""modern"" woman found herself thrown back in time to an era she new little about except for the fact that her husband was doing research on his family tree in Scotland.  They visited a place where there were ""standing stones"", (like Stone Henge) a much talked about place that the residence of the area said that it is a place where ""fairies"" are.  But who believes in fairies, right?  The woman is an ex-army nurse that is interested in different plants, so she decides to go back to the ""standing stones"" to collect some plants and hears the ""standing stones"" hum, she puts her hands on the largest stone, and poof, she goes back in time!  The relationship between the main characters is a love story with lots of twists and turns. The plot is very well written and the acting is very good, however, this movie is riddled with violence, language and nudity.  I was taken back by the nudity and graphic love scenes.  It is an adult only movie in my opinion.  I did love the story.  I just wish it didn't have all that nudity!!  I watched it by myself, so glad I did!!",1428019200,,1225,4.310043668122271

If you have the CD of this book, it is great to hear the language, but to watch it on DVD and see it is even greater. I will eageraly watch for each new Season when it comes out.  Having the 9 books she wrote I look for a long run of this show.  It is Great to have both the books and the DVD.  I wouldn't miss it for the world.",1428019200,,502,3.536363636363636
6544579,5,B00M0GMC26,"Yay! I think this is good! I did read the series, but after the sixth or 7th book I do get tired of them going back and forth between times, so I stopped reading because it no longer seemed like a novelty, plus Jaime and Claire were seriously like 60 and I wished they could just have a normal golden age together rather than all the shenanigans. However, this is a nice fresh re-boot, and I really like that although its not exactly as per the books, it keeps the flavor of the books. Yep, it's kind of racy, and hey, it's over-romanticized, but it's a really juicy end enjoyable story. Let's not forget she really started out writing romance novels and then the Outlander series morphed into something more mainstream fiction. But, I really like they kept the romance novel flavor in there and didn't make it too high-brow.",1428019200,,825,4.506666666666667

I was not prepared for the graphic nature of this series. Not my kind of show at all. I didn't make it past the beginning of the second episode.

Claire and Jamie will be having you looking for what twist and turns comes next.  Enjoyed all of the different characters and how it keeps you connected with the real history between Scotland and England in the eighteenth  century.",1427932800,,599,4.647619047619048

Also, I was grateful that the box was designed to hold the next set of DVDs, to complete this first season.  Gorgeous backgrounds and music--worth the price just for those aspects alone, but the story, of course, is great as well.  Much better than I expected, after all the recent ""adaptations"" of other wonderful books.  Much thanks to Diana Gabaldon for respecting her work enough to keep the movie-makers on target.

I love the production so far, and can't wait to see how they will perform the second half of the book, when the season resumes!  The deleted scenes and featurettes are fun to see, and I like that this Blu-ray case has room to add in the 2nd part of the season to the set, when that comes out!  If you are an ""Outlander"" fan, this is SO worth it!",1427932800,,409,3.9036144578313254
6544626,5,B00M0GMC26,"Arriving to the world of 'Outlander' 20yrs.late, I was not prepared to be overwhelmingly amazed by this incredible Starz series.  Catching up with it 'On Demand' from the very 1st episode, I was hooked & completely captivated throughout. When episode 8 left us hanging with Jamie (possible spoiler...sorry) telling Black Jack Randall, ""I'll thank you to take your hands off my wife"", I was stunned to learn I'd have to wait 6mos.to learn what happens next. I quickly went out to buy the book as I just could not fathom waiting that long. So now I'm hooked on both the Starz series & the books. Not sure if after 1,100-plus reviews here anyone will read mine, I feel I'm compelled to put my viewpoint in anyway. Many have squawked over the price of this DVD pkg. I'm sure if there's anyone out there as enthralled with this series as much as I, to have your own set is worth it, no matter the cost. Once you open & view it with all the bonus features, unless you are completely w/out emotion, you should agree. The B/R set is beautifully packaged in a slip case box with space for part 2. The 32 page booklet houses beautiful keepsake pictures & quotes from the show. The DVD's are to be found at the end of the book making it a complete pkg. Then as another bonus, you have the lenticular (3-D hologram) of the now famous 'Outlander' poster of Claire trying to choose between Jamie & Frank. The figures of Jamie & Frank interchange depending on what angle you're viewing it from. This can remain in the box or is suitable for framing. Blu-Ray is really the best way to go here as the colors & images are so sharp, crisp & clear. You almost feel as if you can reach out & touch it. The production value & the respect given the book is truly amazing. It's like Ronald D. Moore reached inside our minds, pulled out our visions & put them on the screen. Then tweaked them here & there improving on the book. The cast is letter perfect. Caitriona & Sam breathe life into Claire & Jamie, so much so one can never picture anyone else playing these roles. Tobias is astounding as both Frank & Black Jack Randall. It's amazing to see how he morphs his body language to fit each character. Dougal though described differently in the book couldn't be better cast here. The other star of this series is Scotland itself. The landscapes, forests, castles, villages, rivers & lakes (or should I say, Lochs) take your breath away. It's interesting the way this series is filmed. The scenes that take place in 1945 are filmed through an amber colored lens thereby muting the colors. In 1743 the colors are rich, crisp & sharp, making each scene look fresh & new. The land itself becomes a vivid character. The bonus features really impress with a behind the scenes look at how it all came together. I was amazed to learn that the original kilt from this period was 12 yards long making it versatile, acting as additional covering, shawl, blanket or bedding upon the land. To finally meet the enormously talented lady who started it all, putting an image & voice to the name, Diana Gabaldon, is truly a treasure. To hear her back story on how she created this incredible 'Outlander' world & how impressed she is with Mr. Moore's handling of her brainchild, will delight all. You can't talk about this production without including something about the music. Bear McCreary's music score is superb. He doesn't overwhelm the scenes with bold instruments. In fact he downplays a lot of the scenes for better dramatic effect. He uses a lot of Scottish instruments aside from Bagpipes that create interesting textures to each scene, complimenting it in a way that's remarkable. In closing, I don't know what else to say other than this Blu-Ray DVD Package of 'Outlander' is OUTSTANDING. To those who love the story, you will not be disappointed. To those who do not know the story, what the heck are you waiting for??? Last note on pricing, Amazon is the best way to go. The price came down three times from the initial pre-order price to the time it shipped, so I'm completely satisfied with all.",1427932800,,4072,4.562841530054645
6544627,5,B00M0GMC26,"I had never heard of Outlander until advertisements began to appear shortly before the series began.  I thought the young man portrayed extremely compelling, but did not have STARZ and did not want it.  About a week before the debut of the series, I received a phone call offering me a free three months subscription to STARZ.  Hello fate.  Naturally, I accepted and began my Outlander adventure.  That was September of 2014.  Before the first eight episodes had aired, I ordered the entire series of books and read them all.  (I'm retired, I can do whatever I want).  I loved the books, I loved the series and aside from the plot and characters, I developed an overwhelming desire to learn more about the history of the times.  And I especially loved the portrayal of the British army in Scotland as the ruthless, overbearing, arrogant and despotic maniacs they were.  I learned about the Jacobite rebellions, bought a tape of Scottish Gaillic, and 29 CD's from a folk duo called the Corries who specialized in the songs from that part of Scottish history.  Good on Diana Gabaldon and Ron Moore for bringing the history of the times to life, and good on the folks who bring the words and depictions of these people in such trying times to life.  The entire cast are perfect in their roles, the scenery is breathtaking, and they have managed, collectively to activate an interest in the past, at least for me.  Those who criticize for ""too much violence and gore"" have no idea of what history was all about.  Those who criticize about ""too much sex and nudity"" have no idea what life is all about.  Great series.  I hope it lasts through the eight books, or more, if Diana writes them, and I hope I live long enough to watch every season.",1427932800,2,1738,4.5941558441558445

6544666,4,B00M0GMC26,"I was sucked into this series from episode one! I love the story. It's such a simple, almost clich idea, and yet... it is done in a way that is gripping and suspenseful! The actors are all excellent! The story alternates between moments of suspense, romance and comedy, even. I won't describe the whole story; you can see that in the description.

What I will touch on is a few things you should know. One, this is NOT family friendly viewing. It's bad enough that shows feel like they have to show a butt cheek now and then, but this goes WAY beyond that. Be prepared for pretty much full-on nudity. Sometimes it is during heated love scenes, but sometimes it is just... there. For no apparent reason. Honestly, I really wish they'd done this differently. We don't need to see so much to understand what's happening. I prefer subtle references. It makes the show uncomfortable to watch, and I find myself fast-forwarding through half the episodes. That being said, the rest of the show is great! Although, I don't think Claire needs to take God's name in vain three or four times an episode. We get that she has spunk. Adult content for sure.

6544715,5,B00M0GMC26,"My daughter read the books, she tells me the series is close with a few dramatic flares.  I am impressed with the acting, cinematography and the story line.  Having had Scottish grandparents, it is wonderful to hear that ""brogue"" again as they fondly referred to it.  In this series they have some long intervals of Gaelic speech without subtitled translation.  Gives you a taste of how Claire, (Caitriona Balfe), must feel not having a clue what they are talking about. I can't forget to mention the music....if you like bagpipes you will be enthralled.  The music is truly beautiful!

Then I watched the first episode of this when they streamed it when the show premiered and I loved it.  I then went back and read the first book and thanks to the show I was hooked.  I have since then read all eight books before watching the second show.  Therefore, when I watched the rest of the episodes I considered myself a book reader and I was thrilled with the adaptation.

All of the actors have played their parts to the letter, making Diana Gabaldon's book come alive with excitement, suspense and, of course, romance. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to watch a quality program that makes history come alive.",1427414400,,316,4.763636363636364
6544802,5,B00M0GMC26,"Where to start on how wonderful this adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's epic series is? From the beginning! First off the production value is on par with some of the most grand productions in film and TV history, think Laurence of Arabia, Titanic, or Game of Thrones. The writing is spot on, while there may be some minute changes from the source material all changes are justifiable in making the material adapt well to the screen. Finally, the cast. Caitriona Balfe is quite literally the perfect Claire. While she may not fit Gabaldon's description to the letter, Balfe herself makes you forget that she's not medium height, that she doesn't have brown eyes, oh-- and in real life she's Irish, not English. Her performance is what matters, her ability to express what she's thinking and feeling with a simple expression. She commands a room, be it a room of Red Coats, or a room of Highlanders, Balfe is Claire-- and we're lucky to have her. Now for our Jamie, AKA Sam Heughan. He's everything we could ever want in a leading man! Intelligent, sexy, thoughtful, tall, and handsome. Jamie Fraser has become an icon in the minds of those who love Gabaldon's series, and to me-- as a fan of the book series, Heughan brings everything to his performance that makes him the ideal Jamie. I cannot shirk the supporting cast either, because they've all done such a fantastic job bringing these characters to life. But the man who needs to be praised until he goes home with every television acting award in the known world, is Tobias Menzies. He's playing two roles at once, in two different times in history, and next to nothing about either character is similar. From the moment Menzies makes his first appearance in the first episode, to his second-- where he's a totally different character, you are enthralled by his downright scary acting skills.

6544827,5,B00M0GMC26,"""Outlander"" is a great show! It's not only ""must-see"" TV, it's a show you can't stop watching. Sam H. brings the perfect blend of strength, chivalry, & gentleness to the charming & highly desirable Jamie, & he & Caitriona Balfe, who portrays Claire, have amazing chemistry.  The actor who's been cast as Frank is very versatile, playing both boring, bland, milquetoast Frank & the horrifically wicked Captain ""Black Jack"" Randall, a man so evil Hell itself would spit him back out. Even the Marquis de Sade himself would be shocked at how ""Black Jack"" delights in deliberate cruelty. When ""Black Jack"" is on the screen, he makes my skin crawl, so effective is the actor's portrayal of this heinous, despicable incarnation of violence, cruelty, & absolute evil.",1427414400,,760,4.984251968503937

6544858,5,B00M0GMC26,"I read the first two books in this series many moons ago and always thought it would make a great miniseries. I was really excited on hearing the news that Starz took up the challenge of bringing the time travel story to the small screen. I had high expectations for one of my favorite romance novels. I am glad to say that Starz has done an excellent job of bringing it to life.
Clair Randall, a field nurse during WWII, has joined her husband, Frank, for  a second honeymoon in Scotland. Frank was a captain in the regular army. They have been apart for long periods of time during the war and are using the vacation as a way to become reacquainted with each other after the end of the war.
Frank is interested in family history and is seeking information about one of his distant relatives that served in the British Army in the 1700's. He has meetings with a local historian/minister and they become friends. The group takes a jaunt out to a place on top of a hill called Craigh Na Dun, a supposed mystical site. After the group's initial visit Clair decides to return there on her own to investigate some medicinal herbs she thought she saw there. It is when she returns on her own that she is transported back in time to 1743 after getting too near to one of the monolithic stones that is perched there. She wakes up to the sound of gunfire and finds herself having to run from some British soldiers that start chasing her. One of the soldiers is the twin of her husband, Frank, and he threatens to rape her. He is stopped by a Highlander man that takes her with him to his group of travelling kinsmen.
From there the story takes off and Clair finds herself entangled in a web of intrigue. One of the Highland men has dislocated his shoulder and Clair, fearing the other men may do more harm than good, steps in and resets the shoulder herself. The young man she helps is Jamie, and he is the man she slowly becomes involved with romantically.
If you haven't read the books, then I don't want to give too much away. Suffice it to say that Clair is suspected by all of being a spy. She must find a way to get back to Craigh Na Dun so she can return to her own time and her husband. She is continually thwarted in her efforts to get away from the suspicious clan leaders, the McKenzies. Along the way she is forced into matrimony, but soon finds that she has fallen in love with Jamie. Black Jack Randall, her husband Frank's long lost relative, becomes her enemy, and the arch enemy of her 1700's husband, Jamie.
Special mention must go to Graham McTavish who portrays Dougal McKenzie, Jamie's uncle and war chief of the McKenzie clan. His portrayal of Dougal is spot on, and I wouldn't be surprised if he is up for an award for it.
All of the casting for the series borders on perfection. The characters are compelling, the settings are beautiful, the acting superb.
It is absolutely worth it to buy the whole season if you like historical romance. The nice thing about Outlander is that the guys can enjoy it, too. There is plenty of swashbuckling action to keep them interested.",1427328000,,3086,4.404553415061296

Great writing, direction and acting bring the 18th century Scottish revolt to life. The lives of the Highlanders and the English colonialists and their army of occupation are brilliantly portrayed.  As it was with 18th century life, Outlander is filled with graphic violence and sex. Its a wonderful story but may not be well suited for teens below a certain maturity level.

This (eventual) 16-part series is outstanding.  The cast, location, costumes and music really bring Outlander to life.  Tobias Menzies is particularly exceptional as Frank/Jack Randall, and has been able to persuade me to actually like the character of Frank Randall, something 8 novels has been unable to do.

6544916,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've done archaeology in Scotland, and enjoyed Diana Gabaldon's books. ""Doctor Who"" fans may appreciate that Gabaldon was inspired by early seasons of that BBC classic. Ronald D. Moore's production features an exceptional, intelligent cast; Scottish actor Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser, complex and wryly humorous. With strength and depth, Caitriona Balfe, while delicate, is remarkable as Claire Beauchamp Randall; she reminds me of Jessica Raine (""Call the Midwife""). Her first-person narrative is one of the best aspects of the show. Tobias Menzies (""Game of Thrones"") has intense range in the dual roles of kindly Frank Randall/his evil ancestor Jonathan ""Black Jack"" Randall. More Scottish greats are perfect here: Graham McTavish and Gary Lewis, authentic and spiny as thistle. The opening theme music, ""The Skye Boat Song,"" is resonant. The brave first episode is a standout, and scenes with Claire's apprehension over the Jacobite rebellion and the Battle of Culloden (April 16, 1746) are moving indeed. Occasionally, repetitive and cumbersome violence leaves too little to the imagination. While the books occasionally dwell on sadism, translating this into a visual narrative could be handled with more subtlety. We are looking forward to the next installments.

Over all it is a good show if your not too obsessed with the books, otherwise, I was slightly disappointed.

I think the jumping back and forth through time is done flawlessly. My one complaint is that it is too graphic. I think the sex and violent scenes leave nothing to the imagination. I noticed that it is not rated and I hope it carries a warning to parents. It is too bad because I think it makes it inappropriate for many audiences. Maybe there should be 2 versions.

It was also highly recommended by a few other family members.  Fortunately, we didn't have much going on as we pretty much binge watched the whole season in a weekend.  We both found it to be very enjoyable and entertaining.  The concept is a bit of a leap but makes for a great story.  It apparently follows the first book very closely.  They certainly have a lot of material if the series continues to be successful.  Judging from the acting, filming, and directing it should have a nice long run.  We both agreed it was vastly better than the $20 we would have spent on some iffy matinee and would highly encourage anyone to check it out.",1427068800,,763,4.4

The actress is Claire, the actor is Jamie, the cast is excellent, I'm hooked.  Please continue the show, make all the books into this exciting series so I can have years of enjoyment.

It is so easy to be lost in her inspiring prose and wit.  As to this series, I was shocked and horrified at the unbelievable display of brash violence.  Rather than focus on the better highlights of the story, the script writers and directors chose to focus on the exploitation of the most difficult of the subject matter, and when not engulfed in horrors, we are constantly riddled with nudity.  While the books are set in a historical time that was not easy for any one, the constant focus on this material of the most brash inicdents leaves me agog.  I bought the series, managed to get through it once and refuse to watch any more.  I don't feel that other than costume and music and the appearance of the characters have they done justice to the art of the story.  Maybe this is just a story that doesn't need full on exposure.  I can and often do recommend the books; this series is a thumbs down.  Sorry Diana.",1427068800,16,1093,4.3399014778325125

It follows the story line for the most part. There are a few things they either pass over completely or alter slightly for viewers sake . It's not entirely bad though. I actually quite enjoyed it

Having read the books, we knew what to expect, but were not disappointed in terms of ""predictability"".  Great action, great music, terrific scenery.  After the first couple of episodes, the repetitive intro gets a little boring, but it doesn't last long. I think it helps to read the books first because there are so many sub-plots and characters, the books help the viewer keep them straight. Plenty of simulated sex, tastefully done.  No streaming issues,  but you'll probably need 4GB of RAM to keep it flowing without pausing to buffer.  Looking very much forward to volume 2.",1426982400,2,675,4.826086956521739

6544973,3,B00M0GMC26,"EVERYBODY wants Claire.
Her first husband, Frank Randall, played by Tobias Menzies, left behind in 1945 after her time-traveling leap from post-WWII Scotland while the two were on their second honeymoon. (The war interrupted their first.) Her second husband, highlander Jamie Fraser played by hunkable Scot, Sam Heughan, who Claire finds on landing in 1743. And sinister sadist Capt. Black Jack Randall of the British Royal Dragoons, at war with the Scots, who is also played by Menzies.
There are also plenty of deserters and the like who would sample our fair heroines charms, willing or not. At the least, dialogue is often ribald; at the worst, near-rape and rape sequences are brutal and explicit. Creator Ronald D. Moore (Syfys Battlestar Galactica and Helix) leaves nothing to the imagination, including a gruesome whipping scene between Capt. Randall and Jamie (who spends a lot of time getting injured, then doctored by Claire). Jamies scars are often exposed by his kinsmen in an attempt to raise money for the Jacobean cause. Its not pretty.
We also learn the whipping became the captains pivotal moment, turning him into a monster. Every fantasy needs one.
The bestselling historical romance series by is a bodice ripper in the Sweet, Savage Love tradition. Savage love action generally works better on the page, but Moores screen adaptation slams us right in the face. When bodices are ripped open in Outlander, breasts pop out onscreen; the women scream and sob and other sound effects quash the comfort of the living room. (No one under 18 was invited to watch this in my home.) It plays like scenes from Game of Thrones without the intrigue or keep-em-guessing plotlines. The only thing driving Outlander is Claires attempt to return to the 20th century and Frank  until she is again distracted by handsome Jaimie, who dotes on her every breath.
The extreme violence is probably intended to keep male viewers from turning the channel, another ick-factor. Then again, maybe its supposed to balance dialogue like, I feel like God Himself when Im inside you. Bless them, Heughan and Caitriona Balfe, who plays the plucky and delectable Claire, do the best they can with dialogue like that. Again, what works on the page doesnt always play onscreen; the fantasy crumbles.
If this were fanfiction, Claire would be the designated Mary Sue, a beautiful, independent girl-maverick, the object of every mans desire and womens envy. Claire has the requisite smarts: She is a former British Army nurse, whose medical skills and combat-wound experience put her far ahead of her 18th century surroundings  and should create charges of witchcraft later, warranting a rescue. She also knows her history, enough to predict events  and get herself in trouble from which, again, shell have to be rescued.
This has been a staple of the romance genre for generations, from Jane Austen to Rosemary Rogers to Diana Gabaldon  and its not such a bad thing. No more so than for those who get their kicks out of criminal procedurals, cop shows, Westerns or medical series.
And no one is having more fun with Starzs new series than Gabaldon herself as we see in the bonus feature, An Epic Adaptation. A former scientist, she says she always knew that I was supposed to be a novelist. At 35, she decided shed better get to it. Her first novel was supposed to be for practice, and not intended for publication. Inspired by a Doctor Who rerun featuring a handsome, kilt-wearing Scotsman from 1745, she let her imagination run wild, did her research and put it all on paper. The manuscript was not only published, she tells us, but earned a three-book contract that began an epic, bestselling series and a solid fan base. Initially published as Cross Stitch in 1991, it won the Romance Writers of America RITA Award for Best Romance. There are now eight books in the series.
Outlander, long considered unfilmable because of its intricacies and length, as well as its blend of history, romance and science fiction, is ripe for adaptation due to the critical and commercial success of material like Peter Jacksons Tolkien films and George R.R. Martins Game of Thrones series. Like those films, much depends on fantastic locations, characters, and costumes. If you love a showcase, youll love the visuals of Outlanders 1080p MPEG-4 AVC presentation. Filmed in Scotland, where locations include Doune Castle, Blackness Castle, Falkland and Culross, scenery and sets are jaw-dropping gorgeous. Costumes by Moores wife, Terry Dresbach, a longtime fan, and Glenne Campbell, are stunning. The Dresses and Kilts of Outlander feature explores how they were designed and made. The costume department alone takes up a third of an acre, Gabaldon says. Theres one whole room devoted to embroidery. There are manikins strewn all over the place [and] enormous racks of 18th century clothing.
Dresbach, whose research began 20 years ago when she first read the books, says, Were doing a lot of hand-sewing. Theres no zippers, theres no Velcro, theres no snaps. Corsets are laced together. Things are made as close as they possibly can to the way they were [historically] made.
Indeed. It sometimes looks as though the fabrics were woven by hand, and the detail comes through in Sonys presentation. We also get a lesson on the history of pockets, and how to wear a kilt.
Sound arrives via a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track providing a solid immersive effort, where dialogue comes through cleanly against near-constant ambient sound. (A subtitle option will help those who have trouble with the accents.) The score comes from the super-talented Bear McCreary, who gave us the music for The Walking Dead and Black Sails. His music is compelling and memorable, especially the haunting, Skye Boat Song, with vocals by Raya Yarbrough. Somebody give this man a feature film.
The DVD only shares An Epic Adaptation and The Dresses and Kilts of Outlander. Additional extras  all in HD  Casting Outlander, On Location: Castle Leoch and the Magic of Scotland, Emerging a Scot: Cast Goes to Boot Camp, A Walk through the Sets and Stages with Ronald D. Moore, and 21 deleted/extended scenes are only available on the Blu-ray. Most of the featurettes are light, short and, too frequently, self-congratulatory; the deleted scenes are definitely a bonus.
Fans are loving the adaptation  and Starz gets major kudos for taking it on. What they won't like is the double-dip Sony goes for in presenting a Volume One of the first eight episodes of a 16 episode season. They won't much like the time it takes to go from feature to feature either, where the Blu-ray player nearly seems to stop. It is unreasonably long.
There are definitely elements to enjoy in Outlander; others that destroy the fun and left my audience cringing. Im hoping Moore and his crew lighten up by Season Two. Theres no need to show us everything. Seriously. Until then, the second half of Season One premieres April 4 on Starz.

6544976,5,B00M0GMC26,"Captivating drama, if a little unusual, at least for the participant.",1426896000,,69,5.363636363636363
6544977,4,B00M0GMC26,"I was 13 years old when I found Outlander under my mom's bed and was immediately enthralled. I had to read it, and subsequent books, in secret--much of the material isn't particularly appropriate for a young teenager--but I've been an avid fan of the Outlander series ever since. As a result, to say that I was ""excited"" when Starz decided to take the books and make a television series would be an understatement.

Now, I know that books can't be translated exactly into television, and that some changes are necessary for the flow and progression of the show. However, due to the almost cult-like following that Diana Gabaldon's books have engendered, it's inescapable fact that a large percentage of viewers will have read the books, and that the drawing of comparisons between the books and the show is inevitable. For the most part, I think that the show does a fantastic job of staying true to the books while also creating a visually, psychologically, and emotionally enrapturing picture. The actors, as a whole, have done a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life; while I had a hard time connecting some of them to their beloved literary counterparts in the beginning, it's now come to the point that I can't picture them as anything else. I think that's a sign of very good acting. The setting, the music, and the costumes are equally stunning.

As for the changes from the books, they mostly fall into three categories for me. Changes that I love include the further development of Frank's character and his relationship with Claire. In the book, their relationship feels almost like an afterthought. The additional attention to Frank's story in the television series makes him a much more compelling figure, and lays a strong foundation for Claire's desperate attempts to return to him. I LOVE Tobias Menzies' portrayal of Black Jack Randall; he's fascinating and appealing and repulsive and evil and pitiable all rolled into one compelling package. Thus far for me, Menzies is stealing the show. I'm also a big fan of the use of Rupert and Angus for comic relief. Changes that I am reserving judgment on for the time being include Claire's ring. While the mysterious key story line is all well and good, does this mean that we'll miss out on the powerful ending scene from Dragonfly in Amber? I sure hope not.

The biggest (and really only) disappointment for me, and the reason I've given this show 4 stars instead of 5, is that Jamie and Claire's characters have lost a good deal of the charm and wit and banter that they displayed in the books; quite frankly, they come across as a bit whiny and annoying on screen. I think this is more a result of the writing than the acting, but I'd love to see more of the ""true"" nature of Jamie and Claire come through in later filming.

This being said, I've watched Season 1, Volume 1 in its entirety multiple times, and am anxiously awaiting its return on April 4th. As a complement to the book series, Outlander is very good; as a stand-alone show, it's fantastic. As the story and the characters mature and come into their own, it's my hope that a bit more of the essence of the books comes through, but either way, I'm a devoted fan. And for the love of God, Starz, please no more 6 month mid-season breaks. It's pure torture.",1426896000,7,3295,4.675862068965517

6544986,5,B00M0GMC26,"I admitted to my obsessive behavior toward all things Outlander in my review title. YES, I'm prejudiced. I began reading the Outlander series 1 1/2 decades ago. Now I own all books in hardcover, first editions, signed by the author. This DVD series holds to the great adventure style of the books. The books are 800 to over 1000 pages each, so plenty of material to continue DVDs for decades, beyond my lifetime, unfortunately.

Everyone else has given the details of the suburb cast, cinematography, writing, costuming, props, choreography, and even down to what is NOT under the kilts. Top notch, as I knew it would be. Diana Gabaldon would allow nothing less.

JUST HOW GOOD IS IT?
I will wear out my Season One-Vol One DVDs before Volumne Two is released. Every time you watch, you see and hear something new. Too much to take in with only one viewing. It is a must own series, like the books.

With hundreds of good reviews ahead of me, I'll likely get no helpful vote, but at least I've done my duty for all the enjoyment I've had over the years due to the bonnie lass Gabaldon. Ta.",1426896000,3,1088,4.5126903553299496

Claire comes across very headstrong sometimes, specially in some of the scenes introduced new (not on the book), that kind of made me not like her character sometimes. I loved the music, the costumes, the scenery. It is beautifully made, makes it worth the watch. I really liked the actor portraying the part of Jaimie, he does do a good job. Also it is very easy to dislike Captain Randall, he is played well and the contrast between him and Frank is well done.

The beginning of the movie was not in the book, but after all the flashbacks of Clair and her husband meeting and in the army it was pretty much, and in some places, word for word by the book.  It did get a bit slow in some places, but picked up well enough.  Looking forward to purchasing the next season (we don't have TV).",1426809600,,466,3.989247311827957

I was right -- the Outlander  novel far surpasses the intensity, emotion, drama, and engaging plot of this mediocre series. The series is watchable for a mindless night of television, but not exceptional. I would rate it four stars for ""entertaining if not exceptionally engaging television"" except for one issue which makes the series nearly non-watchable: the accents of the characters. I realize that for authenticity purposes the characters have thick Scottish brogues, and I do appreciate that bit of detail. However, the accents are too much. They're too thick, making it difficult to understand what many of the characters are saying. I'm afraid I miss a lot just trying to figure out their words through the accent, and Amazon Instant Video doesn't make rewinding easy.

I think it is tasteful and well done.  I cannot wait for the rest of season 1 to come out.,1426636800,,583,3.778688524590164

They stay true to the books and have found actors that make the characters real - the way I saw them in my head as I read the books. Can't wait for the new season.

6545076,5,B00M0GMC26,"I have read almost all of the Outlander series books (still need to read the final one); and I usually dislike, with varying degrees of intensity, filmed adaptations of books that I like. So I was very leery of this project -- but they have done an excellent job.

My one quibble is the actress playing Claire. Not her acting -- she captures Claire's spirit, her intelligence and fierce independence, perfectly. But in the books, Claire's appearance is frequently remarked upon. It's not only her speech and accent, but her looks, that mark her as a very un-Scottish Sassenach. Caitriona Balfe, on the other hand, who is Irish, could perfectly well be a Scot.

It would have been lovely if they could have found an actress who had the right look for the part; but it's far more important, imo, to have the right person for the character's essence, so in the end it's a minor quibble. Sam Heughan makes a perfect Jamie Fraser: not just a big, braw, redheaded force of nature, but the intelligence, humor, and integrity at Jamie's core. Tobias Menzies handles the tricky dual roles of Frank and ""Black Jack"" Randall superbly--even though I know it's the same man, it doesn't feel like it during their respective scenes.

All the supporting cast are solid as well, as are the technical details of sets, costumes, makeup, and the like. The series is filmed in Scotland, giving us gorgeous scenery as a backdrop for the action. The writers have taken key elements from the books and woven them together into a narrative that works for television. It's not a scene-by-scene reproduction of the first book, but it's true to the story Diana Gabaldon told. Even the title song that runs over the opening credits (The Skye Boat Song) is perfectly chosen.

I binge-watched the first half of Season 1, and will be impatiently waiting for the second half to become available on Amazon. (If I could subscribe just to Starz without signing up for a whole cable package, I'd do it, just to watch the episodes in real time.) If you're a fan of Gabaldon's books, I think you'll be pleased with the job that's been done here. If you've never read the books but appreciate lushly produced historical fiction, then Outlander is well worth exploring.",1426636800,,2228,4.734536082474227

6545121,5,B00M0GMC26,"I would give this 1,000 stars if I could! There is time travel and adventure, there is deceit, there is love, there is graphic violence, there is the misty and majestic beauty of the Scottish highlands, and there is so much freakin' tartan.

Outlander is just gloriously beautiful. Hats off to the DP and production design. Most scenes look like they are set in a Vermeer painting. There are gorgeous landscape shots of Scotland, but it's really the sets and costumes that pull you into the 17th century (as well as into the post-WWII period). And the cast is absolutely stellar. Everyone is so true to form; there is no overacting here.

I am a big fan of the books, and I've got to say that, like Game of Thrones, Outlander stays true to the original while at the same time creating something new. Maybe even better. It's far less romance novel-y than the book. You do get the love story of Claire and Jamie, but the focus of the series is more about the whole 17th-century environment and Claire's journey through it. I'm also impressed and pleased with the decision to flesh out Claire's husband Frank much more. In addition to also playing the character of Black Jack Randall in the 17th-century time frame, Tobias Menzies adds a whole new dimension to the 1940s-era Frank, who, in the books, gets left behind when Claire traveled through time and is pretty much written out of the story. All the other characters ring true, too, especially the minor players, who emerge as distinctive individuals and make this world seem so real. Every character just shines, and the attention to detail sends me falling headlong into this world with each episode. I am on the edge of my seat every time, even on repeat viewings.

This is historical fiction at its finest, and it's like crack cocaine for anyone with a fetish for costumes, Scotland, or the many varied accents of the British Isles.",1426464000,2,1888,4.680722891566265

6545158,5,B00M0GMC26,"I read all the Outlander books a few years ago and then read them again.  I absolutely loved the books and Jamie Fraser is still my favorite hero out of all the romance novels I've read.  Like most fans, I wanted to see the books come to life either in a motion picture or a great TV series.  I always doubted anyone could do justice to the stories.

Finally, it was announced that Starz would be producing a  series based on the Outlander books.  During all the promos leading up to the release of the series, I was so disappointed at the choice of Sam Heughan to play Jamie, I decided to simply ignore the entire process and move on with other enjoyable reading.  Since I basically quit watching TV a few years ago, I figured I could just do without the frustration of seeing my Main Man, Jamie, be portrayed by someone who appeared wimpy compared to the way he had been portrayed in the books.

Yesterday I had to spend the day at my daughter's home to wait on a delivery of flowers.  I decided to see if she had Starz available on her cable.  She did.  I watched the entire First Season Outlander Series through Episode 8.  My, oh my - did the series match the books?  Absolutely, one of the most authentic productions with characters, scenery, language and background elements brought to life from the pages of a book I've ever seen.

And, although I rarely watch television, I've collected my share of DVD's of movies and TV series based on books and even been captivated by a few - namely: ""Roots,""  ""Pride and Prejudice (BBC),"" ""Emma,"" ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""LOTR,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" and many others.  To say that Outlander has outshone all of them relative to sticking with the heart and soul of the book, would not be an overstatement of my opinion.

Yes, I am now a fan of Sam Heughan although I still believe a bit more brawn would have been closer to the Jamie in the books.  Still, he portrays Jamie true - sweet brave young man who will eventually turn into an unbelievably strong man in all the ways that count.  Clare, in the TV series has a bit more finesse perhaps, than the Clare of the books.  Still, she's awesome.  I didn't care for all the nudity displayed between Clare and Frank and later between Clare and Jamie.  I'm not a prude and I didn't exactly find the nudity erotic - still, I'm of the firm belief, stories can be portrayed without so much nudity.

A strong five star rating for this production.",1426291200,,2426,4.426636568848759

6545171,5,B00M0GMC26,"There are not that many book to film adaptations that are this well done.  The film makers with advice from the author, have done an excellent adaptation, a very exciting story and beginning romance.  Story draws you in further and further until you start to be quite invested in the characters and hoping for, particularly, the Scots, survival in dangerous times.  I would rather the film did not spend as much time in the 20th C, nor go back and forth between centuries, which it does, a fair amount more than the book does.  The story and its accurate historical details is delightful once it is firmly rooted in 18t C. pre- Battle of Culoden, Scotland.  Wonderful female heroine, fine male characters too.  Recommend this film. And yes, I think i understand why the film changes some scenes around, in timing, or in small details for the dramatic effect of the screen.  A few really good lines are lost; other very fine one saved and go straight to film.",1426204800,,958,4.633136094674557

6545174,5,B00M0GMC26,This series is quite beautiful and the characters are pretty true to the books. Theyve taken some liberties with the events of the first book but I'm giving the series full marks because it stands as a good watch in its own right. I expect that it's difficult to pack into a single TV season all the details that are in the book. This is a good attempt at that and quite watchable and so far the show has been well cast.

6545175,3,B00M0GMC26,"I loved the books and had I seen this series before reading them, I would have given this four stars instead of three.  In the books, Claire is described as having a more voluptuous figure.  I expected her to be softer, rounded and more ""womanly"", not stick thin and flat-chested. Also, I now Jamie is supposed to be young, but he's also supposed to be a strong, masculine warrior.  I expected him to be more ruggedly handsome and not quite so pretty.  After watching for a while, Jamie's character does grow on you, but Claire just doesn't fit my mental image of who she should be, based on the books.  Even so, I enjoyed the show and will watch any future seasons that are released.",1426204800,2,684,4.44
6545176,5,B00M0GMC26,Absolutely love the series. They are following the book very well and have included just enough steamy sex scenes to keep the show interesting for both husbands and wives. We cannot wait to watch all of them.,1426204800,,208,4.648648648648648
6545177,4,B00M0GMC26,"Very nice adaptation of the books, as much as any video adaptation can be.  Of course, it misses the complexity that I loved so much in the books, so I can't love it.  That, and what is with the excessive boob shots of Claire?  I have no objection to sex but they could have used all that time with just a brief reference or two to her sexuality  (we get it, ok?) and instead included some more plot details.  I am very disappointed in the actress playing Claire, too.  She is a reasonable actress but in looks and overall energy, just does not match up to the written portrayal of Claire.  She could certainly use some better makeup, lighting, and photography angles to help her out.  I love the actor playing Jamie, who of course is easy on the eyes, does a reasonable job of acting but just exudes the ""Jamie-ness"" from the novels.  The scenery is fabulous.  Oh, and the Frank/Black Jack actor is fabulous.",1426204800,2,909,4.421686746987952

This was on par with a hard R in a movie theatre. The wedding night scenes were also ""rated R"" but more sensual than really explicit. Other than that the program has it all: romance, adventure, friendship and an evil villain to hiss.

Update: after reading the book I feel frustrated with the show because of the way it leaves things out and adds things not in the book. Still love  Jamie though.",1426204800,,567,4.603960396039604

The beautiful cinematography & costumes, the Scottish history, even the details from table to stables. Each cast member brings depth to their character. The chemistry between Jamie and Claire is amazing. Kudos to Sam & Caitriona! I had not read the books before seeing the series, but the preseason previews caught my interest. I started reading the book by the third episode. It was nice to have a visual of what the characters looked like. I was not disappointed with the characters cast. I am now on book three and impatiently waiting for April 4. I watched episodes on my DVR and am thrilled to now have the Blue-ray with all the extras (wish there were more). I've read some of the negative reviews and people are to quick to criticize about minor details such as eye-color, minor plot changes and porn (not even close) when they should be focusing on the original story line. The producers have done a good job of maintaining the story including the sex scenes with good taste. This series is far better than anything I've seen on tv in a long time. Keep up the good work.

When purchasing the Outlander Season One Blu-Ray version, I was so excited to see it I didn't read the entire description because of the price ($50 and change). I will enjoy every minute and will, of course, buy Volume Two when it comes out, but for many people, the cost is overly inflated for only half a season of any series, given the fact we are already paying to watch the show in the first place.

The tone is set beautifully by the title sequence. Dialogue is smart and authentic. The sets are filthy, the clothes look worn, faces are dirty- In short, they have created an extremely authentic look for the period. It is very easy to loose yourself int the story. But truly, the casting of Caitriona Balfe as Claire makes the show. She brings intelligence, sympathy, and strength to this character, and she is a joy to watch.

The scenery of Scotland is awesome and so is Bear McCreary's hanting music (he also scored the remake of Battlestar Galactica). If you are not familiar with the books, be warned: this is not a sweet sentimental romance. There's graphic sex and violence here and people get hurt, gruesomely at times, in battles.

6545230,4,B00M0GMC26,"Series is entertaining and I will continue to watch. I've read the series so I have a problem with casting, these characters, while good actors, remotely resemble the characters in the book. Directors go to the trouble of getting locations as close as they can, and the locations are beautiful, but if the actor resembles the character - who cares?",1426032000,,348,4.816666666666666

6545237,5,B00M0GMC26,One of the best stories ever. This is the first 8 episodes of season one watch the show and read the book. The show has some things added but they are fun and make sense like the game of shinty and wool waulking. Definitely worth seeing. I've been a fan of the books since the late 90's,1426032000,,286,4.035087719298246
6545238,5,B00M0GMC26,I love the series of books and I was thrilled at how close the series followed the book. Sometimes the film version bears little resemblance to the book but definitely not in this case.  I can't wait for the next episodes!!,1426032000,,223,4.439024390243903

6545241,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've read all of the books in the series and loved them. I wasn't sure how the series would measure up, but was surprised at closely they followed the book. It wasn't easy to find an actor and actress that could captured the multidimensional characters of Jamie and Claire, but they did a great job. I can't wait for season 2.",1426032000,,326,4.360655737704918

6545245,5,B00M0GMC26,"I loooove this series!! It's rare that a movie or TV adaptation does a book justice, but this one absolutely does.  The lead characters are perfectly cast and wonderfully acted by Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan.  They really capture the depth and chemistry that the characters have in the books.  The supporting cast, set design, story, everything really is very well done.  Highly recommended!",1426032000,,395,5.125

6545248,4,B00M0GMC26,It follows the story line well but a lot of the narrative seems foreign to the way the author speaks in the books. A really big part of all the books (I have read  all 7 of them) speaks about how big Jamie is and and how he towers over everyone and his long red hair;  but the person playing Jamie is just another guy with short hair. It is weird to watch him as just a guy when the book did so much to give him life and size and the video just ignored that part of the story.,1426032000,7,476,3.75
6545249,5,B00M0GMC26,"I didn't know much about Outlander, but the story sounded interesting. After reading some reviews, I decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did. This is a very good story, and very well told. My wife and I are enjoying it a lot.",1426032000,,231,4.043478260869565

6545274,4,B00M0GMC26,"I just bought and binge watched all 8 episodes that are available. I've read all 8 books (who else was totally floored that we're going to have to wait who knows how long to pick up the new book???!!!) and love the story(ies).  I realize that a few details from teh book just can't make it into the series for artistic and time reasons, but I was really disappointed with the casting for Claire & Jack. Caitriona's face is definitely Claire, but if you've read the books, you know that Claire has eyes the color of sherry. Their specific color is referenced several times throughout the series, and all they needed to do was slap some contacts on the girl, but no.  Also, again, Caitriona is beautiful (duh, she's a model), but she's got tiny boobs and a tiny ass (as beautiful as they might be).  Claire had the opposite. As for Frank Randall - maybe it's just my personal opinion, but that is not how I pictured Frank. He's, and I mean no offense, not really handsome. To me. THey did get it spot on for Jaime, though.  Some parts of the episodes were, well, boring. Like that episode with Jack Randall & Claire talking in the English camp? Like 20 minutes of snore-fest. I do love the series, so I'll keep watching, but I think they could've done better.  They should ask me to be a consultant, haha!",1425945600,2,1303,4.4125

My Blu Ray set listed ""play episode"" as a choice plus ""play episode with recap"" as a separate choice.  Even though I chose ""play episode with recap"" for each episode, there were no recaps for any episode, only the basic episode itself.  I enjoyed the recaps that were available when the series was shown on Starz and expected to be able to see them since that was listed as a choice and this was the Collector's Edition.  There were a few deleted scenes for some of the episodes, but no episode recaps.  Amazon is replacing the DVDs and I will be returning this faulty set.

If you have read the books you will be instantly in love with this, if not then please do and enjoy a splendid tale of Scotland and the people who inhabited it in the 18th century.  The visual effects are just perfect....Ronald D Moore and his  gang have done a superb job making the characters come to life.  Outlander is a period piece, a love story, a tale of strife and the conditions in Scotland during the attempt to restore ""Bonnie Prince Charlie"" to the throne.  I have been in love with the books for some 20 years and now to see my favorite story come on screen is wonderful.",1425945600,,746,4.285714285714286

6545296,5,B00M0GMC26,"I am an Outlander fan, a Diana Gabaldon admirer, and have now become a Starz Outlander FAN! Ronald Moore, Maril Davis, Terry Dresbach, Bear McCreery, and their entire production team have produced a television series for the ages! For once, page-to-screen has been exquisitely executed. I will be surprised if this series doesn't sweep the Emmys.
The Blu-Ray collector's edition was a must-buy for me so that I could make room on my DVR for Season 1, Part 2. It also gives me the chance to share with family and friends who don't subscribe to Starz.
Now, not to be ugly or argumentative, I do have a word or two to say to those who have referred to this production as porn. I am no fan of pornography, but believe me when I assure you that this in NO way can be lumped into that category. Are there violent, sexually themed scenes? Yes, there are. The book is full of them. Remember, a large part of this story takes place in 18th century Scotland. There are also scenes in which married men and women engage in love-making. All of these scenes are tasteful, and intrinsic to the story line. They are never gratuitous or exploitative in any way. Outlander is in no way, deserving of a ""porn"" label. On the contrary, it is anti-porn. I had no problem with my teen-aged son watching it. To me, I would rather he see something real like this, than most movies he watches that are mainstream, and catering to males, that are full of truly gratuitous and deviant sex. Leaves me wondering if reviewers who refer to it as pornography have ever actually seen real pornography.  Enjoy this wonderful adaptation of an equally wonderful book series!",1425945600,3,1638,4.590443686006826

6545320,5,B00M0GMC26,"Being a die-hard fan of the Outlander series of books, I had my doubts that the TV version could do it justice.  I am quite happy to admit I was wrong.  I think the casting is brilliant, and the writing does a great job of preserving the most important aspects of the books while having to make understandable choices in adapting to a serial, TV seasonal format.  The quality of the production--costuming, sets, casting--is outstanding.  I only wish the episodes were released immediately following showing as I live overseas and must access them through Amazon or iTunes and they're released as complete volumes.",1425945600,,613,4.922330097087379

Too often, series or movies created from books fall flat. Although there are always some thing that get lost in the translation, I am extremely pleased with how this was done. The casting has been amazing and there are touches throughout that really bring the spirit of the books through. (I particularly enjoy the overlay of 1940s music on the castle scenes, genius!)

Also as mentioned by other customers it was deceptive to find out you will not receive the 30page booklet with your Amazon order. Maybe when Sony puts together the second half of the season they could offer it and some of the other extras like Boot Camp and Casting for those of us without Blue Ray.,1425859200,,419,4.30379746835443

Season 1 contains 8 episodes and covers the majority of the first book in the Outlander series. However, the second season will still begin in the later parts of the first book.

The acting is outstanding and the cast does a great job of bringing my favorite characters to life; the story is pretty much true to the book; the Scottish scenery is beautiful, and the theme song is haunting (I've been singing it under my breath for the last two weeks).

Truthfully, when I finished watching the second disc, I felt like I had subjected myself to voyeuristic behavior and this speaks extremely low of the people putting this filth out as drama,
If you have not read the books, then i highly encourage you to do so.  I do not remember feeling voyeuristic from reading the books.  This series is mostly porn in content and is NOT acting nor does it adequately reflect the story I read from the books!!!!!!!
At least reading the books one does not feel one is subjected to another's voyeurism as Is the case with these DVDs.  Poorly done.  I will waste no money or time  on any future video purchases.  The DVD is over priced for the content.  I was extremely disappointed hoping I would see more than a few seconds of a scene where they were dressed and speaking, rather than the extremely long scenes of different sexual activities some sick person had others  perform so he or she might sit back and observe.

I just bought the first book and plan to start it tonight, and am counting the days until April 4th. WHAT a cliff-hanger! I can't remember the last time I was this excited about a TV show. I haven't had cable TV in about 10 years, so that'll tell you what I think of TV these days. I've told my husband I'll re-watch all 8 episodes with him, it is that good. Just brilliant! Don't mind any of the 1-star reviews - honestly, the ""soft porn"" is very tasteful, in my opinion.

What a bummer! I already have the 8 episodes saved on my DVR, I bought this purely for the extras. Damn. Still an amazing story though, love the show. Maybe they will hopefully release an extended version on DVD after the end of season one volume two and give all of us poor DVD users the extras we are missing in this set!

Sam Heughan has a wonderful Chris Reeve smirk, and his Jaime is still a Man's Man although not-so-much as in my paperback.  Claire is not as curvy as in the book but still sly. Caitriona Balfe is perfectly lovely in her own way, and nuanced. I like that Frank is still a repressed academic and Black Jack is not supressed and battle worn,Tobias Menzies playing it two ways. I read Dragonfly almost 20 years ago ""and the rest"" so my Outlander was steeping for two decades.

I bought the DVD, not the blue ray. The DVD special features are surprisingly short and thin, and with no commentary.  Because of my hectic life I saw only part of the Ep1 on Starz, so they are new to me here. In other words, I bought the DVD to see the show first-run, not to see them again.

So my husband and I finally said we'd watch it. It is very interesting for sure! Not that original with the whole ""going back in time"" thing but I really like all the Scottish drama. I also really like the strong female lead. It is a very well done show and is accurate to the books. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the graphics. I had no idea there would be 3 sex scenes in the first episode and there is a lot of blood graphics. I may be the minority but I really don't like seeing this kind of stuff. TV shows can still do a great job of implying what is going on without having to go in detail and show it. But this is something I will get over because I really do like the story line.

6545459,5,B00M0GMC26,"I imagine many viewers were like me, fans of the Outlander series of books who seriously doubted any movie or TV production could do it justice. And, as you can see from the ratings, pretty much everyone has been ecstatic about what has turned out to be one of the best productions in decades, and I include Game of Thrones.

The sheer beauty of the setting, locations, music and cinematography alone would have brought me back for more, but the actors!

Sam Heughan, as the man-boy Jamie Fraser, the heart and soul of the Outlander series of books, is perfect as an idealistic young man with the makings of a patriarch. The fact that he's handsome, masculine, very big, and very sexy doesn't hurt, of course.

If Tobias Menzies, in the dual roles of Claire's beloved husband Frank and the truly depraved Black Jack, doesn't get top awards I'll be very surprised. His Black Jack is truly the stuff of nightmares, surpassing my benchmark bad guy, Tim Roth's Archibald Cunningham in the movie Rob Roy. And Ben Foster's Charlie Prince in 3:10 to Yuma.

Graham McTavish, as the MacKenzie war chief Dougal, steals every scene he's in with his testosterone-fueled masculine power and determination.

And Catriona Balfe as Claire is wholly believable and surprisingly endearing in a truly tricky role. I had a hard time liking Claire in the first couple of books because of her in-your-face approach to life, and her constant waffling between Jamie and Frank, but Balfe showed just how gut-wrenching Claire's choices are, how sorrowful on one hand and yet full of possibility. I actually ended up rooting for a character I've disliked for decades. Also, she manages to be extraordinarily beautiful and yet look full of strength of character and intelligence. Impeccable casting!

While I'm not looking forward to the first couple of episodes of Part 2, because what happens to Jamie is truly horrific, and I know both actors will portray the dreadful episode with intensity and skill, but I won't be able to stay away because this is probably the most bone-deep satisfying -- and even uplifting -- production I've seen in years. It has the outstanding production values, complexity and dark undertones of Game of Thrones, but there's an idealism and beauty here, the lack of which finally made me give up entirely on Game of Thrones.

Later - DON'T miss the hour-long love scene.

I decided to re-watch the now-famous ""sex scene"" (you'll see why I have it in quotes in a second) and was blown away. Here's why: I find the sex in HBO series I've watched kind of sordid, about power and dominance and control for the characters, and about titillation and shock value from the behind the camera writers, producers and directors.

I was so braced against another experience like that that the first time I watched the famous ""sex scene"" I missed the true beauty and sensitive skill that went into what actually is an hour-long LOVE scene...yes, there was sex, pretty explicit, and there was plenty of careful nudity, but it was all about connection, and caring and...love. Very intense, intimate, lyrical and beautiful. This alone was worth the series price for anyone with an ounce of romance in her or his soul.",1425513600,16,3202,4.839122486288848

I read Outlander when it first came out so long ago and have anxiously awaited every book in the series.

 I have loved the books since they were first published and have read and re-read so many times.  I have watched every episode on STARZ (several times). I love the series - so true to the time periods, characters, story, and spirit. When I watch, I am in Scotland, lost in another time.

One of the aspects of her writing that made me fall hopelessly in love with the saga (and needless to say Jamie), is her ability to engage all the senses, not just the sweet smell of blossoms, the smooth skin of virginal heroine When reading the novels I could smell the sweat, the blood, the fear on the young redcoat, feel the texture of the thick scottish wool. It was never so much romantic as visceral and real. The sexual interactions seemed more about revealing the nature of the characters and their connections than about giving the reader a cheap thrill. While I remained sceptical as to whether certain scenes could translate to the screen with the raw honesty we loyal readers drank greedily from the page  without appearing to offer heavy doses of gratuitous  sex and violence, I am no longer so. The series seems to have finished the work of the books, etching the stories in my brain true as my own memories.  Thank you Mr Moore, Starz, wonderful Diana.

Apparently, there is an additional layer of security involved when played on a computer.  I hope to eventually work around this difficulty but, in the meantime, I suggest not ordering Blu-Ray if your computer is older than, say, two years.

My software attempts have been with CyberLink and VLC Player.  My computer is a two year old Dell running Windows 7.

So yea, very happy about that!! The photobook is really nice and includes scenes and quotes from each of the episodes.

6545531,5,B00M0GMC26,"Scotland is beautiful. I'm glad they actually film there because the country drives the film.  It provides a more enriching viewing experience.  Everyone is well cast with the exception of Claire & Jaime.  Catriona  is adequate.  Granted I've only seen the first 5 episodes but there are times I've noticed that she doesn't know where to put her hands.  A common problem with novice actors.  Her acting seems to be one note.  Her defiant face is the same in every scene.  At times her acting is wooden. However from what I've seen as she grows more comfortable at being Claire her range is growing.  Had she been a seasoned actress I still wouldn't cast her.  I don't know who they would cast but she's just not Claire.  The actor who plays Jaime on the other hand does a nice job in his part, but there is a stunning lack of chemistry between he and Claire.

Also in the novels the most distinctive part of Jaime's is his height.  Claire is taller than he is!  Overall I feel the supporting actors do a tremendous job at bringing their character's to life.  The casting of Black Jack had to have been difficult, there were so many obvious choices as with Dougal.  I read many casting suggestions on line with big time actors in the parts.  However the actors who were chosen are a little quirky but they're very good at what they do. I'm really enjoying them.  Other supporting actors are really a kick.  I can't wait to see Brianna, Ian & Fergus!

So over all with an intoxicating STORY, magnificent costumes, luscious Scotland, some solid acting and the set. it's wonderful to watch even if you haven't read the books which I strongly recommend; you'll love  watching this!",1425254400,,1676,4.572390572390573

Couldn't stop reading to see what would become of our heroine Claire Beauchamp and her highlander Jamie Frazier.  I remember speculating online with bloggers about who could play these two roles, especially that of Jamie whose physique would seem to be rare.  And yet, they managed to unearth this guy Sam Heughan and well, he is the one.  Claire's actress Caitriona is perfect too, although much taller than the 5'6"" character in the book.  Having re-read the book (and all of the others too of course) at least 3 times, I must say the Starz series is pretty close to the spirit of the original writing, and the casting is great, the epic romance scenes are well executed.  Plenty of nudity and love-making, swashbuckling fights and bodice-ripping, etc.  I wonder how they will handle the rest of the book, as I have yet to see the second release of episodes promised in April 2015.

It is amazing to have faces from the TV series to  add to the listening and reading of the ebook. I loved it all.

When I originally read Diane G. whole Claire and Jamie series, I had so much impatience waiting for her next book. She was so great with her stories. Her 8 books could have been 16 easily.

This is very well done, and although the show plot doesn't adhere to the original book perfectly, the film makers got the spirit of it just right.  The parts were cast well.  There were just a few exclusions in the adaptation that disappointed me.  I will say that the way they divided the episodes was reminiscent of the old radio serials, and I found that really frustrating when I was forced to wait a week for the cliffhangers to be resolved.

This series is like a dream come true and well worth the wait! It's so well done--from the choice of actors who bring the characters to life to the excellent screenwriting adaptation to the music to the costumes to the Scottish on-location filming. It's astounding--I highly recommend it whether you've read the books or not! (But do yourself a favor and read the books ;-)",1425081600,,489,4.6976744186046515

6545599,5,B00M0GMC26,"A brilliant show. Everyone involved, cast and crew are at the top of their game. I have never seen such a close adaptation to a book. This show is taking great pains to make everything believable by being as authentic to the different time periods as possible. The acting is just fantastic. I really can't say enough about Caitriona Balfe as Claire or Sam Heughan as Jamie. They were born for the parts. Don't get me started on Bear McCreary Original Soundtrack, it's a companion to the show and stands on its own.

Let this show transport you.",1425081600,21,544,4.551020408163265
6545600,5,B00M0GMC26,These series of adventures are timeless. The time periods of the 1940's to 1745 goes very well together between the British and the Scotsman.

6545603,5,B00M0GMC26,I absolutely love this series!  It has thus far exceeded my expectation of following the book. The characters are very well cast and costuming is outstanding. My only tiny issue is in understanding the heavy Scottish brogue. Guess I'll have to watch them twice to catch all the dialogue!,1425081600,,287,4.857142857142857

It is taking a bit of time to be reintroduced to characters I have 'known' in my mind for many many years.  They don't always appear as I had imagined. It is like the 1st 'face to face' meeting with someone you have only spoken to over the phone for years ~~ gradually they fit in right where they belong.  Great locations ~ Super costumes[fancier than expected].The subtle/ not so subtle additions / plot changes seem to be leading in the right direction so far ~ if they continue the series I hope they stay as true.  So many takeoff on a tangent that was not the authors original intent.  I am a die hard fan of the books ~~ we will see !!",1425081600,,862,4.107142857142857

Lovely Celtic music that runs through my head when I can't sleep nights (Thanks, Bear McCrory..) It's been so many years since I read the books that I'm not sure how closely the series follows, but the setting is wonderful and the characters finely drawn. Mrs. Fitz surely gives Mrs. Pattmore of Downton Abbey a run for best-hearted cook and mothering type in a series! Love her.

6545677,4,B00M0GMC26,"The episodes are very close to the book, which was outstanding. The Outlander books are filled with detail, developing the characters and lending nuance to the plot.  Claire is a great heroine. Strong, willful, loving, brave and with a sense of humor.  How she survives the terrible predicaments  the author places her in is beyond me.
Casting is excellent, as is the scenery. However, films by their nature with limited time frame cannot provide all of the details and character development which the books provide. Still, it's a great story and well worth your time. If you have not, read the books, get on with it.",1425081600,,617,4.80188679245283

Jamie and Claire good, Frank Randall not as sympathetic - just comes off to military-like and not as soft/professor like as he should be in contrast to his evil ancestor. over all enjoyable, definitely better at capturing the books than the dragon tattoo movies.

With only five weeks to go before the second half of the season airs, I wholeheartedly recommend anyone who hasn't seen Outlander to watch the first eight episodes now. You won't be sorry.
The story of Claire and Jamie will take you through the whole spectrum of emotions and give you insight into what constitutes a relationship that can survive everything the world will throw at it. At the same time, you will get a look at Scotland in the 1740's, right before the Battle of Culloden, which would change the Highlands forever.

6545719,3,B00M0GMC26,"for fans of the written books, it was a pleasure to see the characters come alive, specially Jamie and Claire.  I love to see Claire's commitment to nursing well represented and acted.  She is a good professional nurse through the first 5 chapters and not just a damsel in distress.
 Also the detail in costuming and settings according to the time periods is very good and enjoyable. I loved her gowns and platts.
 But in the last 3 episodes, I sensed a change of pace in the story, a slowing down that is not healthy for the running of the series, even if it is faithful to the book.  It is best to have fewer episodes better edited that a lot of time where nothing happens to further the development of the characters or the story.
Also for season two, could Claire be more interested in fighting back? Could to learn how to shoot and use a sword? She is a 20th century woman and we fight, shoot and use knives and swords to defend ourselves and what is ours.  Not to be aggressive but to be safe in  dangerous times.
I hope the pace picks up because I know there are more than a few books on the written series and it would be good to see them come alive but with the slow pace and poor editing we are not going to get the ratings necessary for HBO to continue.",1424908800,4,1264,4.198347107438017

6545727,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is just one of those shows that hooks you instantly & afterwards you can't get enough!!! I have to say everything about this show is amazing and the acting/casting is top notch!! It's set/filmed in Scotland which makes for the most beautiful & interesting backdrop. It really brings a different element to the show and makes the world of Outlander come to life! I usually don't like period dramas however Outlander has a bit of everything and it really can't be fitted into a single genre! I will tell you very few shows have ever captured my attention like this series has and I will forever be a fan!

 After watching the first episode I started reading the books and I'm blow away by how well this show has been following them. If your a fan of the books you will love this show because it truly brings them to life in really special way that is rare to see in any movie or TV Show adaptation. There has obviously been some changes made but nothing that takes away from the incredible story Diana has written (in fact some lines are direct book quotes or are very close too). If you have never heard of Outlander and are just coming across it like I was back in September, give it a chance! Really have an open mind because there are so many different elements that this show has to offer. So please let it surprise you! Currently it's only 8 episodes in but ever episode give you a little bit more and by the end you will be dying to find out what happens next! At times it can be slower paced but it's all about the build up. So just enjoy the journey because things start to speed up pretty quickly!

 Another thing to add is on-screen chemistry between Jamie (Sam) & Claire (Caitriona) is so palpable you can't look away for a second. It's thrilling to watch the relationship grow and strengthen as the show goes on because they're the heart of the show and their love story is completely unique!! Now with all that said keep in mind this TV show is on Starz of course there will be violence, sex and yes darker storylines! With Outlander though everything that happens has a purpose in the overall development of story and in my opinion is never pointless or over done(it's just not for kids or anyone who doesn't like that kind of stuff). Anyways can't wait for my DVD to get here because I've been re-watching every episode on repeat since October eagerly awaiting 1B. Super excited for hopefully many more seasons to come!!!! I have read all 8 books now & I can honestly say no one could have done a better job bringing this book to life 5 stars!!",1424908800,,2563,4.389473684210526

I was concerned that the actors wouldn't live up to my imagination or that they would stray too far from the books. I am pleasantly surprised. As is typical, in many ways my imagination was better. However, having never been to the Scottish Highlands, the landscape, villages, castles, and homes depicted in the tv show far outshine what I could imagine. They did stray from the books in some parts, as is necessary when taking a literary work to the screen, but in most instances they did a great job. I have very few complaints with the changes they made. I believe it's safe to say that I enjoy the tv series as much as I do the books, which is saying something, because I LOVE the books.",1424822400,,763,4.305555555555555

I think in some parts the show was even better than the book, some things better developed and I really liked that the creators incorporated more side characters making it funnier and really interesting. I loved Catriona Balfe as Claire, she is beautiful, strong and plays Claire with love and attention. Sam Heughan as Jamie is perfect, but everyone knows that by now, he is Jamie. I could not think about any better one. Every character is great and acted beautifully. The details are great. Oh, Black Jack aka Frank/ Tobias Menzies is very good. It is not easy to play such an abhorant character. Tobias made is so well. The book is very intense and the show brings the intensity. I cannot wait for the second part of season one.

6545767,3,B00M0GMC26,Yawn. And not faithful to the fundamentals of the book. Where's the war crime buggary? Looks like the monarchy had a hand in softening the character of Lt Randall! This is far kinder to the red coats than the book and way less bodice ripping. Rather boring actually. Claire was played nicely. Beautiful scenery and song.,1424563200,5,320,4.732142857142857

I was thrilled I started on the kindle because I could just keep going. And I did. I am not sure what happened in October 2014 because I was immersed with Claire and Jamie. That said, this series is as addictive as the book. The music is hauntingly beautiful, the costumes gorgeous, and characters perfectly cast. Thank you for this!",1424476800,,477,4.558139534883721

I had a hard time watching some of the scenes. That said, they made this about as real as they could and it makes you feel as if you are right in the story. It is NOT for young children or even young teens in my opinion.
I hope they are able to continue with this series on STARZ.",1424476800,,455,4.010989010989011

The series is a faithful adaption of the books.  It is obvious that Diana is working with the writers and actors at some level, because Jamie and Claire are true to their personas in the book.  The cinematography is breathtaking and it portrays Scotland as it should be, picturesque, wild and free in the highlands.  It is a wonderful series!  More! More!",1424390400,,526,4.725274725274725

Cinematography is breathtaking. You can easily get lost in 18th century Scotland. The acting is superb and I can't wait for the second half of the season.
I also want to note that even though there are brutal things happening in the show, overall the story is positive, romantic and has a strong moral undercurrent.",1424390400,,563,4.529411764705882
6545917,4,B00M0GMC26,"As an avid reader of Diana Galgaldon's ""The Outlander"" series books, I have enjoyed watching the television version.  At first, I was not happy about the actors that were chosen to play Jamie and Claire because they did not coincide with how they looked in my own mind and how they were described in the book.  However, I've grown to accept them.  The screenplay is very different from the books and that's been an issue for me.  For example, I don't remember ever reading about Frank's experience after Claire's disappearance, nor do I really care.  There are lots of other scenes in the TV version that were not in the books but I guess the producers have to decide what would entice viewers to watch it, especially those who are not familiar with the books.

6545929,5,B00M0GMC26,"I've been a fan of Diana Gabaldon's series of Outlander books for many years and I was worried how the jump to television would be handled but they got it right.  Of course it must be condensed and you loose so much detail in this format over the written word, but the essence of the story is there and the action and romance are definitely there.  The choice of actor for Jamie Fraser with Sam Heughan was spot on (be still my heart!) and overall I was happy with the cast - although Caitriona Balfe is not the Claire I saw in my minds eye when I read the books.  However, she is such a good actress that as I watched each episode of Season 1, Volume 1, I became comfortable with her in that part and I can accept her as Claire (except that her very blue eyes always throw me in the close ups - where are those eyes 'the color of whiskey?')

6545947,5,B00M0GMC26,"I love Outlander! I am a big fan of the book series so I was excited (and a little wary) when I heard Starz was going to film a TV series. Usually adaptations of books I love fall flat with me because they never seem to do the book justice or come close to what I imagined in my head as I was reading. So far these first 8 episodes exceed my expectations and I can't wait to see more!

I am however, less than pleased with Amazon. I had purchased Outlander as instant videos, as I had come across an app from Amazon that would allow me to watch on the new tablet I was planning on purchasing. The day I got my new Samsung tablet, one of the first things I did was go to download the Amazon Instant Video app, only to discover that in a matter of less than 24 hours- it was no longer available. I was directed to purchase the ""prime instant video"" which makes no sense to me. I'm not going to pay to see ""unlimited"" content that I don't want. I simply want to view what I've purchased without having to pay again. The only way I can now watch my Outlander (I don't have Starz) is to sit at my computer- the first go round was OK, but after a while that gets uncomfortable. Restricting how a customer can view content that they've purchased is grossly unfair in my opinion. I won't be buying any more downloads from Amazon and in all likelihood when the full season is released on DVD I will be buying it from Barnes & Noble- not only do members get a discount but free shipping too and more often than not it comes right the next day at no extra charge!!!!",1424390400,2,1555,4.098360655737705

6546022,5,B00M0GMC26,"I'll first say that I don't like how they split the season. Whether to make money or to do the first half as a test, either way, I don't want to have to wait so long to see Jamie and Claire back together again!

That said, you are reading this review because you already a fan of the books/show or you are wondering if you should be a fan of the books/show. To the former, I say hello fellow Outlander fan! To the latter: YES! Oh my, yes. Watch this series NOW, and read the books NOW.

Which should you do first? Well, that's a question. I am a traditionalist, and of the opinion that you get more pleasure from reading the book version of things before seeing the screen adaptation. When I heard that Outlander was becoming a show, I dug through my to-read pile and hauled out the series. I had been of a mind to read it, but never gotten around to it. The books first released when I was too young to appreciate them, so honestly I'm glad I waited. But man oh man! What a ride!

I managed to get through the first book of the series before the tv show started, but then I couldn't stop. I read right through My Own Heart's Blood and now I can't wait for the next one. These are 1000+ page books but they seem to go so quick. Because of the length, and the amount of detail, the tv show will never be able to capture it all. Which is why you really should read the books to get the most out of the viewing of the show. Reading DG's stories, I feel like I am living my lives with these characters. Watching them come to the life in the show is great, but really only the icing on top of a very rich cake.

The book, the show - both great and highly recommended! If you have done both, check out the soundtrack! Bear McCreary's music makes you feel like you are living in Claire & Jamie's world whenever you listen to it.",1424131200,3,1821,4.092436974789916

6546024,2,B00M0GMC26,"I've read all the books. At least twice. There was a story. Sets and costuming aside, it seems to have gotten lost in sensationalism in this production. By the end of season 1, I'm already tired of seeing Clare's ass and tits. And Jamie comes across as not much more than a sexually insatiable, smiling automaton without much intelligence. Season 1 includes scenes of events that never happened in the book. The level of violence is incredible--feels like The Passion of Christ meets Braveheart. It's amazing that the author would sanction a production that has so many deviations from the original story. It takes longer, but I would recommend the books over this ""tit""alating production.",1424044800,16,689,5.0

This is an Amazing show!!! I can hardly wait for April 4th. I didn't read the books, so I look forward to where the series will lead. Brilliant acting - for me nearly all are fresh faces save two. I love these characters - so well played I was pulled right in and held until I could go no further.

6546030,2,B00M0GMC26,"I would like to address one aspect of discussion which seems to concern some of the reviewers in this section before I get into the review of the program.  And that is the ""purchase"" of Season 1.  Some have expressed concern that they have purchased Season 1 and yet the second half of it will not come on air until later this year.  This has led some to believe that they will be charged again for a Season they have already purchased.

In fact, this may be the case.  It all depends on the studio and how they market the product.  If this so called ""second half"" comes on air and is still referred to as Season 1, then no further charges should follow.  However, if the studio (for what ever reason) decides to list the following episodes as Season 2, then they can charge another fee for the new season.
Take for example the show, ""The Black List"".  A favorite of mine and I watched all of Season 1 (some 20 episodes) and when Season 2 came available on Amazon, I had no hesitation in purchasing it.  Well about half way through (in November last year) it was suddenly announced that the ""finale"" would air and The Black List would not return until February this year.  Ok, so along came February and The Black List started up again. I was pleased to find that the episodes beginning in February were still referred to as Season 2 and I have been receiving each episode in my library at no additional charge.
So I guess it all comes down to how the program producers market their product.  If a person purchases a Season of a program, then they should
rightfully expect to receive all episodes of that season for the price paid.  Any additional seasons would attract additional costs.

OK, so now the program itself.  And let me be honest.  I have not read any books related to this program and if I had I would NOT try to compare this program to something I had read in a book.  Book reviews are book reviews.  Movie and TV show reviews are just that and the two have no place together in the one review.

I have watched every current episode of this season and while it, at first, piqued my interest, as it progressed, my interest began to wane, slowly at first and in the end very rapidly.  While I enjoy (as much as the next person) tales of ""wee things that go bump in the night"",  The settings were very good, the scenery great and most of the acting plausible.  I did not enjoy the on-going narrative by Claire.  It gave the program almost a ""documentary"" feel.  While the use of the common language (Gaelic) added some realism, the ""whispered"" explanations to Claire may have given her some understanding of what was going on, but to us viewers it left a lot to be desired as most of the ""whispers"" were just that and very difficult to make sense of.  While sub-titles have their own set of problems, if they add to the viewers understanding of the flow of the conversation, then they are much better than ""whispered explanations"".
SEX.  Yes, what would any ""love story"" be without a bit of sex tossed in?  But sometimes it can become a long drawn out boring addition to a tale and that is what happened with ""Outlander"".
As for our heroine Claire, she seemed to have a great deal of difficulty keeping her mind on her ultimate goal, i.e. getting back to her own time and her husband.  In the end, she came so close, but if that had happened, their would have been little value in continuing the tale.  All of which leads me to believe that it was the old producers trick to try and encourage viewers to come back to a ""New Season"", to find out what happens.
As for me, I won't be back.  As I said I began to lose interest early on and by the end all I could foresee was more of the same being served up over and over again.  Will Claire ever make it back to her husband (in 1945) or will she end up staying with her husband of earlier times.  I don't really much care and as for Claire, she seemed to enjoy both equally well so I guess it shouldn't matter.
To be sure, if this program attracts enough of an audience for advertisers to want to support it, it will continue on in it's endless and senseless repetition of sex and violence but ultimately the ratings will begin to fall and when that happens, it will not matter at what stage of development the story has reached, it will simply be dropped like a hot coal.",1423872000,18,4330,4.328376703841388

The lead actor and actress are both utterly beautiful, and give subtle, nuanced, heart-wrenching, star-making performances.  Can I also say verrry sexy performances-- they chemistry between them is off the charts-- they look as though they genuinely want to rip each other's clothes off.  For fans of romance, this is a sizzling romance novel come to life before your very eyes.  For fans of adventure, the story will keep you glued to the edge of your seat; it's a ripping good yarn!!

Well done to the producer for possibly the world's best ever casting -- never has there been such a perfect marriage of role & actor as with Jamie Fraser/Sam Heughan; I would have thought that role would be impossible to cast.  Every moment he is not on the screen, you want him to be there!  And then the producer did it again with Claire Randall/Caitriona Balfe; as witty and clever as she is beautiful.

""Volume 1"" (part 1 of season 1) was slow paced, which no one minded because of the fine world building and character development. This is what we wanted! To reacquaint ourselves with Gabaldons characters on screen was a treat, and the series itself features an amazing ensemble cast against the lush Scottish highlands. Anyone that's a fan of this series will surely love the starz series, and for new fans it hopefully puts the books in their hands. So Good.",1423699200,,641,4.631578947368421

It would be one thing if the total amount you paid was comparable to simply buying the FULL season of a show (as most studios still do it), that is to say: HALF AS MUCH for HALF THE SEASON!

I'm going to guess it's the same group of price-gouging thugs who decided that if ONE film can be hugely successful, splitting it into two or three movies must be correspondingly better for their bottom line, right?",1423612800,65,719,4.446969696969697

She's  also stunningly beautiful and has a presence that's perfect for the portrayal of our fearlessly strong Claire!  Sam Heughan is big muscley and very handsome!  His portrayal captures Jamie's leadership qualities, his humor and his gentleness.  From Jamie's nervous finger tapping to Claire's glass face book readers will be thrilled to see how closely this series follows the books.  Many if not most of the dialog comes straight out of the books. I RARELY like book adaptions but Ron Moore and crew have hit the ball out of the park with this one.

6546071,4,B00M0GMC26,"I've really liked the show overall so far, and several episodes have merited repeat viewings (pilot episode and ""The Wedding"").  The actors are doing a good job, and the scenery and costumes are just what I would expect and envision from having read the books a number of times.  There definitely are episodes (the pilot and the wedding for sure) that have a good bit of sex and nudity, but there's less of that overall--at least so far--than I might have expected from a channel like Starz.  And yes, some episodes are slowly paced.  But the show's producers are setting up this whole world and environment right now and deserve credit for wanting to do it right from the start.  Nothing worse than them blazing full speed ahead and realizing down the road that they're in a tight spot trying to explain/describe/set up something that they forgot to address early on.  And by not rushing too fast, maybe they'll avoid (or at least postpone for quite a while) the problem that Game of Throne will soon encounter--running out of the author's source material.

Not sure if I'll be buying this DVD/Blu-ray release in March, though.  The cost to get just half the season is what most shows cost for the entire season.  Having to pay that much twice--on top of paying for Starz to watch the show each week--is ridiculous.  I'm also not happy with how it appears they'll be handling the special features, based on what other reviewers are reporting.  If you're going to release DVDs/Blu-rays, then for goodness' sake, have both versions be the same.  This studio habit of only putting some (or even all) special features/digital copies on the Blu-ray version but not on the DVD version is very discriminatory to those who haven't/can't afford to upgrade their TVs and players, and pretty annoying in general.  Granted, I have now upgraded and can purchase Blu-rays, but I like having DVD versions of shows/movies accessible to me because I can play them while visit with relatives who haven't upgraded their entertainment technology.

So while I'd love to free up the space on my DVR, I'll be keeping my Outlander episodes for a while.  Maybe a retailer will surprise us all with a really low release-date price for this first half of the first season.  If not, I'll be waiting and hoping that the full-season disc price will be more reasonable.

Edited 2/19/15: It does appear that Amazon is lowering the price on this item.  From a $40 initial price, it's now listed at a sale price of $25.  Much better, but I still don't know if that's enough to induce me purchase next month.  I'd probably like it better if it was a ""purchase the whole season now, and we'll ship you the second half once it's released"" type of arrangement, rather than buying each half separately like I'm certain we'll be expected to do, especially since this box will come with a space to insert Volume 2 of this season later this year.  Too bad they can't be more sensible on how to arrange this (or that Starz couldn't just air the entire season in one continuous run).

Edited 3/16/15: Well, I did break down and buy the volume (though I got the basic blu-ray elsewhere rather than the collector's edition).  The featurettes are nice.  I'm not sure, but some of them may have been on the Starz website previously.  Haven't watched all the deleted scenes yet, but the ones I've seen are nice.  Huge issue for me is that trying to locate the deleted scenes was like going on an Easter Egg hunt where all the eggs are green.  Unlike *every* single other DVD/Blu-ray I've ever gotten, the deleted scenes for this release are *not* in the special features section where everyone would naturally think to look for them; neither are they edited back into the episodes the way the LOTR and Hobbit movies did it.  Rather, the deleted scenes are located with the episodes they come from and are only found when you go to the episode list and select a specific episode.  Then you can choose to watch the episode or watch the deleted scenes.  Very bizarre.  Don't know if this is typical of Starz releases or not.  Also unusual is the fact that all special features are listed in that section, regardless of which disc is in the player (if you select a featurette that's on the other disc, you're prompted to insert that disc to view).",1423180800,8,4295,4.655172413793103

6546080,4,B00M0GMC26,"This is a detailed review of the show.  I realize most buying this will already be fans of the books/show and have seen the episodes but for any newbies who saw this as a suggested purchase and want to know more, here's what I can tell you.  (I've watched the entire show so far and am reading the first book).

First off, ignore the part of the description that says ""epic travel through time."" This is not a time-travel or science fiction story.  It's about Claire Randall, a combat nurse in the 1940s who goes to Scotland after the second world war to reconnect with her husband (Frank)/have a second honeymoon.  Not realizing the place they're travelling to is a place for some pagan/druid activity, Claire accidentally time-travels through some standing stones after watching a druid ritual and ends up in 1700s Scotland.  From there it turns into an adventure/historical fiction story when Claire runs into and is kidnapped of sorts by some Scottish Highlanders who don't know what to make of an Englishwoman running around in that area.  She's taken back to their clan's Scottish castle and not knowing how to escape and go back to her own time or what to do next, has to cope with living in an era where there's a lot of Scottish clan politics (and clashing with the English soldiers who occupy the Scottish territories).  At the same time she has to be very careful to hide the secret of who she really is and where she really came from, not easy to do because Claire is very much an independent, stubborn, forthright person and harder still when she is ""hired"" to be the healer of the Mackenzie clan (the clan of the castle/property she's taken to).  It doesn't help that she attracts the attention of an English garrison commander - a brutal, sociopathic, sadistic English captain who is none other than her husband's ancestor.  And it really doesn't help that she might be developing smooshy feelings for one of the very, very handsome soldiers at Castle Leoch.  (Why can't I fall through standing stones and meet some gorgeous guys in kilts?  Surely Houston must have some standing stones somewhere?)

From showrunner/executive producer Ronald D. Moore (Battlestar Galactica), the show is beautifully executed and very faithfully adapted.  Much of it so far is right out of the book.  Of course this doesn't mean it's exactly to the letter how it'll be in the book because television doesn't work that way but it's very closely done (author Diana Gabaldon is a close consultant on the show and has a fun cameo in episode 4 ""The Gathering."")  Here's my opinion on the show for what it's worth: I actually like it better than the book.  I'm really enjoying the book but watching the show, I can tell the show makes some slight tweaks here and there (scenes added, certain lines in the book given to other characters, etc.) that make the storytelling smoother and an easier transition to tv.  It's like if the book is a pretty wooden carving, the show is the same carving, but sanded and oiled.  There are so many parts in the books where it just wouldn't work to have the show film them as is.  The show also softens some of the characters (including Jamie and Claire), so while it stays true to the essence of their characters, they're also made easier to like and relate to.

The actors, costumes, sets, music, etc., everything is breathtakingly realistic and very well produced; unlike so many American period shows, the characters look and act like real people.  The costumes (done by Moore's wife costume designer Terry Dresbach) actually look like period clothes and not like they were picked up from the 1700s Scotland Gap like they would in any other show.  It's a very expensive production so their attention to detail is amazing and really pulls you into the new world Claire is thrown into (with some occasional flashbacks to the 1940s lives of Claire and Frank).  One warning: the Highlanders' accents are sometimes hard to understand and the Gaelic (native Scottish language of that time period) is not subtitled, but if you pay close attention, it doesn't need to be and you can understand the context of what they're saying.

I've seen a lot of comparisons to Game of Thrones.  This is nothing like Game of Thrones which is high-concept fantasy.  I haven't read the rest of the books yet but from what I've heard, Outlander's books (and the show) are really more historical fiction and not fantasy.  Some people complain it's slow at times but it's never boring or unengaging.  The first few episodes have to have some quieter moments to set up all the characters, storylines and conflicts.  The only negative thing I have to say - not really negative so much as a warning - is it is extremely gritty and graphic.  This is made for the Starz network, the same network that had The White Queen, Spartacus and Black Sails.  If graphic sex scenes and very graphic blood and gore and draconian punishments are not for you, neither is this show.  It's not family friendly, absolutely not for kids or the squeamish and there are some rather disturbing scenes in just the first few episodes, so be mindful who you watch it with.  Much as I love the show, there are scenes of it I simply won't watch again - I'll either skip them or mute and leave the room.

Diana Gabaldon has told the story many times of the failures in making this into a project for the screen before and she agrees - and so do the books' fans - they really couldn't have seen a better job done with this than Ron Moore has done.  I highly recommend this (with the above caveats in mind) if you liked the books or like this kind of show in general.",1421798400,"1,303",5637,4.635814889336016

I too saw the initial description and it looked as fake as a three dollar bill. Starz has since updated the description and I also thank the person who updated her initial negative review.

I don't blame you one bit. While Starz is not responsible for what Amazon posts, it is responsible for contacting Amazon to make sure that the correct information is posted. If Starz hadn't tweeted that this was legitimate I would have continued to question it. So, I appreciate your alertness and your kindness towards other fans. Now, here's hoping Starz continues to have that description updated until it's actually correct. ;)",1421712000,8,722,4.918032786885246

Volume 2 to include the rest of Season 1, which starts in April, 2015.  I don't think the price is too bad, considering you are getting 8 episodes = 8 hours.

If necessary, get a Blu-ray player and the Blu-ray disks.  I'd never watched Blu-ray before so I was shocked how much more detailed the fabrics, costumes, colors, and other nuances appeared, compared to watching on regular TV or on my computer (non Blu-ray).  This was crisp & clear & popped right off my TV screen, compared to the muddier colors watching the traditional ""broadcast"" way.  Also, the scenes shot in lower light show up MUCH better via Blu-ray.  Okay, I think I've said Blu-ray enough - can you tell I'm a recent convert? Long live Outlander!!!!",1421712000,,701,4.760330578512397

6546104,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is an OFFICIAL release lassies, @Outlander_Starz the OFFICIAL Outlander twitter page just posted the link to this item. It's the REAL DEAL. It's not a scam, and about the ""Thai thing"", well, it means that it is dubbed and subbed in Thai, nothing more to it than that.

Obviously it's in it's original language, and I'm sure in English subbs too. Possibly and hopefully in Spanish too, but the listing just doesn't say that yet--I'm sure now that you've all pointed that out it'll be fixed. Dinna fash yerselves, just order the damn thing already. hahaha!

As for the show itself, the series is AMAZING, the books are the bomb, and you should buy this, NOW! Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser) and Caitriona Balfe (Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser) are amazing in it, as is the entire cast. Trrruly a great show and a fabulous story based on the books by Diana Gabaldon. I cannot wait to get this and bring Jamie (Sam Heughan) home with me.",1421712000,61,934,4.620481927710843

Ron Moore and the superb team of writers, producers as well as the entire cast and crew have done what most thought would not be possible.  By bringing much of the depth of Diana Galbadon's exquisite books to the screen, more people will be able to experience the pure magic of the series.  The absolute breathtaking beauty of Scotland is prominently featured.  The costumes, weaponry and locations seem so authentic offering proof that no one involved took the task of creating this show lightly.  Seeing it in HD now has just had me floored!  It is so crisp and the colors and sound...ah, there's just nothing better.",1421712000,,684,4.6115702479338845

6546108,5,B00M0GMC26,"This is clearly the first half of Season 1, as it is clearly labeled Volume 1.  Bar none, one of the very best productions I have ever seen on television.  I fully intend to own it and watch it often. Amazing story, beautifully written and performed.  Got my husband hooked on the book series and he has now read seven out of eight.  Don't miss this one.  The production values would support double the price, in my opinion.",1421712000,27,424,4.384615384615385

I have just seen that Diana Gabaldon says this is on official release. I love the books and the series, but the price will have to come down before I even put in a pre-order. $39 for 1/2 of the first season is too much for me.",1421712000,433,344,3.9285714285714284

8669387,5,B00M0GMC26,I had never heard of this series till two weeks ago. Now I have binged watched all 3 seasons twice! I love the story and the intense love/chemistry between Jaime and Claire. Its is the best show I have seen in a long time!,1533340800,,222,4.068181818181818
8669388,5,B00M0GMC26,"Good, but I feel uncomfortable watching this at times. I feel like it is a half step up from porn.

She falls for an idiot headstrong clansman after going back in time and away from her husband. I don't understand how she searched for Jamie(the clansman) and did not have empathy for the husband she left in 1940's, who is searching for her. I was disappointed when she married Jamie and more disappointed that she did not return home when she had the choice. She is selfish and stupid. What intelligent woman would choose a smelly/dirty ignorant Scottish clansman, who literally beats her for disobedience, over a respectful and intelligent man. LOL I watched the first season and some of the second. I just can't, Claire is a very weak minded woman, as she is literally ruled by her emotions. I realize the series would have been very short had she returned home, but it would have been much better.",1532995200,,916,4.767295597484277
