3938597,4,B002JP9HIK,"Edgar is Puccini's second opera, and as such is should be seen as part of the learning curve to one of the most famous and loved opera composers in the 20th century.
This four-act production is as close as we can expect to the premier of the opera in 1889. The premier was not a success and rightly so. If you expect the ""typical"" Puccini hit, don't buy this Disc, but if you are interested in following the development of a great artist, this is for you. In act 3 you can appreciate the young Puccini's gift for melodies that, in subsequent operas, will conquer the world.

The singers are first class and the staging is very effective and appropriate. The sound and the images in the Blue-Ray disc are as good as you can get from a staged production.",1261958400,6,752,4.371428571428571
3938598,5,B002JP9HIK,"This one starts off rough, but allow me to offer three words of advice:  Stick with it.

This performance begins fairly lackluster, with singing that is, quite frankly (and brutally) terrible, particularly from the two prima donnas, Amarilli Nizza and Julia Gertseva.  The men (Jose Cura as Edgar, Marco Vratogna as Frank and Carlo Cigni as Gualtiero) fair considerably better.

For whatever reasons (and keeping with the current ""update"" trend) Lorenzo Mariani moves the action up - SIX HUNDRED YEARS - so instead of a medieval tale of lust, blood and redemption, the whole thing looks very ""Sunday in the Park With George"" - in fact, the unit set is a lush, long grassed expanse like a meadow or unkempt park, steeply raked to appear hilly and fitted with enormous columns giving the feeling of a field near a courtyard.  It's lovely to look at and . . . eventually, makes a terrific setting.

If you think you know Edgar well, (as I did), you're wrong.  This is the original four act version that received only three performances - at La Scala in April 1889, was declared a failure, and put away never to be heard again, except in a variety of truncated three act versions.  The Fourth act is a revelation and consists primarily of a nearly half an hour of music for Edgar and Fidelia - an almost Wagnerian length duet, broken up with asides, choruses - pumping out an array of explosive emotions ranging from the tenderness and elation of love, to the crowds howling at the villainess as she's dragged off to the executioner's sword. It is thrilling.

The second act is slightly laughable - where I've always imagined a filthy 14th century orgy worthy of Hieronymus Bosch what we see is the same grassy park of act one but now with those circular Victorian-era sofas each wrapped around the columns of the first act. The woman are ghastly gotten up in bloomers and elaborate bustiers, their hair piled high a la ""Gibson Girl"" - and a sextette of them are donned up in Eartha Kit Catwoman masks and long red opera gloves.  The whole thing feels like The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas decided to mount The Merry Widow.  Julia Gertseva, gorgeous to look at vocally not at all impressive in Act I, here reveals a sizeable high mezzo, with amazingly free top notes, the voice sailing through Puccini's ""big girl"" music with no fears.  In black and red, with a kind of silly tiara, she creates a fascinating, deceptively shallow creature that is one part Lady Macbeth, two parts Thais.  (When Edgar abruptly stops making love to her when he hears the military trumpets, you can throw in one part of Carmen, too!).  The scenario is a tough one to fall for, but by this point you just have to go with it.

The glory of Edgar is its third act, Puccini's stunningly beautiful Requiem, and everything goes right here (even if it looks like a scene from Jane Eyre or Bleak House).  The chorus is terrific, the children's chorus touching and effective and most of all, Amarilli Nizza makes you forget her awkward first act by giving a performance that is soul searing.  Her ""Addio, mio dolce amor"" lets out all the stops, and the glory of her voice - a free and remarkably thrilling top - gives gooseflesh.  She dominates the ensemble that follows and her second aria over the shouts of Edgar and the villagers, as she defends the memory of the man all believe dead, before she and the others leave for home, is infinitely moving.

Tigrana's reappearance - to pay her respects, grieve and make her first attempt at prayer - is fouled by being set up and horribly taunted by Edgar and Frank, before she gives in to their offer to betray Edgar's memory.  Edgar's revelation provokes another response entirely from the reassembled crowd and the act ends in a moment that is as theatrically compelling and musically thrilling as anything else Puccini was to give us over the ensuing decades.  It is a phenomenal moment and a great curtain bringer downer.

The final act opens with Fidelia in her wedding veil, kneeling under and embracing the flowering almond tree she fell in love with Edgar.  She has been keeping vigil and the aria about her dream of marrying Edgar in heaven - which on paper sounds almost comically naive - is simply beautiful as handled b Ms. Nizza.  Carlo Cigni's Gualtiero's rich, beautiful bass baritone soars beautifully over the chorus in his prayer. Marco Vratogna doesn't get a lot to do as Frank, but his actorly presence is strongly felt throughout each act and when he sings, it's with an impressive voice.

Jose Cura has a major success as Edgar, this performance finding him mostly in glorious voice - the top notes exciting and every once in a while a gleaming hint of squillo creeps in that made me go ""oh yeah!.""  He croons a bit in some of the softer music, sounding like he's coming in for a rough spot at the end of one of his duets with Fidelia.  (To her credit Nizza, who sounded as though prepared to hold onto that note duet for eternity, cuts it off short like a true stage partner).

Yoram David leads an a sometimes clunky, but mostly spirited and beautiful performance from the Teatro Regio Torino forces.  There are moments that feel under-rehearsed or not thought too much about, for instance he doesn't really milk some of the Requiem music which cries at times for a more expansive reading while here it can be just a bit foursquare.  But, mostly he gets it right and the biggest moments ring out with a feverish passion that a work like this needs.

The accompanying pamphlet gives a nice article about the work.  Of immense interest is how Linda Fairtile had been trying to re-orchestrate the fourth act, believed to either have been destroyed or forever lost, from Ricordi's piano-only version, when she was approached by Puccini's granddaughter, who brought with her the entire full score which hadn't been seen in 121 years!

I've been a bit surprised a discovery of this magnitude wasn't more publicized, but this is a unique - and downright weird - opera, but don't let that put you off.  And don't give up after Act 1 - it's so very, very worth sticking with it!",1254960000,27,6111,4.632993512511585
8371527,1,B002JP9HIK,"I was looking forward to watching this.  I still am.  But the Blu-Ray is not Region-Worldwide, because the last I checked Northern Ohio is world wide, and disc will not play in my machine - nor in one in an electronics store.  Beware.  I'm going to try the DVD - if I can find it.",1523664000,,280,4.036363636363636
8371528,3,B002JP9HIK,"I just watched this restored 4-act version on YouTube, and I did not care for it -- some favorite arias were missing, and the ending seemed so. . . . tepid.  Maybe the revised, shorter version is a bit corny and melodramatic to some, but it's certainly punchier; the music has more verve.  This scenery was something between interesting and silly -- the early 1900's (or is it in Puccini-dated 1889?  Hard to tell by costumes) time frame set on a grassy hill has quite a compelling tone, but the goofy debauched party/brothel scene loses a lot of appeal, and I recognized so little of the music -- the duet between Tigrana and Edgar in that act is the best one in the opera, but this version didn't carry it.  I'd like to see other videos -- there's something else on You Tube which shows the more familiar/traditional version of Edgar, the one we are used to (those of us who own the LP of the 1977 concert performance conducted by Eve Queler, starring Renata Scotto, Carlo Bergonzi, and the incandescent Gwendolyn Killibrew as Tigrana.)",1478736000,,1038,4.594594594594595
8371529,4,B002JP9HIK,"Interesting since rarely done in this country. Soprano's performance doesn't rise to the level of the other main singers. However, Puccini's beautiful music is always a pleasure, and this is a nice addition to a collection.",1445385600,,223,5.222222222222222

8371532,5,B002JP9HIK,"Puccini's Edgar has often been ignored. After its premiere in 1889, it had only a few performances. Then was taken off. Puccini then fiddled with it and combined the third and fourth acts together. Now for the first time we have the fourth act as intended. This opera is set in the time of the unification of Italy movement. So we don't have knights walking around in armour, for Edgar was originally set in the 13th Century. Puccini had an affection for this opera and made several revisions of Edgar, the final one as later as 1905. Puccini himself called the libretto "" unbelievable trash"". This opera nearly was the finish of Puccini, but Giulio Ricordi the music publisher, had faith in him. He even agreed that if Puccini's next opera was a failure, he would bear the costs, and the shareholders would not lose money. He saw the pure emotion and one melody after another pouring out of the opera. I suppose he realized the libretto was the problem. So we have to thank Ricordi for the operas that followed, Manon Lescaut, La Boheme,Tosca, Madama Butterfly and so forth. The women always die at the end. He loved his heroines and hated parting with his operas. An illusion is often better then reality.

The story is straight forward. Fidelia is in love with Edgar. But Edgar is torn between love for her and his lust for the courtesan Tigrana, the only major part Puccini wrote for a Mezzo. The Villagers turn on Tigrana and Edgar protects her. Because of the villagers actions he decides to elope with her. He burns down his house( a bit illogical but in opera, you have to suspend disbelief.) Frank, Fidelias brother,fights Edgar and is wounded. Tigrana and Edgar escape. Act I over. Sounds like a bit of Mascagni's Cav. But Puccini wrote Edgar a year before that opera was Premiered. Tigrana is based upon Carmen, and Tigrana on Micaela. The chorus is inspired by Ponchielli and Verdi. In the other acts Wagner and Berlioz are another inspiration.

Act two. He tires of Tigrana. Red seats are set in a park like setting, with various prositutes laying Edgar. He joins the army. A good idea. Tigrana plots revenge, what else. A woman scorned and all those cliches. Act three, he is believed to be killed in battle. In the end, the coffin is found empty. Edgar has become a Monk in league with Frank,Fidelia's brother who is Captain in his regiment. He shows Tigrana who he is and curses her. I am not sure why Edgar had the need to pretend to be dead. Maybe he was frightened of Tigrana. Or simply wanted to be alone with blokes. Women would say, he is frightened of commitment. Act four. Fidelia wants to be buried with Edgar. Frank and Edgar reappears. Tigrana stabs Fidelia to death. The first of his heroines who die at the end. The libretto is rubbish. Puccini needs a medal in producing the music he did. Never again did he allow Librettists to dictate to him.

Jose Cura is in good voice. Fidelia is Amarilli Nizza, who sings all three parts in TDks bluray Ill Trittico, set in the 1920's conducted by Julian Reynolds. I can recommend this bluray. Tigrana is Julia Gertseva, who acts the part as to the manner born. The orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro Regio Torino is conducted with passion by Yoram David. The scenery is traditional I think. I throughly recommend this recording of this opera.",1311120000,,3312,4.610169491525424
8371533,4,B002JP9HIK,"Well, the lead in gives a pretty close overall description of what I think of this early Puccini opera - his second!.  I did follow it intently because beyond the influences of Verdi and Wagner which are preponderous, there is constant indication of the genius that was to come in his later operas.  However, in the full score of Edgar, Puccini has already created the full palette of orchestral colors that he would go on to sharpen and refine in later works.  For this reason alone, I would recommend this DVD to any true Puccini fan ...  it simply provides the basis of all that is yet to come.

The Blu-Ray DVD is actually striking in its color purity and impact.  The audio is slightly less so!

However as one reviewer has detailed above, the singing and orchestra leave a tad to be desired.  I would gladly have had other voices and a different conductor, but given the rarity of the work and its lack of truly glorious melodies found in later operas I am resolved to enjoy the production on its own terms.  There are moments of inspiration largely from Jose Cura as Edgar but these come after long periods of less impact.  The opera fails only because the composer lacked that brilliant honing of his skills and tightening of the libretto and score that would make it a sure fire hit.  Again, it is very much worth having in your collection with the consideration that this is truly early Puccini and not the master at his best.

My two cents!",1281225600,3,1451,4.4961832061068705
8371534,5,B002JP9HIK,"EDGAR has become my personal favorite Puccini opera other than TOSCA. No one could have done it better than Jose as he is AMAZING in the role. Every Opera fan should own this one. It does not get better. Let's hope this company keeps putting out operas on DVD. As a native Los Angelean our Los Angeles opera  has modernized and minimizing its productions ruining Wagner's Ring and others so we have no traditional venue for opera anymore in LA. In stead we need to visit opera houses around the world seeing traditional operas, so luckily we saw Jose in TORANDOT at the Royal Opera House. Jose is one of the greatest and this DVD is a great example. ENJOY -",1277251200,3,657,4.429752066115703
8371535,4,B002JP9HIK,"I've learned not to expect of the current singers the performance of the singers from decades past. Lack passion!  Taking this in consideration,
 this is a wonderful recording, well sung and very suitable production.",1271203200,4,216,5.323529411764706
8371536,5,B002JP9HIK,"Before going any further, I would suggest you read the extensive and thorough review by G.P.  Padillo for the DVD release of this performance.  He has gone into great detail and provides an excellent outline of the opera and its history.  I am writing this review, due to some differences in perception of the work and its performance.

It has been stated, in other sources, that Puccini lacked the ability to handle the drama of a story such as Edgar.  In fact, the fault lies with the libretto by Ferdinando Fontana, as the story of Edgar bears weaknesses and some degree of illogicality in its structure. In the total perspective of the complete four act work that has now been returned to us, Puccini has provided an opera with a relatively good dramatic arc, and an opera that contains a good complement of attractive arias, an especially beautiful duet, and a large quota of excellent and appealing chorus work.

As other reviews have stated, the performance does not commence well.  I would not say it takes the entire first act for everyone to get into their stride, but it takes a good 20 minutes at the least, and this includes the strings, which is a body that could be better coordinated in these early stages. But it all settles down into quite excellent performances from all soloists (I suspect it was recorded at one performance, rather than the usual two or three, allowing editing together the best sections). In this fairly lengthy work, it is well worthwhile putting up with the shaky start for all that follows.

The work starts slowly, sounding to me initially as if it could be more in the vein of ""Rondine"" , but Puccini manages his flawed libretto and progressively builds the dramatic intensity and flow of the opera, reaching a powerful and moving conclusion to what proves to be a quite dramatic work.  After the shaky beginnings, all of the artists, as mentiond, perform well, with Jos Cura outstanding in his lead role as Edgar.  Special mention should also go to the chorus.  This work is laden with quite a lot of chorus singing, and the chorus members are very well up to the demands of the work -- something important for this opera if it is going to ""come off"".

Whilst I might look forward to a production with slightly higher standards in most departments, all aspects here are sufficiently good to give a competent presentation of a work that we have been denied for far too long.

On the technical side, both lighting, photography and editing seemed to speak more of a film background rather than recording stage productions, but while giving a different look, this aspect did not spoil the production in any way for me. There are a few Blu--ray releases that have a marginally sharper image, but this is still in the very good class.  Sound, which is also of a high standard, is available in PCM stereo, as well as DTS--HD Master Audio 7.1.  Image is 16:9.

So, as I said, while we may wish for a production at a slightly higher standard, after much reflection, I gave five stars as the production shows a well-unified concept, providing a worthwhile performance of an opera none of us has ever seen, yet should never have been lost.  Despite the faults, when the performance came to an end, my immediate reaction was that I wanted to watch it all over again straight away.  If you love Puccini, then buy this, forgive it its weaknesses, considering its entirety rather than picking at odd places.  I think if viewed and listened to in this way, that is, as the complete work, rather than the sum of its parts, you will be very pleased to have it added to your collection.",1265673600,7,3612,4.633228840125392
