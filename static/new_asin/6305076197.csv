7882004,5,6305076197,"The gap between Seasons VI and VII are due to the following:  Red Dwarf co-creators Doug Naylor and Rob Grant severed their partnership, leaving the former to form other writing teams.  Craig Charles (Lister) was falsely accused of [assault] in 1994 and sentenced to three months on remand.  Log entry ends--review proper begins.
""Tikka To Ride"":  With Starbug's curry supplies wiped out, Lister manipulates Kryten by fitting him with a spare head, overriding said head's guilt chip and behaviour protocols, and leads the others on a curry hunt in the 22nd century using the time drive they got from ""Out Of Time.""  They instead land on 22 November 1963, inside the Texas Depository Building, where by sheer accident, they turn a certain Lee Harvey Oswald into a giant pizza.  Unfortunately, this means they have altered the timelines and land on an Earth where the Soviets beat the U.S. in the space race and hence Starbug no longer exists.  Memorable dialogue:  ""As a mark of respect on Sunday [on the loss of curry], I thought at 12 o'clock we could have a moment's flatulence.""  And a promotion to first officer of Starbug for whoever can understand this temporal paradox:  ""...there was no time drive for them to have in the future to bring back into the present to destroy in the future the past selves in the present.  Put simply, by killing us, they killed themselves because once we were dead, it was impossible for us to become them in the future and return in time to kill ourselves in the past, even though it was the present.""  Michael J. Shannon (Kennedy) really has JFK's Bostonian accent down pat.
Stoke Me A Clipper:  Originally titled ""Natural Born Rimmers"", the Starbug crew run into Ace Rimmer once again, to the chagrin of Arnold Rimmer, who thinks that the remaining 3000 vomit bags won't be enough for him.  However, surprise of surprises, the original Ace has ""caught the business end of a neutron cannon"".  This Ace is the most recent hard-light holograms to succeed Ace, to take over from the previous one.  Ace feels that deep insdie, Arnold wants to be a hero, and wants him to take over.  Lister has his doubts, even saying, to Ace's ""you can't judge a book by its cover"", ""you can't confuse Rimmer with a book.  For starters, books have got spines.""  There are two nice-looking blondes here, Alison Senior (Princess Bonjella) and Sarah Alexander (the medieval Queen).
Ouroboros:  After we see a baby Lister being found under a pool table of the Aigburth Arms, we flash forward 3 millions later, where the crew discover a hyperway leading to a parallel dimensional in the storage hold.  Three familiar figures appear from the other side:  the Cat, Kryten, and Lister, a hard-light hologram, followed by a very flesh-and-blood Christine Kochanski.  In the other reality, it was Kochanski who got frozen for 3 million years for saving Frankenstein the cat and Lister who died and was revived as a hologram.  A standout scene is the heart-to-heart conversation between Lister and Kryten, where Kryten acts like a jealous lover and speaks in a high-pitched voice. Another is the tender conversation between Lister and Kochanski, talking about the child they will have in an in vitro tube.  Lister thinks he spent most of his life drifting because he didn't know who he was and where he came from, and he doesn't want his child to undergo the same experience.
Season VII marks the drama-comedy phase of the programme, where personal aspects of certain characters are explored, and characters have serious heart-to-heart conversations with each other.  And the special effects and spaceship models are superlative for this season.  Chloe Annett makes a welcome addition as Kochanski, and yeah, she does lack that cute Scottish brogue of C. P. Grogan, but a Kochanski resembling 80's MTV VJ Martha Quinn merged with Posh Spice will do.",1059868800,,3857,4.875766871165644
7882005,1,6305076197,"I think a certain prolific reviewer may well be out of his mind. Better than series 5? I've followed every series as & when they have aired on the good old BBC and series 7 is without doubt the worst of the crop.  Stevie Wonder could see that the introduction of Kochanski as a central  character was destined not to work & was the mark of a show wondering  where else to go. It seems every negative review gets marked down as  unhelpful but trust me, I'm not saying this for the sake of it or to be  misleading as I'm a truly massive Red Dwarf fan, but this video simply  isn't worth the bother.",958435200,,596,4.139130434782609
7882006,4,6305076197,"Series 7 of Red Dwarf is considered the worst of the lot (and Series 8 isn't all that great either) but these three episodes are quite good, if not on a par with the best of Series 6.  'Tikka To Ride' wraps up the last  episode of Series 6 and shows the consequences of Lister's lust for curry  and the change in American history which results.  The final scene where  Lister gets his comeuppance and gets the vindaloo (substituting 'vindaloo'  for a four letter word beginning with either 's'or 'c') stomped out of him  is classic Red Dwarf-I guess they got tired of picking on Rimmer all the  time and for once Lister gets what Rimmer has always suffered through- a  good whipping.  We get to see Ace Rimmer for the last time in 'Stoke Me A  Clipper' and Lister gets to find out about his past in 'Ouroboros,' a  slightly cathartic episode.
Unfortunately, 'Ouroboros' introduces  Kochanski, who is depicted as snooty, smarmy, stuck-up and in general not  likeable (although she is a good navigator and Lister has the hots for  her-but will Lister give up his gross habits and curry in order to get  lucky with her?).  In other words, a female Arnold Rimmer. At least, Rimmer  had a few redeeming qualities (everybody needs a scapegoat and Rimmer was  the perfect one)and the interaction between the crew was what made RD so  special.  Kochanski doesn't fit in and maybe Kryten was right when he tries  to get rid of her. Cottage cheese with pineapple chunks?  I would rather  drink chilled vindaloo sauce and sprinkle onions on my cornflakes!",947635200,2,1544,4.654275092936803
7882007,3,6305076197,"Gmph. Well, here we go. Whilst the three episodes on this type are of reasonable quality... the episode 'Ourroborros' (or something) being paticulary good in its expanding of a previous throwaway joke to a curiously pathotic conclusion and the Ace Rimmer one also getting in a fair  share of laughs along with also, a curiously pathotic conclusion... the  scriptwriting fails to meet the high standards of the previous six series.  What's worse is that it is down hill from here. The new Kochanski is  stupendously irritating with two expressions, one bland and expressing  anger, the other bland and, um, expressing annoyance. Claire Grogan made a  far better, quirkier and downright sexier Kochanski. Kryten gets idiotic  material in a vain attempt to lift him back above the 'exposistion droid'  he was in previous series.  The characters do incredibly stupid things with  little reasoning and... gagh... and... yet...
The acting barring Chloe  Annett is still of a pretty high class. There is still the genuine  camaraderie and there are a few fun plot twists and the script delivers...  (""Hurrah!"" - Dwarfers)
Up to a point.  (""Kill him""  -Dwarfers)
The inherent problem is that whilst the first 6 series were  co-written one of the writers left for this one. I imagine that the jokes  came about in the previous series with the banter between the two down at  the pub, as well as putting each others ideas through pretty tough  editting. This led to a tight, efficient incredibly funny series. Sadly no  longer. The genuinely funny jokes are now very sparse and many revolve  around pitiful jokes about curry, personal hygine and the space corp  directive cliche. Even worse we appear to have either canned laughter or  audiences threatened with violent dutch-rubs unless they laugh at every  second line. Frankly I'd stick with the previous six very funny series,  save your money for 'Back To Reality', 'Backwards' and 'The End' and put  your fingers in your ears and hum real loud if anyone tries to show you  series 8 or the second half of this series, where it makes a bold leap from  below par to excrutiatingly unfunny.
Chloe Annett. Doh!
P.S: I AM a  HUGE FAN of the previous Six. Buy them. And Blackadder.",943315200,,2220,4.89247311827957
7882008,4,6305076197,"This is a pleasant surprise, after the near-utter disaster that the previous two series were.  Yes, it's not a good thing that Rimmer's gone for most of it, but here we *finally* start to get back into the more  character-based episodes that characterized the first few series.  It gets  a bit weak towards the end (who decided to let Robert Llewelyn write an  episode, anyway?), but as a whole this is quite good, with some truly great  episodes (Duct Soup, even without Rimmer, stands out).  I was  none-too-excited about Kochanski appearing as a regular (and a different  actress, to boot), but it worked out better than I had imagined it would.  Very nice.",916790400,,660,4.761061946902655
7882009,5,6305076197,"Though each season has its great episodes (Queeg, Polymorph, Quarantine), Season Seven is the only season where ALL of the episodes are great.  Although Rimmer leaves the show after the second episode (and appears a  little later in the episode ""Blue""), the addition of Kochanski is  a great one.
All good Smegheads should get Season Seven, hands down the  best of the Red Dwarf series.  Looking forward to Season Eight!",912297600,,420,4.942857142857143
