3493717,3,B001BL96JI,"George Clooney must like making vintage movies because when left to his own devices, that's what he does.  Besides the noir must be back.  `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Married-Life/dp/B0013FZUP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Married Life</a>,' `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Dahlia-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000K2UVZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Dahlia (Full Screen Edition)</a>,' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-German/dp/B000OY8NBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good German</a>' all point in that direction.

Put all the components of `Leatherheads' together:  a screwball comedy, old fashioned brawls, and a sassy female reporter looking for the best scoop, and you're in for a good, old-fashioned time.

For this outing George Clooney plays Dodge Connelly, an aging football player, barely financing The Bulldogs, his Duluth, MN team.  When his business goes belly up, he and his fellow players go back to manual labor.  Until one day while listening to the radio, he hears a broadcast of a Princeton game that draws a crowd of 40,000.  Persuasively, he talks ""The Warrior Hero,"" Carter ""Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krazinski) and his agent C.C. Frazier (Jonathan Pryce) into a lucrative offer to join his team and take a college leave of absence.  At the same time, savvy newspaper reporter, Lexie Littleton (Rene Zellweger is assigned to investigate Carter on a rumor that his legendary story in ""The Great War"" is a hoax.

Clooney directed this film, and his skills to transport us to another era are spot on.  Speakeasy bars, vintage press scenes, and old-fashioned meeting rooms are done well without lingering over every detail.  Some of the movie's best lines are given the Spencer Tracy-Katherine Hepburn treatment between Clooney and Zellwiger (or make that Cary Grant and Mae West).  Maybe the final football game scenes won't be the most exciting in cinema history, but some of the wittiest dialogue of the year have come from this film, giving the comedy genre a much needed boost.  If  that's not reason enough to see this movie, then nothing else is.

3493718,3,B001BL96JI,"This is a pleasant enough diversion for an hour and a half, and then you will forget it rather quickly. The cast is charming, but the story is not very compelling. The soundtrack is probably worth listening to, though.",1222214400,,218,4.615384615384615
3493719,2,B001BL96JI,"""Leatherheads,"" the new comedy directed by George Clooney, takes place in the mid-1920's. College football draws big crowds while fledgling pro football has no rules, is played in cow pastures by a ragtag collection of ruffians, and has trouble attracting enough spectators to meet expenses. Dodge Connelly (George Clooney), a player for a pro team, the Duluth Bulldogs, is facing unemployment as his team is about to go belly up. He has an idea.

Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski), regarded as a war hero for single-handedly forcing the surrender of over thirty German soldiers, is a Princeton football star. Why not lure him to pro football with the promise of a huge per-game fee, thereby boosting attendance and drawing attention to pro football? Meanwhile, fast-talking cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) is assigned to dig into Carter's war hero story to see if there is something fishy about it. This lays the groundwork for a romantic triangle with both Dodge and Carter vying for Lexie's affection.

""Leatherheads"" is designed as an homage to 1930's screwball comedy, when stars like Carole Lombard, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and William Powell found themselves in precarious situations and attempted to deal with them with witty banter and slapstick in the face of mistaken intentions, unexpected romantic entanglements, and rich relatives. Though ""Leatherheads"" veers a bit from the formula, it self-consciously tries to mimic the feel of those Frank Capra, Preston Sturges, and George Cukor romps of yore.

The film seems an odd choice for Clooney to give double duty as star and director. It never achieves the polished brilliance of classic screwball comedy, often feeling like a film school exercise in duplicating the style. Writers Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly incorporate some very funny moments but fail to maintain the breakneck pace of true screwball comedy.

The three leads are all charming, with Ms. Zellweger a standout as wisecracking Lexie, the girl reporter looked down on by her all-male colleagues. We're reminded of Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday,"" but Zellweger gives Lexie her own spin. She loves to be feminine but wants her journalism to be taken seriously. She yearns for the Big Story. She's been promised a longed-for promotion if she succeeds in finding some dirt on Carter. In true screwball comedy fashion, her professionalism comes in conflict with her heart when she finds herself falling for Carter. With her kewpie doll looks, Zellweger is a perfect fit for Lexie.

Mr. Krasinski (TV's ""The Office"") is very good as blueblood Carter Rutherford. He brings an easygoing naturalness to his portrayal of the football and war hero and handles the romantic scenes effectively as well. In the old days, this character might have been written simply as a good-looking naif. But this Carter is no mere pretty-boy, and there are some interesting twists along the way. His heroic icon image is balanced by the reality of a self-serving, greedy opportunist. Since the movie is a comedy, all things -- or almost all things -- turn out well.

Rated PG-13, ""Leatherheads"" is certainly entertaining. Its production design, costumes, period automobiles, vintage billboard advertisements, and peppy score by Randy Newman nicely suggest the period. Beneath the comedy is the story of how pro football transformed itself from the poor cousin of college football into what would eventually become America's most popular spectator sport.",1221955200,,3487,5.2513464991023335
3493720,1,B001BL96JI,It's lousy. Don't waste your time.  It does not work on many levels. There are a couple of scenes that can be considered funny. But the film as a whole is flat.,1221868800,3,160,4.0
3493721,5,B001BL96JI,"Professional football in the 1920s was played with minimal padding, full on contact and ""the rules were simple, there weren't any.""  You could probably say the same thing about the fans...there weren't any.  Dodge Connelly (George Clooney) is fully aware of this need to attract fans or else the league goes bankrupt.  Desperate to keep the game he loves going, Dodge devises a plan to bring the most popular player at the collegiate level to play at the professional level.  Hence, Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinksi), the war hero who returned to college to get his degree, to save football.

The two football stars battle about as much off the field as they do on, engaged in a love triangle to compete for the affection of a snappy journalist, Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger), whom is sent to cover Carter's story.  Dry, offbeat humor similar to the laughs seen in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", although the laughs are more prevalent in ""Leatherheads,"" combined with witty dialogue and suave and charming acting, make this film succeed as both a football spoof and romantic comedy.

A football spoof ""Leatherheads"" may be, but it does have a small bit of accuracy to it.  The National Football League was in fact very unpopular in its early years and was in need of a major attraction.  It was in fact a collegiate athlete who made the jump into the professional league in hopes of saving it.  His name was Harold ""Red"" Grange and he drew in crowds somewhere in the tens of thousands when he played.  The recognition of his name helped the league grow to new heights much like the name of Carter Rutherford did for the league in ""Leatherheads.""

When the regular season is all said and done, ""Leatherheads"" finishes atop its division with aspirations of winning the Super Bowl.  Join the bandwagon.",1221264000,3,1816,4.80064308681672
3493722,2,B001BL96JI,"As a comedy, this movie isn't very funny.  As a depiction of early pro-football it isn't accurate.  As a sports movie, it has all the stale conventions of the genre.  Hollywood just can't make a good sports movie--with the exception of ""Raging Bull.""

We know who's going to win the big game finale.  It never fails.  And in 1925 there's a radio announcer to tell us what's happening, in case we are all sight impaired.  The thing is, there were no sports broadcasts in 1925.  There's a fight, with haymakers galore, and no one has a mark on him.  Perish the thought that the stars would have a fat lip.  The mud in the final game never besmudges the stars except for their uniforms.

The acting just--well--isn't.  Zellweger looks nice, as usual, but her acting talents are wasted here.  Clooney will please the women who like to look at him, but that's scarcely a talent.

This is, in the final analysis, a piece of fluff to be blown off as quickly as possible.",1221004800,,963,4.491329479768786
3493723,4,B001BL96JI,"Set in the mid-1920s, LEATHERHEADS is a movie about the development of football from just being an amateur game played most prominently as a college sport to becoming a professional sport that would one-day rival baseball as America's pastime. The film stars George Clooney as Dodge Connelly, a dedicated football player who wants to bring the game to the next level. Dodge is a man who has both skill as a player and smarts as well. In order to turn the game he loves into a professional sport, he needs a gimmick that will catch the attention of the media and the hearts of the people. Dodge has already attempted to manipulate things by ghost-writing his own sports reviews. However, he needs something bigger. Enter Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski), a war hero who returned to the states to finish his degree and became a college football star in the process. Knowing the attention that follows Carter's every move, Dodge offers Carter an offer he can't refuse that, overnight, turns professional football from being a hack sport played in cow fields into a serious sport of a higher (and more lucrative) caliber. Hot on the trail of Carter is ace reporter, Lexi Littleton (Rene Zellwegger), a blonde bombshell with brains sent undercover to figure out the secret that Carter seems to be hiding behind his sheepish grin. As the plot unfolds, a love triangle also develops between Carter, Lexi, and Dodge and the characters have to figure out if the truth should stand alone or if it's better to speak the truth in love.

With that said, don't get the wrong impression. LEATHERHEADS is not a serious movie. It is a comedy. Actually, it's a screwball comedy, the type of comedy that Hollywood hardly makes anymore. The film was marketed as a pseudo-sports film, but it's really not a sports movie. The sports played are just the background noise for the script's witty banter, the designers' authentic costumes and sets, and the actors' delightful performances. The film also has a great score written by Randy Newman that also captures the essence of the era. Watching the film, I was reminded of some of the great witty screwball comedies of the past that I have watched, most notably HIS GIRL FRIDAY.

I really enjoyed watching LEATHERHEADS. It didn't do as well at the box office as it was hoped to do, but I have a feeling that it is a movie that will find a large amount of success now that it is available on DVD. As of September 2008, it is still on my list of top 10 films of the year. Recommended for fans of Clooney, Zellwegger, Krasinski, and for anyone who enjoys old-fashioned, witty screwball comedies.",1220745600,,2634,4.7363834422657956
3493724,4,B001BL96JI,"I really enjoyed this movie, partly because I think George and Rene are great actors. The chemistry between them in this movie is classic. I love the witty, fast paced, sarcastic dialogue between the two of them. If you like movies like ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" or the kind of fast paced humor in the Ocean's movies, then I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this. And it was fun to see Jim from ""The Office"" play a bit different role.",1220659200,2,431,4.4
3493725,3,B001BL96JI,"There are two types of offensive philosophies in football: running and passing.  Passing teams are full of action and danger, exciting in success and failure.  Running teams, however don't really provide eye-catching performances; instead, they hope to grind down an opponent and be close enough to win the game with a late field goal.  ""Leatherheads"", much like teams at the genesis of football, is a pure running attack.

In the mid 1920s football was only played on the college fields.  With leather helmets and a dearth of rules, there was no future in professional football.  Some men like Dodge Connelly (Clooney) wanted to change that.  To do so, Dodge needed a niche.  His first attempt was writing his own game reviews for the local paper.  Soon, however, he'd have his golden goose.  Lexi Littleton (Zellwegger) was a career-minded, sour-faced reporter who gets assigned to report on a war hero and college football star named Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford.  When the worlds of Carter, Lexi, and Dodge converge, the opportunity for Dodge's epiphany was born.

From there it's a faux sports movie, a masquerade of masculinity, a love triangle in disguise, with semi-interesting drama interspersed with just enough football action to feel nostalgic empathy for the bumps and bruises brought on by bone crunching hits.

Superbly acted by all but Zellwegger - who was awkwardly bad as an ambitious, female sports reporter - and filmed beautifully, it's easy to get a feel for the era.  Authenticity being key, the costume and set designers come off as the true stars of this movie.  Otherwise, it's not remotely close to the blockbuster for which Clooney had hoped.  The main problem I have is that it's another movie billed and promoted in the comedic sports genre.  However, it's nowhere near an actual sports movie.  If Leatherheads is a sports movie, then Blair Witch Project is a horror movie and Kids is a comedy.

I got the feeling that this movie was a little light on the script, and the folks in charge of production thought that the love for Clooney's charisma and Zellwegger's pout would be enough to win over the audience.  Leatherheads disappoints because the attempt at romantic comedy being fused with pseudo-sports documentary fails to provide anything extremely interesting in either area, a broken play in which a lack of team cohesion restricts forward progress.  Most people watching will desperately need a halftime performance to fight to the end, but like a Hail Mary, there's almost a near guarantee of failure.",1220054400,6,2543,5.021479713603819
3493726,1,B001BL96JI,"""Put together a beatiful girl, a handsome guy, a popular sport, the roaring twenties, some witty comments and people will come to see it, there is no need to worry about anything else."" This seems to be what writer, director and producer thought when launching this movie. One even has the impression they did not even have a clue of what they were doing. Is it a comedy, a sports movie, a satire about sports and journalism... ? It could have been many things, had somebody taken care of it, but left completely to itself, the movie is... nothing. There are some strokes of a story that could have been funny, some situations and ironies that could have provided the basis for a good satire, historical hints about the development of one of the most popular sports in America, but everything hangs loose and disconnected. Fortunately, I did not have to pay a cent to see it. I saw it during a long flight back from Asia. The positive side of it is that it helped me to get asleep.",1219449600,3,981,4.455555555555556

This is how the story goes: In 1925, Dodge Connolly is a charming, brash football hero who is determined to guide his team from bar brawls to packed stadiums. But after the players lose their sponsor and the entire league faces certain collapse, Dodge convinces a college football star to join his ragtag ranks. The captain hopes his latest move will help the struggling sport finally capture the country's attention. Welcome to the team Carter Rutherford, America's favorite son. A golden-boy war hero who single-handedly forced multiple German soldiers to surrender in WWI, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed on the field. This new champ is almost too good to be true, and Lexie Littleton aims to prove that's the case. A cub journalist playing in the big leagues, Lexie is a spitfire newswoman who suspects there are holes in Carter's war story. But while she digs, the two teammates start to become serious off-field rivals for her fickle affections. As the new game of pro-football becomes less like the freewheeling sport he knew and loved, Dodge must both fight to keep his guys together and to get the girl of his dreams. Finding that love and football have a surprisingly similar playbook, however, he has one maneuver he will save just for the fourth quarter. The cast led by George Clooney (as Jimmy 'Dodge' Connelly), Renee Zellweger (as Lexie Littleton), and John Krasinski (as Carther Rutherford) is excellent! The directing by Clooney (who also directed the upcoming ""Suburbicon"" (2009), he also directed ""Good Night, And Good Luck."" (2005), also wrote the screenplay as well, & ""Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind"" (2002) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Duncan Brantley & Rick Reilly is excellent!

Pro franchises mostly belonged to small towns.  These days, Green Bay is one of the few original ""small market"" franchises that still has a team.

This was an era in which nobody was even sure of the rules - including the Refs.  For the most part, this epoch of football is long forgotten, which is what makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leatherheads-Widescreen/dp/B001BL96JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leatherheads (Widescreen)</a>&nbsp;such a worthwhile film.

The story centers around a pro team based in Duluth, MN.  On the verge of bankruptcy, the team lands a hot-shot war hero  /  college player from Princeton university.  Immediately, the team's stock goes through the roof & the team begins to play in front of sellout crowds.

The one dubious aspect of the plot would be the lad's service in WWI.  The Great War (as it was so called) ended in 1918, and the movie picks-up in 1925 as the player is playing his last game for Princeton.  The movie doesn't account for the 7yr gap in the chronology where a 4yr gap would be expected.  Then again, I might be missing something & I don't mean to nit-pick.

All in all, this is a very fun movie.  George Clooney is great as the aging athlete and Renee Zelwegger is as adorable as ever.  Having season tix to MSU games, I have an anthology of Michigan State football.

3493804,3,B001BL96JI,"Leatherheads is a comedy about the early days of professional football.  In the 1920s, college football was overwhelmingly more popular than professional.  Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a professional player who hopes to change this.  After his Duluth Bulldogs are disbanded due to lack of funds, Connelly comes up with a scheme to save the sport.  He lures Carter Rutherford (Krasinski) away from Princeton to play for the Bulldogs.  Rutherford is the highly popular college player who is hailed as a hero from World War I.  Things get off to a smashing start as the first team practice with Rutherford is moved to a nearby college facility in anticipation of the crowd.  More people (thousands) come to watch practice than were ever at a game (10-20).  It all seems to work according to plan with the exception of Lexi Littleton (Zellweger) who comes to probe the details of Rutherford's service records in World War I.  The remainder of the story focuses on how this conflict plays out.

There are plenty of good laughs in Leatherheads.  Clooney and Zellweger have most of the zippy exchanges.  Their first meeting is a ""one upping"" contest between the two.  There is also physical humor such as the ridiculous fist fight that Clooney and Krasinski execute in the middle section of the movie.  Clooney also works with some familiar actors from his experience on O' Brother Where Art Thou?.  You may recognize the Bulldogs' Coach Ferguson (Wayne Duvall) as having played Homer Stokes while drunken reporter ""Suds"" (Stephen Root) was Mr. Lund, the blind radio station manager.  Both are well cast and provide their own comic elements.

The story is interesting and entertaining.  The special features reveal much of the historic background of the story as well as the visual techniques.  There were no locations true to the 1920s football stadiums so they built facades and used CGI to create the crowds.  There is also a prank that Clooney played on the cast after filming was complete.  He made them go through the act of getting all muddy and prepped for shooting in front of a green screen only to call for a rap and inform them that they don't really need this scene.  The reaction of the other actors shows what a good rapport Clooney established with them.  Everyone had a good laugh, and Clooney's dress clothes wind up nice and muddy.

So, Leatherheads is an enjoyable movie if you like football and comedy.  However, I have to ask myself the question ""Is this something that I would want to watch again in the future?""  Unfortunately the answer to this is probably not.  While it is worth the investment of time for a single viewing, it lacks anything truly compelling to make you come back again and again.

3493806,3,B001BL96JI,"Most of the movie is snappy comedy and old-time romance.  The football scenes toward the end drag but overall a fun movie to watch and enjoy.

The early 1920's is when Leatherheads takes place.  Leatherheads title comes from the helmets they wore at the time - hardly protecting the player's heads, but much about football has changed since then.  Professional football was laughable.  It showed the early team playing in a farm field with a cow chewing grass and looking mildly irritated her field was full of crazy men running back and forth.  Few fans were around.

Dodge Connelly (George Clooney) is an older player (45 years old) and does not want his team, the Duluth Bulldogs, to fold - like other teams are across the United States.  College football is doing better than the weak professional teams.  Dodge latches onto a top player Carter Ruthford (John Kasinski) who is also a national hero of the First World War.  Carter is young, smart and is talked into playing for the Bulldogs for $5,000 of the gate receipts.  He brings in the fans, the reporters and money.  The Bulldogs are on a gravy train with him - he helps pack in the fans and get bigger professional stadium.

Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) is the cute Chicago Newspaper reporter (also the romantic interest of Dodge and Carter) who wants a ""big"" story to make her editor of a newspaper.  She is ambitious, full of moxie and knows how to handle herself in a man's world of sports.  The drama starts when Carter falls for her and confesses that his heroics in capturing a group of German Soldiers was sheer luck (although I thought he should still get credit).  She has some guilt but prints the story and then the movie gets complicated and a little off kilter.  The story line gets a bit goofy and off the point.

However the movie meanders, it was fun and enjoyable - Dodge and Lexie are played in the spirit of the 1930's romantic comedies and many laughs throughout.",1252022400,10,1949,4.63265306122449
3493807,3,B001BL96JI,"George Clooney tackles the comparisons that have been made between him and Cary Grant head on in this period comedy, by not just directing but starring in exactly the sort of screwball comedy that made Grant a star.  It's debatable whether he should have tried, as the end result does not quite fire on all cylinders - but it's still worth a watch.
It's clear from the first moment of the movie when we see a sepia toned vintage Universal logo instead of the usual spinning planet, that Clooney is going all out to homage the movies that they used to make in `the good old days'.  What becomes apparent as the movie goes on, is that he is also making a movie about the origins of professional football, as it goes from poor boy of college football to rich money-driven sport.  As director, he succeeds admirably in the vintage setting, and the picture looks lush and beautifully shot, even as the players splash in the mud.  As actor, he scrapes through on his undeniable charm, but there is a nagging feeling that he is trying just a little hard to create those Cary-Grant-esque moments at times with his gurning and double takes.  He is hardly helped by Renee Zellwegger, whose idea of appearing in a period movie is to purse her lips as much as possible, and gradually relax them to indicate her character mellowing...  Sorry to say, she does not on this outing match any of the great stars like Katherine Hepburn, Carole Lombard or Jean Harlow who defined the genre, but her fans will not be too disappointed.
The professional football aspect of the film fares much better - we are not overloaded with sport on screen, but see enough to get an idea of the changes happening in the sport, and what we do see helps us feel in the thick of it.  The atmosphere of the time is often palpable, and in pace and story content this aspect of the movie works well, helped by some terrific supporting actor performances... Peter Gerety as the new commissioner of the sport is a treat, and Jonathan Pryce as the scheming agent is good value too.
In fact, the look of the movie, and the tone of the story, along with some wonderful one liners, make the movie worth watching.  On Blu-ray in particular the picture is immaculate.  One just wonders if Clooney did himself any favours by comparing himself to the greats so directly, as both actor and director.",1251417600,,2347,4.542654028436019

Rennee Zellwegger is Lexxie a reporter trying to dig up dirt on the war record of football's biggest star. I must say this is not one of her better roles. Trying to be authentic for the 1920's is just beyond easy for moviemakers. It is far enough in the past that to look good requires digital recreation. The crowds, the stadiums & more are a illusion. Also an illusion is any real chemistry between George & Rennee. They are both big stars in a relatively small movie. They play it for laughs. Lots of snarky, rapid-fire &  well delivered lines between the two of them keeps you entertained. The numerous train scenes are also enjoyable. The critics never fell love with this movie either but I'm sure fans did. The extras on this dvd are many & excellent. A story is told that Clooney is a irrepressible prankster.

In the 1920s, even though college football was regularly playing to sellout crowds, the professional side of the sport was as anathema to most Americans as Hulk Hogan being feted as guest-of-honor at the Queen's high tea.

Poorly regulated and sparsely attended, these early pro games were true spit-and-bailing-wire affairs, the players little more than a ragtag collection of ""miners and farmers and shell-shocked veterans of the Great War,"" the equipment well-worn or nonexistent, and as for venues - well, pretty much any turnip field that didn't have too much of a slant or too many holes in the ground would suffice in a pinch.  It was about as far from the multimillion dollar contracts and corporate sponsorships of today's NFL as one could possibly imagine.

It's nice to be reminded of football's humble beginnings every now and then, and ""Leatherheads,"" at least in theory, is just the movie to do it.

Based very loosely on fact, the screenplay tells the story of Jimmy ""Dodge"" Connelly (George Clooney, who also co-wrote and directed the film), a pro ball player who comes up with a scheme to save the league from extinction by recruiting the top player from Princeton, a charismatic war hero named Carter ""the Bullet"" Rutherford (""The Office""'s John Kransinski) to play for the Duluth Bulldogs.  This brings the fans to the arenas in record numbers, and pro football seems well on its way to a bright and lucrative future.  Enter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger), an acerbic ace reporter for the Chicago Tribune whose editors have sent her on assignment to investigate whether Rutherford's status as a war hero is really all it`s trumped up to be or whether it`s just a carefully manufactured fiction designed to boost his popularity with the fans - an expose that, if printed, could well spell doom not only for the young man himself but for the sport whose new-won fame is intricately linked to the prestige he alone confers upon it.

Done in the style of a 1930s screwball comedy, ""Leatherheads"" is filled with sharp-tongued characters who basically spoon and spar their way to a happy ending.  But while the movie certainly looks sensational and boasts tremendous star power in the likes of Clooney, Zellweger and Kransinski, the triteness of the storyline and the cutesiness of the humor rob it of much of its sophistication and charm (an attempt at a Keystone Kops parody is a particularly dopey and ill-conceived stab at period detail relevance).  Unfortunately, the farther the story drifts from the field and the history of football itself, the less compelling the movie becomes.  Thus, ""Leatherheads,"" with all its side forays into romantic schmaltz, corny newsroom melodrama and lowbrow slapstick, squanders its opportunity to be the first mainstream movie to truly explore the infancy of the game.  A pity.

On the other hand, the movie does contain some of the best art direction, costume design and cinematography of any movie in recent memory.  And that alone might make it worth checking out.",1248220800,3,3030,4.998011928429423
3493811,5,B001BL96JI,"LEATHERHEADS gets a wide range of reviews. I have to offer the highest honors. FIVE stars for the fun in Leatherheads.  It's simply a FUN flick.

Of course there is the fantastic acting by great stars, George Clooney and Renee Zellweger. Clooney also directs this picture. Both stars get two-hands-clapping for their very realistic performances. Believable people having FUN with their jobs. Clooney as a struggling football player during the beginning days of pro football, and Zellweger as a sexy reporter (in sexy period costumes) working her way to the editor's desk.  A Tribune story search of a college football star, who is also a war hero, who is going pro, will be the lead to the paper's plan of blowing the lid off the truth behind the hero's war event.

Of course with 'good-lookers' like Clooney and Zellweger, romance becomes a factor as well. You'll enjoy the banter between these 2 characters. It's FUNNY. FUN! It all takes place in delightful period scenes from the 30s/40s hotels to time-dated football fields.

For action there is bar room brawls, football (without rules), and a fist duel between the football stars, both desiring the great legged girl (Zellweger, she's HOT) from Chicago. Also see ""hunk"" Clooney with lipstick. Something for everyone. FUN.

The funny, special play of the day, at the end of the movie is worth a star itself.  And add another for all the great photos, each telling another story, in the ending credits. Be sure you don't turn off the TV till you've seen them all.  Great FUN.  Just a FUN DVD event for the family. PG-13 as it includes a few nasty words.

So this is one for the viewers liking comedy, &/or romance, football, action, drama, and FUN. Pop two bags of microwave popcorn and enjoy.

This George Clooney offering was such a hodge-podge of ho-hum I kept checking my watch and wondering what was happening over on the The Weather Channel.  Surely something more interesting, I remember thinking.  Impressive cinematography, minute attention to the looks, sounds, and vibes of 1925, and dynamic special effects bringing old sporting venues back to life were what held my interest, and kept me from hitting the channel selector.

Clooney plays an over-the-hill player/owner of a bankrupt professional football team (back during the days when football on the national sports scene was little more than an afterthought).  He's a bit of a con man (like we've never seen him in that vein before).  Renee Zellweger re-introduces (for the umpteenth time) the tough-talking, no-nonsense, female reporter who must use her brain and beauty to get ahead (pardon the pun) in a hopelessly misogynist world.  Bring boring John Krasisnski into the mix (playing a college football superstar and ""war hero""), and LEATHERHEADS becomes an uninteresting love triangle with a semi-interesting football climax.

On that second point, though, I liked that the storybook quality is diluted a little with some grit and humor, so the whole mythic feel isn't laid on too thick (as it was perhaps in the Redford film).  Also, the acting is very good, both the individual performances by George Clooney, Renee Zellweger, and John Krasinski, and the cute way the performances bounce off each other.

Not fatal but less successful is the story, which starts off well but then splinters off into a variety of subplots, themes, and plot points, so after a while one asks ""what is this movie exactly about?""  Make no mistake, we're not talking messy and incoherent, just a lack of focus.  And what focus there was sometimes seemed misplaced.  For example, an investigation into the truth of the Krasinski character's war record by Zellweger's reporter character took up a lot of time in the second half but didn't deliver narrative rewards or even entertaining plot developments.  It was just sort of there.

Despite those shortcomings, I'd definitely recommend ""Leatherheads"" for at least a viewing, primarily for the reasons stated at the outset.  Also, as far as modern movies are concerned, it was fun to see a film set in an underutilized era (the 1920's) about an underutilized subject (sports history).  So you see things you haven't seen in the movies a thousand times before.

The DVD offers top-notch picture and sound, which more than does justice to the original film's excellent cinematography.  Featurettes in the special features section are only a few minutes each, but there are a nice handful of them.  Paricularly interesting were the featurettes showing where special effects were applied to create crowds, stadiums that no longer actually exist, and other visual requirements.  Special effects aren't just about spaceships and monsters anymore; the most normal and mundane background scenes are now routinely created via digital wizardry.

For decent evening's entertainment, one can do worse than this DVD.",1242777600,2,2302,5.150537634408602
3493814,3,B001BL96JI,"Clooney tries to make a film as good as 'His Girl Friday'. 'Leatherheads' isn't as good as that classic, but it is enjoyable enough. Renee Zellweger, who I used to like, was the weak spot of the movie - she's adequate, but she's no Rosalind Russell, that's for sure. (I also thought she was the weak spot in 'Cinderella Man', an otherwise strong film.) Clooney does his typical self-deprecating role, with good comedic effect. And the film looks good, all sepia-toned and Roaring Twenties styles.",1242518400,,496,4.847058823529411

Clooney's film brought my mental images to life and it's amazing how they are right on target. This film is a good film, from cinematography to effects to acting to writing. I'm partial to the historical period, so I'm a little biased here. But overall it's a good piece of entertainment. George Clooney is the genuine article and it comes through in his work.",1241395200,,456,4.7125
3493817,3,B001BL96JI,"The beginning of this movie is so very slow, it almost made be give up on it.  For the first half-hour (at least, it felt that long), nothing really happened.  Okay, yes, I know there were plot points, and there was a story, but it was boring.  It was hard not to make the universal 'speed it up' hand gesture at the television.  I admit there were a few good lines, but it was hard to see where the plot was heading.

Once they recruit the college player, however, the movie slowly starts to turn around.  I still wasn't horribly impressed, but it started to get more interesting.  By the time we learn his real story, I'm hooked (personally, I think the real events were more interesting...).  And the last play of the football game... truly priceless.

Any football fan should definitely watch this movie.  Yes, it's slow in the beginning.  Yes, it takes awhile for the plot to develop.  Yes, it's still only a three-star movie because it makes you sit through a lot to get to the good part.  No, you can't just fast-forward to the end because, it turns out, the plot is relevant.  Still, it's worth watching... and it will at least be something to give you a football fix in the off-season...",1241222400,,1196,4.451612903225806
3493818,2,B001BL96JI,"I am usually a big fan of anything George Clooney does, but this time...not so much.

""Leatherheads"" is billed as a screwball comedy, but I think I only laughed a grand total of three times during the entire film. The story is set in 1925, back in the days when professional football was just getting started. In an effort to revive his failing team, the Duluth Bulldogs, Dodge Connelly (George Clooney) recruits a popular college player, Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski), to lend his name to the game and help legitimize the sport. However, Carter has a secret about his alleged war hero past, and Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger), a Chicago reporter, is determined to crack the story. Both Carter and Dodge fall hard for Lexie and try to win her over as she desperately tries to maintain her tough exterior and reveal the truth about Carter's past.

This movie sucks on a variety of levels. The story itself is mildly interesting, but there's not anything funny about this movie, which makes it fail miserably as a comedy. Clooney and Zellweger have absolutely no onscreen chemistry whatsoever, but the worst thing about ""Leatherheads"" is the fact that Zellweger is in it at all. She is such a terrible actress and just seems to get worse and worse over time. She is absolutely horrible in this movie, and I literally cringed every time her scrunched-up face appeared on the screen.

I'm very happy that I didn't shell out the money to see this film in the theatre. George Clooney, I still love you madly, but this movie was kind of a dud.",1240012800,,1557,4.716911764705882

I enjoyed everyone in the film.

It's nice to have a fun movie that we could all enjoy and not have to fast forward through anything.  This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously and I think that's where most of the negative reviews probably came from - reviewers overanalyzing something that is straight up, in your face, silly.  No amount of analyzing will change that because it's meant to be silly.

This movie is about the sport of football before it was ruined by rules, hoopla, investments by corporations for commercials, and other changes that all led to the control of football because of investment money after Super Bowl VII (The year Miami went undefeated 17-0).
 This movie is a period piece, very similar to ""Eight Men Out"" in style and filming and even the portrayal of characters. It informs us of when football became more professional, in an era of freedom unlike the game you see today.

I've received and sent back 4 different Leatherheads DVDs with netflix.  Once I finally researched it a bit I found the truth.  It's an intentionally crippled product.

Except that pro football, back then, was considered the ugly cousin of college football, a sport which gloriously reigned supreme. However, once graduated from college, one is supposed to go and get a real grown-up job. For pro footballer Dodge Connelly (Clooney) and his rowdy ragtag bunch of Duluth Bulldogs, it's a life of irrelevance and being made much fun of. The Bulldogs once even had to forfeit a game when they, as the home team, couldn't provide a backup football. Oh, the shame...

But when Dodge learns that his team is about to go bust, he concocts a scheme to popularize the Bulldogs and, along the way, legitimize pro football. His big move is to recruit to Duluth celebrated American war hero turned college football star, Carter ""the Bullet"" Rutherford. And, sure 'nuff, this draws in the big crowds. And, because this is that kind of movie, into the picture sashays the sassy, fast-talking newspaper journalist dame. She's out to nab the dirty scoop on Rutherford, pro football's sudden golden goose. Shades of HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO!

Apparently, there's some doubt as to Rutherford's heroism in the war.

Reportedly, the script to this film had been floating around for decades, until George Clooney snatched it and reworked it and filmed it. But someone dropped the ball somewhere, and it could've been Clooney himself who did the oopsey. This is his third directing gig, which only proves that the third time is not necessarily the charm. Good actor that he is, witty and charming that he is, George Clooney has been in plenty of terrific flicks. But LEATHERHEADS has to be tossed onto his miniscule pile of clunkers. Clooney can hold his own in a drama or a thriller. And, certainly, he's starred in several comedies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Fine-Day/dp/B00006ZXSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Fine Day</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intolerable-Cruelty-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intolerable Cruelty (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the pretty great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>). So why isn't LEATHERHEADS much better?

Don't play, I love screwball comedies. When it's done proper, screwball films are howlingly funny and even cathartic. LEATHERHEADS tries to angle for a screwball tone. George Clooney is engaging and funny as the lead. Renee Zellweger also brings it, even if I struggle to get past that weird, gone puffy face, and even if she and Clooney don't really register much of a chemistry. There's even someone relegated to that also-ran Ralph Bellamy role. But mostly LEATHERHEADS fails to get it right. It collapses under the weak jokes and gags and the repartee comprising of tired, hand-me-down stuff.

- Stuffy guy: ""I didn't come over here to be insulted.""
- Sassy girl reporter: ""No? Where do you usually go?""

Snappy banter? Maybe many decades ago. And I got caught cringing when, in a painfully unfunny scene, George and Renee try to pass themselves off as cops to escape a bar raid. In indulging in so much poorly executed slapstick, the film loses its grounding; what should've have been a memorable sports backdrop loses much of its resonance. Clooney has claimed that Carter ""the Bullet"" Rutherford is loosely based on hall-of-famer Harold ""Red"" Grange, who not only was possibly American football's first superstar but who also touted one of my favorite nicknames, the Galloping Ghost. I was very curious to see how this rough-and-tumble gridiron sport, which featured men playing under harsh, rigorous conditions and gigged out only in flimsy padding and puny leather helmets, made the transition into something credible. So, going into LEATHERHEADS, I was raring to be bowled over and be wowwed. But, no.

Naturally, it all culminates in the Big Game, which provides possibly my favorite moment in the film. The only thing I'll say about it is that it involves the Sergeant York ploy. It's one of the few times I laughed.

But, in terms of quality, in richness and resonance and wit and dialogue, LEATHERHEADS is nowhere close to BULL DURHAM. LEATHERHEADS is fluff.",1226793600,2,5214,6.124487004103967
3493837,3,B001BL96JI,"I'm no fan of football, and believe me, it's not for lack of trying. I want to be that guy who has the team football jersey, can rattle off the names of various players of numerous teams, have a fantasy football habit, and be able to toss the ol' pigskin in my backyard with friends. I've made myself sit down and watch it, and while I understand the game mechanics, I just can't seem to get into the game itself. Ironically, and for reasons I will never be able to understand or adequately explain, I really enjoy football movies though. Necessary Roughness, The Replacements, and Rudy are all great movies (among many others not listed here) and I really enjoy watching them.

That said ""Leatherheads"" is not your typical football movie. The film (which I'm assuming is a heavily fictionalized, if not outright made up, version of historical accounts) covers the creation of professional football in 1920's America. George Clooney is an aging football player who's having trouble holding his pro-team together as it seems to make no money. He comes up with the bright idea of hiring a college football star/war hero, played by John Krasinski of ""The Office"" fame, to generate interest in pro-football and bring in the big bucks. There's a subplot wherein Renee Zellweger's character, a newspaper reporter, wants to investigate Krasinski's war record and see if he really is the war hero he claims to be.

First off, if you're thinking this is going to be a movie about team building and working together to overcome adversity, look elsewhere. The actual game of football inhabits only a small fraction of the total film. In fact I think the audience gets to spend more time riding trains than anything else, but I digress. Clooney's character is witty and funny but beyond that he sort of meanders from scene to scene with no real objective than to hook up with Renee Zellweger's character. Successfully getting pro football started is more or less just a side benefit. I couldn't help but like Krasinski's character in the movie, who comes across as pretty likeable despite his being portrayed as an attention grabbing, big-shot celebrity. In fact the only thing I found a little disconcerting was his attraction to Zellweger's character, who is clearly *much* older than his own.

And then there's Renee Zellweger's character. I know that the movie producers wanted her to be the well liked heroine of the movie, but for me the effort failed pretty badly. I didn't like the fact that her character was singularly devoted to the destruction of a person with no real benefit to anyone. Why do it at all? Krasinski's character didn't steal the glory from someone else, nor did his actions end up harming anyone (in fact they saved a great deal of people's lives on both sides, even if it was an accident) so why destroy him? And that her character did all of this with a clear conscience bothered me that much more.

None of the other characters really gets enough face time to warrant mention, which is rather sad because this kind of movie really begs for it. There's no teamwork here at all...players gather on the field and play, and then they disperse at the end, and then predictably get on another train (lots of trains in this movie).

If I have to give points to Leatherheads it's for the excellent cinematography. The producers really spared no expense in convincing the audience that this film is set in the 1920's and really pulled it off. Between the art-deco and myriad Model-T's the movie was beautifully styled and had me pretty well convinced that that's what the 1920's looked like. This did not cross as well into the comedic aspects of the film, which I think were supposed to draw from Keystone Kops type slapstick of the era. The timing was right for the pratfalls and what not, but it just wasn't that funny. And sometimes I think they put extra scenes into the movie just to introduce another unfunny slapstick moment, such as the superfluous speakeasy chase in which Clooney and Zellweger meet for some adult beverages at an underground bar. The bar is busted up by the police and our heroes end up knocking out two police with a well-timed door slam, stealing their uniforms, and then end up getting pursued throughout the city for the better part of what felt like 20 minutes. It added nothing to the movie. In fact my wife and I were both somewhat surprised at the tenacity of the continued pursuit, given that it wasn't as if the heroes had robbed a bank or murdered anyone. But maybe that's just me.

The plot is very convoluted and I found myself wondering why characters were doing what they were doing since there was no real direction for the plot. Everyone meanders about the screen, and I'm no expert on filmmaking, but I have a hunch that this may have been *intentional*. Sigh. Overall I view Leatherheads as a movie that all but screams the word ""mediocrity"", and largely a symptom of the endless stream of average movies that Hollywood pumps out each year. C'mon Hollywood...there must be a better way.",1226448000,,5043,4.725

This is another Clooney movie where he is both an actor and the director, but unlike Good Night and Good Luck I didn't really care too much about what was going on.

Clooney is a man who really wants to keep professional football going and must find a way for that to happen. He manages to recruit the best player in college football, Carter Rutherford. In addition to that he's also a WWI hero. But is he really? Added to that mix is Lexie Littleton, a reporter, who is trying to figure out if Rutherford is really all he's made out to be.

Through this whole movie it just goes. I mean there's not much comedy, there's not much romance, there's not much football. There's not much of anything to really keep you glued to your seat. The actors in this movie are really talented so maybe it was the script. I don't know. The ending wasn't what I expected and frankly...I wouldn't have gone with that ending.

Watch it if you want. But it's not a must see movie.",1225238400,,1071,4.393939393939394

3493843,1,B001BL96JI,This is one of the worst movies ever made.  The script is so lame after about 1/2 hour you just don't care anymore.  I shut it off about 3/4 of the way through because I couldn't take it anymore.  It really doesn't deserve anymore of a review than this.,1224288000,3,253,4.122448979591836
3493844,4,B001BL96JI,"This was not only a great film for good, clean laughs (only the characters get dirty out in the field), but was educational as well.  I don't know how historically accurate it is, but I learned a lot about the beginnings of professional football.  It was also refreshing to watch a movie about football that didn't put me to sleep but actually kept me engaged throughout.  George Clooney and his motley band of not very professional players who wouldn't know a rule book if it was thrown at them find out what it's like to go against the big guns of college football (with Jonathon Pryce as a rather greasy villain).  Meanwhile, Renee Zellwegger plays a wonderfully savvy, manipulative reporter who's after the news story of a lifetime and uncovers a rather embarrassing fact about the new all-star player's past in the Great War.  A great bunch of characters, a heart-warming tale, and lots of laughs for the whole family.",1224028800,2,923,4.74375

From the first scene with a cow (that's all I'm going to say), you know this movie is going to be silly fun.  It's in the spirit of John Cleese movies (the funny bantering) and O Brother where Art Thou?

3493846,2,B001BL96JI,"Leatherheads should have been a great movie. Any time he's not being political, I love George Clooney as an actor. I'm a big fan of The Office and John Krasinski. I've had crush on Renee Zellweger since Jerry Maguire. And, I love football. So,  you think a movie that has all these elements would be amazing. Unfortunately, due to spotty characterization and lack of focus, the movie ultimately fails.

Dodge Connolly (Clooney) is an aging football starts for the rag-tag, financially strapped, Duluth Bulldogs. There is no professional football league, no NFL. The team folds and Connolly has an idea. He recruits college star Carter Rutheford (Krasinski) to play for his team. This, of course draws huge crowds and the popularity of pro football grows. Lexie Littleton (Zellweger) is a Chicago Tribune who is given the assignment of finding out why Rutheford's claim to be a war hero is false.

If you've seen the previews, you'll know a love triangle developes between the three main characters. I thought this was handled incredibly poorly as I had reason to care for none of the characters. I won't go into the reasons why, but the relationship between the three main stars is what ruined the movie for me. The movie is at its best when it goes the slapstick route or features back and forth banter between Clooney, Zellweger and Krasinski. The movie fails when it does drama. And for a football movie, there isn't much football.

Overall, I was disappointed in this movie. It had all the ingredients to be a hit. But it just didn't work.",1223942400,3,1543,4.7894736842105265
3493847,4,B001BL96JI,"This was an okay, old-school comedy, with director George Clooney playing an over-the-hill roughneck 1920s football player trying how to figure out how to crack into the big leagues. Renee Zellweger plays a tough-talking ""girl reporter"" (ala Katherine Hepburn) who falls into a love-hate flirtation with him... The movie tries, perhaps too hard, to recreate the snappy, zinger-heavy feel of the classic screwball comedies of the 1930s and '40s, and while this film isn't quite ""Dinner At Eight"" or ""Bringing Up Baby,"" it still has a nice, easygoing charm.  In its hazy, golden-lit nostalgia, it also evokes '70s films such as ""Paper Moon"", etc., that both nod towards the past and give it a little modernistic goose. Personally, I wasn't blown away by this film, but I did appreciate what Clooney was up to, and I think he did a fairly good job making a lighthearted, un-cynical, un-violent, un-grotesque film -- a welcome break from the unending stream of brainlessness and loud noise streaming out of Hollywood these days. Worth checking out... a 3.5, perhaps?  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1223856000,,1099,5.1
3493848,3,B001BL96JI,"The '08 film `Leatherheads' is a perfect example of a good concept left unrealized. Attempting to tap into the American sports psyche and our innate fondness for things nostalgic, a film about the 1920's and the birth of professional football certainly sounded like the beginnings of an entertaining storyline. Complimented by a strong cast consisting of such talents as; George Clooney, Renee Zellweger and John Krasinski (The Office) things appeared to be starting out on a positive note and the viewing audience had no reason to suspect anything other than success for this production.

Unfortunately from my personal perspective things simply didn't go as planned.  While the film successfully captures a `20's ambiance in set design, costumes and soundtrack, the film is otherwise flat, listless and lacking in soul. There are no special memorable moments in this movie whether they be romantic, comedic, athletic or otherwise. Thus the audience is left with a rather tired, glad-the-movies-over feel.

Furthermore, the love/hate relationship between George Clooney and Renee Zellwegger doesn't work at all. There dialogue may come across as crisp and witty but there's not chemistry between them, or personal attachment in their banter. Not only that, they don't come across as particularly likeable people so the viewer doesn't really care if they eventually end up together or not.  I did enjoy the performance of John Krasinski, his youthful, boyish charm provided the few bright moments in the film.

Bottom Line, `Leatherheads' is one of those inexplicable films that seemed to have all the right components that somehow just didn't come together. Who knows why?",1223683200,3,1673,5.346007604562738
3493849,2,B001BL96JI,I thought this movie was pretty good. It is old school humor but it has a few yucks in there. Clooney is always good but this movie misses as compared to some of his better comedy roles. I still enjoyed it and think that it will get over with most. It just wasn't great.,1223251200,,270,4.018518518518518
3493850,1,B001BL96JI,"This movie had one chance. To take the direction it was going in (cynical reporter sense war story not legit) and turn it around 180 degrees. That is, the ""wonder-boy,"" who everyone expects to be an arrogant liar, is, in actuality, fairly innocent of any of the dirty-dealing that Clooney and Zellwigger seem so upset about. He could have become Zellwigger's love interest and perhaps had a creative twist. No luck.  He encouraged a platoon of Germans to surrender by waking up behind them and shouting in German ""We surrender"" and they all gave up. That got blown up to make him look bigger. Big deal! It was slapstick mixed with narrow-minded mean-spiritted attitude it seems to me on the part of Zellwigger and Clooney. Then Clooney punches the guy out cold in a game witnessed by thousands of people but nobody notices. Thats when i shut it off. Zellwigger, never known as a cheesecake, had better stop taking these roles before she starts embarrassing herself. Her face looked like a puffy 50-year old, and the whole movie left that ""left-wing, anti-war hero"" stench so popular amongst Hollywood's elite. Trash and burn.

Piece of FACT: Lawrence of Arabia was in actuality,nothing more than a ""leader"" of a rag-tag bunch of Arabs that cleaned up after the British army had fought, and was content with whatever spoils they could steal. That was his ""army.""",1223251200,5,1361,4.836909871244635
3493851,1,B001BL96JI,"As a football and history fan, *fortunately* I only rented this. What starts off well as an interesting comedy about the early days of pro football later degenerates into yet another ""hero journalist"" and ""there are no war heroes"" styled story. I should've known that something involving Clooney couldn't possibly just be taken at face value with his recent history of pretentious work like Syriana and Good Night and Good Luck.

What transpires is that Clooney's pro team is struggling and folds because pro football is a joke in 1925. The big-nosed guy from the Office is a college star and war hero (from WWI). Clooney meets with him and his agent to get him to play for Duluth and invigorate interest in the pro game of football. Rene Zellweger is a squinty-eyed (but isn't she always?) journalist sent to basically ruin the mythology of the college star's war record for ... basically no reason at all.

I hate to break it Clooney and are film viewers here, but a lot of strange things happen during wartime. Some people get too much credit for events, others get no credit at all. Probably because these stories end up working their way thru several military bureaucracies. So the idea of some major newspaper wanting to ruin one of the war heroes 6 or 7 years after the fact seems to be pretty ludicrous on it's face. Except in the context of ""I hate the American war-monger"" and ""the press is great and always right"" George Clooney.

With these offensive elements aside, I'd give the film a ""3"" but the political content drives it down to a ""1"" for me.",1223078400,9,1560,4.624548736462094
3493852,4,B001BL96JI,"In the 1920's the best football games were found on college campuses.  In this movie, George Clooney's character is an aging football player who is trying to put pro football on the map.  He pirates a popular war hero turned Princeton football player and suddenly the crowds begin to follow the pro teams.  Renee Zellweger is a sassy, saucy girl reporter who catches Clooney's eye, but seems more interested in the war hero.  This is a fun movie which does a great job of depicting the mid-20's while being light and entertaining.",1222992000,,530,4.728260869565218
3493853,4,B001BL96JI,"Harken back to the days when professional football was played on muddy fields by players who would rather brawl than run the gridiron with grace and the scoreboard was hard to see under the huge shadow cast by the major college game.

George Clooney - director, producer, ""co-writer"" - stars in this comedy about the fictional Duluth Bulldogs (in the early NFL years, there was the Duluth Eskimos and Canton Bulldogs) and a league on the verge of financial ruin. The fate of pro football hinges on the signing of a former college superstar who is a combat hero.

With the characters loosely based on iconic figures from the early years of the NFL - George ""Papa Bear"" Halas, John ""Blood"" McNally, Red Grange - Clooney, as team captain Dodge Connolly, weaves the pursuit of star Carter ""the Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski), with the chase for attention from Lexie Littleton, a Chicago news reporter (Rene Zellweger).

The slapstick draws from the 1920s-era films that had football as its backdrop, but the climax is the universal debate by fans of big market versus small market, with ""free agency"" in the controversy. It is a fun gridiron film that refuses to get too serious.",1222819200,,1180,4.8316831683168315

3493855,3,B001BL96JI,"It's hard to determine what was really needed to make this a better film, but something... that one magic ingredient... surely is missing and without it this movie finds itself solidly in the middle of the pack.  It's not bad, but far from great, leaving a 3 star recommendation for those that want to know if this film is worth nearly 2 hours of their time.

Leatherheads was promoted (in trailers) as a screwball comedy and I suppose it tries to achieve that on some levels, but it never quite delivers on that promise as it tries to include a love story and a story of a hero that perhaps shouldn't be a hero at all, and oh, yeah, it also tries to tell a story about football back in the days of leather helmets being played in front of few fans in places that wouldn't be thought of as being historically significant to the game.  In some ways this seems to be a football version of the Will Ferrell film: Semi-pro.  It's got the screwed up players, the faltering league, the guy with the plan, and other formulaic elements that were simply transferred from the basketball story over to a story about professional football.

Clooney does well, and John Krasinski isn't bad either.  Rene Zellweger is ok in the obligatory role as the femme fatale reporter that is looking for the real story behind Krasinski's would be hero.  Outside of those characters, and Jonathan Pryce's role, the rest of the performances and players are ok though none really stand-out.

George Clooney directed this film and seems to have achieved an apparent goal of delivering a nostalgic experience, though the images are often what some would call bland, dusty or muddy.  There's plenty of detail, but the color palette is meant to present a nostalgic appearance and oh, yeah, also is often focused on a football field where players are getting muddy and dirty.

Worth a rental, but the buy-it recommendation would seem to be outside the value that seems to be delivered here.",1222473600,,1957,4.662790697674419

 This is a George Clooney movie by all measures.  Clooney is the star of the film.  He is the director of the film.  He even has an un-credited role in part of the writing of the film.
 As an actor here Clooney is peerless.  He is goofy where he should be goofy and silly where he should be silly.  He is also sharp as a tack in his relationship with his leading lady, Rene Zellweger.  From the little noted Empire Records through a dozen films Zellweger has proven herself to be among the very top of currently working actresses.  This movie is designed to recall the great goof ball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.  The key is the clever repartee between the two leading actors.  It is very good stuff, funny, witty and charming.  And it is about as solid as a feather duster.  It is great fun to watch.
 Zellweger, or as I refer to her, that actress with the un-pronounceable name, plays a news hen who is not quite as hard boiled as she thinks she is.  Clooney is a professional football player in 1925.  In those days pro football was little distinguished from pick up games in a pasture.  Clooney must not just play for the team but hustle to make sure that the team survives in an unkind environment.  There are no rules, which makes things interesting.  One of the professional players for instance is a High School kid about the size and weight of a Frigidaire full of beer.
 As a director Clooney works with a deft hand and a clever mind.  There are lots of tiny touches which do so much to make a movie more fun, a big lineman smoking a cigarette while sitting on the sidelines being only one such.  It is just a three second shot with no dialog but it is a good shot.
 Leatherheads runs a long one hour and 54 minutes.  The PG 13 movie cost a published $58 million but took in only $12 million on its debut weekend.  The backers must be disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed.  I give this fun and funny comedy a full three saw blades.",1479600000,,1960,4.31043956043956
