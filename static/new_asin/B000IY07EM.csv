However , from the very first music notes of the Czech Christmas Mass I felt that something special was about to happen .  I was not disappointed .  The simple words of the mass , beginning with the tenor saying :  ' Hey Master , rise up quickly ' ,  and the bass responding :  ' Now , now , why do you disturb my sleep ? ' , and the rest , accompanied with the rustic , wooden , moving-mechanical dioramas , hold one enthralled .  This is relaxing Christmas music of the first order , performed admirably by all , especially the bass , Richard Novak .",1427328000,,704,4.050724637681159
8147769,5,B000IY07EM,"My family and I enjoy viewing this excellent DVD several times each year, particularly of course during the Christmas season.  ""Christmas Carols"" evokes rustic Bohemiana and medieval piety with apparently authentic costuming, cinematic beauty, and personable characters who project good humor and earnest faith.  Ryba's ""Mass"" is not a liturgical mass at all, but rather a narrative of the nativity.  His music appeals to our taste for something simple and sincere in faith, yet it represents a very solid Classics echelon of musicality.  Ryba composed about 1400 works of all sorts, including Mozart-like sonatas, but is best beloved for ""Czech Christmas Mass"".  Most charming in this DVD are cutaways to hand-carved nativity scenes that feature ingenious moving parts: men sawing logs, women spinning yarn, shepherds herding, artisans at their workbenches, lambs grazing. Evidently the producers wanted us to appreciate Bohemia's legacy of elaborate folk art.  The tunes are memorable and can be enjoyed by all, whether or not the Czech language is understood.  This DVD is one of a kind.  Certainly people of Czechoslovak or perhaps any European heritage should appreciate it.  Highly satisfying and easily worth the price.",1335052800,4,1226,5.444444444444445
