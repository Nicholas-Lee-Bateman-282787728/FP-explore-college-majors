8543064,5,B001POGTMI,"What Brad Mays has accomplished here is a truthful reflection of the chaotic primaries. The caucus frauds, the rush to hold the D.N.C. accountable and the many problems that came up in the first seven weeks of PUMA. This story is important, much of it was not covered truthfully by the MSM and there was much to tell. The film does a good job of observing the dedication of average American's to the voting process during this over the top extraordinary year. I am so relieved to see an accounting warts and all of this story. This film is an important document. You will not see this accurate a portrayal anywhere else! Do not miss this!!!",1237248000,6,640,4.525862068965517
