The horrors that this movie depicts leaves one feeling very sad, indeed.  And yet, these types of things can happen again if we're not careful.  History can, and will, repeat itself if we do not use common sense to stop egomaniacs like this doctor.  How many hundreds of ruined lives did he leave in the wake of his malpractice?  Unfortunately, he really did believe in the process.....even when he ended up killing people as a result of it!  How sad.",1343260800,,639,4.711711711711712

3092531,5,B0012M1KWC,"Who Knew that the breakthrough medical procedure of the late 1940's would be condemned as barbaric and ineffective within a decade?  This PBS documentary is mesmerizing in its telling of not only the treatment of mental illness but the famed treator.  Dr. Walter Freeman, at the time considered a pioneer and innovator in the treatment of mental illness, is believed to have been a man who truly wanted to help patients of this disease during a time when America's asylums could only house them in deplorable conditions with no hope for cure or release.

I really enjoyed how this documentary gave the history and circumstances that culminated in Dr. Freeman's decade of free reign to practice Prefrontal Orbital Lobotomy on mental patients with the blessings of the medical profession. His lobotomy procedure was hailed so convincingly as a cure-all by reputable medical organizations (Johns Hopkins) and print media that Joseph Kennedy, the millionaire father of future president John F. Kennedy, asked for and authorized Dr. Freeman to perform his groundbreaking procedure on daughter Rosemary Kennedy.  Rosemary would never be the same.

You have to see this documentary to feel in your bones the chilling effects of the instruments and procedure Dr. Freeman used.  A tool that looked like an icepick was inserted right above the eyeball under the eyelid near the upper nasal area.  A small mallet was used to strike the icepick forcing it through bone and wedging it into the frontal lobe of the brain.  The good doctor then moved the device left to right and up and down scrambling the membrane known as the Thalamus.  Mind you Dr. Freeman came up with this procedure as a cost-effective alternative to his drilling holes in patient's skulls and scooping at the Thalamus.  The procedure could be done in four minutes flat.

And take a guess at what pharmaceutical drug helped end the reign of Dr. Freeman's brain scrambling procedure?  Thorazine.  Thorazine was initially marketed as the ""chemical lobotomy.""

Dr. Freeman's commitment to his beliefs as well as his drive for historical fame most likely blinded him to the reality of lobotomy as a failure.  As for the American Medical profession, who at first backed then abandoned their support of Dr. Freeman, we as sufferers of all illnesses in America should be forewarned.  When hearing of new groundbreaking medical procedures and medicines today we should stop, get the facts and then question those pushing the newly discovered breakthrough on us. It just may be a faster, cheaper way to treat the poor or those without healthcare.  But the real question is does it work?  The Horror!",1292889600,,2648,5.034403669724771
3092532,4,B0012M1KWC,Very good short history of lobotomies.  It was rather short in length and left me wanting to learn more.  It is also pretty graphic and I had to look away at times.,1259971200,4,164,4.09375
3092533,5,B0012M1KWC,"American Experience: The Lobotomist tells the not so pretty story of the rise and fall of Dr. Walter Freeman and his surgical lobotomy procedure, a controversial treatment even when it was done in large numbers in an attempt to treat patients with chronic and severe forms of mental illness. This type of surgery took place, for the most part, back in the 1930s, 1940s and even the 1950s when psychiatric hospitals were little more than warehouses for people with mental illness; the best of the best simply had no idea how to treat them besides observation.

Enter Walter Freeman. The grandson of a doctor who was famous for the fist successful removal of a brain tumor on a living patient, Dr. Freeman wanted to prove himself a God. This wasn't all too hard at the time since doctors were generally regarded as Gods and almost nobody ever questioned their authority. In Dr. Freeman's time patients simply complied and there was no such thing as ""informed consent."" Freeman wanted solutions for chronic mental illness and he wanted them fast just as he also wanted fame and fortune for his efforts. He read so much that he finally discovered a crude form of lobotomy and after a few years of making this procedure a bit more sophisticated (not that it ever was an answer nor did it turn out to be sophisticated in any true way), lobotomies across the nation were occurring more and more frequently. Eventually thousands of people were having lobotomies and despite the fact that the results weren't really all that positive Dr. Freeman continued his surgery which was sometimes done outside a hospital in a most unprofessional way.

Even then, when some of his medical peers strongly disapproved of the procedure, Freeman was able to do lobotomies because at that time doctors simply didn't badmouth a peer in public and they had to admit they themselves lacked any other way to try to help very ill people. The story moves on from here to examine other angles of the story (I don't want to spoil it for you) and we see and learn in detail what eventually happened to Dr. Freeman and his now infamous lobotomy procedure.

The movie flows along well and the interviews with relatives, professionals and even one man who was lobotomized at the tender age of 12 really make this program on DVD fascinating. The archival footage is very well presented although some of it will be a bit tough to take for sensitive people.

In addition, the DVD comes without extras unless you count the referral to the PBS website for more information on this topic. I would have loved a few extras; but the film is so well done with its interviews that I can overlook this disappointment.

This film tells quite a story and I highly recommend it for students of psychology. People in any other field who interact with or treat mentally ill persons would do well to add this to their collections.",1257984000,20,2876,4.709741550695825
3092534,5,B0012M1KWC,"""The Reserve"" by Russell Banks uses the lobotomy as a plot device.  It is an excellent book.  The audio version, narrated by Tom Stechschulte, is one of the best performances I have heard.",1206057600,2,188,4.666666666666667
3092535,5,B0012M1KWC,"Until the 1930's,mentally ""unstable"" or ""depressed"" or ""insane"" people were often institutionalized,forgotten or considered an embarrassment to the family. Walter Freeman,the son of an American leading doctor,Dr. Keene, with much to prove and ambition for fame,began to ""rescue"" the mentally troubled by working on and seeking to perfect the bi-orbital frontal lobotomy- a technique whereby an simple ice pick is tapped into the frontal lobe of the brain and render the patient docile,relieved of all anxiety, thus ""cured"".The medical community and psychiatric community at first was skeptical,but within the shortest period of time began hailing Freeman.s lobotomy as standard medical procedure,so much so, that many unqualified people began to perform this simple five minute procedure!!!This ""cure"" would potentially end psychiatry (which carries it's own baggage) as we knew it.

If you want to watch this 60 minute special from PBS' 'American Experience"", your hair will stand on end and questions will be raised in your minds about how quickly people search for ""miracle cures"" and how haphazardly the revered medical community can toss aside all good and correct scientific practice in the light of continued evaluation over a period of time! People flocked in droves to have this procedure done. Families,burdened with a loved one who was mentally imbalanced made decisions under a doctor's advice to have the lobotomy done.

This documentary explores Walter Freeman,and at times villaifies and at times praises his work. This is how he was viewed by two camps in his lifetime. Was he a sane and rational scientist,or was he a egotistical maniac bent on fame?

I first became aware of lobotomy when as an 11 year old I was driven through a Mental Institution near Philadelphia where you could view lobotomy patients caged in yards in full view! This was legal in 1966! I have NEVER forgotten it. The next time lobotomy was presented to me was in the famous film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frances/dp/B00005OCK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frances</a>&nbsp;starring Jessica Lange (nominated for an Oscar) concerning the actress Frances Farmer who was forced against her will to be lobotomized. The other famous person that I recalled was Rosemary Kennedy,(yes of THE Kennedy's) who was lobotomized at 23 in order to avoid political scandal that might keep the Kennedy boys from being elected!(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kennedys-of-Massachusetts/dp/6303636365/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kennedys of Massachusetts</a>

In his 70's, Freeman,discredited and forced not to practice medicine by the very community that once hailed him as saviour,sought atonement or vindication by tracking down his thousands of patients seeking to verify that his work WAS scientifically successful. Crushed by his findings, he died a short while later in 1972.

I recently wanted to have lazer surgery performed on my eyes. My physician advised against it with one brief statement: ""There simply has not been enough time to evaluate scientifically if this procedure is a cure or if it will have serious repercussions down the road"".I respected his scientifically conservative opinion and still wear glasses and contacts!!
Thank God, also, that therapists are still around instead of lobotomy (although the postscript of this DVD states that lobotomies are still performed in ""most extreme cases""....now who decides that?)

Walter Freeman-villain or saint?...Oh did I forget that lobotomy was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize? Now reason that one out if you are in YOUR right mind! Did you take your VIOXX,CELEBREX or THORAZINE today?",1200960000,34,3706,5.716878402903811

3092537,2,B0012M1KWC,"Dolley Madison episode is very biased. It states the British 'attacked and kidnapped British sailors'. This is a typical example of biased historical nonsense. The British never 'attacked' those ships, they stopped them and impressed British born sailors into service (impressment is a practice the US also indulged in) they never impressed American born sailors, they then sent the ships to a British port where they purchased all the american goods and sent them on their way (as there was an embargo on France and they prevented american goods from getting to France, much like WW1 and 2 with Germany).

 In regards to the burning of Washington, they seem to forget to mention the fact it was in retaliation of an American attack on a Canadian city that they burned to the ground, they also conveniently refuse to acknowledge the fact the British targeted no civilians, and even freed some slaves whilst they were in that area.",1512086400,,930,4.917197452229299

This is some sick stuff and what's worst is that the people who promoted and practice it truly believe they're doing what's right!  It's inhuman what happens in the course of this documentary, and that it was sanctioned by the government - state and local.

3092549,3,B0012M1KWC,"Enjoyable. Thought-provoking. Educational.  PBSs American Experience creates some memorable episodes but Earth Days is one of the few that stands out.  It is an absolutely engaging feature film that not only brings together the major contributors to the creation of earth day, it presents the evolution of American environmental movement as the greatest contribution former hippies left for future generations.

Earth days is a 2009  documentary featured as an episode of American Episode that combines archival footage and interviews with notable environmental activists regard from about the 1950s to a little beyond the 1990s. Contrasting the related footage of politicians and newsreels are interviews with the Stewart Udall, Paul Ehrlich, Stewart Brand, Rusty Schweickart, and others about history and their contribution to environmentalism in America.  Its incredible history  using Rachel Carsons Silent Spring as a catalyst, most of the interviewee were inspired to create and mold the movement into a distinct political force that would culminate with the election and stutter badly with the election of Reagan in 1980. For most people, its difficult to imagine a time when America conducted nuclear test and factories routinely dumped unprocessed waste water to the point that a river caught fire.

I really enjoyed this particular episode.  In addition to content, the soundtrack continues the utilitarian classical SimCity-type that Robert Stone is known for.  There is one problem though  this movie only available in SD!  How can that be!?  PBS featured this in HD and SD on a 720p screen like mine looks terrible.  While I put the blame on Amazon not to have the HD available and presentation aside, it is still an evocative and informative film.",1475280000,,1761,5.36

They are always of the highest quality and cover many topics, ranging from history, to science and technology, war, biographies, popular culture -- the list goes on!

And you can pick and choose which episodes you want to buy.  I've bought and watched several of those in Volume 1, and learned a lot from each.  I was especially pleased with the ones on Dolley Madison, the history of Earth Day and the environmental movement, and the one on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer.  I've long been interested in the history of science and technology and have read quite a number of books about Oppenheimer, his career and the building of the atomic bomb.  This one talked to people who knew him, and several who have written about him, including the author of ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", Richard Rhodes -- a work that is itself excellent and one that I've read several times.

I'm in the middle of the episode on the polio crusade and look forward to many others.  They're all good and I always learn something new, no matter how much I thought I knew beforehand.

It addressed the cruel treatment of those who worked on the ships, their food, clothing, and shelter.  The video also spent time on Herman Melville, the initial failure of Moby Dick, and reasons why the book found a new life in its representation of the American way of life. Finally, it described the work of a whaling ship as a factory, and in terms of costs and benefits.

3092616,1,B0012M1KWC,"Maybe I have been spoiled by the intense dedication to historical perfection evident in most all of the PBS segments dealing with American History, that this fiasco was such a disappointment.

A more appropriate title might have been The Housewives of Early American History. Much of the oratory by the narrator was modestly engaging, and most, (I stress most - not all), of the experts utilized to help tell this story were interesting. Any sense of historical credibility of this so-called documentary, was decimated by a feeble cast of actors and actresses, terms I use loosely, and was simply put - atrocious.

The storyline had moments of interest, but the bounding back and forth from an informative narrative, interspersed with a periodic opinion by an oft overly exuberant expert, were totally whitewashed by the simply absurd reenactments, punctuated by nauseating attempts at something called acting.

Nearly all the PBS productions I have had the pleasure of enjoying, have been truly delightful. Dolley Madison was not enjoyable, delightful, or tolerable until the final credits.",1404172800,,1091,5.294797687861272

This episode is really cringe worthy and makes one question the reasoning behind a procedure that is barbaric and heinous.  The willingness of people to do this to their loved ones was awe inspiring.  The Dr. who championed the procedure was a madman parading around in the guise of an altruistic healer.

This series includes some of the most controversial issues of the American Experience. I did view the entire series and still the three episodes listed remain as a reminder of how easily an event or events can go terribly wrong. Perhaps that is a lesson to be learned from history!
hs

Another interesting and informative series that is well presented and narrated. Recommended for those with a sense of curiosity and an interest in US history. There are those who frequently think that they know more than they do, this is a good reminder of what you just might not know!

The Lobotomist: To manage what was not completely understood is a grim reminder within the history of medicine. Carried to an extreme by a single man's obsession for curing the mentally ill, Dr. Walter Freeman almost defines the limits between physician and surgeon. Faced with the wretched situation of those committed to facilities for the mentally ill,  one can but wonder how he was affected by those circumstances. Lobotomy was not an unprecedented procedure and was included in medical literature, observed as the result of an accident or in other documents. The ocular technique required little expertise/training and offered a simple approach to the frontal lobe of the brain. This documentary presents multiple facets and it is graphic in the extreme.  Unfortunately, all mental diagnoses cannot be treated with a single procedure. With the advent of thorazine, the necessity for a frontal lobotomy became a nightmare from the past.
Exceptionally well presented and narrated with original footage and interviews. A lesson to be learned within the concept of modern medicine.

The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer: J. Robert Oppenheimer was beyond a doubt the essence of a genius. His understanding and moral attitude, his concern for the potential of atomic energy came at a great cost. His life was fraught with contradictions and an uncertainty about himself as an individual. He represented the higher moral ethic of the use of atomic/hydrogen energy as a weapon of mass destruction.
A most compelling documentary of power and knowledge, a recognition of the ultimate chaos these weapons would cause and a visionary of future events. A fascinating narration combined with interviews and original footage that give meaning to an earlier time and a simple question: What if? Don't miss this episode!

My Lai: My Lai is gruesomely accurate. How could this have happened? Any answer has to recognize the psychological effect of killing, being killed and more importantly the devastating horror of seeing one's comrades killed and militated.  Guilt can be collectively assigned or action taken to lessen the impact on individuals. War encourages the best and the worst within humankind. Listen very carefully and learn.

There are many lessons to be learned from history . . . recommended for original footage and the profiles that are portrayed!",1379289600,,3066,5.105788423153693
3092664,5,B0012M1KWC,"Sad story of generals in the high offices ordering mass bombings of Vietnam civilians with napalm and other nasty horrors, ignorant of the results, bomb a people so much and they become united.

3092676,4,B0012M1KWC,"I watched the polio crusade.  The last of the polio victims in the USA are dying out, being WWII era.

3327028,5,B0012M1KWC,"Who Knew that the breakthrough medical procedure of the late 1940's would be condemned as barbaric and ineffective within a decade?  This PBS documentary is mesmerizing in its telling of not only the treatment of mental illness but the famed treator.  Dr. Walter Freeman, at the time considered a pioneer and innovator in the treatment of mental illness, is believed to have been a man who truly wanted to help patients of this disease during a time when America's asylums could only house them in deplorable conditions with no hope for cure or release.

I really enjoyed how this documentary gave the history and circumstances that culminated in Dr. Freeman's decade of free reign to practice Prefrontal Orbital Lobotomy on mental patients with the blessings of the medical profession. His lobotomy procedure was hailed so convincingly as a cure-all by reputable medical organizations (Johns Hopkins) and print media that Joseph Kennedy, the millionaire father of future president John F. Kennedy, asked for and authorized Dr. Freeman to perform his groundbreaking procedure on daughter Rosemary Kennedy.  Rosemary would never be the same.

You have to see this documentary to feel in your bones the chilling effects of the instruments and procedure Dr. Freeman used.  A tool that looked like an icepick was inserted right above the eyeball under the eyelid near the upper nasal area.  A small mallet was used to strike the icepick forcing it through bone and wedging it into the frontal lobe of the brain.  The good doctor then moved the device left to right and up and down scrambling the membrane known as the Thalamus.  Mind you Dr. Freeman came up with this procedure as a cost-effective alternative to his drilling holes in patient's skulls and scooping at the Thalamus.  The procedure could be done in four minutes flat.

And take a guess at what pharmaceutical drug helped end the reign of Dr. Freeman's brain scrambling procedure?  Thorazine.  Thorazine was initially marketed as the ""chemical lobotomy.""

Dr. Freeman's commitment to his beliefs as well as his drive for historical fame most likely blinded him to the reality of lobotomy as a failure.  As for the American Medical profession, who at first backed then abandoned their support of Dr. Freeman, we as sufferers of all illnesses in America should be forewarned.  When hearing of new groundbreaking medical procedures and medicines today we should stop, get the facts and then question those pushing the newly discovered breakthrough on us. It just may be a faster, cheaper way to treat the poor or those without healthcare.  But the real question is does it work?  The Horror!",1292889600,,2648,5.034403669724771
3327029,4,B0012M1KWC,Very good short history of lobotomies.  It was rather short in length and left me wanting to learn more.  It is also pretty graphic and I had to look away at times.,1259971200,4,164,4.09375
3327030,5,B0012M1KWC,"American Experience: The Lobotomist tells the not so pretty story of the rise and fall of Dr. Walter Freeman and his surgical lobotomy procedure, a controversial treatment even when it was done in large numbers in an attempt to treat patients with chronic and severe forms of mental illness. This type of surgery took place, for the most part, back in the 1930s, 1940s and even the 1950s when psychiatric hospitals were little more than warehouses for people with mental illness; the best of the best simply had no idea how to treat them besides observation.

Enter Walter Freeman. The grandson of a doctor who was famous for the fist successful removal of a brain tumor on a living patient, Dr. Freeman wanted to prove himself a God. This wasn't all too hard at the time since doctors were generally regarded as Gods and almost nobody ever questioned their authority. In Dr. Freeman's time patients simply complied and there was no such thing as ""informed consent."" Freeman wanted solutions for chronic mental illness and he wanted them fast just as he also wanted fame and fortune for his efforts. He read so much that he finally discovered a crude form of lobotomy and after a few years of making this procedure a bit more sophisticated (not that it ever was an answer nor did it turn out to be sophisticated in any true way), lobotomies across the nation were occurring more and more frequently. Eventually thousands of people were having lobotomies and despite the fact that the results weren't really all that positive Dr. Freeman continued his surgery which was sometimes done outside a hospital in a most unprofessional way.

Even then, when some of his medical peers strongly disapproved of the procedure, Freeman was able to do lobotomies because at that time doctors simply didn't badmouth a peer in public and they had to admit they themselves lacked any other way to try to help very ill people. The story moves on from here to examine other angles of the story (I don't want to spoil it for you) and we see and learn in detail what eventually happened to Dr. Freeman and his now infamous lobotomy procedure.

The movie flows along well and the interviews with relatives, professionals and even one man who was lobotomized at the tender age of 12 really make this program on DVD fascinating. The archival footage is very well presented although some of it will be a bit tough to take for sensitive people.

In addition, the DVD comes without extras unless you count the referral to the PBS website for more information on this topic. I would have loved a few extras; but the film is so well done with its interviews that I can overlook this disappointment.

This film tells quite a story and I highly recommend it for students of psychology. People in any other field who interact with or treat mentally ill persons would do well to add this to their collections.",1257984000,20,2876,4.709741550695825

3327032,5,B0012M1KWC,"Until the 1930's,mentally ""unstable"" or ""depressed"" or ""insane"" people were often institutionalized,forgotten or considered an embarrassment to the family. Walter Freeman,the son of an American leading doctor,Dr. Keene, with much to prove and ambition for fame,began to ""rescue"" the mentally troubled by working on and seeking to perfect the bi-orbital frontal lobotomy- a technique whereby an simple ice pick is tapped into the frontal lobe of the brain and render the patient docile,relieved of all anxiety, thus ""cured"".The medical community and psychiatric community at first was skeptical,but within the shortest period of time began hailing Freeman.s lobotomy as standard medical procedure,so much so, that many unqualified people began to perform this simple five minute procedure!!!This ""cure"" would potentially end psychiatry (which carries it's own baggage) as we knew it.

If you want to watch this 60 minute special from PBS' 'American Experience"", your hair will stand on end and questions will be raised in your minds about how quickly people search for ""miracle cures"" and how haphazardly the revered medical community can toss aside all good and correct scientific practice in the light of continued evaluation over a period of time! People flocked in droves to have this procedure done. Families,burdened with a loved one who was mentally imbalanced made decisions under a doctor's advice to have the lobotomy done.

This documentary explores Walter Freeman,and at times villaifies and at times praises his work. This is how he was viewed by two camps in his lifetime. Was he a sane and rational scientist,or was he a egotistical maniac bent on fame?

I first became aware of lobotomy when as an 11 year old I was driven through a Mental Institution near Philadelphia where you could view lobotomy patients caged in yards in full view! This was legal in 1966! I have NEVER forgotten it. The next time lobotomy was presented to me was in the famous film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frances/dp/B00005OCK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frances</a>&nbsp;starring Jessica Lange (nominated for an Oscar) concerning the actress Frances Farmer who was forced against her will to be lobotomized. The other famous person that I recalled was Rosemary Kennedy,(yes of THE Kennedy's) who was lobotomized at 23 in order to avoid political scandal that might keep the Kennedy boys from being elected!(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kennedys-of-Massachusetts/dp/6303636365/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kennedys of Massachusetts</a>

In his 70's, Freeman,discredited and forced not to practice medicine by the very community that once hailed him as saviour,sought atonement or vindication by tracking down his thousands of patients seeking to verify that his work WAS scientifically successful. Crushed by his findings, he died a short while later in 1972.

I recently wanted to have lazer surgery performed on my eyes. My physician advised against it with one brief statement: ""There simply has not been enough time to evaluate scientifically if this procedure is a cure or if it will have serious repercussions down the road"".I respected his scientifically conservative opinion and still wear glasses and contacts!!
Thank God, also, that therapists are still around instead of lobotomy (although the postscript of this DVD states that lobotomies are still performed in ""most extreme cases""....now who decides that?)

Walter Freeman-villain or saint?...Oh did I forget that lobotomy was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize? Now reason that one out if you are in YOUR right mind! Did you take your VIOXX,CELEBREX or THORAZINE today?",1200960000,34,3706,5.716878402903811

It is an absolutely engaging feature film that not only brings together the major contributors to the creation of earth day, it presents the evolution of American environmental movement as the greatest contribution former hippies left for future generations.

Earth days is a 2009  documentary featured as an episode of American Episode that combines archival footage and interviews with notable environmental activists regard from about the 1950s to a little beyond the 1990s. Contrasting the related footage of politicians and newsreels are interviews with the Stewart Udall, Paul Ehrlich, Stewart Brand, Rusty Schweickart, and others about history and their contribution to environmentalism in America.  Its incredible history  using Rachel Carsons Silent Spring as a catalyst, most of the interviewee were inspired to create and mold the movement into a distinct political force that would culminate with the election and stutter badly with the election of Reagan in 1980. For most people, its difficult to imagine a time when America conducted nuclear test and factories routinely dumped unprocessed waste water to the point that a river caught fire.

I really enjoyed this particular episode.  In addition to content, the soundtrack continues the utilitarian classical SimCity-type that Robert Stone is known for.  There is one problem though  this movie only available in SD!  How can that be!?  PBS featured this in HD and SD on a 720p screen like mine looks terrible.

The video also spent time on Herman Melville, the initial failure of Moby Dick, and reasons why the book found a new life in its representation of the American way of life.

3327113,1,B0012M1KWC,"Maybe I have been spoiled by the intense dedication to historical perfection evident in most all of the PBS segments dealing with American History, that this fiasco was such a disappointment.

A more appropriate title might have been The Housewives of Early American History. Much of the oratory by the narrator was modestly engaging, and most, (I stress most - not all), of the experts utilized to help tell this story were interesting. Any sense of historical credibility of this so-called documentary, was decimated by a feeble cast of actors and actresses, terms I use loosely, and was simply put - atrocious.

The storyline had moments of interest, but the bounding back and forth from an informative narrative, interspersed with a periodic opinion by an oft overly exuberant expert, were totally whitewashed by the simply absurd reenactments, punctuated by nauseating attempts at something called acting.

Nearly all the PBS productions I have had the pleasure of enjoying, have been truly delightful. Dolley Madison was not enjoyable, delightful, or tolerable until the final credits.",1404172800,,1091,5.294797687861272

This episode is really cringe worthy and makes one question the reasoning behind a procedure that is barbaric and heinous.

This series includes some of the most controversial issues of the American Experience. I did view the entire series and still the three episodes listed remain as a reminder of how easily an event or events can go terribly wrong. Perhaps that is a lesson to be learned from history!
hs

Another interesting and informative series that is well presented and narrated. Recommended for those with a sense of curiosity and an interest in US history. There are those who frequently think that they know more than they do, this is a good reminder of what you just might not know!

The Lobotomist: To manage what was not completely understood is a grim reminder within the history of medicine. Carried to an extreme by a single man's obsession for curing the mentally ill, Dr. Walter Freeman almost defines the limits between physician and surgeon. Faced with the wretched situation of those committed to facilities for the mentally ill,  one can but wonder how he was affected by those circumstances. Lobotomy was not an unprecedented procedure and was included in medical literature, observed as the result of an accident or in other documents. The ocular technique required little expertise/training and offered a simple approach to the frontal lobe of the brain. This documentary presents multiple facets and it is graphic in the extreme.  Unfortunately, all mental diagnoses cannot be treated with a single procedure. With the advent of thorazine, the necessity for a frontal lobotomy became a nightmare from the past.
Exceptionally well presented and narrated with original footage and interviews. A lesson to be learned within the concept of modern medicine.

The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer: J. Robert Oppenheimer was beyond a doubt the essence of a genius. His understanding and moral attitude, his concern for the potential of atomic energy came at a great cost. His life was fraught with contradictions and an uncertainty about himself as an individual. He represented the higher moral ethic of the use of atomic/hydrogen energy as a weapon of mass destruction.
A most compelling documentary of power and knowledge, a recognition of the ultimate chaos these weapons would cause and a visionary of future events. A fascinating narration combined with interviews and original footage that give meaning to an earlier time and a simple question: What if? Don't miss this episode!

My Lai: My Lai is gruesomely accurate. How could this have happened? Any answer has to recognize the psychological effect of killing, being killed and more importantly the devastating horror of seeing one's comrades killed and militated.  Guilt can be collectively assigned or action taken to lessen the impact on individuals. War encourages the best and the worst within humankind. Listen very carefully and learn.

There are many lessons to be learned from history . . . recommended for original footage and the profiles that are portrayed!",1379289600,,3066,5.105788423153693
3327161,5,B0012M1KWC,"Sad story of generals in the high offices ordering mass bombings of Vietnam civilians with napalm and other nasty horrors, ignorant of the results, bomb a people so much and they become united. The dumb grunt then get nasty snipers, trust of villagers disappear and minds crack. Sad thing, seems the generals sons have become generals for the country again and repeat the fathers sins in Iraq, sad and frustrating, make you feel for the grunts.",1378080000,2,444,4.855263157894737
3327162,5,B0012M1KWC,We certainly can thank past generations for the magnificent footage or the time.  Seeing history can make reading about it so much more understanding.  Thank goodness American Experience put it together for us.,1375142400,,210,5.333333333333333

3327164,5,B0012M1KWC,"I thoroughly enjoyed American Experience and was impressed with it's detail and historical accuracy. One gets a true sense of what this country was truly like when America meant ""American"". I would recommend this series for viewers of all ages.",1370908800,,244,5.125
3327165,5,B0012M1KWC,After finishing the Dolley Madision episode I felt that I not only knew about Dolley Madision's background but also her huge impact on the Presidency of her husband as well as future generations of First Ladies. She defined the role and set high standards. Well done episode.,1370736000,,275,4.872340425531915

3327167,5,B0012M1KWC,"Great for showing what life as a typical combat G.I. in Vietnam might have been like.  As for the massacre, Charlie Company's story is definitely one of a kind and hopefully something which will never repeat itself in American history.  The interview with those involved are incredibly enlightening and emotional.  You can't help but think about the impact war has played on so many lives throughout history and the incredible stress it places on those who lived through it.  This documentary is very thought provoking from many aspects.",1368835200,,537,5.068181818181818

Don't get me wrong, the episode I watched was good, just not the same high production values and in depth information.  Still a decent series though!",1368144000,,243,4.902439024390244

I think I was on the tail end of the polio eradication, being vaccinated in the early 60's when it was finally declared eradicated.  A good representation of a historical time that current generations will soon be unaware of.  It is nice to relive history; it makes us so greatful for what we have.",1365465600,,401,4.378378378378378

3327176,5,B0012M1KWC,"The American Experience shows are fairly sedate. If you enjoy history presented in a way that's well researched and pretty thorough and that helps you understand significant people and events of the nation's past, you'll probably like this. If you like a lot of glitz and action and glamor and things blowing up, you may not. I thoroughly enjoyed all the segments shown as part of American Experience Volume 1, but I'm older and like history and don't watch movies like ""Transformers,"" so of course my assessment of this series reflects those values.",1361836800,,550,4.924731182795699

3327180,5,B0012M1KWC,"The episode on the history of New York City is outstanding and full of revelations for anyone in the country, not just in the city itself. For example, I did not know that Mayor LaGuardia spoke several languages and died leaving his widow only $8000 in war bonds and a heavily mortgaged house.
