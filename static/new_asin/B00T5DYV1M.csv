7000773,5,B00T5DYV1M,"""Chi's Sweet Home"" is a very peculiar title. Published in a manga magazine aimed at young men (seinen), Chi took everyone with surprise. Instead of hardcore nudity, violence and language, Chi gave us warmth, innocence and a very realistic view on how amazing everything is in the eyes of a cat and what they think at all times, in a classic ""Garfield""-style inner monologue.

This also works like an amazingly entertaining tutorial on how to raise a kitten. Each episode tackles issues like how to make a cat use their sandbox, how to cut their claws and what you should do to keep it safe. Also has a bunch of hilarious episodes where cat owners will feel right at home, like how hard it is to bath/shower a cat and the challenge of bringing it to the vet.

Each episode is only 3 minutes long, so they're fun and quick to watch. However, a few episodes have a recurring plot for 4-5 eps, but it works great and helps telling a more serious story. If you've read the manga, you'll recognize everything in the Anime as well. It's an (almost) identical adoptation of the comics.

The series became a hit in Japan quick, with both young and old fans, ranging from 3-99. This is a show for everyone, as long as you have a soft spot for cuteness. A veteran Anime viewer or just a fan of cute animation in general, give this one a try and join Chi on her sweet adventures.",1455062400,6,1367,4.395256916996048
