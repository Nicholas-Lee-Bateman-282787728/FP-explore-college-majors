5079598,5,B007EQQX04,This is a great DVD.  Looks into their lives from the early days up to the musical The Wall 2nd. stage show.  If your a Pink Floyd fan this is a great DVD.,1347753600,11,155,3.6666666666666665
5079599,3,B007EQQX04,"Lots of people trying far too hard to read hidden messages and complex ideas into what is essencially simple, though wonderfully beautiful music. Do yourself a favour and turn up the volume on your CD collection. You won't learn anything from this apart from the crap that self opinionated prats sounding far too pompous for their own good like to make themselves believe is in any way interesting or factual.",1344470400,12,409,4.857142857142857

5079609,5,B007EQQX04,"Great dvd! Really enjoyed it.. But for those of you interested in also purchasing ""What ever happened to Pink Floyd?"", don't bother, it is contained in this set along with the story of Meddle. Both have been repackaged and relabelled as disc 1 and disc 2. When you pay $20 each to buy them seperately, this set is great value at $15. Quality is exactly the same. Enjoy!",1360800000,28,369,4.4411764705882355

8515357,5,B007EQQX04,"A very good double set of Pink Floyd films which document the early years on the first disc and the later period on the second , the second film even covers the very recent collaborations between Roger Waters and Dave Gilmour that few if any fans thought they would ever see. Very special and rare footage is included throughout the set.,",1454112000,,338,4.557377049180328
