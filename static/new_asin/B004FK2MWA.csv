4368554,5,B004FK2MWA,"""Unstoppable"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A veteran engineer and a young conductor try frantically to stop a half-mile-long freight train carrying enough combustible liquids and poisonous gas to wipe out a nearby city.

The cast led by Denzel Washington (as Frank Barnes) & Chris Pine (as Will Coulson) is excellent! The directing by Tony Scott (also produced) (who also directed Denzel in ""Crimson Tide"" (1995), ""Man On Fire"" (2004), ""Deja Vu"" (2006) & ""The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3"" (2009) is excellent! The story & screenplay by Mark Bomback (who also did the story & screenplay to ""Godsend"" (2004, also co-produced), ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" (2007) & the screenplay to ""Race To Witch Mountain"" (2009) is excellent!

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who has been doing the music to Scott's films since ""Enemy Of The State"" (1998) is excellent! The cinematography by Ben Seresin (who also did the cinematography to ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"" (2009) & the upcoming ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011) is excellent! The film editing by Robert Duffy (who also did the film editing to ""The Cell"" (2000) & Chris Lebenzon (who is doing the film editing to the upcoming ""Frankenweenie"" (2012), he also did the film editing to Scott's ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" (1987), ""Revenge"" (1990), ""Days Of Thunder"" (1990), ""Crimson Tide"", ""Enemy Of The State"", ""Deja Vu"" & ""The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3"") is excellent!

This is an excellent movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. Denzel Washington & Tony Scott have made another excellent film together. This is one of their best films, if not, the best film, together. This is one of the best action films of the year and one of the best films of the holiday season, thus far.",1289606400,2,3470,4.969018932874355
4368555,4,B004FK2MWA,"Normally, I can barely tolerate Tony Scott's frantic, even frenzied, directing style.  He's all about fast cuts, swooping angles and cursory character development.  He's often a bit like Michael Bay, with at least with a better visual sense.  His films often indicate changes in time or mood through a change in color saturation.  You CANNOT see one of his films and not constantly be reminded that you're watching a movie.  Films like MAN ON FIRE and TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 give me a headache.

UNSTOPPABLE is a film that finally has Scott back on track (pun intended).  His directing style hasn't changed...heck, it even stars his constant collaborator Denzel Washington.  But the story matches his style.  A runaway train, however scary such a thing might be, can pretty much only go straight and predictably...but Scott's over-baked sound mix, crazy editing and challenging camera angles make this hurtling train feel like a living monster.

The story is set in Pennsylvania.  At one end of the state, a bunch of useless railyard workers, through a series of bad choices, send a train pulling a large load of toxic chemicals on its way with the throttle down and no one on board.  Coming in the other direction are various obstacles...and another freight train carrying experienced railman Denzel and rookie conductor Chris Pine (from the recent STAR TREK).  Eventually, these two guys find themselves needing make some difficult choices in order to try to stop this crazy train from killing thousands of people.  That's really about all the film is about...yet it is very gripping.

We learn (or feel like we're learning) a lot about the workings of trains and rail systems.  Rosario Dawson, in a thankless role, is the person in the control booth with all the lights and microphones and computers around her (you know, sort of like the room Washington sat in for most of TAKING OF PELHAM...).  Her job is to spout statistics and physics, and to get into ridiculous yelling matches with the corporate suits, who can't make a single reasonable decision.  It's one thing to try to cast scorn on corporate types...it's another to make them behave about as brightly as a teenager in a slasher movie.

But the movie rests very comfortably on the shoulders of Washington and Pine.  Washington is in coasting mode, relying primarily on his still considerable charisma.  But he's smart and funny, and is simply a professional doing a great job of playing another professional in another profession.  But best of all is Pine.  I liked him a lot in STAR TREK (as Captain Kirk), but I worried that he was getting by on good looks and a smart mouth, coupled with a spectacle of a movie.  But here, he's still ""hunky"", but he feels blue collar and convincing.  When called upon to act bravely, he doesn't come off as a hero, but as a guy making tough choices in order to protect loved ones.  The two men have good chemistry...there's a little bit of the ""old timer giving the new kid a hard time"" banter...but less than I would have expected.  I wouldn't say their scenes are particularly well-written; they simply do a nice job with what they've got.

Meanwhile, the two trains hurtle, helicopters fly, mishaps and crashes occur all leading up to a remarkably tense and exciting final 15 minutes.  UNSTOPPABLE is not a classic action film...but it is a very worthy effort and it made for an excellent evening at the movies.  I also liked that it is a comfortable PG-13...there was plenty of noise and crashing, but no gratuitous death and gore.  It was a good blue collar film about some great blue collar guys.",1289606400,3,3604,4.773828756058158
4368556,5,B004FK2MWA,"Great CAST, they compliment each other, and keep you focused on the show, can't wait for the Blue Ray or DVD to hit the stores !!",1289520000,,129,4.0
4368557,3,B004FK2MWA,"Remember Speed from 1994? It was that action film that everyone seemed to love during the nineties and for good reason; it had high octane action, a great cast, and it managed to just keep going even when you thought it was going to end like ten minutes prior. Now get rid of the bus and replace it with an out of control train carrying explosive chemicals. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are now Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, which means Joe Morton is now Rosario Dawson and Dennis Hopper is Kevin Dunn...or something. Anyway, the point is, Unstoppable in a nutshell is basically Speed on a train.

The first thing that comes to mind with Unstoppable is how incredibly LOUD it is. It seemed like the knob to the volume was broken off after it was turned past its limitations during the sound editing process. If you aren't listening to an out of control train squealing on railroad tracks, it's the soundtrack full of heavy guitar riffs that rumbles the floor under your seat. The other kind of bizarre thing was the weird zoom-in Unstoppable used in the first half of the film. We'd open on a shot of actors talking, but then the camera would zoom-in slightly sometimes more than once. It was probably used to try and add suspense to whatever the actors were talking about at the time, but it came off as irritating more than anything. Thankfully, it wasn't done the entire film. I seem to remember it happening during another recent film that I can't put my finger on, but it's more than likely another Tony Scott film.

In a film like this, acting is kind of secondary. As long as they're reacting to whatever threat is currently posed against them in a way that seems realistic, then it's safe to say that they've done their job well. This isn't the best work of any of the actors involved. Denzel Washington definitely shined brighter in both Man on Fire (another Tony Scott film) and The Book of Eli from earlier this year and Chris Pine hasn't really done anything as impressive as his portrayal of Captain James Kirk in last year's Star Trek. Then there's Rosario Dawson whose role as Connie seems kind of safe for the actress as it seems way too similiar to most of the other roles in her repertoire. The thing is though that it all works out in the end to deliver a film that is both thrilling and exciting. People go to the movies to be entertained and this film does that very well. The one problem with Unstoppable is that it doesn't seem to give any weight to the several emotional factors of the film. We know just enough to realize both Frank and Will will lose a lot if they fail at trying to stop this train and while it does work, I can't help but feel like the film would have had an even bigger impact if we had spent a little more time getting to know Frank's daughters or having a little more depth to Will's situation with his wife and son.

Unstoppable is a white knuckled, edge of your seat thriller that has a way of making you feel like you're thrown in front of the railroad tracks as this unstoppable train approaches during the most suspenseful and knuckle biting scenes. The thriller is very similar to what Speed would be like today if it took place on a train, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unstoppable is definitely an exciting way to waste an hour and a half.",1289520000,11,3311,4.451400329489291
4368558,4,B004FK2MWA,"UNSTOPPABLE

STARRING: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn, T.J. Miller, Ethan Suplee and Kevinn Corrigan

WRITTEN BY: Mark Bomback

DIRECTED BY: Tony Scott

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Action / Thriller
Release Date: 12 November 2010
Review Date: 09 November 2010

Unstoppable is the perfect title for a Denzel Washington flick because that is exactly what he is. He simply doesn't make bad movies and his performances are always riveting and dead-on. And if you were to surround him with the talents of Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson, you really couldn't go wrong.

Director Tony Scott has done just that with Unstoppable, marking it as his impressive 16th feature film and fifth collaboration with Denzel. From Top Gun and Days of Thunder to Beverly Hills Cop II and The Taking of Pelham 123, who better to direct an action picture based on true events of a runaway train carrying tons of deadly chemicals, than Tony Scott?

That's the plot and you know the actors so let's meet the characters. Denzel plays Frank; a single father to two teenage daughters working their way through college by waiting tables at Hooters. Don't trouble yourself; Denzel makes the joke for you. I'm just curious if Hooters paid Fox or if Fox paid Hooters? Frank has been working in a rail yard for 28 years and today he's got a new partner.

Chris Pine plays Will - said partner, and the two don't hit it off so well at first. Frank is old school and Will is new school and there's no teacher around to make sure they play nice. It's just them and us in the cockpit of their train for the majority of their screen time. Don't think we spend the entire film stuck in a conductor box with these two though because we don't; they're not on the runaway train by the way.

The train has runaway (is it just me or does the term runaway train just sound funny?) due to the incompetence of two idiots played by two funny and good actors whom I'll save for you. Their boss Connie, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, must clean up their mess, serving as mediator between them, other employees, Frank and Will, an inspector, and her stiff corporate A-hole of a supervisor, Galvin (Kevin Dunn).

Galvin is more concerned with the potential financial tragedy of a `train wreck' as the beast is half a mile long (a lot of money folks), than he is with the moral dilemma of how many lives will be lost should a wreck occur. The train has to go somewhere and it's headed straight for a big town; of course. Frank, Will and Connie aren't having it though because they're the good guys after all; so they devise a plan to earn that title.

Unstoppable is about a train on the loose - but it's good, fast, funny and fun.",1289347200,5,2701,4.525667351129363

4368671,3,B004FK2MWA,"I'm a train fan, and a film maker, so keep that in mind with my review.

I recently found out about this movie by accident and since I love movies and trains, I had to buy it. I hadn't seen any previews for it or read reviews on it. I like watching movies as untainted as possible.

With a $100 MILLION dollar budget and a good film crew this COULD have been a great movie. Instead I was disappointed with many things.

There are so many aspects of this film that have been ripped off from another ""Runaway"" train movie called Atomic Train released in 1999. It's more than a coincidence that Unstoppable also has an OLD engineer, young conductor, Hazardous cargo, Helicopters,  LIVE News coverage of the event that the kids are watching of the HEROES. A black, female Dispatcher, both train crews get injured, one crushes his hand, the other his foot. It's almost like the writer just took the script from Atomic Train made a few changes and spewed it back out.

My biggest complaint is for the director who should have provided FREE Dramamine with every movie ticket and DVD purchase.
The long zooms and high shutter speeds to try and make the train look FAST along with the constant non-stop dolly movies back and forth, left to right, and zoom snaps during the entire film makes this movie one of the most unpleasing and nauseating I've ever watched.

Yes, there is a time and place for fast camera moves, snap zooms, and high shutter speeds, but NOT for the entire film! They were over compensating where it wasn't needed.
While they prided themselves on shooting the film PRACTICALLY with very limited CG, even going as far as to derail a real train engine, they inserted some really poorly done and unreal CG that just killed what they were trying to accomplish.

Color grading was bad. Too dark, inconstant, and didn't lend anything to the film.

I was amazed at how bad they messed this film up given their budget and amount of resources they had. I blame the director. An old guy who was past his prime and just wanted to play with some toy's one last time before he retired.

Next comes the really bad LIVE NEWS coverage, the hand holding, and some poor editing choices of dialog during scenes.
Example, Engineer's young daughters working at HOOTERS watching the LIVE news coverage yelling GO DAD! while he makes his way across a speeding train.

So many things were WRONG with this movie for the amount of talent and MONEY they threw at it.
I only wish I had Directed it and actually created a decent train movie.

As I said, I LOVE TRAINS! I'm a huge railroad fan as well as working in the Film industry. This movie should have been my perfect match. But sadly, it derailed FAST.",1483747200,,2691,4.527835051546392

4368769,4,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable is an American action thriller produced in 2010 and directed by Tony Scott and starring Chris pine as Will Colson and Denzel Washington as Frank Barnes. It is about a story on a runaway train that is unable to stop no matter the spirited effort put by the two aforementioned men to stop it. However, Colson and Barness efforts come to yield fruit as the duo finally manages to stop the train after a long struggle. In the movie, Scott manages to demonstrate how dangerous the monstrous trains are. One is able to see how disastrous these trains would be even before the disaster itself happens. For instance, the train had shipment of toxic chemicals headed straight towards children, schools, animals among other things. The school excursion train narrowly escapes a head on collision with the runaway train. Two of the trains tank cars contain molten phenol that is a dangerous hazardous material when blown up hence Connies panic as she seeks police help in manning the railway crossing. The locomotive brakes failed to function following a mistake done by Dewey, one of the holsters to connect the air hose before parking the train on the track even after being reminded by his partner.
Scott utilizes suspense from start to the end of the movie as no one can predict the outcome thereby making the movie very interesting to watch. The train is traveling at a speed of about 76km/k for more than two hours and the attempts to derail it fails. The police on the other hand hit the fuel cab instead of shooting the fuel releasing valve therefore unable to stop the train. These in addition to the inexperience of Colson as a conductor as well as the mistakes done by the holsters further diminishes viewers hopes on the possible success by the concerned parties to stop the monstrous train. However, this is finally achieved as the second train is coupled with locomotive and the crew manages to shut down the train having slowed down. Consequently, a looming disaster is avoided in the densely populated area.",1466121600,,2024,4.802292263610315

I miss Tony Scott, he gave us some of the best films ever. Movies like Top Gun, True Romance the Denzel flicks like this one as well as many more. Of course it was Denzel who became his actor, every director has one. Whether they work with them on every film, most films or just a few films everyone has that actor that they just have that chemistry with. Denzel was that for Scott and this was their final film together and second in a row involving a train.

The story follows two train conductors who have to stop a runaway train that is carrying some very dangerous cargo. One is the experienced veteran who is losing his job while the other is the new guy who is replacing him. Them must come together to stop this train and stop what could become a huge disaster. What makes it even better is that it is based on an actual event called the CSX 8888 Incident in 2001.

Scotts final film is one of his best a good one to go out on. Not only is it inspired by a real event but it was a fun flick that also starred his actor, Denzel Washington. Scotts style of filmmaking was perfect for this story that was written by Mark Bomback who has written other action flicks like Live Free or Die hard, the Total Recall remake, The Wolverine and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes among others. Of course you know Denzel was excellent here as he always is. Chris Pine was great as well here as was the rest of cast.

You get some behind the scenes making of features along with some commentaries which you know I loved on the DVD. It was great hearing Tony here talking about the film. I will miss Tony and any future films he would have made. I recommend this film to anybody out there who enjoyed Scotts films or films like this.",1462492800,,1735,4.216867469879518

Due to human error 'train 777' becomes a runaway, it's hauling several carriages. many holding highly volatile cargo, if the train cannot be stopped or and slowed down before it reaches the severe bend in the track at 'Stanton' many lives could be lost.
the film will draw you on board with the chase to catch '777' and the tension will engulf you, you'll not take your eyes off the screen.
'Denzel Washington' rarely makes a bad movie, this does not buck the trend it's an exciting watch.

4368862,4,B004FK2MWA,"Released in 2010, Unstoppable is about a runaway train in Pennsylvania carrying toxic chemicals and the engineer and conductor who try to stop it (Denzel Washington & Chris Pine). Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.

The movies based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Dont read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.

While the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple yeah, right action scenes (not that theres anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesnt overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.

The film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: Youll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESNT become ground chuck.

BOTTOM LINE: Unstoppable is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985s Runaway Train, it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that its based on a true incident.

The old guy is being pushed out so the sleazy railroad company doesn't have to pay his benefits.  The young guy has to prove himself because he got his job through family connections.  A fat lazy moron didn't do whatever it was he was supposed to do and now a half mile train laden with chemicals is about to lay waste to a large part of Pennsylvania.  The sleazy railroad company's president is more interested in his game of golf and the company's share price than what might happen to the Keystone State and a car load of kids on a class trip. Luckily there is a wise government official and a determined woman of color so all the fat dumb white guys can't just go back to the country club, loosen up the khakis, hoist another gin and tonic and forget about those poor school children.

4368905,4,B004FK2MWA,"Several genres come together here. There's ""the machine must be stopped"" genre.  Then there's the ""Young Guy has to win Respect of Grizzled Veteran.""  When respect has been won, we're in a ""Buddy movie.""  And underpinning the whole set up, there's the ""hardworking guys on the front line actually know better than the bosses"" story.  It's a good stew, and it has a nice old fashioned feel to it, because the machine isn't HAL or a NORAD computer counting down to World War 3 -- it's a runaway train that tops out about 75 miles an hour, and that's plenty, when it's headed for a tight bend in Stanton PA, with a lot of freight cars, four or five of which contain a highly combustible and toxic compound that could probably wipe out Stanton.  The grizzled veteran -- 28 years working for the railroad as an engineer -- is Denzel Washington; the kid is four months out of his training and a relative of the owners to boot: Chris Pine, a. k. a. James T. Kirk.  The wrinkle is that they are working a second train that they decide to use to stop the runaway -- but How???!!!  Throw in another railroad vet in a beat-up red pickup (Lew Temple) and all the pieces are in place -- or almost: there is a nice woman in middle-management (Rosario Dawson) who decides to trust the working stiffs and defy the boss (who wants to derail the train in a small town where the collateral damage will be relatively limited) and who keeps in radio contact with them during their efforts.

The train -- both trains actually -- are great to look at, and, of course, the media is all over the story: lots of shots of TV coverage (watched, of course, by the loved ones of Denzel and Chris).  The TV coverage is well-used to keep the viewer oriented on matters like how close the train is getting to major population centers as well as on some of the finer points of railroad work.  It's great fun . . . and did I mention -- there's a third train on the track, full of school kids on their way to a field trip to learn about railroad safety . . .",1438041600,,2022,4.2973684210526315

I never run my trains (or have seen anyone else run trains) like that. Ever. Anyway, pretty good entertainment movie otherwise. The joke about the daycare and retirement home killed me for about 5 minutes because it is SO incredibly true! I just have a feeling I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't in that particular profession. Just FYI, railroads absolutely DO NOT run like this anymore. The alerter systems are incredibly effective now and throttles don't just accelerate to notch 8 like that. There's actually quite a bit of resistance.

It was well acted, directed and it had me totally spellbound.  I was raised in a village that is only on the map because of the trains that ran through our little berg!  We had a round house and switch tracks down under the viaduct.  ""Unstoppable"" brought me right back to the days when we could hear the trainmen calling to each other down at the train yard on a warm summer night.  I still love the sound of trains.  This movie gave me an entirely new respect for those who take on the responsibility of coordinating and running such a huge part of how we move people and goods across the USA!  They are on duty 24/7 during times of peace or war.  Railways are an incredible part of our countries infrastructure!  I appreciate them more now than ever.

First Crimson Tide , later Man On Fire and so on . Tony having directed the ultra cool vampire feature The Hunger (back in the day) with David Bowie and those oh , so lovely ladies .
That brings us to this . If you enjoy the people involved , don't mind suspending your possibly myriad questions and invite the film to wash over you (as myself)  I'd wager you're gonna have a pretty thrilling time . Pretty darn thrilling indeed .
Then check out Denzel in The Equalizer , if inclined , for a grand Washington double feature . He's one-of-the-best (Chris Pine is no slouch either).....Benstarbuck",1422144000,,753,4.4963503649635035

If you were feeling cynical then you could just tally up all of the standard action movie tick boxes; they're all there - experienced old-timer, new recruit, corporate bean-counters, broken marriages, police cars crashing, stuff going bang and, of course, a huge train. It is, however, totally impossible to not enjoy this film. The cast are superb, the pace is absolutely relentless, the tension builds steadily to an almost unsustainable level and, despite an utterly predictable ending all you can say as the credits roll is `Wow, what a fantastic film'.",1421280000,,932,5.261744966442953

A bit unrealistic in some aspects and of course the true events that inspired the film were far less dramatic albeit not too dissimilar in the story's ultimate resolution.  Denzel Washington did seem a bit like he just showed up for a check where everyone else really put forth their dramatic best.  Many characters were underutilized and the motivations of some where not fully realized.  Those than know at least a little about how the rail industry works may be a bit put off by some of the unrealistic events in the film and the anti-corporate message put forth was a little jarring and heavy handed; however, it is a good film and I recommend all that like action to watch it.",1415923200,2,725,4.46969696969697

4369201,4,B004FK2MWA,"Any story that revolves around the issue of a runaway train definitely makes for one of those ever-so-predictable cycles where you have the rapidly-rising tension in a race against time, the climax where the worst is over and finally the point at which the heroes are praised. I will agree that this movie is far from the best of its kind, but considering the incredibly low standards of a number of action/adventure films nowadays, I would have to say that this is definitely a standout gem for the times.

We have a runaway train that is described as ""a missile the size of the Chrysler Building"" that is carrying tons of toxic chemicals that would prove catastrophic if the train goes over a curve adjacent to a bridge at too high of a speed, and it must be stopped. After a front-end intercept by a pair of locomotives leaves a veteran engineer dead, and a de-railing device proves to be a miserable failure, it is up to two men, a rookie and an experienced professional, to bring this speeding metal giant to a halt. After much of a struggle, the pair finally succeed in their mission, and the monstrous train is brought to its knees.

In a general sense, despite what some critics might like to say to bash the ""predictability"" and ""unoriginality"" of the plot and outcome of this movie, I think that anyone who likes dramatic adventure films can really enjoy it for what it is. I definitely give it a solid recommendation for action/adventure movie lovers to add it to their collection.",1408233600,3,1492,4.626415094339623

The first time was about 15 minutes into the movie. The automatic air brakes would have deployed as soon as the line was broke. Oooops! The engine shifted itself into gear?! The dead man controls would have killed the engine. The two engines deployed to get ahead of the train and slow it down had platforms and railings allowing for easy access from one to the other. My favorite part of this was all of the hazardous materials stored right at the worst possible location where an inevitable derailment would cause the worst kind of disaster.

I enjoy both Chris Pine and Denzel Washington in this move very much although neither one are must see actors for me. Denzel Washington has a nice laid back presence in the film that notches down his usual intensity so that he really feels like the 'regular guy' he's portraying. He and Chris Pine play off each nicely, the wise old guy and the brash new guy. I love Rosario Dawson in this as well, and when she says ""I like them"" , that line coming from that character is high praise for anyone. In fact everyone in the film seems like a 'real' person and it's not just the style in which it was filmed, I think the director also must have encouraged this in his actors, everything seems very 'natural' in such an unnatural situation. Sure it's basically a 'disaster film' but a very stylish one with a lot of well paced action and likeable characters or at least, realistic characters. I recommend it.",1405382400,2,993,4.372972972972973

4369309,5,B004FK2MWA,There hasn't been a movie I enjoyed like Unstoppable since Speed with Keanu Reeves. What unquestionably gives this movie more clout is the fact that it was based on an actual incident. Yes there's dramatic license involved but that's true of just about any movie adaption(Black Hawk Down anyone). There's a brilliance and a steadiness to Chris Pine in this movie that more than accurately balances out the surefooted nature of regular favorite Denzel Washington. Rosario Dawson & Kevin Dunn also bring credibility to this story that grasps you by the throat and never lets go.,1401062400,,576,5.010416666666667

Having said that, I did make it through and totally identified with the two main characters. I was on the edge of my seat and happy to say it was from a movie where the culprit was human error, rather than evil people. Having a movie with no one shooting or trying to kill anyone was rather refreshing, even though it was not without it's uncaring jerks, something true to life indeed. Exciting movie that I would like to watch with my grandkids, but again, the language in it would prevent that.",1400630400,,664,4.4958677685950414
4369311,4,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable is action packed but suffers from Hollywood formula approach. The formula approach detracts from the story telling. The result is a predictable disaster story with archetypical bosses fouling things up and everyday workers end up saving the day.  It is a good train story and rail fans will like it for that. Movie goers will appreciate Denzel Washington in a potentially magnificent role, as an underplayed pro who knows his job as engineer. The glue that holds this film together is the train itself filled out with bits of Washington who doesn't get enough screen time. Chris Pine gets the air time but with a poorly written character, can't hold your interest. A great supporting cast is out for lunch most of the time. The real star is the runaway train. Had the producers known much about trains and focused on Washington's character, we'd have had a more dramatic story in play. Hollywood ends up tripping over themselves as if they'd tied their shoes tougher. I wanted to see more of Denzel Washington's character and less of Chris Pine's.  Rosario Dawson can do more than carry donuts into the office. And Lew Temple and Kevin Corrigan could have added so much more than eat breakfast at a diner and be nuisance in the office. Still, Train enthusiasts will probably score the film much lower but will want to see this film for it's behind the scenes view into train operations.

The combination of Chris Pine and Denzel Washington provide some great character moments and the yard master played by Rosario Dawson is also a well played character. There's a lot of great suspense in this movie and it shows how two ordinary guys who would usually be at eachother's throats most of the time can change into partners in the face of adversity. Definitely recommended as long as you can look past the few physics quirks that occur, but those appear in most movies anyway. Enjoyable.",1389139200,2,625,4.6909090909090905

He really raved about it. I decided then and there to watch it. It was incredibly good; very dramatic, fast paced,and a serious nail biter. I'm lucky I still have my fingernails. Both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine were superb as they tried to stop the unstoppable train. The story line is very good also and strong. I'm planning to purchase several copies of it to give as Christmas gifts to some of my family members.

Next you have all these so called experts trying to figure out how to stop the train  none of it made sense  to me like trying to shot the control box on side of the train  they could have had a sharp shooter from the helicopter take aim at it for umpteen miles this locomotive was going and would have had a better chance at it. Then you had the bosses trying to figure how much it was going to cost them in money if they derailed it.  Next you had hundreds of people standing next to tracks watching this train go by  how stupid was that ? I guess make movie now days  & hope it makes money.,1388620800,,756,3.9536423841059603

4369425,5,B004FK2MWA,"This has to be the best train movie that has come along since ""Runaway Train"" starring Jon Voight and others.  O.K. there was another great train movie starring Burt Lancaster, but this movie allowed the viewer to see what can happen when mistakes are made, almost from the beginning. Suspense surmounts every scene, a viewer might not want to take their eyes off the screen for a moment and might find themselves on the edge of their seats while watching. The chemistry between movie legend Denzel Washington and new comer, Chris Pine.  Washington as an experienced Trainman and Pine as a newbie, not too much experience but he claims he knows what to do.  Well, as I said, together Washington and Pine demonstrate what great teamwork can do.  This story is based on a true events, we all know what a train wreck looks like, thanks to the media, and here you have two men who risk their lives to save thousands, possibly more, citizens.  The Company who run the train are more concerned about damage to their Diesel Engine and the Companies stock, than the lives of innocent citizens.",1387929600,,1085,4.689473684210526

4369527,1,B004FK2MWA,"This is a personal quirk of mine but if a cinematic technique is used repeatedly to the point of annoyance, it dilutes the enjoyment factor.

The first technique is color filter overuse, which I first noticed in Man On Fire and had that same yellowish tint.  This can be overlooked and just accepted. What made this movie totally annoying to the point of anger was that every shot during the action sequences was handheld and all over the place.  A car gets crashed into and it's hard to see because the camera is purposely shakey (to make things look raw and real, perhaps?).  But even that I've seen in other movies before.

But what I found particularly aggravating was that almost every other shot, no matter what the duration, had an unnecessary quick zoom in or quick zoom out or both.  It became such a distraction and annoyance that it took me totally out of the movie to the point where I was verbally tallying each one.  I'd seen quick zooms in the Death Race and Get Carter remakes (on the drivers in the cars) that looked ridiculous. In Unstoppable, it was all over the place.  If there was a reason for it, that's something else entirely.  But in this movie, there were zooms for absolutely no reason other than the director and director of photography wanted to establish a look and a feel.  To this particular viewer, that feeling was annoyance and anger.

Anyway, I found the technique so distracting that it killed any enjoyment.  Minus these techniques, I would probably give this movie three stars because it is a decent action movie if one doesn't dissect implausabilities in the plot.  Movies featuring juggernauts are always impressive.

But to those who think I'm off the mark, the next time you watch Unstoppable, verbally mark each time there is a short zoom in/out and I guarantee you will be surprised how many there are.  Obviously those who didn't notice had gotten so caught up in the story.  I guarantee that once you consciously call out the first three examples (which could well be seen in a span of ten seconds or less), you'll notice its abuse throughout the movie.",1372809600,7,2101,4.6531165311653115

4369537,4,B004FK2MWA,"Not to be confused with Unstoppable (2004), which starred Wesley Snipes, with a completely different screenplay having nothing to do with trains.
Of course,  Denzel Washington is just fine as the Old Vet who has 30 days to go before he goes on forced retirement with half the expected pension. Chris Pine, whom I do not know, handles well what is required of the rookie working with  Washington.  Assorted other players are quite competent in support. A simple story, many times filmed. Runaway train with a lethal cargo. Washington and Pine, on another train,  are the last resort if a violent explosion of a highly combustible cargo in a populated area, is to be avoided. With the exception of some minor personal problems each faces, the plot and the Director have chosen to go straight down the line with nothing going on but the runaway train, the train on which Washington and Pine are, and the axis including local and higher administrative decision-makers. For very good reasons, since The Great Train Robbery,  railroads have been the setting for many fine and not-at-all fine films; there is that notion of speed, isolation from the surrounding countryside, and being in a world of its own, that puts us in the mood for romance, adventure and thrills. While the first is absent here (save for off-the-train brief shots ) the other two are present in spades.
A good picture for the family, there are only one or two mild expletives which might disturb even the most fastidious parents, I can recommend this to any potential viewer regardless of what their favorite genre is.",1370908800,2,1583,4.848148148148148
4369538,2,B004FK2MWA,"Much as I love Denzel Washington as an actor, he really jumped the shark in ""Unstoppable"".  He got outacted by Rosario Dawson (as a determined rail yard manager), Chris Pine (as a rookie engineer), and a runaway train.  The Denzel Washington here is essentially channeling the same roles that he played in movies like ""The Book of Eli"" and ""Man on Fire"" - calm, cool, aloof, taking the necessary actions only when he has to.  And in ""Unstoppable"", it comes off very dull, like you've seen it already and better, by him and some other good actors.  Dawson, Pine, and the train bail him out of this flick.

The story, in and of itself, is compelling - a freight train is accidentally throttled to power in a rail yard and, without active air brakes to stop it, takes off down the line.  It's up to Pine, the rookie, and Washington, the old vet who found out not long before that day that the railroad was displacing him, to stop it before it reaches the city of Arklow, Pennsylvania (which, with over 700,000 people would be more populous than the state's real-life second city, Pittsburgh) and a sharp curve which sits near a Family Dollar and some fuel tanks that will undoubtably explode should the train run off the tracks and fall into them.  The execution, however, was lacking. The musical score constantly droned away while the action was taking place, not letting up a bit where it should've been much less ham-handed, and helicopters galore were giving chase at ridiculously low altitudes in order to get a good story.

""Unstoppable"" is not a movie on the order of some other notable train movies, like ""The Cassandra Crossing"" or ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" (the Walter Matthau/Robert Shaw version).  Heck, it doesn't even have the camp value of the made-for-TV disaster drama ""Atomic Train"".  And it could've been much better than it was.  This is a good movie to while away the afternoon when there's nothing else to do, or for those who are hard-core into disaster films.",1370908800,,1992,4.679083094555874

4369543,4,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable(released Nov/10)stars,among others,Denzel Washington as Frank Barnes,Chris Pine as Will Colson,and Rosario Dawson as Connie Hooper. This film is a film that grabs you almost right from the beginning and never lets go to the last nail biting moment.
The story introduces us to two people. First enters Pine whose wife has a restraining order out on him as he is walking into his first day on the job at the train yard. Next is Denzel who has 28 years under his belt,but is getting short pensioned after 28 years. He and his colleagues are less than cordial to Pine who blame he and his ilk for their  fall in fortunes. Denzel is partnered with Pine who is conducting the train. They take an engine out to retrieve a train load of zinc and return it to the yard.
Meanwhile in the yard circumstances are set into motion which will change many lives. A lazy train worker gets sloppy,jumps off a slow moving train to change a switch,but the controls he left in place slip and change,setting the locomotive off on its own. It picks up speed and is bound eventually for the highly populated city of Scranton,Pa. Back down the same line the train is headed toward is Denzel and Pine. Frantic efforts and ideas to stop the train from the yard master and her underlings meet with no success. A later effort to derail the train purposely also is going to fail,but Denzel and Pine decide to race in reverse after the train in an attempt to hook up to it and slow it down. This they manage to do but it isn't enough. Pine gets injured in the attempt and Denzel decides to go topside of the runaway train cars and manually hit each ones brakes. This does the trick and the train manages to make it through a bad curve in Scranton.
Their engine's brakes have failed and the runaway is picking up speed again. Denzel is stuck and can't get over a car loaded with pipes. A fast moving pick up truck of an employee who has been following them comes by and picks up Pine. He races him to the front of the train and Pine just manages to grab on the rail,get aboard and finally stop the train.
The film ends as both men are being celebrated. Pine has gotten back together with his wife and Denzel has had his pension and job reinstated.
Once the introductions are over and the train is in runaway mode,the film's tension just never lets up. The late director Scott did a bang up job here,and the actors manage to convey their characters as just two ordinary guys caught up in circumstances beyond their control. The action on and around both trains is spectacular as police cordone off roads,helicopters fly in pursuit and tensions amongst the railroad brass build to a crescendo.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,featurettes and deleted scenes.
All in all one movie full of tension and action. The actors do a spot on job with their characters and director Scott did a great job throughout. This was Scott's second to last film. Recommended.",1369612800,,3008,4.539594843462247

4369547,4,B004FK2MWA,"You may not realize it when you watch Unstoppable for the first time, but nearly every shot of trains and helicopters and various other vehicles was made using real trains, helicopters, cars, etc.  Late director Tony Scott (Top Gun) barely utilizes CGI in staging the chaotic action that unfolds in this true life inspired runaway train thriller, and it is truly refreshing to see an action movie that gets by using practical effects, using CGI only when he couldn't safely create the onscreen action with real vehicles.  Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are both pretty good in their roles.  This movie is far from being deep, but is an enjoyable escape.",1369353600,,655,4.882882882882883

4369552,4,B004FK2MWA,"Just starting his job at a Pennsylvania railroad company Will (Chris Pine, ""Star Trek"") is met with the usual cold shoulder treatment from a lot of the veterans that have been with the company for years. He is paired with a veteran engineer named Frank (Denzel Washington, ""The Book of Eli"") to learn the ropes, the ins and outs of how to be an expert train conductor, it starts as a routine first day at a new job. However after two other conductors ""somehow"" lose their train (spoiler alert, pretty dumb on their part how they manage to lose it), Will and Frank are told to intercept this runaway train and stop it from speeding through, rolling off the tracks and wrecking a populated town in Penn.

Oh did I forget to mention this runaway train is carrying a ton of dangerous chemicals? Cause that's kinda important. Once Will and Frank are told to find this train it becomes a race against the clock and also there's some people at the train center to advance the movie, the usual person who wants to just knock the train off the tracks no matter the damage to any nearby countryside, the one person whose on Frank and Will's side and a few other bit characters thrown in. Where this movie really shines is the pursuit and eventual catching up to the train, the whole concept of the movie sounds simple, even perhaps hokey but thanks to actors like Pine and especially Denzel this material works.

I was very impressed with how the train sequences were done, Denzel was equal parts subdued and intense depending on the situation and Pine does show some acting chops here too. It's definitely one of the surprise movies I've seen as I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did. Also starring Rosario Dawson among others. *** out of 4 stars.",1367712000,2,1751,4.520504731861199

4369555,5,B004FK2MWA,"I orginially watched this film because it happened in and through my hometown of Findlay, Ohio, and the engineer who eventually climbed aboard and stopped it was also from Findlay.  I have since purchased it and watch it over and over because I love it.  The secondary plot line for each character is a bit lackluster but it's not paramount to the heart of the movie which is brilliantly shot and edited to give viewers the feel of speed and sound. Having grown up in the prime era of train travel, the sights and sounds are authentic and stirring. If you have a home theater with surround sound, it's simply terrific!!

This is a film that is fun, fast, and loud. There is a minimum of ""language"" and no content you wouldn't want your kids or your mom to see. If you want absolute accuracy and complete believability in a film, select something else.  If you want a fast paced ride of just plain fun for an hour an a half, this is your movie.",1367366400,,943,4.371428571428571

4369558,4,B004FK2MWA,"Great pulse pounding action, terrifically-filmed action sequences, and a great film for a family popcorn and movie night.  The acting by the leads is good, too.  Much better than the critics gave them credit for.  That said, the screenplay lacks depth, and the GAPING plot holes and inconsistencies become very obvious on the second and subsequent viewings.  SPOILER ALERT  The control levers moving by themselves bothered me even on the first time through -- in the real incident, the engineer set the controls in the wrong position -- because the controls have detents to prevent that from happening.  The (fictional) town of Stanton became the largest city in Pennsylvania after Philly (much larger than either Pittsburgh or Allentown), and train and locomotive braking systems are improperly represented: they need air to hold them off, not to apply them like a truck.  This last detail, while it may not be as obvious to non-train buffs, still begs the question: if you're going to be down between the locos monkeying with coupler pins, why not just hook up the air lines (althought you would really need to OPEN the air cock and bleed off the air to stop the train), and finally, diesel electric locos like the ones in the movie generate a set amount of tractive effort in each throttle setting.  If you add weight or drag, the loco slows down.  Period.  It's not cruise control.  END SPOILERS.  Still, in spite of problems with the plot, it's a really entertaining movie and well worth seeing.  And BTW, if you're wondering about the dedication, the film is dedicated to the wife of the man who ran down the real runaway (Crazy Eights --CSX SD40-2 #8888), and Denzel Washington's agent, both of whom died while the film was in production.",1367193600,4,1745,4.835016835016835

4369560,2,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable is a moderately entertaining drama that is also a seemingly endless collection of stupid choices and absurd setups that are much more acceptable in a comedy. This movie requires that you turn your brain off. Way off. I failed to turn my brain all the way off, and I generally dislike like serious dramas that progress via absurdities. Ergo, I hated this movie and am completely stunned by how well reviewed it is.

This movie reminded me quite a bit of 1994's The Chase. In that movie, like Unstoppable, the news media are heavily woven into the fabric of the film. In The Chase, the media are used successfully and intentionally as a running joke. In Unstoppable, the media are used successfully for narration, but the attempt is so clumsy that it becomes near-comedy unintentionally. Here's an example. Another locomotive is used in an attempt to slowdown the runaway train. As soon as it appears, the media know who is driving it, have his picture, and seem to know his entire biography. You know, just how the media always knows everything perfectly in a developing situation. But it gets worse. Moments later the plan fails when the extra locomotive derails (and of course explodes immediately as Hollywood practice dictates). Seconds after that the reporters have pronounced the driver dead.

To the point, if you can't turn your brain off for this movie, don't even try to watch it unless you're watching just to see how poorly constructed it really is. And if you do decide that you should watch it, I recommend not spending any money to do so.

Updated 2013-08-24: After further thought, I decided this was worth two stars rather than one. I still don't think it is a very good movie, but it's way better than something like Speed 2. Although it is too much like Speed 2 in that the drama is manufactured to the point of absurdity.",1366848000,,1852,4.727554179566564

Ridiculous story (I know, very loosely based on a real event), terrible dialog, uninterested actors and on and on. Denzel definitely phoned this one in.
The clincher for me was the gratuitous use of helicopters in virtually every scene. It eventually became comic relief.
They were buzzing around like annoying houseflies and for some reason had to fly within feet of the train.
Of course they made sure to include the noise of the helicopters which practically drowned out the dialog (maybe not such a bad thing).

Unfortunately, the gear lever jumps from slow into high speed, so that the train moves faster than Dewey can catch up with it to get back on board. As the engine with its half-mile long train of wagons containing lethal cargo gathers momentum, it heads towards other trains on the tracks, in particular, one driven by veteran railman Frank Barnes (Denzil Washington) with his new young conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine). Colson has mistakenly attached five wagons too many onto the train, which makes it too long to fit into a siding out of the way of the runaway. The sum total of the plot revolves around attempts to bring this runaway train under control. The acting and direction (by Tony Scott, making his last film) are excellent.

Even though it starts out slow, I loved the humor of the two characters as they become friends while working on the railroad.

Lots of good train action which I like 'cause I am an avid railfan, but that's where the believability stops.  While based on a true story, that train never got up to these speeds and wass eventually stopped without injury.  Hollywood realy outdid themselves by making Unstippable, ""unbelievable"".  No train can take a curve like that, go up on one side and not go over into the storage tanks.  The engine Denzel is chasing with has only 3000 hp, yet he tells his dispatcher it has 5000, still not enough to catch two engines rated at 4,400hp each!!!  Denzel running along the tops of the grain hoppers and tank cars at nearly 60mph is also crazy.

I know, that's what the movie is about and I don't hate it but it just didn't grab me.  There were some nicely done scenes where are tense but overall, it's an ok movie for me.

Mixed in with the action are several personal stories that are very believable - a man trying to get back together with his ex and child, and a soon-to-be-forced-into-retirement railroad veteran who shows that he knows his trains and their capabilities. Together, they battle the unmanned beast that carries hazardous materials, and battle corporate idiocracy, leading to a cheering victorious end!

The other actor who coincidentally is also the new Captain Kirk in Star Trek is the new hope for the railroad, and they say they don't type cast in Hollywood. Immediately you have two people that have a reason for conflict. The movie portrays how these two men can set their differences aside because of the circumstances and work together to avert a catastrophe. Kind of sounds like what the American people say congress needs to do to avert the Fiscal Cliff. The movie has drama, action, and a really fast train.",1354060800,,653,4.589743589743589

4369654,1,B004FK2MWA,"Even if I had not worked in railroad operations for two Class I RR's, I would not have had trouble figuring out how ludicrous and completely lacking in authenticity this movie is.  From the get-go, with a runaway which never would have happened as portrayed, to the idea that RR's move hazardous materials without documentation (and must go to an oh-so-handy FRA inspector for info), to a train dispatcher needing to ask a crew where their train was, to yardmasters (of either gender) having time to wander around and ponder what to do, what to do in the face of crisis, to the means supposedly used to halt the out-of-control train.  A runaway train would have been derailed ASAP at a point as far from population centers as the railroad could arrange it.  Portable derails do do their job; it would only be a question of how long it would take to get an employee to get to the point where this device could be safely placed.  Railroading is a highly, highly regulated form of transportation.  All employees directly involved in the movement of trains must pass extensive rules exams at least once every two years.  Shippers must provide detailed information on shipments before a railcar is moved, and that is used to construct bills of lading required for transport.  Does it ever occur to those associated with creating films to do some basic research before making a movie, or are their products designed to check how low the IQ of the general public might be?
There is so much about railroading which would provide a factual, fascinating story lines.  I could spend the rest of my life writing, on the basis of my own experiences, and so could many other rails I know.",1353628800,2,1674,4.670068027210885

Anyway i went into the movie thinking ""i don't know, how great could a movie about a train be?"" Well i was completely shocked at how much i liked the movie it was really good and full of suspense even at the beginning before the train is sent off unmanned under power. It is much like the calm before the storm because you know going into the movie that at some point that train will be set loose. This doesn't allow you to relax it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch...wondering...waiting... Once the train is set loose it is non stop suspense as the train threatens everyone in the vicinity of it with its speed, weight, cargo and shear power. Honestly the train almost takes on its own demon-like persona one of the few other films i have seen that is able to make a vehicle look like the villain is the 1970's film ""Duel"" much like the tractor trailer in that film the train in this film is ominous when you see it on the screen it makes your heart pound as it heads toward a crowded crossing, not slowing, not hesitating just coming and fast.

4369675,4,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable - Review of the final Tony Scott Film

To put it bluntly, if Unstoppable were filmed by any other director the result would have been abysmal. Tony Scott draws upon his 20 plus years of directing to take this project to the big screen. His demanding requirements of what goes into his films, his use of camera angles and wide angle shots, the lack of any unnecessary CGI to give the viewer that sense of up close realism that has been absent in most films since the late 90's, make Unstoppable a movie to enjoy, not debate who's going to get the Oscar for this or that.

No one's winning any races or defending the friendly skies over the Atlantic, you're not going to hear bullets whizzing past you or someone yelling from the submarine command center ""Dive! Dive! Dive!"" . You won't find any catchy one-liners either. The action is more controlled, centered, human. It's a reality movie but with all the appeal of a big budget action movie.

The villain isn't a corrupt Big Brother watching from above in high definition, the villain isn't even a person, it's an unstoppable force with a mind of its own: a multi million pound train. Unstoppable is a true roller coaster ride all the way. It has character from Denzel Washington giving his 5th and final appearance in Scott's film legacy since 1995's Crimson Tide and Chris Pine teaming up with a very believable performance. They're the heroes of Unstoppable as they're top billed, but they're not supermen. They don't perform any miracle maneuvers in mid air while emptying two clips and reloading before hitting the ground. They're saving the day by doing what their characters were meant to do: their jobs. The film is based on real events and it's not going to bend reality so much as to have your head in a knot. You understand the characters, you can relate, you know their weaknesses and they're played against them to overcome not just the main obstacle but their own evils.

Unstoppable is a film that shows you everyday people going beyond their required duty to save the day. One of the best parts in the film is when they're told not to do anything and even threatened to be fired if they don't stop what they're doing. The antagonistic CEO asks him why he would risk his life when he's three weeks from retirement and it doesn't really hit you what this movie was about until then.

Forget about someone doing the impossible and nick of the moment acrobatics that get most movie goers raving and drooling for endless action and violence that is prevalent in most movies, this feature has none of it. It's about someone doing what they can because they were never asked to and because they know they must. Unstoppable was believable. Tony Scott gave us a final film from the heart, not something that will go down as the highest grossing blockbuster of all time, but as a true character piece, a visually captive approach to filmmaking and an inspiration to anyone out there who wonders what true heroes are.

They're not men of steel and dressed in capes, they're the ones who never give a thought to their own safety before diving in head first and ensuring someone else's and they could just as likely be you or me. And when they finally save the day you feel great, emotional, enriched with appreciation for these average Joes that remind us of Uncle Jack that used to work for Union Pacific for 25 years or maybe that friend of Steve who went out of his way that time back in '89 and saved some folks from harm. It gets you right in the heart and sticks.

Unstoppable is the last of Tony Scott's films and it rests comfortably at the end of his credits. He mentions in the special features that he's really making the same movie over and over each time, each time a little different but in a lot of ways they're the same, crafted from the same piece of clay or block of ice. I think I know what he means. He left his heart and soul in them and if you want to know what Tony Scott was all about, just give one of his films a try.

Final Thoughts
So we're left with a mystery as to why he took his life and it's likely that we'll never know the reason. I only hope he was satisfied with his work because I know I really enjoyed his movies over the years. I remember Top Gun and Days of Thunder the most. What I think I like the most about his films is how many times I can re-watch them and enjoy them the same each time. A lot of his films are that way. They had it all. He didn't make spectacular movies, he made great movies. The ones you can just watch for fun.

Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson and Kevin Dunn turn in good performances all around. The tension is on point for pretty much the entire time. I saw many people in the audience on the edges of their seats. Literally. I'm not just saying that because it's the cliche thing to say about a suspenseful movie. I heard plenty of gasps and 'oh no's' throughout the film, so it accomplished it's goal to exhilarate. Problem is, it fails to rise above what you see in the trailers. Big freight train carrying toxic chemicals is on the run, unmanned, and two unlikely partners have to save the day. Sorry for the cliche, but this movie is just the same old s**t on a different day (but with convincing characters). The main problem is just as I stated above. This movie is nothing more than what you see in the trailers. So if you liked what you saw, this is right for you. If it looked lame from the get-go, then guess what? ... Exactly. That said, I was actually one who thought to myself, ""what the hell are Tony Scott and Denzel Washington making another train movie for if the last one (Pelham 123 remake) wasn't well received?"" They have teamed up to make some pretty good movies in the past, or at least decent ones to other people that I loved (Man on Fire, Deja Vu, Crimson Tide).

This movie falls closer along the lines of another Taking of Pelham 123, but much more exhillerating. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your point of view. I've come not to expect much from Tony Scott, and that usually works for me.  If you take him at face value, you may enjoy most of his lesser appreciated movies more than you expect to. Another huge issue I had were the quick cuts, and the unsteady camera. How old are the gliding camera shots that pan across actors' faces when they're talking? I'm fairly tired of it, personally, but I can accept it when it shows a cinematographer's intent on doing something to aid the suspencs. And after the third camera shot from the tracks, beneath the train as it passes over, I got a little aggrivated. These old, and often annoying methods can work, and not irritate people like me if only the director and director of photography would learn the concept of moderation. Once, or even twice is fine, but beyond that is just overkill. These methods do work at getting some people in the audience's heart rates slightly elevated, but overall, they often end up coming off as cheap gimmicks when overdone. Now don't get me wrong. I recommend this movie, but barely.",1341964800,4,2602,4.498942917547569

----------------------------------------

**Brief Review**

I actually remember this happening years ago when I was in the 9th grade.  We were discussing it in class.  This happened roughly 10 years before the film 'Unstoppable' hit theaters.  I am not sure how accurate the movie is to the real life event, probably a LITTLE amped up.  Still, a runaway train is a runaway train, and that's BAD no matter how you slice it.

This film is EXTREMELY simple in it's story.  The fat brother from 'My Name Is Earl' jumps off a moving train to re-align some tracks, then he's too out of shape to get back on it.  It takes off down the tracks, un-maned and picking up speed with every mile.

Enter Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, Denzel's the veteran conductor and Pine is the new recruit starting his first day.  Both are fated to be the ones to try and stop this moving monster before it destroys an entire town.

As I said the story is pretty simple.  But a simple story is NOT a bad thing.  Sometimes a good action movie is just what the doctor ordered.  Sometimes a more character/story driven film such as 'The King's Speech' is needed.  FYI, I just saw 'The King's Speech' and it definitely lived up to the all the hype I've heard.

Long story short...Denzel and Chris stop the train, minimal deaths, minimal damage.  I have an especially soft spot for this film.  Back when I managed the video store, I must have listened to this thing play like 50 times...it was good to listen to while I worked.

--To Buy Or Not To Buy?--

Big question, should you buy this?  If the price is 8 bucks and below, pop on this.  Any higher and I would say pass.  There are no extras, just the action packed film.  I bought mine for 4.99 (used) and would recommend you shoot for this range.  While this is a good film, it's not worth a fortune.  You could always stream it or rent it as well I guess...it may be on network tv soon as well.

Well that's my 2 cents worth.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to MOVE, I'm typing this review on some train tracks and it looks like the train is coming!!!",1340150400,,2372,4.492957746478873

4369689,4,B004FK2MWA,"Usually when I think about trains I think of my childhood (and on) love affair with that then vanishing way of getting around. Simple enough when  the local commuter train, then soon to be abandoned in the 1950s golden age of the automobile, the highway and the Howrad Johnson's (and subsequently McDonald's) pit stop night, came tooting its lonesome whistle in the high North Adamsville night. Or that same fascination held up later when I took my first baby steps on the endless search for the great blue-pink American West night and wound up a few time travelling in some desolate empty  box car pushing the Southern Pacific high desert night. And no question, even now I have very strong memories of what Tom Waits called in one of his mule variation day dreams- ""living on train smoke and dreams.""

But enough of nostalgia, earned or not. For the film under review, Unstoppable,  is a very different cinematic look at the modern day train experience on the American tracks. Trains and disaster, or the threat of disaster,  are no strangers today, and have not been since the beginning of the railroads. The runaway train that stars in this film, the old 777 running highly dangerous cargo through rural Pennsylvania in this case, is just a continuation of the danger associated with tangling with the train smoke (from whatever fossil fuel used). And this saga is based on a real incident too boot.

Through carelessness (and corporate speed-up policies) a railroad man makes a series of wrong decisions about how to fix a problem on his long-line freight train. And the thing takes off-ummanned. Naturally all hell breaks loose as everyone from the yard master to corporate headquarters tries to figure out how to stop the thing short of shooting it (although that thought I am sure crossed somebody's mind). No problem though because old railroad man Denzel Washington, ready to be tossed on the washed-out heap and training his ""new boy replacement,""  just happens to be on that same track coming the other way. Now once Denzel Washington is on the case, any cinematic case, from cop to Malcolm X to washed-out train engineer, one can rest easy. Sure there will be a couple of close calls, quite a few actually, in the hour and one half of the film but at the end of the day no highly explosive cargo is going to harm urban areas. No way. Now we can all go back to thinking about train smoke and dreams.",1333411200,,2411,4.699052132701421
4369690,5,B004FK2MWA,"I lived near Bowling Green, Ohio when the real incident took place. I can remember the excitement generated as we followed the developments on TV. The real event, though worrysome, was not nearly as dramatic as the movie which relocates it to Pennsylvania rather than rural Ohio. I thought the acting, special effects and story-line were all well done. Watching it on Blue Ray with a Bose surround system was fantastic. It is a great family movie, though in places it may be a little intense for very young children.",1332806400,,516,4.7444444444444445

While this is not for the person who is looking for your gory or your shoot up bang bang action but it is a really good action movie none the less. It is not really slow pace, more that the intensity builds up, starting small perfectly bringing it up to the climatic moments.  The character background and buildup is amazing, making us understand why the characters are where they are at and why they are willing to do what they do now.  The whole movie is well put together, and believable, there is a flaw or two, but nothing that you really care about because rest of the movie fits together so well.

After a few minutes of set-up the train starts rolling, and from there it's just full steam ahead. The actors all did a fine job. With Denzel that's expected, but Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson were great too. Of course the real star of the film is the train. I think Pennsylvannia was a great location, as it seems to be train and mill country. I can't imagine how difficult it was to film Unstoppable. It's all real stunts and real trains.

4369701,2,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable is a really pedestrian film that bad in all departments except that Denzel helps drag it above the quality level of an episode of Burn Notice. The basic premise is that a train carrying some toxic chemicals has been sent on its driver-less way because the driver decided to get out of the hotseat after pressing the ""Go"" button. The obstacles and problems are all the sorts of things you'd get at a Screenwriters 101 course:

- There is a train full of schoolchildren coming the other way.
- The head boss corporate guy is trying to cover it up and/or cut corners.
- There's a nice little town in the way that looks like Main Street 50 years ago and it's going to get wiped out.

What we do have is an exciting if slight workplace thriller, a mad dash across a mythical Central Pennsylvania after an empty train going full throttle toward a populated area--oh, yeah...It's also filled with dangerous chemicals.

While the film has some nice touches, if seldom rises above a made-for-TV kind of plot. Though a far cry from some of Tony Scott's real turkeys (Domino comes painfully to mind) this director has done better work.

4369705,4,B004FK2MWA,"AN EPIC FILM
 The movie ""Unstoppable ""is an extraordinary movie, portraying the true story of an unmanned train posing an enormous threat to a nearby community.  The movie is directed by Tony Scott, written by Mark Bomback, and stars actors Denzel Washington and Chris pine.  Denzel Washington, who plays Frank in the movie truly plays his part as a responsible veteran train conductor.  The acting he portrays accurately presents his emotions at each moment in time.  For instance, when he is basically engaging on a suicide mission, he both shows his fear, but also his audacious character.  Chris Pine who plays Will, is able to show his growth in maturity and responsibility throughout the 2 hour movie.  At first he shows that all he cares about is his recent divorce, but as the situation occurs he gets his priorities straight and acts as a responsible co-conductor.  A unique acting skill Chris has is that he is able to precisely show his excruciating physical pain, incorporating peculiar movements and verbal signs of his pain.
Unstoppable, was a phenomenal movie, consisting both of epic scenes and drama.  Throughout the whole movie, the watcher is left in suspense, predicting what is going to happen at each moment, but always surprised with the outcome, for the movies is just that unpredictable.  The movie is capable of keeping an audience on their toes throughout the entire movie, whether it is between a near death situations, or of what step to take next in bringing the train to a halt, in order to prevent the unmanned train from contaminating a city with its toxic content. The visual affects presented in the movie are extraordinary and I highly recommend seeing the movie in I-Max, for it will immensely enhance the movie.  The movie consists of several epic explosion scenes.  For instance, there is a point in time when a diesel engine attempts to slow down and eventually stop the train by getting in front of the train and putting initiating its brakes.  Unfortunately, this plan proves to be unsuccessful, for the unmanned train devours the diesel engine, causing it to explode and kill the conductor.

The very end of the movie is predictable, but not in a disappointing way, for the events leading up to the end are not.  When you finally see the end result, you almost feel relieved, because everything ended up turning out fine, following all the other unsuccessful attempts.  There was a particular scene in the movie which consisted of drama, propelled action and suspense.  In this scene Will is jumping from box car to box car, anticipating to reach the front of the train. As this is happening the train is at a speed of over 60 mph and at each box car, he has to manually initiate the brakes.  There are also helicopters and other vehicles traveling nearby.  The age recommendation truly fits the movie, for there are several scenes incorporated into the movie, which have the potential to scare children 12 and under.  Unstoppable was a phenomenal movie consisting of drama, propelled action and suspense.",1326240000,,3048,4.881553398058252

4369708,5,B004FK2MWA,"This is ""Speed"" (1994) on rails.

A half a mile long runaway freight train barrels down a populated area in southern Pennsylvania at 50 miles an hour. If not stopped safely, a lot of people may die.

The clock ticks on a ""missile the size of the Chrysler building"" that's tearing through the small towns of Southern Pennsylvania's countryside. It's loaded with tons of toxic chemicals. Who's going to stop it?

Why, the veteran locomotive driver Frank (Denzel Washington) of course and his younger sidekick Will (Chris Pine) who both have some strikes against them.

Frank has already been fired by the management, and is 72 days into his 90 days of notice. So he has to risk his life not to save the company that sacked him but the innocent people of PA. He's a contemporary cowboy riding a runaway ""metal horse"" with two outcomes: either he'll succeed stopping it or will die with it.

Will has pulled a gun on a cop to defend his wife and is in deep trouble both with the law and his wife. The judge issued a restraining order to save his wife from another close encounter. Now it's time to redeem himself against all odds.

After the first attempt to stop the runaway train ""777"" ends with a derailment, explosion, and death of a veteran driver, Frank and Will devise a plan: they will race backwards and catch the 777 from its tail end. They'll hitch to 777 and then gun their own engine in the reverse direction to slow it down. We expect a metal to metal confrontation and the sparks to fly and they do!

Tony Scott, the director, said ""this was the physically and mentally the toughest movie I've directed"" and he may be right about it. ""Unstoppable"" is a thriller full of action scenes that keeps you at the edge of your seat.

Super action entertainment with a predictable redemption theme. Recommended.",1325635200,,1813,4.574074074074074

Based on a real life incident, a mile long freight train carrying toxic chemicals is turned loose - by accident not terrorists - across the Pennsylvania countryside.  Frank (Washington) and Will (Chris Pine), become reluctant heroes who get stuck on the same track.  The film is the right length (98 min.) and has the right plot.  That is, not much of one.  Just the train hauling ass across the state.  Not much sidetracks the action.  Just how it happened, how can it be fixed and can it be done in an hour and a half.  Granted there's nothing of heft here, just thrills.  Yes, there are a few too many police cars showing up in critical scenes and one too many car crashes, but I sure liked the 70 mph locomotive demolishing things that get stuck on the track.

4369712,3,B004FK2MWA,"Don't be fooled by the title, this film is anti-climactic and thus disappointing.

Washington (in his second train-based film in a row with Scott and 5th film with him overall) and Pine play the cliched due of retiring veteran and rookie who are grinding away another day at the train yard. But the incompetence of a fat yard worker allows a half-mile long freight loaded with hazardous chemicals to get loose and tear through the countryside. Our heroes then put aside their usual chores to catch up with the loco and hit the brakes all while head office and the media watch and wait.

Sound exciting. It's not. There's no real sense of speed. Tony Scott tries to make the audience believe that the train is going really fast with lots of quick, shaky camera pans and some annoying stutter cuts (when will THIS dumb trend come to an end?). It hits a few bumps and scratches a few cars, but no significant damage is done and no breathtaking destruction fills the screen with eye candy.

I really have to wonder where the appeal was in the script. There's really nothing worth mentioning between the moment the trains starts and stops (yes, it does indeed stop). If this were a 70s disaster epic it would be 140 minutes long (as opposed to 98), would feature many, many deaths, even more obstacles, and would end with the train blowing up...and all with a PG-rating. In 2010 an easy ride with a couple of flash pans is apparently the best that they can do.

Not a keeper.

  Each time we see it on the television broadcast we see the words 'Runaway Train'.  Why is the movie not called that? Because that movie has already been made featuring Eric Roberts, John Voight, and Rebecca Demorney. I think it is a better movie.",1323734400,,778,4.301369863013699

Excellent performances by Pine and Washington, along with a good supporting cast, made this an easy decision for purchasing to see it again at home. The movie has it's share of tension and excitement in trying to control this runaway train loaded with, (what else?) hazardous material. True to life, it could not be full of milk or orange juice.  We are also able to experience what it is like to go through the rail yards and inside the cabs of the monster locomotives. In my opinion, a movie worthy of a second or third viewing.

I am not a railroad engineer but I question when the throttle accidentally slips out of the neutral position, to initiate the runaway train, why it would go to notch 8 (full throttle).  Also, wouldn't it be possible to activate the train's brakes by rupturing the air hose line? Since it was based on a true incident there must have been reasons which were not explained, or I didn't pick up on the way the train operates.

4369722,1,B004FK2MWA,"So basically this movie is about a runaway train.  2 stereotype movie characters, Wise Grizzled Old-Timer (Denzel) and Raw but Courageous Newbie (Pine) have to stop it.

They add in some moronic dialog and some fake tension involving schoolkids, and a lame non-story about Pine's marital troubles and Denzel's pension to pad the running time.  There is also a woefully miscast Rosario Dawson looking and sounding like she wandered in from another movie that is set in the Bronx.

But in essence there is nothing more to this movie than a train approaching a curve at a high speed.  It could almost be an old-time silent film, it's just missing the girl tied to the tracks.  That's not to say movies like this can't be suspenseful - Speed being a prime example - but this one isn't suspenseful at all.

I won't give away the ending.  But either they stop it... or they don't.  Take a guess before watching, you'll probably be right.",1321574400,4,931,4.662576687116564

A series of human errors occur because of distractions and overconfidence and the lack of sufficient knowledge about how trains function. These are intensified by rivalries between older and younger generations and family problems. As a result a train is moving unmanned at 70-75 miles an hour, toward Trenton, Pennsylvania, filled with hazardous materials that will, unless stopped or at least slowed down, turn over when it reaches a turn at the town and, like a missile, destroy the town and kill people.

The continuity errors are ridiculous from the start and the fact that it is based on true events make the people involved seem like morons. Police shooting at a stop button on the train which is next to a fuel tank - genius. The only thing that could have made it worse would be for John Cusack to pop up with a 2012-esque performance. Denzel Washington is the one bright spot but I think it is time he moves away from train-based movies... Avoid this film at all costs.,1320710400,3,665,4.370967741935484

The acting is also pretty good, with Denzel Washington delivering as usual, though some of the characters are somewhat cliched.  Also, I do think there's a bit of a plot flaw in the sense that a little creative thinking reveals some easier ways to stop that train, but that's not a major problem since most people probably won't think of these ways during the movie.

On a more technical point, I have some professional experience with failure investigation, and I'd like to note that this scenario for developing a runaway train isn't unrealistic.  It may seem too coincidental for so many things to go wrong, both at physical and psychosocial levels, but that's generally how major failures happen.  Such coincidences are rare, and that's why major failures are rare, but in a big and complex world, they're inevitably going to happen now and then.

It's THAT good!

I'm still pretty darn amazed just how much I enjoyed Unstoppable while watching it this afternoon.  I *almost* passed it up too, believing it couldn't be anywhere as good as the description says.  I was totally wrong!

It's exactly what you've been reading about- a train goes out of the control when the driver makes a silly, critical mistake and is forced to jump off the train to correct the problem (while the train is in motion).

Of course he's so out of shape he's unable to get back on the train before it takes off on its own and eventually builds up enough speed to become a serious threat to major populated areas.  Not only that, but the train is carrying dangerous chemicals that threaten the safety of innocent people all over town.

Throughout the film many people try to stop the train but everyone fails hard and heavy.  I'm surprised how much detail was involved pertaining to train knowledge.  The movie writers must have brought in some professionals to make everything seem so believable.

Overall, the action is beyond amazing and continuous, the acting is really intense and defines edge of your seat suspense the way it involves a rookie train driver clashing with the professionals and attempting to make a point that even a rookie can get the job done, and it's just a really spectacular movie overall.

There probably isn't a moment in ""Unstoppable"" that we don't see coming down the track from a long way off but, in the age of Michael Bay (not to single out the poor man), an old-school action movie that takes place in the ""real world"", sans robots, vampires, wizards or excessive CGI, is a welcome relief. Just a crafty, fun entertainment for those evenings when you wish you were as brave and wise and competent an engineer as Denzel Washington. Hope there's no sequel, though (""Unstoppable II: Snakes on a Train!"").",1315872000,,719,4.6171875
4369739,4,B004FK2MWA,"The brothers Scott are among the best moviemakers in the business; Ridley and Tony know how to tell a story via stunning visuals and heart-pounding action.  In UNSTOPPABLE Tony puts on the proverbial throttle from virtually the beginning of the film and doesn't even think about pulling it back; the result is nonstop mayhem, violence, and destruction that very much makes the film's $100 million budget not surprising.  Tony gets to tear up a lot of. . .stuff. . .in UNSTOPPABLE, a movie about a doofus who leaves his moving train to personally throw a switch--only the train gets away from him.  And speeds up; we're talking 70 mph speeds as it races through rural Pennsylvania on its way to a fictionalized metro (Stanton?), where certain derailment awaits--and of course the train is pulling several tankards of highly toxic chemicals.

Yep.  That's why I took my heart pills as I was watching this puppy.

While the railroad's execs dither on what to do another locomotive is in the area, operated by a crafty veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) and his wet-behind-the-ears conductor (Chris Pine).  When they're not snapping at one another Denzel's character is waxing philosophical while Pine's character is trying to smooth over a restraining order filed by his wife.  Ignoring the orders of the execs--who have decided to derail the train before it reaches the city--the rogue team pursues the train--in reverse--in an effort to connect to the runaway train's last car; then, they theorize, they'll put on the brakes to slow the runaway down.  Naturally, Scott really ratchets up the action here, and UNSTOPPABLE hurls like a rocket towards its climactic (yet sometimes cartoon-like) ending.  And Rosario Dawson looks darn good as a railroad operations supervisor, even though all she does is basically talk into a headset.  (Lucky headset.)  UNSTOPPABLE is an appropriate title, as it aptly identifies this film's thrills.

Pros:  That Unstoppable is an exciting movie goes without saying.  Other virtues include able acting, a good build-up, and a memorable setting.  Rural Pennsylvania has a character all its own, which the movie captures fairly well.  It's easy to sympathize with the runaway train's potential victims, who no doubt endure enough problems trying to survive in this depressed swath of flyover country without having their town explode.

In sum, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.

Cons:  I wouldn't say that the inevitable Hollywood cliches derail Unstoppable, but they do grate after a while.  (There's no need to elaborate.  You'll know 'em when you see 'em.)

The camera work is nearly flawless. It adds to the suspense. Denzel Washington is quite comfortable with his character. This role is classic Denzel Washington. He and Chris Pine have good chemistry and Rosario Dawson steals the show as Connie, the trainmaster who orchestrates the rescue. Lew Temple's portrayal of the welder-turned-hero, Ned, is slightly overdone, but servicable.

You may start out watching this movie just to kill time, but you'll soon be drawn in and lose track of time. I couldn't believe how quickly this movie moves along.

4369766,3,B004FK2MWA,"FILM RATING:  2.5 stars

Unstoppable (2010) is director Tony Scott's latest attempt at creating another engaging, smart, techie, action/thriller/drama movie like Top Gun (1986), Days Of Thunder (1990), Crimson Tide (1995), Enemy of the State (1998), and Deja Vu (2006). Unfortunately, Scott doesn't quite get there with this one. While Unstoppable isn't quite unwatchable, it's probably not all that re-watchable. Once you've seen it, there's little to go back for. Even at 98 minutes, the movie dragged on for me. Scott has all of the technical cinematic ingredients, as he always seems to have in his movies. But once again, after failed attempts with The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3 (2009) and Spy Game (2001), Scott just didn't have a really good story and script to work from. At least that's my excuse for him. I know he can put together incredible movies like the five I listed above, all of which are favorites of mine. But like every great movie, it all starts with the script, and screenwriter Mark Bomback just didn't come through here. It's not a bad story. It's even written well in terms of dialogue. But there's just no emotional core to the characters. They're very one-dimensional...and even the great Denzel Washington can't get his character Frank into my psyche or my heart like so many of his other great characters.

Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson give solid performances and round out a solid cast. But they seem to have nothing really to act for. A runaway train with no one at the helm just doesn't make for much of an engaging plot here. I kept wishing Dennis Hopper would show up and give this Speed (1994) wannabe a bad guy that I could hate. I kept thinking that Unstoppable was basically a remake of Speed with a train instead of a bus. And haven't we had enough Speed remakes already? And to be honest, didn't Scott just work with Denzel Washington and trains in The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3...the year before? Hopefully Scott finds his way back to a good script soon because I definitely love his style of filmmaking when paired with good material.

On the positive side, Unstoppable looks and sounds absolutely spectacular on blu-ray, which is the format I saw it in this week. As always, Scott brings on board a great director of photography (Ben Seresin) who provides simply awesome cinematography. When it comes to shooting planes, trains, and automobiles...and submarines, motorcycles, helicopters and any other possible moving piece of machinery, director Tony Scott is about as good as it gets. I'm sure the coordination necessary to bring all of these various moving metal objects together into one camera frame requires a whole team of assistant directors, producers, and various crew. But it's those scenes, when all of these various moving metal objects are actually moving around with each other, that kept me involved in the movie. The multiple helicopters, trains, and automobiles are just incredible to see together.

No one seems to bring all of the technical action and stunts together in the editing room like Scott. Of course credit should be given to film editors Robert Duffy and Chris Lebenzon, who did a good job keeping the film moving along with their final cut. But Scott's filmmaking style is definitely stamped on the cut as well.  Reinforcing the incredible action in this film is top notch sound design and editing by sound supervisor Mark P. Stoeckinger, with his accompanying 28 other sound department crew members. Unstoppable was nominated for the Best Sound Editing Oscar last year, and you can definitely hear why when watching this film! Rounding out the technical praise for Unstoppable, is good production design by Chris Seagers and his enormous team. Every little detail shines through in the sets, locations and with all of the trains, cars, and helicopters. The textures, colors, and materials used throughout the film give it a modern feel that works nicely on film.

I was a bit torn between giving Unstoppable 3 stars or 2.5 stars, but I settled on 2.5 because I think the likelihood of me watching this movie again anytime soon is really slim. There's just nothing in the story to go back to. No emotion to feel again. No thoughts to think again. No riddles to unravel. And no character tension to try and release. Unstoppable is a first class production, as director Tony Scott is well known for. But in the annals of filmdom, Unstoppable didn't make much of a mark. It just rolled on through at 70 mph, leaving the tracks empty for the next film to come along and replace it.",1310083200,,4548,4.853092783505154
4369767,5,B004FK2MWA,"Indeed it is pure action from start to finish.  That is, if you can overlook all the goofs.  And don't take my word for it, go to the  IMDB site for ""unstoppable"" and click on link for goofs, the list is endless.  It is a movie for those who want to be entertained and know nothing about railroads, as much of what is depicted about trains and their braking syustems is purely fictional. It is based on a true incident that occured in Ohio, not Texas or Pennsylvania as others have stated.  But in that case, only a locomotive got loose.  The problem starts when an intellectually challenged hostler--played by ""Randy,"" the idiot brother of Earl on ""My Name Is Earl,""  lets a train get away.  Denzel Washington and Chris Pine play the two heros who finally stop the train.  It is pure, non stop action and also shows the arrogant and  moronic behaviour of corporate types.  That was the most realistic part of the movie.  It is worth a view but not since ""Runaway Train"" and ""Atomic Train"" have we had such total b.s. in a motion picture related to trains.",1309392000,,1056,4.442708333333333

The story starts with Pine and Washington in a Locomotive going on a routine pick up of coal cars to transport them to another warehouse. In another location maintenance workers forget to connect a portion of the brakes on a two-mile-long train. As the long train moves along the tracks a careless engineer leaves the Locomotive with the throttle stick on to pull a malfunctioning track-switch. The problem is the train starts moving faster and faster as the out of shape engineer can't catch up to the train and it gets away from him. Throughout the movie the runaway train crashes into empty cars, horse trailers and train blockades. Nothing stops it as it heads toward a major city at speeds up to 70-75 mph with several cars full of toxic chemicals. I won't tell you how it ends but Washington and Pine in the first train devise a last minute plan to stop the runaway train as they risk all to save hundreds of thousand of lives who are depending on them including their respective families!",1308614400,2,1162,4.618357487922705

The conductor of a train makes a stupid mistake and leaves a moving train for just a second.  The internal switches slip and it becomes a runaway train, gradually increasing speeds.  It just so happens that there are several cars of a toxic substance on the runaway train.

Denzel Washington plays a veteran train engineer (of 28 years I think) who knows the tricks of the trade that you cannot find in books.  Chris Pine (of Star Trek) plays a young conductor.

Realistically, I don't know why they could not have fixed the situation earlier in the movie, except that it was written in the script that way.  STILL, I enjoyed it.  It also touches on dumb management decisions, management arrogance, and the stupidity of a company wanting to get rid of older, experienced workers so they can hire younger ones (probably at a lower salary and less benefits).

Some parts were unrealistic and they copied the scene from Runaway Train when Chris Pine's character hurt his foot. If you want to see a good train movie,I suggest Runaway Train with Eric Roberts.

Which makes sense, because much of the film I just couldn't quite suspend disbelief, and kept rolling my eyes going 'no way!'

Putting all that aside though, overall I enjoyed the film, mostly because of Denzel Washington. In my opinion, he is just riveting to watch in almost anything, and I enjoyed him here, even though he doesn't get that much to work with dramatically. What he does get, he spins into gold.

The movie is also non-stop excitement - like the train, it never stops moving. So Denzel + non-stop action = 4 stars to me, even if the script and story were less than stellar.",1306108800,2,952,4.372881355932203

4369780,4,B004FK2MWA,"`Unstoppable' is a film that is so gripping and exciting that it will have you on the edge of your seat for much of the duration.

Inspired by true events this film follows Frank Barnes and Will Colson as they attempt to stop a runaway train in Pennsylvania.  When a set of unlucky circumstances come together and a train is left without an engineer, carrying a highly flammable, toxic load, into a highly populated area at great speed, it will take great bravery and forward thinking to stop it.  Fortunately you get exactly these attributes in Frank and Will.

Washington (as Frank) is as good as we have come to expect and Chris Pine plays the roll of Will very well indeed.  There are other excellent performances, most notably from Rosario Dawson as a railway despatcher clearing the line and giving advice.

This is a relatively short film at around 98 minutes, but it kept me hooked and jittery throughout.  There is something about a runaway train that makes you very nervous.  The extra elements of the flammable cargo and the fact this is based on true events make it all the more potent.

This is well scripted, directed and acted and made for one exciting and compelling film and I recommend it highly indeed.

The Film 4/5

After directing movies about planes, cars and a submarine, Tony Scott's last two efforts have involved trains. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 used a train as a setting, but Scott goes a step further in Unstoppable, making a train one of the movies' stars. Trains are big. Scott has Washington walk in front of a few at the start of the movie to show us just how big they are.

An irresponsible worker makes two mistakes that set events in motion, deciding to move a train without connecting the air brakes and then leaving the cabin to pull a lever at the side of the track. The train is moving too fast for him to get back on and pulls away under full power.

Will Colson (Pine) has been a conductor for four months. He reports to work and faces resentment from the older workers. They assume he's inexperienced and think that younger, cheaper workers may be a threat to their own job security. He's assigned to work with Frank Barnes (Washington), who has similar feelings. Colson makes a couple of mistakes and Barnes thinks his fears are justified.

The runaway train is initially thought to be a ""coaster,"" but it soon becomes clear that it's under power and capable of traveling at approximately 70 mph. An early effort to board it fails, so a decision has to be made. Yard Master Connie Hooper (Dawson) suggests derailing it before it reaches populated areas. Her bosses disagree because they are worried about the financial cost.

Various other attempts fail to stop the train and it's left to our heroes, Barnes and Colson, to try their own solution. They give chase in their train and plan to link up with the runaway and use their own brakes to stop it.

Other factors are also thrown into the mix. A group of children on a school trip are on a train on the same line as the runaway and the threat of a collision is high. The runaway is pulling half a mile of freight cars and several contain volatile chemicals. The track leads to a curve which has a speed limit of 15 mph and it's close to a heavily populated town.

Just enough time is given to establishing the back stories of Barnes and Colson and it explains their motivations for chasing down the runaway. The tension builds throughout the second half of the movie and the action rarely allows us to take a breather. Failed attempts early in the story show us that our heroes are in danger if they continue the pursuit, but the alternative is a potentially huge disaster should the train derail.

The story doesn't sound very complicated and it isn't. The action takes center stage, but what did you expect? I found myself engaged throughout and the three main actors put in good performances. I'm rarely disappointed by Washington and I also liked Pine and Dawson here.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Unstoppable looks good on Blu-ray. Scott seems to have made some of the colors unnaturally bright, making everything stand out. The train in particular looks imposing with its red and yellow paintwork. Detail is excellent throughout and the print is clean. It felt like most of the action was taking place right in front of me.

Audio Quality 5/5
Nominated for a sound editing Oscar, Unstoppable sounds great too. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix places us in the middle of the action. Trains aren't just big, they're heavy. The track makes us aware of that with a pounding rumble that will give your sub a good workout. It's backed up by the squeal of brakes and metal-on-metal. Dialogue comes across clearly and there's plenty of supporting effects from the rears.

Special Features 3.5/5

Overall score 4/5

Action movies can be dumb and full of clumsy exposition, but Unstoppable isn't one of those movies. Scott has made a largely believable story which includes characters with a little depth. It has plenty of replay value because I have already watched it three times and it's still an enjoyable ride.

4369785,4,B004FK2MWA,"An obviously fictionalized retelling of an actual event, `Unstoppable' is fast paced and engaging from start to finish, despite its limited themes.  In the film version of the story, an unmanned train wreaks havoc as it gains speed and becomes uncontrollable.  A veteran railroad engineer, recently given his `notice', decides to play hero while out training a rookie train conductor.  The pair, oddly mixed yet more similar than expected, take on the treacherous task of manually stopping the train.  Thanks to the chemistry between Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, `Unstoppable' maintains our attention, and deservedly so.  The plot at times seems farfetched, and the action can seem over the top and yet it all works thanks to some spitfire editing and sharp direction from Tony Scott, the lesser (yet the vastly underrated) of the two Scott brothers.  With nicely shot cinematography, expertly used visual effects and an effective score, `Unstoppable' is a lot more fun and thrilling and memorable than one may expect.  The rather unexpected heaps of praise the film received were certainly justified.  It's an obvious fabrication of actual events in order to heighten the `thrill factor', and yet it reads honest thanks to the dedication from everyone involved.

4369794,4,B004FK2MWA,"Once again director tony Scoot(Ridleys brother) teams up with Denzel Washington to deliver a fast paced action movie, this time involving a runaway train, you would have thought Denzel would have beens sick at even the mere thought of a train after the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123.

This time however he's the one on the train as he plays Frank Barnes who has been a railroad engineer for 28 years and hes training rookie Will Colson(played by Chris Pine) who''s fresh out of conductor's college and is having martial problems and who's mind doesn't seem to be fully on the job on hand, so much so that he attaches too many carriages to their train which is on course with a runaway train that's carrying highly flammable liquid and is going at 70mph. So of course the only two people who can stop the runaway train are Barnes and Colson! They have aid in the form of Connie Hooper(played by Rosario Dawson) a train yardmaster who has radio contact with them. Oscar Galvin(played by Kevin Dunn) is vice-president of AWVR and all he cares about is the money and bad publicity it's going to cost them. So what follows is Galvin trying loads of different ways to stop the train before it hits the curve in Stanton which is home to Colson's estranged wife. What follows is a fast paced movie that doesn't require too much attention to follow, no mad twists or disgruntled villains out to blow up the world unless he gets his money, no it's just a runaway train.

The movie is inspired by the CSX 8888 incident that happened in Ohio in 2001 which also involved a runaway train. The movie is well worth a watch for it's fast paced action, the sound on the blu ray did sound a bit muffled at times(listening through a high end amp and speakers), the picture was also not of the best quality(watching on a panasonic full hd tv) at times.

4369810,4,B004FK2MWA,"I'm a railfan and I like watching trains. I therefore am awarding this movie one star more than I think should really be the case. It's a well-made film, with lots of action and just enough character development to make the principle characters (though not what they are portrayed as doing) credible. The star of the movie is the train, and here I must give a tip of the hat to director Tony Scott for using as much real railroad footage as possible, even though I have to say that to someone accustomed to watching trains the speeds claimed by the movie are patently not the speeds at which the trains are running.

Never mind, it's all good, clean, edge-of-the-seat fun and if the ending is rather predictable (and belies the title) I'm old-fashioned enough to be happy with that.

The two documentaries are very good, but I'd caution anyone who decides to switch on Tony Scott's commentary that his style is a stream-of-consciouness ramble which tells you a lot about Tony Scott but not much about what you are watching on the screen.

4369813,3,B004FK2MWA,"In May of 2001, a 47-car freight train belonging to the CSX Corporation rolled out of rail yards near Toledo. Twenty-five of the train's cars were empty. Of the 22 cars that were not, two were tank cars containing liquid phenol, a hazardous chemical (though not in itself explosive). This particular train was noteworthy because, as a spokesperson for CSX explained to the media, the engineer was ""nearby"" when the train departed - ""nearby"" being PR-speak for ""not on board.""  Over the following two hours, the unmanned train traversed 66 miles of Ohio countryside, at one point reaching a speed of 47 mph (though, as simple arithmetic suggests, averaging around 33 mph). Police manned crossings to ensure the train passed without incident. A second engine managed to link to the train and, by braking, slow it to 10 mph on an upgrade, where a railroad employee was able to board the train and stop it.

From acorns mighty oak trees grow. In Hollywood, incidents like the one described above inspire movies: movies that, like mighty oak trees, belie their humble origins.  But isn't that one of Hollywood's imperatives: to spin entertaining tales from events of real life, and in doing so, transport us to magical realms? Yes! Unfortunately, the trip this film took me on is one I have taken before: the scenery and the stops were all-too familiar, as were the people I met along the way. [Spoiler!] Crucially, I found zero suspense in the fate of the train: were it to derail and precipitate the potential disaster suggested, what would you do with Denzel Washington's and Chris Pine's characters? Indeed, where would you take the story? No, the story only works (if it works at all) if it ends with cheers and high-fives all around.

4369816,3,B004FK2MWA,"Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Denzel Washington (Man on Fire) star as a pair of train conductors who bravely chase down a runaway train throughout Pennsylvania, which is loaded with lethal toxic chemicals.

First off, what does this movie do wrong? Well, ALMOST EVERYTHING! The characters are stock, cardboard cutouts with little personality. The dialogue is painfully schmaltzy and overdramatic. Tony Scott's directing is ALL OVER the place, complete with unnecessary flashing, goofy zoom-ins, and a bit of shakey-cam thrown in for bad measure. Admittedly however, his work isn't quite as bad as that on the ""Pelham 1, 2, 3"" remake. Oh, and how many cliches? Dad with estranged daughters? Check. Guy with estranged girlfriend who will seek redemption by risking his life? Check. The big business mogul who cares on about the company's losses and not those of innocent people? Check. A corny high-fiving ending? Double check.

On the upside, I did like the stuntwork and action sequences. They were pretty well-staged and genuinely intense. Also, I liked how practical FX were primarily used; no CGI here folks, we actually a train crashing through stuff and real, on-camera helicopters chasing it down with real stuntmen hanging from the choppers. Good stuff.

Overall, if you can get past the lame and painfully cliched storyline and melodramatic acting, the action setpieces are worth the wait and a good way to run down 100 minutes.",1301529600,,1433,5.141630901287554
4369817,3,B004FK2MWA,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked the fast pace and constant suspense.  I even enjoyed the two lead actors arguing with each other.
  One scene really bothered me, watching it the second time.  This is not a spoiler, and I don't want to spoil it for others. But in the middle of the movie, when they put a locomotive in front of the train to try to slow it down, why couldn't they have had a second man hop from the one locomotive to the other, and shut it down?  That seems a lot more safe to me than all of their other attempts to board the runaway train, like trying to jump on it from a helicopter, or from a pickup truck.  Of course that would have ended the movie at that point.
 I give it 3.5 stars.  Any movie that employs shaky camera work, automatically loses points with me.  It is an annoying little fad in hollywood movies these days, that I hope will soon fall out of favor.  These producers and directors are not being as realistic as they think.  The next time you see someone riding a bike down a rough road, notice how stable their head is, as their body and bike absorbs most of the shocks.

I also remember since I was involved in the chase the runaway train CSX had in Rochester NY. I and my conductor at the time were asked to leave Lyons NY and try to chase it down. So I can tell you from experience this is an intense situation and Denzel and Chris did a great job letting you feel how intense a situation it is. I have a few issues with technical errors involving the use of the automatic air brake in place of the independent. For those unaware the brake handle that Chris Pine uses on the curve when Denzel tells him to use the independent brake is actually the automatic. For those unaware the automatic brake is basically the train brake which requires the air hoses to be connected to be of any significant use; otherwise, in many instances you would have less braking force than if the independent/engine brake was used. Another technical error relates to the alertor or ""deadmans"" feature, not only does it apply the brakes when it goes off it also kills the throttle (unless the feature is totally cut-out). I could give more technical issues that bothered me; however I really had fun watching this movie and am able to look past this. I recommend people give it a chance. The railroad talk was not bad and actually resembled some conversations I can remember having myself with conductors.

4369824,3,B004FK2MWA,"If you're looking for fluff without an original thought (or line) to be found, plus stuff blowing up and Chris Pine briefly without a shirt, well here's your movie.

Unstoppable is pretty badly written and rife with every action-movie clich in the book (suits and/or fat guys making decisions that put people at risk?  Check.  Buddy team of heroes... one old, one young, formerly combative but now in sync, each with personal/woman issues?  Check.  Spunky chick  wisecracking and helping to save the day... from a safe distance?  Check.  Everything bad that could possibly happen all happening at once, plus a town that stores all it's fuel near the most dangerous train-track curve?  Yep.).

But it is what it is and it doesn't pretend to be lofty or deep.  So if you just want an exciting action flick - this will work.  It's slow to start but it does build to a few tense moments, and Chris Pine, Denzel Washington, and Rosario Dawson are all easy on the eyes.  We enjoyed it, without ever wanting to watch it again.

BOTTOM LINE:  Worth a rental (NOT a purchase) if you're looking for an action-adventure.",1301097600,,1109,4.703125
4369825,4,B004FK2MWA,"I'll admit that when I first heard the storyline from the movie UNSTOPPABLE I didn't think it sounded very interesting. It's difficult to make a movie about a speeding train exciting. You know it's confined to a track and that it moves fast with the chance of slipping off the rails but how could that be exciting? The makers of this movie, especially director Tony Scott proved me wrong. And I'm glad about that.

It's Will's (Chris Pine) first day as a conductor on a normal day for this train. His engineer is Frank (Denzell Washington), soon to retired and making one of his last runs. But their day will turn out to be anything but ordinary.

Two goofups are at another station moving a different train. When the switch to move it to a different track isn't set, the engineer jumps down to reset it himself, leaving the train in neutral. Not only that, the air breaks haven't been set yet but since they're just moving it to another line they're not concerned. That is until the train shifts into high speed mode and leaves the station before he and his conductor can get on board.

The train picks up speed the further down the line it goes. Without the air breaks there's no way to stop it. To make matters worse, the load this train was carrying contained dangerous toxic chemicals. If that wasn't enough, the line the train is heading down has a section with a tight curve that there is no way to make without derailing.

The train is on a collision course with two trains on the same track. One is a group of school students learning about train safety. The other is Will and Frank's cargo train. Their train narrowly misses being demolished. After a discussion with controller Connie (Rosario Dawson), Frank comes up with a possible plan of his own to stop the train.

As higher ups try and decide what to do Connie (Rosario Dawson) attempts to assist them. But of course they think she doesn't know what she's talking about and brush her off. They're plan is to derail the train in a smaller town with a piece of equipment that Frank has told Connie has no chance of working at the speed the train is moving. When it does indeed fail, Connie, Frank and Will follow through with their own plan, even though the top dogs have threatened to fire them if they do.

The drama of the film escalates at the same pace the train is making. Frank and Will's train is racing against time going backwards to catch up to the non-stop express. Will they make it in time? Will their plan work? Hey, I might tell you a few things that happen in a movie but I won't reveal the end.

Washington and Pine do a great job here as two men who just met but who become close through the situation they find themselves in. Each has problems of their own back home that play into their decision, but never to the point that they abandon the chance to save innocent lives. These are not men who became heroes over time but who have a definite moral core that guides them to make the choice to save lives.

Based on a true story, the events that unfold in this film are set at a pace that won't allow you to sit still comfortable on the couch and not care. It draws you in, waiting to see what attempts are made, which ones work and waiting to see if the plan Frank and Will have come up with must be used or not.

The pacing of the film is perfect. Not only does Scott gradually increase the speed of the train, he slowly unravels the stories of the two heroes as well. Back history and current situations drive them to the decision they make. And that makes for not just an interesting film but one that holds your interest from the time the train leaves the station until the climax of the film. This one is one you won't want to miss.",1301011200,2,3722,4.343884892086331
4369826,4,B004FK2MWA,"""Unstoppable"" is a heart-pounding action flick that reminds me a lot of 1999's superb ""Speed"", with its cast of ordinary citizens and an ordinary vehicle hurtling toward destruction. At Fuller Yard in Northern Pennsylvania, the 39-car train 777 gets away from its operator when he abandons the cabin to fix a switch. Meanwhile, at Brewster Yard in Southern Pennsylvania, veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and novice conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) don't quite hit it off. They're heading toward Stanton in train 1206. When it is discovered that 777 is not coasting but is under power and picking up speed, carrying a load of molten phenol and diesel fuel, the Fuller yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) clashes with her company's VP Oscar Gavin (Kevin Dunn) on how to cope with the crisis.

The day begins slowly, as people go about their jobs on the railroad. It takes everyone a while to grasp the extent of the problem. The audience gets to know them. The film's title sequence claims it was ""inspired by true events"", a reference to a 2001 train mishap in Ohio involving a runaway train carrying molten phenol. It wasn't nearly so hair-raising in real life, but the element of near-plausibility makes ""Unstoppable"" more compelling. It's a race against time, not against high-tech gadgetry. The train must be stopped before it reaches a curve in Stanton, which will cause it to derail and spew toxic chemicals. The technology that can be brought to bear on the problem is limited. It's a railroad. So this is an old-fashioned action movie, punched up with some doom and gloom and the occasional explosion, but thoroughly enjoyable.",1300924800,,1659,5.010869565217392

Denzel Washington and Chris Pine's characters spend the last half hour of the film trying to be heros and stop the train all by themeselves in their own little train, going backwards. Oh and of course there are dangerous chemicals onboard the runaway train and of course it is heading towards a highly populated city where it will surely run off the track if no one stops it and disintegrate everything in the area. Oh, there's a pointless subplot about how Pine's character has a restraining order and can't see his son and wife and of course Washington's character has a small issue with his two daughters too. I'm pretty sure I covered the entire movie. That really is it. Zero suspense, predictable ending and can't forget the clich&eacute; characters!",1300924800,,832,4.784722222222222

Why was the owner of the railroad company not thrown in prison?

He made a life and death decision based on potential financial losses, not human losses.  The right call would have been to derail the train in the unpopulated area.  He put thousands of lives at risk in order to protect his money.

WE CANNOT ALLOW THESE LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS TO BE MADE BY PRIVATE CORPORATIONS.  WE MUST HAVE ACCOUNTABLE, TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT.

For those of you who don't understand politics the Republican party is pushing an agenda of ""privatization and deregulation"".  That means all services would be run for profit by private corporations with no supervisory government oversight.  That means life and death decisions will be made behind closed doors, with no accountability, and in the interests of profit before humanity.

Do you want government oversight of the police?  Republicans don't.

Do you want government oversight of the military?  Republicans don't.

Do you want government oversight of nuclear power plants?  Republicans don't.

Roads, bridges, environmental protection, medicine, toxic waste management, water treatment, internet, airports, digital voting technology, every service you can possibly think of....Republicans want to turn all these services over to private corporations with no government supervision, regulation, or standards of conduct.

Democrats want GOOD government.  Republicans want NO government.  Why?  Republicans are corrupt lowlifes who want to exploit politics for personal wealth.  They will hurt YOU if it gets more money in their pocket.  This movie is a perfect example.

....and more about the movie

-Shame there was no accountability...the owner should have been thrown in prison.  The Glavin guy should not have been fired but thrown in prison.  The idiot who caused the whole mess should have been thrown in prison instead of ending up in the ""fast food industry"".

-Why was his wife played by a 14 year old girl?  That was gross.

-Denzel cut Chris' lines...don't you just hate that hollywood ego trip garbage?

-Don't Chris Pine's plastic surgery lips just piss you off?

-Fox news is not a legitimate news organization.  It's a mouthpiece for the Republican party.

Pine blends a slightly arrogant streak with the realization that he can learn a lot from the cagey veteran.  The film incorporates the ""up yours"" attitude towards management that audiences will relate to.  Rosario Dawson plays the part of the go-between between management and labor perfectly.  The sustained ""action"" of the train is surprisingly well-maintained throughout the movie.  Kudos to Tony Scott, the director, for another well directed movie and to the editors.

4369835,3,B004FK2MWA,"This movie does indeed roll along like a freight train. Predictable but great action. Predictable but great acting from Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. And the best part: the movie ran at just over 90 minutes breaking from what seems to be Hollywood's latest unwritten law that says movies need to run past the 2-hour mark. Thanks, Tony Scott.

Scott likes the train business I guess and he brought Denzel with him again after they rode&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pelham-1-2-3/dp/B002LMV7Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pelham 1 2 3</a>&nbsp;together back in 2009. And it's funny....Either a major coincidence has occurred or Tony Scott said to Denzel, ""Could you just play the same character that you played in our last movie?"" Come to think of it, I think Denzel has played the same character in his last 20-something movies. Clearly the guy has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Unstoppable was all the way back in 1992's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malcolm-X/dp/B0045D3N3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malcolm X</a>&nbsp;(he played Malcolm X).

I was definitely entertained by Unstoppable. Simple story: A careless accident causes a freight train to go on a runaway path unmanned and at full throttle. Washington and Pine are respectively engineer and conductor in the field who take it upon themselves to come up with a plan to stop the out of control train. And of course Denzel's corporate superiors, government emergency forces and the cops are all idiots (as Hollywood so predictably and consistently casts). Director Scott keeps the movie rolling down the track with some decent suspenseful action as the mild mannered combination of Denzel and Chris Pine attempt to save the day.

All the other characters are equally believable, and special effects don't overpower the story.  The movie looks real, the people act and talk real, and the action is almost constant.

4369841,5,B004FK2MWA,"The cast was right on the money for this movie, from Ethan Suplee as the incompetant ""Dewey"" which he played well, to Rosario Dawson, who has managed to bring a sense of power to her role as a woman placed in charge of a train yard. She doesn't pander to typical stereotypes, folding under a man's decision, but rather brings with her a great deal of intelligence, morality, and character, constantly going for a real solution, inspite of her superiors being completely closed-minded, and uninformed about their actions.

Denzel Washington (Frank), and Chris Pine (Will) were the stars in this thrill ride of a movie. Once things get going, they put everything on the line, including their own lives, to save not only a train, but would-be thousands of lives in the process. Will ends up injuring his leg during their attempt, and Frank braves running along the top of a train traveling 70-80 miles an hour.

You might think to yourself that this seems like an unlikely scenario, but however unlikely it may be, it could potentially happen, and I think the movie captured the idea and was able to inform people just how dangerous something like this could be. One simple mistake leads to a huge train speeding along at unthinkable speeds, with enough kinetic energy to destroy almost anything in it's way, and enough toxic substances to kill many thousands of people.

The pace of the movie started just right, slowly moving along until it hits a geometric curve and moves right into full speed ahead. It is like slamming against the back of your seat as your plane takes off.

All in all I found this to be a great movie, with inspired acting and a great cast.",1300320000,2,1661,4.678082191780822
4369842,1,B004FK2MWA,"Yet another clich-ridden and factually insulting movie from Tony Scott, a director with perhaps one-tenth the integrity and artistry of his brother Ridley. The absurdities of the various methods Scott portrays as attempts to stop the runaway train are little more than an insult to any sort of logic or intelligence, all the more so since it is claimed that the movie is based on a true incident. Just some examples:  if you can get a train engine just ahead of the runaway engine you simply have someone transfer from that engine's rear to the front of the runaway one; or when both trains were on the same track, have Denzel Washington reverse his, let the runaway train catch up to him, and have Chris Pine climb over to it and stop it that way; or if you decide to derail the beast and the mechanism to be used for some reason may be or proves to be unreliable, one single track removed manually or by explosives will do.

But there appears to also be another problem with the movie no one seems to have caught. Twice Scott tries to ramp up the tension with near collisions with oncoming trains that just make it onto a safe siding - the second time after losing at least half of their cars in a collision with the runaway one. On the first occasion the runaway train would be able to pass through the switch despite it being open to the siding - unless the switch is locked in trains moving in the opposite direction will just move the angled tracks back to the normal straightaway configuration and pass along safely. But on the second occasion Washington's train was still moving onto the siding when the runaway train reached the switch. Heavy cars were already on the switched rails at the time, in other words, and it's almost impossible to believe that the runaway train could have simply plowed through and pushed the rails back straight without some debris getting in the way or damaging the rails at some point near the switch. Logically a derailment of the passing train should ensue, and the film should end at that point, instead of going on to the incredible scene of thousands of tons of train angled up on just one rail in the ninety degree curve without completely destroying both the rail and most likely the ancient appearing bridge it's fastened to!

But that's okay, no doubt people who leave their brains at the theater door will be fully entertained. I just hope they remembered to pick their brains up when they left.",1300320000,6,2445,4.56492027334852

Such things as story, character development, and even the laws of physics to a degree are inconsequential.  Despite that though, Unstoppable somehow manages to work regardless.  Washington and Pine are both insanely likeable, the action is wonderful, and the film is surprisingly suspenseful as well.

It's never bad to have Rosario Dawson in your film.  Plus, Kevin Corrigan's in this one.  The story is pretty simple here, and there won't be a lot of surprises.

4369858,2,B004FK2MWA,"""Unstoppable"" was directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson in this story of a half-mile long runaway train that is compared in dialogue to a missile heading towards very populated areas. These characters all dance around the train, but the train itself in all its fire engine red glory is the star. How I wish they had just put more stuff in front of the train for it to destroy...

The movie introduces the characters quickly. Chris Pine is Will, a rookie conductor trying to make ends meet while being separated from his wife and kid after a misunderstanding. Denzel Washington plays Frank, part of the old guard in the train yards and resentful of newbies coming in and taking their jobs. There's a bit of tension but eventually they will begrudgingly respect each other through the upcoming crisis.

Some dimwits eating fast food and rushing their word accidentally set a large train in motion that has failed air brakes and accidentally put itself into gear. In a different light, the director could've played the possessed train with a taste for vengeance card, but instead it focuses on the fact that the doofusses were being morons. Rosario Dawson plays Connie, the woman communicating between all the trains and attempting to avert disaster while being stuck under management's thumb.

Something that really bothers me about Tony Scott films is the shaky, blurry camera work to introduce a movie and make it INTENSE. He did the same thing with another train film, this one underground ""Pelham 123"". It's almost unwatchable. Very predictable. Dan turned to me before it started and asked, ""How much you wanna bet it opens with a sunrise coming over the train yard with a train drifting into view"" and BAM! There it was. Our big bad mean train is so cleverly painted RED so you'll never miss it in any shot. The little tiny train that Frank and Will drive is blue, the same color as Thomas the Tank engine and it's old and has everything against it, but darn-it-all, it's going to be the ""little engine that could"" by the end of this, you can just smell it.

The train's speed starts high and just gets higher. Even when it's going 10mph, it looks like it's going 60 in the opening shots so the challenge Tony Scott has to face is how to make an already ridiculously fast looking train, get FASTER! There are tons of close calls and a cheap teases that children are going to be injured. And ""Unstoppable""? Spoiler alert, it's false advertising. ;-)  Fine for a random high-speed action movie, but you won't really care about the characters, just the train hitting stuff.

Bonus Features:

The Bonus Features are all starring THE TRAIN. In ""The Fastest Track: Unleashing Unstoppable"", Tony Scott discusses his love affair with helicopters, using them, shooting from them and how no one does train movies (except him I guess) and he really loves trains. In ""Derailed: Anatomy of a Scene"", you get to see the behind-the-scenes look at...a really fast train and the stunts that go along with it. Specifically in ""Hanging off the Train: Stunt work"", you see Chris Pine getting pelted with Sugar Puffs five inches away from serious injury. ""On the Rails with the Director and Cast"" is where the cast and Tony Scott stop and talk about how important it was to have such a good story and these ""well-developed"" characters (two of which work at Hooter's) and how that factored into deciding to do the movie. Yeaaaahh. I'm pretty sure it was for the train. ;-) There's another feature on script development, but we know that part wasn't extremely important and audio commentary with director Tony Scott involves him talking about the characters and story, but he really focuses on trains, cars, and helicopters.",1298851200,4,3750,4.795665634674923

4369866,4,B004FK2MWA,"This movie is fun, and showcases the talents of a stable of very well cast actors. I missed the movie in the theater and wasn't sure what to expect. The only problem I had with this movie was that it is practically impossible for a train to run away they way they showed it in the movie. Airbrakes work the opposite way you expect. When an engineer pumps air into the brake line, it RELEASES the brakes on the train. If the hoses were disconnected between the cars, as depicted in the movie, the air would bleed out of the brake lines APPLYING the brakes. The only way for a train to run away the way they showed it in the movie was if all the air hoses were connected, the brake lines charged with air to release the brakes, and then some nobnoggin would have to go back and close the angle cocks on the brake lines on both cars where the hoses were supposedly disconnected, and then and only then, unfasten the brake hoses. Which they didn't show happening. And, even with the brake hoses all connected, without a air pump constantly keeping the air lines charged, the air in the brake line would slowly leak out, eventually applying the brakes.

Conversely, when either of the locomotives caught up to the train, they wouldn't have had to couple onto the runaway to stop it, all they would have had to do was to get close enough for somebody to reach across and lean down and open the angle cock on the air line of the first car. Dangerous but not as risky as trying to couple onto the cars. Once the angle cock was open, the air would bleed out of the brake lines, automatically applying the brakes.

The movie claims to be based on real events, and if this is true, either they didn't show the brakes being ""properly"" misused in the film, or it was based on a story from the steam train days back before they had perfecting the Westinghouse air brake.

I know this movie is based on real-life events, though they were overexemplified in the movie simply because, well it was made to make money for the motion picture industry.  You have 2 morons at the beginning of the movie who look like they belong anywhere but working in a rail yard, especially Ethan Suplee who hops out of the cab of a high-power locomotive attached to a consist of 39 cars while it is in motion, even though his co-worker warns him the air hoses are not attached, rendering the air brakes useless to stop the train!!  Then you flash to a rookie conductor (Chris Pine) and a veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) whom are out on a routine day of hauling cargo.  From there on out it is non-stop action.  I have to admit that some of the scenes were rather ridiculous, if not entertaining and hold-your-breath types, such as the one where the lashup (2 locomotives connected together to haul heavier consists) driven by another veteran engineer (David Warshofsky) derails and explodes after 777 bumps it as it goes into the siding and also where the (what were they thinking?) young Afghanistan veteran is lowered from the helicopter onto the fast moving locomotive and gets knocked off when 777 hits the lashup hard.  After that it is nuts with the drama and suspense as Pine and Washington try to speed up and couple their lone locomotive to a 41-unit train with 2 much more powerful locomotives in full throttle, how did they ever think they were going to be able to stop a 70-plus mph train with one older, well-used locomotive?  Rosario Dawson did lend a very good performance in her role as yardmaster and communicating and connecting with Pine and Washington during their daring chase.

I will admit I was on the edge of my seat in the theater when this was released in November and eagerly awaited the DVD release, though I have to admit it isn't quite as riveting on a TV screen as it is in a theater.  The ending was a bit of a letdown as it just simply ended and with no air brakes I don't see how Chris Pine could have braked that 75-mph train in a very short distance.  The one nice plus is he reunited with his estranged wife and child.  Guess it takes a near death tragedy to bring a couple back together...

All in all, a great movie worth watching for a thrill ride.  Think I saw it 4 times in the theater.",1298505600,,2560,4.38477801268499
4369869,5,B004FK2MWA,"I really liked this movie.  Not overloaded with filler and CG, and it has a pretty good story line.",1298505600,,99,4.2105263157894735
4369870,5,B004FK2MWA,"This is a taut and suspenseful action thriller with excellent lead performances from Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson.

Based on a true incident, the film tells the tale of a runaway freight train that threatens to derail around a curve in Stanton, PA, spewing its load of toxic chemicals on the surrounding community.

Bucking the unfortunate trend of DVDs packing minimal extras, this disc includes both a commentary by director Tony Scott as well as an informative ""making-of"" featurette that impresses the viewer with the scope of the production and the director's insistence on shooting as much as possible ""in the camera"" -- i.e. no CGI effects.

Though stopping the runaway train is the primary story here, the vet engineer and rookie conductor played by Washington and Pine have credible back stories that give their relationship an additional edge.  Dawson lends strong support as the dispatcher who is trying to keep track of the situation as it spins out of control due to an arrogant and inept engineer and bad calls by a bottom-line-driven railroad exec.

Action thriller fans will be munching fistfuls of popcorn as the runaway train picks up speed, and fans of good acting will appreciate the star turns of the leads.

Highly recommended.",1298505600,,1270,5.052631578947368
4369871,5,B004FK2MWA,"I not only like Chris Pine ever since I saw him in Star Trek, but Denzel Washington has put on some good performances too as well. I also have a soft spot for Nathan Suplee from his days on My Name Is Earl. I've worked in the industrial realm and can see something like this happening. Mr. Scott weaves a story that makes it just plausible enough that it could actually happen and since it was inspired by true events, well... Whatever plot holes and flaws in logic there may be if you look too close, I never noticed. I was enjoying myself too much.

The movie starts slowly, at least to me it does, but that is kind of the point. It needs to build up to the real frantic climax. As things unfold, we learn bits and pieces about some of the characters, mainly Denzel and Chris's. One is on the verge of forced retirement while the other is on his umpteenth job. As the movie unfolds and things get dicey, they inevitably come to like and respect each other. Predictable, but so what? It still makes for a great and fun ride.

The magnificent machines are big stars in this movie also. Those trains are powerful and almost unstoppable beasts and they take a lot of finesse to tame, despite what most people might think. I have a lot of respect for the real train engineers. I'm sure many of them have cringed at some of the scenes in this movie, but I didn't see their image really tarnished except by Nathan Suplee's screw-up which was the whole reason for the movie. Then again, as I said earlier, this has happened before and it's likely to happen again somewhere.

I should also mention Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple as supporting characters. They helped make things interesting on the sidelines.

This movie was a fun ride and I could watch again in a few months. Highly recommended.",1298505600,,1788,4.425531914893617
4369872,3,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable is indeed very stoppable, and blessedly so; hitting pause while going to get a beer has rarely felt like such a relief. The first hour is so full of modern film cliches that it was just plain annoying:

-Shaky Hand-Cam TM that's supposed to make you feel excited but just makes you feel ill
-pointlessly sudden close-ups that achieve the same effect as the shaky hand-cam
-unbelievably manipulative music that tells you what you're supposed to feel just before you could ever actually feel it from what's on screen...and way louder than the dialogue so you have to lunge for the remote or have your eardrums assaulted
-brief and all-too-standard character bios that reveal the same tired character types, especially the young married couple on the rocks (gee, all they need is a good disaster to rekindle their love!)
-product placement galore (like we don't get enough Faux News in ""reality"" these days?)
-etc etc

Scott and Denzel hit a home run with Man On Fire but have since tried variations on that pattern to ever-less success, and Unstoppable is so formulaic that these two seem to be on auto-pilot. Yes, it's based on a true story, but there are so many hackneyed tropes here that it might as well be entirely fake, I mean fictional.

[Spoilers] The train literally turns the magic final curve on half its wheels?! Are you kidding? Why not have Superman come down and set it straight while you're at it? Ridiculous. Either you're going for realism, or you're not. Which is it?

We're told the train is going 71 mph and is 10 miles from the next Big Event...and then it takes 20 minutes to get there, with no apparent back-time shots, etc. What, we can't do math?

The tv helicopter hovers over the entire ride and almost hits the rescue chopper...and not one person ever mentions the danger or stupidity of that? Come on.

Denzel is just getting lazy, or maybe he has no acting chops any more, or something, because every role he takes seems to require less and less thought and feeling, with the script supplying all the dramatic movement while DW just grimaces and looks fully committed to whatever crazy stunt he's about to let his stunt double do. Speaking of which, the hopping across trains at 75 mph at 60 years old with nary a hitch? Pull the other one.

Pine is fine but feels like Paul Walker or any other of the new blond pretty boys who think scowling equals acting. Ditto most of the other actors here: bland. It just never felt right or real, but instead like a movie hyping itself at every turn.

The final 20 minutes are better than the rest, but not by much. The final screen shot showing that Denzel's character got his full pension back is so funny it's a joke. The guy saves the entire company and gets a pat on the back? Believable, but for the movie to show it as some sort of justice is, like so much of this predictable Hollywood tripe, self-defeating.

I love popcorn movies, and this is surely one, but both the director and star can do SO much better. Too bad they're just going for the easy money now.

Speaking of which, this blu-ray package is a rip-off at 39, or even 20. Who needs a BD hi-def picture for a movie purposely shot extra-grainy and shaky to get that ""real feel""? Nobody. This blu-ray is a waste of money, and the extras are also on the dvd, so get that if you must, but better yet just rent this, or best yet, watch any of a thousand better popcorn action thrillers before you pop this one in the player. It's only Unstoppable if you let it get started...and even then that beer break will be such a relief. You might just want to stay in the kitchen and turn on the radio.",1298332800,4,3639,4.491679273827534

(1.) Nice train graphics - ahhh, the power of computational software.
Negatives:
(1.) Really bad script in which the writers must have spent their entire lives at Hollywood Senior High; adjacent pools and clubs. Obviously from the dialogue and human interactions they never had a blue collar working job or perhaps even seen one (except, maybe, the service industry).
(2.) Really miscast actors who must have watched old movies to figure out how to play their roles. Yes, I know what I'm talking about because I've had high school summer jobs working blue collar including a rail yard which is orders of magnitude more than either the writers or actors.
(3.) The personal interludes to, supposedly, develop the human character side of the story so that it's just not an action runaway train flick seemed plastically robotic and really badly artificially scripted. The acting was so artificial I thought I was watching plastic toys on display at KMart.

4369874,3,B004FK2MWA,"There was a 1986 film called RUNAWAY TRAIN with Jon Voight. There was the exciting 1974 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. There was the not-too-exciting 2009 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 with Denzel Washington. Everybody I knew who had seen the original was convinced it was going to suck, and it did. Nevertheless, Tony Scott liked his own work in PELHAM 1 2 3 so much that he immediately rehashed it with UNSTOPPABLE, another Denzel Washington movie. Denzel, who used to do Oscar-caliber work such as PHILADELPHIA and MALCOLM X, is definitely on the downside of the hill and is in danger of being typecast as Choo-Choo Charlie. In PELHAM 1 2 3, he played the emotionally conflicted subway dispatcher. Here, he plays an emotionally conflicted locomotive engineer.

UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a freight train loaded with hazmat cars that somehow gets away from the railmen and, engineerless, goes careening through rural Pennsylvania toward a large city. If the train derails in said large city, it will be the American Chernobyl. While this disaster is hanging over their heads, three quarters of everybody in Pennsylvania is standing around near the tracks watching and waiting for the train to derail. In real life, the mass evacuation spoken of in the film would have been a panic-stricken mass evacuation, not an excuse for a Statewide block party. Denzel is the engineer of the lone locomotive that is chasing the runaway train in order to hook up and possibly bring the thing to a halt safely. Unfortunately, UNSTOPPABLE never really gets moving; despite the suspenseful premise, the film lacks any real suspense since it is so full of cliches and set-piece action that we know how the film is going to end just as soon as it starts.

There are no surprises in UNSTOPPABLE. We've seen it all before, and although it's worth a watch, it's not really as ""unstoppable"" as it is ""totally forgettable.""",1298246400,,1963,4.821958456973293

4369882,5,B004FK2MWA,"UNSTOPPABLE is a thriller about a runaway freight train hauling lethal cargo, hurtling toward unspeakable tragedy. The action starts a few minutes into the film and doesn't stop for 1 hour and 38 minutes later when you finally exhale.

Denzel Washington is classic in the film; a twenty-eight year veteran engineer with a quick wit and cool hand on the throttle. There are some well-worn themes; hard-working union members against incompetent corporate thugs; rough-hewn rail hands vs the mean old railroad man; know-nothing rookies vs experienced veterans; misunderstood husband with a quick temper but good heart; etc. Even these are not so tedious as to prevent enjoyment.

It is interesting that a runaway train story, replete with cliche' screenwriting and threadbare liberal stereotypes could be so much fun. It is an hour and a half of non-stop entertainment; groans, laughs, intakes of breath, raucous cheering. This is a suspenseful action film, fraught with tension and excitement. You may find yourself on the edge of your seat and cheering aloud.

PG-13 for strong language.",1297900800,3,1086,5.265895953757226
4369883,4,B004FK2MWA,"UNSTOPPABLE is a genre film - minimal story/lots of action - and as such it succeeds very well.  Probably for audience breathing time the story line introduces some psychological exchanges between the two characters - in formation about their family lives that seem oddly out of place with all the terror on the screen - and that aspect of the film adds some human drama that makes the final product more credible: it is, actually based on a true story. The fact that veteran action flick creators - writer Mark Bombeck and director Tony Scott - are 'on board' this project assures the popularity quotient.

Frank (Denzel Washington) is an aging soon to be retired train engineer and is joined by a young, emotionally distracted but well-trained new conductor Will (Chris Pine) who are out on what seems to be a routine run in Pennsylvania.  They banter caustically until hearing that there is a full speed runaway train (engineer Dewey - Ethan Suplee - left his position in the train with the throttle on) that happens to be carrying toxic chemicals. Should the train proceed with its runaway course many lives could be endangered when the train reaches a critical curve in the tracts in Stanton , PA.  Frank decides the only way to stop the train would be to go in reverse and lock onto the back of the train, putting on the brakes to slow the runaway train.  Frank and Will decide to brave the elements and attempt this near impossible task, much against the advice of the chief Galvin (Kevin Dunn) but with the daring go ahead signal form the men's immediate boss Connie (Rosario Dawson).  During this breakneck chase Will relates his fragile marriage to a wife (Jessy Schram) who refuses to return or accept his calls and Frank confides in Will that his wife died a few years ago form cancer, leaving his the sole parent for his two daughters (Elizabeth Mathis and Meagan Tandy): they both have family deadlines to meet that very day.  How the two not only become friends but allies in heroic effort to stop the incipient tragedy makes of the ending of the film.

Washington and Pine make fine acting partners and the off the tracks work by Dawson and Dunn and the other small parts are well executed.  The special effects are excellent.  The fact that seemingly far-fetched story is true adds to the appreciation of the film.  This is a solid action flick with some standout performances.

4369884,1,B004FK2MWA,"The only good thing about this movie is Denzel Washington's acting which is always outstanding. But even he couldn't salvage a movie so cliche'd as to defy description. I can usually ignore gross errors in films or action liberties but this movie went way beyond what I could tolerate.

If it were advertised as a pure entertainment/over the top action/adventure movie then I would have ignored its failures but not when it is supposed to be a reality based disaster movie. At the beginning of the movie, it says it is based on a true story! If this movie was really based on a true story then woe is us because our train system is being run by idiots.

If you know nothing about trains, cars, trucks, diesel fuel, etc and can ignore some serious stupidity then you might like this movie. It definitely has a lot of action and tension. It would be a good movie for kids as there is nothing bad in the movie, no swearing, no sex, no violence and it has heroes, lots of action and bad guys.

On the other hand, ignore the following if you don't want to know what happens in the movie although the outcome should be obvious.

The fundamental problem is that the movie ignores the obvious and does so repeatedly. They initially try to catch the runaway with a pickup truck that can run on rails (no problem with that as it is a common railroad vehicle). But it fails. And nobody thinks to put one in front going same speed then slow down until the runaway catches up and transfer someone to the runaway?

Instead they use a helicopter to attempt to land a person on the runaway train but it fails also, then they stop trying? If you've got a train with an extremely toxic load, wouldn't you try and try until you succeeded? The alternative is massive destruction and loss of life, yet in the movie they only tried once. And you don't need a railroad expert either so you could use almost anyone.

However, they do put another train (two locomotives) in front but with only one person on board and which slows down to catch the runaway train but why didn't they try to have someone then go from that train to the runaway? But of course this train crashes and the operator gets killed. Then they won't switch the train onto a siding to derail it but instead use some gimmicky Derailer that of course doesn't work either. Then they have a single locomotive (operated by Washington and Pine) which amazingly is able to slow down the runaway (which has two locomotives)! The ""Incredible Plan to Stop the Train"" was nothing more than catching it, hooking up and using the single locomotive to slow it down. Guess what? It doesn't work. They do eventually manage to stop the runaway and amazingly it stops on a dime even though all the brakes for the other cars are disconnected?

And toss in a train full of kids (got to have kids in danger to add to the excitement). And the money grubbing executives who only care about the dollar loss. And the government official who just happens to be there (nice coincidence) and who tells a 28 year railroad veteran how to stop the runaway.

Let me sum up the movie by answering five questions for you.

Will the runaway train be stopped?  (yes)
Will any significant characters perish?  (no)
Will there be lots of hand-wringing and moments in which corporate leaders are shown to be fools?  (yes)
Will there be lots of bravado banter? You know, that kind of humorous, sarcastic, jovial ""well gosh, look at the peril we're in"" chatter?  (yes)
Will there be moments of near catastrophe that will cause spectators to raise their fists, cheer, and feel good about being alive?  (yes)
Will there be a heart-warming ending for estranged family members and those who pulled together to avert disaster?  (yes)

And that , in a nutshell, is this film.

Performances are fine.  Editing is rapid-fire.  Direction is workmanlike. Dialogue is uninspired.

4369901,4,B004FK2MWA,"Tony Scott's latest film ""Unstoppable"" is exactly about what the title describes: a runaway freight train with highly toxic materials. Because of several human errors, themselves simple, no one is on board to stop the train, and ""dead man's switch"" is of no use. As Rosario Dawson's yardmaster says, the worst scenario is ""a missile the size of the Chrysler Building."" The only hope to evade the catastrophe is a veteran driver Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and a newly-hired guard Will Colson (Chris Pine).

The story, inspired by the real-life event in 2001 Ohio, is simple, and it works. This is a non-stop ride of action from start to finish. Tony Scott's trademark fast-cut visual style and fast-paced narrative captures the deadly power and speed of the rushing train, greatly supported by the impressive stunt work. To create tension, the film does not rely on CGI effects overused these days. The film shows what it is being ""unstoppable.""

""Unstoppable"" is not without flaws. For all the strong acting from the leading actors, characters (especially those who make wrong decisions) tend to be stereotypical. Action set-pieces are gripping, but I for one prefer less hectic camera work.

Still this is a hugely entertaining film, plenty of action and speed that goes faster and faster as the film's story unfolds. Highly recommended.

Chris Pine says hello to Denzel Washington and that's about all the calmness you're going to get. 90 minutes on the fast track.
 That's why this film deserves 5 stars. A true action movie that will give you the best thrill for your buck.
 Mr. Washington and Mr. Pine work well off each other. Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple brighten up the storyline with some great character portrayals. Mark Bomback has written some great dialogue that's minimal, to the point, and fully understandable. Credit must be given to Tony Scott and Ben Seresin for not going haywire with shaky handheld camera techniques.

4369904,4,B004FK2MWA,"Overview:

Managing freight trains is really an exercise in logistics. The objective is to get goods from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible. Along the route there may be different switches and changeovers that may be encountered. Computers play a major role in the scheduling of trains in order to optimize the use of the rails. Over land, in terms of ton-miles hauled per unit of consumed energy, rail transport is more efficient than other means of transportation.

This film is about a half-mile long freight train that was allowed to run away without its engineer, who was just a bit too careless and too slow. Initially it was thought that it was a 'coaster' - just rolling, but not under power, so they tried an initial interception down the track. But to their surprise, the train as long gone and now moving at a speed approaching 70 miles per hour. To make matters worse, the train has a huge amount of diesel fuel that it is carrying to keep it running, and if that is not bad enough, several of the cars contain explosive, toxic chemicals that are used to make glue.

The Heroes:

The guys who will take on the last effort ot stop this train are:

- Frank (Denzil Washington) a veteran engineer with 18 years experience.
- Will (Chris Pine) a rookie now getting some hands-on training.

There is a little animosity between the two initally, as Frank, sees himself as the old hand that is being phased out, and replaced by an inexperienced novice, with only theoretical training. However, when the crisis arises, they set aside their differences and rise to the challenge.

The Experience:

Watching this movie is a riveting experience. The momentum (mass x velocity) of the trains come across the screen big time. There are close passes and near misses that can make you sweat just watching them. There is a lot of stunt work especially at the ending. You can really get into this movie as the tension continues to build. The end is indeed quite rewarding, and you know that you have been taken to the edge and back again.

Conclusion:

What I like about this movie is the way that it captures the determination and resolve of the human spirit, to risk everything for the safety of others.",1292889600,3,2219,4.6091370558375635
4369905,3,B004FK2MWA,"Upon seeing the previews for this i really wasn't to thrilled, although i'm a big Denzil fan and also Tony Scott who lately has been casting Denzil in about all his films. My favorite of his is definitely ""Man On Fire"" great story, great emotion, and something to watch again and again. Well how does Unstoppable fair amongst Scotts best, well most are saying it's his best in years, i would have to disagree. While the story is kind of fresh with the whole runaway train deal, the plot(story) is thin and has really been done a lot before. New guy on the job(Chris Pine), gets to partner up with Veteran (Denzil Washington) for his first day of training. They exchange some small talk here and there, Denzil bosses him around a bit, Pine gets fed up tells him off by and by. Well once the Train is on its way the chaos starts, its not that it isn't ""somewhat"" tense it just seems like the train is doing all the work and making the excitement while the actors just kind of stand oddly by and watch, which what else can you do?

So does this make for a big blockbuster smash that critics and fans have made it out to be, well no not really. It's a mediocre thrill ride with some good moments, and some moments of predictability. We know the company wants to derail the train but complains it will cost millions for the train company and have some potential deadly environmental effects, so we're pretty sure that won't happen. Its pretty obvious that our boys will figure out someway of stopping the train traveling at an alarming 70mph, which i didn't even know they had that capability. So whats done is done, and it gets done, i won't say how for those who haven't seen it, but in seeing the previews who do you think are the hero's at the end of the day. Pretty easy to guess. There are some good effects and the train is intimidating to watch as it has close calls with kids on a passing train, towns, plows into cars and does cause some other means of chaos. I was actually wanting more death and destruction, but hey its PG-13 and pretty plausible. So it falls somewhere in between good and ok, there is never a dull moment in the short 1:38 minutes of the film, i will give it that.

a) Why do these movies always have to have some annoying 'troubled family life' subplot playing in the background? And it's always the working stiff, lower/middle class young couple in the midst of a seperation. The woman, with a child of course, always has that semi-stressed out look about her.  Of course at the end of the movie they all reunite happily ever after.
b) The obligatory heliocopter chase scenes. What were all those TV news choppers flying around the runaway train?  You mean the police could not keep them away? There they were complicating all the rescue efforts and no one tried stopping them?
c) Washington, playing a guy in his advanced middle age, is able to hop effortlessly across the tops of speeding railroad cars like a cat?
d) And of course lets never leave out the villains as paunchy, golf-playing, heartless white guys. Heaven forbid that they should be portrayed as capable and caring. That would be politically incorrect. And the guy who loses the train in the first place? An overweight white guy of course. And the guy (Ned) who helps rescue the train at the end? He's a loud-mouthed, grandstander.  Because we have to reserve the heros for the minority roles...

4369911,3,B004FK2MWA,"Okay, let me describe Unstoppable. The plot is basic, the acting is secondary, and the whole semi-boring idea of a train on the loose kept me away from seeing Unstoppable in theaters until two weeks after its release. I watched it with a few of my relatives in town for Thanksgiving and everyone said that they enjoyed it, but it's one of those you can easily forget as soon as you make your way from the theater to your car. There will be little to no discussions afterwards, other than saying it was entertaining. I've seen plenty of movies where that alone is not a bad thing, though most don't have Denzel Washington in the lead role and cost over 100 million dollars. Denzel and Chris ""Captain Kirk"" Pine do share a couple of moments of good chemistry, on top of likeable performances. There are also some nice realistic action sequences mixed in with genuine moments of suspense. I'm going back and forth on a three or four star rating, but I think I'll have to take off a star for the sheer lack of depth. Still a fun ride worth catching.",1290729600,4,1045,4.447916666666667
4369912,5,B004FK2MWA,"Okay, never mind that you've seen the plot before; this is a fun,action filled movie that at times had me gripping my husband's hands tight enough to hurt. The premise is almost cliche, although it is loosely based on an actual incident. Due to the incompetence of two railyard workers, a train carrying toxic materials takes off without an engineer and heads for a densely populated area of Pennsylvania. If not stopped, it could kill tens of thousands of people.

The two main characters are played very ably by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Washington plays an experienced conductor who has been pink-slipped by the RR company. Pine plays a brash young, newly trained conductor who still has a lot to learn, and he doesn't actually appreciate Washington's character pointing it out every time he goofs up.

Okay, forget that you know the two characters will develop a mutual respect and work together to heroically stop the runaway train, thereby saving Washington's job with the RR company. This is a fun movie to watch and the suspense is palpable. Nor does it pull all the expected cliche strings- it does miss a few here and there. It was a fun movie to watch and even though I knew how it was going to end, the suspense in seeing how, exactly, they stopped the train kept me on the edge of my seat.",1290729600,16,1310,4.642241379310345
4369913,5,B004FK2MWA,"Chris Pine has really become quite the actor. I saw him first as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, and since then, I have gone back to watch a couple of his earlier movies along with the lower-budget Sci-Fi flick, ""Carriers."" In ""Unstoppable,"" he really turns on the heat, and side-by-side with good ol' Denzel, he shines.

Here was a movie that, while viewing the trailers, I was thinking, ""Really? An entire movie about a runaway train?"" Well, the resounding answer is, ""YES!"" An excellent back-story, along with a perfect amount of character-building to get us to really like these people, made for a foundation on which to build one heck of an over-the-top mountain of suspense! In addition to Chris, Denzel Washington was excellent, as always, and the rest of the acting crew, especially Rosario Dawson, were perfectly cast and on top of their game as well. The main character was more than just a menace, though, it was downright deadly...THE TRAIN!

A review I read on another site said that this movie started slow, but by the time Chris and Denzel's characters got in on the action it was non-stop fun. Well, I'm here to tell you that this movie gets rolling within the first five minutes...literally...rolling. The action and suspense builds by leaps and bounds, second-by-second. On more than one occasion, ""Unstoppable"" gets you to hold your breath in anticipation of the next scene, or simply steals it altogether. This one comes highly recommended.

I've been waiting for a really good runaway train movie since...well, ""Runaway Train,"" and it's finally here.

4369915,3,B004FK2MWA,"Unstoppable is kind of like a sports movie. If you've seen the ads, you know it's about a runaway train and two men who chase after it. You know the movie can only end one of two ways - either the men stop the train and all is well, or the train derails and devastates. So for just over an hour and a half, this movie needs to keep our attention despite the ending being completely predictable. The cast is led by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, with Rosario Dawson also turning in a nice supporting performance. These cast members are really playing second fiddle to the train though, as that's what we all really want to see.

The movie is loosely based on a true story, but you quickly can tell how loosely by all of the ""close calls"" the train has with hitting stuff. There is a group of students on a train headed towards the runaway train. There are a couple of nervous horses on the tracks. These instances were a little cheap and unrealistic. It's not to say that there wouldn't be close calls in this type of situation, but the overacting of those involved in these situations was silly. Also, some of the instances aren't resolved on screen, just in a passing comment like ""Oh, that van was moved by the way."" My other problem has to do with the ending. I won't spoil it, but let's just say if you really think about it, it's kind of unrealistic.

On the plus side, despite being predictable and silly at times, the movie isn't slow. They quickly tell the story and then end the movie - there isn't a single wasted minute. I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. It's very entertaining, and it is quite fun.

4369916,4,B004FK2MWA,"Tony Scott's ""Unstoppable"" is a nail biting, heart pounding, relentlessly exciting film. It takes most of the reliable hallmarks of the action picture - death defying stunts, crashes, explosions - and strips them to the bare essentials. There's no posturing, no big muscles and machine guns, no pompous dialogue, no padding of any kind. There's only a raw, primal adrenaline rush. The result is a film so taut and gripping that you're liable to lose the feeling in your hands from clenching the armrests on your theater's chair. It winds itself up at the start and keeps on winding until the spring is ready to break loose; at the end of it all, when the tension is finally released, you will breathe a sigh of relief ... and then want to experience it all over again. It's kind of like riding a roller coaster.

This film represents a purer, healthier attitude towards the action film. It's great entertainment, yes, but it also has both a brain and a heart at work. Rather than assault us with bursts of noise and flashes of light, we're pushed into a genuinely frightening scenario and dragged along with nothing but the hope that it will somehow turn out all right. We're actually made to feel something. Better still, we're made to care about the characters, who aren't disposable war-mongering typecasts but ordinary people thrust into an extraordinary situation. If convention dictates that the key players will become heroes, at least I can take comfort in knowing that this time around, they actually earn that distinction. And no, I don't care that the film is in all likelihood a gross exaggeration of real life events - I wanted to be thrilled, and thrilled I was.

""Unstoppable"" stars Denzel Washington and Chris Pine as a pair of railroad workers. The former is Frank Barnes, a long time engineer for the Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad. The latter is Will Colson, a rookie conductor. They hit it off like oil and water, Frank and his co-workers believing that Will was hired strictly because of family connections to the union. Despite their differences, they're assigned to work a locomotive together. Frank makes it clear, perhaps a little too strenuously, that Will should ask about something if he doesn't know what to do. Will's personal problems continuously distract him throughout the day; he takes calls he shouldn't be taking, and eventually, he attaches their locomotive to too many trains. Things just don't seem to be going well.

And it will only get worse. At another station, a lazy hostler (Ethan Suplee) fails to connect an air hose on a train that's scheduled to be moved, preventing the air brakes from working. He doesn't think this will be a problem; he'll simply hook them up after parking the train on another track. Unfortunately, the switch up ahead is not set for the right track, and when he jumps off the main engine to fix it - a highly frowned upon maneuver - the improperly set throttle shifts on its own, speeding up the train to the point that he can no longer get back on. Not only is the train unmanned, it's now on the coasting faster and faster along mainline. Will and Frank are also on the mainline. And they're going in the opposite direction.

Keeping tabs on the escalating situation is yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), who quickly learns that the some of the tanks on the runaway train are carrying a highly hazardous material. She and a number of other dispatchers work tirelessly to get all opposing traffic onto sidings, and this includes a train full of children on a field trip. They begin rallying the state police in the hopes that they can secure guard crossings in various cities. Connie also has to fight an uphill battle with her superior, Oscar Galvin (Kevin Dunn), a corporate typecast unwilling to entertain her idea of derailing the train in lightly populated farmland. Derailing the train would cost the company millions of dollars, and as we all know, money is more important than safety.

I will now refrain from going into detail, since that would ruin the suspense. I will only say that Frank and Will get wind of the situation and decide to stop the runaway train on their own. I will also say that, from here, the film becomes increasingly nerve wracking. Many action movies are about as predictable as a Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland backyard musical; with ""Unstoppable,"" there's no telling where it might go. The uncertainty, the sheer anticipation, is so palpable that you may lose your breath from gasping so much.

Action films made as well as ""Unstoppable"" have to be treasured, for they show that some filmmakers want to do more than merely exhilarate the audience; they also want to prove that even films about runaway trains can be smart, stylish, and powerful. Watching this film, it's obvious that serious thought went into the plot and the characters. Serious thought must have gone into casting as well, for everyone involved lends believable, engaging performances. Rosario Dawson in particular is especially good, giving her character just the right balance of professional backbone and personal concern. But most of the credit must be given to Mark Bomback for his convincing screenplay, Chris Lebenzon and Robert Duffy for their editing, and everyone who contributed to stunt work, special effects, and sound. They remembered what an action film is supposed to be.",1290124800,5,5374,4.87417943107221

The race against the clock train chase is a great thrill ride if you are in the mood for this type of movie.  It kept the audience spellbound.

4369919,4,B004FK2MWA,"I like all sorts of movies for all sorts of reasons. From the trash to the treasures, I'll give it a shot to show me what it's got. And I don't care as much if someone likes or doesn't like a particular film as much as I care why they like or don't like it. You can't put a film like ""Independence Day"" in the same category as ""The Seven Samurai"" but that doesn't keep me from viewing either repeatedly. Each film needs to know what it's looking to do and each needs to succeed in its own right.

Tony Scott is a seasoned director. He usually exercises great authority over his projects and ""Unstoppable"" is no exception. This is just a way cool flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it. A runaway train, loaded with toxic goo and explosive goo, is barreling down the tracks and it's going to make an awful mess of things unless our heroes save the day.

I never thought much one way or the other about what goes on in a train yard. This gave me a real eye opener on that count. I got to know about trains, routing, switching, union politics and a lot more. The viewer gets a good sense about how involved it all is. It's set in Southern Pennsylvania in late autumn. Again, Scott does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of people and place. You feel like you're there.

The characters are good. The action is relieved by scenes of the two leads getting buddy buddy with each other, so you have a reason to care about them. Rosario Dawson is always a treat for the eyes and she has a good roll here. A note on this. The main three actors all need to do their thing in very confined spaces. Washington and Pine are in the locomotive for most of the movie and Dawson is in her office. These actors have to deliver most of their lines sitting down. If that's not a testament to their abilities I don't know what is.

The action is good and it's smart. The writers did their due diligence on the tech stuff so the viewer gets the whys and wherefores on the gravity of the situation. There is a logical progression to the things that happen. And as they unfold I found myself getting more and more involved. It draws you in and doesn't let go.

Is this the best movie ever made? No. But it delivers the goods in spades. If you're at all disposed toward this sort of thing, spend your money at the box office. It's a bit loud (maybe more than a bit) but seeing it on the big screen is the way to go.",1289779200,5,2421,4.131634819532909

I felt like I was in the movie for the most part and was on the edge of my seat. The movie gave me the rush I always hope for and do not get enough of at the movie theater.
I do not feel the need to give any plot synopsis on this movie since the commercial  or trailer show's you everything you need to know. Chris Pine is really good in his role as he is in the other two roles I have seen him in (Carriers and Star Trek 2009).
Denzel Washington is as always top notch and his role must of been written with him in mind.
See this movie it really is Unstoppable.",1289779200,3,736,3.8421052631578947
