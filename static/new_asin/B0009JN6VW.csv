2295549,5,B0009JN6VW,I Loved it. For once a video on watergardening that kept the installation process easy. After watching this watergarden video it makes me feel like even I could install a pond. I suggest it to anyone who is interested in watergardening. Also it nice to see a younger man with great thighs installing the pond instead of the usual ninty year old. Keep up the great work on watergardening.,989539200,,387,4.6231884057971016
8061998,5,B0009JN6VW,"Pond's eponymous record represents the pinnacle of the Portland indie rock sound of the 90's. In those days, the Northwest (USA) music scene was dominated by the emergence of Seattle and the ""Grunge"" sound. Portland (a much smaller, bohemian city about hours south of Seattle) had only a few clubs that catered to local rock and punk bands, but a budding music scene was budding nonetheless.

Pond was Portland's great hope during that era (although Heatmiser would go on to have the most impact of the bands from that era, thanks to the solo work of their leader Elliot Smith), and they capture the exuberant, noise-laden, ""weird-but-way-too-catchy"" NW pop sound that lurked out of Seattle's stubbly shadow (and wanted little to do with it).

This is the soundtrack for the Portland that was just before every band in America moved here and painted it in to Portlandia.",1384819200,4,870,4.91156462585034
8062001,2,B0009JN6VW,this mmovie shows this group of friends go to a pond and strip and swim and nothing else dose not show any love interest and has a music that maakes you want to sleep rather than watching the rest it is not worth the amount for shipping  plus the coverlet it is hotter than  the movie it self,1183766400,,292,4.017241379310345
8062002,1,B0009JN6VW,"I purchased this movie believing that it would be of some nice eye candy. As it turned out, it was completely boring, nothing simulating at all. There were two guys that were hott out of the 5 of them, but still, nothing exciting on the screen that would make me want to continue to watch. I believe, if I feel embarassed to watch the scene, then it's good. Then it's expressing the correct feel for a sex scene. These immitations of horse play were just boring and unappealing. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie. Save your money.",1158624000,7,535,4.525773195876289
8062003,1,B0009JN6VW,"This doesn't look as having been shot in 1996! One can guess either the use of a primitive VHS camera, or perhaps a better one, whose material has been miserably transferred to DVD. With my SONY Handycam I an reach 10 times better results. AMAZON should warn customers on the inferior quality of this product. We are in the 21st Century now and even porn producing companies supply better material. A pity for the good models and good intentions of the producers.",1144022400,10,463,4.658536585365853
