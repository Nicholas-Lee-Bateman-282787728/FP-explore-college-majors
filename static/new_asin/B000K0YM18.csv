2680981,4,B000K0YM18,"...this set should have included FIEND WITHOUT A FACE instead of THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE. It was made at the same time as the other three films by the same British production team (Richard Gordon/Amalgamated Productions), it also features Marshall Thompson making it a perfect companion piece to FIRST MAN INTO SPACE, and Criterion has already released it as a single so it would simply have to be repackaged. I have fond memories of ATOMIC SUBMARINE from my childhood but stylistically and thematically it really doesn't belong here and should have been released as a single. It would be even better if Criterion gave Alex Gordon (VOODOO WOMAN, THE SHE CREATURE) his own box set.

Having gotten my preference out of the way, let me say that ATOMIC SUBMARINE has never looked better while the other three are virtually the same as the now out-of-print Image Entertainment editions from several years ago (see my Listmania list). Both of the Karloff vehicles are personal favorites of mine even though they really aren't that scary. However they are very atmospheric especially for 1950's b/w horror films. In fact they are British reworkings of Val Lewton's THE BODY SNATCHER and BEDLAM. The real treat is watching Boris at age 70 still giving it his all (which in STRANGLER is quite a lot) and there is the added bonus of a young Christopher Lee in CORRIDORS. The Marshall Thompson FIRST MAN INTO SPACE lacks the thrills of FIEND WITHOUT A FACE but is not without its moments although it's not up to the QUATERMASS XPERIMENT which it closely resembles. The supplementary features are plentiful and the packaging is typically solid although the artwork is rather curious. I'm not quite sure why Criterion chose to release this group of films but I'm glad they did if for no other reason than to draw attention to them.",1169424000,17,1815,4.854838709677419
2680982,2,B000K0YM18,"If you come to this set thinking that Criterion will never let you down and these films must be great ""examples of the genre,"" think again. I can only imagine that someone at the company just picked some titles from a list without knowing anything about the films. ""Let's do a horror/sci fi collection, groovy. Oh, this one has blood in the title and has Boris Karloff, put that one in. ""Atomic Submarine?"" that must be good... etc.
The thing is, even for diehard fans of bad 50s sci fi and horror (like myself) these are hardly the bees' knees... though diehard Karloff and Arthur Franz fans may differ. If you are a newbie to the genre, a slumming art house cineaste who samples all Criterion fare, or want to kickstart a horror collection, this might be a good first dip, as things will only pick up from here. Granted I haven't seen some of these films in years (more than once was enough) and they may be better once Criterion polishes them up real nice... I probably have no right to judge it with two stars, but amazon makes you put up something, and I'm mad that Criterion wasted so much effort on these film when they could have dug up some real gems long neglected by DVD, like VOODOO MAN, THE GIANT CLAW, NOT OF THIS EARTH (1957), IT CONQUERED THE WORLD and if you are going to release movies that are ALREADY out on DVD (like Corridors and Submarine) why not do something interesting, like ROBOT MONSTER and CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON in original 3-D?? Criterion could include good glasses, do it up right, and become the patron saints of junk cinema junkies the world over. Instead... zzzzzzz city.",1169078400,14,1606,4.484641638225256
2680983,2,B000K0YM18,"Okay, maybe turkeys is going too far.  But none of these films are classics.  Criterion, as others have noted, is a fabulous company in terms of producing restored, pristine DVD versions of films.  However, these films are not classics, and are for Karloffians and collectors only.  Me?  I'm both.

I run the video room for a local science fiction convention, so I'll claim a tiny bit of authority here.  I would not show any of these films, although I'd watch them at home.  None are as good as ""Fiend Without a Face"", mentioned in another review in this section, and that one was not quite a classic, either.

Both Karloff films are from his older age.  The Haunted Strangler is probably Karloff's better film, and gives him a chance to contort up his face a bit and show some acting chops.  Corridors of Blood is just ok.  Neither film is particularly scarey or suspensefull, although both do have their moments.  Again, both films are of definite interest to those of us who love Karloff.  Others should beware.

The Atomic Submarine has some atmosphere, but otherwise, watch out.  The effects are cheesy, even for the time.  Not a lot of money was spent on this one.  As for First Man Into Space, you should have some Scotch before trying that one.  It's slow going, and the effects are even less impressive.

Anyone looking for something along the lines of these films that is better, nifty even, should consider the earlier Karloff film, The Body Snatchers, part of his Val Lewton period.  And in terms of the sf Marshall Thompson films, you'd be much better off with Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers.",1168732800,9,1604,4.6571428571428575
2680984,4,B000K0YM18,"You know, the Criterion Collection has long been a leader in providing classic films in the best possible condition, first on laserdisc and later on DVD.  And when it comes to film restoration, they're certainly among the best companies out there.

And yet, it is my feeling that the company is largely unknown outside a relatively small but dedicated group of film enthusiasts, whose passion for the art of cinema equals that of Criterion.  Well, that, plus the fact that the company has largely focused their attention on foreign films that the mainstream moviegoing public has never heard of.  Sure, there have been exceptions, such as their first-class Hitchock releases (Notorious, Spellbound, Rebecca and a few others); bona-fide classics like Spartacus, the Stones' Gimme Shelter; and a few oddball modern choices: The Royal Tennenbaums, Armageddon (?), The Rock (??).

Which is why I was so happy to find a couple of cult sci-fi films in their catalog a few years back.  Both the original version of The Blob (1958), and the sorely underrated Fiend Without a Face filled me with hope that maybe, just maybe, these folks were capable of something more.  In fact, the trailers for all four of the films in this collection were included as bonus materials on Fiend.

Now, the films themselves: The Haunted Strangler and Corridors of Blood are were vehicles for Boris Karloff, who was in his sixties when they were made.  As he had done many times before (and would continue to do), Karloff plays a mad doctor-type.  Corridors is the better of the two, with a young Christopher Lee in a supporting role as a ruthless killer.  Neither film could really be called ""classic,"" but both are solid, low-budget chillers that fans of Karloff and/or Lee will enjoy.

The Atomic Submarine is more straight sci-fi adventure story, with the title vehicle facing off against an underwater UFO.  Again, this is a ""B"" picture all the way, but it retains some charm in spite of an overuse of newsreel footage.

First Man Into Space treads more familiar territory, as an organism from space inhabits the body of an astronaut.  The thing craves blood, so you can guess what happens next.  Not a bad little film, but probably the least of the bunch.

I have to applaud Criterion for making these films available in pristine condition.  I'm sure there is an audience for more of the same type of films.  The only downfall to this collection is--as with all Criterion discs--the price.",1166832000,36,2468,4.861244019138756
2680985,5,B000K0YM18,"This is an excellent collection of four films, once late night staples, which have fallen into obscurity in recent times. There are two excellent sci-fi flicks and two wonderful Karloff films. As with most Criterion releases, a bit pricey, but collectors and fans alike will find the collection worth while.

ATOMIC SUBMARINE (1959) - Arthur Franz, Dick Foran, Tim Conway and Joi Lansing are a part of a crew of an atomic submarine that is tracking an underwater UFO, which is responsible for the sinking of several ships. They track the saucer to the North Pole, where it is using the magnetic field to replenish itself. They board the saucer and meet its occupant, a hairy octopus-like creature with one huge eye.

CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958) - Karloff is in fine form as Dr. Bolton, a physician experimenting with anesthesia in the 1840s. Basing his mixture on opium, he becomes addicted in the process, which leads to his dismissal from the hospital. Needing money to purchase the supplies necessary to continue his research, he falls in with two grave robbers (Francis DeWolfe and Christopher Lee), signing false death certificates in order to get the money.

FIRST MAN INTO SPACE (1959) - A space rocket recently launched into space crashes to earth, but there is no sign of its pilot. Strange things begin to happen: first cattle are killed for their blood, and later, humans. Investigators discover that the killer is none other than the astronaut himself, deformed by a coating of space dust, except for one eye. His brother, the project's commander (Marshall Thompson), realizes that he is heading back to the base and to the high-altitude chamber that he needs to breathe.

THE HAUNTED STRANGLER (1958) - Another excellent Karloff film with Boris as a writer investigating the execution of a serial killer known as ""The Haymarket Strangler"" 20 years previously. He begins to suspect that the wrong man might have been hanged. However, when he picks up a scalpel used by the murderer, he becomes possessed and begins committing similar murders. The key to the mystery turns out to rest with Karloff himself.",1165968000,43,2115,4.949295774647887
2680990,5,B000K0YM18,"Excellent quality! Crisp and clear. Either you like them or hate them, but these are great childhood memories. It is surprising to me what Criterion chooses  to enhance and release, but these are great choices!  (As was The Blob and Fiend Without A Face). Boris Karloff is wonderful as The Haunted Strangler. Try to get this on sale. You won't be disappointed!",1387584000,,360,4.790322580645161

2680993,5,B000K0YM18,"I bought this four movie compilation in order to get ""The First Man Into Space"", a movie I saw when I was a kid, back in 1959. At the time it scared the bejeepers out of me. The other three movies, ""Atomic Submarine"", ""The Haunted Strangler"" and ""Corridors of Blood"" were pretty much icing on the cake, so to speak. Particularly the last two since they're both Boris Karloff movies. I mean, who doesn't like Karloff?

So far, I've watched the First Man Into Space, not quite as scary now as it was when I was 12, but still a pretty good movie, even after all these years. And I've watched Atomic Submarine, also a fair movie for it's day (1959), but as a 14 year Navy vet, let me tell you there were so many inaccuracies in that movie I had to laugh at a lot of it.

But, if you're a fan of science fiction/horror movies, I would definitely reccomend this set, especially since the only way I could find The First Man Into Space as a single was in a European format, not compatable with the US.",1353715200,,994,4.226315789473684
2680994,5,B000K0YM18,"MONSTERS AND MADMEN is a brilliant quadruple feature for lovers of these two genres. First, there's the Boris Karloff (Frankenstein, Bride Of Frankenstein, Black Sabbath) classic, THE HAUNTED STRANGLER about a novelist (Boris) who becomes obsessed w/ the innocence of a man hanged for a series of murders, only to become a malignant force himself! Karloff is superb, w/ his sympathetic portrayal, complete w/ facial contortions. Next, in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, Karloff returns as a surgeon trying to find a less traumatic / painful way to perform amputations. Unfortunately, his good intentions are counteracted by his own addiction, as well as the unscrupulous people he must deal with. This leads to murder and despair. Watch for an early, captivating role for Christopher Lee (To The Devil A Daughter, The Wicker Man) as the malevolant ""Resurrection Joe"". FIRST MAN INTO SPACE has an astronaut who returns to earth as a killer beast, looking much like a burnt tuna casserole in humanoid form! Marshall Thompson (It The Terror From Beyond Space) does his best to track down and save his friend to little avail. Finally, in THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE, Arthur Franz (Invaders From Mars) and the crew of the Tiger Shark must find the reason behind a number of maritime disasters. Along the way, they encounter a UFO w/ a nasty critter (an octopoid cyclops!) aboard that simply must be terminated. There you have it. If you love the 1950s, horror, sci-fi, or Karloff, then this collection is calling your name! These four films are perfect additions to any H /S-F shelf...",1257033600,2,1561,5.007692307692308

2680996,2,B000K0YM18,"This is an odd package for Criterion, a company better known for foreign films and art house selections packaged with academic commentaries.  It's a good collection of Richard and Alex Gordon features but many viewers, I suspect, will find the packet overpriced.  Of the four features, two are Boris Karloff dramas and two are science fiction adventures.  All are in black and white in good transfers with clear sound and subtitles.

  THE HAUNTED STRANGLER (UK, 1958; aka GRIP OF THE STRANGLER) is a minor classic with Karloff playing a writer who becomes involved in the case histories of a bizarre series of murders.  Karloff's performance, I thought, was strong and the plot inventive without feeling contrived.

  I found CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (UK, 1958) less satisfying.  The highly fictionalized account of the discovery of anesthesia in Britain seemed mechanical to me and a body-snatching subplot felt extraneous and gratuitous. There are nice performances by Karloff and Christopher Lee, however.

  THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE (USA, 1959) follows a crew of frogmen, scientists, and crusty sailors in pursuit of a flying saucer that has been sinking ocean ships.  If it's possible to imagine an sf production spending less on set design than on script development, this is that production, an effort, unfortunately, not good enough to be convincing nor bad enough to evoke the spirit of Ed Wood.  It's amusing the first time through but that's about all.

  FIRST MAN INTO SPACE (USA, 1959) is an sf adventure in the Science Creates a Monster tradition.  A standard space adventure/monster movie is enlivened by some good performances, including an amusing cameo by character actor Roger Delgado.

  Rather than the scholarly audio commentaries that Criterion is known for, chatty conversations between Tom Weaver and producers Richard Gordon or Alex Gordon accompany the films.  I found the commentaries somewhat disappointing, since none of them talks much about these films, but they are full of anecdotes of other productions.  Richard Gordon is especially fond of his work with Karloff who, even in his 70s, was unfailingly hard-working and charming.  Christopher Lee was a very good actor though sometimes difficult to work with.  The only really harsh words are for Tim Burton who slandered the character of Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD and for Eddie Wood himself who ""couldn't direct traffic.""  A low point is the commentary on First Man into Space where Tom Weaver kills time by reading a list of historical events he gathered from the internet.

  Collectors with a passion for 'B' sf adventure and Boris Karloff dramas will enjoy this box set, but those simply looking for a good buy on a classic set of thrilling wonder stories might look elsewhere.  I would strongly recommend the Val Lewton box set that Warner brought out.  It contains excellent transfers of CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and other Lewton classics, with very good commentaries (though not on all the films).  Universal has also produced fine collections of DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, THE WOLF MAN, THE INVISIBLE MAN, and THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with their immediate sequels. Again, the transfers are very good and each set includes additional material.

  On a scale of 0 to 5, my individual ratings would be (* for the films and c for the commentaries):

  ***/cc  The Haunted Strangler
  */cc  Corridors of Blood
  o/c  The Atomic Submarine
  **/o  First Man into Space",1208476800,10,3459,5.078431372549019
2680997,3,B000K0YM18,"While I found all four movies interesting for their nostalgia factor as well as for the b-movie schlockiness, the price was a bit too steep. The commentary and packaging were top notch, although I would have preferred a more authentic, vintage style artwork. These type movies generally delivered as much in the fun factor for their marketing concepts and over the top advertisements as for the movies themselves. For many viewers the initial interest for these movies upon their theatrical release in the late 50's - early 60's was by way of the small poorly printed drive-in ads in the local newspaper. Some of the original posters and ads are included on the disk as a slide show, but the box cover art and descriptions have been updated with anime style illustrations. Not bad artwork, just not in keeping with the times the movies were originally released. Doesn't really do justice to the movies included within.

Both Karloff movies were groundbreaking for the gore factor and are by and large well acted with decent set design and direction. The 2 sci-fi films also included a bit more gore than usual for the times, although extremely tame by today's standards and are of interest now as rare and forgotten low budget popcorn drive-in fare.

It was enjoyable to re-discover these movies all together in one package and with Criterion's attention to detail and top notch remastering it made it that much more so. But there have been other non-Criterion multi-movie genre box sets that are just as good if not better for about 30-40 dollars less. The Universal Monsters box sets are but just a few examples.

I do have to say though that, unlike many of the other reviewers, I am especially glad that Atomic Submarine was included. Of the four movies, this one piqued my interest the most. While the effects and acting hit the embarrassment scale several times throughout the proceedings, the cumulative impact was high on nostalgia, inducing recollections of late night science fiction theatre on TV.

I recommend this box set, but not at this price. All four movies in this package do a good job of illustrating that memorable movies can be made on a shoe string budget. And all four also have some historical significance in the changing way that graphic violence was being portrayed on the theatre screen. Let's hope Criterion continues bringing us rare low budget genre pictures...if only they could improve the pricepoint.",1175472000,5,2435,4.902912621359223
2680998,3,B000K0YM18,"Among DVD companies, Criterion courts controversy as much as a Great White zeroes in on tasty human limbs leaning off of inflatable rafts. Their name is synonymous for the finest that the digital medium has to offer. A Criterion disc is sure to have the finest possible transfer with a plethora of extras. In countless reviews, any overly loaded disc is given the appellation of ""Criterion worthy.""  Any film on the Criterion label has become shorthand for being the definitive version of that particular film. As such, discriminating viewers usually put off purchasing classic films until Criterion gets their mitts on a particular title.

The question remains -- with so many undisputed classics from major filmmakers in their catalog -- Douglas Sirk, Fassbinder, Pasolini, et al -- why does Criterion, from time to time, choose to produce loaded discs for exceedingly minor films of dubious merit? Excluding a few scattered fans of this title, does the world really need a definitive version of Fiend Without A Face (1956)? A dreary black-and-white low-budget shock show, Face's chief claim to fame is some stop-motion animated brains that ""blow up real good"" when shot by rifles? What is this film standing next to Spirits of the beehive (1973) in the Criterion catalogue?

And while Equinox (1971) has a very heavy fan base, was it really worth a double-disc treatment, with multiple versions, commentary tracks galore and all manner of ephemera for what is essentially a glorified home movie?

Criterion's MONSTERS AND MADMEN boxed set continues this series of rather interesting release choices. The set consists of two Grade-B, borderline-C science fiction films First Man Into Space (1959) and The Atomic Submarine (1959) and two worthy, if lower-case Boris Karloff vehicles, Corridors of Blood (1958/1962) and The Haunted Strangler (1958). All four have been previously available on other labels. While it can be argued that these films have some trace historical value, they seem unlikely candidates for the much vaunted ""Criterion treatment.""

First Man Into Space in particular is an example of science fiction at its most mundane. Hot-to-trot Air Force Pilot Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards) is dead set on becoming the titular character. Waving away the warnings of his older, more sensible brother (Marshall Thompson), he barrels his experimental craft too far into the stratosphere. His jet buckles under pressure, and pesky meteor dust gets into his cockpit. Crash landing near a farm, Dan is transformed into an encrusted, cyclopean monster, pillaging the lonely countryside for unwilling animal and human blood donors to slake his vampiric thirst. His Italian ""scientist-in-a-skirt"" girlfriend Marla Landi expresses concern and the scientific and military communities express polite disinterest ...

Set in the United States but filmed in England, a forlorn stretch of misty moors at one point stands in quite unconvincingly for the New Mexican desert. In an audio commentary, producer Richard Gordon tells film historian Tom Weaver (present on all four discs in this set) says the above mentioned scene brought quite a few chuckles during the film's American premiere. Viewers familiar with this title from TV afternoon broadcasts will be surprised by many dollops of blood and gore that were heretofore previously edited out. In spite of a few distaff scares, First Man Into Space is a dreary affair. It was unofficially remade as The Incredible Melting Man in 1977.

Even less remarkable is Atomic Submarine, a maritime drama set on claustrophobic sets that is jazzed up with the last-minute addition of a flying saucer and a one-eyed monster.  After numerous United States submarines are sank without explanation along the North Pole, a special exploratory vessel is called into action. The submarine is commandeered by the militaristic Arthur Franz, who philosophically spars with a pacifist sailor (Brett Halsey), whose scientist father has since left the armed services to further the cause of world peace.  Franz and Halsey talk up a storm about the nature of honor, war, peace, science and the military before the monster puts in an eleventh-hour appearance. Ill-fated blonde bombshell Joi Lansing appears briefly as Franz's love interest.

Along with Gordon and Weaver commentary track, a filmed interview with Brett Halsey is included on this disc's extras. Halsey recalls the excitement he had working on the picture, surrounded by many serial western stars and notable character actors, but recalls that costar Franz desperately wanted to be acting in more important projects at the time of Submarine's filming.

The two historical horrors included in the set fare much better. In The Haunted Strangler (aka The Grip of the Strangler), Karloff shines as an obsessed Victorian novelist fascinated by the ""Haymarket Strangler,"" a fiend who strangled and slashed five chorus girls at the Judas Hole cabaret. Convinced that the wrong man was sent to the gallows, Insisting that an obscure medico by the name of Dr. Tenant was actually responsible, Karloff bribes a turnkey to disinter the grave of the hanged man to retrieve the murder weapon. Gripping the scalpel amidst the bones, Karloff is transformed into the grimacing, one-armed strangler, and the killings begin anew. The real underlying reason behind Karloff's interest in the murder case is revealed in a nifty plot twist, and the film turns into a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde variant.

Shot in Karloff's native England, Strangler is very carefully produced in spite of its relatively low budget. Made around the same time Hammer Studios was galvanizing the genre with more explicit gore and sex, Strangler has some remarkable bawdy content. Obviously based on the exploits of Jack the Ripper, Strangler substitutes dancing girls in lie of prostitutes for the madman's victims, That still doesn't prevent one lass from obviously proffering her services to a top-hatted gentleman in the film's opening execution scene, and few will wonder how the film's dancing girls are able to pry expensive jewelry from their wealthy gentlemen fans. Particularly memorable is a scene dissolving from Karloff's grimacing face to a line of girls dancing the can-can, bloomers and legs akimbo. In a further nod towards modernity, while the ostensible ""monster"" is vanquished at Strangler's conclusion, due to the machinations of a seemingly minor character, evil is clearly triumphant.

Extras on the Strangler disc, is a documentary entitled ""King of the Monster,"" where Karloff's costars recall what a charming old duffer he was. To this reviewer, the most priceless extras are the radio ads. Paired with Fiend Without A Face, Karloff can scarcely hide his contempt for the co-feature by declaring ""It's about weird little creatures .. Made by atomic energy ... Loathsome things that kill you by eating your brains!"" Indeed.

Ending the collection on a high note is Corridors of Blood, filmed in 1958 but released in 1962. In addition to Karloff shining in a later role, we have a very young Christopher Lee as ""Resurrection Joe,"" a Burke and Hare figure who figures into the film's heated narrative. Karloff stars as Dr. Bolton, a kindly surgeon in 1840's London who insists that there are infinitely more humane ways to treat patients than tying them down and severing their limbs with unclean kitchen knives. He begins a series of experiments to perfect a crude form of anesthesia, using himself as a guinea pig. In the process, he eventually winds up an addict, dependent on increasing amounts of opium and laudanum. He's eventually suspended from his practice, and becomes increasingly reliant on the highly criminal activities of the Seven Dials Tavern, who provide freshly murdered bodies to the medical establishment for research ....

Director Darren Aronofsky declared his Requiem for a Dream (2000) a horror film, where ""addiction was the monster."" Only nominally a horror film, Corridors of Blood presents us with a scenario where addiction -- and the corrupt society of 19th Century England as a whole -- is the monster. Karloff,  who had played countless evil doctors, outcasts of society intent on raising the dead must have been aware of the irony inherent in his role in Corridors of Blood -- a ""good doctor,"" highly regarded by the establishment who plunges filthy knives into squirming, screaming patients. One wonders if thoughts of his frequent costar, Bela Lugosi, who battled his own substance abuse issues were that far from Karloff's thoughts.

All four discs in the set boast superior transfers and more extras than any viewer would want or even need. In summation, while one questions some of Criterion's eccentric choices for preservation, no one can fault their flawless presentation.",1174176000,10,8778,5.227434257285004

Corridors of Blood also stars Karloff, this time as a doctor who slowly loses his mind over his obsession with trying to help bring about anesthesia to the surgical process. Christopher Lee also gives a fine performance in this film and it's fun to see Karloff work with Lee.

Third is The Atomic Submarine, which has a great monster eye creature at the end, but doesn't offer a lot of substance in terms of acting. It's a kind of cheesy movie, B sci fi and not all that great.

8153712,4,B000K0YM18,"Actually I got this for The Haunted Strangler and The First Man Into Space which I saw as a teenager back in the 1950s at our local movie theater.
  I loved them then and like them now. The Atomic Submarine has a good cast that is wasted on this awful movie with terrible special affects.
  Talk about cheesy. This one is loaded with cheese and not funny either. But Corridors of Blood is decent story of, if true, doctor who discovered
 ether. Karloff always gives a good performance.",1430179200,3,485,4.465909090909091
8153713,4,B000K0YM18,"Great genre examples nicely restored & packaged here for your viewing pleasure. Usually, Criterion is a name spoken and known among art house collectors, fans of classic or lesser-known foreign films and the like. For the rest of us, thankfully, Criterion also has a decent-sized collection of genre titles that were fortunate enough to receive their top shelf treatment. Many art house snobs will likely balk at the inclusion of titles like EQUINOX, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, GODZILLA (1954), THE BLOB and others in their beloved Criterion catalog...but more's the pity for them, for not being able to let their figurative hair down and just relax. More importantly, seeing these fun old films is a time-traveling trip down nostalgia-filled memory lane. You have to still be in touch with your inner eight year old or you're almost certainly guaranteed NOT to enjoy these old matinee popcorn adventures.

All four features look & sound great. ATOMIC SUB and FIRST MAN both look far, far better than I've seen offered on DVD elsewhere.  The two Karloff films were each a first-time view for me and I enjoyed them both tremendously but the 2 sci-fi adventures are what I pop in my player time & again. Yes they're silly, low budget and cliched to the Nth degree, but that's what makes them so much fun! Grab the kids (and/or friends who enjoy nostalgic sci-fi), pop some popcorn and plop down on the couch and let the films work their charms. Don't resist! Give in to the fun! As with most Criterion product, the only downside is the cost. Criterion is pricey, but remember: you get what you pay for! With that being said, if you like this kind of stuff it's worth saving up for. You're almost guaranteed to never see these movies looking & sounding better than they do here, unless someone remasters them using original film elements and transfers them onto hi-def Blu-ray.  If that ever happens I'll be double-dipping for FIRST MAN INTO SPACE and THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE in a heartbeat. 4 STARS!",1425772800,3,1989,4.793002915451895
8153714,5,B000K0YM18,"I purchased this set to get a good copy of ""Atomic Submarine"".  I was not disappointed, picture and sound are very good.

""First Man into Space"" is OK too.  The 2 other movies are horror. Not my cup of tea.",1419897600,,206,4.1
8153715,5,B000K0YM18,"I can't believe I saw the 2 Sci-fi films as first runs, in movie theaters. One a local theater, and the other, a drive in. the first man in space scared my pants off when I first saw it. I certainly wasn't used to seeing a monster defined by other peoples reaction. Neat.  A good collection of 4 films by the same director. a joy to watch.",1406332800,,339,4.059701492537314

ANYONE who goes to see ""Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory"" deserves exactly what he gets. To give you an idea, this gory mess of pottage from Britain has a jumping rock 'n' roll theme song titled ""The Ghoul in School."" Oxford, watch out! Rather surprisingly, the first quarter of the second item on this ""horror"" DVD bill, is pretty good. The title of this one is ""Corridors of Blood."" For a while it suggests those gaslit melodramas of Old London in the early nineteen-forties, starring Boris Karloff, as happens here. Horror they had, also a serious, underlying purposefulness.

""Corridors"" starts with Mr. Karloff, as an altruistic surgeon determined to prove, through experiments, the existence of anesthesia.

Opposing him are some selfish, bigoted colleagues. Some dregs of Old London are also blackmailing the poor guy, whose only aim is to benefit mankind. This portion is forthright, picaresque and carries ugly conviction, and Mr. Karloff is a persuasive, if lamblike, protagonist.

Then the film turns into a plodding, shuddersome exercise in blood and pain. It's the old one-two, strictly for the sake of shock. That's the bargain in store for any customer lured by the pair of titles.",1392163200,,1235,5.068965517241379
