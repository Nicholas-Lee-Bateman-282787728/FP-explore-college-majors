8307263,5,B001GVJYN6,"The DVD was fine quality and the program had fascinating details about an interesting topic.  It addressed questions about why the Stalingrad battle went the way it did, in particular the construction of buildings in that city and how they were affected by the sort of destruction that was done to them.",1414713600,,303,4.826923076923077
