2388827,5,B000AGTPWS,"The audio was not as poor as that. I enjoyed it and the other 3 volumes as well. It brought back fond memories. Maybe others should judge for themselves. I will go back and review Volume 2 and if I am in error, I will make the correction to it. It brought back wonderful memories.
UPDATE: The sound quality here is good, had to turn down the volume as it was loud. Will be getting the holiday specials as well. Volume 2 deserves the 5 star rating.",1172620800,,447,4.149425287356322

2388829,5,B000AGTPWS,"This item is set to release 10/18/2005.  But also scheduled to release in October/November, 2005 are Volumes 3,4 and the Holiday Spectacular.  What isn't clear so far, is that the Holiday Spectacular IS Volumes 2, 3, and 4 in one package, according to the distributor's website: Starlight Home Entertainment.  So save your money and just buy the Holiday Spectacular 3-disk set.  You get 18 15-minute episodes, plus three 30-minute Holiday-themed episodes (Halloween, Christmas, New Years) for a total of 6 hours of viewing.",1125532800,18,523,5.265060240963855

8078458,5,B000AGTPWS,"Davey and Goliath arrived in perfect condition.  I'm so glad they are on DVD now as I watched them on TV as a child.  The children are exposed to so much immorality today, we must keep shows like this at home in our livingroom.",1420070400,2,227,4.136363636363637

8078462,5,B000AGTPWS,"This is safe viewing for even the youngest toddlers and preschoolers, and is an exceptionally well-written children's collection, packed with timeless moral themes. There are many wonderful ""takeaways"" to be gleaned from the adventures of Davey and his big, goofy dog, Goliath -- humor, love, learning, music, friendship, simple examples of God's hand in our everyday life, honor, philanthropy, integrity, stewardship, servitude, and even some real-life lessons in the School of Hard Knocks.

I am no expert, but I believe this is what was commonly referred to as Claymation. Despite having originated in the 1960s, these renderings are of decent quality and have been very well received by my children. We have the set of four DVDs and enjoy watching them over and over again. In total among the four DVDs, there are (22) 15-minute episodes, and (4) 30-minute specials.

Highly recommended; watch them together and be blessed!",1295308800,,927,5.256756756756757
8078463,5,B000AGTPWS,"Davey and Goliath are a favorite from my childhood. Thaey were produced b the Lutheran church but there is not ""religion"" taught in these wonderful stories. Just good family moral values that our children need more than ever. Things like loving your neighbor, telling the truth, giving to others being better than getting all for youself. And admit it who doesn't love the fact that Goliath the dog talks. These are classics and all children should see them starting at a young age.",1216339200,,482,4.819277108433735
