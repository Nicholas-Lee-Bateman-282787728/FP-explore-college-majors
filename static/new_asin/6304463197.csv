7872388,4,6304463197,"Note: The video I watched (with the same title and cover art) was released in 1996.  It is unclear why the Amazon description says it was made in 1974 and released in 2006.

This is an excellent video and well worth watching.  The coverage is about evenly split between Great Whites in California and Tiger Sharks in Hawaii.  The main intent is to assess the scientific potential for these sharks to be man eaters.  Both sections start with an overview of local human behaviors that may put people at risk and then switches to following marine biologists working with sharks.  Scenes of note include shots of Great Whites feeding on seals and Tiger Sharks attacking albatross chicks (both of these are commonly seen in other documentaries, but are still interesting and this may have been the first video to show chick attacks).  There are also some short, but informative interviews with shark attack survivors including Rodney Orr, a California abalone diver who has been attacked by Great Whites twice.  All of the footage is excellent and all images are of the highest visual quality.

The video was initially released in 1996 and some of the information is dated.  Also, shark aficionados will already be familiar with the facts presented.  But I still highly recommend the film.  It can provide an ideal overview for people who are not familiar with sharks (for example it would be great to show in an introductory marine biology class).  It can also provide a very fulfilling summary for those already well versed with shark ecology.",1217548800,3,1540,4.876923076923077
7872389,5,6304463197,"This film deserves better ratings on Amazon. Unfortunately, it has been confused with a very bad movie of the same name, and those below who gave bad reviews are referring to the movie, not this Nova-produced documentary. In this documentary there are great underwater shots of great white sharks, filmed by brave (and maybe a little crazy!) marine biologists off the coast of San Francisco. The film does a good job of explaining what is known about great white behavior, dispelling many of the myths foisted on us by movies such as ""Jaws"". If you want a real look at one of this world's amazing creatures, check this film out.",1026259200,4,628,4.718181818181818
