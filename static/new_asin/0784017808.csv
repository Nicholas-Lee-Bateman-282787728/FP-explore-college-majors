72748,5,0784017808,"I used to find Denise annoying but over the years I have learned to appreciate her brand of ""enthusiasm""! This is one of my favorite exercise tapes. Denise was doing ""interval training"" before it had a name! I like the pace of this tape & the mix of high & low impact. Her moves are always easy to learn, nothing fancy but they are all effective. I also like that she includes an ab workout at the end. The scenery is nice too.",1341532800,,427,4.156626506024097
72749,4,0784017808,"I had been using this about 7 years ago to help me lose weight. I ended up losing 15 pounds in around 2 months, (without dieting AT ALL mind you). I did either this or Tae Bo about 6 times a week. Denise works the body cardio-wise, to burn calories, and strength-wise, to tone and tighten the body. It's sort of long and could get boring but I always had my own music playing in the background to help it go by faster. I've just recently begun using this tape again to switch up my workouts. I recommend it!",1338163200,,507,4.1313131313131315
72750,5,0784017808,"I have been doing this workout since 2001 and I still love it!  Not only do you get a cardio workout with this video but you also get a toning workout and at the end it has and extra 10 minute segment that focuses on the just the abs.  This is my go to video when I have started to pack on a few pounds.  I wish they would make this into a DVD format but I can alway have my VHS tape made into a DVD, I just can't part with it long enough to get it done.",1321488000,,454,3.5656565656565657
72751,3,0784017808,"I loved the original version of this, which is why I purchased another copy when my VHS tape wore out.  To my surprise and disappointment, the music has been changed during the aerobic portion.  The original songs were replaced with redundant and mellow background music that was poorly dubbed in.  It's also quite odd to hear Denise say ""this is my favorite song"" or ""I love this song"" when it's a boring and even annoying, repetitious sound that now plays.  The music is not at all inspirational or energizing; it almost makes me want to take a nap.

The exercise routine is fabulous!  I just can't recommend that you purchase this changed version.  I really wish there was a DVD version of the original!",1312848000,4,706,4.645161290322581
72752,5,0784017808,"After my second child I really put on weight, at 5' I was almost at 140 lbs.  I got tired of the way I looked.  I had purchased the Sizzler and started working out with Denise Austin faithfully 4-5 times a week.  I also cut down dramatically on fried foods.  I went down to 113lbs.  It took me 6 weeks but I loved the change in my self.  This was about 10 yrs ago and yes I have put on some weight since.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hit-the-Spot-Gold-Sizzler-VHS/dp/1577132882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hit the Spot Gold: Sizzler [VHS</a>]  I still have the same video and I always go back to it.

72753,5,0784017808,"I've never been a big Denise Austin fan, but I love this workout. I originally purchased it on Amazon for something different - I've been working out at home for years and my library was getting boring. A few new and some old workouts were in order.  I bought this tape because it was aerobic and cheap!  But it's now one of my favorites. The workout is easy to follow, fun and gets you sweating.  The setting is on a Mexican beach.  Denise does a few minutes of aerobics then breaks for some toning.  This format is repeated 4 or 5 times.  I always found her a little annoying but I guess not in this workout, since my original one broke a couple months ago and I quickly searched Amazon,found this one and purchased it immediately.",1295827200,,733,4.352941176470588
72754,5,0784017808,"I have been using this tape, Hit the Spot Sizzler for more than 10 years and it put me in great shape and good health. That tape got worned out and I have to get a new one (Thanks to Denise). I really enjoy the music put in this new one. It made me do my work out like crazy (the music gaves me more energy)even my 3 year old daughter (Mimi)loved them. GREAT JOB!",1290988800,,363,3.8533333333333335
72755,4,0784017808,"I just completed this workout for the first time.  Overall, I liked it though I have a few minor quibbles with it.

Denise Austin leads this 45 minute workout, the setting is the same as Totally Firm which is a nice beach in Mexico with the ocean behind it, and she is joined by the same workout partners Kellie and Jeff.

You start with a 5 minute warmup and stretch, then you spend about 30 minutes alternating aerobics intervals with toning segments.  The aerobics are pretty basic, there is some high impact but it's fairly easy to modify to low impact.  For example there is running in place, I walk in place.  There are also a few plyo squat jumps, I do regular squats in place of them.  For the ponies that are in the same segment, just take the hop out of it.  There is really only one aerobic segment that I would consider higher impact, the rest are lower and more of your standard aerobic moves, step touches, grapevines, hamstring curls, etc.

The toning segments are decent, they include overhead presses with toe taps, static lunges with bicep curls, front deltoid raises with toe taps, one arm tricep kickbacks, one arm rows for the back, plus some traditional squats and standing leg work.  I used weights for the squats, plus the standing leg work is short enough that one could add ankle weights if they choose.  There is one other toning segment that I didn't particularly care for, a squat with chest press to the front.  I don't know if I would call it ineffective, I certainly felt it after a bit but I simply prefer chest flies or bench presses for chest, even pushups would have been better.  I may just substitute one of those next time.

Most of the muscles are hit throughout this workout at least once.  I used lighter weights since some of the moves are done in compound fashion, others there were a good number of reps.  Near the end of the workout is an ab segment which includes crunches, oblique work, etc.  Cooldown and stretch follows.

Now for the quibbles, for the toning work some of the reps are uneven, not a huge deal but you don't want to be lopsided either. I also find this in Totally Firm, which is a very good weight workout. For the aerobic segments the cueing isn't the best, but if you do this workout a few times, you will be able to follow along just fine. During each aerobic segment the moves are repeated several times, I would say each aerobic interval is about 3 minutes, where the toning work is 2 minutes.

I still give this workout 4 stars, it isn't overly taxing but I worked up quite a sweat.  I also found the workout went by really fast, it was enjoyable for sure.  I don't have that many interval workouts so I imagine I will reach for this quite a bit, it's also good for days that you want just light weight work.

I like Denise Austin, I have a small handful of her workouts and feel her Hit the Spot series are among the best she has released.  I would recommend this along with her Totally Firm workout, plus her Hit the Spot workouts for Abs, Arms, Buns and Thighs are good too.",1275091200,2,3048,4.393939393939394
72756,4,0784017808,Item was brand new and in the wrapper.  I was so impressed on how fast I received the item.  I would order from Amazon.com again.,1272153600,,129,4.12
72757,5,0784017808,"I've never liked aerobics.  I tend to get way out of breath.  I was never diagnosed with asthma, but maybe I just have low lung capacity or something.  Up until my late 20's, I avoided aerobics.  But then my metabolism slowed down, so I bought this tape.  I couldn't keep up.  So I let it sit for a few years.  Well, mid-30s happened and I had to put it back into use.  With some patience and persistence, I was able to keep the pace and kinda stick with it.  Although I have places I can walk and access to a fitness center with no dues, I find getting there to be a hassle and walking in my area isn't as relaxing as it used to be.  With this tape, there are no excuses.  If I don't have time to exercise until 3am, I can do this.  If my hair and skin are a wreck and I'm unpresentable, no problem, because I can do this in private at home, naked if I want.  Too cold?  No need to go outside and the workout will get me warm in no time.  And I don't get winded because Denise gives breathing tips throughout.  I tend to get bored easily, but the interval training setup keeps things a bit interesting.  My metabolism is really low at this point in my life, and this is one of the few things that helps me maintain a proper weight or lose a few pounds if need be.  And I like having Kelly and Jeff as workout partners too.",1257811200,2,1323,4.003831417624521
72778,5,0784017808,"I purchased this vhs a few years ago, while trying to bounce back into my old jeans after a pregnancy. This is not the only workout program I own - I also bought Callanetics(toning) and the Jane Fonda series (Original Workout and The Challenge), Tae-bo and so on..... I own three Denise Austin programs (Hit the Spot, Blast away 10 pounds- which, by the way I do not recommend them for the intermediate level, they're just not challenging enough).... but for some reason I keep going back to this one - The Sizzler...... first of all it makes me sweat. I mean dripping sweat . Second, I can feel the difference in my thighs , shoulders, arms  and chest. I stopped using it and started using the <Challenge > workout by Jane Fonda which by the way makes you awfully sore the next two days but boy does this work !!!  Well, I have become kinda lazy in a while and I got back to The Sizzler who has become in the meantime not challenging enough , so I am adding 1 pound ankle weights and I must admit I am very pleased with it. It makes me feel energized the next day instead of sick / sore -when I use Jane Fondq <the challenge > , and I definitely feel toned. My problem area is the legs and it shed inches off my thighs since I have been using the ankle weights. I would definitely recommend it since it has 4 or 5 cardio sessions and 5 weight training/toning sessions. It keeps your heart rate up and makes you sweat like no other video. This workout is perfect for bodies that need some slimming at the lower level and some toning or muscle building at the upper level.",1163808000,4,1571,4.250836120401337
72779,5,0784017808,"I will say it loud and clear, I hate aerobics!! I am not a dancer and I do not like jumping around in a leotard or feeling like a failure because I can't follow the steps. This tape was different. The moves were easy to follow, I kept my heart rate up, and I had FUN!! I actually look forward to my cardio days now. I am using this tape with ""Blast Away 10 lbs"" and reaping the benefits of a killer bod!",1117152000,3,403,3.8674698795180724
72780,4,0784017808,"I originally got this video several years ago - it took me a while to warm up to Denise's style, but the workout itself - one of the best all-around workouts I've ever found on video.

Well, my old video finally wore out and I had to buy a replacement of my stand-by dependable workout - and to my horror, the original soundtrack had been replaced by a ghastly synthesizer version.

NOTE: I did not buy this from Amazon but an equally reputable source.

Now, I don't know what the deal is - did I get a counterfeit? There's absolutely NOTHING on the packaging that's different or indicates in any way that the video is a different version.  (The visuals and voice audio are the same).

The soundtrack for the abs part of the video IS the same as the original, go figure.

It's a great workout, but if not you're psyched by ""She works hard for the money"" to begin with, imagine it done as a bad synth version.  I really struggled to finish the workout, I was so disappointed.  I'm demanding my money back, but I would really love to get a copy of the original version.

I don't know what you will get if you buy this from Amazon.  But BUYER BEWARE - there are 2 (or more?) versions out there...",1109721600,2,1193,4.285714285714286
72781,2,0784017808,I purchased this video after reading reviews from other buyers.  I was not as impressed as they were.  Denise and the two backup workout people often become out of sync during the video - so you really need to pick one person and stick with them rather than watching anyone else or it throws you off.  The cues are not timed very well so I had to watch the video more than once in order to keep up.  The music did nothing for me.  I agree that I ended up with a good workout.  I was sweating at the end and I am sure I burned calories - but it is not going to be my favorite workout.  I prefer the circuit workout Cathy Smith has out - much better coordinated and you get the same workout (in a little less time).,1099094400,2,713,3.9788732394366195
72782,3,0784017808,"The only reason I'm giving this three stars is that this video is not for those who might have trouble with their joints.  I have knee problems and found this workout really aggravated my knees and my back.  I didn't feel really good as I usually do after a workout.  I will say that the Ab portion of the video is excellent and that the entire video would be good for someone who does not have a problem jumping around.  I don't find Denise Austin annoying - she looks wonderful and I'm sure she's doing her best to be encouraging.  I purchased this video, Hit the Spot Abs, and Hit the Spot Thighs as a package deal and I must say the Hit the Spot Abs is also very good.  I haven't tried the Hit the Spot Thighs yet.",1084924800,3,718,4.129496402877698
72783,4,0784017808,I have always loved Denise Austin's videos.  As opposed to watching her daily on TV I find her videos very helpful and would always purchase them.  All of her videos are easy to follow and will give you a great workout.,1078099200,,219,4.317073170731708
72784,4,0784017808,This is an excellent workout if you're just starting out and want something that combines cardio and strength training. With that said I had to give the video 4 stars because I don't feel that the cardio segmeents were intense enough. The moves are very similar to Denise Austin's Fat Burning Blast but there is no jumping or really high impact moves. This however would be okay if you are just getting back into an exercise routine or have bad knees. I would definitely recommend this video.,1063324800,5,492,4.666666666666667
72785,5,0784017808,"Two years ago I purchased this video in a set of three Denise Austin tapes.  It was my first time trying an exercise program and I was a definite beginner!  From the beginner's view point, the tape is a challenge.  After using it for a while, I improved my cardiovascular fitness a great deal, and moved on to other workouts.  I used this tape today, after not using it for a couple months, and I still enjoy it!  Denise Austin is one of my favorite fitness instructors, and, unlike many other reviewers, I really don't mind her chattering.  The Hit The Spot: Sizzler workout, in my opinion, is a very good workout because of what I viewed today.  I am at an intermediate to advanced level of fitness, versus my beginning level two years ago, and working out with this tape today was still a challenge, while showing me I had accomplished a lot.  The workout is about 48 minutes long.  It includes a five minute warm-up, twenty-five minutes of aerobic/toning circuit training, followed by less than five minutes of leg and upper back toning, ten minutes of Sizzler: Abs (A great burn, by the way!), and about a five minute stretch/cool down.
  Whenever I finish this video, I get a great feeling like I've energized and cleansed my body.  It is such a great fitness mix with aerobics and toning.  You need dumbbells, FYI.  Also, though this is an older video, the setting is at the beach and the general picture isn't outdated.  After doing the workout a few times, it is perfectly workable to turn down the volume and add your own music for extra motivation (I've done it a few times).
  All in all, this is a great workout which is motivational, fun during, and revitalizing after.  Highly recommended!",1051315200,13,1704,4.586092715231788
72786,5,0784017808,"She says results in three weeks and she is not kidding, three times a week and wow!! This video is so much fun and such a challange!! The interval training is great fun and the ab segment at the end is wonderful but tuff. This is a perfect video if you need to fit a complete workout in to minimum time and she is so motivating. A definate thumbs up for Sizzler!!",1049241600,5,363,4.055555555555555
72787,3,0784017808,"I am a Denise Austin fan, yet I was disappointed in this workout because it has been the hardest one to follow out of all that I've done.  Her cueing on this routine is the worst she's ever done!  Usually I can depend on Denise Austin videos to give enough lead time to get the moves and she explains very clearly what she's doing.  That is not the case on this video.  The moves are good, but please, Denise, give me some advance notice so I can get the full effect of the video!!",1046131200,,481,4.085106382978723
72798,4,0784017808,"I am usually not a fan of Denise Austin.  Her cueing leaves a lot to be desired and she makes a lot of mistakes in her routines.
BUT, with all that said, I do think that this is a solid workout.  Beginners can make all of the moves low impact while more advanced exercisers can make the moves more difficult.  The routine is easy to learn and there is not any confusing choreography.  It may take a couple of times to get everything down though since she does not tell you what you are going to do in advance very often (or sometimes she tells you the wrong thing).
The best part of this video has to be the upper body toning segments.  You need to purchase weights before using this video to get the full impact (start with 3 pounds and move up to 5).  Even though I don't do this video regularly anymore, I still do the arm exercises every day right before I do the cool-down of whichever tape I am doing that day.
If you are a Denise Austin fan, you should buy this video.  It is definitely one of her best.  Even if you aren't a Denise Austion fan, I would recommend this tape for all beginners.  Even though she can annoy you, she does keep you positive and makes you want to exercise more.",1028851200,4,1195,4.160869565217391
72799,5,0784017808,"If you really want to work your whole body, you need to get this tape.  You'll burn calories and tone your body with this interval training workout.  She combines aerobic exercise with weight training.  At the end she has this really, really great workout for the abs, prepare to be soar the following day.",1027209600,3,306,4.62962962962963
72800,5,0784017808,"I really love this tape. I have a lot of different workout tapes and find this one to be the best. I like how she does toning. People think that just doing aerobics is enough to lose weight, but losing weight is not enough, you have to tone in order to see any difference. I used to walk 3 miles a day, but because I did not do any toning exercises I could not see much of a difference. My husband told me that he can see MORE of a difference in me now that I doing these exercise's than when I was walking. He can see that I lost weight and said that I look great. I like the idea of the 3min aerobic work out then the 1.5 min toning. This helps because when you are doing her aerobic part you get a good workout and feel like you need that toning break in between. She is not that hard to keep up with, because she does the same thing for almost the whole 3mins except with 1 different step she puts in with it. I lost weight and also saw a differents in my figure. I used to wear a size 9-10 now I wear a 7-8 and some 6's. My goal is to lose about 10 to 15 more pounds and to get my stomach back into shape. I know I can do this with using this tape. If you are looking for a good workout tape I would suggest this one.",1025049600,2,1222,3.77734375
72801,4,0784017808,"I bought this tape (figuring I would end up adding it to the extremely large dusty collection of workout videos that I have totally wasted my money on) in search of finding one that TRULY PRODUCED QUICK RESULTS!  I had tried every diet pill, workout, starvation diets, etc. it seems known to man to get off the last twenty lbs. after having a baby.  I lost about 10 lbs. on most, but it WAS ONLY TEMPORARY!  This truly is a fun (gotta love the music too) and body sculpting workout!  With eating sensible but not totally denying myself cheats here and there it was so easy! You don't have to be a dancer to keep up, almost everyone can do this one no problem.  I not only got down to the size I was in high school, I was as toned (I am 30 years old)as I was in high school!  The only reason this one doesn't get a 5 star rating from me is that I would like to see more lower abs on this one, but that is probably why she added her additional Hit the spot abs!  I just had another baby and bought a copy today on amazon dying to get started on the ENCOURAGING journey again.  Gotta get it!  She usually gets on my nerves with her ""Bubbly"" personality, but I have found a new appreciation for the woman.  It gave me back my freedom to wear what I wanted and everyone around me was so astonished at the transformation with the muscle tone everywhere!",1015632000,5,1347,4.1461538461538465
72802,4,0784017808,"I've only been following Denise for about 2 months now.  I usually do her morning programs on Lifetime TV and found the workout was getting too easy which prompted me to buy this tape.  I agree with most other reviewers on this tape as well as others where Denise does not always work both sides evenly, she's hard to follow at times, mostly due to not letting you know in enough time she's moving onto the next move.  Also, some of her moves are tricky and the camera moves off her feet and onto a head shot too often!!!  I found myself falling behind trying to get the footwork right.  Having said all that, I do find her extremely motivating versus annoying.  I still sweat every time I do this and I find it's a complete workout leaving me energized all day.  The more you do the tape you'll have the moves memorized so now I just listen to the music and not watch her as often so I can stay on track.  I rated this 4 stars because it actually works.  I've lost 4 pounds in two weeks and see definition taking shape all over my body.  That little middle age pouch that was starting to form is actually going down!!",1014422400,,1118,4.231132075471698

Next, you move onto about 40 minutes of aerobics combined with intervals of muscle toning for your ""problem"" areas. Then, you have a cool-down which lasts approximately 4 minutes.

I alternate this with a Kathy Smith video and a Donna Richardson DVD and find that it gives me plenty of variety and I feel great after each workout session.  This tape is not so easy that I'll grow out of it quickly, either, but easy enough that I, with 2 left feet, can get a real benefit from it right away.",982886400,,560,4.0636363636363635

The video gets your heart pumping, the sweat rolling and the  breathing gets heavy. The interval training (alternating 3 1/2 minutes of  aerobics with 1 1/2 minutes of body sculpting using hand  weights) makes  things more interesting and breaks things  up a bit. I don't even mind  Denise's chatter. I find myself smiling and responding to her reminders of  ""keep that tummy in"" and ""smile, you're burning fat!""  It's also rather endearing on the few occasions when she's out of step or  not with the beat. It makes her more human and on the same level as the  rest of us.

I find myself checking my posture  when she tells me too, and even pat myself on the back when she suggests  it. But she does come off a little kooky sometimes. A couple of times she  stumbles over words or isn't with the music. But that makes her more  endearing; she's not perfect, so that makes you like her more.

She says that if you stick with it, you'll see results in 6 weeks, but I saw (and felt) the results after just a few workouts.  The moves aren't too  hard to follow and the target/weight training sessions provide a nice break  between aerobic segments.  I know some people think that she talks too  much, but her motivational comments always keep me moving.  It also helps  that she's a ""real"" woman (wife, mom with 2 kids, in her 40's)  and not some teenie bopper who's never seen a fat cell in her life.  I  would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to lose weight and  tone up that body!",958953600,4,678,4.2936507936507935
72831,5,0784017808,I think this is one of her best tapes yet.  I've only been doing it for 10 weeks now and have already dropped 2 clothing sizes!  She is very motivating and makes you want to keep it up all the way to the very end.,955584000,3,213,3.7111111111111112

I have her other video Totally  Firm, but I like this one better.",950054400,4,249,3.660377358490566
72833,3,0784017808,"i bought this tape last night and tried it. it is pretty good. the workout targets everything from cardio to muscle toning to abs and thighs. i usually have to work out to a tape then switch to do abs, thighs, and buns  seperately. the only thing that is annoying is her ""whoa!"" and  ""you can do it""..she repeats it over and over! but the tape  itself is good. lots of repetitons.",949536000,,380,4.25

I have not gotten bored with the video and I do not mind Denise's motivational utters.  Now that my tape  is beginning to suffer from permanent tracking problems because of use, I  want to replace it with another Denise Austin video (kickboxing?).  Enjoy  it and liberate yourselves!",949104000,2,405,4.541666666666667
72835,5,0784017808,"Sizzler will work your body hard, without killing you, or making you want to give up.  Denise does a super job of mixing aerobics, toning, and easy to follow dance steps.  It's worth it!",946857600,4,186,4.4411764705882355
7790768,4,0784017808,"One of my favorite go-to workouts, recently re-released for digital download. This is an energizing workout. Beautiful, beachy scenery will lift your mood. The workout itself is a nice mix of light cardio and light strength training - the pace of the cardio is similar to a walking workout, interspersed with intervals of weights. Denise has two workout partners who show good energy and demonstrate the moves well.  It looks like the colors were a bit enhanced - you can see the bright gold in the picture.  Perfect for those in-between days when you want more than a light workout, but are seeking to energize vs. exhaust yourself.  Probably best for those who loved it back in the 90s and know what to expect.

Rent vs. Buy? Note that renting this video does not reduce the purchase price, so if you are pretty sure you will buy it eventually, you might want to just buy it vs. renting.",1506297600,,889,4.6075949367088604

I bought it on Thursday and by Monday it was in my home. This is a very good workout. If you get bored easily and don't want to do a lot of reps of the same exercise, this tape is for you.
