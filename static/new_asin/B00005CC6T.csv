7938073,4,B00005CC6T,"I loved Rudolf as a kid.  Unfortantly, my mother thought I should be limited to watching it only on holidays. I don't plan to place such harsh restrictions on my two year old.  She loves reindeer stories and I'm hoping getting her Rudolf will keep Bambi from being permantly embedded in the vcr.  Plus, she loves the Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer book, so I reacon she'll love the movie even more. Hopefully, when she's older she'll get the moral of the story about that being different isn't always a bad thing.  Sometimes, it's just what's needed.",998438400,2,548,4.618556701030927
