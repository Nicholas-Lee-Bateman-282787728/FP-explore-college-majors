7763971,5,B01GKKI38Y,"I love all of Jessica's workouts so of course I had to buy this, since it's brand new. Usually her workouts are most walking but these have more strength than some of her stuff in the past. I love it. It's a great addition to my workout plan! I hope she comes out with more videos in this style.",1467763200,,295,4.016949152542373
7763972,4,B01GKKI38Y,"I'm a huge fan of Jessica Smith and buy almost anything she puts out.  All three circuits are fast paced, fun, and sweaty!  The Lower Body Circuit was by far my favorite as Jessica employs a lot of super sets to completely fry your muscles.  I found it to be quite challenging due to the number of weighted side lunges, dead lifts, and rear lunges (all using 10 pounds).  By the time I hit the ground for the floor work my legs were trembling!  Single leg glute bridges combined with some abdominal exercises are performed along with a very short series of pilates inspired leg lifts (I barely felt these).  A pretty thorough lower body workout that I will definitely be returning to!

I was a little disappointed with the Upper Body Circuit, however.  Jessica hits the shoulders HARD so I loved that and while there are moves for the chest, back, triceps and biceps I thought that while effective they were lacking.  I should say that I've been doing advanced heavy weight training for the past six months (Cathe Friedrich) so that clouds my judgment a bit; overall this is a perfect and comprehensive routine for those that want an efficient and fun workout that does target all the muscles in the upper body.  Jessica focuses on the abs at the end and they were tough, especially the plank pikes.

The Total Body Circuit was just that: Jessica hits everything using compound moves to get more bang for your buck.  It's great for anyone wanting to squeeze in a quick and effective workout session.

If you're a fan of Jessica this is definitely a must-have DVD!  While Peanut is missing (no doubt napping) both Jessica and her mom Debbie are pleasant and Jessica's instruction is spot on.  Everything moves quickly to keep the heart rate up; there is no down time in order to keep the metabolism revved.  A very good intermediate level video!",1467763200,10,1844,4.627692307692308
7763973,5,B01GKKI38Y,"These may be strength workouts, but I definitely broke a sweat doing them. I can honestly say that I felt it in my muscles the next day. Jessica shows options for a more advanced move, while Debbie shows modifications to make it easier. As usual, Jessica keeps things fun and upbeat while delivering a great workout. That's one of the reasons why I love doing her workouts.",1467763200,2,373,4.582089552238806
7763974,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Jessica keeps getting better and better. There are 3 workouts in the dvd, one is upper body, one is lower body, and one is total body focused. They are all circuits, so you move from one exercise to the next quickly. The videos are fun, so the time flies, in other words, no dread factor. Also, Debbie is back showing us modifications. The quality of the videos is really good, the set is bright and colorful, the music is upbeat and motivational, and Jessica gives great instruction, as always.",1467676800,25,495,4.573033707865169
7763975,5,B01GKKI38Y,"I LOVE STRENGTH TRAINING.  As a former cardio junkie, I learned the hard way that strictly engaging in cardio training leads to stalled results.  The reason being, cardio training fails to develop metabolically active muscle, meaning you burn fewer calories at rest.  Fast forward nearly 6 years later, and the majority of my fitness regimen revolves around strength training.  I have constantly sought the PERFECT  at-home workout DVD that allowed me to work ALL the major muscle groups, without requiring a huge time commitment, or requiring fancy equipment and machines I cant afford.  I think I have finally found the one.

This DVD release is one of Jessicas strongest, metaphorically speaking, yet.  This DVD is one in a series of Jessica Smith DVDs in the Walk Strong series.  You will find limited walking in this DVD (namely in the warm up only), although as I mentioned before, you NEED THIS STRENGTH DVD as part of your well rounded fitness plan.  Supersets are incorporated throughout all routines on this DVD.  Supersets, or high repetitions, tax the muscle groups leading to muscle fatigue and burnout, and THAT IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS.  While this DVD is advertised as strength DVD, the incorporation of both upper and lower body movements simultaneously throughout kept my heart rate in the fat burning zone and left me VERY SWEATY and feeling like I got an AMAZING WORKOUT in a short amount of time.

This DVD arrives in a hard shell case, with artwork as featured.  Three, 35-minute routines are included on 1 disc for a total running time of 105 minutes.  You will need 1-2 sets of weights for this program, one lighter and one heavy, weight dependent on your fitness level.  I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser, and used 5 and 8 pound weights.  If you are working out on a hard surface, a yoga mat or towel is suggested.  Supportive footwear is also a must, as you will be lunging, squatting and there is an occasional pivoting move (modified for those unable to do these movements).  A count down timer is present during all the routines.  As advertised, Jessica Smith is your trainer for these three routines, joined by her Mother, Debbie, on modifications.  We do see Peanut in the introduction, but unfortunately during the workouts, she is busy directing the production.  '

This DVD is beautifully set in a gorgeous home in front of a pair of French doors overlooking a serene pool and beautifully landscaped yard.  The music for these workouts is upbeat, and motivating, as is Jessicas careful cueing and bubbling personality.  As always, Jessica demonstrates all levels of each move, providing modifications, and tips for maintaining safety and getting the most out of each move making this a DVD that will work for most everyone.

The three, 35-minute routines include:

Upper Focus (Circuit 1):  This routine begins with a 4 minute walking/marching warmup, followed by multiple supersets focused on the upper body.  Shoulders, chest, biceps, triceps, core and back are all worked, many of the moves incorporating both upper and lower body at the same time.  Familiar moves, like shoulder presses, bicep curls, triceps kickbacks, and crunches are featured, many with the added bonus of leg work to increase your caloric expenditure.  I was a sweaty mess, and felt like Hawkeye from the Avengers in the upper body by the time I was finished.  LOVED IT!!!

Lower Focus (Circuit 2):  My ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE ROUTINE ON THE DVD.  This routine begins with a 5 minute walking and dance-y warm-up and is followed by concentrated leg work with weights.  Featured are squats, lunges, deadlifts, plies and the final 10 minutes is set on the mat, with additional abdominal work, single leg hip bridges.  The routine concludes with Pilates-inspired concentrated work for the hips that BURNS SO GOOD!!!!  1 set of weights is used for this routine, the size is your choice.  I stuck with 8# throughout

Total Focus (Circuit 3):  This routine combines upper and lower body work, but the moves are entirely different from the first two routines.  No time is wasted, as you jump straight out of the gate, doing the first set of exercises sans weights, then you repeat the set with weights.  The sets are not as long, but with the exception of a few movements, they are repeated once.  The first 2/3 of the DVD is standing work, finished off with a core segment on the floor.  Some of the combinations and moves featured include stationary lunges (with or without pulsing) with bicep curls, single-leg triceps press,  courtesy squats with shoulder presses and Turkish Get-Ups to name a few.

Each circuit was exciting, challenging, and left me feeling like I got an amazing workout in a short amount of time.  And I sweat just as much, if not MORE than I do with my typical cardio routines.  I love having the option to pick or choose depending on my preferences, while ensuring that I get the biggest bang for my buck.  This DVD will become a regular addition to my strength training rotations.",1467417600,211,5015,4.863046044864227
7763996,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Jessica Smith has become my favorite fitness guru!  Her positive attitude and ever-present smile are so encouraging.  Jessica mixes things up in this video, and I could feel the burn long after the workout.",1527811200,,206,5.029411764705882
7763997,1,B01GKKI38Y,I have been enjoying Jessica Smith's DVD's.  I'm 62 and have some major back and joint issues and have been easily able to modify the workouts to get a satisfying exercise experience.  That was not the case with this DVD and it was also boring.  A great disappointment.,1526688000,,269,4.5625

7764002,1,B01GKKI38Y,"I bought a about 3 of these DVDs, I just don't like them at all.  They did not hold my attention, just plain boring.  I donated them to Goodwill.",1523318400,,145,3.9655172413793105

7764016,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Love that Jessica uses different moves I haven't seen before and has her Mom showing easier options so I can follow the one that fits my level on any particular exercise.  I get a really good workout, work up a sweat, without killing myself.  The 35 minute time is perfect.",1522195200,,273,4.44

7764018,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Wow! This is a true workout. I am 53 and don't like to sweat or be out of breath. I never do cardio but I have Jessica smiths walk on dvd and really like it so I figured I would try a more intense workout with her. I had to pause it twice to catch my breath and wipe my sweat. Its not difficult to do its just a lot to do for someone who hates exercise. Its 30 min but took me a bit longer. Ill have to not do as many reps and hopefully will be able to build up to the full workout. I was able to keep up with the floor portion. My legs feel like wet noodles so I know its worth the investment. After all, Summer is right around the corner.",1520121600,5,640,3.678832116788321
7764019,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Another great workout dvd  from an excellent instructor. If you want to get a great exercise session indoors, I highly recommend Jessica Smith. Modifiers for every exercise so you can control your moves based on your own physical needs. Bubbly and cheerful. Love her! I enjoy being able to workout at ho e whenever I want without having to drive somewhere. Keeps me I. Shape all winter. The miles go by fast and you can choose how many you want to do.

7764022,5,B01GKKI38Y,"I purchased this DVD with the ""Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts"" DVD and have been using them in conjunction almost daily.  One 35 minute circuit from this DVD followed by one 15 minute circuit from that DVD.  I must admit I grudgingly purchased these DVDs as I consider myself advanced having done programs like T25 and boxing but due to a recent health diagnosis I've been told I need to take it down a notch.  I honestly can't believe how much I'm enjoying Jessica's program.  They are super challenging and get my heart rate up but keep me in the safe zone where I need to be nowadays.  I love how motivating she is and that her mom accompanies her in the background doing slight modifications when needed.  I highly recommend.",1518480000,,733,4.515151515151516
7764023,5,B01GKKI38Y,My first Jessica smith DVD and I love it! Im just starting out with fitness and as a busy mom these 35 min workouts are great! Im on my early thirties and extremely out of shape. These were all just the right amount of push! I love that all the exercises were easy enough and nothing extreme!,1518393600,,292,4.140350877192983
7764024,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Like this instructor. She doesnt talk so much , just enough to I instruct and encourage. Also like that her Mom is doing them right along with her, so you have two options and can work your way up to more difficult moves. Her workouts are as hard as you want to make them.",1517184000,,272,4.055555555555555
7764025,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Fantastic workout for an at-home workout for the exerciser who wants efficient circuit training.  There are 3 35-minute workouts on the dvd.  First focuses on upper body, second focuses on lower body, and third works the entire body.  Despite focus on specific regions, each workout works the entire body by utilizing squats and light free weights.

What I LOVE about this dvd is that I used to be an Intermediate exerciser but due to a pregnancy and other life changes, I have had to restart my workouts as a Beginner.  Many of these other dvds focus on Beginner or Intermediate levels.  As someone who wants to get back to the Intermediate level, knowing that I already have an at-home option is fantastic.  Jessica Smith offers modifying options to build up to harder levels.  No matter the exercise level you can handle, a squat is a great movement.  Jessica and her mom show variations on how to work a variety of squats for the Beginner through Intermediate level.

Besides the variety, I needed an at-home option that didn't take a ridiculous amount of time.  The intro menu actually loads quickly and offers you to choose ""Workout 1 - Upper Body"", ""Workout 2 - Lower Body"", ""Workout 3 - Entire Body"", and ""Play All"".  When you select your choice, it starts up immediately.  There is at most one minute before the actual workout begins.  You will need 1 or 2 sets of free weights (Beginner or Intermediate) and a yoga mat.  There is a timer that counts down the 35 minutes.  Jessica uses all 35 minutes for the workout with the warm-up taking 3 minutes and the cool-down taking 3 minutes.  No time is wasted of the 35 minutes.  I make sure to drink some water before and after the workout as you do not have time to pause throughout the workout.  I love this aspect as I do not have dead time.  As my workout abilities improve, I do not have to worry that I am leaving behind the dvd's usefulness.

I have a gym membership and I run outdoors with my toddler in nice weather.  But between hard weather and sick kids, I need something to work on strength and balance.  I also work at a desk and craft which means lots of sitting.  The running or a hard gym workout can put my joints and muscles at risk for injury.  I have done many Beachbody workouts and can confidently say those are workouts that I risk twisting a knee or struggle with as a returning Beginner exerciser.  This dvd is perfect for building strength and balance for my other cardio workouts.  I love that I have this dvd.",1514851200,14,2494,4.496659242761693
7764026,5,B01GKKI38Y,"By far my favorite trainer online. She makes sure to include movements that will help you function in everyday life and build deep strength in you abs as well as other areas and not just focus on wearing a bikini.

7764028,5,B01GKKI38Y,Love this workout!  Seems easy but makes you sore the next day. It gets your heart rate up because you are always moving and is strength training to build muscle. Jessica is the bestmotivates you without being pushy or telling you to work harder.  Just makes you feel good all around. Definitely recommend Jessica Smith workouts above all others!,1512950400,,346,4.8474576271186445

My pant are so baggy in the butt now!! I alternate between upper & lower. I haven't even wanted to take a day off from it yet!  This dvd (35 min), followed by 30 min of cardio is my new fave workout.",1507161600,2,357,3.6363636363636362
7764032,4,B01GKKI38Y,"I have her Walking Workout, which is pretty easy.  I was hoping this would be more difficult and it is!  There are three 35 minute workouts, upper body, lower body, and full body.  I tired the upper body first and could only make it for 15 minutes.  Then I tried the full body and made it 17 minutes.  I tried the lower body and was able to go for 20 minutes.  Do I like working out?  Not at all.  So I can't say ""I love this workout"". haha!  But I do feel that it will make me stronger, so I am going to try to do it 2 or 3 times a week and work up to the full 35 minutes.  It is a hard workout for me.

7764057,5,B01GKKI38Y,"These are very hard for me. I broke my shoulder last year, required a plate and 22 pins...and I am 78 years old. But I have worked out for over half my life. It was heartbreaking to me to think that I might not be able to regain my former condition.
Well...I will never be quite so good with that left arm...but a DVD like this that is a real challenge restores my faith in my ability always to be the best I can. Right now I only work with 3 and 5 pound weights but I still do Jessica's version, not Mom's. It is hard but it will get easier.

I love that the dvd incorporates strength training but is low impact. I don't have knee problems - yet - but my knees do not like burpees, jumping jacks and all the other high impact exercises that other dvd's use.

7764074,5,B01GKKI38Y,"These are the toughest workouts I've ever done. I am currently in week 2 of Jessica's Walk Strong 2.0 program, and I've never sweated so much or worked so hard. I really feel like I'm making great changes to my body, and each day, I feel a little stronger than the day before.

 I started out about 100 pounds overweight. I've been working out daily for the past couple of months, but have seen more positive changes in my body in the past couple of weeks with these DVDs than the rest of the workouts I had been doing. I don't like going to the gym, so the fact that I can do these in the comfort of my own home is huge for me. I enjoy Jessica's positivity and daily mantras. If you plan on doing the entire program, you will need a small playground ball, a 6 foot medium resistance band, an aerobic stepper, a yoga mat, and two sets of handweights, one lighter and one heavier. I use 3 pound and 5 pound weights.

Please do not be fooled by reviews that these workouts are easy or boring. For someone who is very advanced, these may not be enough, but for beginner to intermediate, these will make you work like you never have before.",1494979200,2,1136,4.225806451612903

7764094,3,B01GKKI38Y,"Jessica is my favorite workout instructor but this DVD is just not for me.  I find the techno beat/music to be distracting and annoying, so much so that even if I loved this workout I most likely would not do it again.  The upper body workout has a variety of moves with weights but I did not feel that other than my shoulders, my arms did not get much of a workout.  I was not expecting push-ups---my least favorite exercise---and with the push-ups and planks my wrists were very sore.  The lower body workout has some Pilates-inspired moves which I liked very much but there was not enough of them to enjoy this workout either.
I purchased this DVD to use as a strength workout to compliment my cardio workouts.  I really feel that you get a much better workout with Tear and Shred in the 21 Day Weight Loss DVD and with the Build Balance + Inner Strength DVD.  I  have a couple of minor issues with Walk On Metabolism Booster but I believe you also get a much better workout (esp. lower body) with that DVD than Boost Metabolism + Strength.",1491177600,6,1043,4.373056994818653

7764098,5,B01GKKI38Y,"I've had this DVD for about 3 weeks now. I'm in the process of losing weight so I've been working out for a few months. I wanted a workout that would switch things up for me but still provide good strength and cardio training. This has been great for that! You get 3 workouts in one DVD and each is 35 minutes long. I do them first thing in the morning before I get ready for work. The workouts require some free weights so I'm using a set of 5 pound and 3 pound weights, although you could use just one set if you wanted to or are just beginning.  Jessica has a very encouraging and down-to-earth tone to her personality in the workout. I sometimes get annoyed with other exercise DVDs when the trainers are making it look so easy while you're struggling to get through each set but Jessica and her mom let you know that they are working hard right along with you.  I've actually recommended this video to my own mom because of the modifications that Jessica's mom demonstrates in the video.  I also like that there's no jumping around or lots of stepping.  I have knee and plantar fasciitis issues and none of these workouts aggravate my knees or feet.",1490227200,3,1154,4.3534883720930235

Anyone with lower back issues should be sure to follow Debbie on the lower body workout as there are lots of moves bending over. Well worth the money.,1489968000,4,455,4.3023255813953485

7764133,2,B01GKKI38Y,"I have been starting to get back into shape and have been doing a couple other DVDs. With the title being Walk Strong, I thought this was an aerobic type work out with muscle training. The only aerobic part is marching in place. The rest is just set after set after set.

Pros: Timer on the screen, you can see how much left in your workout
  There is an upper, lower, and total workout

Cons: This is not for beginners, you are practically doing squats with everything the first 10-15 mins and my legs started seizing up, which brings  me to my next con.
  No warm up, no stretch in beginning.... I wasn't use to doing pure straight squats over and over and it starting physically hurting my legs.
  Need a bit of floor space. You will be extending arms and legs fully out at the same time and such. I was hitting my couch a bit and having  to rearrange my mat.
  The upper work out doesn't do much for arms. My legs are killing me and my arms are fine. I'm afraid to see what a lower body work out for her is.
  It was a little repetitive... she kind of stuck with certain moves longer than I'd like... not so much for tired reasons, but for boardum... but not bad. Just I've seen a better variety with other DVDs.

Basically, if you are already in shape and want a hard press work out video, this is it. If you already weight work your legs and butts, this will be good. Not for beginners.",1483920000,3,1392,4.180451127819549
7764134,5,B01GKKI38Y,"This DVD has three 35 minute strength training routines.  Its Jessica and her Mom, Debbie.  All workouts are circuits, meaning you move quickly from one exercise to the next, with no rest.  This is what keeps your heart rate elevated.

There are about 17 minutes of standing exercises and 17 minutes of floor exercises.

You will need both lighter and heavier dumbbells, around 5 pounds and 10 pounds.  Debbie is just using light weights, 3 pounds.

UPPER FOCUS
Moving mantra is: Todays struggle is tomorrows strength.

I am smiling to myself as I write this review.  I like to list my favorite exercises but I loved them all in this routine.  So, I will just list a few.  Some of my favorites are: side warrior with press curl, back lunge with narrow front press/raise, rotating triceps, side squat with front raise and rotational row with deadlift.

LOWER FOCUS
Moving mantra is: Strong legs can carry you through the toughest of obstacles.

I felt this was more of a balance and leg workout, rather than strictly a leg workout.  As a result, my heart rate was not as elevated as it was during the Upper Focus workout.  This was a bit surprising since normally when I work my legs, my heart rate is up there.

The standing portion was about 25 minutes and the floor work, 10 minutes.

Some of my favorite standing exercises include: balance squat, side lunge with inner thigh lift, split stance deadlift on one leg, alternating side leg extension, calf raise/toe tap and grand plie with bicep curls.

Some of my favorite floor exercises include: figure 4 hip raise, lying rainbow leg and happy baby.

TOTAL BODY
Moving mantra: Turn adversity into an advantage.

My heart rate was elevated for the entire workout and I loved the feeling!

The standing portion was about 24 minutes and the floor portion was 11 minutes.  I especially liked that the warm-up included previews of the moves done later with weights.  Several of the moves also work your balance, something we all need.

Some of my favorite exercises from the standing portion are: plie squat with overhead press, squat with swing and balance on one leg chest fly.

Some of my favorite moves from the floor portion are: chest fly with leg extension and Pilates roll with one arm up and one leg bent.

Some of the reps felt pretty long and I started to feel some dread creep in on me.  However, the workouts themselves are very good, even with 5 pound weights. There's a good amount of compound/circuit training in these, which I do like.  I'm one who normally uses 8 and up, but had to downsize on some of the moves.

The pain is worse when driving for some reason but I have had to lay off the plyo metrics and am hoping that makes the difference. I have almost every one of Jessica's DVDs and have loved her workouts since exercise tv. Her mom is only a few years older than me so I am motivated to see her working out with Jessica. I also like that Jessica takes the approach that we are not trying to get 6 pack abs just maintain health for every day activities. At 54 I could care less about having 6 pack abs I just want to keep my weight at a reasonable place and have toned muscles. It is tough fighting post menopausal weight gain and thyroid issues.

7764266,2,B01GKKI38Y,"I absolutely love Jessica's Walk Strong Transformation System...all exercises were doable even for those with knee and shoulder issues like myself.  I should have known that her new DVDs for Phase II would have kicked it up a notch and they definitely do...so much that I can't really do this strength training dvd without feeling like I've totally sacrificed the workout with all the modifications I had to do.  First off, Upper body had way too many shoulder exercises and lacked in biceps and triceps plus I'm not happy with all the lunges and squats that are in each routine.  Even modifying with Debbie felt like I wasn't getting much of a workout in at all.  Upper Body is doable tho as I can do baby squats or none at all.  I prefer upper body workouts without squats and lunges added to it.  Those of you with knee issues and shoulder issues I cannot recommend this dvd to.  And I hate abdominal floor work that stresses out the neck so decided to do planks instead and other exercises that keep my neck on the floor.  I will keep this dvd tho as I hope to maybe strengthen up my knees and shoulders in the future and can eventually do it and I can do the upper body routine...somewhat.  I do hope Jessica isn't venturing back into tough workouts like in the 10 pounds down, etc.  I've been so happy to have found her since her workouts are so doable with no stress on the joints or knees...no balls to the walls kinda stuff.  If she kicks it up anymore, I won't be able to continue to buy her dvds and it's so hard to find ones from other instructors that actually work for me.",1471737600,20,1586,4.360544217687075
7764267,1,B01GKKI38Y,"This would be a great workout if you want the boost metabolism to be squats and lunges, especially at a high pace. There are modifications, but if you should not be doing high reps of lunges or squats I do not believe this video is for you. I do like the exercise routines with the weights. I will probably return this though.",1471737600,8,326,4.274193548387097
7764268,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Jessica Smith is my new favorite work out person! I found her videos on you tube and she is such a motivating instructor.  I've been doing her cardio videos daily and this video is the perfect way to get that very important strength training into your routine.  I can do all of the workouts without difficulty as her routines are easy to follow but they definitely make an impact as I am sore the next day, a good sore.  I am so glad that I found Jessica's videos!",1471651200,2,464,4.25
7764269,3,B01GKKI38Y,"I was looking for a weight training video, something that could help me get started and build up.  While this is a good DVD, I would prefer to have a a separate beginner's work out.  In this one, she does it and her Mom does a slightly lower impact version, and she tells you to ""do what you can.""  I just feel like I'm not able to keep up and it's frustrating as she keeps moving right along.  Her Mom is in good shape and really her work out is not that much different.  Probably a better DVD for someone already doing weight training.",1471651200,2,537,4.125
7764270,3,B01GKKI38Y,Jessica's videos are great... but this video I expected more  arm exercises with dumbells.  Just has around 15 minutes with dumbells and the rest of the video are exercises on the floor.  If you have difficulties getting on the floor this video will not work out for you.,1471478400,7,271,4.604166666666667
7764271,5,B01GKKI38Y,"Fantastic workout and I loved her transitions and her involving her Mom.  It made me feel better when I was ready to fall over at the end of the total body circuit to see all of her sweat drops on the ground!  It's a vigorous workout and some the floor work is really difficult if you have any back or neck issues (ie: the full sit-up from the ground), BUT you can do what you need to do to make it work for you.  It was a really hard workout for me and I am so sore, but that's great because it means it's working my muscles to help get them back into shape!!  Jessica is upbeat but really engaging and I really like her personality. It was also great to see her focus on your total health and strength and NOT on what you'll look like a bikini- because let's face it, many of us out there aren't here for that.  Being strong, healthy and able to move with ease is what exercise is about and if we end up looking awesome, that's the icing on the cake!  I'm on day 3 of the Walk Strong challenge and lets just say that sitting down has been *quite* a challenge!  So, if you're really out of shape, I would recommend modifying at first, unless you are good with being super sore.  Thanks, Jessica for a challenging and simple to follow workout that really packs a punch!",1471305600,24,1269,4.130081300813008
7764272,5,B01GKKI38Y,This is an excellent DVD for anyone looking for an all over muscle toning program.  At 55 I am really feeling  the need to improve muscle tone. This was the answer for me. It may not be for hardcore fitness buffs but it is definitely challenging and can be made more so by adding  heavier weights. I bought it as part of Jessicas' Summer of Strength workout program which I highly recommend. I have many of her DVDs.  I wouldn't part with any of them.,1471305600,,451,4.270588235294118

7764274,4,B01GKKI38Y,I really enjoy this workout video by Jessica Smith. The workouts don't seem like they are working but oh boy do you feel the weight training a day or two afterwards. I'm glad I purchased this.,1471219200,,192,4.361111111111111

I love how Jessica intersperses some really nice moves for functional fitness and moves that are good for preventing injuries.  She is sneaky badass!  It is just her and her mother, who is the modifier.  I am VERY glad I added this to my extensive workout DVD collection.",1470355200,2,429,4.435897435897436

7764282,5,B01GKKI38Y,Using  this as part of a 4 DVD set for the walk strong summer of strength challenge . All 3 workouts on this DVD are 35 mins long . Really liked the count down clocks on this and the other 2 The yoga does not have one and doesn't need one in my opinion. I really like the adaptability of this entire DVD set . Also family friendly .,1470009600,,332,3.8115942028985508

7764285,5,B01GKKI38Y,"If you love to sweat, you'll love these workouts. They're each about 35 minutes and there are three circuits. I love circuit training because it moves quickly through each exercise and keeps the heart rate up.

My favorite is the upper focus because it incorporates walking to help me get in my daily steps. While I love them all, the lower focus circuit does a lot of floor work, which I'm not particularly happy about and doesn't keep the heart rate up as much. However, it's all part of a well-balanced routine and I still get excited when it's circuit day, no matter which option I'm doing.",1469836800,,594,4.5514018691588785
7764286,5,B01GKKI38Y,I really love this workout dvd. It is another amazing dvd from Jessica. I actually bought all 4 of her new dvds to do the fitness program. I love that she has her Mom for her modifier. Looks like they are close which great because that is how I am with my Mom. I currently have a fractured ankle that is almost completely healed but have to wear a boot because my ligaments are strengthening out. I'm able to still do this dvd with no problems. I love that it is low impact. I would definitely recommend to anyone. Jessica is amazing and very motivating. I have all of her dvds. By far my #1 fitness trainer.,1469664000,,608,4.205128205128205
7764297,5,B01GKKI38Y,"I bought the six week transformation videos back in april and adding these videos to them gives me a great workout. I love the variety and the positive vibe I get from Jessica. I like that she is personable and has her mom do the easier adjustments so that I can get used to the workout. With summer being crazy with the kids out of school, I find this works well so the kids can watch their shows while mom works out in the basement. I definitely feel the workout and am sore from it which is great. She works all different areas of the body from circuit lower, upper and total, to walk aerobics, yoga, and more circuit training in these. There only about 30 to 35 min long and she tells you on the back what you need for extra equipment. Mostly hand weights, stretch band, ball, and step is what you need but her mom does the workout without sometimes so you can still do it until you get the added equipment. I loved that she added the step this time. Overall very happy with this purchase. I am not in the best shape and have lots of work cut out for me to lose weight and be healthier. This gives me motivation to do so.",1469491200,,1125,4.141552511415525
7764298,2,B01GKKI38Y,"I found these workouts to be poorly organized & as if she came up with them off the top of her head.  The transitions were awkward, which didn't make for a good workout. I don't like that she is talking to her mom in them because we can't hear what her mom is saying so we are not in on the conversation anyway. I just like her YouTube videos better.  They are just her & don't seem fake as these workouts do. I am a huge fan of hers so I am disappointed.  She has been coming out with so many DVD sets that it almost seems as if she is getting greedy & just churning them out left & right & letting the quality go down in the process.  I like that she got rid of that 3rd person she usually had in her DVDs tho.  I guess she was trying to make these more like her YouTube workouts (which I give her credit for) but I don't think I will be purchasing any more of her DVDs.  The outfits were cute tho. I always like how she dresses.",1469318400,,931,3.873684210526316

7764304,5,B01GKKI38Y,"I've done 2 of the three workouts.  They are challenging, yet a beginner can modify to make it easier.  I really like Jessica Smith's style.  She's very encouraging without being wimpy.  Also, she can count.  So many instructors can't count and you end up doing 16 reps on one side and 12 on the other.  Jessica is consistent.

I'd recommend the entire series.

P.S  Background.. I'm a consistent exerciser.  I've done P90x, T25, LesMills, Jillian Michaels, etc.  Jessica is my favorite, followed closely by the LesMills Combat.",1468368000,25,528,4.954022988505747
7764305,5,B01GKKI38Y,These are great strength/toning workouts!  I actually felt (a little) sore the next day (in a good way!) after doing one of these workouts and that doesn't usually happen!  I love that each workout utilizes strength and cardio in the same session - feels like a complete workout in just 35 minutes.  Another winner!!!,1468195200,2,317,4.833333333333333

That's why I knew her new dvds would be awesome.  I bought this one on Jessica's digital store along with her other newly released videos, and I LOVE this one!  I have been working out for 20 years and I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser and this video was still challenging.  Don't be dismayed if you are not an advanced exerciser, because you can lighten your weights and do modified moves with Jessica's mom.  These videos will assure that people of any exercise level will get a great workout.  There are no high impact moves in this dvd, but my heart rate was up and I was sweating for all three workouts!  I highly recommend this one.",1468108800,2,793,4.427586206896552
