8754341,5,B01CXJRVL6,"This review is about the quality of the DVD. Although this is a barebones release with noticeable interlacing and bitrate problems in spots, the transfer is certainly good enough to be enjoyed on a large screen. The source print is clean and it's clear that care was taken to preserve contrast levels. The English subtitles are too large and in spots badly timed, sometimes coming way before the line is spoken, but this shouldn't deter the kinds of folks who will be interested in seeing this.

The film is excellent and worth seeking out.",1502236800,,540,4.74468085106383
