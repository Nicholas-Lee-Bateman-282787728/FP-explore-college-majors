4905795,1,B005YFGIX4,"Buyer beware! Even though the product page and the DVD cover itself says the movie has closed captioning, it does NOT. Would not have purchased it had the labeling and identification been correct. Can't speak to the film itself as I wasn't able to watch it, but from the other reviews it sounds wonderful which makes this all the more frustrating.",1331596800,2,347,4.704918032786885
4905796,5,B005YFGIX4,"My fellow Amazon reviewer - K. Harris - has pretty much covered the plot, and back story, of this film, so I won't repeat much of what he (?) has written. This 2011 90-minute documentary, shot in black and white on what appears to be HD digital (the images are sharp) is part of the almost never ending story of Irish Singer-songwriters Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. The film of their meeting and beginning as performers was captured in the film ""Once"". This current film documents their careers beginning after their success for winning the Oscar for the Best Song (""Falling Slowly"") and follows them to their current status as performers, but no longer lovers. And, now ""Once"" has been brought to the Broadway stage as a musical (with the Original Cast album being released today!).

This film has THREE Directors and, while the concert footage - and there is a lot (including 8 musical performances among the 10 deleted scenes - an additional 45 minutes - in the bonus features) - is what you would expect, many of the ""personal"" scenes - especially one lengthy scene in a caf at the 1hr, 10 minute point - is VERY personal. It's hard to believe that the couple knows the camera is right there capturing their intimacy.

There are nearly two-dozen songs performed in the film, though many are excerpts.

This is a most unique music documentary in it's structure and - again, I need to use the word ""intimate"" portrait of what happens when a guy drops out of high school at 14 to become a street ""busker"" and, 18 years later, meets a girl of 18 who has just graduated from high school and together they become an ""overnight"" success in the music business with all that fame entails.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4905797,5,B005YFGIX4,"I just watched the movie on DVD. I don't really know how to describe it, or if I should even try to, since it would be difficult to put in words what I just saw and felt. ""The Swell Season"" is a movie about life, about death, about love, friendship, choices, destiny and basically about what life really is about. Like I said, I really can't write a regular review on it, as it is impossible for me to put into writing all the completeness it contains. It's an amazing movie and it exceeded all my expectations. And they were high. I would recommend to anybody who has a heart and soul to watch it!",1331596800,3,598,4.208695652173913
4905798,5,B005YFGIX4,"Wow, can these two people pull in a large audience! And being Oscar winners doesn't hurt, either! A very interesting look at what two people go through as a result of their success. I highly recommend ""The Swell Season"" DVD!",1330646400,,224,4.625
4905799,5,B005YFGIX4,"Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard were not prepared for what happened to them. Writing a devastatingly beautiful and emotionally honest love song ""Falling Slowly"" propelled a low budget labor of love ""Once"" to heights they hadn't imagined possible. The musical tale of two lonely people with bruised and battered hearts who meet on the streets of Dublin struck am emotional chord with movie goers and culminated with an Oscar win for ""Best Song"". It's hard to know how many fans of the movie even knew that the two were actual musicians and friends for many years, Mr. Hansard heads the critically heralded but under appreciated Irish band The Frames. He befriended the Irgl family while touring the Czech Republic and was immediately impressed with Marketa's musical abilities and did what he could to encourage her to develop her talent. The music chemistry between them is almost immediate and they develop a fruitful partnership. Glen feels at home in the Czech Republic and records a solo album entitled ""The Swell Season"" in Prague with Czech  musicians and Marketa's songwriting and musical assistance. This is the first appearance of ""Falling Slowly"" prior to the film's release. During the filming of ""Once"", the two acknowledge that they are falling in love despite an 18 year difference in their ages. The two become ""The Swell Season"" with the members of The Frames comprising the remainder of the band. Marketa is young and inexperienced and finds herself unprepared for the life of a rock musician on the road. The attention and devotion of fans unnerves her a bit. She questions whether she deserves the attention and struggles to find a way to accommodate fans and understand what is happening to her. Glen is a seasoned road warrior and accustomed to shaking hands and posing for pictures and signing autographs. He fails to understand her trepidation and the first glimpse of discontent in their world is revealed. At the same time, we learn something of Glen's home life. His mother Catherine appeared in ""Once"" and is extremely proud of her son's success and his Oscar. She sees this as his crowning achievement. His father James is introduced and provides a glimpse into Glen that we've never seen before. James is a ex boxer of championship caliber who is drinking himself to death. James sees his son's success as a sort of redemption for his own life in which he failed to realize his dreams. Glen struggles with this burden and the idea that his father chooses to pass quietly. He tells his son that he will not burden him with the troubles he keeps inside him. It seems that the more successful The Swell Season becomes, the more difficult the success is for Glen to deal with. His mother chastises him for his indifference to his fame and his reluctance to regard the Oscar as a meaningful achievement. She tells him to think what he wants but he won't take her happiness in his accomplishments away. Guilt stricken over his behavior, he confides all of this to Marketa in a pivotal moment filmed in a Czech sidewalk cafe. Expecting empathy, he is shocked when Marketa sadly concludes that he isn't willing or perhaps able to be happy and that he will always find something to do battle with. He is mired in discontent and he sits quietly as she tells him that he wanted success as much as anyone and he worked hard for it and now he is choosing to turn and walk away from it. Their romantic relationship quietly ends but their devotion to each other remains and is sustained by the beautiful music they make together. It's a remarkably courageous decision by the pair to allow the documentary to be released even as they admit that seeing it makes them understandably a bit uncomfortable. It's as open and emotionally honest as a film can possibly get. It's a tribute to the filmmakers that the two become comfortable enough around them to allow so many vulnerable and unguarded moments in their life to be committed to film. This isn't some extension of reality television. This is some defining moments in two incredibly talented people's life. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. Real life became a sadly beautiful work of art.",1326499200,82,4165,4.808926080892608

I can't imagine how it must feel to go from the streets to major stardom. These two handled the best they could in this film.

4905844,5,B005YFGIX4,The individuals in this documentary was very unaffected (meaning they were not playing to the camara or saying things they wouldn't normally say just because the camara was there) and natural throughout.  It must be really difficult to be on the road as they were during the time period captured here.  I felt for both Glen (his frustration with Marketa) and Marketa's inexperience with touring.

4905848,4,B005YFGIX4,The bonus is -  you get to see Markta Irglov completely naked.  I am not complaining about that!  The story starts out with the end result of Glen and Markta breaking up.  I got the feeling that Glen Hansard has a broken heart but Markta moved on. I wonder how many songs on Glen's solo album are based about her. The story then goes back to the beginning which is just after they won the Academy Award.  I think it is worth watching if nothing else than to see the relationship between Glen and his parents. Since this was filmed Glen's father passed away.,1358208000,,557,4.3173076923076925

One of the outstanding characteristics of Glen's music has always been emotional honesty. I mena, the man lays it all out there. But this !! Wow, not always pretty to watch , but always compelling. Always real. Imagine one of the ones that got away; now imagine letting someone film the relationship fro shortly after its first flowering to its death.

4905862,5,B005YFGIX4,"Sometimes a movie is just good, even if we don't like the direction the plot is going. But when that plot is someones reality and their life is being lived out on screen those twists and turns can be really sad and devastating to watch. The movie Once just wracked my heart with its passion so finding out that the pair had fallen in love just heightened the incredible experience of it all. And then, to see that their music went beyond the movie was icing on the cake. When I first saw this documentary on Amazon I was so excited to hear the real story of their lives, the behind the scenes reality of their everyday. The end result was really tragic to me but strangely beautiful all the same. I think the tortured spirit that Glen Hansaard carries with him is what makes his music so powerful, and the addition of Marketa's sweet as honey, melodic voice made for a truly magical pairing. And we'll always have that.",1342742400,2,919,4.411764705882353
4905863,4,B005YFGIX4,"The title references the recording and touring group that began as a collaboration between Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.  They  became Oscar winners and stars for their hit movie from 2007, ""Once.""  They met in Dublin when Irglova was still a teen, having immigrated from The Czech Republic with her mother.  In spite of their 18 year age difference they became music partners that developed into something more.  This documentary focuses on their post-Oscar (2008) fame.

Shot in an unromantic black and white like a home movie, the style while raw is very effective.  We see the more experienced Hansard (""The Frames"") find his dream of music stardom, but still looking for something more.  Irglova on the other hand was thrown into the fray as a shy, unassuming 18 year old at the time ""Once"" was shot.  She is clearly uncomfortable with the fame, the fans and the autographs that come with the accolades.  In one scene she is surprised coming off the tour bus early in the morning, only to find a couple teenagers looking for a conversation and some pictures.

Eventually we see their real life romance begin to fizzle and each partner can't see the other's point of view and even if they do, don't know what to do about it.  Most of the film is shot at concerts with plenty of back stage story telling.  It is convincing to see the song writing follow their relationship, whether that was the original intent or not.  We see some back story of Glen, with interviews of his proud mother and alcoholic father (who died during the filming of the documentary).  Hansard talks about his schooling as it were.  He dropped out at age 15 to begin his music career.  Unfortunately we don't get much of anything on Irglova at all.  That's a disappointment.  Still, overall this is a brief study on how fame changes a person.  The film suggests that although the couple is no longer romantically connected, the touring would continue.  From what I can tell as I write this, they have opted for solo careers.  Too bad for fans.",1342656000,,2024,4.674220963172805

The documentary gives us an understanding of the friendship and love that developed between Glen and Marketa as they made music and a movie together.  It also gives us a better understanding of the songs that chronicle their love and their eventual break up.  We learn a lot about Glen and his life and family and how it has shaped him and his music.  In Marketa he found his ""muse"".  Suddenly making music is so much easier--the words flow from their feelings and their experiences together.  We are allowed to see them in private and unguarded moments as they travel with the band.  The price of the DVD is worth it for the music alone--there are a number of songs included in the deleted scenes.  One of them is the heartbreaking song ""Happiness"".

While the DVD has some nice concert footage and some insights into their life, it was generally slow-paced, jumpy and rather depressing as their relationship slowly ends.  There were such large gaps in the filming sessions that the film lost some of its continuity.

""The Swell Season"" is a documentary named for the band Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov formed around the time that ""Once"" was made.
Unfortunately, while the movie The Swell Season contains some special moments providing insight into what it must have been like for them to get swept up in the whirlwind that ""Once"" brought about, it lacks a thread for the viewer to hold on to.  It doesn't seem to flow either chronologically or thematically.  For example, we're told the couple became romantically involved, and then subsequently split up, but it isn't really clear from the movie when either of those moments happened.
But I still gave it 3 stars because of the special moments, including:
-- interviews with Glen's parents
-- scene of band members singing Irish folk songs around a table after a gig
-- scenes of songwriting
-- scenes of concert tour (live music from the band)

8489252,4,B005YFGIX4,"The world fell in love with musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova when their tiny indie romance film Once became a world wide hit.  That adulation was fed further when they won the Oscar for best song  and gave endearing thank you speeches.  And the icing on the cake was when we all learned this lovable and appealing duo were now a real life couple, not just a movie one.

The Swell Season follows their 2 year American tour after winning the Oscar.  Shot in lovely black and white it captures fragments of terrific musical performances, snippets of life on the road, and pieces of the difficult and choppy real-life waters this seemingly fairy-tale couple went through.  The weight of career, fame and  perhaps most importantly  the much younger Ms. Irglova's need to start to be her own person with her own way of seeing and reacting to the world all puts their relationship to a severe test.

At the same time, the film gives us a lot of Mr. Hansards back-story in some amazing scenes where he talks with his alternately funny and creepily fame obsessed mother, and heartbreaking alcoholic ex-boxer father.

All these elements are always interesting and often arresting.  But for me the film is good but not great because each of these elements feels just a little incomplete, a little cut short a little cheated.

Their music and performances are terrific, but songs are never allowed to be finished; often we get just a verse and a chorus before cutting away.  The life-on-the-road elements are so brief they end up feeling familiar from other docs about musicians.

The character study element is very strong, but both one sided (we learn far, far less about Ms. Irglova than Mr. Hansard), and frustrating when we get highlights and striking moments instead of depth.

And the strongest part of the film  a very intimate look at the battle of a complex relationship to thrive (or even survive) as the people evolve, and the pressures on them grow suffers from having the process and role of time jumped over.

Any one of these threads could have been a terrific film. I could easily have been thrilled by a simple, wonderfully short concert film, or a portrait of what drives an artist, or the study of a rich and sad relationship being rocked to it's core.  But all three, plus an 'on the road' music doc sharing 88 minutes mean each of these worlds only get - at best - 20 minutes each  just not enough to get nearly as far into any one story element as I would have liked.

Still very worth seeing, especially if you liked 'Once' (without that you might feel a bit lost about just who these people ARE).  There are great and indelible moments.  I just wish the whole wasn't somehow a little lesser than the sum of it's parts.",1479772800,,2741,4.608247422680412
