7296108,5,B00ZYBI84U,This is a total must own for any George Strait fan. We have seen him in concert and this is truly excellent. He never stops doing his ultimate best and his band is unbelievable as well as all the other stars. It is one we will watch over and over. The price makes it even better!,1442707200,8,279,4.0
7296109,5,B00ZYBI84U,"The full 2-3/4 hour final concert from 2014 with 40 of Straits 60 #1 hits and 102,000 people!
When country superstar George Strait decided to stop touring for at least a year after being on the road for 35 years, he made the last stop on the last (at least for now) tour the AT&T Stadium in Dallas in his home state of Texas. He invited a few friends to each join him on two songs. Friends like Vince Gill, Kenny Chesney, Martina McBride, Alan Jackson, Faith Hill, Miranda Lambert, Jason Aldean, Sheryl Crow and Eric Church. The tickets sold out in 24 hours and all 104,000 seats were sold. This made this the largest concert attendance ever. In his career, Strait recorded 60 Number One hits and, though there wasn't time for all of there, 40 of them were performed at the concert, which lasted (including the requisite encores) over 2 hours and 45 minutes! All of the concert was recorded and its here on this DVD being released at the end of August. (I was provided with an advance screening copy in exchange for an objective review.).

The concert was broadcast on the CMT cable channel but  since I don't get cable  it was new to me. If you are a Strait fan and saw it, here is another chance to hear the songs again (they are nicely indexed) or, if you missed it, youll probably want this video.
I did have one small gripe  especially at the beginning of the concert  that may, or may not, affect you. Strait and his band  some of these guys have been with him more than 25 years!  were positioned on a large revolving stage in the middle of the stadium. The turntable seemed to move at a pretty good speed (how did Strait not get dizzy?) at the beginning and while you are watching Strait perform the audience is constantly moving. I actually got dizzy watching a few of the numbers. But this goes away after the first 20 minutes or so.

The camera work is great and so is the sound.

The DVD contains two bonuses. First is a section called Strait Talk which is an interview with Strait after the concert about his career and touring (where he does say that he might go back on the road after a year off). This lasts 10 minutes. Then there are very short interviews with each of the aforementioned guests where they comment on how happy they were to be there. This lasts 11 minutes.
The DVD package includes a 4-page color booklet of photos and production credits.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7296230,5,B00ZYBI84U,"I discovered George Straits The Cowboy Rides Away: Live from AT&T Stadium DVD last week while I was browsing through the music section at Amazon.com. Being an ardent fan of country music in general, and of George Strait in particular, I immediately ordered the DVD, figuring it would probably be pretty good

Pretty good now THERES an understatement!  The Cowboy Rides Away: Live from AT&T Stadium may be the best recording of a live concert Ive ever seen. For almost three hours, George Strait and panoply of some of the greatest stars in country music dazzled the gathered crowd of over 104,000 cheering George Strait fans at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas, Texas. Guest stars included Vince Gill, Faith Hill, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert, Kenny Chesney, Martina McBride, and others. Even George Strait's son Bubba gets into the act. All were on hand to help celebrate the final concert of the final tour of George Straits illustrious 33-year career.

The The Cowboy Rides Away: Live from AT&T Stadium DVD contains 2 hours and 45 minutes of non-stop music, and includes 40 of Straits greatest and most memorable songs.  Nearly every song on the DVD is a George Strait greatest hit. Video quality is outstanding, approaching high definition resolution. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound is positively phenomenal.

I own very few music videos in my DVD/BD collection. Among my favorites are Eagles Farewell Tour II and Waylon Jennings: Austin City Limits.  But George Straits The Cowboy Rides Away: Live from at AT&T Stadium tops them all. This will very likely be one of my most often played DVDs for a long time to come. Most highly recommended.",1463961600,10,1651,4.920863309352518

7296282,5,B00ZYBI84U,"This is a DVD Live  Reproduction of the entire Final Tour, The Cowboy Rides Away Concert Held at AT & T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on June 7, 2014. Thank you Amazon for having this DVD available. I would have been heartbroken as I spent many years chasing tail in local bars in New Mexico & Texas between 1977 & 1984 before a duty assignment moved me to Japan. To tell the truth, the music actually followed me over there. I spent many Friday & Saturday's listening to George Strait back than. I have every record they ever put out. I love his music as it does not get more CLASSIC COUNTRY than this. This Cowboy has class. Now for the Music. This is a DVD & runs just about 3 hours. That's right folks 3 hours. 1st  let me thank the sponsors. Coke, Pepsi, Coors, Miller, & who ever else was trying to stick there nose into it. Thanks for not showing up & ruining the show. Oh I'm sure there where a few who were left out to hang by George, buy hey that's business. Thanks to the producers who did not step in & condense the concert to a 20 minute melody of his greatest hits. I'm sure there was a room left way out in the back where these guys got locked up tight along with the sponsor agents. I can honestly say that if George Strait was going to put on a final tour concert, this was the way he wanted it. Each & every song he sang had the love & passion that George has always put into his songs, in there entirety. Nothing was cut out. Not verses, not lyrics, no short cutting nothing. George did this one for the fans. Those 104,793 fans who had the privilege to be there that day got to witness first hand what George Strait is all about. This DVD arrived in perfect condition as scheduled & will be watched & cherished for a lifetime. Thanks George Strait.

P.S. After 3 hours of flawlessly going through over 30 years of his music in 40 songs, this Cowboy never even beat a sweat, Just a big ole Cowboy Smile.  George aint over, He'll be back",1454284800,15,1953,4.172413793103448

7296286,3,B00ZYBI84U,"Great concert but the audio is strange.... ???? I'm not sure what it is. It just sounds to me like the voices have been tuned and managed to the point they just don't sound natural. Still, I had to have this concert DVD. By the way some songs are fine but it is real noticeable on others. Maybe I got a bad copy. I know live concerts aren't the easiest to record. That being said, I love the concert and have bought another copy for a gift. This is a must have for George Strait fans or music fans in general.
Update: I figured it out. There is no external sound. 105,000 people and no sound from them until the song is over? Very polite crowd? I watched several recordings from fans at the concert and the crowd sang along with every song. It seems ""sanitized"" and with that the singers voice seems changed. A friend told me that's the way they do it now. Not like my Woodstock LP. Still a GOT TO HAVE!",1453766400,4,903,4.1657142857142855

Totally charming & somehow manages to make it all look totally effortless.  Lots of guest singers:  both male & female.  Watch him w/Miranda Lambert & her black leather shorts...he definitely likes her.  You gotta feel sorry for Bubba - his son - he's got none of his poppa's talent or charisma.  Kenny Chesney wears grandpa clothes?  The call-back-on-the-stage numbers are to die for...,1453680000,7,498,4.776470588235294

7296301,5,B00ZYBI84U,"A celebration of the greatness that is George Strait. I saw this concert when it toured my area, so imagine my delight when a DVD was released. Mr. Strait hasn't given us very many video offerings of his work, and this is a star-laden tribute to the music legend, wherein he shows he is still at the top of his game. I wish this had been released on Blu-ray, as it was clearly shot in HD, and lossless audio would have added so much to this, but the content is so exceptional, I didn't mind the lesser format as much. The magic of George Strait and his exceptional talent (in front of over 100,000 people!) is stronger than any technical issue. For a DVD, it looks and sounds just fine, and the music is magical. I highly recommend this release as a gift for any George Strait fan. Bravo, George!",1447804800,5,796,4.3133333333333335

7296305,5,B00ZYBI84U,"What an amazing night for George Strait.  The man's career was (and still is) amazing, and this performance highlights old as well as newer songs.  Guest appearances by Nashville stars neither help nor hurt this show, but George could done this show all on his own, and still would have knocked it out of the park.  He plays for over two and a half hours, and his voice never falters.  One of the great aspects of any great performer is the ability to command a stage without flashy lights and dance moves.  Strait is one of those.  Standing at the mic stand, Strait will occasionally strum his acoustic guitar, but many times simply stand there and sing.  While he didn't write the music, his stage presence and emotional performance is often enough to give the impression that he did.  George can flash a smile and a head tilt at just the right moment during a song that make one forget he didn't write it.  He has such an easy swagger on stage, much like a country Frank Sinatra, that he needs very little staging.  Watching this performance make it easy to see why Strait became such a honky tonk phenom. It's music and performance that works just as well in a huge stadium like the AT&T as it did back in the day when he played little dive bars throughout Texas.  Long live the King.",1446768000,2,1288,4.438297872340425
