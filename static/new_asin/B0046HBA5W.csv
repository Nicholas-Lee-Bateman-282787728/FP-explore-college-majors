8417315,3,B0046HBA5W,"I am a sucker for Zombie films even though most of them tend to wallow near the bottom of the cinema cesspool, (a ripple above the slasher genre). To my surprise this proved to be a reasonably well made Zombie film-all things considered. Sure the acting is a little suspect and the score often reveals it's B-movie origins, BUT this is still a fair to good Zombie film. I won't write a plot synopsis as that has already been provided, however, be prepared to witness a novel entry in Zombie cinema.  WAR OF THE LIVING DEAD, (or ZOMBIE WARS its alternative title), portrays a future where humans are held captive by Zombies, and harvested for food. The film uses both Snyder runners as well as shambling Romero type Zombies which are dispatched by rebel human fighters with a gunshot to the head. ""Purists"" may not take to this change in Zombie ""culture"", though I personally found it a welcome addition in a sea of mediocrity. Yep, you got it, Zombies that can think and plot, at least in a rudimentary manner. Fortunately they don't talk but appear to communicate on some primitive level by way of grunts and growls. The camera work, sound and lighting was professionally executed and belies it's B movie origins. The picture transfer in WAR OF THE LIVING DEAD is quite good and sharp, and it is presented in wide screen. In fact, I often forgot that I was watching a low budget film and found myself wanting more of WAR OF THE LIVING DEAD! I even found myself appreciating some of the characterizations which made it easy to overlook the acting when it was spotty. I was also extremely pleased to see that the FX crew churned out Stage 3 Zombies! You heard it, Stage 3 Zombies... I am tired of seeing white faced make up and raccoon eyed Zombies (with that obligatory drool of blood seeping from the mouth). Cripes, I could whip that up in my kitchen. This is no longer the age of NOTLD, surely we have progressed beyond that vintage Zombie look? To all current and future Zombie film makers, think Stage 3 Zombie and repeat 3 times daily. Do not save money by cutting your special FX. Go big or go home. WOTLD's undead feature some of the best Stage 3 Zombies seen since Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD, (whose undead epitomize the classic Zombie appearance). This only makes sense as some of these corpses have been shuffling around for 50 years, (or so the film indicates). Gore-hounds take note, that there are plenty of head shots and some serious ripping that takes place here. There was an evisceration within the first 15 minutes and the credits rolled with distorted shots of Stage 3s doing their thing. WOTLD is a gore-fest not to be missed and should please most Zombie fans who are not adverse to something different from the usual fare. Finally, the film makers largely strayed from the disastrous and annoying Horror comedy field, by keeping it dark (though fun filled). A solid three stars or more. A welcome entry and recommended, (if you can locate a copy)!",1292976000,,2969,4.60188679245283
