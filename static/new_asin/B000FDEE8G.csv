8120947,2,B000FDEE8G,"You would do well to skip this one.

8120948,2,B000FDEE8G,"Just terrible. Bad everything from Photography to characters to lighting, etc.

Is there anyone out there who can help me understand that point of clothed sex scenes? Childish filmmaking much!",1516060800,,192,5.4
8120949,1,B000FDEE8G,"There are two movies out now with this title.  My guess is the high star ratings are for the other one.  This one is very lame.  I made it one third of the way through, and then slapped myself around for wasting so much of my life.  It is mostly dark, so you cant see anything once they arrive at grandmas house, and its a very cheap made type film.  Cheaper than ever before.",1515456000,,376,4.027027027027027

8120951,5,B000FDEE8G,"I love movies people have never seen or even heard of.. And even tho this is obviously a amateur way of making a movie I loved every bit of it. It kept u wondering what was going on n the ending thru me for a shock...
Loveeee",1428883200,,225,3.8085106382978724

8120953,2,B000FDEE8G,"A group of young adults go to an isolated home, cue spinner...slasher film.

This is a slasher film that involved a group of young teens away to party for the weekend. Luckily grandma owned a pool table. The one kid who wasn't invited was the weird looking guy with the eye make up and black lipstick (Ryan Carty). Seems he was put away for allegedly killing his parents, but now he is out and following the gang.

The characters were rather dry. The conversations were boring as secrets are revealed... My goodness they are high school students. How many freaking secrets can they have?  Anyway the killer may not be who you expect, which is a plus, but the cast of characters were a bore unless maybe you are in high school and a discussion of PMS vs testosterone is entertaining.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.",1388016000,4,823,4.578231292517007
8120954,3,B000FDEE8G,"This movie was much, much better than I expected. My only problem was that most of the action took place in the dark and I had to figure out what was happening. Either their should have been a light source or the action should have taken place at dusk or dawn. The story itself , as well as the writing was good. We did not get to see most of the actual killing, which is not necessarily  a bad thing. The ending was totally surprising as to who the killer actually was, so the added mystery made for a better picture. The characters themselves were well acted, which is not the case in most of the low budget slasher flicks I have seen. There is an actual story in this movie, along with the usual cliche's like the oversexed couple, but the movie is not over sexed or have an  over abundance of the  body-count. The slasher flick is actually more than a slasher flick. It actually had a story. If only it had more lights.",1193097600,7,923,4.232954545454546
