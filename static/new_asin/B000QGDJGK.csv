Old and new fans of the beloved Dark Shadows will finally be able to watch how it all began as MPI Home Video rolls out the first DVD Boxed Set of six of the series' very first episodes. This first DVD boxed set includes the first 35 episodes of the series.

Special features include the original commericals from the first episode, and an interview with Alexandra Moltke Isles, who played Victoria Winters, and an original Dark Shadows promo.

Creator, the late Dan Curtis, literally dreamed the series. He dreamed about a young governess riding on a train en route to a dark, strange and brooding estate. Talking over his dream with his wife and family, Curtis decided to turn it into an incredible soap opera, and the rest is history.

Dark Shadows ran on ABC from 1966 to 1971 and enjoined an iconic fan following similar to Star Trek and Batman, which also both premeired in 1966. Dark Shadows fans continue to hold annual conventions, and many of the actors have formed real and enduring friendships with the fans they've seen each year.

On this DVD boxed set, the Collins Family of Collinsport, Maine, are introduced: Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (portrayed by the legendary screen actress Joan Bennett), who hasn't left her family's great estate, Collinwood, in 18 years because of an enormoust secret; her brother, Roger Collins (played by the fantastic Louis Edmonds), who is vain, a snob and, like his sister, hiding a huge secret; Elizabeth's daughter, Carolyn Stoddard (played wonderfully by Nancy Barrett), who is full of 1960s teen angst; Governess Victoria Winters (played by the aforementioned Alexandra Moltke Isles), a young woman who grew up in a New York foundly home and was unexpectedly and mysteriously offered her post as governess; and Roger's son David Collins (played by David Henesey), who is BEYOND troubled.

Those who live in Collinsport are also introduced in this boxed set: Collinsport Inn Waitress Maggie Evans (played by Kathryn Leigh Scott), who is Vicki's best friend; her artist father and troubled alcoholic, Sam Evans, (played by Mark Allen for seven episodes then the rest of the series by David Ford); successful businessman and Collins Family nemesis Burke Devlin (played to the hilt by Mitch Ryan), who was wrongly convicted to manslaughter and blames Roger Collins; and Collins Plant Manager Bill Malloy (played by Frank Schofield).

The series began as a gothic romance, which this first boxed set portends. But, ratings were poor and the series faced cancellation after only about six months. Dan Curtis has said that he was forced to do something drastic to try and save the show, and drastic he did: he made the series revolve around the supernatural, so he introduced a ghost.

Mr. Curtis said that every time he introduced another supernatural element he was surprized to find that ratings increased markedly, so he decided that he had nothing to lose, since the series was still facing cancellation, and went all the way --- throwing a vampire into the mix in 1967!

The vampire, Barnabas Collins, was played to perfection by classically trained actor Jonathan Frid. The vampire was only to have been a temporary character that would be killed off following a reign of utter terror, but Frid's compelling characterization of a ""sensative"" and remorseful Barnabas was a revelation. Ratings soared, the series was saved, and Frid became an international superstar virtually overnight.

While casual viewers are very familiar with Barnabas, many are unaware that there were wonderful episodes that preceded him. It is truly incredible to be able to watch the progression of the series in these early episodes.

The gothic elements depicted in the episodes in this boxed set remain very entertaining, long before the supernatural plots began.

The core brilliance of what has made this daytime series endure for more than 40 years (and be the only daytime drama to be released on VHS and DVD) is the real emotions and life themes it dealt with: Love, death, fear, longing, revenge, obsession, lies, secrets, loyalty and betrayal.

What made it unique among all daytime dramas is that those themes were played out against a compelling backdrop of Gothic sensibilities that eventually included the 175-year-old guilt-ridden and love-lorn vampire, seances, time travel, ghosts, mystery, murder, intrigue and a constant dose of the unexpected.

This ""soap opera"" managed to transcend its genre by bringing a taste of Gothic horror and science-fiction fantasy to the hum-drum world of the afternoon drama.

But, it was the stellar repertoire cast that made it all work, because they played it straight, and gave some of the most incredible performances ever captured in daytime, and did so under the pressure of the series being virtually produced live!

The series has too many memorable moments to mention. For me, I still remember the beginning voiceover by Alexandra Moltke Isles of the very first episode, released on this set for the first time on DVD:

""My name is Victoria Winters. My journey is just beginning. A journey that I hope will open the doors of life to me, and link my past with my future ... A journey that will bring me to a strange and dark place, to the edge of the sea, high atop Widow's Hill to a place called Collinwood ... A world I've never known, with people I've never met. People who are still only shadows in my mind, but who will soon fill the days and nights of my tomorrows.""",1178928000,285,5655,5.129347826086956

2838032,4,B000QGDJGK,"Strangely addictive, these early episodes draw you in quickly to what became a cult phenomenon. While most people only know about the Barnabas Collins years of the show, it really began as a soap opera with only a slightly spooky and mysterious storyline. It would take several episodes before it started to become something more supernatural. While the series had a fairly low production quality, problematic acting, and truly amazing examples of visible boom-mikes and things running into the cameras, it still proves to be a very entertaining show, especially if you enjoy sitting around with friends and doing your best impression of Mike & The Bots.",1421539200,,654,5.121495327102804

2838047,5,B000QGDJGK,"I couldn't understand why most viewings of Dark Shadows, begin when Barnabas appears. Who wants to begin watching right in the middle of it? I was in Junior High/Middle School when this series first aired. My Mom was a devoted fan and watched it every day. I had a long walk home from school and by the time I arrived home....DS was either over, or right at the end. It must have came on from 3:30 to 4:00 every day. So...That was a long..long time ago and I had not seen the series since then. The complete collection is available, but since I am poor and cannot afford $300 all at once, I selected getting one set a month until my collection was complete.",1412640000,4,657,4.306451612903226
2838048,5,B000QGDJGK,"We bought this series out of love for nostalgia.  It was a good choice.  I have to admit we laugh through some of the episodes but that just makes it more fun.  Our favorite game is trying to guess if anything will happen at all in 20 some minutes.  It's a great way to end the day with  an interesting story and wonderful characters that bring you back to another simpler, untrashy era.",1409011200,,387,4.2465753424657535

I am on box set 8 of the 'Barnabas' episodes, but these early shows are really fun and a great prelude for what is to come.  For some reason, these early episodes were filmed with more outdoor locations, additional sets (for example, the kitchen and morning room of the great house, the hotel etc.) and characters not seen in the later shows.  I must now purchase set 2...",1400803200,,429,4.405063291139241

As a young child, I remember coming home from school and she and a couple of my sisters would watch the soap while I hid behind a chair.

2838054,5,B000QGDJGK,"I watched this collection of the first weeks of Dark Shadows,but some very good camera work pops up right near the end of episode no. 23,coupled with Alexandra Moltke's facial expressions. Namely-the constable Jonas Carter pipes up after David ""accidentally"" dropped the crescent wrench on the floor and then picked it up. The constable says to the effect that David just added to the prints that are already on the wrench. Notice the gaze of Victoria Winters eyes in the direction of the constable. Those eyes say""Yes. That would seem to be right."" The suspicions mount in Victoria's mind and seem to be reaching maturity with a scream. That's some pretty clever high-jinx on David's part. The acting crew carried the scriptwriter's intent very well.",1380153600,,751,5.016
2838055,5,B000QGDJGK,"I remember running home from school to watch Dark Shadows.  My friends and I loved it.  However, I didn't remember the times  before Barnabas came to town.  I purchased this collection and have been watching it with a few of my friends.  We are enjoying it.  It is always fun to see the ""bloopers"" too.  I highly recommend this collection for Dark Shadow fans.  In fact - seeing the first episodes, I see where the recent Dark Shadows' movie found inspiration.",1377907200,2,460,4.592592592592593

2838058,5,B000QGDJGK,"It's a bit campy, there are certainly blunders to count and the audio/visual isn't always the greatest, but it is very entertaining. I'm so excited that there are over 1200 epidsodes to look forward to and am glad they were able to preserve what I saw. I don't recommend this to anyone who is picky about wanting perfect acting and pristine viewing conditions. If you want to step back in time and are willing to allow for a few blips and editing which wasn't allowed it will be a great experience which is hard to space out and not eat up all at once. I loved it and hope everyone else will too.",1373068800,7,596,4.283185840707965

2838060,5,B000QGDJGK,"From the very beginning, Victoria Winters is an intriguing character (who is she, really???). She has just the right about of sweetness mixed with gutsiness. I like her! However, something weird is definitely going on in Collinwood. Why Victoria stays, I don't know. She's not learning a whole lot about her identity. Oh well, it's just fun to see if Burke Devlin and Vickie will finally confess their love for each other and make a go at it. This DVD set is a ""must have"" for Dark Shadows fans.",1370390400,,495,4.573033707865169

2838063,5,B000QGDJGK,"I'd never seen the beginning of Dark Shadows before, and my mother and I are big fans. So we got this when we saw the great deal for the price. The series was slow in the beginning, but still hilarious to watch. I highly recommend. :)",1367193600,,234,4.108695652173913
2838083,5,B000QGDJGK,"Childhood memories are tied up in Dark Shadows.... so it's all about nostalgia, remembering just enough to know we liked it, and forgetting enough to keep it interesting and nearly as compelling as when we were kids.  Of course, it's tests our patience a lot less when we can just move on to the next episode right away!

It was fun to see it from the very beginning.",1365379200,,367,4.382352941176471
2838084,5,B000QGDJGK,"My wife and I started watching this series once again after all these years on Netflix with season 2.  We actually thought that was the beginning of the series since that is what we both remember from when we originally watched that show back then.  When we found out that there was a whole season that came before what we were familiar with, we had to give it a look and so I ordered this first set of that first season.

The quality of the video is quite good.  This part of that season was not recorded live and there is a refinement to everything about the production compared to season 2.  I find the early story line also to be quite good and I have been enjoying getting to know more about the background of these characters.  Neither of us find this early season boring at all.  In fact we find it quite engaging and plan to move on to finish the rest of this first year.",1364428800,6,879,4.196428571428571
2838085,5,B000QGDJGK,"I love the Dark Shadows series for it's quaint ambiance in a Gothic setting and though the characters are a bit stock, they're compelling and very human. And it's refreshing to listen to dialogue that is literate and somewhat formal by today's loose standards. Then there's the story itself; macabre and mysterious---and, yes, sometimes frustrating. But, that's life, isn't it?
I'm so grateful that the flubs and technical errors weren't edited out, for it only adds to the authentic charm that I remember so well from my childhood, when I would walk into the house after school just in time to hear that strange theme music upon entering, telling me Dark Shadows had just begun. And the plugs for other upcoming shows during the end-credits really takes me back!",1362268800,,763,4.922480620155039
2838086,5,B000QGDJGK,"I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas, as she was always telling me what a great series it was when she was growing up.

2838089,5,B000QGDJGK,"Dark Shadows The Beginning really gives you more insight as to the Collins family tragedies and harsh situations they go through!  In reality, I was born in the year 1968.  The earliest I recall ever seeing Dark Shadows is at the age of nine or ten and I loved (as much as a kid could do) the program, not knowing it was a soap opera!  About three years ago, I started out my series collection with the DS that have Barnabas in them, not recalling the series started before then!

The acting and presentation back then was terrible and some of it I find dramatization as humorous.  But the story line is just as I remember it.  It's memory lane for me with my mother waiting for me to watch a soap opera after school.  Good memories and good times.  The beginning counts in Dark Shadows, it was not all about Barnabas even though he became everyone's favorite.

This show is strangely addicting. I love the classic and gloomy look, and how the next episode takes place right where the last one ended. It's a shame that some people diss these episodes and skip right to Barnabas, because I thought these were some great classic episodes. Burke Devlin was my absolute favorite character.

A woman named Victoria Winters is asked to come to Collinsport, Maine to be a Governess to snobby obnoxious 9 year old David Collins. She arrives by train as the same time Burke Devlin arrives. Burke has a history with the Collins family. He's charming, but he's definitely up to something. He will manipulate anyone to get what he wants. Roger Collins assumes Burke is back for revenge. What is Burke up to? Why did Roger Collins's brakes in his car mess up? Why did Elizabeth Collins ask Victoria to come to Collinwood?

It's a subversive 1960s/early 70s phenomenon, a wonderfully campy, gothic epic, not a ""soap."" The narrative isn't always speedy, but the coastal spooks of New England's mysterious Maine captivate viewers in a languorous spirit-fog. Thank goodness for perpetually dark and stormy nights. The dark half of the year isn't long enough for those who welcome autumn leaves, ghosts, and Halloween. I never saw ""Dark Shadows"" as a child; what an enormous bounty to have discovered it now. I grew up in a haunted house on a ruined estate, with roads twisting into kudzu, mysterious gates in the woods, leading nowhere, and real live ghosts. Those with imagination will appreciate the Gothic delights of ""Dark Shadows,"" where the mundane and ordinary mix with the extraordinary.

Remember, this is to us as the Civil War was to those in 1910, which makes the accomplishment of ""Dark Shadows"" all the more notable. The ""Beginning"" gently delves in a darkness flavored by film director Val Lewton's artistic sensibilities. As the saga unfolds, it's a treat to observe the details in Sy Tomashoff's amazing sets, and Ramse Mostoller's costumes. Film noir director Fritz Lang was an avid fan, having worked with the marvelous Joan Bennett; Dan Curtis was inspired in ""Dark Shadows"" by Lang's film, starring Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Beyond-the-Door/dp/B0089LT800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Beyond the Door</a>. The underrated Bennett's talent and tremendous charisma boldly emerge in her films. As matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, she just gets better as the series progresses, with her warmth and dry humor, and her fierce protectiveness of her daughter Carolyn (the remarkably talented Nancy Barrett). What expressive wringing of hands, what a regal coiffure. And what courage on her part to commit to such an eccentric, demanding project as ""Dark Shadows.""

Rather than jump into the post-Barnabas series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Collection-1/dp/B0070B9RVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows Collection 1</a>&nbsp;-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Collection-26/dp/B0070B9RRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows Collection 26</a>, ""The Beginning"" carefully builds a foundation for the later twists. Beginning with the ordinary only adds to the timeless authenticity of the complete series. This early work adds to the overall tapestry of ""Dark Shadows,"" and differs from DS after Barnabas. It's a timepiece with a slower tempo, each careful increment leads to the later spook-fest. Begin at the ""Beginning,"" Collections 1 -6, with it's carefully constructed, solid foundation of family secrets, before the supernatural becomes an even larger focus with the arrival of cousin Barnabas Collins, vampire. Time is not linear in Collinsport, and it's especially jumbled on the Collinwood estate. Inside the Collinwood mansion, heated discussions take place before constantly roaring fires and innumerable pots of tea. From Collinwood, Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke is perfection) opens each episode, describing the threatening atmosphere. Ghosts of Collins ancestors roam the mansion, a ""cat"" enters the mansion and drops a book on the floor, startling Victoria and Carolyn. Vicki searches for her roots, while her charge, young David, threatens her, and has lethal intent regarding his father, the arch, brandy-swilling, silk-jacket adorned Roger Collins (delightfully played by Louis Edmonds). Burke Devlin (Mitchell Ryan is great, wish he'd remained throughout the entire saga) seeks to wreak havoc and revenge on the Collins family, due to his unjust imprisonment years ago, while that stalwart bastion of integrity, Collins fishing fleet manager Bill Malloy, tries to untangle the web of lies surrounding the case. Matthew Morgan is compulsively protective of his employer, Mrs. Collins Stoddard, resenting the intrusion of a newcomer in the naive form of Victoria. Carolyn is fixated by the dangerous Burke, disregarding her attentive boyfriend, Joe Haskell. In an ennui of smoke, ashes, and burning cigarettes, the citizens of Collinsport, Maine, cope. Maggie Evans (superbly played by Katheryn Leigh Scott) works hard in the Collinsport Inn's diner/soda fountain. Notice the delightful menus, grilled-cheese sandwiches, hamburgers, and vintage low prices. All is as normal as Maggie's apple pie and cheap coffee, but an imminent darkness edges the diner's boundaries with creepy suspense. Inside the diner, glossy cheeriness provides respite, while the Blue Whale Bar boasts a groovy jukebox with a repetitive, relentless bleat. Real telephones aggressively ring, and vintage cars park outside. The 1960s couture and coifs fascinate. The writing is remarkable, the outside-shots revolutionary for their time, and the black & white format is enhanced by the ornate sets. Collinsport is a fully realized little world. Be patient, and your budding addiction will be rewarded. Why is ""Dark Shadows"" so relaxing? Perhaps it's that the denizens of the murky environs of Collinsport aren't too concerned with normal life, just things that go bump in the night.

I crave Maggie's 1960s era grilled-cheese sandwiches, with white bread and slices of American cheese, and a side of tomato soup. Stock up on groceries, like Collinsport clam chowder and ingredients for sandwiches, to sustain yourself during your ""Dark Shadows"" journey. An inexorable spell is cast on viewers, you may find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over, unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport. Warning: after hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Don't worry, just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and find comfort in that this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again.

My wife and I always liked old scary movies so we decided to give this a try. We became hooked and ended up buying the entire series. What we love about this series is the small coastal town setting, pre cellphones and computers, seemingly cut off from the rest of the world. It's spooky in a 1960's kinda way, simple, low budget, well written and great characters. This is so much fun to watch that I envy anyone who gets to enjoy the experience the first time through. Watch for the camera and microphone mishaps, actors and/or crew sneaking around in the background, botched lines, etc. It's all part of the fun of watching this incredible piece of American Television history.

2838135,5,B000QGDJGK,"In 1966 ABC was trying desperately to compete with CBS and their huge array of hit soap operas that aired during the daylight hours. In June, 1966 ""Dark Shadows' debut replacing the youth-oriented serial ""Never Too Young"". What was about to happen even shocked most network executives.

 ""Dark Shadows"" is the most unusual of all daytime dramas in that its plots dealt with supernatural elements and storylines, plots that were never seen on daytime TV before. The serial shot up in the Nielsens, especially after the arrival of Barnabas in April, 1967, however in 1966 that was still 10 months away.

 The soap opera started off pretty quietly introducing the audience to a mysterious family called the Collins who lives at Collingwood, a large estate somewhere on the coast of Maine. Filmed in black and white with its stories moving at a snails pace (the custom for 1960's soaps) very few watch the show.

 In this set fans can relive the very first 35 episodes that aired between the end of June 1966 and August 1966. What is really thrilling is the chance to watch the pilot episode along with its original ABC network commercials.",1332028800,87,1136,4.8

Instead of playing it safe it introduced vampires, werewolves, ghosts, time travel, dimensional portholes and a psychotic little child that would love to be there when you die (and give you a little shove down the stairs to boot).

With low budgets, every mistake was recorded for all to see, and that's all before Barnabas Collins shows up after episode 200 (the entire series goes for more than 700 episodes).

It's funny watching the errors in production, the missed lines the missed marks, but I am older than I was then and the main story line has nothing to do with vampires and it is outstanding; man gets convicted wrongly, serves time, becomes rich and comes back home to straighten things out.

I am in the middle of Collection 3 with number 4 sitting unwrapped and ready to go. My wife has been notified that I would like number 5 & 6 for Christmas, and the first 40 episodes with Barnabas are downloaded and waiting their turn.

(The series started broadcasting two weeks before I arrived, its fun to see the episode from the day I was born.)  My mom was, if not really a fan, simply had the show running before or after another soap she watched.  Perhaps to keep me entertained, as I'm told I loved this show.

About this box set:  I really, truly appreciate the producers' decision to present the *ENTIRE* master tape, even where it can't be restored completely.  That is wonderful!  Variations in the quality don't bother me, I want to see the entire episode.  They've even kept in the take boards at the beginning.  The soundtrack is great-- I've always liked how they used the score with the story action, especially in the B&W era of soaps generally.

The writing is just taking off, characters are being developed, and the show is finding its way.  I love seeing the fashions, hairstyles (is there enough hairspray in the world to really do those bouffants?), old phones, etc.  True Americana TV, complete with Carolyn referring to the House of Usher.  The (old) SciFi channel ran this first season, oh, a long time ago and I couldn't miss it then-- its great to have it on dvd now!

This is a fantastic look back to the very first episode(s), with Victoria Winters getting off of the train at Collinsport - the only passenger to disembark there except for Burke Devlin , mysterious ex-con returning to his hometown a wealthy businessman intent on destroying the Collins family.

It's also a fascinating look back to black and white TV, and a surprising number of exterior shots of Collinsport.

What I found truly hilarious was the character of Maggie Evans.  Here she is a wise-cracking, gum-smacking wig-wearing waitress before her eventual evolution to the doe-eyed Maggie who falls victim to Barnabas, and of course, is Josette Du Pres, when the flashback to 1795 happens (much later in the series).

Go back in time and see the local kids dancing to the groovy music at the Blue Whale.  Speaking of which, buy the soundtrack CD - it's awesome.",1290988800,3,1002,4.899408284023669

I was first attracted to the show because of vampires , ghosts , and the like , but I enjoyed these earlier episodes even without that . It is more to do with why the Burke Devlin character returned to Collinsport , and why the Victoria Winters character came to work as a governess for the Collins family . There was a great bonus on disc 4 : the first episode is shown as it originally aired , with the commercials from 1966 included . That brought back many memories .

2838149,5,B000QGDJGK,"I'm way too young to have seen Dark Shadows on TV, but I discovered it accidentally through a website and immediately felt that I'd love this series. Watching it on DVD I quickly discovered that was true! This DVD set is a beauty, giving you the very first episodes of this wonderful series, starting with Victoria Winters' arrival in Collinsport.

If you're a long time fan, you'll definitely want this and all the other DVD boxes!
If you're like me, and watch this for the first time, you'll most likely end up hooked and buying the other DVD boxes! And it'll be worth it! :)

The bonuses on this set are very nice, and the quality of the audio and video is as good as can be expected from something over 40 years old. MPI warns us that they have chosen to present the episodes as they are, without any attempts at enhancing anything. In my opinion that's a wise choice, since the quality is overall good and any ""digital remastering"" of these would be a waste of time. It's a soap from the late 60s - view it as such! :)",1255046400,5,1023,4.322916666666667
2838150,5,B000QGDJGK,"The dark half of the year isn't long enough for those who welcome autumn leaves, ghosts, and Halloween. I never saw ""Dark Shadows"" as a child; what an enormous bounty to have discovered it now. I lived in a haunted Victorian house; those with imagination will appreciate the Gothic delights of ""Dark Shadows,"" where the mundane and ordinary mix with the extraordinary.

Collinsport is a fully realized little world. ""The Beginning"" is even better the second go around, knowing what lurks in the separate Barnabas portion of the saga. Maggie's soda-fountain, with its delightful menus (notice the grilled cheese sandwiches, the ubiquitous hamburgers, the authentic soft white bread, and the vintage low prices) is as normal as apple pie but not, an imminent darkness edges the diner's boundaries with gentle and creepy suspense.

It's fascinating to set aside the contemporary lens of ""Buffy"" (almost ruined by the revenge of the nerds), ""Angel,"" and Anne Rice. ""Dark Shadows"" is the original gothic, with British sensibilities sepia-tinted with the coastal spooks of New England's Maine. The narrative is not always speedy, but it envelopes and captivates viewers in a languorous spirit-fog. Thank goodness for perpetually dark and stormy nights. A warning: after hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Don't worry, just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and find comfort in that this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again.

In an ennui of smoke, ashes, and burning cigarettes, the citizens of Collinsport cope. The writing is remarkable, the outside-shots revolutionary for their time, and the black & white format is enhanced by the ornate sets. The opening lines of Victoria Winters cast their spell amongst crashing waves and hulking gothic hovels. Enjoy that soda-fountain: stock-up on clam chowder & crackers, and ingredients for sandwiches, or you might get really hungry. The narrative is remarkably timeless, though the couture and coifs are delightfully dated. The cast imbibes innumerable cups of cheap coffee with crime-plots. There is a ""groovy"" jukebox, real telephones aggressively ring, and vintage cars crash. Remember, this is to us as the Civil War was to those in 1910, which makes the accomplishment of ""Dark Shadows"" all the more notable.

Be patient, the later series collections delve in the darkness of Val Lewton's artistic sensibilities, your budding addiction will be rewarded. You might wonder where all the ghouls and horrors are. This early ""Dark Shadows"" differs very much from the Shadows After Barnabas, it's a timepiece with a slower tempo, each careful increment leads to the eventual Spook-Fest. The mundane and ordinary mix with the extraordinary. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't see this series as a child, or know that Barnabas Collins doesn't enter ""Dark Shadows"" until after the 6 boxes of the Beginning Collection. This pre-Barnabas ""Beginning"" carefully constructs family secrets with a solid foundation for the later vampiric carapace, yet has a timeless, classic quality of its own. By the end of the Beginning Series Box 2, another haunted house on the Collins estate is introduced, and a ghost emerges.

The narrative is remarkably timeless. The 1960s couture and coifs fascinate. The soda-fountain's ice-cream sundaes look suspiciously flat, though I could eat one of Maggie's grilled cheese and soup specials right now. The Blue Whale Bar boasts a groovy jukebox with a relentless bleat. Although he suffers an affliction of peculiar face makeup, Thayer David is wonderful as Matthew Morgan, a man draped in rage, while Mitchell Ryan is pitch-perfect. The child actor David Henesy displays amazing talent. I've become a huge fan of Joan Bennett. She just gets better, with her maternal warmth and dry humor. What expressive wringing of hands, what a regal coiffure. And what courage on her part to commit to such an eccentric project as ""Dark Shadows."" Clarice Blackburn, Nancy Barrett, and all the cast of the little horror repertory company are simply amazing. Their acting holds up today and even exceeds most standards; they are anything but afflicted with contemporary flat-affect shallowness.

A haunted house and a ghost emerge by the end of ""The Beginning"" Box 2. An inexorable spell is cast on viewers, you'll find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over. You may find yourself unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport, and be glad you stocked up on food and other supplies. Box 3 focuses on Victoria in peril, and things really begin to hum with ""The Beginning"" 4, 5, and 6, where the pace quickens. After the inexorable anger of Matthew, David's bizarre, obsessive mother from another dimension arrives. Is it any wonder Roger has issues? The mundane web woven in this collection creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Interviews with Alexandra Moltke are wonderfully informative as to the pleasures and the pressures of the cast and crew, as are the rest of the marvelous cast, Nancy Barrett, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Mitchell Ryan, Conard Fowkes, etc. How I wish Joan Bennett could have interviewed. What a lady. Rather than jump into the series post-Barnabas, ""The Beginning"" carefully builds a foundation for the later twists. Beginning with the ordinary only adds to the timeless authenticity of the complete series. This early work is worth understanding as part of the overall, twisted tapestry of the immensely rewarding accomplishment of ""Dark Shadows."" Bon voyage...",1255046400,14,5608,5.225555555555555

If you are not a DS groupie, you might find these a bit boring and slow moving.  However, they really create the background for the more exciting Barnabas episodes which follow.

These videos are a great value.  I have no complaints on their quality, but remember that they were taped in a different era, with a low budget, and at a fast pace.",1253318400,3,482,4.431818181818182
2838152,2,B000QGDJGK,"Dark Shadows is best remembered for the character of Barnabas Collins but what many forget is that Barnabas was not one of the original characters on the show. The pre-Barnabas episodes have often been neglected and forgotten, but now MPI Home Video has made them available on DVD allowing fans to watch Dark Shadows as it was originaly broadcast from start to finish
Dark Shadows: The Beginning Collection 1 contains the first thirty-five episodes of the show and introduces a host of characters who will soon become familiar including; Elizabeth Collins Stoddard matriarch of the Collins family, her boorish brother Roger, Elizabeth's angst ridden daughter Carolyn, and Roger's troubled son David.
In addition, we meet Victoria Winters who has been retained by Elizabeth to serve as governess to her nephew. Victoria was raised in an orphanage and believes that the secret to her mysterious past lies in Collinsport. We also meet Burke Devlin who has returned to Collinsport after serving time for a crime he may not have committed. Burke was involved in a car accident with his former friend Roger that took the life of an innocent bystander and he is convinced that Roger was the one who was responsible for the accident.
Much of the resulting plot is driven by the rising tension between Devlin and the Collins family. Burke has become a rich man over the past five years and he is determined to use every took at his disposal to destroy Roger and his family. When Roger is nearly killed in a car crash, the tensions between them are only exacerbated.
Some fans may find these developments rather pedestrian considering Dark Shadows reputation for supernatural intrigue and mystery and there are times when the story moves slowly and dialogue becomes repetitive, but fans who remain patient will be rewarded. Indeed, part of the enjoyment of watching these early episodes is anticipation of what is to come.
Collection 1 also contains several bonus features including an interview with Alexandra Molke, who played Victoria and the first episode of the series complete with its original commercials.",1250294400,3,2103,5.045977011494253

Although these episodes are way before the famous episodes I still enjoyed them none the less.

I enjoyed these early episodes so much I went online and bought the 3rd boxset in The Beginning Collecetion.

Even though this series starts off much like a typical soap opera it's so much more than an average soap.

Im really looking forward to purchasing the rest of the series and to enjoy this gothic soap unfold before my very eyes.

2838154,5,B000QGDJGK,"One of the best television programs to come out of the 1960's, the brainchild of Dan Curtis was a revolutionary break from what daytime television was and changed the way the soap opera was considered!  It focused around the mysterious, wealthy Collins family.  A family that housed many dark secrets.  An innocent young lady named Victoria Winters arrived to be a governess for a spoiled brat rich kid named David Collins.

His Aunt, Elizabeth is the patriarch of the family and she has her own secrets, forbidding Victoria to enter the Collinwood (the name of the family mansion) basement.  The audience seems to suspect that Elizabeth may have murdered her husband and buried him in the basement and that Victoria may be Elizabeth's illegitimate child.  As the show moved along we have David playing with his father's (Roger) brakes, which almost kills him.  Roger has his own issues and has been blackmailing Burke Devlin.

Curtis was ready to dump the show because at the beginning the ratings were not too good.  He decided to add a ghost to the story (what's and old mansion without a ghost?).  This immediately caused the ratings to go up.  Then Curtis came up with one of the most inovative ideas to daytime tv and that was to introduce a vampire to the plot.  The vampire arrives mysteriously and bears an amazing resemblence to one of the Collins' ancestors as well as the same eerie name of Barnabas Collins.

This stroke of genious shot up the ratings and with the later introduction of Quentin Collins the show became number one and not only had older people watching but many school kids would rush home from classes everyday so they could follow the show.  The show later became the first tv show to reach the big screen with the movie House of Dark Shadows followed by Night of Dark Shadows.

All told, along with Star Trek, Dark Shadows went on to change what was expected of television and spawned legions of fans and fan conventions many years after the show was cancelled.  Today, Johnny Depp owns the Dark Shadows franchise and it is expected that he will launch a new film with himself as Barnabas Collins soon!",1242950400,2,2134,4.711590296495957

2838156,4,B000QGDJGK,"Having seen the 35 or so episodes that comprise ""Dark Shadows- The Beginning, Volume One"", I'm amazed that these initial episodes of the famous cult soap opera were bastardized and hidden for many years.  Why?  Because they're perfectly fine and entertaining installments of the series.  In fact, here's what genuinely surprised me about these ""Dark Shadows"" kick-off episodes:

1)  They're crisp and clean looking.  Whatever the recording technology was at the time, it served these episodes well.  They're all in crisp, clear, black & white, with nary an instance of murkiness or other technical difficuties.  So, if you were afraid that these ""really old episodes"" would look bad on DVD, fear not.

2)  The story is interesting and compelling from the outset.  No, there's nothing supernatural going on (aside from a few vague suggestions that things beyond the natural sometimes occur in the great house at Collinwood), but there's a nice ""Jane Eyre"" vibe as young Victoria Winters assumes her position as governess at Collinwood and tries to figure out why she was offered the position in the first place.  And young David, truly a disturbing, dangerous, brat here, is actually much more interesting than the calm, more well-adjusted David seen in the later, more familiar episodes.  Hey, it's all about being entertained.

3)  Production values are generally excellent.  Acting and production flubs (a bit of a problem in later episodes) are minimal here, and there's actually fairly lavish production detail across the board.  We get ample outdoor scenes, a variety of sets, and other value-added details.  It was clear that the producers truly wanted to impress with these initial episodes.

Are there elements of the shows that are less than totally impressive?  Sure.  This was 1960's daytime television, after all.  For example, the plotline involving the tampered brakes on Roger Collins' car goes on way too long, and is eye-rollingly predictable, but other, more interesting plotlines are addressed during those episodes, too, so boredom never becomes a huge factor.  And production flubs, alas, weren't totally absent.

But overall, these initial episodes from the ""first daytime suspense drama"" (as the series is referred to in one of the promotional commercials included in the set's handful of special features) is solid entertainment, even forty-plus years later after its debut.  Again, it's mystifying to me that these initial 200-some episodes have been shunted aside and packaged after the fact as a separate ""Dark Shadows- The Beginning"" series of DVD collections instead of being released at the outset when ""Dark Shadows"" hit DVD.  But, no matter, at least they're available now.

Like the thirty-some DVD collections of the episodes featuring vampire Barnabas Collins and other supernatural elements, this set features a generous amount of special features, mainly comprised of interviews with cast members.  I also enjoyed the opportunity to view the very first episode of ""Dark Shadows"" complete with the original commercials that accompanied it.  Boy, were commercials dumb in those days.

Anyway, I'll conclude with my usual sign-off when I enjoy a particular collection of television shows on DVD: I liked this collection of episodes a lot, and am enthusiastically aboard for the next volume.",1240444800,7,3324,5.30019120458891
2838157,5,B000QGDJGK,"I started with Volume 1, but will eventually be buying the entire set of the ""Dark Shadows"" DVDs. When I initially started watching DS, the show was in color and Barnabas Collins (Frid) was already well-established. I had no idea the show started out in black and white and didn't actually know the beginning story of the series.

For those of you who haven't seen ""Dark Shadows"", it's the tale of Collinsport, Maine, a shipping and canning town mostly founded by the Collins family.

The story starts with a typical Gothic twist, orphaned Victoria Winters (Alexandra Isles) comes to Collinswood, the ancient castle the Collins family built in the previous century, to take care of young David Collins.

What she doesn't know is why she was picked for the job or who recommended her, but she has a feeling Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Joan Bennet) the matriarch of the household is not being entirely forthcoming.

Don't expect contemporary video quality in the early episodes.  This series was filmed low budget and despite its enduring fanbase, it was not entirely possible to restore the originals.  You will get a kick out of the commercials included and despite all that, the story will definitely suck you in.

But the number of discs, and cost, involved made me hesitate to buy, because such things don't always hold up so well over time. So I renewed my membership with Netflix and am renting it through them. I just finished the first disc, it's a great blast from the past. I was too young to recall these very first episodes, so I'm enjoying the build up to the days of Barnabas that I remember watching. It's really cool to watch some true classic TV without all the perfections of today. Especially in this chilly weather!! Curled up in a blankie with a pot of coffee.

I was too young to watch the series when it first came on t.v. but have been hearing about it for years, so decided to rent the disc before making any big investment by buying the whole set. You might try that too just in case. I didn't realize how slow the story was. They are wearing the same clothes for the whole nine episodes and action takes place in 5 places...Victoria's bedroom (no, not the action you are thinking of), the drawing room, a bar, desk at motel. The precept sounded like a gothic novel which I love gothic novels but it is so slow moving. The entire 9 episodes so far have taken place in a 2 day time span. They didn't cut out the goofs like when an actor says a line wrong or almost calls someone by wrong name (ok, that was funny) and I haven't seen any old commercials in my copy but I do hear Bob Eubanks  advertising The Newlywed Game at end of some shows. It is totally in black and white except for interview. The actors themselves are really good though and I enjoy guessing who some of these people are by trying to remember them in later shows...like Arthur from Maude show and Greg's dad from Dharmia and Greg.  Ok, I guess I will go to disc 2 just to see who else was on this show. I think I find the show more fascinating than I thought. Hmm...maybe I will have to hurry through them til I get to Barnabas.

2838162,5,B000QGDJGK,". . . in which I love thee.  I am enjoying the holy hell out of this 1st collection.  The very concept of a gothic soap opera is too good to be believed, but this is indeed a very precious gift from TV land, even with all faults considered.  Because it is a soap opera first, which means character development is less than subtle and the most banal concepts are often regurgitated.  But you will learn to appreciate it for what it is, and please consider the way in which this material was originally delivered (5 days a week for the season), not the way I choose to view it (in marathon sessions).  No doubt, these film and theater actors struggled on a daily basis with live taping of scripts for which there was minimal preparation or rehearsal.  There are many acting and production gaffes, but that just adds to the charm.  What keeps me so attached is the personal charisma of the principals.  Long after you've grown weary of the big deal about Burke Devlin you'll still get a kick out of Mitchell Ryan's portrayal.  You might also lose yourself madly in the brunette tresses and innocence that is Victoria Winters.  The opening voiceovers range from dark campy goodness to the profound, and who can live without the crashing waves and eerie music that complement the title sequence?  With almost 1200 episodes to go (this set covers 1 - 35), I can see this will be a moderately expensive but infinitely pleasurable love affair.

Granted, the acting isn't the best, although I've seen much worse, and the budget was minuscule. Despite all that, the story demanded attention. I just wish I had been born about 15 years earlier so I could have enjoyed it first run. This box set is an excellent collection.

2838169,4,B000QGDJGK,"I bought this boxed set without having seen any Dark Shadows episodes before.  It turned out to be one of the best DVD buys I've made in recent years.  No tv show to date has done such a wonderful job with the gothic horror genre like Dark Shadows.  The characters are very believable and the most despicable character (Roger Collins) is also somehow the most endearing.  The unintentional humor factor also rides high with the onset gaffes that show just how low the budget was.  The occasional microphone shadow just adds one more shadow to say, ""WHAT WAS THAT!!""  This show has more appeal than to those who love gothic horror, but to anyone who likes to watch characters who are not entirely good, but not evil.",1203724800,2,715,4.590551181102362

The characters are interesting so far and I hope I will eventually find out Victoria's secret of her birth! Roger Collins is almost too much a sterotype of a snobbish, cold man-he could show a bit more humanity! I am also impressed by David the boy's acting ability. The plot is entertaining although a bit slow moving at times.
***I agree with another viewer that the series needs subtitles for hearing impaired so more viewers could enjoy it.",1201392000,,564,4.594059405940594
2838181,5,B000QGDJGK,"Though it is surely oxmoronic to refer to any soap opera as ""good"", the early episodes of ""Dark Shadows,"" warrant attention if only for the reason that they have been unfairly ignored in favor of the post Barnabas period.

While it is unquestionably true that Mr. Frid and Grayson Hall provided the shows missing ingredients--that which gave this dish its much needed sizzle, the pre-Barnabas period does in fact exhibit atmospheric characteristics that are (yes) superior to that which followed.

This accrues from production values that depended heavily on, in studio, deep focus, black and white photography, cleverly fused with outdoor location footage, shot on the Northeastern sea board (standing in for Collinsport Maine).

Thus, we are treated to shots such as Collinwood mansion in heavy rain, a hand reaching out to clutch Victoria Winters as she stands on a precipice overlooking the ocean, a body floating amidst the seas crashing waves, characters in lonely walks on the seashore, David Collins peering mournfully from a casement window as a car speeds by, the ghost of Josette capering amidst the towering pillars etc, etc.

Important to recall, is the fact that the program, at this early phase, was conceived, framed and presented as a gothic romance abounding with supernatural possibilites. Indeed, in its initial review, the ""St. Anthony Messenger"" (October 1966) considered the program ""a cross between 'Peyton Place' and 'Jane Eyre'..."" filled with ""soulful looks"" and ""pregnant pauses..."", whilst the ""Courier Journal"" saw in it a likeness to a ""road show 'Cat and the Canary'"". One might add here a healthy portion of Du Maurier's ""Rebecca,"" as well.

In word--atmosphere--something not even an admirer would remotely attach to the cliched parade of Barbie and Ken dolls, in 25 second scenes, that constitutes, (by all accounts) the contemporary daytime serial.

In order to adhere to such literary trappings, DS emphasized its singular settings, (especially Collinwood with its stained glass windows, velvet portieres, wrought iron chandeliers, baroque long case clock, and panelled drawing room, as well as Robert Cobert's eerie and highly unusual music score.

The addition of vampires and the resultant ratings success resulted, (as often happens) in aesthetic decline. Thus, when the program switched to color, (and fuzzy zoom lens shooting)such ambitious location footage was abandoned, and the show traded in its mise en scene for cheap jack color slides which depicted Collinwood in bright sunshine--without regard to the season of the year in which the program was broadcast. Moreover, as depicted by the new color cameras, and burdened with over-lighting, the once vast seeming sets appeared claustrophobic, hastily dressed, and repetitive.

Not that the first year is perfect. The story line centering on Burke Devlin's return to Collinsport is tedious at best, focusing as it does on a character and situation that is without interest in both conception and presentation-and which asks the audience to believe that a handsome young millionaire would hole himself up, for 18 months, in a third rate bed and breakfast with fiberglass drapes--a premise even more preposterous than the 1970 Leviathon story line.

But for this the cast cannot be faulted. Indeed, the players troup (mostly) admirably with often less than first rate material. Certainly, Alexandre Moltke is a plucky and winsome heroine, and the camera savors her high cheek boned, glossy haired femininity to maximum advantage. Nancy Barrett is likewise dishy and waspish in an interesting characterization, and Louis Edmonds sneers as convincingly as George Sanders, whose vocal inflections he convincingly replicates.

As for the star, the show was indeed fortunate in securing the still beauteous Joan Bennett--a leading lady of the golden age of movies, and one of the best dressed women of all time--a real coup by daytime TV standards of the time. If Miss Bennett's temperement is a bit too phlegmatic for the chatelaine of a house that goes bump in the night, she does, notwithstanding, exhibit the same droll chic that so fascinated Fritz Lang.

Above all else, what she leant the show was prestige--and what a pleasure it is to see her, beautifully coiffed, descending the staircase in flowing floor length chiffon! Certainly she merits the hand kissing her cousin Barnabas would later prove himself to be so fond of bestowing.

All in all, and whatever its demerits, the first year of ""Dark Shadows"" is well worth catching, since, at least, in these early days, the show is
still visually true to its title.",1200182400,6,4614,5.2540760869565215

2838184,5,B000QGDJGK,"I really enjoyed seeing this collection and knowing how Dark Shadows started out.  I had watched many of the episodes on the Sci-Fi channel in syndication but never knew how it all began. Even without Barnabas, these episodes were thrilling and enjoyable.  I love the episodes being in black and white too; I think it really enhances the gothic nature of the series.  This set focuses on Victoria Winters as she focuses on finding out more about who she is and where she came from.  She was an orphan at a girls school and for years had received money from an anonymous source.  Upon getting called for a job at Collinwood, she found out that the town was in close proximity to where the postaged letters had come to her with the money.  She is trying to find out if there is indeed a connection between the two, and she really thinks there is.  The series also focuses on Burke Devlin, who had been sent to prison 10 years prior.  He came back to town and seems to be out for revenge against Roger Collins, who may be responsible for Burke's imprisonment.  I think the scene settings are incredible for that time period. They really enhance the mood of the series. The eerie sound effects also help draw the viewers' attentions.  If you have seen any of the Dark Shadows series, I would highly recommend getting this set.  I have also ordered the Second Collection of the Beginnings as well and am awaiting the other Beginning Collections.  The camera work isn't by far what it is today, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment in watching it. Sometimes the actors/actresses have little mistakes in their lines, but in real life we make mistakes when we speak, so again, this had nothing to do with taking away from the enjoyment of this set.

Dark Shadows, The Beginning, contains episodes 1-35 (June 27, 1966 - August 12, 1966) on 4 discs.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the chapter menus are a little amateur but so what, I wouldn't let that stop you from buying this box set.  How much animation do you really need in selecting an episode?  It was also a good bit cheaper than the previous box sets of Dark Shadows episodes that I have bought which was nice for a change.

These first episodes include Victoria's arrival at Collinwood and her interactions with the odd family members (especially creepy and annoying little David) and locals, and Burke Devlin's return to Collinsport (which stirs up old problems between Sam Evans, Roger Collins, and Burke).

It seems that MPI has done a nice job of cleaning up the old footage (although nothing can be done about the odd lighting choices and poor camera work...but that is part of the charm of Dark Shadows).  It is also nice to see interviews with Alexandra Moltke (Victoria Winters) since she is the main focus of these first episodes.

2838197,4,B000QGDJGK,"The immortal words that began a legacy of fandom for one of the most bizarre, much-loved ground-breaking gothic soap operas ever made....it became most known for one of the first horror/fantasy series to introduce the idea of a guilt-ridden vampire, a tragic hero that broke ground for those who followed...like the popular Angel character in the Buffy series.

Herein lies the more maligned, first year of the soap which was only in its barest means, a gothic soap made in the image of Jane Eyre....volume one begins with the first 35 episodes or seven weeks of the show, beginning with the arrival of young orphan cum governess in Collinsport, a strange Maine coastal town headed by the bizarre, dysfunctional wealthy Collins family. She has been commissioned to work at the ancestral home, Collinwood, as governess to the emotionally troubled ten year old, David Collins(played by David Henesy) by matriarch, Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard (played by Hollywood veteran actress, Joan Bennett)to benefit her alcoholic brother, Roger (played wonderfully by over-the-top actor, Louis Edmonds) Victoria (Alexandra Moltke)is also to be companion to Elizabeth's wild teenage daughter, Carolyn (Nancy Barrett).....these people bring a whole new meaning to skeletons in the closet! Other noteworthy characters to the cast are coffee shop waitress, Maggie Evans (the beautiful Kathryn Leigh Scott), Carolyn's boyfriend, Joe Haskell (Joel Crothers) and Sam Evans (David Ford) Subplots include the return of once falsely accused Burke Devlin (Mitch Ryan) who insists Roger Collins committed the manslaughter and the nearly psychotic episodes of the more than troubled young David Collins. Although many dismissed this early year as pointless drivel, many die-hard fans (I count myself as one!) were rabid for these early installments....there are strong character developments here and good acting....although production values are sometimes strained, lines forgotten, sets falling apart, this is an enduring classic of gothic suspense. The early episodes are a bit drawn out but I believe the stotylines that preceed the eventual addition of Dracula-like family member Barnabas Collins are a must have for all committed fans of the far-out fantasy soap.....with the fantasic prices Amazon has been shelling out on these, snatch them up now!!!",1186444800,58,2330,5.544943820224719

2838200,5,B000QGDJGK,"Unlike other reviewers who feel the need to impress you with their DS knowledge....here's the basics about these dvds:

After OVERCHARGING for these sets (Dark Shadows-The Beginning)on their website, MPI will begin releasing the first year of the series 66-67, the Pre-Barnabas Collins stories, on dvd. Who thought these would be direct sales ONLY from their website? Don't claim what a fan you are by declaring you will pay ""anything"" for these great episodes. If you were such a fan you would have had the VHS like the rest of the ""real fans"" years ago. The point is therefore....pointless! 8/28/07-Now this set is 29.99-who got screwed?

These episodes are in fair condition. The dvd menus are horrible and cheap. Alexandra Moltke's (Victoria Winters) intros & interviews are nice, since the first season does focus on Victoria's arrival at Collinwood and Moltke has been out of the convention circuit for sometime.

Unlike the VHS release of the very first episode, MPI in their ""INFINITE WISDOM"" has edited the original commercials out and repeated the episode with commercials as an extra on a the last disc. Being 41, I liked seeing these old commercials as part of the first episode presentation. How about some new documentary material about the first year? There are tons of fan groups fueling these releases, get those people involved.

Fans will appreciate the more simple ""soap"" plots of season one as well as the  subtle supernatural elements. Diana Millay appears as The Phoenix, a creature who is reborn to die in fire, taking victims with her on each return. This plot line is truly under appreciated.

8196136,5,B000QGDJGK,"OK, there are a lot of good TV shows out there, but Dark Shadows is one that almost everyone has heard of and which has captivated audiences for 50 years. There are so many of us who still remember, as a kid, running home after school to get in front of that TV just in time to hear
that haunting theme and the waves crashing, then the monolog of Victoria Winters which signaled the start of another episode of what is arguably the most unusual and loved soap of all time. The pre Barnabas episodes have always played second fiddle to the later ones with respect to seeing them rerun  on cable or satellite channels. The six DVD sets of Dark Shadows The Beginning now allows many of us, who never got to see all of the pre Barnabas episodes, to finally see how it all started. Being in black and white only enhances the dark mystique of these early Dark Shadows episodes. For any Dark Shadows fan who has not had the chance to see these older episodes, you owe it to yourself to see these. This series never gets old. It brings me back to a time when life was a lot simpler. Personally I have always loved Dark Shadows and still do to this day. I am so glad these early episodes are now on DVD.",1475020800,,1194,4.213973799126638

8196138,5,B000QGDJGK,"At Long Last!!!  The ""Beginning of Dark Shadows"", is now available.  We, the viewers, will finally see, how this wonderful ""Goth"" soap opera, begins.  We are introduced, to Ms. Victoria Winters, on how, and why, she came to work for, the Collins family, of Collins Port. We get to see, how the good natured, Victoria deals with incredible series of events, that, would make most people in her position,  RUN !!!!  The complexities, she finds herself with the Collins, are truly amazing!  Especially, the very disturbed, and in my opinion, very spoiled brat, David Collins, her charge.  Wow, David Collins, is REALLY, A ROTTEN, SPOILED, and VERY DANGEROUS BRAT !!!  Especially, in a temper tantrum, almost kills his father.  By removing his father's brakes on his father's car.  Just because, his father, wants to send him away, from Collin Wood.  For his, David's safety.  Makes you wonder, if his poor father, if he perhaps, on a subconscious level, was worried about really, keeping every one safe from, David!!
This child seems, to be, like, almost evil !!!  What a great con artist !!!!

Heck!!  Even the fellow, Burke Devlin, who is out for revenge, on Roger Collins, who we will learn the reasons why, much later, has to warn, Victoria, watch out for David.  And, HE IS SOOO RIGHT!!!!!!  Can hardly wait to get the other, 5 volumes, for this fantastic series!  I admit, certain parts, of this story line, is a little ,long.  But, it REALLY IS SO GOOD!!!  Just continue with the other 5 volumes of this series.  You will see, what I mean.  WOW!!!",1468108800,,1551,4.730337078651686
8196139,5,B000QGDJGK,A nostalgic series that I missed when I was a teenager because I was in school when it came on TV.  Now I can enjoy it when I've got time on my hands and nothing more important to do.,1465862400,,183,3.6923076923076925

Even my 8 year old who likes things creepy but not too creepy enjoys curling up with me to watch it.",1460073600,,268,3.9814814814814814
