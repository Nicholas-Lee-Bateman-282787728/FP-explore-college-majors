2674176,5,B000JJSRN4,"The brilliant performance by Marilyn Horne in L'Italiana in Algeri proves the worthiness of the assessment by those opera critics who deemed her the best female operatic diva of her time.

Ms. Horne displays her magnificent vocal talents at the peak of her career.  As if to say that pure mezzo tones are not enough, Ms. Horne delivers the comedic lyrics with convincing ease, and firmly fixes our
admiration for her abilities.

No opera fan or Marilyn Horne devotee should be without this DVD.",1199750400,6,494,4.857142857142857
2674177,5,B000JJSRN4,"Rossini was only twenty-one years old when he composed ""L'Italiana in Algeri,"" and this production captures all of his youthful exuberance.  Marilyn Horne is a brilliant Isabella (a role she first sang in 1964), who livens up the ensembles with her own comic touches (`al dente!').  The only ""L'Italiana"" I like better is her 1984 Venetian performance, where she partners with Samuel Ramey as her Mustafa.  A match made in coloratura heaven!

In this 1986 Metropolitan Opera version, Paolo Montarsolo is the overbearing Bey of Algiers.  He sings it as a buffo role, and tends to mug and gesticulate his way through his solos (it's actually a rather difficult coloratura part if sung correctly).  However, this bass comes through in the ensembles, most especially in the septet that fires off at the end of Act I.  Jimmy Levine leads the orchestra, chorus, and principals in a scintillating, clockwork finale (""Din-din, bum-bum, cra-cra, tac-tac!"") where Rossini takes us right to the edge of musical chaos.  Fortunately, the conductor keeps his musicians in laser focus.  If you were bouncing up and down in time with Jimmy throughout the lively overture, take a moment after this first act finale to pay homage to this remarkable musician.

According to Ms. Horne, in her autobiography, ""The Song Continues,"" ""...the reviews [for this production] weren't totally laudatory:  for my singing, yes; for my acting, no.  The `Times' said the production was `vulgar.'""

I think the `Times' was way too harsh.  This Italian girl has lots of sass, bling and zip.  Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's costumes and sets are gorgeous (if a bit well-travelled).  Ms. Horne sings of love, patriotism, and the way to manage men, at the peak of her glorious form.  I was so pleased that she sang Isabella's cavatina ""Per lui chi adoro,"" with the cello obbligato.  She doesn't just sing over the accompaniment, which she could easily do with her imposing voice.  No, Ms. Horne's Isabella somehow makes love with the cello.  I don't know how else to explain that beautiful sound.

The other singers were quite in spirit with this production, although I found Douglas Ahlstedt's tenor a bit dry.  Allan Monk gave a finely-tuned performance in the very thankless role of Isabella's elderly suitor.

If you can only afford one DVD of Rossini's great comic opera, it has to be this one.

2674178,5,B000JJSRN4,Without doubt this is a great production of this opera. There will never be a better one done. Just the singing of Marilyn Horne alone is worth it. And Paolo Montarsolo is another great reason to get this. This is a traditional production ( none of this stark modern nonsense) and is true to the libretto. It is a magnificent production and a feast for both the eyes and the ears.,1187308800,6,380,4.366197183098592
2674179,3,B000JJSRN4,"Unfortunatelly this DVD is not as expected. Singing is only correct (Horne included) and no more than that, as it should have been with this cast. L'Italiana is a comic opera. This production is not comic at all. In few passages you can have some little fun and a light smile. The stage is poor and the costumes awful, the chorus using masks that makes them look stupid instead funny. The Orchestra sounds heavy, again directed by mr. Levine (he directs from Rossini to Wagner and none of them good). Rossini must be directed hopefully by an Italian director and if possible, specialized in Rossini. Someone who makes the music flow and shine at the same time, as Bruno Campanella, to name one.

I have watched many Italianas' DVD at the moment but non of them is as good as it should be. Larmore (Paris Opera), Soffel (Schwetzingen), D'Intino (Italy, with Juan Diego Florez). The last one is more complete. Good singing. The music directed as it should be. but the sets and costumes are the same as this DVD. Anyway, worth it because D'Intino and Florez.

It it is a pity that we do not have the oportunity to see a 1984's production at the Teatro Municipal de Santiago, Chile, sung by Lucia Valentini-Terrani, Enzo Dara, Domenico Trimarchi and the orchestra directed by Bruno Campanella. Even the stage design and costumes are better and more colourfull than this production. The singing and specially the acting, far far better than this, and provoked loud laughs to the audience during the whole opera. Hope that some label could contact Teatro Municipal and bring us the oportunity to listen and see this wonderful and unforgetable production that I was lucky to see live. Is one of those productions that makes you wish that does not end. Really great.",1186099200,9,1758,4.741830065359477
2674180,5,B000JJSRN4,"This is one of my favorite operas. One thing you'll find if you follow the Schirmer libretto is that Lindoro sings an alternative second aria in the second act. This disc features Paolo Montarsolo as Mustafa; Marilyn Horne as Isabella, and James Levine conducted. Considering that this one is 20 years old, the sound quality is excellent, with the mikes right above the stage instead of back in the auditorium.",1184716800,4,410,4.871428571428571
2674181,5,B000JJSRN4,"""Underrated masterpiece"" is a frequently remark about ""La Italiana"". And I certainly agree. Generally considered inferior to ""Il Barbiere de Siviglia"" and ""La Cenerentola"", this early opera buffa contains some of the most charming Rossini music you can imagine, full of beautiful arias and brilliant ensembles. It reminds me Mozart more than the later.

In this 1987 Met recording, Jean Pierre Ponnelle's production shows colourful yet sober, and you can relax on his good taste to resolve every detail, from sets to costumes. No ""modern"" crap here: Mustafa's palace is Moorish, and we can see moor pirates, nice moor veiled girls from the ""seraglio"" and funny looking moor eunuchs, who sing at the very start the haunting chorus ""Serenate il mesto ciglio"", while they are making their usual embroidery.

Horne's voice may not suit everyone ears, partly due to her aggressive low tessitura and resounding chest notes, but she's always musical and accurate, and that's especially  important when singing Rossini. Near her 50's in this DVD, she has some (little) trouble with very high notes, but she excels in every other issue, bravura passages included.  Add her natural sympathy and easiness on the stage and you get a terrific Isabella. In my opinion, her arriving on Act I and next ""Cruda sorte"" delivering is just what defines a great opera artist.

Paolo Montarsolo is a full featured basso buffo, and if he can't sing 100% the fioritura Rossini wrote for the role, he compensates the fact by large with a splendid performance, considering both singing and performing. Though he was past his 60 in this recording, he's an agile Mustafa, looking a lot much younger. It's delightful to watch him absolutely overjoyed with his new degree of Pappataci, singing and dancing in the Lindoro-Taddeo-Mustafa trio ""Fra gli amori e le belleze"". He'll drive more than a good laugh from you, guaranteed.

Alan Monk, which I had never listened before, was quite a surprise for me as Taddeo. He sings in good voice and more than acceptable italianate sound, playing his part undiminished by the bigger-named Isabella and Mustafa.

Douglas Ahlstedt is the weakest link in the chain, mainly because he seems not to be the quick, spicy, Latin light tenor needed for the role. But he does a decent Lindoro, which I consider one of the most difficult tenor roles in Rossini's operas. Lindoro's notes are high, way high, and Ahlstedt gets to sing them all, and right on the pitch. Visually, he looks perhaps a little too thin and boyish besides the other heavier weighted players of the love triangle, Isabella and Taddeo, but all in all, he does the job nicely.

Secondary singers are also good and visually correct, especially graceful Myra Merrit's Elvira, who's moment of glory is of course the tremendous high note in Act I magnificent finale, cheerfully noticed by Horne, who won't let her steal the show and knocks Mustafa out at the very last moment. Prima donna's privileges are well observed here.

Levine guides the Met forces at the best Rossini pace you can imagine, delivering a precise, swift performance since the Overture's first notes to the happy ending. Perhaps in Act I finale he goes a little too fast, turning the original singing intringulis in a rather undistinguishable mumbling, but this is a minor complaint.

Sound quality is good in all 3 modes (2ch, Dolby 5.1 and DTS), 4:3 format picture is bright and clear. Subtitles in spanish are OK.

If you love Rossini masterful blending of humor and music, you can't go wrong with this DVD. Just enjoy it. And don't forget your limoncello.",1183161600,25,3597,4.948590381426202
2674182,5,B000JJSRN4,"GET THIS RECORDING OF ""L'ITALIANA IN ALGERI"" SIMPLY TO SEE AND HEAR MARILYN HORNE IN HER PRIME.  WITH A TECHNIQUE AND COLORATURA THAT DEFIES DESCRIPTION YOU MUST SEE AND HEAR THIS LIVE PERFORMANCE FROM THE METROPOLITAN.  THE OTHER SINGERS ARE GOOD AND THE RECORDING AND PICTURE QUALITY ARE FIRST RATE.

I FIRST SAW MARILYN HORNE LIVE IN BRISBANE/AUSTRALIA IN CONCERT AND WILL NEVER FORGET THE EXPERIENCE OF HEARING THIS REMARKABLE ARTIST LIVE.  THIS IS A FINE TRIBUTE TO HER ARTISTRY.",1178409600,15,484,5.0125
2674183,5,B000JJSRN4,"In his book ""A Night at the Opera,"" Denis Forman, after praising L'Italiana in Algeri, writes: ""But beware, it needs an alpha production, and if the fizz and sparkle are missing, it can go flat and you will wonder what the heck I am going on about."" ""Flat"" describes my reaction to L'Italiana until I watched this DVD. This production has that fizz and sparkle that Forman is referring to. It is present throughout - from Levine and orchestra to the excellent performances from all the players. This is Rossini as it's meant to be performed. Even if, like me, Rossini isn't one of your favorite opera composers, I doubt you'll be able to resist this production. And surprisingly, the picture and sound quality are excellent despite it having been filmed in 1986.

Special mention must be made of Marilyn Horne as Isabella. She just inhabits the role and her singing is extraordinary. Her mezzo voice is rich, creamy, and smooth; and when she hits those higher notes, the coloratura flowing out from her with such incredible ease, it's just spellbinding to listen to.  In addition, the comic moments are made all that more effective by her crisp enunciation (which she's able to maintain no matter how fast the music is going). Strength, beauty, precision, ease. Horne's voice has it all.

The production is full of subtle comedic moments. One of the best occurs in the first act finale when Elvira, played by Myra Merritt, suddenly steps downstage, and lets her soprano voice soar, dominating the ensemble behind her. Horne, good-natured enough to make fun of her star status, turns and gives Merritt a priceless look that communicates that she's overstepping her rank in the cast. But Merritt ignores the look and lets her voice soar again. This time, Horne walks over to her and, with the brush of a hand, shoos her back upstage into the ensemble ""pack."" (This is before Horne decks the poor soul playing Mustafa, bringing Act I to a hilarious close.)

Led by Marilyn Horne, this is a DVD to treasure. (After all, where else can you see an opera star grating parmesan cheese over pasta in perfect time to Rossini's lightening-fast music?)",1177113600,43,2140,4.807065217391305
2674184,5,B000JJSRN4,"Even this product has not been released, I get this video trough free file exchange software, not being other than the Metropolitan broadcasting. Of course, I have to wait the remastering on DVD, because I have a home VHS recording, so while my order doesn't completed, I'll talk about artistical properties of this production.

The first Italiana i watched on TV was the Michael Hampe mechanical production, with coloured stage and dresses, and comic direction in comic scenes. This Ponnelle production, almost a monopoly in biggest opera house (Metropolitan Opera, La Scala, Vienna, Bologna and Torino), is more natural than Hampe one's. Mustafa under Montarsolo is seen more dominated by Isabella's Horne and is in really in love with her even after she fooled him in the quintetto. Horne, the best Isabella in the history, fulfilled all the requirements to play the role of a energic, brave, sexy and nationalist prisoner, even being more than fifty. The rest of the cast histrionically talking don't give big contribution to the Ponnelle's ideas, but they don't disappoint the audiences.

Now. talking about music, i must highlight the reading of the Rossini score by Levine, who incorporate the original version of second act Isabella Cavatina ""Per Lui chi adoro"", with the cello obbligato and a more elaborated ending. In other hand, Lindoro second aria is an alternative aria composed later by Rossini to substitute ""O Come il cor di giubilo"", cavatina not composed by the Pesaro's Swan. Of course, all the music moves in the vertiginous speed of the Levine baton, being a highlight the overture and the stretta of the first act's finale.

A production tip is that lights turn off when the strettas of the finale and quintetto begin, only spotlighting the crazed people.

Horne is coherent with her studio recording and early lives recordings, being a gift for all of us that DG do official this historic moment in opera. The three arias and her duetto are fenomenal, remembering that Per lui chi adoro is sung in original score version. Montarsolo, being more buffo than a basso cantante doesn't achieve the coloratura deployed by other bassi like Ramey, Raimondi, Pertusi and Alaimo, being more evident in ""Gi d'insolito ardore"", which is a little cut. But with his histrionic skills, we can forgive those gaps. The tenor Ahlstedt is not memorable but has the merit of singing the alternative aria in the second act, as i said. Monk was for me a stranger, and while i don't listen him or watch him again, he will continue being a stranger for me. But he doesn't disappoint with his cameo of Taddeo. The girls (being the same couple of girls in Met Carmen playing Frasquita and Mercedes)Elvira and Zulma are Metropolitan stable crew and their screams are good considered to me. I remember Spiro Malas in a legendary studio recording of Elixir d'Amore, to Sutherlad, Pavarotti and Cossa, and I see the Haly role is smaller than his capabilities. Chorus and Orchestra are first rate and I eventually felt happy to enjoy a Ponnelle production, although the simulation of an actual wreckage in the first finale under Hampe, doesn't have comparison, with her Focile campanelli, Gambill martelli, von Kannen auto canyon hits, the  Serra's flying bird moans, the waves dragging all the singers and eventually, the picture of a wrecked vessel done with the Isabella shawl.",1173139200,19,3373,4.984014209591474
2674215,5,B000JJSRN4,Horne's extraordinary technique enables her to perform Isabella to perfection.  She is also embued with a sense of fun and at her best in this comedy,1369353600,2,149,4.730769230769231
2674216,5,B000JJSRN4,"I cannot even describe my joy at the release of this absolutely classic performance of L'italiana in Algieri, the absolute best on DVD.  I was fortunate enough to have watched it more than aonce at the Met, when it was still affordable to the 99%.  No one can ever forget Horne's machine gun stacatto delivery while cooking up a huge batch of very hot (one could see the smoke rising) spaghetti for the lecherous Mustafa, played to the hilt by Paolo Montarsolo  and her lover Lindoro, the incomparable Douglas Ahlstedt.  A Ponelle production with Levine at the helm.  As a bonus, an interview with Horne where sshe details her involvement with the character and the composer.  Pair it with Bartoli's Cenerentola for an afternoon of fun and entertainment (yes, back to back).",1368662400,5,774,4.825757575757576
2674217,5,B000JJSRN4,When Marilyn Horne sings how can it not be great !  She puts her whole self in each role she performs and is always outstanding.  I love to hear her voice for it is filled with excitement and she projects a love for each role she undertakes.  She is just wonderful and seems to grab a hold of you and bring you into the opera.  What a great lady!,1368144000,3,346,3.971014492753623
2674218,5,B000JJSRN4,"Had seen a disappointing production in a ""cinecast"" in a movie theater.... this was a far superior investment.  Excellent performance and recording!  Highly recommended.",1353196800,2,169,6.0
2674219,5,B000JJSRN4,"This production was the very first exposure I've had to this opera, and let me say, it made me a big fan! I've seen a few other comic operas, including the big daddy of them all, Barber of Seville, but none of them have left me as giddy as this L'italiana in Algeri. It is how I think comic opera should be: not just funny, but FUN! I will echo everyone in praising Marilyn Horne, for she truly delivered the goods here. In a bonus interview Horne says performers either have the gift of comedy or not, and that she feels she's got it. I thought she was tooting her own horn but she was also right. Her facial expressions and gestures indicate the years of experience she's had honing her comedic timing in this particular role. I particularly LOVED her antics with Myra Merritt in the Act 1 finale. Merritt goes to the front of the ensemble and lets loose a powerful high C, with Horne giving her a look as if to say, ""what do you think you're doing?"" Merritt does it a second time, but Horne brushes her away. I'm not sure if this was spontaneous or rehearsed, either way it was hilarious. Then of course there's the cheese-grating and ""al dente"" in Act 2!

Even though Marilyn Horne was the main star, credit should also be given to the rest of the fantastic cast. I agree that Douglas Ahlstedt seemed a little uncomfortable with the tessitura of Lindoro but he sang it with verve and aplomb nonetheless.  Allan Monk was awesome as Taddeo and fit the role of the elder travelling companion of Isabella. He sang well and acted well.  Spiro Malas and Diane Kesling made the best out of the minor roles Haly and Zulma respectively, and I thought Myra Merritt was very good as Elvira. I don't quite understand people's criticism of her vocal performance because I actually thought she was quite solid. She had a beautiful, clear, round soprano voice with easy facility in the upper register. She handled the frantic tempo and the high notes of the Act 1 finale superbly (the most difficult music of the role).  And personally, I prefer a soprano with a fuller voice (such as Merritt) as Elvira. Otherwise she gets drowned out in the ensemble like in most recordings.

Then there was Paolo Montarsolo...this is where I feel I need to defend him from folks who criticise his performance.  Vocally, yes he was past his prime but remember he was nearly 61 years old at the time.  So singing the way he did in this performance, he actually did quite well! Not only that, but I think he succeeded where many others fail in comic operas. He was actually very funny!  I've seen a few other Mustafa's available on dvd, and none of them hold a candle to Montarsolo's interpretation of the character.  Montarsolo completely INHABITED the role of Mustafa.  Every single facial expression, gesture and body movement conveyed the absolute silliness of the character (especially the facial expressions!).  From the chauvinism in Act 1, to the Ah CHEEEEEEEEEE in Act 2, to playing around with his spaghetti, it was all marvelously funny.  So overall while the vocal performance wasn't his best, he more than made up for it with his acting.  I'm not saying it was Oscar-worthy, but it most certainly was entertaining, where otherwise it would have ended up wooden/flat like the other Mustafa's on dvd.

As one can tell I value the acting/drama as much as the music.  If you want to hear purely the best singing, there's Horne's audio recording of the complete opera, and there are also live performances with other casts on dvd.  But if you want the complete theatrical experience, where all the performers sink their teeth into their roles, bounce off each other, and radiate their sense of fun so greatly that it becomes palpable, then look no further than this dvd!",1341187200,7,3750,4.625
2674220,4,B000JJSRN4,"Under a careful and loving baton mastered by James Levine, Marilyn Horne excels in her portrayal of Isabella, main character in ""L'Italiana in Algieri"", this early comic masterpiece by Gioachino Rossini, not as brilliant as ""Barbiere di Siviglia"" which would come later, but nevertheless ingenious, funny, and a great vehicle for a star mezzo.
Horne's interpretations of ""Cruda sorte"" and ""Pensa alla patria"" are alone worth the price of the dvd. She also looks great which was not always true due to an occasional overweight. Her figure in this 1986 register was in great shape.
Paolo Montarsolo comes through with his Mustaf even if his timbre is not very pleasant. Buffos Fernando Corena and Spiro Malas --who sings Haly in this performance-- were, I feel, more effective in the role.
The rest of the cast is only sufficient and perhaps one could say not up to the Met standards. We can only take a look at the 2004 Met's cast for ""L'Italiana in Algieri"" of Borodina, Flrez and Furlanetto to stress this point.
However, Marilyn Horne and Levine make this register a very enjoyable one.",1335139200,,1088,4.886486486486486
2674221,4,B000JJSRN4,"First, this is a Deutsche Gramophone production, with subtitles in Italian and multiple translations. It's a first class staging and Horne is of course magnificent. The sound and picture quality are outstanding, and it is truly amusing. Levine's conducting is lively and credible. This is everything a light opera should be. The only criticism I could offer (thus the withholding of the fifth star) is the camera work: the opera was intelligently and wittily staged. A single centered steady camera would have delivered what was there. Ponnelle couldn't resist varied and distracting camera angles, and close ups of a kind that no one needs. I didn't wish to be reminded of Horne's age by seeing her neck that close, or be treated to bulbous, fuzzy-top Levine ""sweatin' to the oldies."" A very minor annoyance, hardly worth the space I'm giving it, but the camera antics are there like a faint background noise you tend to forget is there, but still, there it is.  One certainly wants to *see* this DVD to experience how very well the opera can be staged and played, but ownership may not be necessary. The above flaws would keep me from repeated viewing, when I can hear it without annoy on CD.",1295568000,3,1194,4.796116504854369
2674222,4,B000JJSRN4,"This delightful production has two main things going for it. I. Marilyn Horne's Isabella. 2, Ponnelle's production. In English,the title of this opera is The Italian Girl in Algiers. Isabella is the Italian girl and is the centerpiece of Rossini's youthful comic masterpiece. Horne was a major part of the bel canto revival and still sings beautifully on this 1986 recording. Her comic acting is still superb-just witness the spaghetti scene in Act 2! Ponnelle does a fine job in staging the ensembles. The sets are quite nice. Levine's Met orchestra plays with brio and precision and the chorus is splendid. Why then did I recommend the Arthaus version when I reviewed it? Partly, it is the tenor role of Lindoro. This is not a huge role-after all, Lindoro has only two solo numbers. Ahlstedt is a good musician and acts well. But in his solo numbers i catch myself rooting for him to make it through the numbers. Bel canto style demands that the singer impress us with the beauty of the music and the beauty of the voice-not because they made it through the number! Bruce Ford is a more skilled bel canto stylist. although I point out that current tenors such as Lawrence Brownlee or Juan Diego Flores would probably be even better in the difficult role of Lindoro. The Mustafa's are about equal.  Corbelli is an extra bonus as the Taddeo on the Arthaus version, although Monk is fine on the Levine version. Jennifer Larmore defined the role of Isabella after Horne and she does not disappoint on the Arthaus. If she is not the comic actress Horne is she sings perhaps even better. Listen to those mellifluous low notes! Campanella brings even more Italianate gusto to the Arthaus performance than Levine brings to this one. If you buy one, go with the Arthaus. But then buy this one for Horne and the production!",1275350400,2,1815,4.7075471698113205
2674223,3,B000JJSRN4,"I agree 100% with the other reviewers on the excellence of this production and the 1st rate performance by Marilyn Horne.

But I feel I would like to make a few negative points concerning James Levine:

1. It seems the James Levine cannot perform any opera ""totally"" complete. He almost always makes at least one cut somewhere. In this production, the ""cut"" is near the end of Mustafa's Act I aria. True, Montarsolo might have been a bit past his prime and had some difficulty at times with the more difficult coloratura passages. But there is nothing that demanding about the coda passages in his aria which Levine cut.

2. Levine is inconsistent. He utilizes the original ""cello"" version of Isabella's 1st Act II aria but opts for the later version of Lindoro's Act II aria.

3. Levine is too fast in the strettas, particularly the Act I finale and the Act II Quintet. I noticed several times that the vocalists were not all together in some of the ensembles due to some frantic tempos.",1260057600,15,988,4.628571428571429

8151349,4,B000JJSRN4,"Last year was the bicentennial of the premiere of Rossini's charming ""L'italiana in Algeri,"" and we have here the 1986 production, by the late Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, from the Metropolitan Opera.

It may be difficult for future generations to realize that M.Ponnelle was one of the most controversial stage directors of his time, since most of his filmed oeuvre, such as the production under review, is decidedly tepid.  Would his fascinating interpretations of, say, ""Der fliegende Hollnder"" or ""La traviata"" had been preserved.  That said, this staging does prove his wit and his elegance.  Indeed, it is always a small miracle when Rossini's comedies are not vulgarized.

Marilyn Horne, in the title role, gives a truly virtuosic performance as Isabella.  If Susanne Marsee was the greatest singing-actress among the notable Rossini mezzo-sopranos since World War II, Miss Horne was the greatest technician, with a facility and agility that astonishes.  Not that she was deficient as an actress, however:  Her interpretation is here both commanding and amusing.  The only flaw is that her (unwritten) acuti often sound constricted, and one can only wait for her to descend into her baritonal chest-voice!

The remainder of the cast, Paolo Montarsolo, Douglas Ahlstedt, and Allen Monk, are delightful.

However, the other great performance here, aside from Miss Horne, is the Elvira of Myra Merritt, though she is not listed on the cover of the published DVD.  She is an underrated marvel, as actress and soprano.  One wishes the Met had given her greater opportunities; Miss Merritt is, for this reviewer, in every way preferable to Kathleen Battle, who dominated the Met at the time in a similar rpertoire.

In all, an exciting performance, well conducted by James Levine.",1402876800,3,1774,5.222614840989399
8151350,5,B000JJSRN4,"Rossini's oper is wonderful, light, and a great masterpiece. Marylyn Horne has a fantastic voice. She is incomparable in her voice range. Everyone in this production was excellent, but Marylyn is so good that she stands out above the other singers. You feel somewhat sorry for them because they might not get their full appreciation. There is another version I have on VHS from Vienna on a smaller stage as compared with this production on the large MET stage. Both are great performances, yet different. The MET production brings out the content behind the music more. It is somewhat brutal to think of the reality of how women were treated by Sultans and Pashas.",1395100800,,664,4.833333333333333
8151351,5,B000JJSRN4,The performance is better than the opera. You will never hear an Isabella better than Horne. Alstadt is excellent in the tenor role. All other performers are excellent.,1390262400,,168,5.035714285714286

Have two performances of this opera --- love them both.

Love the opera!",1386288000,,140,4.75
