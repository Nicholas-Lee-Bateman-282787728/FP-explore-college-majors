8531335,3,B008W7JW48,"This set undoubtably brings 5 great Celtics games and if you don't own any of them yet, it's not a bad set to own at all. However, all of the games are available elsewhere:

1984 Eastern Conference Semifinals/Game 7 vs. Knicks:  Found on ""NBA Dynasty Series - Boston Celtics - The Complete History""

1986 NBA Finals/Game 6 vs. Rockets:  Found on ""Boston Celtics: 1985-1986 NBA Champions - Sweet Sixteen (Collector's Edition)""

1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals/Game 7 vs. Hawks:  Found on ""NBA: Larry Bird, A Basketball Legend""

2008 Eastern Conference Semifinals/Game 7 vs. Cavaliers:  Found on ""Boston Celtics - 2007-2008 NBA Champions Special Edition""

2008 NBA Finals/Game 6 vs. Lakers: Found on ""Boston Celtics - 2007-2008 NBA Champions Special Edition""

Some of these sets may be difficult to find in time, indeed already the 2008 champions set can be hard to find and/or pricey. The value of this set overall does depend on how many of these other sets you own (or wish to own). Although the fact these five games are all great games is not in dispute, games like 2010 Game 6 vs Cleveland in the EC finals (James's last game for the Cavs, Rondo triple double) and Game 7 (or indeed, one of Boston's other great wins) in the 2009 first round series vs Chicago would have been welcome additions.

The fact all the content is recycled is all that keeps this series from being a 5 star purchase.",1357430400,16,1399,4.763485477178423
