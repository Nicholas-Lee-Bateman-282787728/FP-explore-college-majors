8693744,5,B00R1QH6OE,This is one of the Best DVD sets on Creation. I highly recommend it.  I especially liked how he shows the possibility of and advanced civilization before the Great Flood of Genesis and he backs it up with scripture.,1472688000,,215,4.512820512820513

8693747,2,B00R1QH6OE,"If you have NEVER approached this topic, this might be OK.  There are some good facts here, but nothing new at all.  Add to this some egregious (IMHO) mistakes and its not really that good.  Some mistakes include: describing an underwater city with columns and building still standing while showing a picture of the Yonaguni monument off Japan which has no such features.  There is the utterly incorrect perspective that all underwater cities and such are pre-flood when they are obviously built on Flood sediments.  He talks about a ""road"" on the USA continental shelf as being ""pre-flood"".  Impossible as the Flood laid down the layers that cover the continents... AND in one of his lectures he talks about the impressive violence of the Flood - so one would think he would understand this.

Beyond this, you would expect that, in light of the title, Giants would be covered extensively, ancient technology would be addressed, and Noah's ark would be described.  First, giants are only covered in the last 3 lectures and there is nothing new.  Its all out there on the Internet.  Noah's Ark IS addressed, but again, its all old info.  He doesn't even include anything that the Answers in Genesis folks have produced, which is interesting, especially as concerns the construction.  As for ""ancient technology"", go ahead and look for it, but you won't find it here unless you count the construction of a large boat that is covered inside and out with pitch.  To include this topic is very misleading.

To make it worse, the preacher apparently tries to be a comedian.  He makes funny voices while insinuating conversations with members of the audience that he knows but to whom we are never introduced.  He also tosses pieces of gum to them.

So, Pastor Crone, 1) try doing all your homework 2) keep the silly attempts at comedy for your non-DVD preaching, they just make you look foolish, and 3) how about actually having ""ancient technology""  in your series that is supposed to include ""ancient technology""?  At least show something that is technological and pre-flood.",1452816000,3,2071,4.882521489971347
8693748,5,B00R1QH6OE,"Excellent DVD set.  Billy Crone is one of the best Pastor's around and his visual way of bringing things across in a Biblical way is wonderful.  Thank you Pastor Crone, we try and share much of your DVD's with our friends/family/anyone who is open to watch this set.",1436227200,3,266,4.520833333333333
