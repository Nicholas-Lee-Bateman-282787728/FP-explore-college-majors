2803300,5,B000OYCMMQ,"This new Leslie Sansone DVD was absolutely worth the wait. I agree with many of the previous reviewers that it is arguably one of her best. The pace is fast - you will definitely work up a sweat and burn some calories with this 50-minute workout. The music IS very repetitive, unfortunately, but is still high energy and well presented. The walk is intensified by several fast-paced intervals of light jogging with a lower-impact example for those who can't handle the high-impact moves. There is, however, very little arm work, so the main focus is aerobic calorie-burning - a few very basic arm movements during the walk to involve the upper body and no weights or other fitness equipment used. And finally! the DVD has divided up the workout into chapters so one can skip around in the workout if necessary and access the different miles individually. There is also a version of the routine included that plays just the music and mutes the conversation for those that don't need the verbal cues. All-in-all this workout is well worth the money. Give it a try!",1181520000,19,1062,4.745945945945946
2803301,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I was a little hesitant to buy this DVD because of a few of the reviews that I read on here, but I took a chance and I am very glad I did. I also own several of Leslie's tapes and have loved all of them so I purchased  this DVD and love it. For those who love Leslie and her positive upbeat personality and her constant motivation then you will enjoy this DVD. I had gotten use to the 4 mile Super Challenge and needed to kick it up a notch and she does that with the Interval Training and the 1 mile Jog DVD that is included in the set. I am now working up a sweat and getting my heart within my target zone. Bottom line, if you love Leslie and any of her workouts then you can't go wrong with this or any of her DVD's.",1181520000,17,720,3.8
2803302,4,B000OYCMMQ,"... go with the three miles!  I like this workout okay, but I wish she had changed up the music a bit from her 2 Fast Miles and 3 Fast Miles workouts.  The boosted walking ""go to"" song -- Everybody -- really got on my nerves after a while.  It would have been a much workout if she could have had different songs for this boosted period, because after about the third time of the same song -- enough!  I also liked the exercisers in the 3 Mile Walk (her old gang) much better than those in the 4 Mile Walk.  However, for a good sweat without a lot of complicated choreography, you can never go wrong with Leslie!",1181174400,23,612,4.109243697478991
2803303,3,B000OYCMMQ,"I have a bunch of her tapes, including the 4 Mile Super Challenge. I figured this tape said Fast Miles, so it would take less time. It's about 10 minutes shorter or so and does incorporate boost walking, her term for jogging. I've only used it once and might feel differently if I get used to it, but I didn't feel like it was her best work. She does the workout in her new studio, which looks almost like a stage to me and with all the room available, everyone looked squashed together. It became more apparent during one of her boost walks when they were jogging up and back and got in each other's way. She had her daughter, niece, the niece's roomate, a friend and some trainers from her studio and I felt like I was watching a tape someone made of one of her workout sessions. It's not a good production, you can see the cameras, and her cues are off more than usual. The stretching at the end is unorganized, because she was so involved in introducing her walkers. I really felt like the workout was thrown together.

If you have a choice between this workout and the Super Challenge, definitely take the Super Challenge. It's energizing, the walkers are seasoned pros and the music is catchy. After I finished this tape, I popped in the One Mile Walk and Jog because I didn't find this workout satisfying.",1181174400,144,1312,4.421487603305785
2803304,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This is a very good workout.  The workout is about 50 minutes and it starts out with a warm up then brisk walking for about 5 minutes or so.  Then Leslie takes you into intervals of brisk walking then jogging.  You brisk walk for three minutes then ""jog"" for two minutes.  You go through five cycles of intervals.  The jogging intervals include jogging in place, jogging back and forth, jumping side leg swings, jumping knee lifts, and jumping kicks.  There are no handweights or other upperbody boosters used during this workout.  If you have done Leslie's ""Walk Jog"" DVD or her really old ""4 Mile Weight Loss Walk"" then you would be familiar with the format of this workout with the intervals.  She stops between intervals 2 and 3 for a very short water break and I welcomed it!  My only complaint is that once the intervals are over she slows the walk way down toward the middle of the 4th mile.  She does this in almost all of her long walks and I really wish she would keep the intensity high right up to the end.

Anyway, I liked the DVD and will definitely be doing it regularly.  It is more intense than the 4 Mile Super Challenge and is good for days when you want to do a hi/lo class with more intensity.",1181174400,80,1214,4.346666666666667
2803305,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I have many of Leslie's DVD and this one is the best so far!!!  This one kicks it up a knotch with interval training.  The interval training alternates a few minutes of walking with a few minutes of boosted walking (jogging) still incorporating her key moves of kicks, side steps, and knee raises.  Definitely puts more power into your workout!!  The workout includes:

5 min. Warm up walk

5 min. fast walking

25 min. interval walking

10 min. fast walking

5 min. cool down stretch

And if you're not up for the full four mile workout you many choose from just 1, 2, 3, or 4 miles at the menu.

What is even more fun is that it includes some great music to ""sing"" along with:  ""I've Got a New Attitude"" and ""I Feel Good"".

Leslie is the best!  I will include her in my workouts for a long time.  She is so inspiring!!",1179964800,40,820,4.233766233766234
2803306,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I have tried many of Leslie's walking dvds, but I have to say that this one is by far the best.  I have never worked up a sweat with any of her previous workouts.  This one had me sweating and loving it.  Her new studio set took me by surprise - it wasn't what I was used to -but after about 5 minutes I was so into the walking I didn't care what the set looked like.  I love the intervals and the music this time was great.  My favorite sections were the booster walking - which is really a jog.  I did the entire workout all the way through - and had so much energy it made even my Monday morning blues disappear.  This was is a KEEPER!!!!!!!!!!",1179705600,81,647,3.9689922480620154
2803400,5,B000OYCMMQ,This one is a ballbuster but effective.  A little disorganized for a Leslie video but it still works fantastic. Use this one in the evenings,1494374400,,140,4.6
2803401,5,B000OYCMMQ,"Leslie has done it again! This is 4 fast miles that will have you sweating, and feeling great when finished. I used this DVD at least 3 -4 times a week! Awesome weight loss video!",1494201600,,179,4.142857142857143
2803402,5,B000OYCMMQ,This is an excellent workout video ! I really enjoy all of the Sansone d.v.ds. I would highly recommended this video for a great workout  !,1492992000,,139,4.346153846153846
2803403,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This walk is very simple to do.  You don't have to learn steps.  Leslie is very talkative, which could get on one's nerves, however we are given the option of doing the walk with music only.  I also do the walk with my television volume on mute.  The steps are so easy to follow that I can keep up with her easily without sound.  She takes you through intervals of fast walk and jogging.  You will sweat and you will keep in shape without having to learn a complicated workout.  Anyone can do this.  There are onscreen markers to let you know when you have hit a new mile, so you always know how much time you have left.",1492732800,2,620,4.151260504201681
2803404,4,B000OYCMMQ,"I like Leslie Sansone's DVDs because they are great for uncoordinated people like me. Not a lot of dance type moves and she always says it doesn't matter if she goes right and you go left, but it's still really effective, you get a good workout without feeling stupid like some DVDs can do. It is an older one, and it definitely shows, the production quality isn't nearly as good as the newer ones, and for me there's a little too much chatter and different people doing different things. But it wasn't so bad I couldn't get through it and it is a good workout.",1492387200,3,561,4.352380952380952
2803405,5,B000OYCMMQ,"Leslie will make you sweat in this one.  Lots of ""boosted walking"" 3 minute intervals (yes, that's jogging).  Leslie knows how to give a good workout that is easy on the joints and makes you sweat.  I walked on my treadmill for years (and loved it), but I can no longer do that with my toddler running around since it's not safe.  I discovered Leslie and haven't looked back.  I feel that her workouts maximize my time and I actually get more out of these programs than walking on my treadmill.  I can get my walking/workout in with my toddler running around.  I have 3 other DVDs of Leslie's and they are all good, but when I want to push the limit and get the most out of my workout, I choose this one.  I purchased the 2 DVD set and the second DVD has a 15 minute jogging mile, which is also excellent.  If you're going to purchase this, I highly recommend the 2 DVD set..it's worth a few extra dollars.",1490054400,3,906,4.22093023255814
2803406,5,B000OYCMMQ,We love it!,1487980800,,11,3.0
2803407,5,B000OYCMMQ,I loved this one. It definitely got me sweating but went by fast. I'm always glad to see faces I know and this is an older one so I knew most of them. It's like seeing old friends again.,1487116800,,186,3.7948717948717947
2803408,5,B000OYCMMQ,"Love, love, love her tapes!  Needed a 4 mile tape and tried this one...it's from 2006, but the impact is great!  Includes intervals, so this was something different from the other tapes I have of hers!",1487030400,,201,4.555555555555555
2803409,5,B000OYCMMQ,"If you love intervals and 4 mile workouts this one is for you.  She does 5 sets of intervals with ""Boosted"" Walking (Jogging). The intervals are all in the first 3 miles and the final 4th mile is all just fast walking. This is an older one with a group of walkers that include her daughter and niece among them.  You can see the cameras and camera men in parts but after doing this one several times it really didn't bother me so I didn't feel it was a big enough distraction to mark down my review.",1486252800,,499,4.134020618556701
2803459,5,B000OYCMMQ,Love this DVD! It really gets you working your whole body. Sweaty and breathing heavy. Leslie Sansone means business.,1484524800,,117,5.2105263157894735
2803460,4,B000OYCMMQ,"As with all of Leslie's DVDs this is a good workout. I don't care for the production as there are 10-12 people working out in a 10 foot square area so I feel claustrophobic just watching them! Otherwise, can't go wrong with this workout.",1481241600,2,237,4.409090909090909
2803461,5,B000OYCMMQ,So happy to find this.  Replaced a worn out copy.,1475712000,,49,3.9
2803462,5,B000OYCMMQ,"Efficient 4 mile workout that goes fast! Fun but tough with 5 intervals, each 5 minutes in length, with ""boosted"" walking. One of my favorites of hers.",1475107200,,151,4.62962962962963
2803463,5,B000OYCMMQ,"So I tried Leslie's ""10 Day Challenge"", which is to use this DVD workout for 10 days in a row, while eating reasonably, and you're supposed to see measurable results.  Well, I kind of did her challenge, but only for 5 days over the course of 1 week, and I lost 2.8 lbs at the end of the week!  I was floored.  I'm doing WW and my weight losses have really slowed down lately (~ 0.4 lb. losses each week).  Here's what I did:  Starting Sunday, did the other ""Fast & Firm 4 Really Big Miles"" workout, and then did this ""4 Fast Miles"" workout on Monday, Wed., Thursday, and Saturday (I skipped workouts on Tues. and Fri.)  I stayed within my Weight Watchers Daily Target points every day except for Tues. and Fri. (and used up all my extra weekly points by the end of the week).  I also drank tons of water during the week to prevent dehydration.  On Sunday, the scale said I was down 2.8 lbs.  Since it took me 3 months to lose the 7 lbs. I had gained over the winter holidays, I'm thrilled to have this workout & challenge as a quick go-to post-vacation-weight-gain-removal method.",1468195200,,1080,4.306930693069307
2803464,5,B000OYCMMQ,Great workout! Doesn't matter how young or old you are it's great. I have knee and back issues and with a little modifying of a step and I'm good to go!! Been doing her workouts for over a year and have lost 65lbs,1466640000,2,213,3.9767441860465116
2803465,5,B000OYCMMQ,"This is my go-to workout. It's running time is around 48 minutes, and it's Leslie at my favorite - bubbly, genuine, and human, before her spontaneity and sincere talk got stripped away. I have been walking with Leslie for years. I prefer this workout above all the others I've done because it's the perfect level of intensity for me; it's work the time I put into it. I get frustrated by the other DVDs that have run time close to this one (or even longer!) that are fewer miles. I have 3 young kids and a full time job, if I'm going to invest almost an hour a day into a workout, I'd rather get the most bang for my buck. Some people get annoyed with Leslie's chatter, but I love it. When I just started out with this DVD, it helped keep me motivated. Now, my husband and I joke almost the whole time I'm doing this DVD because we can recite it word for word, which I actually like because it helps me know exactly where I am in the workout. I also prefer this because it's the original way that Leslie did her multi-mile workouts, straight through. Some of her newer DVDs that are mix and match bug me because each new mile starts off slowly in almost warm-up mode, and I don't like letting my heart rate fall that much every time a new mile comes.

Many others have given a breakdown of what this workout includes, so I'll just close with saying that the old school Leslie is my favorite and I'll be forever devoted to her. Give me 90s Leslie any day; you can keep your modern Leslie.",1463097600,15,1487,4.235915492957746
2803466,5,B000OYCMMQ,I have several of her DVD's. She is very easy to follow. Some of her DVD's are a little harder than others. I will get more of them. I would recommend these for anyone.,1459296000,,168,3.9705882352941178

2803522,5,B000OYCMMQ,"Awesome workout! 4 very fast miles, the time flies by! Short warm up, 25 minutes of intervals (5 circuits of 3 min fast walking/2 mins boosted walking), then your cooldown walk. 4 miles in 46 mins before your cooldown  starts!",1443916800,,226,4.65
2803523,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I love this workout!  I'm a big fan of Leslie's Walking program.  I own about 20 of her DVD's and do one a day to stay in shape.  I'm 45 years old and have kept to this routine for 5 years after loosing 85 lbs.  I'm now at my perfect weight of 105 lbs and, thanks to Leslie, I've maintained that weight for 5 years!!  Of the 20+ DVD's I own of Leslie Sansone, this is probably my favorite.  I have the 2-DVD set.

DVD 1 is a 4 mile fast walk with intervals of high impact.  The music is a lot of fun, some of my favorite music from all her DVD's, it's really motivating.  Leslie is manic on this one with a lot of joking and fun that keeps your mind off the fact that you're doing a 50 minute workout.  Also, I'm an advanced walker now, I'm in excellent condition.  I can still break a sweat with this DVD when I really work it.  For a beginner, this would be a really rough DVD and I doubt you'd get through it.  She does intervals of high impact in this one which I like and the high impact intervals are 2 minutes which is long enough to give you a good workout.  She doesn't use weights or the stretchy band on this one but they're not needed.  The music is fast and the workout by itself is sufficient.  This is one of Leslie's best DVD's and hardest workouts.

DVD 2 is very good as well.  It's a 15 minute high impact workout, no intervals on this one and, among Leslie's DVD's, it's one of a kind.  You start with a warm up and then go right into a jog and it's all high impact kicking, knee lifts and leg swings til the end.  The first time I did this workout, several years ago, I was a bit worried I wouldn't get through it, but I did.  I was more out of breath than I'd gotten on any of her other DVD's because I wasn't used to staying in high impact aerobics that long.  I can still get a good sweat on this one if I work really hard and I feel it gives me a good boost.  The only complaint I have is the volume of the music varies and it's sometimes very muted.  But I like the workout so much that I just crank up the volume.",1441843200,13,2040,3.919512195121951
2803524,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I used to watch this workout DVD on YouTube, but they no longer have it available so I bought it from Amazon.

Leslie makes it so much fun that it's hard to believe the 4 miles is up! I have two 6 year olds and a 4 year old that do it with me and they also love it. I love that they can do it with me without me having to worry that it is too much for them.",1439424000,2,487,3.6923076923076925

2803723,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I own about 17 or 18 of Leslie's Walk DVDs & this is officially my new favorite 4 mile workout! It was super fast paced, yet simple to follow. I seriously wish I had ordered this sooner.  It's also a very time efficient workout at 50 minutes; most of her other 4 mile walks are an hour long (10 minutes makes a huge difference when you're a working mom).  Very energetic and fun.  The intervals were fantastic, really gets your heart rate up!  And I love love love doing leg swings!  By the end of the workout, I was sweaty, but not exhausted.  I will definitely use this one often!

And for those of you who are skeptical about these walk DVDs; these are not ""sissy"" workouts.  I'm only in my late twenties & I'm in pretty decent shape.  I work out at least 6 times a week, mostly using Leslie's walk DVDs.  I fell in love with Leslie a little over year ago after picking up my first walk DVD at a local target.

2803810,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I am a fan of Leslie - I got my first Walk at Home DVD for free from my dietician when I was first diagnosed with diabetes and told I had to lose 100 lbs. The DVD was specifically aimed at diabetics and was very low impact, assuming this was the introduction to walking, and was a slow two mile walk. I could barely get through half a mile for a long time, but kept at it.. Thanks to that DVD, I changed my life, lost 125 lbs, started walking outside - I now do 5 miles p- or biking 20 miles on a daily basis, 5 to 6 days a week. I graduated to the three mile walk DVD and now that it is winter and I cant get out to do my 20 miles on the bike, I needed something more challenging to get the heart rate up. This is it. There are intervals of Boosted Walking, which is jogging in place, to bring the heart rate up. I have a Rockin Cardio DVD that I use as well and alternate with this. I do the Four Fast Miles in 48 minutes and then pop in the bonus 12 minute DVD for the Advanced  1 Mile Jog and in an hour, I've burned over 500 calories per my heart rate monitor. Not bad. Thanks again, Leslie!  PLUS - you can turn of the talk and walk to music only - makes the time go faster.",1391472000,7,1180,3.7732793522267207
2803811,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This DVD is OK to get in a little exercise on a day when I can't get outside. Following her steps, I can get my heart rate up but need to do the jog steps more than the walking to feel like I am getting enough cardio. This is a good dvd for beginners or for someone just starting to get into an exercise program.",1390348800,,312,3.8153846153846156
2803812,4,B000OYCMMQ,"I have done several Leslie workouts in my attempt to get back into regular exercise and so far I feel pretty dang good. When I got up this AM I started to do another workout (by a trainer who whips big people into shape on TV.....) but my 26-year-old knees started popping from the jumping around. I thought I might welcome the change from the Leslie DVD's I have been doing lately but I realized it's just not worth killing my joints and, in all honesty, I have yet to grow tired of Leslie's workouts. Plus I have not once thought ""Man this is too hard...I should just quit"" when I use one of her workouts.

After my knee popping with a different DVD I used this workout for the first time. It was a welcome change from her ""just walking"" walks! I HATE jogging or running but I didn't hate it while doing this workout. One thing that does get me is keeping up the jogging pace while doing the kicks and such. It takes me a round or two to get into my rhythm but I eventually get there. The jogging (or as she calls it ""boosted walking"") bursts are just the right length of time for me to keep with them without seriously contemplating stopping.

I would consider this intermediate to advanced of her workouts and if you are first starting out don't expect to be able to follow her along just how she does it. I suggest starting out with her shorter walks that are a little longer/easier. There are a lot of her walks on YouTube and that's how I am figuring out which DVD's I want to buy before I spend the money. Try some out!

My main complaint with ALL of her DVD's is the stretching at the end. Her stretching does not seem adequate and I have mentioned it on all of my reviews of her workouts. I don't even follow her along with the stretching anymore and just do my own thing.

I really enjoyed this DVD and think a lot of people will. Of course you can't please everybody so, as I said, it may be good to go view her workouts and pick out some good ones to buy.",1390089600,,1968,4.171052631578948

2803867,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I have over 30 Leslie Sansone DVDs and this is one of my 2 favorites from her.  No negatives about this workout.  I always have a good time doing this workout and I always end up in a good mood at the end.  This is also one that allows me to work out the entire time in my heart rate zone (I wear a heart rate monitor).

This one has a mix of popular music as well as good techno music for the intervals.  Nothing annoying.

This workout is one continuous workout, it is not broken up into segments with different groups of people.  Everyone is with her from beginning to end and it shows.  LOL  They have a very good time in this workout and it is infectious.  It is a way of doing a group class without having to actually go to the gym.

The 4 Fast Miles is challenging, but it's not for beginners, it's for intermediate and advanced people. It's 50 minutes and there are five 90 second jogging segments with a 2 minutes water break after the 3rd segment. She has 2 people doing the ""low impact"" version if you don't want to job or only want to jog for a couple of segments.  She is getting more and more into interval training with jogging segments on her DVDs.

For the jogging stuff, if you have jiggle anywhere, I find that it really helps to batten down the hatches firmly. It's uncomfortable for me to be jumping around with everything jiggling.

I love her stuff and glad she is getting back to basics and stopping all those gadgets and just doing good, solid, high intensity, low impact aerobics again.",1383350400,4,1512,4.278169014084507

2803875,4,B000OYCMMQ,"**Pros**

1) This involves HIGH energy and it really reminds me of other DVD '4 Mile Power Walk'. The two are similar but I think her other DVD will really make you sweat. You will really feel your heart pounding in your chest. Just make sure to drink some water at least 30 minutes BEFORE. That's what she said! Ladies you also need to wear a good sports bra. There is a lot of bouncing in this.

2) I love that she's with other people. It keeps me distracted but also gives me more to focus on, especially in a big dark gym. She does pick on Jimmy a lot (the guy in the back). Her beautiful daughter and Niece are there as well. She'll go around and introduce you to them.

3) The DVD gives you a very playful atmosphere. Leslie does laugh a lot and shares some family stories. I wish people would be a little more easy on her about her perky personality and the fact that she talks too much. It's NOT really that bad! I'd much rather have a very encouraging motivator then one that has no personality and is very monotone.

**Neutral**
I don't have any cons for this DVD. So here it goes...

1) The music is not a good variety. By the time you get to the second mile, she'll have you do boosts. The boost music stays the same and the normal in-between-intervals (whatever you call it) has the same music. And I think it stays that way until the 4th mile. So, it's not a lot for your ears to hear. But the music is nice and loud.

2) Her and the people around her are very huddled together. With all the tons of space they had in that gym, I wonder why they were so tightly grouped. It could be that maybe something was wrong with one of their cameras or other settings.

3) The production was kind of sloppy becuase you could see the cameramen plenty of times along with the cameras moving. It kind of makes you think that maybe this was just something they decided to slap together after waking up one morning with the idea.

4) Her key in executing or exchanging moves is about 4.5/5. She'll make you miss your step sometimes, but I've never had a problem in just quickly adjusting.

5) The timer at the bottom does not stay solid. It will go in and out through all miles.

*********
Despite the little bugs, I'm very impressed with what it can make me do. With the heart monitor watch I burned around 460 calories by doing the entire 4 miles at once. She's helped me lose 15 pounds so far. So, I'm loving her! If you're around 160-159- pounds you should be able to do this. Again, it's a lot of bouncing and very quick pace.",1372982400,,2530,4.208677685950414
2803928,5,B000OYCMMQ,this tape is good you can get 4 miles done in 50 minutes.  I own several dvds  I like to interchange them on a daily basis,1371081600,,122,3.6538461538461537
2803929,5,B000OYCMMQ,This is one of my favorites! It's nice to have it among my selections of her DVDs just to change among them every day. The content is much like her others which is fine for me as I get a good workout by adding intensity to each DVD.,1371081600,,232,3.8541666666666665
2803930,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This DVD delivers as promised!  The introduction says to do the dvd 10 days in a row and you will see results.  I started this DVD on Saturday and by day number four I could see visible results in my waistline and arms.  I can now button my blouse and arms fit sleeves that were once too tight.  In addition, I have amazing energy, stamina and increased endurance, all this in only four days.  I am soooo excited and motivated that I can't wait to get to day number ten!!

When I did this DVD the first time I did not like it for many of the same reasons as some of the other reviewers, i.e., disorganized movements, not crazy about the music, silly James Brown puppet, etc. etc.  I am so glad I got over the petty-ness and decided to look at this DVD for what it was intended which is a fitness video not an entertainment video.  By the third day of doing the DVD I found myself actually liking the music and even singing along while I was working out.  Leslie is very chatty but for me it is a wonderful distraction from the intensity of the workout and her pep talks helps me to get through the workout with less stress.  Now I actually like the James Brown puppet and I do the scream along with the joggers just to make it more fun and helps the time go by faster with the all added distractions.

This is an advanced DVD, so if you are just getting started, I would suggest you build your way up by doing her 1,2 and 3 mile videos for a couple of weeks before moving to the advanced video, otherwise you will get discouraged. I always fall back on the older Walk-away-the-Pounds videos 1,2,3 miles that are fantastic workouts because because those exercises include hand weights so you get some muscle building along with the walk.

I have an extensive exercise video collection (over 100) with various artists to add variety to my workouts but Leslie is ""go-to girl"" every time.  She always offers simple, no-nonsense workouts that do the job every time.  If fitness in a fun way is your goal, Leslie is by far the best!",1369785600,5,2026,4.325396825396825

LOL A fast, fun workout, but be forewarned, it does have ""boosted"" walking aka jogging so if you have trouble with your joints, knees, ankles, shins, be prepared to do alternate low impact moves. Another bonus, this video does have someone demonstrating that...wish the newer ones had done the same.",1362614400,,490,4.455555555555556
2803991,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I discovered Leslie Sansone by chance, whilst perusing fitness dvd reviews, as she's not so readily available or well known here in England - at least, she wasn't to myself!  Having been exercising regularly for just a few months and greatly enjoying my 'Davina' workouts, I was a little sceptical about low impact/walking as a means of increasing fitness/losing weight and I had to ferret around for regions 0/2 in order to actually play them!

Anyway, I now have three of Leslie's dvds and am thoroughly enjoying them.  I was able to dive right in at a 5 mile one with no problem and then got two 4 mile dvds including this one.  I have learned to adapt them and ramp the workouts up somewhat with the use of handweights/more arm movements etc and my hrm confirms that I'm getting a really good 'Burn' from them - not that I really needed the hrm to know that!

I like Leslie and her 'Walkers' very much.  She is such a cheerful, encouraging person and her constant chatter actually helps me to keep going!  I don't dread putting her on, fearing the onslaught of 'Stars and Spotties' to come, as I do find them a little jarring on my slightly aging knees!  On further investigation, I have also discovered Erin O'Brian, who offers a low impact strength/cardio training regime which I use in conjunction with Leslie and like her a lot, too.  I need variety in my workouts to make them both enjoyable and sustainable.

To sum up, I would heartily recommend these 'Walks' and urge anyone hesitating at the idea that they don't constitute much of a workout to try them.  They can be as gentle or as energetic as you choose to make them, believe me, and can reduce you to a breathless, sweating heap - if that's what you want - and at far less cost to your knees!",1362009600,2,1760,4.46875

She was alone on the floor, still chatty but not as bad as on the two dvds I've purchased and tried so far, and it felt more like having a personal trainer.....more lets get down to business rather than a giggly time with the girlfriends.....maybe I'm just not a 'group' kind of person.
I also don't like how the dvds are like a menu of walks to choose from, they seem inconsistent and it doesn't flow nicely....the chatting and giggling are distracting from focusing on the workout.  It also looks (and feels) like they were put together from already existing workouts more as a way to make money than to offer something new to the customer.....I was disappointed.
I will however still thank Leslie for that fabulous 3 mile walk which has helped me loose close to 30lbs since June 2012!  Do more like that Leslie.....serious one on one training.",1347494400,4,989,4.5195530726256985

I purchased some others of her walks, but this one is the best. It is a brisk and quick. I just set aside 45 minutes to walk out and I don't care about the 1 mile completed 2 mile completed etc. so if you don't have 45 minutes don't get this one. I am 62 and do this workout every day.

Warm up and cool down, which is sometimes less than adequate on her other DVDs, are good.  Cool down might last too long; after the last interval there is a 10 minute 'fast walk' which isn't fast enough after the intervals, its not really cool down, but it feels like cool down before the real cool down.

She often jumps from one move to another with practically no warning, which is not her usual style.

Another con is that there is very little upper body workout in this dvd.  Because of an old ankle injury I wasn't able to do the jogging ""moves"" but it felt great to just jog in place.",1302912000,2,733,4.432835820895522

When you are feeling extra energetic or need to burn some calories after that chocolate dessert, this is the video. The 4 miles goes really fast with 5 boosted-walking intervals and some dance steps for good variety. As always, Leslie introduces the exercise with the four basic steps: walking, knee lifts, kicks, and side steps.

The James Brown doll at the end of the video is goofy, but doesn't detract from the video's effectiveness. There is also a nice cooldown of stretching at the end. I must say that the song played during the intervals, ""Everybody,"" gets a little repetitious, but like Leslie says, it has the perfect beat for the boosted walking (light jogging).

2804227,4,B000OYCMMQ,"I own many of Leslie's DVDs because of their simplicity. Her workouts are all based around walking in your own home so anyone at any age can do them, you don't need a lot of space to do them in, and you can do them even if there's inclement weather. I personally do not like to exercise in a place where anyone can see me because I am overweight and I feel like people are thinking, ""she needs to exercise a little more."" So her DVDs are the perfect solution for me.

The first time I used this DVD, I was on a very strict diet and I was using it everyday. I saw results immediately. On the back of the DVD cover, it states that after only 10 walks, it will have you looking and feeling slimmer. I put that theory to the test then and it worked!

Now I am on Weight Watchers and I am starting this DVD back up again and also will test the theory once again.

I enjoy this DVD because it gives me the option to challenge myself by ""boosting"" the walk which is really jogging, or to stay low impact by just walking at a fast pace. In this workout, she leads you through interval training which in this case is 3 minutes of fast paced walking then 2 minuets of jogging. You do 5 sets of those.

The production is not the best, the participants look like they need more room, she talks a lot as usual, and you never know if the participants are sweating because of the really bright lights or the workout itself. Those are the only cons I can think of.

Overall, I like this one because it is something different, but it's still basic movements, and I still work up a good sweat.

Of the three I like the Fast and Firm 4 Miles the best. Both of the Walk Slim tapes are preferable because they include boosted walking or Leslie Sansone's term for jogging. This DVD includes five sets of intervals. It's energetic, lively and fast paced and the individuals exercising to it on the tape seem to be having a really good time.

As a few rather observant previous reviewers indicated, this tape had some problems with its filming however. I agree with Katch that this ""did not feel like it was Leslie's best work"".  Everybody DID look squished together and you wondered whether the cameramen knew anything about using a wide angle lense properly!  I also believe that the way it was filmed made some of the exercisers appear heavier than they really are.  Also even though a number of them were sweating heavily. you weren't sure if it was because they were working that strenuosly or because of the hot Hollywood lights bearing down on them.

Additionally I have now been exercising to a number of Leslie's tapes. I have mixed feelings about a tape not including strength training. It DOES feel good to do a lot of boosted walking and no doubt you are burning a lot of calories doing so. It just feels like something is missing. You wonder if you are getting a total workout.

Additionally it's just a better production--they more clearly let you know just how much distance you have covered i.e. 1 mile, 1 1/2 miles, 2 miles etc. The set is more cheerful.

Since I do lower impact, I am sure to watch other participants to make sure upper body exercises are implimented to use core muscles to tone down waist line.  You are getting a good work out if you do the lower impact. My blood pressure, cholesterol, & heart function are good. I have been using Leslie Sansone's DVDs for years & I believe that this is very safe if you use common sense when doing these exercises, & do not push yourself especially if just starting out.",1273190400,5,911,4.431137724550898
2804269,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I have a zillion of Leslie's videos. I'm at the point where I am walking 5 miles a day. Luckily this DVD came with a bonus 1-mile jog DVD as well. I did that one first and then got right into the 4 fast miles. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! It had these awesome intervals of gentle jogs and went by so fast. The vibe was happy and fun. The studio was nothing special but who cares? The content of this DVD is fantastic.

2804271,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This DVD is indeed 4 fast miles--48 minutes altogether.  I like the pace of it and the ""boosted walking"" (jogging) segments.  On a busy work day I can do two miles in about 25 minutes (including a stretch afterward) and feel like I got in a decent walk.

As many others have mentioned, the people walking with her look like they're crammed together in one little section of a big studio, but I got used to that after a couple of times.  I LOVE the music only option as Leslie's incessant chattering gets on my nerves after I've seen one of her DVDs once or twice.

Leslie's videos have never had the high production values like The Firm or other exercise videos, but they are priced accordingly. The first Leslie tape I got years ago was actually filmed in her living room--you could see her (now grown) children playing in the backyard through the windows!

All in all, I'm rating this on content and what I get out of it.  I'll continue to buy Leslie's DVDs as the lack of complexity suits me; when I'm exercising at 5:00 AM I'm not awake enough to follow complicated or dancy workouts.",1262822400,2,1088,4.437185929648241

I like the intervals in the middle.  I feel like I have done something by the time I finish.  I would recommend this workout.  I am not really advanced, but I am not new to exercising so I wanted something that would be a little difficult. This was perfect.",1257465600,2,434,3.9310344827586206

However....Everyone in this video was on top of each other.  I mean the set looked big enough but everyone was so bunched up Im sure they had to force smiles.

Also...As a professional I could not believe the James Brown doll she brings out toward the end...I mean really.

Cueing seemed a bit off and she talks ""A Lot"" in this one but did not take away that this was indeed 4 fast miles.  Included is a boosted walking 1 mile dvd (pretty much jogging the whole thing) which makes this worth while since it is for an advanced excerciser.  I usually put that in once she gets to the James Brown bit to keep my momentum going.

So far I have 5 Leslie Sansone videos and find that ""Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk"" is her best of all of them.",1256860800,4,890,4.133720930232558

If you are looking for a challenge, but you just plain ol' walking bores you, this is perfect.  If you have back problems or knee problems, it is very easy on everything.

This DVD has solved my problems! I follow Mikki (the pretty strawbery blonde behind Leslie) because she works out at a higher level. I wish Leslie would always have someone working at a higher level for us veteran fitness buffs.

The workout itself is 4 miles, but what I do is mile 1-2-3, then rewind and do 2-3-and most of 4 -- or until the James Brown bit starts. It gives me a good hour plus workout.

I feel that this is a great DVD for beginners and veterans alike -- you can follow the exercisers doing the low level, then progress to Leslie and eventually Mikki.",1248998400,3,790,4.184210526315789
2804316,4,B000OYCMMQ,"I have been using Leslie's workouts for a long while, and she really does provide a good workout. This DVD has some really good things going for it, in my opinion:

-25 minute interval session - this can make you sweat with several 2 minute boosted sessions (jogging, leg swings, hopping knee lifts etc.). I really feel like I did my work with this bit.

-the Music ONLY feature is great. I love Leslie, but she talks a LOT in this one and I find I can concentrate better with just the music.

However, it also has some things going against it:

- Leslie gets very sloppy during the cool down minutes, and is quite distracted talking to every member of the walk team. The workout suffers here (during the music only I make up my own steps so there is variety)

- As other have said, people are squashed together in the video and they are not coordinated. Find one person and follow him/her. The walker behind Leslie is very visible, and she keeps a very high pace and uses big arm movements (often that Leslie isn't using at all). But, if you want a really intense workout, follow her. I follow Leslie, generally, but even she gets off here and there.

- The stretch is not nearly as good as the 4 Big Miles DVD. This one is sort of short, and doesn't really stretch out the legs. I miss the yoga moves on the other DVD.

- Leslie really needs some new music. There are lots of wonderful songs and mixes out there that would provide the proper beat for working out. After doing WATP for so long I am really REALLY sick of this music.

However, the downsides really don't make it a poor workout, especially for those of us familiar enough with Leslie to just make our way through. You SHOULD sweat with this one if you give it your all.. I do!",1246492800,5,1742,4.289634146341464

Walk, sidestep, kick, jog. That's basically it. The fact that they put a ""Music Only"" setting on the video tells you something about how much Leslie feels the need to talk and joke with her kids (CONSTANTLY).

It's an okay video for beginners because the steps are easy to learn. But if you are more advanced and want something high impact then look elsewhere.",1243296000,9,544,4.271844660194175

When we ordered the video from you and I played it, I was so disappointed to see that there was an entirely different group of people.

The cues were off more than normal and she kept talking to Jimmy in the back.  Seeing the camera guys was a bit distracting as well.  I do enjoy her workouts and have been using them for the last couple of years, but felt that this was not her best one.  It felt really thrown together and the dark background was dreary.  At times the shots were fuzzy and when she was demonstrating steps the cameras were aimed elsewhere or the shots would shake.

The stretching was also disorganized.  Leslie also seemed to be going a little over the top with her commentary.  I usually really enjoy her great attitude and positive encouragement, that is why I bought this workout.  But this time it was too much.  I know we are supposed to be having fun, but it seemed they were having too much of a good time. When the James Brown doll was introduced towards the end of the walk and they started dancing with it, I just wanted the workout to be over with.  Not because I was exhausted, but I was just tired of the distractions.

I'm in decent shape, but have some weight to lose, and the 4 miles makes me feel like I really have ""worked out"" by the end (the 1 and 2 mile videos just feel like a stroll around the back yard).  The ""boosted walking"" (jogging) intervals are great - really brings up the heart rate.
The 50 minute length is kind of long - makes it hard to squeeze a walk in during my son's naptime.  But I love the music and the laid-back attitude.  The steps are so easy, anyone can do it (except I do have trouble with the jogging leg swings).  It's great for wintertime when I can't go for walks around the neighborhood with my 1-year-old son.  I also love the ""real"" figures all the walkers have - no stick-insect women with hard bodies and perfect makeup..... They all look like normal gals, and they sweat!

This product would be great if Leslie would stop talking so much and stop acting silly and do some cuing.  A lot of the moves are started with no advance warning. Listening to Leslie talk is okay after one or two viewings but it gets very annoying by the third time around. I like that her steps are easy to follow and there is no complicated choreography but I am putting in the tape to exercise not to learn the participants in the videos life story. It seems to me that with each new video she is even more talkative than the last.  It is very frustrating and because of this fact this may be last video of hers that I purchase.

Also I have noted that even though these titles are ""so called"" fast walks they do not seem to take any less time than the normal walk series videos.",1224892800,,854,4.126506024096385
2804354,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I'm new to the whole walk at home concept and I first tried this DVD out by renting it -- I have to say I was hooked and just HAD to own it. :)  I've been doing bellydancing and bellydance/aerobic mix videos for years and I'd say I'm an intermediate exerciser.  This is a fun workout, the steps are very easy to learn.  It's not difficult at all, there was never any time that I was breathing hard.  Just when I started thinking it might be too easy I realized how much I was sweating and my heart rate was definitely up in what my doctor says is the ideal range for me to exercise at.

At first I thought Leslie was a bit too chatty but the more I did the workout the more I came to like her.  She seems genuinely friendly and I love the way she encourages without going into drill sergeant ""FEEL THE BURNNNNN!"" mode.  Now I just find myself listening to her chatter on and let her while away the minutes for me.

The only downside of this DVD is the way that it was produced.  I didn't mind that the studio was a bit dark as you can still see what Leslie is doing, however the camera angles are odd at times, when they go into doing grapevines the camera is over here, over there, and then they go to only shooting people from mid-thigh up.  At first I had trouble following until I figured out the footwork.  There are several times when the camera is showing her from the waist up when it would really be more helpful to show her entire body.  Also, for those who want to do the entire routine as low-impact there are times when you can't see either one of the low-impact people who you are supposed to be following.  The fact that everybody was so close together in that big space didn't bother me much, nor did it bother me that there are a few bloopers in the video, it seems to have all been done on one take (I don't know if her other videos are like that).  The bloopers made me feel like I was in a real class where everybody doesn't do everything perfect all of the time and I feel that as a beginner ""walk at home"" person it made me feel that it ok if I wasn't doing everything perfectly right away.

Yes, Leslie is chatty and sometimes silly in this DVD, but I believe this is what makes her so real and fun!  Yes, the cameras show a few times during filming of this DVD and the James Brown doll was a little on the silly side, but the workout is GREAT!  I bought this DVD for the workout and, believe me, I get a good one using this DVD!  I am 52 years old and 50 pounds overweight (after losing 38 pounds recently doing walk aerobics).

It's only about 15 minutes long but I just pop it in twice for a quick cardio before I do some weight training. I have read complaints from people that don't like Leslie's workouts because they don't think they are intense enough. I have an easy solution for this: you need to add resistance. I use 2.5 lb (total 5 lbs) ankle weights, a 15 lb weight vest, and 2 lb (total 4 lbs) hand weights. My heart rate ranges from 145-160 which is exactly where I want it to be. If you want something a little more intense, I would also recommend Walk Your Way Slim with Michelle Dozios (you will probably not need to add any resistance to this workout because it's very intense), Walk/Sculpt/ and tone with Debbie Rocker (fairly intense but over 60 minutes) and Walk Yourself Fit with Chris Freytag. I have all of these and like them all for different reasons, but to get a good workout I add some form of resistance to all of them.",1206144000,5,1038,4.221105527638191

2804400,2,B000OYCMMQ,"I've heard so many good things about Leslie Sansone's ""walking"" tapes so I finally decided to give this a try since I haven't been able to get outside due to the never-ending Ohio winter.

Let me start by saying that I regularly walk outside 4 miles per day and it takes me approximately 54 minutes.  I wear a Polar heart monitor and on those walks, I average about 380 calories burned and stay within my target heart rate zone more than 50% of the time.  During Leslie's supposed 4 mile ""walk"", I burned 268 calories and only spent 16% of the walk in my target heart rate zone.  So I felt like for the time invested in this workout, the return was just not there.  (In the DVD, Leslie and some of the other women are dripping with sweat -- the only thing I can figure is their studio must have been very warm because I'm a HUGE sweat-er and I was barely breaking a trickle.)

I know Leslie is hugely popular and my intent is not to offend anyone who loves doing her tapes. Having said that, I found this to be a real snoozer.  First of all, she's not walking at all (duh!) but rather marching in place.  Marching and walking are NOT the same; they do not use the same muscles at all -- walking requires one to stretch out the leg fully and really use those glute muscles and marching just doesn't give the same effect.  The steps are repetitive and boring, just march, march, march with an occasional side step or leg kick.  **yawn**... For anyone who is used to doing any kind of cardio workout tapes, I think you will find this incredibly boring.

While Leslie has an upbeat personality and a lot of energy, she nearly drove me crazy because she NEVER stops yakking!  And much of the banter is just downright silly chatter. A lot of giggling, UN-funny jokes and hamming it up with her co-dancers.  (True, there is an option to turn off her voice-over but personally I like to hear someone cueing me.)  I can't see ANY man exercising to this DVD -- she's so loud and drones on and on that it would be like listening to your wife nag you for 50 minutes!

A much better alternative with a MUCH better calorie burn (and WAY more fun!) are the Prevention Fitness System dance tapes with Marie Forleo and Jennifer Galardi, and also Crunch Cardio Dance Blast featuring Marie Forleo.  All are available right here on Amazon.  While the footwork is a bit tricky at first, after repeating the tapes a few days in a row you will be a pro.  And it is just so darn fun to do those Latin moves, hip-hop, and funky jazz.  Also, Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo and Chalene Johnson's Turbo Jam would be much better cardio options.

Sorry Leslie... this DVD will be going right into the ""donate"" pile :(",1204761600,17,2677,4.358870967741935

It isn't going to give me an excuse to whimp out. The first few times I did this workout I was really breathing hard during the 2 minute jogging segments. But, I knew it would boost my fitness level if I kept at it. I do Leslie's other workouts 5 or 6 days a week. I just replaced two of those days with this workout and after a month I really feel my aerobic conditioning improving. It's getting easier for me to handle the jogging segments. I'm 50 years old and have never jogged my whole life. This DVD is inspiring me to try running outside this spring.

Living in Australia we are not so lucking as to have the choice of Leslie's workouts as other countries.  I have been doing what workouts of Leslies's that were released here on and off for 25 years and now because of the internet a whole new world has been opened for me.  This workout, and the other Walk Slim programs are just what you need if, like me, you need to work alittle bit harder.  As with all Leslie's workouts the moves are easy to follow, and I love that she makes mistakes, and they really get you sweating.  You can do her walks whatever the weather and do not have to rely on other people for outside walk times. So in short, if you need to do some sort of cardio, and find gym areobics too much, and like the convenince of working out at home this will do the trick.  All the Walk Slim's will do this for you and they are all slightly differant.  Give them a try.",1200182400,,1080,4.906593406593407
2804449,5,B000OYCMMQ,"this is an awesome dvd. i titled this instant gratification because i am 27 years old and completly out of shape. in my teens and early twenties i helped train people in the gym and i was extremely in shape, 5ft4 130lbs. now i am 200 pounds and hardly move. i have tried though. i have a treadmill, the boflex, freeweights and tons of home videos, and the gazelle. nothing has motivated me more to work out than this set of dvds.

as i started to say earlier, i call this review instant gratification, because when i do treadmill by myself i have no motivation. i walk for like 30 minutes at 2.0 because that is all i think i can handle, and i only do about half a mile which depresses me.

with these dvds, i am walking 1-4 miles a day!! i know i just started wednsday of this week, but i have already put in 9 miles in about 4 days!! for me, that is worth almost more than losing all the pounds. now, i'm not sure how accurate the 4 mile walks are, but i know that there are a lot of intervals in them which does make you walk miles faster.

i sit in front of a computer at work, i sit in front of a computer at home, and sometimes go out with friends. this is so easy all i have to do is pop the dvd in my dvd drive and get up, and before i know it i've put in 4, sometimes 5 miles!! the other day i was bored and decided to walk, popped it in, did the 3 mile easy walks and decided i wanted to do more and did one of the other 4 mile dvds!!

this is the fitness level i am at now and it is wonderful. it will be my core workout until i can do the treadmill or the firm dvds. i am so thankful for these dvds! if you are a couch or computer potato, please consider these. they are so easy to incorperate into your lifestyle, you won't believe it! i keep these at my computer desk and i have already done them several times this week. i even break a sweat! i love them. definitly try them!",1200182400,4,1890,3.9012987012987015
2804450,5,B000OYCMMQ,"*There are two dvds in this workout:
>>There is ""1 Mile Jog."" It involves moving at a much faster pace with your feet off the ground (e.g. a familiar side step becomes a leg-swinging pendulum, a knee-up now incorporates a hop).

>>Then there is an intermediate workout which has five complete slower-then-faster cycles.

Review for the cycle workout:
*Leslie provides an introduction as to how to best use the dvd in relation to your fitness level.

*The dvd is divided into chapters which are listed on a menu at the beginning of the dvd, so that you can immediately go to a particular chapter.  The chapters are Mile 1, Mile 2, Mile 3 and Mile 4.

*Leslie adds a few new moves (if you are familiar with her other work-outs) - grapevines, leg swings and some side lunges..not too dancey, but a nice change and easily modified for those who need it.

*The moves are easy to follow and don't take much thought.

*There is a countdown clock on the screen so you know how much time you have left.

*It has segments of boosted walking (jogging) that really get your heart rate up.

*Leslie has a few of her exercisers demonstrate a low impact version of the moves so you can choose to do the high or low impact.

*This is an intense work-out that will definitely get you sweating.

*There is an option of a music only workout if you don't enjoy her chatting.

*At the end of the dvd, she introduces her other exercisers, including her daughter.  It was sweet.

*Most of all I saw a definite change in my body, just as she promised.

Cons:
There are a few quirky things.  She spends a little time talking to a James Brown doll.  She forgets what she is doing in one place and at times she seems a little disorganized.  You can also see the camera occasionally.  But if you get into the exercise, these are minor distractions, in my opinion.

I highly recommend this dvd.",1198108800,15,1865,4.445427728613569
2804451,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I've been doing this DVD for a week and a half and can already feel and see a difference in my legs and butt!  I would consider myself in decent shape and enjoy walking- so I jumped strait to the 4 fast miles and have enjoyed it.  You have the option of a ""music only workout"" which cuts out the commentary from Leslie. After I watched the workout 2-3 times, I didn't really want to hear the same jokes night after night.

Overall a great workout!",1197504000,7,447,4.174418604651163
2804452,5,B000OYCMMQ,"This DVD will work you out! This is not my favorite Leslie Sansone work out, but it is a good addition to any collection. I use this when I am having a bad day and really need to get some frustration out. I like the casual attitude in this DVD, Leslie Sansone's encouragement to keep going, and I like that everyone on the DVD is sweating, like real people.",1195948800,,357,4.188405797101449
2804453,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I love this workout! I have tried some of Leslie's other workouts, but they don't compare to this one.  In this workout she does interval training which is a few minutes of fast walking and than a couple minutes of boosted walking (jogging).  It's a GREAT workout for the heart and every muscle in the body.  I FINALLY walk away feeling like I got a good workout-yet i'm not exhausted or frustrated about learning steps (there aren't any!).  I'm extremely happy with my new daily workout and the results! I feel and look GREAT!",1194825600,5,527,4.574468085106383
2804454,5,B000OYCMMQ,I have been doing Leslie's tapes for years.  I lost 85lbs with the help of her tapes and now run about 5 miles a day.  I found this workout to be good alternative to running.  I still felt that I got a great workout.  I use it when I am not able to get my run in due to weather.  I felt it is one of the workouts that seems to go the fastest- before I know it is at the cool down.,1193702400,6,380,3.5301204819277108
2804455,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I've done a lot of Leslie Sansone workouts, but this is my favorite.  For one, it actually makes me sweat.  Second, it does get 4 miles done in under an hour.  Lastly, I've been doing it for three weeks now and still laugh at the little jokes and comraderie.  That's probably the most amazing part of all!",1193443200,,305,4.298245614035087
2804456,5,B000OYCMMQ,"Since I can now do all the WOTP Express tapes with wrist weights and still not sweat, this is a welcome change.  The time goes fast, the music - though repetitive - cues me when I'm also watching TV, the moves are doable and I like that she shows all levels of activity.  And I'm really sweating when it's over.  The three miler in this series is also good, the intervals just aren't as obvious.",1192579200,,395,4.24
2804477,5,B000OYCMMQ,I love Leslie so it wasn't a surprise that I loved this new workout! Fast 4 Miles will give you a challenging workout if you choose. You are able to do high impact intervals or stay low impact. The time goes by quickly and I really enjoy it. I have seen results from this dvd and I use it 5 days a week.,1190764800,6,303,3.8253968253968256
2804478,5,B000OYCMMQ,"I enjoy all of her workouts that I've bought so far.  This one is great, really gets me sweaty.  Just when I think I can't possibly do another set, we're done.  I could do without the ""James Brown"" moment but have learned to just roll my eyes and continue working out.  Excellent, excellent, excellent!  If you're new to exercising you should really give one of Leslie's shorter videos a whirl-it's so easy and I love that you can build on them.  I lost 20lbs the first year I used her 2 and 3 mile videos without any diet changes.",1188950400,9,531,4.313131313131313
2804479,5,B000OYCMMQ,This is an excellent way for me to get my walking in when the weather is either too wet too hot or too cold to venture out in.  It is a welcomed addition to my exercise regimen.,1187740800,,177,3.7837837837837838
2804480,5,B000OYCMMQ,"With this workout you get classic Leslie, lot's of positive energy and all her normal enthusiasm.  She has 3 family members on this workout and a couple folks from her class.  This uses 5 segments of interval bursts.  Which is jogging for 2 minutes after you speed walk for 3 minutes before each 2 minute burst.  You get a great workout in 50 minutes and will actually see real results from doing interval training.  Recent studies show that interval training helps boost your metabolism even after you're done with the workout.  This is the type of workout that helps you do just that.  It does have some kooky Leslie moments but you don't even care once you realize you're getting a really great workout with this.  There are 2 members that do a low impact version of the 2 minute intervals but they aren't shown through out the workout, however if you have done Leslie workouts before you won't have any problem following along until you can do the higher impact versions.  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get great results from a interval type workout.",1187654400,9,1069,4.6436170212765955
2804481,4,B000OYCMMQ,"I have been walking to Leslie's DVD's for quite some time now.  The 5 mile one is a great workout and leaves room for a lot of my unique variation to eleviate boredom with same routine everytime.  This one the 4 mile I thought would be pretty equivalent however, this one is harder than the 5 mile because it has several minutes of Jogging and Jogging Kicks, and double knee lifts (tummy crunch).  I do this one when I need to get a heavy workout in a shorter amount of time.  Still my video of chose is the 5 mile one.  This is definately for those of you who are ready to challenge yourself and get a little bored with the 5 mile.  This is also hard to do with tenneshoes on the carpet, as the jogging kicks etc and sidekicks you need to have the fluidity and carpet with shoes provides too much resistance and makes it hard to complete the exercise correctly.  I do it with socks on only since I do not have a smoother surface.  Be prepared to sweat a lot keep a hand towel & your water handy.",1186876800,8,996,4.124352331606218
2804482,3,B000OYCMMQ,"I think that the newer Leslie's walks the less I enjoy. It was a great workout, but I really like her older videos better. This video should have been called walk & jog. There were  walk/jog intervals, but there was always someone that kept the workout low impact for those who wanted it. Overall, ok, but not the best.",1186617600,2,319,4.406779661016949
2804483,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This Dvd is a good workout, don't get me wrong about that.
I just found her chatting a bit more distracting this time (but you can turn the voice off, so that is good). And, I also did not care for the music selection. I guess I am not an oldies type person.
The people in the video seem to be cramped, and too close together, like they are going to run into eachother.
I just liked her other arrangements better and her other set better.
The workout itself is what I gave the four stars to.",1185840000,2,491,4.072164948453608
2804484,4,B000OYCMMQ,"This is a great exercise video. I feel I get a great in home workout in 50 minutes. I've been happy with most of her walk at home products, but this one will make you sweat! I do want to warn customers that even though the ad and packaging indicate there is a bonus 1 mile jog DVD, it was not included.",1184803200,6,302,3.8870967741935485
2804485,3,B000OYCMMQ,"I have a lot of Leslie's videos and I've always loved every one- until I got this one.  It definitely gets my heart pumping and blood flowing, but I don't feel that I'm getting a total workout.  Her other videos incorporate hand weights and work the arms along the way as well.  Try one of her older videos and I think you'll be happier.",1184025600,2,337,4.234375
2804486,5,B000OYCMMQ,"This would definately be one of Leslies best workout dvds.  I really enjoy doing it and it's totally fun yet fat burning.

There are two workouts on two DVD's.  The Four Fast Miles is challenging and non-stop cardio using different speeds of walking.  With that is a high impact and a low impact so almost anyone can do this.  If you can't manage the high impact, there is a low impact variation to try instead.  It's also fun to dance to music that you are familiar with and can sing to to make the exercise session go faster.  On the second dvd, you actually do some jogging which obviously is a higher impact and more challenging if you aren't at least somewhat fit.

She is so encouraging and enjoyable to listen to and watch.  The moves are never intimidating and this is such a good workout to do, especially when the weather doesn't 'allow' you to be outside.  I love this.",1181606400,13,880,4.409937888198757

I have never written a review on her videos, because all in all I like them even with her incessant chatter on the videos. However, this has to be the worst DVD she ever put out. She is crazy giddy during the whole video like she took something. The ""new"" studio she keeps to referring to must have some intense lighting as she is full of sweat into the first part of the video, and the others start to sweat later. YUCK! Not pretty Leslie. The group is so snug together, they can barely move without bumping into one another. I guess they didn't have a wide angle lens? The music was a combination of works she used in other videos, which was a cheap way to make this video. And, then comes the big finale with a song themed by James Brown. She takes out a large size James Brown bobble head and dances around with it, and then puts it center stage to be filmed as they do the ""Feel Good, Feel Good"" movements! Maybe she was nervous because her daughter is the in the video with her young college friends, so she is trying to be hip???? I don't get it. The exercise routine is static and does not flow. Again, I paid a price for this video, and wish I would have returned it. My review would be 0 rating on this.",1517529600,,1281,4.107569721115538
8187421,5,B000OYCMMQ,"This is the best workout video that I own and it will always be my default video. It works for weight loss and overall well being! Leslie's claim is true: If you take the 10 day challenge, you will loose a dress size. It worked for me, my mom, my brother and other family members. I found no fault with the video production. Even if I did, who cares. It's all about results. I'm so glad I found Leslie nearly 15 years ago. Her programs and love has helped me to loose over 30+ pounds and keep it off over the years.",1508976000,,515,4.0588235294117645
