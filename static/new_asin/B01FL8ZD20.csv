7750787,1,B01FL8ZD20,Or maybe a C or D movie. I realized it in less than 5 minutes. I wish it was possible to return a movie after watching it for 5 minutes!,1473120000,2,136,3.566666666666667
7750788,1,B01FL8ZD20,"Too graphic, should have had an R rating.",1473033600,2,41,4.25
7750789,1,B01FL8ZD20,"Poorly done, I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes.  Wasted $4.00.",1473033600,2,74,4.6923076923076925
7750790,1,B01FL8ZD20,"Subpar plot, acting and script.  Not worth the time or money.  While I love movies with these types of storylines, there were plenty of gaps and the acting may have been a result of a script and lines so cheesy they couldn't do much more than go through the motions.",1472601600,5,266,4.3
7750791,5,B01FL8ZD20,I love this movie,1472169600,,17,3.5
7750792,5,B01FL8ZD20,What a SURPRISE! Fun Fun Fun movie. And that 'Fight Scene'....WOW!,1471910400,,66,5.090909090909091
7750793,5,B01FL8ZD20,"What a great little movie. Homages action movies of the 90s in a fun and retrospective way. Has a message, which is more than most indie action movies can say. If you grew up on 90s action and love a smart movie that knows what it is and what it's setting out to accomplish, go for Beta Test.",1470700800,,292,4.051724137931035
7750794,3,B01FL8ZD20,"Andrew Kincaid (Linden Ashby) is the CEO of Sentinel Gaming Systems. He has developed a new system that puts players ""in the game."" Orson Creed (Manu Bennett) developed systems with Sentinel, but wanted to use certain systems for the military where Kincaid is simply a gamer. Max Troy (Larenz Tate) world champion gamer is his ""secret weapon"" tester.

Kincaid kidnaps Creed's wife (Sara Coates) and places a device on Creed's neck that gives gamer Max control over him. Max quickly realizes he is not playing an ordinary game and wants out, but Kincaid makes him an offer he can't refuse.

Max, the main character was bland, a problem that plagues a lot of science fiction. Max figures out the game too fast and the film takes a turn too early. The early montage sets up an artificial message the film didn't convey.

I did not enjoy this film as much as my peers. Available at Walmart. 2 1/2 stars

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1470614400,,935,4.648484848484848
7750795,4,B01FL8ZD20,"This is an 1980s-felling action-thriller flick. It has a lot of the elements of the direct-to-video action thrillers of that era. The main cast, Bennett, Tate, and Ashby, are good in their respective roles. The supporting cast is what one would expect in this type of movie, kinda-sorta-bad, but appropriate to the genre. The six-plus-minute continuous fight scene is incredible; kudos to the cast, stunt-people, and stunt choreographer. It is worthy of a fun-filled view party with family and friends.",1470009600,4,502,5.2875
8761075,5,B01FL8ZD20,Great movie and a cool premise.  Manu kicks ass as always.,1515110400,,58,4.2727272727272725
8761076,3,B01FL8ZD20,"Beta Test sort of has a budget move feel to it, although it does have some actors in some of the supporting roles you'll recognise, not from blockbusters but they're familiar.  Basic premise is a rich game developer after a pretty lengthy TV interview scene where he's going on about gun control for way too long, gets a thing put into the back of his neck allowing him to be controlled by a video game player.  At first a top video player thinks he's playing a new game, but then begins to realise it's real when news reports match what he has just done.  But his girlfriend (who's he's never met because he hasn't left his house in years) will be killed if he doesn't keep playing.

There's plenty of fight scenes, some it's a bit obvious kicks miss and arms don't connect with faces but the film is entertaining enough.  It's nothing special but will pass the time.",1511568000,,868,4.433962264150943
8761077,5,B01FL8ZD20,"I really enjoyed this film, and highly recommend it! Interesting plot and I loved the long take fight scene. Definitely my favorite indie action movie ",1511136000,,151,5.04
8761078,5,B01FL8ZD20,Its a great movie. I recommend,1510790400,,30,4.166666666666667
8761079,1,B01FL8ZD20,"I give this movie a one star, albeit it might actually deserve two.

The reason I give it a one star is because the filmmaker infamously created hundreds of socks on IMDb to tamper with the rating of the film, and it appears he's been trying to do the same here.

Anyway Larenz Tate is the only saving grace of the film, the rest is dirt-poor.",1502150400,,343,4.181818181818182
8761080,1,B01FL8ZD20,It was awful!  I didn't get through the first half hour,1489104000,2,55,4.0
8761081,2,B01FL8ZD20,"Not sure if Manu Bennett actually has the voice of a testosterone-soaked chainsaw struggling through a brick wall, but it's fun to listen to.
That being said, every directing, writing, and editing choice made in this film was utter garbage. We struggled to the end.
These two stars are only for Crixus, god of the arena.",1485561600,3,320,4.732142857142857
8761082,5,B01FL8ZD20,"Excellent film! I love the way it shows how people can get ""sucked"" into a video game in a different manner. It also shows how the love of money and power can control a person's actions.",1481241600,,186,4.194444444444445
