5231964,5,B00915G6Q2,Blue bloods continues to live up to and beyond our expectations. Tom Selleck leaves us wanting more. I look forward to each new episode with the anticipation of a school girl waiting for her first date. Lol,1350345600,,206,4.594594594594595
5231965,5,B00915G6Q2,"New Comments begin with ""The Bitter End"", fourth paragraph down.

Often, a successful series will gradually lose its edge as other, more popular, programs come along.  ""Blue Bloods"" contains a familial bond across generations in the setting of police work - a Walton's in New York City.  The actors have always shown tight performances, nothing melodramatic, just good story telling.

In this episode, the dialogue felt taken out of a script guide to police dramas.  The introduction of a kidnapping with an accompanying bomb seemed over the top, a dramatic flare unnecessary to make what has been a solid performer, work.  In fact, that entire story line with the over arching theme that ""love conquers all"" made Danny's declaration of love for his wife seem out of character:  restraint has always been the hallmark of this family's affection.

The tight-lipped performance by Tom Selleck was a pleasure to see again and while the overt following of his convictions again was not very subtle, it carried this otherwise weak episode.  It is always good to fantasize that a truly powerful person will do what is right and not necessarily what is popular.

""The Bitter End"" is a heartbreaking tale that reflects an ongoing issue throughout urban America:  public housing and gang control of that housing through drug sales and armaments.  The people caught in the middle, as illustrated in this episode, are the honest, hard working people trying to survive at poverty level under constant threat of violence.

In the process of examining this issue dramatically, a young woman jumps from a public housing building holding her infant son and a police officer is killed.  Meantime, policy making by the DA has loosened the ties to trying perpetrators unless there is a guarantee ""win.""  Often, cases are dismissed because of victims' refusal to testify, understandably, under threat of a gang that will kill them or their loved ones.  This is all within the realm of the possible and even probable and the idea that it is still true in LA, NYC, Chi-town, and other large urban centers is heartbreaking.

This story is not only worth telling, it must be told to all of us who think this type of living situation does not exist or if it does not exist for us, does not matter.  This story says, to ""The Bitter End"" it matters to the people who live in these communities.  Home should be a sanctuary, ultimately, and not the place where one must dodge bullets and shooting up.  The first of a two part episode.",1348876800,3,2505,4.835680751173709

5232058,1,B00915G6Q2,Pure garbage ... a disfunctional family that will leave you with absolutely nothing positive. Avoid at all costs.

5232059,1,B00915G6Q2,"If you're a Republican, this show panders to you. Go forth and love every moment. Not a Right Winger? This show will offend your every sensibility.

They say ""forthwith,"" ""You're a Reagan,"" and other phrases so often, it's mind numbing.

There is a lot of praying at the dinner table (when they aren't arguing or talking about heinous crimes in front of the kids). If you're religious, you'll love it. If you're not, you'll just find it annoying and cloying.

Donnie Wahlberg's character gives cops a bad name. He's beating suspects, threatening them, using excessive force, etc, with zero consequences. It's disturbing to watch.

""Erin"" is a flat, boring character, which is a shame because they could have made her a very strong female lead. This would have been great, as there are zero other strong female characters.

The grandpa is a boring old coot, Danny's passive wife is apparently fine with her husband's antics, and Tom Selleck is a self-righteous, thinly veiled bigot.

The cast is all white, with no diversity at all. Boring to watch and not true to life (unless you live in rural Alabama). The bad guys are nearly all black or brown, with an occasional white person thrown in for a twist.

The only character I like is the rookie cop brother (although he went through 8 years of Harvard schooling and then decided to be a beat cop? Yeah, probably not).

My breaking point was Tom Selleck's character saying a woman's sexual assault claim couldn't be true because the accused was someone who'd baptized his kids and was a ""good"" person. Oh, really? Nice police work and great rape culture talk. Blech.

With so many stellar shows to choose from, BB gets a hard pass.",1494288000,,1680,4.745704467353952

5232152,5,B00915G6Q2,"The wonderful CBS television series ""Blue Bloods"" provides its viewers with the masterful assimilation of a police drama into a larger family drama. This third season of ""Blue Bloods"" continues its depiction of the lives of four generations of the Reagan law enforcement dynasty, a family which has a rich tradition of both police service, as well as military service. Most episodes are structured around a specific police case, which is typically associated with some type of an ethical or moral dilemma, along with other complicating factors. ""Blue Bloods"" focuses more on the fundamental relationships between its characters, rather than on action and mayhem. The weekly Sunday dinner, featuring the four generations of the Reagan family sharing a meal, as well as pertinent stories, vigorous debates, and fatherly and grandfatherly advice, is decidedly heartwarming, and gives the show a gratifying interpersonal touch. The actors of ""Blue Bloods,"" led by Tom Selleck, Donnie Wahlberg, and Bridget Moynahan, consistently deliver excellent performances, and are truly the heart of the show. I give the outstanding police and family drama, ""Blue Bloods,"" an enthusiastic five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,1228,5.572192513368984

5232738,5,B00915G6Q2,"Many things to recommend with this series.  Tom Selleck does an excellent job as the patriarch of the Reagan family, which is the highlight of the story, who meet at his house each Sunday for dinner and real discussions of their very interesting lives.  The Reagans , the first family of the NYPD, are a terrific group, and each week is filled with police and legal stories of the first order.  Four generations of Reagans are present at the Sunday dinners and the interplay and education that accompanies dinner is superb writing and makes me yearn for days of old.  The weekday action, both policing and legal is well done and is also instructive to me at a time like ours when police are under the microscope and often criticized . Bridget Moynahan, the only Reagan who becomes a lawyer rather than a cop continues to develop as a fine actress as well as a beauty.  This one has my highest rating.",1478649600,,900,4.530864197530864

5232889,5,B00915G6Q2,"I love Blue Bloods.  I wish Amazon would hurry up and post some additional seasons.  Sure they take some literary license with situations and characters, but it IS a tv show.  The actors are all great and well cast and the story lines have (amazingly) stayed interesting and fresh.  Who doesn't LOVE Tom Selleck?!  I even enjoy re-watching episodes I have seen several times.

You'll like the Reagan's and their real family antics so much you'll want to pull a chair up to the table for their Sunday family dinners. The casting of the main characters is excellent however there are way to many Soprano actors popping up in this show. Matched against the talents of Selleck, Wahlberg, Moynahan and Estes you can see how limited these other actors are. In a lot of scenes you'll catch them making faces to cover their inferior acting ability.

The family's Catholic faith being it's foundation and strength added an facet unique and refreshing. Seasons 1 & 2 you saw individuals of the Reagan family struggle with their faith as well as turn to their faith during times of struggle, without watering down or mocking the Catholic Church. Now, it's all about subversion. It's all, ""I'm a Catholic, but I'm okay with your immoral behavior"" nonsense. I was so hopeful this was a series that was helping to do its part and restore a sense of faith, family, and fidelity back to TV, but no such luck.",1470528000,,678,4.803418803418803

This is the Hallmark of this great Prime Time Show. May their tribe grow and grow and grow! This season carries on the tradition of family tremendously well.",1468713600,,286,4.627450980392157
5233823,5,B00915G6Q2,Family oriented show who are not afraid to show their faith. But good cop show too. Nobody is perfect or a know-it-all. Not to mention Tom Selleck.  Third time around on this series for me.,1468713600,,189,4.4
5233824,5,B00915G6Q2,"This show is so good, I can't believe it is still on the air.  Examples:
- Excellent gun handling, way better than most cop shows.  Excellent trigger discipline, and realistic shots. No ""Glock cocking"" (playing a hammer cocking sound when a striker-fired pistol is pointed; you see this all over movies and TV)

- Actual, seriously-treated prayer at the Reagan's Sunday dinners.  Linda and Henry seem to be the most faithful in the family, but Francis (Selleck's character) is portrayed as going to Mass every weekend.  Danny the detective even has a moment where his lack of faith in God is challenged.  Good stuff.

- Integrity is the overriding characteristic of the Police Commissioner (played by Selleck), the ADA, the detective and the younger Reagan cop.  They try to take the moral high road, every time, even if they bend the rules a little bit.  Selleck's character is the epitome of class.  Even if he KNOWS someone is guilty of doing something wrong, and the other person knows he knows it, he doesn't mention it, but gives the other person the benefit of the doubt.  Selleck's character is constantly making references to Teddy Roosevelt, who at one point was Police Commissioner of NYC, before he became POTUS.

- It is mentioned once that the detective's kid might get a spanking.  Amazing!  I thought the Progressives had destroyed all references to parental discipline on TV!
- Danny the detective shows his kid the four rules of gun handling, and then when his wife goes ballistic, actually makes the case that the kid needs to know!  Astounding!  I would have thought the Progressive censors would have DELETED that scene!

The understanding of the problems a city, the police and residents can face comes to a head in this story of the projects, gangs, drugs and the complexity of dealing with the seemingly impossible in a sensitive way. This series has become better and better as it goes on. There is a large cast in ""The bitter end"" and the acting is superb throughout.",1466812800,,527,4.28

I especially like the family aspect and the repartee of the weekly dinner. In addition, the writing is very good and well above the average ""police"" drama. Also, rather than just watching another TV show, I get the feeling I'm being allowed to watch a slice of life of a real family with all its ups and downs. One of the truly great things about this series is its family values; their belief in each other, in justice and in the system within which they work. Despite the disagreements among the family members, their love, respect and support for each other is clear and without doubt.",1454544000,,693,4.642276422764228

Is there right way to serve justice or can justice be served by unrighteous short cuts to ""serve justice?""  Well done in showing that the means and the ends are just as important in the service of justice.  Also, the family interconnections allows for several different plots of the story to run at the same time which increases the tension and drama of the individual episode.  The consistent standards towards higher morality in this series allows for one's family to watch it, at least the older children.  If, it goes to the lower standard of the typical ""Cop"" ""Detective"" shows on TV, then I believe there will be a drop in viewers because of the immorality shown as having no right or wrong, including use of double speak and the vulgar language.",1453507200,,846,4.651006711409396

The people are believable and have personalities; one can identify with them.  We are working our way through all the available seasons, and we are now well into Season 3.

In fact me and my wife live 375 miles from our families and this show will sometimes make us homesick (the only down side to the show). It's a family oriented show, with at times some real to life stories. There is some violence and it's not for children, but it is a police drama based in New York. But they don't dwell on the violence at all. All in all a very good show.",1448323200,,504,4.101010101010101

It teaches that integrity and honesty still mean something, that the good guys may not always win but keep trying anyway, that family means more than most things in life, and that doing the right thing often means doing the hard thing. Tom Selleck plays his role to perfection and the other actors/actresses also come across as genuine people with weaknesses and strengths.

Although the shows are pretty predictable and even repetitive in plot, the characters are family to each other and because of my heritage, to me as well. The shows actors portrait the complexities of their characters well, within the family, and their fictional community. Thanks for a show that upholds character and supports family unity.",1446249600,,583,4.84

5238609,5,B00915G6Q2,"One of the best police drama series ever.
The cast is uniformly excellent, especially Tom Selleck, who has matured considerably as an actor since his days as Magnum P.I.
The stories, in my opinion, lean a bit further than I should like toward portraying law enforcement generally in a favorable light, but it is nevertheless entertaining, and vastly superior to the general run of network TV fare these days.

There are divergences in a couple of the later episodes in season 3 - divergences which seem to expend inordinate energy in the service of PC hat-tipping to feminism, ie Erin gets a 'big-time' promotion offer from her new boss, a 'boss' who appears out of thin air and is, coincidentally, also a woman, a never-before-seen young girl wins a local race at an historically male-dominated 'soap-box' derby plus the tiresome inclusion of Hillary's ""It Takes A Village"" collectivist catch-phrase - uttered by Det.

5238859,4,B00915G6Q2,"The acting is very good but sometimes there are unbelievable scenarios the writers set up in order to have a plot.  For example, Erin the ADA is jogging down the street in New York in an obviously run down neighborhood. She notices that there is a van following her down the street. She looks back several times at the van but then proceeds to jog into a deserted alley. This is a gal who was attacked in her own office by a criminal who tried to kill her.  There is no way she would have run down the alley!
But, if you can swallow your disbelief on things like that, the acting is really good and many of the storylines are exciting and well done.",1438214400,,649,4.184

Blue Bloods is the exception.  This program is one of the best programs on television.  It appeals to the conservative and liberal viewer.  The consistent family values of each episode if rarely seen in programing today and it is pure delight.  This program provides the law and order side as well as decent family values.

5239162,5,B00915G6Q2,"I think I must be getting old; there is something deeply satisfying about this cosy family cop show although I still stand by my comments for season two: ""it is still reassuringly safe, mawkishly Catholic, populated by caricatures and about as edgy as a pair of children's safety scissors"". Maybe I'm still basking in the warm post-Christmas glow, but the portrayal of the close nuclear family and simple, neat storylines is an oddly appealing counterpoint to dysfunctional relationships and emotionally gruelling narratives that are more commonly presented as `entertainment'.

The mighty Tom continues to look like a well groomed version of my Dad and is the undisputed mainstay of the show, huffing and puffing his way amiably through the day's trials & tribulations dispensing worldly pearls of wisdom while the rest of the cast continue to fulfil their allotted roles (yes, Danny the wonderboy supercop is still over-acting). However, as the seasons have progressed, each character has acquired more depth & personality and the storylines cleverly exploit this (or is it the other way around? It is pretend, after all).

There is more complexity to the city hall political shenanigans; there is an uncharacteristically long narrative thread leading to Danny actually getting in trouble; Erin's teenage daughter Nicole is significantly less annoying and contributes meaningfully to the storyline and young Jamie seems constantly embattled by professional and moral dilemmas. We even have a decent two part finale leading inevitably to a happy, cheesy, improbably agreeable ending for the good people of the Regan family.

True Detective or The Wire it is not and doesn't even pretend to be; it's more of a cold flannel on a fevered brow, a nice cup of hot chocolate in front the fire sort of a show. There's nothing wrong with a bit of gentle fantasy now and again. I instinctively feel that I should dislike and ridicule Blue Bloods (I was a bit scathing in my review of Season one) but I just can't help liking it.",1421539200,,2020,5.06006006006006

5239242,5,B00915G6Q2,"Blue Bloods - Season Three  [569 2014-10-03]

Summary:
The location is contemporary New York City and the theme is a police procedural from a unique prospective. The shows focus around the Regan family: his oldest son Danny (Danny Wahlberg) a hotshot detective; another son Jamie is Harvard educated but by choice a beat patrolman; Frank (Tom Selleck) is the Police Commissioner cop; daughter Erin is an assistant D.A. and Henry - Frank's father, a former NYC Police Commissioner. Another son, a NYC policemen, killed in the line of duty, is an off stage presents in many episodes. Rounding out the cast are Danny's wife Linda, single mom Erin's precocious daughter and Danny's two sons.

Content:
The Season Three package consists of 6 disks and 23 episodes originally show on CBS during the period September 2012 through May 2013. Also included are several special features on disk 6.

Positive Comments:
 Many fewer deleted scenes in season three, which is unfortunate since they are usually quite interesting.
 Season three incorporated two major changes to the story formula: Danny's detective partner Jackie departed from the show early on and his wife Linda resumed working as a nurse at a local hospital.
 Danny's replacement detective is always a hottie yet there is never a hint of hanky-panky.
 With Danny's wife working in the hospital...well you know all of her husband Danny's suspects and vics are sent to the same hospital...and yes his wife is usually the caregiver. Well, it TV Land folks!
 I greatly admire the Regan family. They ague, rage against one another sometimes, but all are pulling the wagon in the same direction.
 It was refreshing to see a show with an honest focus on genuine family values even with members who are contrary and strongly opinionated.
 I continue to enjoy the New York City local for these episodes. That city has so many neighborhoods both glamorous and shabby and the show is a case study in urban renewal if you ask me.
 It was nice to see the children of Erin and Danny getting some roles instead on being the usual window dressing.

The Cast:
Tom Selleck and Danny Wahlberg are terrific in their roles. Other cast members are very good - I particularly admire Danny Regan's female detective partner (Jennifer Esposito) but as mentioned she has departed from the show.

Negative Comments:
 Honestly I can't say much negative except what doesn't Frank (Tom Selleck) the Police Commissioner cozy up to his beautiful secretary. He has been a widow for years and they seem well matched.
 One episode found Frank testing the romantic waters with a friend of daughter Erin. Well, Erin blew a fuse - like Dad and one of my girl friends - no way!! Seemed out of character for Erin and the whole episode was unbelievable to this viewer.

Recommendations:
This is a highly recommend show that over three seasons has keep my interest. If police procedurals within the context of a strong family appeal to you I believe you will enjoy viewing season 3 of Blue Bloods.",1412208000,,3008,4.866666666666666

Some of the most interesting and dynamic parts of the show are played out around the family's dinning room table. Donnie Wahlberg plays a hard headed detective that seems to solve every case and causes much of what the family has a hard time digesting. What sets this show apart is the explanation of what happens on the job of a cop, prosecutor or police commissioner to the children of the family some times the answer involves prayer which I think is great.
 I would recommend  this show to an adult audience.",1402531200,,791,4.337837837837838

There  is a Christian moral theme that supports a strong family bond without the unnecessary profanity, nudity and sexual immorality that seems to be the emphasis of so many television shows now days.

5239337,3,B00915G6Q2,"The story content was excellent, as are all Blue Bloods episodes.  However, this DVD set was apparently set by default to always come up with script written at the bottom.  Going to the controls and resetting to take away the distraction lasted only for the episode showing.  The very next episode came up with writing at the bottom.  It was very annoying to have to go back each time and reset things to take that away.  I've never had a DVD like that before.  Everything else was fine.

5239376,5,B00915G6Q2,"I watch a lot of TV.  I search for the ""quality shows"", meaning television programs that have good writing, good photography, good editing, and likeable characters that inter-mix well within the show and plot lines.  This show delivers week in and week out, and is a good show to watch as a family as well.  I have watched and own all seasons of this show.  The only downside is they got rid of Jennifer Esposito, the partner of Danny Reagan played by Don Wahlberg.  She was great in this season three rollout but had a squabble with power-dudes, and they cut her.  So, season 4 is a little off with the new gal-pal-partner.  I use the Amazon Instant Video to buy and download, so I watch the show, either one at a time or most times, a solid binge-watching event as you get hooked and truly enjoy the storylline of this cop family.

most of them . I also feel he is good as a police officer . His roll as the New York City Police Commissioner and head of his
family is excellent . Donnie Wahlberg , Bridget Moynahan , Will Estes and Len Cariou round out the family members who
keeps everyone busy . Tom Selleck does a great job as a cop . I have all of his Jessie Stone DVD's and watch them all
the time . Blue Bloods is a blend of the family fighting street crime and family problems , with Tom Selleck as Commissioner,
and referee . All the episodes are good as well as the acting . It is a pretty down to earth series with the plots resembling
families everyday life . -------Rich mellinger",1379721600,,905,4.1477272727272725

(The other two are White Collar and Elementary.) Blue Bloods has the advantage of having four unique characters in major roles, and that contributes strongly to keeping the show interesting. Additionally the aforementioned family discussions around the Sunday dinner table are where the four characters debate their different views of police work.

I loved Donnie from Band of Brothers and his character in Blue is just as strong.

Tom may be old and still Magnum P.I.  But he still is a great actor.  Maybe watching bits of that show and seeing the Jesse Stone movies has helped me prep for Tom as a NY Police Commissioner.  (When we watch the new show Golden Boy we joke and say that Walter Clark is the commissioner after Tom).

The show has none stop action.  There is lots of typical police chases and interrogations.  But there's also good character development.  And the Sunday mandatory dinner is a good touch.

What I'm not quite getting is why Donnie's character has now gone through 3 police partners.  Does nobody like his character or something?

The Irish-American Reagan family is alive and kicking.  Tom Selleck shines as Frank Reagan, the ever stalwart New York City Police Commissioner, perinatal family man and all around good guy.

Grandpa Henry Reagan (Len Cariou), retired Police Commissioner, is still with us.  Having in past seasons survived a heart attack, the death of his son and more.  This season he survives an attack and robbery by an armed gunman, along with a huge bump to his head and ego.  He's also forced to up driving.  (getting old sucks)

Bridget Moynahan is back as Erin Reagan-Boyle, Assistant District Attorney and Mom to Niki (Sami Gayle) now 16 and driving.  In Episode 3, Erin becomes Erin Reagan, after dropping Boyle from her last name.

The brothers Tony and Andrew Terraciano are still playing Sean and Jack, sons of Danny and Linda (Amy Carlson) Reagan.  Money's still tight for Danny and Linda Reagan, so Danny's working overtime and Linda's back working as an E.R. RN.

Jennifer Esposito (Detective Curatola - placed on indefinite leave of absence) was dropped from the series, after suffering from complications of Celiac Disease.  Which means Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg) is now partnered yet an other replacement partner ::: currently Detective Candice McElroy (Megan Boone - formerly of Law & Order LA).

Jamie Reagan (Will Estes) has a colorful new partner Officer Vinny Cruz (Sebastian Sozzi).

David Ramsey returns as New York City Mayor Carter Poole.  Peter Hermann is back as Jack Boyle, Erin's ex-husband lawyer and father to Niki.  Watch episode 3, when Erin removes Boyle from her name.  Gregory Jbara is back as NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Garrett Moore.  Garrett gets into hot water after a poorly thought out dalliance turns into black mail and possibly the loss of his job.

The only downside to this, was the exit of Jennifer Esposito who played Detective Jackie Curatola. Due to a health issue, she was not able to stay with the demands of the show.

5239743,5,B00915G6Q2,"The CBS crime drama ""Blue Bloods"", about a family of New York City policemen, returns for a superb third season in 2012-2013.  A strong cast is headed by Tom Selleck as Frank Reagan, New York City Police Commissioner and head of the Reagan family, which includes his father (Len Cariou), a retired police commissioner; his daughter Erin (Bridget Moynihan), a hard-charging deputy district attorney; son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg), a highly effective but rules-bending detective; and youngest son Jamie (Will Estes), a new beat cop finding his way on the force.

A great strength of the show is its nice balance of crime-of-the-week police procedural and extended family drama.  Issues at work seem to find their way home to the Reagan Sunday family dinner table, where Frank is often called upon to referee family disputes, whether on the outing privileges of a teenage granddaughter or breaking up competition between Erin and Danny over the handling of a case.  A second great strength of the show is its willingness to portray honestly the difficult issues that require tough choices out of one or more family members.  Danny's wife often fears for his life, while Frank sweats out his youngest son's undercover duties and his grandaughter's dates.  In one episode, Frank's father is brutally mugged at an ATM; son Jamie earns the wrath of his police commissioner father for his rough handling of the suspected thief.  One sad change this season was the abrupt departure of Jennifer Esposito as Danny's partner Jackie Curatola; Danny will work with a number of possible successors.

""Blue Bloods"" is highly recommended to its fans as a solid, uniquely family-oriented police procedural.",1355184000,56,1686,5.127737226277373
