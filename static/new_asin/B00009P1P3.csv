This specific DVD comes in at 47 minutes, 15 minutes short of the film's actual 62 minute run time.  Avoid this turkey like a cursed jewel.",1246406400,2,257,4.3125
1887361,4,B00009P1P3,"This is another good movie I purchased recently.  While the plot is somewhat predictable, the acting is good and the black and white adds to the somewhat scary atmosphere created.  I recommend it.",1212019200,,196,4.909090909090909
1887362,1,B00009P1P3,"I ordered this movie because I'm a dedicated fan of actor David Manners.  Instead of receiving the Gotham Distribution version pictured here, I received the Alpha Video DVD release of ""The Moonstone"".  This version of the film is *not* worth adding to your collection, at least as presented on this DVD.  The original running time of ""The Moonstone"" was 62 minutes; here it runs only 47 minutes, meaning that one-fourth of the movie is missing!  And the footage that remains is scratchy and jumpy, with grade Z contrast ... not even remotely worth watching for a glimpse of cult actor Manners.
The Alpha Video DVD does contain a second feature, a creaky 1931 mystery named ""Murder at Midnight"".  Unfortunately, it also is a bottom-of-the-barrel transfer of a film that wasn't any too interesting to begin with.  Best to avoid this selection until a better, more complete version makes it to DVD.",1073520000,28,895,4.894039735099338

7992187,5,B00009P1P3,"Ignore the reviews here! Somehow Amazon has screwed up and these reviews are for an old black and white movie of The Moonstone. This is a recent BBC mini series. Each episode is about an hour long and it is a well done adaptation of Wilkie Collins famous book, The Moonstone, known for being the first detective novel ever. Wilkie Collins is a favorite writer of mine so I was hoping for a lot! This mini series is very well made. Yes, like with most novels, some things have been added or changed but the characters and story are there. A well to do young girl is given a diamond stolen from the statue of an Indian god by her uncle. The next day the 'moonstone' is gone. The house was filled with servants, friends and family along with a band of mysteries Indians claiming to be entertainers. Who stole the diamond, why and what secret is the young girl and sad maid hiding? It is great fun. And well told. A little side note: Wilkie Collins knew about laundanum. He was addicted to it.",1511740800,7,989,4.351351351351352
7992188,5,B00009P1P3,"I love old stories, especially mysteries, like this.  It starts like a fairy tale in India and travels to England.  Threads of the plot twist and turn throughout, until the final episode reveals the full truth.  Yes, it is excellent.",1510272000,,233,4.775
7992189,5,B00009P1P3,"An amazing mystery story with a great plot good acting and an ending you will never see coming. The picture is good as is the sound. A very good movie if you like a good mystery. You also get a second movie, ""Murder at Midnight"". The picture is fair, in the second movie but the sound is good. You will find the plots of the two movies to be very good with on going action in both movies. No what I call filler that so often causes the movie to drag on giving no real meaning to the plot. You won't find any filler in these two movies.",1415318400,,535,3.962962962962963

7992191,1,B00009P1P3,"It doesn't make any difference whether this is a shortened or full version of the subject film.  Since it is a bare representation of the story from which it obtains its title, a shorter edition is actually a mercy.  Hollywood is known for its very loose adaptations, but this one is way beyond the pale.  You could go on and on with the changes in characters, place and unfolding.  Any other version would be superior viewing to this poorly scripted, casted and acted, cobwebby old bit of hokum.",1375228800,,496,4.6022727272727275
7992192,2,B00009P1P3,"The 1934 movie ""The Moonstone"" is an adaptation of Wlkie Collins' classic mystery novel of the same name, about a fabled and supposedly cursed valuable Indian gem that goes missing inside a English country house during a birthday party.  In the original novel, the subsequent task of detection takes two years to play out.  In this movie version of ""The Moonstone"", the four hundred fifty page novel is compressed into the one hour movie format of the period.  The result is a truncated story that takes place almost entirely inside the Verinder country home, with two brief scenes set in London.  The many well-developed characters of the novel have been reset to get them into the action inside the house.  Fortunately, most of the key plot points are still present.  The 1934 film stock has seen better days, but is still acceptable for viewing.

Unfortunately, this particular version of the movie is only 46 minutes long and obviously clumsily edited down from its original length of 62 minutes.  The storyline will probably make sense only to those already familiar the novel.  This version of ""The Moonstone"" may of interest to film buffs wishing to compare it with later and more elaborate versions.",1323043200,4,1207,4.935643564356436
7992193,2,B00009P1P3,"The Moonstone, 1934 film

The story begins with a view of the river in London. A very valuable yellow diamond was taken from a temple in India. Inspector Cuff will go to see Franklin Blake about safeguarding this jewel. Van Locker, a visitor from London, arrives to see Sir John Verinder about a past-due loan. Ann Verinder loves Franklin Blake but another man Godfrey loves her (and her wealth). The Moonstone is admired by all for its varying colors. It should be placed in a bank vault. The storm causes a loss of electricity. In the dark someone snatched the jewel from Ann's bed! Was it the servant to safeguard it? Sir John the doctor leaves to attend at a birth. It is a stormy night. Sir John returns. Someone sneaks in to Ann's room at night to steal the Moonstone!

The other guests are notified. Sir John is found on the floor, very ill with a fever. They call Scotland Yard, but the line is dead. Inspector Cuff arrives and notices the smeared paint on the door. He will question everyone in the house. The answers tells us about the characters. Will they give Sir John more medicine to see its effects? Anyone else? Godfrey? Van Locker? Inspector Cuff solves the theft. [Weren't the guilty obvious?] It seems this movie was drastically shortened to eliminate some scenes. Was it changed much from the novel?

I never read the novel by Wilkie Collins. The character of Inspector Cuff was inspired by a real police detective who tried to solve the murder of a young boy. His solution was rejected for political reasons. Years later a confession proved his suspicions.",1289520000,,1578,4.648745519713262
