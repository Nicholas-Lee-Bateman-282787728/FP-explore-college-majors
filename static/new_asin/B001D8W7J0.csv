3527642,4,B001D8W7J0,"Midnight Movie is a great film. I thought the acting was very good for today standards, considering all teen actors today seem to just swear and smoke pot in horror films. The killer looked like a smaller, weaker version of Batman villian Bane. The kills in this film were plain and only one i'd consider gory. The plot was simple with a few holes in it. The ending did leave room for a sequel in the near future but I hope they don't make anther film, this was perfect and was only an hour and twenty minutes. Cook up a bag of popcorn and enjoy this well done horror flick.

I love horror films that take place in the theaters and if you enjoyed this film, then i'd highly recommend the film Popcorn but thats out of print and might cost alot.",1241049600,,744,4.23943661971831
3527643,4,B001D8W7J0,"This at its core a supernatural slasher film.  Like all slasher films it is required to have a masked killer who uses a specialised cutting implement to dispatch teens in a particular setting.  Like most supernatural films it comes with specific rules and otherworldly occurances and lapses in logic to circumvent said killer.  The film works in both its horror subgenres.

Now at first glance the basic premise of the film sounds like Bava's gore/monster classic DEMONS.  Sure, that's partially true.  It's about a group of people going to see a midnight horror film in an old theater, and then having the horrifying images on the screen come to life and effect the audience in gruesome ways.  But that's where the similarities end and the innovation begins.  While I love DEMONS, I have to admit beyond the monster effects, soundtrack, cinematography and basic premise, the film brings nothing new to the table that Romero hadn't already in his zombie films.  The satire about how movie violence effects its audience is there, but  Bava was more interested in the grue, so it gets buried.  This film leaves out the satire completely but builds a serious thriller out of it.

First let me praise God, Buddha, Allah, and Jesus that I have seen a slasher film with characters that are likeable and fleshed out--for the most part.  There not as in-depth as Hamlet but for this genre they seem real enough.  All the characters you're supposed to like, you do.  Hell, one character, the Biker, starts off as a loathesome character and then turned out to be my favorite character.  The best part about this film is that it works at getting you to like the people involved, but doesn't let that influence who lives and who dies.  There are some casualties in this film that will really make you wish they weren't.  I was very happy to actually watch a horror film not wishing for the characters' death, but rather rooting for them to escape.  Sometimes I was disappointed and sometimes I wasn't....just watch it for yourself if you want to catch my drift.

Now the movie is very violent and even has some intense gross out death scenes in it.  How it lays out each murder is rather clever.  Every time the horror film on the screen switches to the notorious Killer POV, made notorious by all 80's slasher films, the characters are clued into the fact that they may have to start running for their lives.  On the commentary track included on the dvd the director notes how each murder represented a different film style of killing people on screen.  The first are off-screen with only the aftermath shown.  As the bodycount rises so does the gore level.  We even get a torture-porn(on my quest to reclaiming that term still)sequence at the end that involves some toes and a lot of unpleasantness.  This is a fun concept for horror movie nerds and finatics.

The ending even goes somewhere you weren't expecting.  I won't ruin it, but it's fun and creepy and slips all the way into supernatural fantasy.  The film runs short, just about 80 minutes.  It's the perfect length for this type of film, a fluff terror piece with an original twist on an old concept.  I usually yearn for more when these things run short, but this one got it all right in less than 90 minutes: likeable characters, creative kills, an original idea for a new cineamtic maniac, and surprises and twists.

I really liked this film.  It's very under the radar so you might pass it by.  I only heard about it because it was elected dvd of the month in Fangoria a couple of months ago.  Check it out...NOW.",1240790400,24,3568,4.6528
3527644,4,B001D8W7J0,"....Considering most of the scare-free schlock direct to video movies out there.  The movie starts when a mis-guided or just plain stupid psychiatrist thinks letting the loon who directed a cheesy horror movie from the 60's watch his film will be beneficial therapy. Big mistake. The crazed director slaughters everyone in the asylum, escapes and then the fun begins.

Two couples and their gassy friend along with a biker and his chick as well as two detectives and an interloper, the kid brother of one of the girls watch the old black and white film ""The Dark Beneath"" which is a typical  slasher flick featuring the usual assortment of brain dead teens.

When the friend with gas problems has to make a mad dash to the toilet the movie on screen suddenly changes and they watch as their friend gets murdered by a masked maniac wielding a very sharp spiral orb which the killer uses to punch a hole in the victim and extract innards.  The friends in the audience think they have been punk'd until they go to the toilet and find blood and gore on the floor.

One by one the cast is picked off and the movie gets progressively more gruesome but not as gruesome as the fake butter glopped on popcorn at the concession stand.

The movie has many twists and turns and delivers the gore and best of all doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer. Good job, Good show.",1239494400,,1367,4.555102040816327
3527645,4,B001D8W7J0,"I really enjoyed ""midnight Movie""..
I'm not going to go through the plot because you can read the synopsis or long boring reviews for that.

My review is why a slasher, horror fan should buy it.
I found it to be highly original .I was interested in the story and characters on the movie screen in the theater in midnight Movie and particularly the story being told  when the killer came off the screen to terrorize the main characters ""in"" the theater.

This movie has a killer with an original weapon and original look, the plot on screen was very
 ""Texas Chainsaw -esque"",original  ? no , do we love it ? yes..Some say the killer has no personality. How much personality do you have to have to be menacing and make good kills?

Do we as slasher fans really care if he prefers Coke or Pepsi? I don't think so,just keep looking freaky and slashing people.

If you are a slasher fan you will Surely like and maybe even love this film.
It has some good kills, a couple of great ones good acting and it's well paced not at all boring.
nuff said.",1236816000,,1042,4.34020618556701
3527646,3,B001D8W7J0,"I really liked this movie. It  had a new fresh premise. Always a fan of the limited cast , with limited scenery, being stalked by a maniac. Since most horror movies are copycats, this was refreshing. I can conceive of this serial killer being the Jason for a new generation, even though this movie was not Friday the 13th. How creative for a superkiller to fluctuate between the movie and real life.  Wish the character who got electrocuted had been beaten up a while after what he did to his girlfriend.  His was the only character that made me want to root for the killer, who looked authentic. Would recommend to any horror fan.

Must watch all to understand, but definitely worth the viewing. Like how the movie lets us get to know and relate to each character. Basically everyone is running from the killer throughout most of the movie. But it is well worth the race.  Wish the boyfriend had survived. At least the killer did to chase more youngins throughout another theater in the sequel.",1236384000,,995,4.598870056497175

Whoa! This is an absolute bloody good time!

Here's the setup--A small group gathers at an old theater for a midnight screening of an 70's horror film. They get more than they bargained for.

Imagine watching the big screen and your buddy gets up to go to the bathroom. The film then intersects and you watch in horror as your pal gets heinously bludgeoned to death by a madman with a spiral screw.

Creepy! Initially the crowd squeals in morbid fascination, as they think they're part of a reality show. But no, they did not get Punk'd, they're about to donate blood. Bwhahahahaaa! Say your prayers chumps.

This movie is very well done. It's an original script, with some great old-school f/x(no CGI), adequate acting, believable gore scenes, nice camera work, plus a little nudity slipped in. A couple moments torward the end get slightly silly, but not too bad. Worth a look for the gore hounds, no doubt.",1231804800,3,994,4.823529411764706

I get that the director was purposefully trying to make a b-movie and that he was operating on the premise that this was going to be an intentionally ""b-movie"" b-movie, along with all the lame cliches that comprise those kinds of horror films.

3527662,3,B001D8W7J0,"A crazed lunatic (Arthur Roberts as Ted Radford) sits down to watch a movie he directed 40 years ago.  What, no snacks, no problem, he chews on his arm while watching his masterpiece, entitled The Dark Beneath.  When all is said and done, he vanishes and so does the entire psychiatric ward.  Fast forward five years later as a local theater features a midnight showing of said flick.  A very small group pays for the privilege of watching this audience participation/performance art piece.  The killer jumps back and forth between the real world and the reel world as he assembles a cache of victims for his black and white universe.

As far as plot devices go, it's more interesting than most.  But it's still just a slasher flick doing exactly what slasher flicks do.  It's all about the body count and the manner in which the victims are murdered.  In this case, he does it with a coiled knife of sorts.  It's unique but repetitious.  Most of the action takes place in a corridor infested Movie Theater that doesn't lack for hallways and space.  Part of the problem with this movie is it employs too many unlikeable characters who don't hang around for long.  And the villain gains strength through great costume design as opposed to intent.

I have limited space in my collection, I've seen it twice, I decided against keeping it because it wasn't sufficiently enthralling enough to justify watching it again.",1414800000,,1414,4.741803278688525

Still the film plays with space and time and existence, life, I guess, as we know it. Are the murdered still with us to be tortured again? Maybe. Can a film character, a killer, come off the screen?

It was entertaining and managed to scare me several times, which doesn't happen easily. Not like the typical mainstream slashers that come out today, this one has a much more classic slasher touch to it which I enjoyed.

3527683,1,B001D8W7J0,"If I could be so bold as to play a bit of the contrarian here, Midnight Movie is nothing spectacular.  It's not even good.  It's a banal, boring, and utterly forgettable film.  You will not enjoy it.  You will not be entertained.  It would be an entirely amicable situation, yet still entirely unlikely, to find yourself sitting through it from start to finish without succumbing to the overwhelming urge to turn off, tune out, and go to bed all together.  It's a film that revels in cliche.  This is a film you have seen a dozen times before, better or worse, though I suspect it would be quite difficult to be worse than this film without actively attempting to be terrible.  Midnight Movie isn't afraid to set the bar low.  Its premise, seemingly lifted from either the far more entertaining and gleefully stupid Demons or a much more watchable episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?, doesn't make it any more original or exciting.  The acting is perhaps average for a film of similar appetites at best and splintery, waterlogged wooden at average.  The plotting is pretty bland, things just kind of happen and trah-la-la.  The writing is about what you'd expect, all things considered: whimsical dialogue, panicky direction-giving, panicky shouting, a lot of Psalm 23 for some reason, etc.  Stock characters?  You bet, now complete with intimidating biker guy and saccharine boyfriend!  Trendy looking jump cutting?  Uh huh.  Tried and true jump scaring?  Attempted, anyway.  Forced subplot about primary characters living with domestic abuse for no other reason than to make the viewer sympathize?  Sure, why not.  To be fair, I have not had the distinct privilege of viewing this so-called ""Killer Cut."" However, I can pretty well assure you, dear reader, that this isn't Ridley Scott reworking Blade Runner.  Unless the director left an entirely different and, more importantly, good film on the cutting room floor, it's going to be the same thing, just with more fake blood, barely tolerable acting, and ignorable filmmaking in what I'm sure is a totally justifiable extension of the running time.  The film is uninteresting at 90 minutes, so why push the boundaries of too much making a bad thing worse?  I'd be inclined to give this film two stars for its usefulness in terms of mockery with a friend, but for the spamming of glowing reviews (nine nondescript customers saying basically the same thing and trundling into hyperbole is obvious enough, right, but all on the same day?  Deception at its finest: thinly veiled at best) comparing the film to...wait, Hitchcock?  Really?  Something of a reach there, isn't it?  Hell with it.  This film isn't worth the effort, original, director's cut, or otherwise.  I've had more interesting headaches.  Spare yourself the trouble and do something useful.  A power nap will never charge you 13 dollars, lie to you in waves about how great it is to convince you to buy it, and then disappoint with the end result.

He is half phantom, half slasher, or basically the best parts of Jason and Freddy combined. He wears a freakin human skull over his head. And oh yeah he can also pull a Pleasantville on you and jump in and out of the screen.  Without a doubt this film pays homage to the 1970 grindhouse experience, but don't be fooled daring voyeurs, because in contrast this film reinvents what a killer can and cannot do.

The interesting characters pull you in ( my fav is the biker gang couple) and the movie takes you on a ride full of surprises that heighten the tension, suspense and fear.. Reality itself begins to come apart as the movie progresses, engaging conversations that have been brought about by earlier films [camp, etc] and invades the familiar safe space of ""it's just a movie!"" bringing fear to stay when you shut the film off and try to tell yourself...

Soooo.... It starts as a soft thriller, but the plot gets progressively more twisted and the scenes bloodier and bloodier! As me and my friends started the movie I got hooked from the beginning to the very end!! So many awesome killing scenes that at some points I had to close my eyes!! Unlike any of the hundreds of horror movies the plot was great and also the ending had a very unexpected twist!
I would consider ""Midnight Movie"" a great movie for a date, just to have fun with some friends, or for dvd collections!",1306454400,2,769,4.273972602739726
3527687,5,B001D8W7J0,I'm so excited I got an early screening of Midnight Movie: The Killer Cut. I had seen the original version of Midnight Movie (which I loved) and was very impressed at the new shots and even more gruesome death scenes of the Killer Cut. I would have to say this new version makes the film even better. The actors chosen for this film are fantastic and portray the characters amazingly. I love how the film jumps between the movie in the film and the characters in the theater the film is showing at. The classic-style movie theater is the perfect set to create an immense amount of suspense that will have you on the edge of your seat or trying to hide behind the person next to you. All in all this is a must see to horror film lovers and it's a necessary addition to your DVD collection.,1306454400,2,788,4.295302013422819

Had a great plot line that isn't the typical ""scary movie"". I won't spoil alert but it involves a psycho spirit killer, movie theatre, hearts and lots of gore and death. Perfect combination with attractive actors :) I usually get nightmares but this one didn't give me any; I will just avoid creepy bathrooms & movie theatres at nighttime. Midnight Movie even had starring actresses Brea Grant (from Heroes) and Rebekah Brandes in it. The Killer Cut version is a great movie (also voted top 100 scariest scores of all time by XM Radio/Cinemagic) and I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining slasher to watch. I even checked out their website & it's pretty legit. Definitely worth watching if you're looking for a scare.",1306454400,,889,4.816993464052287

There's also this cool movie-in-a-movie aspect that brings it back to the present really well. I'm not a big fan of too much gore, but this was the perfect amount for me--it didn't fall back on it like some thrillers do. If you're already a fan of the original Midnight Movie, for the Killer Cut they include even more scenes, some of them re-done, and the quality of the special effects is awesome. Overall, really exciting and super freaky--a new favorite, for sure!",1306454400,3,644,4.707964601769912
3527690,5,B001D8W7J0,I got to see a screener of Midnight Movie: The Killer Cut. I must say I was surprised. It was a really fun and interesting slasher film. It had all the suspense and gore of a retro horror flick and stylistically reminded me of some 1980s movies. I loved the way they play with space in the movie. The characters are watching a movie in the movie and the killer is switching back and forth between the movie and the real-world theater. I thought it was really cool and original. I'd recommend this one to anyone who's tired of these re-hashed horror films out now... this one's a good change of pace.,1306454400,4,599,4.357142857142857

3527692,3,B001D8W7J0,"This film is definitely amateurish, there are minor plot holes, it isn't well written enough to create genuine tension, and I doubt anyone would bother watching the movie within the movie (except for the shower scene) so thankfully the ""real"" action is better.  But there are definite plusses to this film.  As another reviewer notes, the film actually has decent characters, not just dumb teens you want to see killed off.  The biker is a biker, but not a violent thug.  The cop isn't another one of the stereotypical horror film cops who is either a great hero or a semi-villain trying to pin murders on teens or a moron.  The teens goof off like teens will, but aren't walking, talking arguments for eugenics, if not corporal punishment. The characters actually show some logic, try stick together, work as a team and solve what is going on and escape their problem together.  You do really hate it whenever the cast fails and another is killed off.  And while there are violent deaths, the film isn't dependent upon over the top gore to keep up interest levels (not that that feat is perfected otherwise).

Despite being somewhat amateurish, you can tell all involved tried their best to put out as good a quality film as they could for the obviously low budget, and they obviously had fun trying to make a movie that would entertain.  You can also appreciate what they're trying to do with the plot even where it falls weak.  If I were still a 9 year old catching this on late night TV back when this sort of thing was forbidden fruit I would have loved it (especially the shower scene).  But as an adult, I think I'd stick to renting it.  If it weren't for the real effort you can see behind it, I think I would be less charitable with the rating -- it is not often these days that I feel so uncynical after watching a horror movie and that deserves at least some recognition.  On the other hand, it IS a bit retro for all the same reasons I liked it to some degree.  Maybe I'd even consider it a classic if it had been made in the 80s or earlier -- it would have compared quite well against, say, 200 Maniacs, etc.  So I'm not sure if I'm being unfairly harsh or unfairly easy on it.

This film had some potential, but cardboard characters and a flimsy script kept it from being anything but a routine slasher. The idea is pretty good, kind of like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' meets 'Last Action Hero', but it just doesn't deliver many chills. The last quarter of the film is better than the first three quarters, but it doesn't save this from being a ""by the numbers"" horror flick. The acting is decent for this type of film and the killer is pretty cool looking, but the killings are pretty mild for a slasher. It's worth a look for fans of slasher films, but it's pretty forgettable.",1269820800,4,688,4.468253968253968
3527695,4,B001D8W7J0,"The first 15 minutes of film may lead you to think Midnight Movie is one of the cheesiest horror flicks imaginable, but stick with it and be absolutely *amazed* that the quality of the storyline, the acting, and actual scares actually go *up* considerably.

Not just a little bit either- this movie improves drastically as it goes on.

There's something unique about the storyline, and let me mention what it is.

Most of the film takes place inside a movie theater, and while these teenagers are sitting in the theater and watching a horror movie of their own, what they see on screen turns out to actually be REAL deaths involving real people they know.

To me, this is a pretty original story for a horror film in this day and age.  It actually puts an interesting spin on the ol' ""teens die one by one"" formula we've seen for over 30 years now.

Of course once the teens figure out real people are actually dying and it's no movie they're watching, they quickly grow concerned for their own lives.

What's REALLY confusing -and something I never quite understood- is what exactly the bad guy is supposed to be.  Is it a real man with a history of violence?  Is he actually some kind of ghost or demon?  Is he some kind of Jason from Friday the 13th ripoff?  Ok, I'm kidding about that last one :)

There doesn't seem to be any indication he's a violent demon of some kind, so when it was revealed he could have been something other than a violent man going on a killing spree (by way of a police officer unable to see through the front doors of the movie theater, and therefore unable to see the teens on the other side begging and banging on the doors for immediate help) it COMPLETELY threw me off.  I still don't quite get what the bad guy is supposed to be.

This movie is incredibly graphic.  Lots of blood, and lots of violent ways for the teens to... die.  I won't spoil the storyline so keep watching for an interesting spin at the very end.

I love this movie despite the first 15 minutes of horrible acting.  Once you get to know the characters, the film may seriously win you over and get you to change your mind and your initial feelings on it.",1269734400,,2160,4.370927318295739

What follows defies logic, as the masked killer from the movie somehow comes to life, and begins ripping out chunks of flesh from those trapped inside the theater.

The killer is Ted Radford, who wrote and starred in 'The Dark Beneath', a seventy's style, black and white, slasher flick.  The movie's plot is basic, as a group of four young travelers is stranded by car trouble, and encounter some psycho killers when seeking help at a nearby house.  Apparently Radford took his role too seriously, and was sent to a mental institution, where a massacre occurred shortly after a showing of his film.  Radford is presumed dead, but Detective Barrons (Jon Briddell) has his doubts.

Jumping ahead five years, it's a slow night at a small Avenue Theater, and just a few customers are in the house for a midnight showing of The Dark Beneath.  Among them are Barrons, a biker named Harley (Stan Ellsworth), his girlfriend Babe (Melissa Steach), the theater manager Bridget (Rebekah Brandes), her boyfriend Josh (Daniel Bonjour), and some of her friends are also present.  While the movie is playing, the picture transitions to a shot of one of employees being gutted by the masked killer from the movie, then switches to a shot of the victim's body being dragged by the killer, down a hallway and through a door at the end.  This process repeats as each victim is slain, but it takes a while before the viewers realize that what they are seeing is real, and that the onscreen killer has come to life.  Bridget's younger brother Timmy (Justin Baric), who has sneaked into the theater, is also among those now trapped inside, as none of the doors to the theater will open, and phones do not operate.

Director Jack Messitt's film had a 22 day shooting schedule, and it moves at a brisk pace, once it gets going.  The number of victims being dragged down the hall, quickly grows, as Radford puts his deadly tool to use.  There is no way to make rational sense out of what is happening, so you need to just go with it and see where it takes you.

3527710,4,B001D8W7J0,"Around 12:30 am last night after the Late Night Show Sid cruised the channels in hopes of some fine b. Luckily one of the movie channels just started their showing of Midnight Movie. Previously we had read reviews in favor of the film and decided this would be the feature film of the evening. It offered up a nice concept for horror making it a somewhat original b. Sure it's nothing you must see, but for an avid low budget horror fan it's certainly worth the watch.

The film is centered around a group of people gathered at a dive movie theater to view a cult film called The Dark Beneath. Once the film starts rolling in becomes evident that the crowd of ten is in danger as the killer emerges from the screen taking people out one by one. To sum up the killer, he's a far less scary version of Leatherface who dons a corkscrew as his weapon of choice. The way he kills you is by smelling your fear, much like a bee, causing him to stalk you in a very slow foot dragging motion (hence the Leatherface comparison).

All in all the flick was pretty cool with a nice concept. We loved the idea of a killer popping out of the screen, killing his prey, then dragging them back into the movie for storage. However for it to be well received you should be pretty open to weak acting and lack of scares because it's far from frightening. It's more of that good low budget horror that provides more laughs then anything else, which is always a Sid favorite. This one probably would have been enjoyed years ago, but the lack of nudity may have scared a young elf off.",1251158400,5,1562,4.309523809523809

Midnight Movie doesn't take itself very seriously, but there is some thought behind the plot, fast pacing, and nifty resolve.  The budget is exremely low, and the film makers made the most with what they had.  Except for the fairly unlikable kid, the actors are decent, and some of the dialogue fairly amusing.  The bad guy looked creepy, and there was some decent bloody slasher action.

The regular version in Australia can be found amongst the budget DVD displays in stores that aren't known for being DVD retailers, such as dollar stores, chemists and places like this.  The full retail price is $2, and competes against mostly other straight to DVD low budget movies that you've likely never heard of, as well as made for TV movies.  So knowing that going in I didn't really expect this to be on par with the big movie studio horror films and I rate it accordingly against those that you find in the budget display rack.  At times Midnight Movie certainly has it faults, such as the script he has to act from and the acting of the biker, especially the initial entering the cinema and getting annoyed with anyone talking parts.  None of the actors are recognisable from anything else (and this came out in 2008, so nine years ago).  The interactions between the cool guys and the social loser guy also was a bit average. The black and white old film that the audience has come to see, also didn't look at all like an old film, it looked like some Saturday morning kids aimed show's cast of modern day actors doing a horror movie skit and trying to act like hippies. The bad guy himself looked kind of cool but the brown chin mask thing, looked like a mask, I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a burnt or deformed jaw, but it looked pretty fake.  The police characters were also a bit lame, and you'd think would have seen the original film and know straight away when it starts being different.

But the movie is a lot of fun.  You've got your characters such as the jerk that you want to see killed in a slasher horror movie, you've got plenty of attractive girls, you've got pretty much no hope of escape by conventional means so if any are to survive they're going to have to work out how.  The killer has his own unique weapon, a metal coil hand sized screw.

The movie only goes for 80 minutes and the ending is a bit weak.  The credits are slanted on a 45 degree angle, so go up from the bottom left towards the top right of your TV screen for some reason.  But if you come across this in stores or even online for around the $2 retail price, you definitely get value for your money.  Definitely more fun than The Last Action Hero if you're after a movie where the movie being played and the real world have characters crossing over into both.

8292298,5,B001D8W7J0,Good cheap horror movie,1468022400,,23,5.0
8292299,3,B001D8W7J0,This should be brief. to me there was not much new and exciting here. The ending is standard and typical and the acting was okay and not much more than that. The story of a crazed killer who made and movie and then when it is played later comes to life and kills the audience is also okay and mot much more. The weapon was new and nothing more than a glorified corkscrew. This is a movie that you can watch when there is virtually nothing else to do.,1468022400,,450,4.067415730337078

Seller sent in good packaging and timely!

Just like any horror movie, things go from bad to worse as our characters figure out whats going on. Skully appears and disappears at the drop of a hat which keeps the characters on their toes. As people are getting bumped off, they do try to get out of the theater but theres some sort of magic at play and none of the doors will open. They try and stop the film (which was a thought I had) but things don't quite work out like they planned. And as for the ending, things get really weird in a cool way!!",1460851200,,627,4.216666666666667
8292302,4,B001D8W7J0,"In my never-ending search for descent horror movies, sometimes I'll stumble across one that is quite intriguing. Midnight Movie is one of those. Here we have a corkscrew wielding killer wearing a creepy skull mask knocking off people trapped in an old theater. Even though it's lower budget, I never thought the effects were cheesy. Also, the actors weren't horrible. I found the cast to be likable. I can't say that the movie was scary, but definitely worth watching!",1458345600,,468,4.936708860759493
