7153764,4,B00WT9YTP2,"For what I paid, I can't believe I own all of the current Doctor Who DVD's! Still working my way through the series, but all of the discs in seasons 5-7 work perfectly.",1443312000,,168,4.121212121212121
7153765,5,B00WT9YTP2,"Disks are packaged a little strange, but everything works and the disks were perfect and clean!  10/10, can't beat it for the price!",1442534400,,132,4.739130434782608
7153766,5,B00WT9YTP2,Love love love this series was so happy when I found the complete series for as cheap as it was. It arrived every quickly which surprised me because they were telling me I would receive it in two weeks when in reality I got them in four days. Everything seems to work which isn't a surprise considering they look brand new for a used product. Can't say enough good things so happy with my purchase.,1441756800,2,398,4.32
7153767,5,B00WT9YTP2,Great price for all 8 seasons! Love the show and I'm happy I found it here.,1439942400,3,75,3.75
7153768,5,B00WT9YTP2,"Got all 8 seasons, I noticed some reviews said they were missing 8. Came in well packaged material and all new and sealed. Great buy.",1436832000,6,133,4.36
7153769,5,B00WT9YTP2,Great set- great series. So nice to watch on our schedule. Mushy sound is my only complaint about this set.,1435276800,2,107,4.4
7153770,5,B00WT9YTP2,"I can't say enough good things about this company that I bought Dr. Who from. The full eight season's came in perfect condition, and in only a few days. They may be used, but there isn't a scratch on any of them. This is the best TV show on BBC and I couldn't be happier with watching it over and over.",1434326400,9,302,3.9672131147540983
7153771,3,B00WT9YTP2,Contains seasons 1-7 and they seem to work well. Does not contain season 8. Still at under $150 for the first 7 seasons it is still a great deal. Should probably change picture /description to match what is in the package.,1431475200,7,222,4.439024390243903
7153772,4,B00WT9YTP2,"Awesome collection! However, beware that it does not include the 4th Series Specials: The Next Doctor,  Planet of the Dead, and The End of Time (Parts 1 & 2). It also does not include The Time of the Doctor, The Day of the Doctor (50th Anniversary), the entire 9th season or the 9th season special, The Husbands of River Song. I was able to buy them individually through Amazon for about and extra $100. Still a great deal for me.

I believe there is a collection that you can buy that does include the 9th season. However, it will also not include any of the additional episodes listed above. Including the Husbands of River Song. The complete 9th Season (including River episode) is scheduled to be released in May for $79. Currently cheaper to buy discs separately.",1458086400,,768,4.598540145985401
7153773,5,B00WT9YTP2,"Great value, but it is for zone 2. It plays just fine in our PS3.",1457740800,,65,3.4
7153774,2,B00WT9YTP2,"The first Four seasons that I received seem to be bootleg copies. I have emailed the sender but not gotten a reply.
I love Doctor who and would rate it highly.... if they were real versions.",1457568000,,190,4.305555555555555
7153775,5,B00WT9YTP2,"I have been a doctor who fan for a while - even went back to watch the old ones...  So my 5 stars is also for the seller here - these arrived well packaged and right on time, and the price was very good as well - thanks!  I would definitely buy from this seller again!!!",1457481600,,270,3.8035714285714284
7153776,4,B00WT9YTP2,"This was a gift for my birthday and I was so excited to get it. I mostly love it. The DVDs come individually wrapped in their boxes according to season and seem like they could be store-bought except that the discs themselves actually look strange.. They have some misspellings in the episode names but they're all there so far (I've only watched through season four at the time of rating), and the extras are there too.
The reason for the 4 stars is because they don't include all of David Tennent's episodes, which is apparently sold separately as ""Doctor Who Specials"".  So it's *almost* the complete series. It does seem to have all the Christmas specials and it was quite a bargain at the time of purchase.
All in all, I'm very happy with it and I will be saving up to purchase the DW Specials that it's missing.",1456704000,4,817,4.483221476510067
7153777,5,B00WT9YTP2,"Just received this set and I am BEYOND happy! I'm a huge Doctor Who fan, and finding a set that was affordable but still new was such a great deal. Couldn't be happier with the seller also. GREAT customer service. DVDs were all new and in perfect condition when arriving. Asked if the seller could ship them out sooner than they were expected and not only did he get them to me faster, but he threw in something a little extra for me too. A pleasure to buy from! Can't wait to re watch the whole set again! Thank you!!",1454976000,,518,4.19
7153778,5,B00WT9YTP2,Came in good condition as promised.  All the discs work well.  Great price for 8 seasons.,1454284800,,89,4.5
7153779,3,B00WT9YTP2,I bought this in September ok I now have gotten thru to season 8 my issues was until I got to season 6 the dvds skip freeze tried contacting the person that sold it to me thru ignored me the only ones that are good in my set is seasons 6 7 and 8 I am disappointed and I spend so much money and seasons 1 thru 5 don't even work properly and are badly scratch too bad amazon does not back up there sellers I feel like I wasted 140 dollars,1453852800,,436,3.75
7153780,5,B00WT9YTP2,"Contained all eight seasons, great buy for the money. Was an amazing gift, parents didn't know what to say!",1452729600,,107,4.684210526315789
7153781,5,B00WT9YTP2,"Who doesn't love Dr Who.  This complete set, minus the current season, is at a reasonable price when one considers the cost of buying each season separately.  Netflix will be letting this series go on Feb 1, 2016 so if you are counting on catching the series there it will be gone shortly.  That is why I made this investment.",1452297600,3,326,4.4
8714139,5,B00WT9YTP2,This purchase added to my fiance and i's dvd collection. We were really upset when netflix removed doctor who and we were in the middle of season 7. So we bought the first 8 seasons and have not had a single regret. we can now watch it whenever we want.,1528329600,,253,4.08
8714140,5,B00WT9YTP2,I ordered this for my mom to get her into Doctor Who and she loved it. The only problem is most of the Christmas specials are not included and you miss a lot when you don't watch those.,1469577600,,185,3.8947368421052633
8714141,5,B00WT9YTP2,Being able to watch the dvd's anytime is perfect !!  Doctor Who is so interesting to watch.  Well done !!!!!,1463097600,,108,4.35
8714142,1,B00WT9YTP2,"Love the doctor.  Hate whoever sold this.  Missing 8 episodes.  The next Doctor, planet of the dead, water of Mars, time of the doctor, day of the doctor, last Christmas, husband's of river song....all the specials that are missing.  Sold as ""complete"".  Received incomplete.  Not happy.",1463011200,,287,5.130434782608695
8714143,1,B00WT9YTP2,"If I could give this 0 stars I would.  I bought the whole series and when it came, only 1 series worked.  All of the DVDs were scratched up and unfixable.  I tried to get a different set by sending these back in but the seller rejected me.",1462924800,,239,3.9375
8714144,4,B00WT9YTP2,"If you're a Doctor Who fan, this is a great set to purchase as it includes seasons 1-8. It's basically the individual season sets that have been bundled to give a better deal. BBC has done a great job of including lots of great extras in the individual seasons, but this set doesn't have anything additional in it.

Unfortunately, if you want the complete series 1-8, you'll still need to purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Specials/dp/B008KHRODG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Complete Specials</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Day-of-the-Doctor-50th-Anniversary-Special/dp/B00FAVRFXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Day of the Doctor (50th Anniversary Special)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Time-of-the-Doctor/dp/B00HCK7THS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Time of the Doctor</a>.

Doctor Who: The Complete Specials wraps up David Tennet's time as the Doctor and introduces Matt Smith. Without this 5-disc set, you miss out on some very critical shows in the series.

The Day of the Doctor is the 50th Anniversary special that takes place at the end of season 7.

The Time of the Doctor is another critical episode that wraps up Matt Smith's time as the Doctor and introduces Peter Capaldi as the new Doctor.

In my opinion, without these sets/episodes being included, it's not really a complete season collection, but it was still a great deal as it allowed me to purchase the entire series at once for a great price. (Keep an eye of the prices as they fluctuate quite a bit over time.) At the time of writing this review, season 9 has also been released, so there may be a new set that includes season 9 as well.",1462924800,,1847,6.255905511811024
8714145,1,B00WT9YTP2,"IF YOU BUY THIS SET PLEASE NOTE IT IS NOT COMPLETE!!!
I purchased this set with great expectations. Wow have I been let down. I just finished series 4 only to discover that 4 episodes are missing including the regeneration to Matt Smith from what is supposed to be the complete set. Missing episodes are as follows: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, and The End of Time. Now I will have to go back and see if any other episodes are missing from the other 3 series I have already watched. When a set like this item says complete series I expect complete, not ALMOST complete or missing just a few episodes.
  Now I will have to try and locate these 4 and any others I discover are missing and purchase them separately to add to this collection. As much as I have been a Dr Who fan for 42 yrs. and very much enjoy the shows watched so far I cant give this more than a 1 star. I have no tolerance for being deceived or lied too about a product. The word complete says it all. This is not a complete set.",1462665600,,1023,4.11
8714146,5,B00WT9YTP2,Awesome purchase for my weekends,1461369600,,32,5.6
8714147,2,B00WT9YTP2,when I bought this I thought it was going to include every episode from each season. Unfortunately there are very important episodes missing that I had to buy in addition to this.,1459036800,,179,4.625
8714148,5,B00WT9YTP2,Absolutely perfect!!,1458172800,,20,9.5
