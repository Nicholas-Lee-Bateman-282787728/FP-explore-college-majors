5716154,5,B00CDEJRDC,"The TARDIS is moving through space, minding its own business, when it's nearly trapped by a giant web. It escapes (or does it?!) and the monitor shows that it has materialized in the dark somewhere. The Doctor and Jamie are ready to go out and explore. Victoria isn't so sure, ""Is it safe?""
The Doctor is quite chirpy in his reply: ""I shouldn't think so for a moment.""

They figure out that they're in the London Underground! Unfortunately, the tunnels are infested with the web fungus and robot Yeti.

What! The Doctor thought he'd deactivated all the Yeti at the end of ""The Abominable Snowmen"", 40 Earth years before. It turns out that Professor Travers has inadvertently reactivated one of the robots, allowing the Great Intelligence to attempt another invasion. It doesn't look good for planet Earth. Travers confidently tells Harold Chorley, a tabloid reporter: ""More than likely, we'll not be able to defeat this menace. And London, the whole of England, might be completely wiped out. <aside> Have you got that?""

This national catastrophe requires the army, and the Doctor meets Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart (before he becomes a Brigadier in UNIT), who asks,
""Tell me, Doctor. This Intelligence. Exactly what is it?""
Doctor: ""Well, I wish I could give you a precise answer. Perhaps the best way to describe it is a formless shapeless thing, floating about in space like a cloud of mystery, with a mind and will.""

How do you fight something you can't see?

""The Web of Fear"" was originally broadcast in February/March 1968. The series has 6 episodes of 17 minutes each. The Doctor first met it's villain, the Great Intelligence, in ""The Abominable Snowmen"" series (9/1967). POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: Thanks to the Doctor's well-intentioned companions, the Great Intelligence gets away at the end of ""The Web of Fear"". He'll be back in a big way in ""The Snowmen"" (2012 Christmas special) and ""The Bells of St. John"" and ""The Name of the Doctor"" (both Season 7, 2013).

This is a super Dr. Who series, a true sci-fi thriller with hidden homing devices and a mole in their midst. A little touch of melodrama, too! The B&W cinematography is very good - particularly in the beginning, where a Yeti awakes in a museum. I half expected Boris Karloff to walk out.

The video for all episodes except #3 has been recovered and digitally vidFIRE remastered for this DVD release. The show looks crisp and clean. The original audio is available for all 6 episodes and has been remastered.

Episode 3 is shown with the original soundtrack and telesnaps, still photos. This is the same as is currently available on itunes. However, the itunes videos of episodes 1,2,4,5 & 6 cannot be of vidFIRE quality, so the DVD should look better (I haven't ordered it on itunes).

youtube has a short interview with with the gray-haired Nicholas Courtney. Courtney explains that ""The Web of Fear"" was ""all set in the London underground. The sets are rather impressive, I think.... It was done in Lime Grove, and so carefully ... that London Transport rung up and said, 'How dare you film the London Underground without our permission.' ""

That the underground is a set is given away after the TARDIS first lands. For a time, there is no music, and as Jamie walks down the tunnel in his big boots, you can hear the distinct sound of his steps on plywood.

English subtitles are available. The only Bonus Extra is the trailer for the upcoming DVD release of ""Enemy of the World"". It's too bad they didn't at least add Production Notes to ""Web of Fear"".

[Note: I updated my review after receiving and reviewing the DVD.]

5716155,5,B00CDEJRDC,"On October 10, 2013, the BBC held an press conference in London announcing the recovery of the missing episodes of Enemy of the World and the Web of Fear (minus episode 3). Thanks Phil Morris! These were made available as downloads on iTunes with a recon and off air audio used for Web 3. The press conference was attended by Frazer Hines (Jamie) and Deborah Watling (Victoria) among others. The Web of Fear was sort of a follow up to the hugely popular The Abominable Snowman. It features the return of Professor Edward Travers and the introduction of Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart.

from tv shows on dvd:
""The TARDIS narrowly avoids becoming engulfed in a cobwebby substance in space. It arrives in the London Underground railway system, the tunnels of which are being overrun by the web and by the Great Intelligence's robot Yeti. The Intelligence's goal is to drain the Doctor's mind; can the Doctor sabotage the device before the Intelligence's plan comes to fruition?""",1389744000,12,979,4.933333333333334
5716156,4,B00CDEJRDC,"Bought this when I heard they found some missing episodes. A great story! It still stands up to a modern audience. I liked that the set pieces did look so convincing, even to today's standards. At the time this was broadcast, the London Underground sent a nasty letter to the BBC to complain that the BBC must have filmed on their property without permission. But it was all filmed in a studio, with a few street scenes and warehouse scenes typical of the time. The Yeti make their second appearance, after 'The Abominable Snowmen' and get a slight redesign. In 'The Abominable Snowmen' the Yeti are a bit cuddly. In 'Web of Fear' the Yeti now look more menacing.",1455408000,,663,4.579831932773109

5716158,5,B00CDEJRDC,"+5 stars for The Web of Fear. It is a classic story. Not only one of the best from the Patrick Troughton era, but one of the all time greats of Doctor Who.

+5 stars for the restoration. It is fantastic. +5 stars for the wonderful DVD release. The picture quality is much better on the DVD than what I saw on iTunes.

It has been reported by Phil Morris that episode 3 was found with the other episodes of The Web of Fear in Nigeria. Somebody apparently took episode 3 before the prints could be shipped back to the UK, depriving millions of Doctor Who fans from seeing this story in its entirety.

In 2012, when I heard all the missing episodes of The Web of Fear were finally discovered in Nigeria, I was overjoyed. I believed that I would finally be able to watch this complete story with my father after a forty year wait. But that was too much to hope for since somebody in Jos, Nigeria apparently has no honor or integrity. To steal the only remaining copy of episode 3 and depriving millions of fans who have waited decades to see this entire story is disgraceful.",1451520000,2,1071,4.318407960199005

5716165,5,B00CDEJRDC,"My favorite story with Patrick Troughton as the Doctor! (at least on complete, restored video)! 1st UNIT story and the introduction of Nicholas Courtney as Colonel (future Brigadier) Lethbridge-Stewart! Very suspenseful and atmospheric! The sets depicting the London Underground for it's time are very claustrophobic!  The restoration is beautiful as the DVD shows the VidFire technique.

It certainly lives up to it's reputation as one of the all-time best of the series and does a wonderful job highlighting Patrick Troughton's Doctor as well as giving us the first appearance of Nicholas Courtney's Lethbridge-Stewart character.

The only nagging issue I had with this story was after finally viewing ""The Moonbase"", which had two animated episodes, I wish they would have animated episode 3 of this one instead of using still photos to recreate the episode. Other than that, the story is great and it is fantastic to see these otherwise ""missing"" stories that would have probably remained missing if it wasn't for the episode recreations that are being done.",1427846400,,524,4.822222222222222

5716201,4,B00CDEJRDC,"Never before in the history of Doctor Who has this title been realeased.  And now in the 21st century we are given to the now clasic Patrick Troughton era Doctor Who epsidoes entitled ""Web of Fear"".  The Doctor, jaime and Victoria have survived the fight between the Doctor and Salamader and find themsevles in 20th century Earth.  What they don't know is that they will encounter thier old freind Professor Travers.  The very same man who thought he found the legendary Yeti only to discover an evil alien meance that intended to conquer the Earth from the moutains of Tibet.
  However they are in for many dangers as the Yeti are back and seem to be in control of the London underground and intend to conquer the city.  With a small group of soliders and Travers and his daughter to aid them the Doctor must figure out what thier plan is.  The Doctor also meets a man who will one day be a great freind to him COL Lethbridge-Stewart.  Can they save London or will the Great Intelligence along with the Yeti rule the Earth?
  With this rather short describtion of the episode itself I have to tell those looking that like the other release this has NOTHING.  All it has is a trail for Enemy of the World.  Again my disastifaction on the lack of extras for this is mind boggling.  Why would they do such a thing with this series?  The other fact that kills me is they didn't even try and animate the missing third episode.  Were they so rushed to put this out that they didn't want to even spend time on that?

Negatives: episodes not as clean looking as restorations (e.g. Tomb of the Cybermen), a very bare bones package with no extras---no commentaries, no documentaries, etc. They should really have taken the time to animate the missing episode (like they did with The Invasion). The wait and expense for a ""Special Edition"" would have been worth it.

5716212,4,B00CDEJRDC,"The Web of Fear is a wonderfully atmospheric Troughton era base-under-siege story, set in the London Underground and piled with soldiers and scientists. We see the return of old friends and enemies (Professor Travers and the Great Intelligence with its Robot Yeti servants, respectively) and meet the man who would go forward to become one of the Doctor's best friends and most frequent allies, military man Brigadier (still Colonel, here) Lethbridge-Stewart. It's at once a sequel to the tragically still-missing The Abominable Snowmen, a prequel to the U.N.I.T. era, and a great representation of the then-present Troughton era.

Nobody is above suspicion within the story as paranoia looms around every corner. Old friends may have hidden agendas, new allies are met with wary, and the Doctor and his companions are suspected of being up to no good themselves. The setting is claustrophobic and ominous, and the danger is never far away. A great mix of action and character focus take us through the six-parter, testing the team's resolve from all sides. It's fun and freaky, true Doctor Who.

The most recently discovered (that we know of) of the missing episodes is with us (along with other found companion&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Enemy-of-the-World/dp/B00IO998U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Enemy of the World</a>, but that's a separate matter), released to DVD to be appreciated again after 45 years. Tragically, episode 3 is still lost, but is here represented by the original surviving audio paired with relatively comprehensive telesnaps to keep the story together using as much of the original material as possible. It's a fair compromise to have the other five episodes (four of which had been lost) back in the public, and with their own DVD release.

The only thing that leaves me rating this four stars instead of five is the puzzling lack of bonus materials that tend to ooze from every pore of Classic Who DVD releases. In the several months between the immediate release of the missing episodes on iTunes and their final DVD release, one would think they could have tossed something else on there. With the episodes available digitally, I think fans would have been fine waiting a little longer for a DVD with more features, but what we got is essentially financial double-dipping, the same stuff as the digital release but on a disc (and with slightly more restoration). The ""production note subtitles"" that are on nearly all Classic Doctor Who DVDs are absent here. The starring companions are alive and well, but it seems no one thought to ask them to do a commentary, or even a quick interview where they could share their thoughts about seeing this work of theirs back after so long, particularly Deborah Watling, who previously had but one complete serial surviving. A short look at the history of the Robot Yeti and the Great Intelligence? A tribute to Nick Courtney as it's his first story as the character he was famous for? Something about how the episodes were found, tracked down on the other side of the globe? The answer is no. None of these seem to have been produced, and they certainly weren't included on the DVD. Perhaps a Special Edition release will come some day, loaded with features and yet another opportunity for the BBC to squeeze money out of something they thought they'd tossed out.",1401926400,,3412,5.1441441441441444
5716213,5,B00CDEJRDC,AWESOME to have this episode restored to the DOCTOR WHO library.  Never thought that any missing episodes would have been found after all these years.

In this one we saw Professor Travers once more which was nice and he played an even more important role in this story. Unfortunately this would be the last one we would see of him although he'd be mentioned in the later serial called THE INVASION. As a collector and as a fan of Patrick Troughton as the Doctor I just had to own this story as well and on DVD.

Because of the excitement to get it on the market this has no special features section like interviews or ""making of"" etc., but you don't miss it.  Seeing it, I felt as though I had seen it before in a British childhood I never actually had.  I do wish the episode where Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) made his first appearance in Doctor Who had survived intact as the rest of the episodes had, (that one episode has only the audio track and stills).  It was great seeing the second story featuring the Great Intelligence we saw in a more recent episode as well as the legendary Doctor Who Yeti in full mechanical motion.

Cons:  One of the six episodes that make up Web of Fear is missing.  Rather than create nicely done Flash animation (such as for The Invasion) the BBC chose to use photo stills and the audio.
Granted the photo stills + audio do a pretty decent job, but I can't help but wish they'd done animation instead and used the stills/audio as part of the extras.

Did I say extras?
Nix that.  No extras whatsoever on this.

the interest, even with the law of one episode missing and reconstructed from photo grabs and the audio soundtrack. To someone who knows the series or has read the novelizations, it is obvious that there may be a little bit of episode two missing near the end...but this doesn't detract from the story or the performances. The introduction of the 'classic series' character of Lethbridge Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) makes this an important entry in the recovered story.

My biggest complaint is that the BBC felt it wasn't necessary to put together any 'special features' for the dvd, just releasing the story. Period. A pity. Background information is always a lot of fun, especially to a Whovian.",1400803200,,826,5.073529411764706

A supporting player annoys.

This is not a criticism of the animated DVD's that have come out over the last couple years to allow us to see the lost episodes.  But I much prefer the tele-snaps being used to fill the void.  It just seems to be more true to the original missing story.  This s a fabulous Second Doctor story with a great Sci-Fi theme. The Yeti look lame but that was the way they did things on the classic series since they had thin budgets. This one introduces us to the Brigadier but it is too bad that Part 3 (where he makes his entrance) is the only missing story. Yet it is great to see him in the surviving stories. Still, his character makes an impact and it is easy to see why he was brought back during the 1970's. A pretty vanilla DVD but it is all about the stories right?

5716227,5,B00CDEJRDC,"I've always enjoyed this one and now it can be enjoyed visually as it was ment to be. For over 40 years only the first episode and a few clips were known to exist from this six-part adventure. Episode 1 was released on video tape in ""Doctor Who: The Troughton Years"" and as a bonus episode with the surviving clips on ""Doctor Who: The Reign of Terror"". The episode and clips were released on DVD in ""Doctor Who: Lost in Time - The Patrick Troughton Years"". The entire story was released on CD as an audio adventure. But now episodes 2 & 4-6 have been recovered. Episode 3 has been reconstructed using the surviving audio track and photographs. So now we can enjoy the entire story as it was ment to be enjoyed.

A sequel to the currently lost ""The Abominable Snowmen"", this classic adventure has the Doctor and his friends arriving in the London underground in the year 1970 to find London deserted and under marshal law. It isn't long before they learn why - the underground has been overrun by the Yeti (disguised robots sent to Earth by a monevelent alien force known as the Great Intelligence which also has the power to posses). The Doctor must join forces with Earth's local military under the command of Col. Lethbridge-Sewart (in his first appearance) in order to stop its evil plans.

More terrifying than the first Yeti story and even more action-packed with great performances, great sets, and some eerie lighting and music makes the recovery of this adventure a Whovian's dream come true.

5716228,5,B00CDEJRDC,"Outstanding to have this release.  I believe it has been digitally re-mastered the images are sharper than I would have believed possible. and the sound is amazing.  As usual I will skip the plotline as I am sure you have read it.

What you get on this release is one disc containing 6 episodes and no special features.  Though there are subtitles if you need them.

This is a reconstructed episode.  It is still missing episode three.  However using an audio recording and still pictures they convey the story very well.  I am sincerely glad they used the still pics over the animation they used in other re-constructions. It is less distracting from the story and while the stills don't always match the dialogue it is still a good release.

Onto the bad.  There are no special features as I mentioned.  I hope this is headed for a release as a special edition.  The finding of the missing episodes and the re-construction is a story I would love to see.

I have seen it mentioned that they should have held the production up until special features could be added.  I disagree.  For the lousy 20 bucks or so I paid for this I am not only happy to have it in hand I will be more than glad to shell out more of my hard earned cash when they do release the Special Edition.",1398816000,2,1272,4.3760683760683765

5716231,4,B00CDEJRDC,"Well, let's start with the good news first. A lost episode from the very poorly represented Troughton years is uncovered.
I remember watching episode 1 on the ""Lost In Time"" box set and being both intrigued and upset I was left hanging at
the end of the episode. It's a very strong story involving the Yeti/the Great Intellegence, all taking place in the abandoned London Underground, which is enough creepy in itself. Of the 6 episodes that make up this story, all but episode 3 has
been found & restored. The picture & sound quality are in line with past remasters. IMHO the London Underground sets
are only amplified by the black & white footage-not sure it would be as intiguing in color. There's a great use of shadows
and making the dark work for you.

On this particular disc, the BBC has opted not to use the past services of the animation team that has filled in the gaps
of past missing episodes. Honestly, I have to say I prefer this way. Since 5 of the 6 episodes exist, they were able to cull
enough stills to make it work.

The bad news is that we (I) have been accustomed to lots of DVD extras (actor interviews & the making of..., etc.) There
is nothing here. You get the story only-not that that's a bad thing. I just thought they could have waited a bit longer to
interview former Doctor companions Frazier & Deborah (Jamie & Victoria) and put together a ""making of"" segment.

Outside of that, I am very happy with the purchase and look forward to more missing episode discoveries poping up from
the basements & storage rooms of remote libraries & churches around the globe. Never give up the quest!",1398556800,27,1617,4.493197278911564

5716233,5,B00CDEJRDC,"As any fan of Doctor Who knows, this story (or at least 4/6 of it) was missing for decades and only recently were four of the lost episodes found in Africa.  When I first started watching Doctor Who in the 1980's this was one of the stories that I had most wanted to see.  Apart from being one of the two stories featuring the Yeti and the Great Intelligence (and may I say here, kudos to the current Doctor Who team for bringing the Great Intelligence back to face off against Matt Smith - and such fortuitous timing!), but it is also the first appearance of Brigadier (Colonel here) Lethbridge-Stewart.

Patrick Troughton is one of my favorite Doctors (sometimes my all time favorite depending on the day and my mood) and it is a shame that so much of his era has been lost.  Thanks to the recovery of lost episodes and the reconstructions of ones that are still missing we fortunately have more than we did back in the '80's.

The only thing that I wish they would have done to improve this DVD is to give it some special features.  Maybe a quick documentary about the recovery of the lost episodes (or even just the use of news footage reporting the discovery) and a commentary track.  I was at Chicago TARDIS in November and Frasier Hines said that he had not been approached about doing a commentary, but I was hopeful that the long delay of the US release of the DVD meant that they had been working on one.

5716237,5,B00CDEJRDC,"DVD arrived today and just finished watching it (US region 1  DVD release).

When I was first introduced to Doctor Who way back in the days of top-loading VCRs, I got to see quite a few Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker stories, thanks to a friend with family in England.  Mostly, I read the Traget books line of novels, and I really enjoyed the Troughton era stories, and hoped I'd someday get to actually see them.  This is one of the stories I wanted most to see, and it has lived up to my expectations.

As you probably already know, one episode was reconstructed from the sound track, using still photos.

A bit of a slow starter, but a lot of fun, with continual guessing about who might be betraying the humans.

DVD ran well.  Sound and picture were good.  No extras on this DVD - which is too bad, because the story of the recovery and restoration of these episodes would have made a great extra.  Maybe we'll get something like that on ""Enemy of the World"" when it comes out next month.

This is one of the best Troughton stories on DVD so far.

Now, if only the BBC can turn up some other ""lost episodes"" from this period.",1398124800,3,1125,4.279620853080568
5716238,5,B00CDEJRDC,"My earliest recollection of Dr. Who is William Hartnell's ""Planet of Giants from 1964. Man, that dates me... When I heard that this serial had been found, I danced for joy as, no doubt, so many others did. I wanted amongst other things to see how much I did recall from it. Not as much as I had thought, it seems, but that was no obstacle to my devoting 2.5 hours to watching it from start to finish.
It's a confusing start but that evens out once you realise that the Doctor and his companions have been thrust into a crisis, rather than be there at the start of the shenanigans.
And what delightful shenanigans they are too as the Yeti, formerly of Tibet, take to the London streets after bringing the Underground to a complete halt. The Underground sets are divine and word is that London Transport got a bit miffed with the Beeb because they thought they had stolen into the Underground after hours to film; they are beautifully lit and so wonderfully staged.
Everybody gets a chance in this story and characters that might otherwise have remained in the background are brought to the fore. Even the Doctor is absent from Part 2 and it's nice to see Jamie and Victoria less prominent. Jack Woolgar gets the honours here as Staff Arnold.
Sadly, there are no special features. I remarked to one UK reviewer that complained about this that, given the incredibly short time between discovery and release, he was lucky to get it at all but that is a comment that no longer holds any water. I would have been happy to wait until now to get something...alack, alas....We do have the notice that ""Enemy of the World"" is ""Now Available"" but not as ""Now Available"" as this piece. Oh well.
OK, so the Yeti look like the Wombles' poor relations and Victoria's gunny sack makes her look like a midget but nevertheless, it is truly delightful to watch and, Episode 3 notwithstanding, one for the record books. It really is good. The set piece with the Yeti slugging it out with UNIT in front of a sign that says ""Commit No Nuisance"" is a gem (I wonder if that was intentional humour?); there's a yet-to-be-promoted-to Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and, while we're on the subject, Sergeant Benton as a Yeti; and for the observant, the chocolate being handed out is ""Camfield's"" Dairy Milk.
And so the collection grows evermore complete but I have the sinking feeling that the Beeb will quietly shelve the classic Dr. Who reconstructions, given the stories circulating about ""The Underwater Menace."" Given, also, the haphazard and occasionally criminally inept animations of some of the stories, it wouldn't surprise me to know that I'm right. But that's for the future.
In the meantime, sit back and revel in some not only classic Dr. Who but classic television.

At the very least buying it will generate support and funds for the BBC and encourage them to search for more missing episodes! That being said this is a really good story!

It's really great to see more Patrick Troughton episodes, especially at his height in his run. It nice to see the Jamie/Victoria/Second Doctor team! They work well together.

To make a quick comment on the DVD itself, it arrived a little bit ago. The quality is what to expect from these well restored and VidFIREd Classic Who releases. And unlike the Moonbase R1 DVD this one is running at the correct speed and is completely interlaced for that lovely video look, ;)

A word of warning though, the main menu is not, xD As in when the disc finally reaches the menu don't let your heart sink like mine did when I heard dialogue rendered a pitch too low and no video look to be seen. The menus were probably a quick conversion.

But rest assured as -the main feature is VidFIREd and running at the right speed-!
Just ignore the menu on this disc like I will do from now on, xD",1398124800,5,823,4.19620253164557
5716241,4,B00CDEJRDC,"Once youve dived into the universe of Doctor Who far enough, there are few things that can surprise you. Many of the villains we know from the recent 2005 reboot had been introduced decade before, when the original series aired. Locations, themes, even solutions to deadly puzzles all ring familiar as you dip your toes into the classic episodes. Yet, that doesnt hold true one hundred percent of the time, and watching the remastered 'Doctor Who: Web of Fear', only recently brought back to life through the discovery of some missing footage, is certainly an exception.

The Tardis frozen in space covered by space cobwebs. Yep, check and mate. Never seen that before.

'Web of Fear' originated in the years of the second Doctor, Patrick Troughton. Originally broadcast in early 1968, the story surrounds The Doctor and his traveling companions as they are lured down to Earth, and into the subway tunnels of London. When they arrive, the entire city of London has been evacuated due to a scourge of robot Yeti creatures, an unknown fog, and a living fungus currently filling up the underground tunnels. The Doctor finds assistance from a band of soldiers, a long lost friend and the initial appearance of Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart (the head of UNIT), in his battle against the Yeti and their master, The Great Intelligence.

For the newbies out there yet to delve into these older episodes, The Great Intelligence was played much later in the Matt Smith years by Richard E. Grant (introduced in the episode with the deadly ghost coming out of the frozen pond). Here, the classic villain is mainly out of sight until the later chapters where he appears only in the bodies of borrowed people or soldiers.

The story is important to the Doctor Who canon due to the introduction of Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT (which isn't actually mentioned outright during the episode). The same actor, Nicholas Courtney, will return in later years playing the same character, now promoted to Brigadier. His no nonsense, painfully logical, yet subtly caring demeanor is truly fun to watch.

Although most of the footage was unearthed, and able to be digitized and remastered, the third episode in the series only exists via still photos and audio tracks. So what you see on the screen during that portion is really only a slideshow of stills. The effect is a little like watching a old time radio play just translated to TV. As with many of the older Doctor Who episodes, there are some hilariously archaic special effects. The deadly fungus that fills the tunnels looks like sudsy overflow from your washing machine and the terrifying Yeti monsters are slow, bulky, and look like they grew up on the other side of Sesame Street. Nevertheless, the triumph here is none of that takes away from the drama, excitement and fun of the show. Some might say it actually adds to it, if you're one who loves older cinema.

One of the other characters that deserves special mention is Professor Travers (Jack Watling). He is a fantastically amazing curmudgeon, a sort of human representation of the battle between science and the rest of the world. He also opens up the long held debate about the responsibility of scientists to understand the ramifications of their constant tinkering with nature.

Another memorable note was the ending, which I won't give away fully, but The Doctor has a chance to not only defeat The Great Intelligence, but rid the universe of him for good. When that plan goes awry, Troughton lets us see a glimpse of the deep anger and frustration The Doctor can have with those around him. They don't understand the universe like he does, the action/reaction chain that he has followed his entire existence. We see a brief moment of how lonely it can really be to be the only truly smart person in the room.

'Doctor Who: The Web of Fear' is a worthwhile classic episode for the collector and not a bad one for the recently initiated either.",1398124800,10,3939,4.833827893175074
5716242,4,B00CDEJRDC,"I've been hoping they would find this ever since i first heard it on audio. Yet another classis Pat Troughton episode, close to one of his best. Which features the soon to be Bridadier (only a colonel in this ep) also brings back the Great Intelligence and the Yeti, which is accidentally summoned by a curator that Prof Travers (from the Abominable Snowmen) sold a intact Yeti too.
After being held in space for a while the three travellers return to Earth only to find it threatened (again). Its kind of a who dunnit as you try to guess WHO the Great Intelligence has been possessing.
I guess the only downside(if there is one, is that the missing eps aren't animated, only have photsnaps w/the audio. Maybe they're re-release w/animation like they did with The Ice Warriors.

It also features the yeti, one of the icon classic monsters of the show, despite only appearing in two stories, and the Great Intelligence, a villain who has recently returned to Doctor Who in the past year, facing off against Matt Smith's Doctor.

And yet I'm only giving it 4 stars as while the story is (IMO) Doctor Who's best, the DVD release is somewhat lacking. First off episode 3 is still missing and is presented by a telesnap (TV screenshots) reconstrution instead of animation as was the case with the other incomplete releases.  Also noticeable is the absolute lack of special features present, save for a trailer for the other recently recovered story, The Enemy of the World.

I'm suspicious that after this DVD has it's run, a ""Special Edition"" will appear that contains normal special features.

If the DVD comes out with some set of features, including Production Notes, I'll change my rating to 5-star.  I have the novelization of this book, but I've never seen the show; I'd very much like to see it, but I don't want to buy it twice.

Update: My order arrived Tue, 22 Apr, and I finished watching this six-parter Thu night.  Part 3 is audio-only, fillid in with still pictures, with one bit of notes when the action isn't clear from the audio.  It is the part that introduces ""Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart"".  The tension of ""someone here is working with the enemy, but we don't know who"" came across very well.

Lethbridge-Stewart makes his debut here and as any classic series fan knows The Brig was just as great a character and Nicholas Courtney as great as any actor who portrayed The Doctor himself.
Here he is introduced as a Colonel, but soon he would be The Brigadier, the only reason I'm giving this DVD release 4 stars out of 5 is because of the missing episode and it's the episode that actually introduces Stewart himself!!!
Oh, well at least it's preserved in photosnaps and complete audio which work very well in this case to forward the story. Troughten is one of my favorite Doctors and if you're a Who fan but haven't discovered the first two Doctors yet go out and get as many of both as you can while the prices are still good and the DVD's are still in print because they are going fast!!!
There very few 2nd Doctor DVD's available as complete stories which are: Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The Dominators, The Krotons, The Seeds of Death, The Enemy of the World and The War Games.
Of which personally I like Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The Krotons and The War Games the best and The War Games is now out of print and overpriced... I was lucky to get my copy through Buybacks for a somewhat reasonable $40.00 including shipping but still quite a lot for one story of one show where many full seasons of shows are available for less!!!
I have not seen The Invasion or The Ice Warriors but I with watching The Web of Fear online I am warming up to the DVD's that do have missing segments although it's still a crime that they haven't been able to recover those that were lost to time...

Still I highly recommend snapping up the stories from the first two Doctors as soon as you can because they seem to be going out of print faster and you'll regret getting the latter Doctors first.
My fav full Hartnell stories available on DVD are An Unearthly Child, The Daleks, The Aztecs, Planet of Giants, The Romans, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Space Museum and The War Machines. Which I highly recommend all of those, and every one is just as great a story as any of the later Doctors or new series episodes... especially The Aztecs, The Romans, Planet of Giants and The War Machines.
Personally as for Troughten I recommend The Mind Robber and Tomb of the Cybermen first to get a feel for his style and then the rest as you can get them, not to mention The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors and if you can get ahold of it for a nice price The Two Doctors which is really the only Colin Baker story worth anything in my opinion. I'm glad I got mine because it's going for crazy money on here and there are certain key stories if you are a true Doctor Who fan and as with those the introduction of The Brigadier I would certainly categorize as being 'key'.
Thanks for reading.
By the way I am just re-editing my review and adding that Web of Feat showcased The Brig's first appearance admirable but I believe his last appearance in Doctor Who officially is in the Sylvester McCoy episode 'Battlefield' which is another of course overpriced DVD currently. If you are truly interested in snapping up William Hartnell (1st Doctor) and Patrick Troughten (2nd Doctor) stories go to the WBShop where currently they have on sale some select DVD's from different Doctors and two of which are The Gunfighters from the 1st Doctor for $16.99 and The War Games from the 2nd Doctor for only $35.99!!! Seriousl, you can't find The War Games for that price ANYWHERE ELSE and it's really worth it. I may end up buying a second copy for myself as on Amazon, eBay and Barnes&Noble it's going for over a hundred easily. Same with The Gunfighters, Planet of the Spider (3rd Doctor), Frontios (5th Doctor), Time-Flight (5th Doctor) they are all on sale RIGHT NOW at the WBShop! I got mine right away as these are already out of print. I guess WB found some extra ones but they won't last long... The War Games is well worth it, it's nearly four hours long, 10 segments all complete and the 2nd Doctor's swan song (he regenerates) at the end of the story. It's also farewell for Jamie and Zoe his steadfast companions. And def worth the $35.00 price tag. It's an incredible story and as much as I loved The Web of Fear, The War Games outshines it so go get it!!!!  :)",1392076800,4,4505,4.413461538461538

However, it was a good story of the Doctor fighting an evil alien.  Also, the ending, where the Doctor's grand plan is defeated by one of his well-meaning but stupid associates was a great twist.  Also, a great introduction to one who would be a recurring character, Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart.",1463443200,,427,4.64

8580509,5,B00CDEJRDC,"The Web of Fear is a true classic Patrick Troughton story. Rediscovered in 2013, The Web of Fear follows the Doctor (Patrick Troughton), Jamie (Frazer Hines), and Victoria (Deborah Watling) in the London Underground battling the Yeti, controlled by The Great Intelligence. The effects are quite nice for the day, and the acting is superb. Unfortunately, Episode 3 three does not exist in the BBC Archives, to make up for this Episode 3 is reconstructed using audio and photos. This story takes place 40 years after The Abominable Snowmen, a story earlier this season. Amazing story!
