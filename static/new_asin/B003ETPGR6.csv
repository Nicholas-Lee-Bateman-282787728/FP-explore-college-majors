8395627,5,B003ETPGR6,The Basic Techniques for Working with Steel (DVD) came on time for Christmas gift and is what the recipient had asked for.,1357689600,,122,4.590909090909091
8395628,3,B003ETPGR6,"This video is a bit outdated considering the price. It would be a good deal for around 20 dollars. The quality of the video is poor. It looks like it was shot in the late 80's to early 90's but it's good enough that it gets the point across. The instructions and techniques that Ron uses in the video are excellent and anybody wanting to get better at sheet metal finish would probably benefit from watching this. It's a good video if you really want to learn but don't buy it thinking that your going to be entertained. This isn't the oc chopper drama crap, its pure instruction from a guy that really know his stuff.",1348704000,5,618,4.336206896551724
