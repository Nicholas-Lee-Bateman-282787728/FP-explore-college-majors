1366527,5,B00004WIBR,"Sitting alone one night watching HBO, I came upon this film, and  was  really impressed by it. The characters are very emotional, and the setting  (Budapest, Hungary) is in a place which is one of my favorite regions in  the world. The story starts out very dark and vividly and doesn't lose it's  grip thru the suprising climax, and if in were made in by Hollywood,  instead of being regarded in the Canadian film industry it would have gain  some more recognition, I highly recommend this thriller, it surely has  become one of my favorite movies.",969235200,8,549,4.645833333333333
1366528,2,B00004WIBR,"This movie is for the ones who like ""any"" kind of horror movies. I could not find anything special in it except for visual effects in some scenes. I call it an average horror movie as it does not have a value added  but just makes you spend some spare time. There is too much blood in the  flick and some instant moves make it rated R for viewers below 18 (and  persons with heart problems)",961027200,,390,4.105263157894737
1366529,4,B00004WIBR,"This movie was an amazing journey that really shows how well it was made.  I really loved the acting and the plot. Taking place in Budapest, a young  American becomes intrigued by the dark psyche that stalks the atmosphere  which he eventually becomes obseessed with, and in that finds a diturbed  young woman who becomes a dark part of his everlasting nightmare he lives  in.",960768000,3,376,4.723076923076923

7925759,3,B00004WIBR,It starts off with some promise but then gets worse rather than better. The situations and actions of the characters just are not logical. By the end it feels like a made for TV movie.,1515888000,,184,4.285714285714286
7925760,3,B00004WIBR,"It was OK. The lead chick was good for this role. Sexy as hell, too.",1509840000,,68,3.6
7925761,2,B00004WIBR,"Foreigners butchering the English language is quite annoying....
However, I always enjoy viewing STRONG FEMALE PROTAGONISTS.
Also....Acting was not terrible.",1509321600,,157,6.9
7925762,2,B00004WIBR,"Can't believe I watched this, but was pulled in by the reviews. This film was slowly but surely a let down scene by scene. Parts were ok, but nothing sensibly tied together, in the end either. It's like some scenes we're copied from other movies, it made no sense. Next movie I choose sure to be better. Oh well.",1508544000,3,312,4.305084745762712
7925763,5,B00004WIBR,"Riveting and captivating throughout the entire movie. I was hooked and drawn in by unpredictable characters that you can't take your eyes off of.. The tension keeps growing until you wish you could figure it out, but you can't!! This is one of my Top 5 movies of the Year, and I watch TONS of movies!!",1507939200,,301,4.392857142857143
7925764,1,B00004WIBR,"I rented this movie because it had Jurgen Prochnow in it, but they wasted a fine actor. The whole movie is a waste. This is a low budget, poorly written and acted supposed thriller. There aren't too many thrills, but a lot of bad dialog, contrived situations and a lead character that does one stupid, implausible thing after another.",1107129600,,334,4.677966101694915
7925765,5,B00004WIBR,"I feel like this film just ultimately sums up what it means to visually write poetry.  Ultimately, this film hooked me because of the skillfully crafted combination of spoken poetry over a deeply rooted issue...the issue being love.  Anyone who views this film will be astonished by the amazing feeling they recieve upon completion.  There are some rather explicit sequences, however, thankfully to my requirements, they are purposeful, and actually belong.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this film immediately!!!",1069718400,,514,5.308641975308642
7925766,5,B00004WIBR,"I'm a huge fan of Eric Shaeffer's work, but I did not know this film exsisted till an airing on the sundance channel a few months ago and I have to say this is the most true to form film about love and loss that I have seen to date.  Anyone looking for a film that challenges their perceptions of what love can be, what it really is, or what hope does to the restless...this is the film for you...",1054512000,,397,3.9625
7925767,5,B00004WIBR,"This film has become one of my all time favorite movies.
Ed Sheffer is unbelievable. I've seen the film several times, everytime it's on tv, I have to watch. Mr. Sheffer who wrote, directed and starred in the movie, has written one of the sexiest, and poetic scripts ever! This movie was GROSSLY OVERLOOKED! I cannot wait for this man's next film!
Excellent editing as well. I have to have this film in my collection and turn friends on to it. Definitely a must have.
