7885003,5,6305015104,My favorite Stone Cold Steve Austin VHS/DVD. Way better than 'Cause Stone Cold said so' . I owned this as a kid and I lost my copy back in the day. I am now 25 and had to buy it again. Its a classic.,1421539200,,199,3.5454545454545454

7885006,5,6305015104,"Where do you really start with someone like Steve Austin?
This tape is just another part of my Stone Cold Steve Austin collection. Since his departure from WWE a giant void is now present. Their top 5 performers combined can't match what Austin created each time he entered an arena. Everything he did he did with ""in your face attitude"". Whether he's battling the McMahons' or face-to-face with Mike Tyson, he brought excitement to each confrontation.
 I've seen people in the nose-bleed section jumping up when Austin entered a ring. Now you have people in front row seats checking their watch.
He truly deserves every accolade from each wrestler he faced.",1321315200,,658,4.927927927927928
7885007,5,6305015104,"This is the second tape WWE released on their hottest property at the time in Stone Cold Steve Austin.  This was different than ""Cause Stone Cold Said So"" in that this is an interview between Austin & Jim Ross along with highlights of his various feuds & moments from his chase to the WWE Championship and the name of the tape implies what to expect from this tape, Austin is uncensored & doesn't hold back when it comes to his language.

The video begins talking about his neck injury suffered at SummerSlam 1997 via the piledriver from Owen Hart & how Austin fought back from the injury.  Austin attacking the various participants in the match weeks leading up to the event was shown next before highlighting his performance & victory in the match itself before going into the historical confrontation with Mike Tyson the next night on RAW.  Austin's road to WrestleMania was chronicled next showing his confrontations with Shawn Michaels, stunning Chyna at No Way Out, and Tyson joining DX before seeing highlights of his victory over Michaels, the aftermath between Michaels & Tyson, and the post-event press conference.  After briefly talking about the meaning of his ""B.M.F."" walk, they go into the issues he had with Vince McMahon as WWE Champion & his match against Dude Love at Unforgiven before ending the tape talking about his relationship with the fans.

Although there aren't any complete matches on here, this was a tape that still stands the test of time today in showcasing Austin's road to his first WWE Championship via highlights of footage & his interview with Jim Ross & I have to recommend for any fan of Steve Austin or WWE's Attitude Era.",1302134400,2,1663,4.7972027972027975
7885008,4,6305015104,"The profanity in this video isn't as bad as you might expect.
Austin does say the F word a couple of times. He does flip birds a lot in this video but other than that, this video is pretty tight. It does have plenty of swearing in it but no more than you see on Monday night Raw. You'll see Austin opening up a can of whoop-... on everyone that gets in his way including: Mike Tyson, Vince McMahon, DX, Dude Love, and few others. If you love Stone Cold Steve Austin and have never seen this video, then you might need to check it out. It's pretty good entertainment. Oh, hell, yeah!!!!",1035590400,4,585,4.185840707964601
7885009,5,6305015104,"This is an awesome tape for anyone who loves the Rattlesnake!  I admit I just started watching pro wrestling again in 1999.  I liked what I saw of Stone Cold on Raw and so rented this tape to get to know him better.  Now I  am in love!  This gives you a good look at his recent career and you see  where all that WWF attitude comes from.  If you love Stone Cold, BUY  IT!",953596800,,371,3.8533333333333335
