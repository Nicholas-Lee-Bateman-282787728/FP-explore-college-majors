8745644,3,B019PC8FMS,"Long before one company decided to make a ""divas revolution"", TNA has been revolutionary in their own right for showcasing woman's wrestling on national television for close to a decade as the ""TNA Knockouts.""  It should be noted that despite TNA advertising this as Volume 2 of this series with the first set coming out before there was an actual division, there was another DVD released dedicated to the Knockouts in 2008 (Knocked Out - Pro Wrestling's Best Women's Division) meaning there was close to a decade of unreleased matches & moments that could have been used but TNA decided to focus on the more recent roster with a few exceptions with the bonus materials including a look at the knockout photo shoots & episodes of the TNA Digital Originals ""Knockouts Workout"" & ""My First Day"" featuring the knockouts.

Matches Include:
Steel Cage Match: Mickie James vs. Tara - Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne made it clear to Mickie James that she had to go through Tara in order to get to her with these two having a series of physical encounters leading to this final encounter with the fight starting outside the cage before the bell with these knockouts taking the fight to each other including sacrificing themselves to hurt the other or using the cage to throw their opponent into on more than one occasion along with one woman making a highlight reel moment of her own as this another physical encounter to the point where one knockout didn't leave without injury.
""Impact"" Dec. '10

Elimination Match: Knockouts Champion Tara vs. Ms. Tessmacher vs. Velvet Sky vs. Gail Kim - Knockouts Authority Brooke Hogan was at ringside as this was every woman for herself with some moments such as each knockout was attempting to steal a pin from another, one girl delivering a bulldog to another on the floor, and one knockout being distracted with issues she was having with another legal participant in the match in a non-stop action match.
""Impact"" Feb. '13

O.D.B. vs. Brittany vs. Angelina Love vs. Gail Kim - Angelina Love had her Beautiful People partner Velvet Sky at ringside in this #1 contenders match with the winner receiving a Knockouts Title match against Madison Rayne at the upcoming Sacrifice PPV with this match telling various stories such as alliances being formed & what caused them to be short lived along, certain knockouts being able to dominate over one or more knockout at the same time, and one knockout getting involved in this match to be the difference maker in a quick match.
""Impact"" Apr. '14

Steel Cage Match: Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim - Gail started off attempting to escape whenever possible only to keep letting stopped by Madison as both girls traded momentum using the cage to their advantage driving each other's head & body into the cage on more than one occasion while each girl continued to take risk that didn't pay off including crashing & burning full speed into the cage while going aerial at one point or another. Both girl worked hard here with some unique cage spots with Taz saying it perfectly, ""how tough are these girls?""
Lockdown '14

Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love - Madison started out in control with a series of armdrags sending Angelina to the outside followed by a baseball slide to outside but Angelina was able to regain control using the ropes to her advantage along with going to the outside whenever Madison started to gain control only for Madison to take it the outside as they traded momentum with Velvet Sky getting involved from the outside whenever possible. This match served it's purpose as far as re-establishing The Beautiful People but was just average at best as they never left first gear.
Sacrifice '14

Knockouts Champion Angelina Love vs. Gail Kim - Gail started out in control being able to trip Love with her own body & deliver a low running forearm while Love was able to counter Gail's offense into an impactful powerbomb allowing her to heavily work over the back area with the match briefly taken to the outside before one woman heavily gained a series of offense in a match that was good for what it was but was more about the story involving the ""other"" legal participants in the match that worked for & against both women at different times in the match.
Slammiversary '14

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love vs. Brittany - Velvet Sky was at ringside in Angelina Love's corner with one knockout having such a personal issue with another participant that she didn't even wait for the match to start telling different stories throughout the match such as alliances formed & the action not staying inside the ring with knockouts exchanging some impactful offense in a solid match.
""Impact"" July '14

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Taryn Terrell vs. Angelina Love vs. Velvet Sky - Love & Sky were members of the Beautiful People despite being opponents which played an important factor here as they worked together as a team throughout the match which also worked against them with their opponents using them against each other & how their teamwork came into play when the opportunity came to win the match in another solid encounter.
""Impact"" Aug. '14

Ladder Match: Taryn Terrell vs. Brooke vs. Gail Kim vs. Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love - You knew the direction this match was going when all the knockouts started brawling on the floor going for the ladders on the outside right away as this match had highlights such as one knockout suplexed onto the ladder, a ladder dropkicked against two opponents, one having her face driven into the ladder repeatedly, Gail Kim executing one of her signature moves though the ladder, one knockout getting kicked off the apron onto a scaffold ladder while another was locked inside an open ladder as I can't remember seeing a multi-knockout ladder match before in TNA so this was a good match.
One Night Only: X-Division Xtravaganza '15

Knockouts Champion Taryn Terrell vs. Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - Kong started out so dominate using one knockout as a weapon against the other taking out both at once causing her opponents to use different strategies such as forming an alliance & going aerial on more than one occasion with the winner ultimately being the one who was able to quickly catch the other by surprise.
""Impact"" Mar. '15

Gail Kim vs. Brooke vs. Angelina Love vs. Madison Rayne - This started off as a four way brawl on the floor with one knockout not waiting for her entrance to start the action as this match saw various moments such as offense executed by one having a domino effect on her other opponents, short lived alliances formed before it became every knockout for herself, the strategy of divide & conquer being played out, a sequence of moves leading to three submissions at one time, knockouts having the same idea for the same move at the same time leading to a ""crash & burn"", and the knockouts going aerial on more than one occasion.
""Impact"" Apr. '15

Brooke & Awesome Kong vs. Dollhouse (Marti Belle & Jade) - Dollhouse leader Taryn Terrell was at ringside with Brooke & Kong having to win this match in order to earn a title shot as the Dollhouse attempting to get a bigger numbers advantage before the match with Taryn making her presence known on the outside more than once with Dollhouse attempting to ""divide & conquer"" singling out one of their opponents & wearing her down by any means with this match having a finish that would look very familiar to old school wrestling fans.
""Impact"" June '15

Steel Cage Match: Gail Kim vs. Dollhouse (Marti Belle & Jade) - Gail Kim was out for revenge for breaking her finger & disrespecting her family weeks earlier with Dollhouse using their numbers & dirty tactics to their advantage while Gail used the cage as a weapon showing the mentality that she was more focused on revenge than winning.
""Impact"" Aug. '15

Beautiful People (Velvet Sky & Madison Rayne) vs. Dollhouse (Marti Belle, Jade, Rebel) - This was the in-ring reunion of The Beautiful People in a handicap match due to Love being injured in a previous attack with the fight starting on the floor with the numbers advantage constantly in the favor of the Dollhouse using whatever tactics possible causing Beautiful People to fight from behind attempting to fight from behind taking on each member individually.
""Impact"" Sept. '15

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - Another rivalry renewed that started at this same event close to 8 years ago with Kong being dominate with her size & power always staying a step ahead including using a grounded submission while Gail attempted to use offense from all different angles as the match started to get more physical with both women coming off the ropes & on the outside including chairs getting involved causing a verbal confrontation with someone in the audience who took what was happening personally in a solid match but not the high quality of their previous encounters.
Bound For Glory '15

A few of the criticisms here are that as I stated earlier that this set has a heavy focus on the more recent encounters regarding the knockouts which means that many previous encounters & moments of much higher quality that has happened in the past few years with knockouts still on their roster (as of when his project was completed) was omitted, where's Havok when he was the champion for months in recent times, a majority of matches on here were multi-woman matches which all started to look similar instead of selecting better quality matches from other events (only one One Night Only match & none from their own Knockouts Knockdown events?), and the biggest one is that there is no excuse in my mind for not having a Gail Kim vs. Taryn Terrell match (one on one from ONO: Rivals, Ladder & Cage matches from Impact) specifically their Last Woman Standing match from Slammiversary '13 which got the most non-wrestling media coverage for a woman's match in years that didn't involve a celebrity or reality show.  In the end, this was a solid release but it's very similar to what I've stated on more of their recent DVD releases that they didn't put the best effort possible so I would get this if your a fan of the knockouts.",1453075200,2,10225,4.777023203169214
8745645,4,B019PC8FMS,"During a time where women's wrestling is truly climbing the charts TNA Wrestling releases this DVD that showcases their Knockouts. The DVD has 3 hours of matches from mostly 2014-2015. There's plenty of great matches on this DVD. This is a great Knockout fix. Only downside is their focus on so many multi-man matches and no Gail vs. Taryn matches. But other then that good DVD.
