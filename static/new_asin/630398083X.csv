743860,5,630398083X,I think that JAG is brilliant and wish that it was available to buy on video in the UK. I would buy them all.,999302400,5,109,3.5833333333333335
743861,5,630398083X,"JAG is very entertaining.  It has all the elements for a good time at the movies.  Of the actors, Terry O'Quinn stands out as the tough CAG, Thomas Boone.  Overall this is an exciting and intriguing  film.",959212800,4,205,4.45945945945946
744232,5,630398083X,"Awesome-I didn't know any of the series was available on VHS OR DVD. I've been searching because I became a fan late into the series and was trying to catch up on the history of the show.  Then they went and cancelled it! I agree that this series needs put on DVD...all of the seasons.  After all of the stupid series that have been made into DVD, i cannot believe that JAG hasn't made it yet.  Come on and get the picture!",1125014400,10,423,4.134146341463414
744233,5,630398083X,"Fabulous show. Amazes me the number of stupid TV series that are being pumped out in droves yet an intelligent, witty, entertaining, upstanding show like this has yet to be considered for DVD release. What are these studios thinking???",1108684800,33,235,5.051282051282051
744234,5,630398083X,"I agree that this is the best series on TV.  The cast is excellent and the story lines are great.  I just recently discovered the show in syndication, but I am so addicted.  Please, Please, Please put this show on DVD. You will make a alot of us very happy and you will make a fortune.",1094515200,16,285,4.053571428571429
744235,5,630398083X,Please tell me when the various series of JAG is being released. I cannot get any information anywhere for this. It is our familys favourite TV series.,1093392000,11,151,4.62962962962963
744236,5,630398083X,I would like to see this go on to be a DVD box set with the whole series on it...i work in a movie store and have been asked several times about this and would like to see it happen.,1090022400,7,182,3.575
744237,5,630398083X,"I have read many of the reviews of the folks who wrote about the Series JAG.  I want to add my LOUD agreement with them when they speak of JAG being the BEST show on TV!  I have taped many of the shows, and am trying to put them in order, but by looking at the list of episodes, I discover I have missed many!!  I SURE WOULD like to see the whole series on tape or dvd..IN SEQUENCE!!
MY KUDO's to the Cast, crew and directors, and the writers!  Great Job!!  A.Anderson",1087171200,10,468,3.989247311827957
744238,5,630398083X,"I enjoyed this video very much.  As in many of the other reviews, I am also a big JAG fan.  Other series such as Friends and West Wing are out on DVD.  Please bring the full set of JAG out on DVD also, ASAP.",1083888000,14,207,3.659090909090909
744239,5,630398083X,What a great video! It really filled in some gaps for me in JAG history. I definitely agree that the series should be made available on VHS and DVD. It's a real treat for Jagniks everywhere.,1083369600,5,190,4.305555555555555
744240,4,630398083X,"When will the whole series be out on DVD or even VHS? I started watching JAG just recently and I fell in love with the show. It has everything that a  series should have. So of course I just had to see the very beginning. I was not dissapointed, these guys have grown over the years wonderfully. I highly recommend this film to any JAG fan or anyone looking for a good decent movie that you can sit down with your children or,in my case grandchildren and watch over again. As a long time fan of Magnum P.I. and Quantum Leap I don""t know what took me so long. So if you are into anything with a little bit of military action ,law, romance, morality, comedy, action, intrigue, mystery and don't forget our starring hotties, well what is left. Oh right, how could I forget cast, crew and writers who aren't afraid to mention God and faith on their show.????",1077667200,3,854,4.3375
744241,5,630398083X,Do your best to bug ANYONE to get this series on DVD!!!,1075593600,13,55,3.6666666666666665
744451,5,630398083X,"I haven't seen this video, but i have watched every episode from the pilot episode to season 2, then from season 7 to the end of season 8, as these were the only episodes shown in the UK.  I agree with all the other viewers in wanting a complete set of the JAG on DVD or VHS as I am a JAG-a-holic.  Please can we have the complete set soon, can the UK have the new season soon as well please as I can't wait to find out what happens next.",1060905600,,438,3.802197802197802
744452,5,630398083X,"I HAVE TAPED ALMOST ALL OF THE EPISODES SINCE MEMORIAL DAY OF 2002. I MISSED THE LAST EPSIODE ""A TANGLED WEBB"". THIS ONE COUNTED DUE TO THE ENDING OF THE SEASON. I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE THE IDEA OF ALL THE SHOWS ON DVDS. I SEE THAT I AM WITH THE REST OF THE REVIEWERS IN WANTING THIS. JAG IS THE BEST SHOW ON TV AND BETWEEN CBS AND USA NETWORK THERE ARE NO OTHER CHANNELS ON TV.SEE IF WE CAN BUY JAG ON DVDS SOON, EVEN ON vhs FORMAT WOULD BE OK. I CAN ONLY RATE JAG AS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV
BY THE WAY, I AM 72 AND RETIRED. I WATCH DAY & EVENINGS.

744453,5,630398083X,I find this is a great show. It is shown on 2 channels occaisionly in the UK and I still not have seen all the episodes. The stories are great especially in the later series. When are the producers going to produce either DVD or VHS series? I am sure there are enough people to warranr this as it is agreat Navy programme,1051488000,3,321,4.111111111111111
744454,5,630398083X,Best series on TV today. Can we get it on DVD anytime soon???,1044230400,6,61,3.769230769230769
744455,5,630398083X,"This is a great episode about navy lawyers and the show itself,
What I and many fans around the world cannot understand is,
why there is no video or dvd collections for us to buy.
There are a lot of bad shows that have made it on dvd and video .
It's about time something was done , I would sell my car to obtain all the series of JAG on dvd or tape ,especially now that it is in it's 8 season .signed  JAG fan from Australia",1036368000,17,425,3.8295454545454546

744457,5,630398083X,"I really enjoy watching this video and wish that there were more of them. I enjoy all of the actor's and actresses in this series.  If you had more, I would certainly buy them.  I can only hope that CBS or Mr. Bellisario reads these reviews of the show and releases them as video's, especially ""Lifeline""",1026518400,,304,4.410714285714286
744458,4,630398083X,"I and my husband were Marines stationed at Cherry Point Marine Air Station in North Carolina, during WWII.  I love the show and am eagerly waiting for Harm and Mac to finally come together.
I taped the episode which was a re-run recently called Silent Service and my tape messed up. Anyway I can get a copy of this?",1004572800,4,315,4.338983050847458
744459,5,630398083X,I'm a french woman and i hope like many fans that CBS will put all the episodes on video in an english version or a french one.,999907200,2,127,3.740740740740741

7857538,1,630398083X,We have enjoyed this dvd. Starting watching and went through it in no time. Nice to see shows in order. Easy to follow plot of story. We got the whole series.,1392249600,,158,4.129032258064516
7857539,3,630398083X,"Great, it was as advertised, and competitively priced against other products that I saw. I would purchase from this site again",1357689600,,126,5.0476190476190474
7857540,5,630398083X,WOW.  We were surprised to see the difference between this premiere episode and the continuing programs. Love this movie. So glad we got it.,1353974400,,140,4.833333333333333
7857541,5,630398083X,"JAG is truly the best TV show that I have seen.  The entire 10 seasons are finally available on DVD and am going to purchase. I sincerely hope CBS and Bellesarius do some type of reunion show/movie - that would be truy awesome.  Too bad they couldn't bring the series back with wider cast so that they could ""rotate"" characters/shows every week or two and it wouldn't be as much of a grind for the main characters.  Also like the spin-off series NCIS a lot as well and will eventually purchase the complete set when available.  NCIS-LA isn't bad but hopefully will build some substance into the show.  I have even got my brother-in-law hooked on NCIS now.  Hope to get him hooked on JAG too. These two shows are the only ones I consider ""too good to miss"" and will gladly spend the money on purchasing the DVD sets.",1267920000,,815,4.4
7857542,5,630398083X,"I started watching JAG late in the series and was immediately hooked.  The acting is exceptional, the show is free of gratuitous violence, no boring steamy sex and lots of good stories.  The chemistry between Mac and Harm is palpable.  I just bought the first three series and will buy the rest as they become available.  I certainly hope all of the seasons will be offered to the public soon.  It is very exiting to own this award winning series.",1168560000,,447,4.5375
7857543,5,630398083X,"I cannot understand why the J.A.G. seasons are not released on DVD. I've been watching it for years, here in Germany, and would very much like to watch the original. I think especially the first 6-7 seasons are simply gorgeus, best American entertainment, heroic and touching, good characters, good acting,well built stories. So why not on DVD? Many of my friends would surely buy it.",1138665600,11,384,4.923076923076923
7857544,5,630398083X,"I have been a fan since the pilot episode.  I enjoy the well thought out plots and find Harm and co-stars to be delightful to watch.  I was very disappointed when Meg was replaced with Mac, but it hasn't stopped me from watching every episode.

Can someone please tell me when the series will be released on DVD????

Only in VHS and only the pilot????????????? what'r u thinking about!!!!!! what 'r u waiting for!!!!",1132012800,10,147,5.125
7857546,5,630398083X,"All this talk about JAG becoming available for release on DVD, has it happened yet? My 87 year old father loves this program, but can only see re-runs on ocassion as they air only sporadically in his area. He was in the Navy during World War II and this program is important to him. Please advise when this serires becomes available on DVD for regular Americans.

Thanks, Charlie
