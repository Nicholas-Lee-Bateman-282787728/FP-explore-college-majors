2788782,5,B000O1715M,"This DVD is a fascinating insight into the Romanov family. The actors, especially Tsar Nicholas, were fabulous. Of course, we all know how it ends. But watching it, after understanding how kind, generous and noble the family was, made me tear up. So brutal and unjust.

If you are a Romanov or a history fan, get this DVD.",1291593600,14,322,4.551724137931035
2788783,5,B000O1715M,Documenting the last days of the Romanov Dynasty the film shows Tsar Nicholas and his family in the last year of thier lives from the abdication of the Tsar to the brutal murder of the Imperial family at the hands of the Bolshivicks at the House of Special Purposes. The film shows the Imperail family as loving and tight. They are completely isloated and have only themselves to be around. While the film may be somewhat over sentimental towards the Imperial family and tries to reconsile Russia with its Communist past this film is by far the most accurate potrayal yet. A film that cannot be missed for all history lovers and those interested in the Romanovs.,1265760000,22,662,4.666666666666667
2788784,4,B000O1715M,"The revival of rare French operas seems to be Compiegne's specialty. This opera company, presumably with large government grants, is making a significant survey of the forgotten byways of Gallic vocal art.
Auber's HAYDEE is a real charmer which mixes lovely tunes, piquant orchestration, swashbuckling adventure, an interesting psychological take on addictive behavior (in this case gambling), and all obstacles overcome by selfless love.
The two female leads are taken by Compiegne's resident divas, Isabelle Philippe, a fine coloratura as the title character, a Greek slave girl who wins the love of the Doge by her steadfastness, and Anne Sophie Schmidt, a lovely French lyric soprano as the general/Doge's ward. Philippe is not quite as good here as she was in the DVD of Meyerbeer's DINORAH. The part seems to lie very low for a coloratura. It seems to be
a mezzo-soprano part onto which some high notes have been melded so that it can be taken by a higher voice. Despite weakness at the bottom, she makes a strong impression and focuses beautifully at the top. She is also a very appealing actress, as is Schmidt. (There is a lovely CD on the Cascavelle label of Philippe in scenes from the current work, DINORAH and Halevy's CHARLES VI which has never been released here. It is well worth seeking out, considering the rarity of the Auber and Halevy works.) Tenor Bruno Comparetti is really fine in the role of the guilt wracked Doge whose gambling problems have negatively affected both the others and himself. His dream/mad scene is particularly fine. His voice is not beautiful, but he makes up for it with solid technique and  dramatic involvement. Second tenor Mathias Vidal brings lovely tone and a lively stage presence to the ""matinee idol"" role. His singing of the cabaletta-like opening section of a quartet for two sopranos and two tenors in the first act is one of the highlights of the work. Bass-Baritone Paul Medioni is a splendidly creepy and unctuous villain. Conductor Swierczewski clearly loves this work and brings both fine dramatic pacing and lovely detailing to the work of the Orchestre Alberic Magnard.
The production is solidly old fashioned, a visually delightful  recreation of Venice in the late eighteenth century.
Despite too small a chorus, director Pierre Jourdan fills the stage with lots of action and arresting tableaux.",1236643200,12,2362,5.038363171355499

2788801,4,B000O1715M,"This film's noteworthy historical value rests largely on the fact that it was filmed in rooms in which the Imperial family actually lived.  Most of those in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo have been heavily restored---in some cases entirely reconstructed---after the serious damage the palace suffered in World War II. The restorations were based on contemporary photographs and are unusually accurate examples of such projects.  Even the scene in which Nicholas, Alexandra and their daughter Marie are seen descending the staircase of the Governor's residence in Tobolsk, on their way to Ekaterinburg, takes place on the actual stairway in question.  This attention to historical detail, rare in such films but possible because this one was created in Russia, gives the film a haunting sense of truth.  (This does not include the Ipatiev house in Ekaterinburg, where the family were murdered in July 1918; it was demolished in the 1970s.)

That sense does not, however, extend to other aspects of the film.  The narration and captions dwell heavily on the loving relations within the Imperial family, and much of the script and action is geared to driving home that point.  Unfortunately the emphasis on the family relations forced the filmmakers to omit much historical context that would make it clear why the family goes through the trials and tribulations they suffer.  While it is clear the Revolution of 1917 is taking place, then, we aren't given much material that would help us understand why that revolution came about, or what happened during it.  We see a bomb being tossed outside the Winter Palace in St Petersburg, and some people are killed; that's about it.  The film focuses almost compulsively on Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, their children and the loyalty they inspired in those around them. In the last analysis this narrow focus gives ""The Romanovs"" a somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere.  We never see Rasputin, for example; Alexandra refers to him, but the extent of his influence on the Empress goes unseen, as does the extent of the damage he did to public respect for the Imperial family.

I think it needs to be kept in mind that until 1989, most Soviet/Russian people didn't know much about Nicholas and his family, and their atrocious deaths were a taboo subject.  Nicholas was remembered as a bloody tyrant and his German-born wife as the tool of an unscrupulous charlatan posing as a holy man.  Possibly it was judged advisable that this first effort at a genuinely Russian portrayal of the Romanovs should be handled gently, lest the blunders of the Provisional Government in 1917 and the brutality of the Soviet takeover later that year should shoulder their way to the fore. (That is a major problem with other Romanov biofilms, especially ""Nicholas and Alexandra,"" filmed in the West in the '70s, in which the Romanov family almost have to fight for screen time with the government's problems, the agonies of the laboring class, and Russia's ordeals during World War I.)

There are some puzzling historical slips here.  After they suffered serious attacks of measles early in 1917, just as the Revolution was breaking out in St Petersburg, the Tsarevich and the Grand Duchesses began losing their hair. They all had their heads shaved. The film appropriately deals with that much.  But the Grand Duchesses still have hardly any hair when they are killed, nearly 18 months later.  Accounts of their last days make it clear that by then, their hair had grown to shoulder length.  I can only guess that someone had the actresses' hair cut short at a time when the company couldn't wait for the hair to grow back.  Ideally, scenes with the actresses' hair at full length would be shot first; then their hair would be cut to shoulder length for the final scenes to be filmed, and then clipped short for the middle scenes, soon after their illnesses. I assume that someone misjudged the schedule and the haircuts were administered too soon.  Unfortunate and, at first glance, very puzzling.

What we have here, then, is a dramatically flawed film with admirable production values.  Even costumes are based on existing photographs of the family, and we are treated to a brief demonstration of Anastasia's habit of making faces when someone photographed her.  But what could have been the historical value of the film has been sacrificed to something that comes perilously close to an Imperial soap opera.  It's a good way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon, and it provides an intriguing glimpse into the way the last Romanovs really lived, even to the decoration of the Grand Duchesses' bedrooms.  As a means to explain why this devotedly loving family came to the hideous ends they endured, however, it can't quite get out of the starting gate.",1404259200,,4809,4.965087281795511
2788802,5,B000O1715M,"As some of the other reviewers have indicated, this monumental epic is in many ways the finest film to depict the last months of the Romanovs of Russia. Director Gleb Panfilov has brought together a group of fine actors, who portray extremely  well some difficult and complex events, but with clarity that even a person not versed in Russian history can understand. At times it seems that we are watching a documentary or docu-drama, but, no, the camera gives us real life emotions, anger, despair, occasional moments of happiness and, above all, the love of Nicholas II for his wife and family. Panfilov is able very skillfully to integrate history with the story line. Certainly, we know the eventual outcome, yet that outcome in no way detracts from the unfolding and engrossing story that each of the characters presents. I kept going back to NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA for a comparison: both films are filmed on a superbly sketched palate, lush vistas and beautiful interiors which increasingly become darker and more confining as the films move along.  Yet, THE ROMANOVS seems to possess more passion, more intensity--at least for me. There is also more detail, but it is all superbly integrated.  The final scene of the film, the execution, is riveting, even though we know it's coming. And, then, a kind of apotheosis, if you will....a short postscript, a short scene from the Canonization of the Tsar and his family at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. Despite what some might say, it fits and is a fitting conclusion to this epic, and in a real sense, brings closure to the horrid wound that was inflicted on Russia in July 1918.",1399334400,8,1648,4.836879432624113
2788803,5,B000O1715M,I really love this Movie so much. It has plenty of information that was not covered in the Nicholas and Alexandra Movie. I watch it over and over again.,1386720000,4,152,4.275862068965517
2788804,4,B000O1715M,Enjoyed to movie but a one point dvd skipped ahead. It was a packaged new dvd so I guess it was a glitch on the dvd. So no ones fault I guess.,1365120000,,142,3.46875
2788805,5,B000O1715M,"I got everything I hoped to out of this dvd.  It's a nice presentation of a lesser-known French opera.  Auber's tunes are lovely and the French singers are very good.  I have watched it a couple times and listened to it as an audio recording at least once so far.  The only really bad thing about the dvd is the filming of the orchestra and conductor at the beginning - the camera stays focused on the conductor the whole time and he puts on a show for the camera that is a bit cheesy.  Other than that, everything is good. I love these all-French casts in this series of French opera on dvd - really nice.",1355097600,3,606,4.189655172413793
2788806,3,B000O1715M,"The sets and costumes were fine and the music pleasant enough. Singing ok too. One for the collectors of rarities.
However this opera is not quite up to the standard of the more well known efforts of Auber and the story is somewhat weak.",1355011200,,237,4.409090909090909
2788807,5,B000O1715M,"This movie is much better than Nicholas and Alexandra. It has a more authentic overtone, since it is a Russian production, yet it is has English subtitles for those who cannot understand Russian. It is just over two hours long, and documents the Russian royal family's existence from Nicholas's abdication on March 1/14, 1917 to the family's tragic demise on the night of July 16/17, 1918.",1317600000,16,389,4.909090909090909
2788808,3,B000O1715M,"I felt this movie was very shallow in its interpretation of events. Not because they were portrayed inaccurately (which was the case, in some instances) but because it omitted pertinent events/people: i.e. Rasputin is almost left out completely - I can only recall seeing him in for a few seconds amongst a group of another people!!!

I much preferred Franklin J. Schaffner movie 'Nicholas and Alexandra' (1971) - I thought THAT version was far more comprehensive.",1297296000,3,464,5.105263157894737
8182514,5,B000O1715M,"This is an excellent film from Russia about the last days of the Romanovs. In comparing this film to the 1971 British film Nicholas and Alexandra, both have pluses and minuses. The British film spans over several years of Tsar Nicholas II's reign with the final scene in that basement room of the infamous Ipatiev house in Ekaterinburg on July 17, 1918. This Russian version from 2000 starts in February, 1917 shortly before Nicholas's decision to abdicate the Russian Imperial Throne. Overall I consider this Russian film better and more accurate to what really happened in the final days of the Romanov family. The big advantage that this version has over it's British predecessor is that it was filmed on actual locations in Russia where the Romanovs were at including the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, the Imperial Train and the Governor's House in Tobolsk during their imprisonment. In regards to the Russian actors and actresses portraying the Romanov family, all were excellent in particular the actresses playing Grand Duchess Olga and Grand Duchess Tatiana. Also impressive in his role was the youngster portraying Alexi. The beautiful actress portraying Olga was a dead ringer for the real Grand Duchess! I enjoyed the film very much and I highly recommend it even though we all known the outcome in the end.",1522108800,,1324,5.0227272727272725

8182516,5,B000O1715M,"This was made by Russians obviously. I noted the Woman who played the Tsarina looks much like a English actress. This was also a great portrayal of the Family and how much they loved each other. Their deaths were a tragedy that should not happen.
The Tsar cooperated with the Russians and resigned when they asked. Unfortunately for them the new regime eventually planned to kill them BUT I believe the Tsar knew something ominous was coming.",1480291200,2,442,4.753246753246753

8182519,5,B000O1715M,"The best film I've seen about the last Tzar and his doomed family. They even managed to include romance in the midst of tragedy.
Fine acting.  Subtle rendering of hopelessness in the expressive faces of the actors, especially of the young heir and in his sister, Olga. My favorite scene was the singing and dancing of the royal children when Olga discovers she has an admirer in one of the soldiers guarding them. Beautiful version of the Neapolitan song ""Reginella"" (Little Queen), the love theme of Olga and her soldier.",1429747200,2,522,4.8

8182523,4,B000O1715M,"The film follows the last year of the Romanov family from the abdidcation of the tsar to the murder of the family in July 1918. It has one advantage against ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" (1971): apart from the Ipatjew House that was torn down in the 1970s, the actual places could be used. But despite that, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" still remains the better film: it shows how it came to the downfall of the Romanows. Here the film starts with the downfall. This film was made for a Russian audience for which the fate of the Romanov family had been a taboo for almost 70 years. With this reservation: a well directed, well acted movie.",1415750400,3,631,4.543859649122807
