2891359,5,B000SUKPQG,Brainy baby has yet to disappoint. My son loves all the videos and gets a thrill out of counting past 10. Highly recommend!,1362528000,2,123,4.391304347826087
2891360,5,B000SUKPQG,"My 2 year old loves this DVD.  If you have a little boy/girl that's really into numbers, I would highly recommend this product!  Don't be surprised if they start counting to 20 the very next day!!! :)  Thanks Amazon / Brainy Baby!!",1355875200,,231,4.4523809523809526
2891361,2,B000SUKPQG,"I am not sure how should I rate this item.  I was searching for a disc that teaches numbers and counting.  This does the job very well. It's simple, straight forward, but super boring. Almost put me to sleep when I was watching it with my 19 month old toddler. You hear ONE, and see the number ""1"", and one object appear.  This is repeated with different object 3-4 times.  Then it goes to TWO.  And you hear the count...One, Two....again with a different object,  3-4 times.  By the time you get to 20, you have already heard ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE.......a hundred time.

There is no pause in between to ""wake up"" the sleepyhead with songs at all.  I have to say it's boring. I wish the maker put some songs to entertain the viewer.",1325203200,,734,4.299270072992701
2891362,5,B000SUKPQG,"I have the entire collection of Brainy Baby DVDs.  These new releases are great and are updated. I know the products have been around and have helped many children learn their basics.  This newest release is the same teaching quality, but now has the introduction of a few cute characters, which is very nice.  Still a real-life, live-action type of visuals, but a few characters make it even more fun.  Highly recommend any Brainy DVD or book product.",1320883200,7,452,4.756410256410256
2891363,3,B000SUKPQG,"We own several videos of these series, and my daughters do enjoy them all. This video is great if only because of the repetition of the numbers (they sure learn to recite them) but it does get a little boring past 10. My daughters get distracted at this point, which doesn't happen with the other videos.",1320278400,,304,4.446428571428571
2891364,3,B000SUKPQG,"My son seems to love these Brainy Baby DVD...but they never really taught him anything. He learned his ABC's and 123's from me teaching him. He was never really interested in this ""number"" DVD, but enjoys the ABC DVD. I am not disappointed in these, as I would never expect a DVD to teach my child anything- just thought they were very corny and annoying, much like Baby Einstein. Good purchase if you are just looking for something for your child to be slightly interested in.",1291852800,,477,4.558139534883721

8207022,5,B000SUKPQG,My 4 year old and 2 year old boys love this DVDs!! And I rather put this on then cartoons!,1523836800,,90,3.55
8207023,3,B000SUKPQG,"It's a good video for a baby, but certainly not for a three year old. The age range on this video says for 2-4. It should say for 2 & under. My three year old screams for me to take this DVD out of the player. I can't blame her. She is too old for this. Highly comparable to the pace of Baby Einstein. It will put you to sleep.",1470441600,2,327,3.6857142857142855
