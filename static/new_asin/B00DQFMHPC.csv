At last I now have the full collection so I can watch and enjoy one of best Disney Afternoon cartoon shows of the 90's.

5847324,5,B00DQFMHPC,"In honor of my 'big 3-0' today, and on behalf of other fans of classic Disneytoon TV shows, here's a review of the 3rd and final volume set of Talespin! The last 11 episodes of this classic series are on this 2-disc DVD set, which is strangely in a black case instead of a clear one, with no art or episode guide in the inner cover whatsoever! This was originally on DVD in 2013 only from the Disney Movie Club, but it didn't get released everywhere until January of 2015, for the show's 25th anniversary! As popular as Talespin was, and still is today, it only had 1 season, but with a whomping 65 shows, all of which are now on DVD with this set and volumes 1 and 2! Many game shows have HUNDREDS of different episodes in 1 season, as with soap operas past and present! Baloo, Kit, Rebecca, & Molly have easily beat their fellow Disneytoon series to being concluded on DVD, other than the Weekenders from the Disney Movie Club, but lots of much older AND newer Disneytoon TV series have never been concluded on DVD to this day, so just be thankful for what you already have! Make sure volumes 1 and 2 of Talespin aren't alone and conclude the series with volume 3 on DVD today!",1503792000,,1179,4.315315315315315

We have been watching them with our boys and it has been a trip down memory lane. Baloo has always been one of my favorites and his dynamic with Rebecca (based on Rebecca from Cheers) is fun to watch. I was surprised at how I remembered all of the episodes and would highly recommend this series to fans of Disney.",1428451200,4,582,4.339449541284404

5847375,5,B00DQFMHPC,"It's finally here. This 2 disc set contains the last 11 episodes of the awesome series Talespin.

Disc 1.
1. Destiny Rides Again
2. Mach One For The Gipper
3. Stuck On You
4. The Sound and The Furry
5. The Ransom of Red Chimp
6. The Road To Macadamia
7. Your Baloo's In The Mail

Disc 2.
1. Paradise Lost
2. The Incredible Shrinking Molly
3. Bygones
4. Flying Dupes*

*Yes this set contains the episode deemed controversial after the 9/11 attacks, due to Baloo being tricked into taking a bomb into Thembria. You just have to take this episode with a pinch of salt, but otherwise it's pretty harmless, especially since this was made before 9/11. It's great though that it made it onto DVD without much difficulty.

What could have been included on this set though to REALLY complete things, is the TV movie version of 'Plunder and Lightning' which has some scenes removed from the syndicated TV episodic version. It could have been included on the last disc without it effecting the quality, or it could have been a 3 disc set with the movie on the third disc. That would have made a nice little bonus, but it wasn't to be. It could still be released as a stand alone release, maybe one day?

But despite that, this is a great set, especially if you just want to complete the TV series, which you can now with this long awaited 3rd volume. It was certainly worth the wait. :)",1425686400,6,1375,4.397637795275591
5847376,5,B00DQFMHPC,Finally Disney gave us this opportunity! If you like to have all the episodes of the serie you cannot resist: you have to buy this dvd.,1424908800,2,135,4.230769230769231

5847382,5,B00DQFMHPC,"Disney finished one of there Disney Afternoon sets...Actualy two since Gargoles got a final volume as well, this is actualy a wide release of disks that had been out for a while.  About a year ago though only though Disney's online store and a few months ago at Walmart (When I got it).  Now if they could just finish the other half dozen shows they hadn't finished that would be nice.",1421193600,10,385,4.408450704225352

5847386,5,B00DQFMHPC,Walt Disney Studios have finally released the remaining episodes of Talespin on DVD. This is a nice 2-disc set containing all the remaining episodes that were previously unreleased.

5847387,5,B00DQFMHPC,The Seller was AWESOME to deal with and this last set of episodes was TOTALLY worth paying the extra for them,1413244800,,109,4.238095238095238
5847388,5,B00DQFMHPC,"The quality of storytelling in all the Disney Afternoon shows is attested to by its longtime fans, and while some will note the series for its comedy and attention to detail, for me it is the historical characters that stand out. As a long time fan of WWI biplanes, I loved the episodes with such memorable characters as Whistlestop Jackson and Joe McGee, but above all the famous Rick Sky and his Squadron of Seven.

That episode (Bygones) was one they rarely showed even in the old days, and while I still have a copy somewhere on VHS I eagerly awaited the arrival of TaleSpin on DVD. Imagine my dismay when ""Bygones"" was overlooked! So I had to wait until now to reclaim this 20-plus year old prize. Even though it would have been nice to have seen a higher-quality copy of the video, it's still a clean one and the audio's in good shape. So sit back and enjoy a classic, and join me at Louie's when you're done.",1410134400,4,915,4.382352941176471

5847395,5,B00DQFMHPC,"I wished this had commentary and behind the scenes documentaries. It is the 11 episode leftovers from the previously released volume 1 and volume 2. It doesn't matter. I still have a crush on Rebecca Cunningham-- she appeals to me. These are not the strongest episodes. Those are on volume 1. Yet I still love the stories, drawings, and characters of Cape Suzette. Reminds me of The Rocketeer, which Disney made at the same time. There are many references to Indiana Jones, but I prefer TaleSpin over Indiana Jones.
