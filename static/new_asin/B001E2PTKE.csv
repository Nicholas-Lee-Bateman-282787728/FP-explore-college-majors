8296165,3,B001E2PTKE,"This video adequately covers some basic chemistry and then leads into definitions of the molecules and organelles found in the cell as well as the chemical processes (photosynthesis and cellular respiration) that occur there. The film is basically a lecture provided by a cast of enthusiastic youth, punctuated by low quality graphics and fast moving definitions. I bought this because I was hoping for some visuals that only a video can provide - 3D graphics of what macromolecules look like, a cell dividing, or a better look at different types of cells. With no textbooks and poor microscopes in my classroom, I wanted a video that would give students a better idea of what these tiny things look like. Unfortunately, this video is not that and I won't bother showing it to my class. I did not buy the full set of this, so I cannot comment on the others in the series.",1489708800,,871,4.699346405228758
