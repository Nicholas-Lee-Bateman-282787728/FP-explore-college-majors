7937812,4,B00005BJU7,"This is a 4/5 star film if compared with other hour-long B features of the day, not when compared with the A features of the same time period. There are plot holes big enough for ace pilot 3-star (Lyle Talbot) to fly his plane through, but that's OK, because the pace is brisk and the film is full of action. I won't list all of the questions that the characters - not to mention the screenplay writer - should have been asking, because I'd give too much away.

Suffice it to say that pilot Bob 'Three Star' Halsey gets himself grounded for hot-shotting in the air near the airport where he is based. His boss would love to fire him, but both the boss and Three Star know he's too good a pilot for him to lose him to another airline. Of course Halsey has a girl, Judy Wagner (Ann Dvorak), and Judy has a brother who is also a pilot based out of the airport. Up to now Judy has been having to share Bob with his love of the air, but along comes an espionage plot centering around an important invention needed by the military that is to be transported by the airline that soon changes everything.

There are some great aerial scenes here, and although the laws of reason - and sometimes physics as well as the limitations of human eyesight - are being violated left and right, it turns out to be fun although somewhat formulaic without being corny.

Don't let the fact that this is an Alpha print dissuade you, it is as good a transfer as they would show on TCM - good contrast, minimum noise and scratches, good sound - it looks like a Warner Home Video release.",1313798400,2,1562,4.288135593220339

7937814,3,B00005BJU7,"This quick little programmer from Warner Brothers stars Lyle Talbot as a hotshot pilot (was there any other kind?) who finds himself mixed up in a plot to steal important government military information.  His stewardess girlfriend Ann Dvorak also becomes caught up in the plot.  However, character and dialogue aren't what this film is about.  Like any Warner Bros film, the emphasis is on action, and director D. Ross Lederman provides the viewer with plenty of aerial action (and ground action as well).  The movie moves along quickly and tightly and is finished in just over an hour.  As programmers go, it is well done and entertaining, delivering exactly what you would expect.",1019779200,5,682,5.0
