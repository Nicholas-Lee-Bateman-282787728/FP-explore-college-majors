I really think that he did a phenomenal job, being that this is his first film as a director.  The actors were amazing as well....and the singing was really a showcase.  Whether you are a student at FAMU, a movie buff or a 'collector', please support this movement/empire that J. Bland is leading.

You did a great job James!!!!!
