8666991,5,B00LNRLJLI,"The second installation of Treeschoolers is arguably better than the first.  It has more Rachel, more Treeschoolers (the characters) and more catchy songs?  Trust me, YOU'LL be singing the songs, even when your kids are nowhere around.  Trust me, when your kid starts singing about photosynthesis, you'll know you made the right decision buying this DVD.  In addition to all the educational content, it also promotes kindness, understanding and curiosity about the world around you.",1446854400,,482,5.386666666666667
8666992,5,B00LNRLJLI,"You haven't seen cute until you've seen a chubby two-year-old walking down the street singing quietly to himself: ""Photo-syn-the-sis, PHO-TO-synthe-sis."" My sons love this whole series. They ask for ""Rachel"" by name, and they dance along to the performances. Thanks, Two Little Hands!",1430352000,,284,5.627906976744186
8666993,5,B00LNRLJLI,"TreeSchoolers are awesome! We've backed all of the TLH campaigns on Kickstarter. My 3 year old loves these shows. My 10 year old enjoys them too. My three teenagers have even been caught humming the tunes. I can't say enough about how educational and inspirational these shows are. We have loved and used all of TLH's productions for years. Signing Time helped us communicate better with our babies and toddlers, not to mention, it helped me learn to communicate better with my deaf neighbors. TreeSchoolers continues the Signing Time standard of excellence and gives pre-schoolers a chance to be inspired and educated while being entertained (not to mention they give Mom a chance to get a little guilt-free free time!). That's a win for everyone! My littlest one still talks about photosynthesis when we are outside in the garden and often asks me if Rachel made it rain when she sees the rain coming down. And I must admit that the 5 Spring Flowers song is one that I just adore. So cute!",1430265600,,991,4.734104046242774

8666995,5,B00LNRLJLI,"My four year old twins (boy/girl one with delays) have grown up with Rachel - from baby signing to treeschoolers.
Just this last week my son got to share this dvd with his preschool class and they all loved it.
He was so excited to sing along and since Then he has been asking for all the new ones we don't have.

It's filled with facts, fun, and keeps them from being bored. I highly recommend any of their products.",1430265600,,417,4.2125
8666996,5,B00LNRLJLI,"We LOVE Rachel and the TreeSchoolers.  We started watching when our daughter was 3 years old. She is now 4 and still loving all of the the TreeSchooler DVD's. If your ready for your child to learn all about photosynthesis and other wonderful topics, look no further! Rachel is amazing and connects with the kids. Each of the animated characters are fun.  We are one of the original backers of this Kickstarter. For us, after the success of Baby Signing Time, Potty Time, and Signing Time, in our home, it was a no brainer to be a backer for Rachel and the TreeSchoolers! We are so thankful that Rachel and the gang decided that ""too educational for tv"" would not stop them from making a truly amazing show for kids who are ready to learn!",1430265600,,738,4.45925925925926
8666997,5,B00LNRLJLI,"We are so impressed with TreeSchoolers!  It is educational and fun.  Our kids love to watch it and we don't feel guilty about screen time.  My 4.5 year old and 2 year old both love TreeSchoolers and know all the songs.  Our favorite is Grow Little Seed. My daughter crouches down pretending to be a plant growing while singing, ""Every seed, yes every one, has a tiny plant inside... when placed in soil and watered right, the little seedling grows."" They are singing these fun songs and learning at the same time.",1430265600,,513,4.543478260869565
8666998,5,B00LNRLJLI,"As new parents we decided that we wanted to teach our daughter sign language from an early age.  That is how we found Two Little Hands production and their Baby Signing Time products.  As our daughter grew and developed we moved into their regular Signing Time products as well.  Since Two Little Hands Productions and Rachel have become a staple in our home, when I heard that they were launching a Kickstarter campaign for the Treeschoolers videos I was compelled to become one of their original backers even though my kids were too young for preschool videos.  My kids are now 16 months and 3 years old but the Treeschoolers videos are a favorite for both of them.  My 3 year old has learned how plants grow, how thunder and lightning are created, and the features that make an insect different from other animals.  These videos are not only very educational, but they make learning fun.  The characters are loveable, the songs are fun and will leave you and your kid singing them for days after you watched the video, and the content is presented in a way that helps kids learn the subject.  Being a proponent of teaching sign language to our kids, I have also been pleased that there is some sign language mixed into the lessons as well.
We have been backers for all of the Treeschooler campaigns and my kids both get excited when a new DVD shows up.  My three year old regularly bursts into songs from the show and my 16 month old gets excited when the videos come on and she claps her hands and dances around and signs more or again when the videos end.
You won't be disappointed with these videos content and your kids are sure to love them for years to come!  These are a valuable addition to your video library!",1430265600,,1721,4.487179487179487
8666999,5,B00LNRLJLI,"My three year old and 18 month old cannot get enough of Rachel and the Treeschoolers! This episode is by far one of my favorites. I am constantly singing the Five Spring Flowers and Photosynthesis songs, they are so catchy! Rachel Coleman and her team are brilliant in the way they have written and produced these shows. Not only do they feature fun characters, super cute kids, songs and american sign language, your child will actually LEARN something from watching. I backed this project on Kickstarter and I am SO glad I did. Parents, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. You and your kids will be so happy you did!",1430265600,,620,4.544642857142857
