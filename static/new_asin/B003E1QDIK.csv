4112624,1,B003E1QDIK,"This film deserves to be nominated for the Stupidest Movie Ever Made Award. There are no Golden Retrievers in this movie anywhere, much less puppies, just a yellow lab with hardly any part to play. I've lost count of how many ""bumbling crook"" duos have made it into children's films, but this pair is surely the dumbest, most pathetic I have ever seen in my life! Absolutely ridiculous. The only good thing in this movie is the kids' dialogue, which is pretty realistic and nicely delivered. The rest of the movie is completely garbage. There ought to be a law against movies this terrible, and especially such misleading covers.",1316131200,2,629,4.779816513761468
4112625,5,B003E1QDIK,"It looks like this might be a kids movie about dogs, like the buddies movies and there is a dog in it, but it isn't really a kids movie. I enjoyed it.",1294876800,4,150,3.71875
4112626,4,B003E1QDIK,A very entertaining story.  Such a cute star.  I will be showing this to my great granddaughter this year.  This is a wonderful family movie.,1292025600,2,141,4.56
4112627,5,B003E1QDIK,The gold  retrievers is one of my favorite movies. My mom didn't like it but I did. I was scared when the skeleton went up into the girl's face.,1290902400,8,144,3.9655172413793105
4112628,5,B003E1QDIK,"This is a great family movie. It is a simple adventure story that is exciting and fun to watch. It reminded me of the Goonies. Although it won't be a top 10 on anyone's list, it's the perfect movie to watch with the kids on a rainy day.",1396137600,,236,3.9375
4112629,2,B003E1QDIK,"The acting is hokey (and I'm being kind).  We all became bored with it.  Glad it was free, or I would be irritated to have wasted money on it.",1395014400,,142,3.8620689655172415
4112630,3,B003E1QDIK,With the cover photo and title I thought this would be more of a dog movie but it wasn't.  It was a cute kid's movie with a nice message  but I was looking forward to a doggie film,1394755200,,180,3.710526315789474
4112631,4,B003E1QDIK,This was a fun light hearted comedy that kept my attention to the end. It was predictable but the actors and scenery were wonderful and I would recommend this movie to anyone,1394236800,,174,4.46875
4112632,4,B003E1QDIK,"It was a good adventure... I really liked the dog and the boy & the girl! , I am 7 years old!",1392940800,,93,3.272727272727273
4112633,1,B003E1QDIK,I have no idea because I didn't purchase this and I'm not sure why this is stating I did?  If this was purchased on my account it wasn't me and would like to know who did purchase it and what I paid for it??  I'm a bit confused since I have not at this time purchased any movies on the streaming and didn't purchase this movie at all!,1392422400,,334,3.8970588235294117
4112634,1,B003E1QDIK,The kids loved it but we thought it was predictable and poorly acted.  And the quality of streaming was poor so it was hard to watch.,1391990400,,133,4.115384615384615
4112635,5,B003E1QDIK,"My kids were laughing through much of this show, as the lack of intelligent bad guys attempted to retrieve part of a medallion.  A bit of the treasure hunter of the lost ark for kids with clean humor.",1391558400,,200,4.2631578947368425
4112636,1,B003E1QDIK,"great movie for kids adults hang out play game do something else. Okay ...lol
our 9 year old loved it",1391126400,,101,4.1
4112637,4,B003E1QDIK,Cute movie for kids. It's nice to be able to put on a movie for your kids and not have to worry about all the bad stuff.,1390953600,,120,3.4814814814814814
4112638,4,B003E1QDIK,I watched it with my 6-year-old grandson and he loved it.  It doesn't feature the dog very much which is why I chose it.,1390867200,,120,4.0
4112639,3,B003E1QDIK,"I think I probably liked this more than the kids as it is not ""disney"" enough for children these days.  My 5-year old liked it, but the 3-1/2 year old was bored in minutes.",1389657600,2,172,4.0588235294117645
4112640,5,B003E1QDIK,Had my Grandkids age ten and seven watch it with us. All liked the movie. Good message for young children.,1389484800,2,106,4.35
4112641,5,B003E1QDIK,"This is a terrific children's movie for kids from 7 to 9.  There some villains, some heroes, and a happy ending.  The dog is cute and a nice addition to the mix. It is part Goonies and Home Alone.  My 7 year old grand daughter enjoyed the show, which is pleasing to me.  The choice of films when she comes over to my home,and she is here often, makes a great addition to my list of things to do here.",1389139200,,400,3.9625
4112642,5,B003E1QDIK,We watched this movie with our two grandchildren who are 5 and 2 years old.  It was very entertaining fiction and a clean wholesome movie.  I would recommend this movie to other families with children.,1388966400,2,201,4.714285714285714
4112643,5,B003E1QDIK,Great moview for children with lots of action and good acting. Seeing acting animal in movies is always fun for the children,1385510400,,124,4.681818181818182
4112644,3,B003E1QDIK,"It was a very good family movie, nice to see one without terrible language and sexual implications, nudity and drugs!",1383264000,4,117,4.9
4112645,4,B003E1QDIK,"This is for young children, I was only disappointed to see there was no puppy in the show, but once I got over that I watched the adult dog and his owner discover a clue to a treasure and was not disappointed with the high jinks that the ""bad"" guys go through and the way the show was ended. If your kid likes ""Baby's Day Out"" or ""Adventures in Babysitting"" they will like this too.",1374278400,2,382,4.1066666666666665
4112646,5,B003E1QDIK,"Since I have a special love for goldies, I enjoyed this movie tremendously. They are cute when they are born and cute forever!",1361145600,,126,4.521739130434782
4112647,3,B003E1QDIK,"I purchased this DVD for my 2 and 1/2 yr old grandson, my 7 year old golden retriever and myself, as we all enjoy watching movies in which golden retrievers are the main characters.  I obviously misinterpreted the title as this movie is not about a golden retriever, but a Labrador retriever!  My viewing partners were not disappointed with the dog ""switch,"" but I was.  They were, however, quite disappointed that the dog was not the featured character in this movie.  There were lots of people and a lot of dialogue, so I have to admit that we never watched the entire DVD.  If you like movies that are about animals and have dogs in them, this could be the movie for you.  My film friends and I were a bit disappointed as we like to watch golden retrievers and like to see them in almost every scene.  I don't think ""Gold Retrievers"" was on par with the golden ""buddy"" movies, so if that's what you're looking for (cute and cuddly in the entire movie) you might want to pass this DVD by.",1316995200,7,990,4.377049180327869

8395152,4,B003E1QDIK,6-yr old loved this movie.,1405036800,,26,4.4
8395153,3,B003E1QDIK,Cute kids show. Kids would probably enjoy this one,1404864000,,50,4.666666666666667
8395154,3,B003E1QDIK,This movie is okay,1404864000,,18,3.75
8395155,4,B003E1QDIK,Sweet film with a beautiful puppy.  I always watch animal movies.  I liked the storyline with its happy ending.  My 2 pups like to watch dogs on the TV screen.,1404691200,,159,4.233333333333333
8395156,5,B003E1QDIK,"This was a bit different storyline, a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It also had great scenery.  My only complaint, and it's not just about this movie but seems every movie anymore has such loud background music that it drowns out the voices to the point where it becomes frustrating to watch.  It is a shame that this happens because so much of what is said, can't be heard.",1402617600,,373,4.537313432835821
8395157,2,B003E1QDIK,"An OK story, but the acting is pretty bad in this film.
None of the characters are very believable. Billy Zane gives the only decent performance for his role. I originally thought, hey Steve Guttenberg, Billy Zane, should be a pretty good flick for the kids. But Steve Guttenberg's weird performance of an old, clumsy treasure bandit just didn't make sense to me. It rubbed me the wrong way for some reason (sorry Steve!) But I agree with another viewer's comment that it was nice to see no foul language, inappropriate or violent material. So that says a little something. It could have been worse.",1401840000,,599,4.714285714285714
8395158,4,B003E1QDIK,Pretty good movie lots of action and yet clean enough for my grand children to watch I am saving it for my grandchildren to watch I believe they will enjoy watching it.,1398211200,,168,4.28125
