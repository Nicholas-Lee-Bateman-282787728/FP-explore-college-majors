The main lesson I got from it is that God will take our five loaves and two fish and multiply them if we are faithful. The main issue is faithfulness to the Lord in obeying His Great Commission. God may or may not allow us to see the results of our efforts. We may have to wait till we get to heaven to find out, but that's okay, because what matters is being faithful to the Lord. Frank Jenner was a faithful, humble servant of the Lord whose efforts the Lord owned and blessed greatly. In the latter years of his life brother Frank was privileged to find out about some of the results of his ministry. May we all be bold in our faith and on fire for Christ as Frank Jenner was!",1391126400,2,752,4.053691275167785
