 I was excited to order a dvd on using hot & cool stones to do chair massage.

This DVD was very disappointing. The woman teaching it, is very wooden, stiff, uses annoying ""gently"" every 4th word, and it's more about her version of polarity energy work than stone massage.(which when done properly is 80% using stones as an extension of the MT's hands.)

There were a few moves that I found very invasive and wouldn't do, especially on someone who hadn't had massage before, one of which was placing stones on the sacrum, inside of the male models slacks. Even if this was acceptable she gives no alternative on what to do, should you get a woman wearing a dress?",1307836800,,759,4.5588235294117645
8309916,5,B001HWHSGO,"All we ever hear about ""Stone Massage"" is Hot Stones, Hot Stones.  One of the many things I learned in this video is that you must use hot AND cold to create the advantages of Thermalism.  I thought the information was presented in a professional manner with some very useful information.  I have studied Stone Massage for awhile and I learned a lot from this DVD.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who needs some fresh techniques and wants to learn from two people who know what they are doing.",1262131200,,499,4.450549450549451
