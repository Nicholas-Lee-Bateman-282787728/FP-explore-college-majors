8322418,3,B001MYIPZK,"THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS (2006) is a documentary dealing with numerous aspects of a catastrophic head injury suffered by Oakley Hall III in 1978. It is a very uneven film with some excellent parts, but it has far too many interviews of aging 5th-rate actors/actresses who are not too bright, not well informed, and much of the time not believable.

The editing is often poor, and the continuity is fuzzy at best. It seems that Bill Rose, the maker of the film, ended up with hours of footage that could be used to tell perhaps a dozen or more different stories, but he could not make up his mind which one to place in the foreground, which ones to make subordinate, and which others to eliminate ... so he jumped around and tried to do them all.

Among other stories, we get (1) the personal tragedy of Oakley Hall III; (2) the personal tragedy of his family (his wife, child, parents, and siblings); (3) the tragedy of society's supposed loss of a huge literary genius, cut down just as he was about to bloom into greatness; (4) the inspiring story of Oakley Hall III surviving a terrible brain injury and gradually recovering many of his mental functions; (5) the cautionary tale of an irresponsible community of youngish, twenty-something theater folks who abused their minds and bodies with excessive alcohol and various drugs before and after Oakley Hall was injured; (6) the cautionary tale of an irresponsible array of aging, fifty-something theater folks who misremember much of what occurred (or they never knew) and who in pretentious, self-aggrandizing ways ""invent"" stories about their past with Oakley Hall III; and (7) a polemical tale about how our society and most individuals are unwilling and/or unable to deal with and/or care for people whose brains are damaged.

Besides several of my life experiences as a Hospice Care volunteer, I am reminded of some other fact-based films that have dealt with people who have suffered the loss of some mental functions, usually due to schizophrenia, and how lucky or unlucky they were in receiving treatment and humane care from others. THE STORY OF ADELE H (1975) showed, among other things, that even a great genius like Victor Hugo was unable to do much when his adult child lost her mind. SHINE (1996) showed a talented musician suffering a disastrous nervous breakdown and, with luck and tenacity, achieving a comeback of sorts. A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) showed an undoubted genius, who with luck and ""proper care"" was able to regain parts of his mental function. THE SOLOIST (2008) showed another talented musician, again with luck, after many years of hardship, regaining some of what he'd lost. And A GUY CALLED DAD (2011) showed how a caring daughter was coping with her father's schizophrenia.

Significantly, in 2008 Bill Rose released a similar but far superior documentary about the life and death of Elizabeth Wiltsee, a brilliant woman with a 200 I.Q. and a huge talent for languages, who suffered a mental breakdown. Titled THIS DUST OF WORDS, it clearly shows how she became homeless because of her disability and how, decades later, she was mercifully ""adopted"" and cared for by a group Catholic women in a small California town for a short time before her death.

To return to THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS, like Victor Hugo, Hall's parents were unable to provide any intelligent care for their child after his fall from the bridge ... ditto his sisters. Some of the film's footage had interviews with them, probably done almost 20 years after his accident. And most of the other folks, chiefly actors Hall had worked with, were similarly useless as any sorts of caregivers or helpers in the years following his injury.

After his wife divorced him, however, Oakley Hall III was very lucky with the pair of women who served (not simultaneously but serially) as his caregivers while his brain mended somewhat. It truly WAS remarkable that Oakley Hall regained as much mental function as he did: in the footage presented, Hall is able to speak cogently and move in a ""normal looking"" way and has an excellent, educated vocabulary.

In my judgment, if I were giving this film a letter grade, it would be a ""C+"". Undoubtedly, a really good film could have been made about Oakley Hall, his injury, and its aftermath. It is too bad an editor with more experience or a more balanced view wasn't brought in to sort out the various threads of this documentary and discard the material that distracts viewers and detracts from its overall effect.

POSTSCRIPT: Throughout this documentary there is lots of f-word usage in the interviews, especially by two or three of the women, and there also are some clips from home movies with total nudity, male and female. It seems fair to mention these things in case your parents or your children would be bothered in any way by these factors while watching the film with you.",1386460800,3,4882,4.83133971291866
8322419,5,B001MYIPZK,"Brain injury/disease is a subject that I am becoming more and more familiar with. I have to children with MS, my daughter is advancing rapidly. You will not be disappointed with this film. I personally hope that something similar is created to promote awareness and funding for MS. Most people know little about the devastating disease, although they may think that they do.
Hope you do that Bill.

8322420,5,B001MYIPZK,"This is a harrowing cautionary tale. This is also moving tribute to the resilience of one man who teaches, by example, that there is life after ""death."" In fact, he teaches us that sometimes we have to ""die"" so that a new self, a better self, can emerge from the wreckage and make real miracles.

""The Loss of Nameless Things"" is the perfect title. It is a line of a play written by a man who has lost the memory of many nameless things, but was forced to recreate himself, in a new image, figuratively and literally, after a horrific accident. And if there's anything I did not like about this film--and there is almost nothing I didn't like about this film--it is the lamenting that he cannot create ""great art"" anymore.

HE is great art. He is his own greatest creation. And watching him disintegrate...and then put himself back together like a huge puzzle of thousands of pieces, and come out happy and constantly evolving, still...is the best work of art I've seen in a long time.

I was so glad that Oakley Hall III didn't just die or wander off one night and never come back or come to some other sad end after the tragic accident that put an end to that first career. I suppose those who knew him intimately do indeed miss the stunningly handsome young genius who might've become one of our greatest writers. I like the one with the crooked but still beautiful face who is living an even more beautiful story than that young genius could ever have written.

You need to see this. It is filled with hope and courage, and Oakley Hall III is someone I wish more people would take the time to meet. I'm glad I ""met"" him.",1371081600,9,1624,4.403333333333333
8322421,3,B001MYIPZK,"This is an interesting account that somehow reminds me of 'Waiting for Guffman' in the pretentious interviews and posturing about a playwright seriously injured in an accident! The bottom line is that it is about a group of self indulgent, and reckless hippy actors and the result of the self destructive bent that seems to plaque so many artistic people. A tragic story that could serve as a warning to anyone living on drugs and alcohol. Perhaps the fact that he understood, at last, what he had lost makes it more devastating. He is lucky that he found people who truly cared and wanted to help. Who knows what he might have been.",1330992000,8,633,4.610619469026549

8322423,5,B001MYIPZK,"Solid documentary about a fascinating subject -- playwright Oakley Hall III. Part Sam Shepard, part Orson Welles, part Jim Morrison-minus-the-histrionics, he was writing and staging daring (reportedly amazing) plays with his theater company in upstate New York during the 1970s, until a devastating head injury reorganized his face and scrambled his mind (an interview subject paraphrases a doctor's claim the accident essentially lobotomized him). What happens when a talented and charismatic figure, touched by apparent genius, is suddenly struck down and loses all of his gifts, yet doesn't die? Everything and nothing.",1309392000,11,622,5.771739130434782
