928954,5,6304753322,"I'd been waiting to see this movie for years (somehow it's never played on TV in the Chicagoland area), and after reading some of the other reviews here my expectations were high. I am not disappointed. 'Teenagers' starts off a little slow, but stick with it; the absurdities pile up steadily until the completely ludicrous finish causes your lower jaw to drop open in amazement. It actually gets better with each viewing. Some of my favorite cheese factors: the alien analyzer machine clearly labeled ""multichannel mixer""; the Fabio and Harry Chronic-lookalike aliens; the heroine's salacious hag of a girlfriend; the so-cliched-he's-brilliant TV newscaster; and the disorienting effect of hearing the 'scary' music cues from Night of the Living Dead in this context. Plus, whenever someone gets zapped, their skeleton is curiously held together with metal clips; the high-tech aliens are extremely dependent on human automobiles for getting around; and at bottom the story is really a soppy romance peopled with Mayberry and Mayfield refugees. All alien/hero Derek really wants is a home and family! And of course there's the Gargan; you have to admire their chutzpah and utter shamelessness in using the silhouette of a crayfish (not the actual crayfish mind you!) for their monster. There's something quite Ed Woodian about the whole thing; the naive enthusiasm of the cast, the non-sequitur dialogue, the poverty-stricken effects. Hour of fun for the bad movie connoisseur!
Ironically, Image's DVD presents the film in as pristine a state as could possibly be expected. The tonal values, sharpness, and detail are excellent, and you have to really watch closely to see any speckling or blemishing. The chapter stops are on the main menu, and a trailer for 'Teenagers' is included, as well as five of the same handful of trailers that are on other similar Image releases. Informative production notes are on the box. A solid entertainment value at the price.",1005436800,15,1962,5.192429022082019

928956,5,6304753322,"Tom Graeff's ""Teenagers From Outer Space"" is some kind of strange, perhaps accidental masterpiece. How did such a low-budget effort,using unknown (mostly untalented) actors wind up being so entertaining?
One big reason for this movie's 'success' is its pulp sci-fi look and feel. Watching it is like reading a 1950s sci-fi comic book, or like reading a sci-fi short story from the same period. The pulp look derives from the costumes and choice of locations used, as well as that of the monster ""Gargan"". A pulp feel results from the fast pace (actually rare in the sci-fi B-movie genre), some surprising violence, and the earnest, if inept, acting style.
A few scenes betray Tom Graeff's directorial talent: the laser gun attacks at the gas station, and especially, the unexpectedly effective car chase. These may frustrate some viewers; they suggest how much ""better"" the film might have been. But for some, they are balanced by the wonderfully comatose performance of the lead actor and the ludicrous spectacle of the ""Gargan"".
The DVD issue of ""Teenagers From Outer Space"" deserves a top recommendation. The film transfer is clear and rather impressive, the sound more than adequate. Inside the colorful keepcase there is a really informative essay. Another big plus is the collection of original trailers for other films in the B-Sci-Fi genre, most of which are in fine shape and--in some cases--are more interesting than the films themselves. Included here is, fortunately, the rarely seen trailer for ""Teenagers From Outer Space"": the wondrous film that includes NO teenage actors, but will entertain generations to come.",992390400,36,1628,5.193916349809886
928957,4,6304753322,"Derek, a rebel teenager from outer space, strays from his alien pack when he finds that the men of his saucer will release their herd of Gorgons (giant lobsters) on Earth, at the expense of human life.  Stumbling into town in his spacesuit, he quickly finds a room for rent (the landlord says he can just ""pay later"" if he doesn't have the cash immediately... try doing that in California nowadays).  Enter the ""bad"" (albeit really cute) teen alien, who attempts to recapture Derek and return him to his own world.
There are two scenes worthy of hearty praise in this fine film.
I was very fond of the scene in which Derek single-handedly fights the Gorgon (aka the giant lobster).  The lobsters - er, Gorgons - don't really crawl anywhere more than they seem to be held and shook off-screen; this was no doubt expertly performed by an imported British nanny.
Another superior scene is when the dishy, oversexed blonde in the swimming pool gives the ""teen"" alien Derek the up-and-down and invites him into the pool with her (and who wouldn't?).  This woman could have won an Oscar for this performance, particularly when she gets zapped by the alien's raygun and turns instantly into bones.  Now that's acting.  I doubt there are many, if any, actresses in Hollywood today who can turn into bones on demand like that.
But outside of the many meaningful performances one will find here can be found the unique aesthetic vision of the director.  It's here you'll find a world chock full of pomaded hair on cute '50s boys, great shots of vintage automobiles whizzing hither and tither, and giant alien crustaceans. And what a world it is -- sort of like a space-age, suburban Bali Hai, but located in the outskirts of Baltimore circa 1959.
I was so awed by this masterpiece that I created a cocktail for viewers to consume while watching the film.  It's called the Teenagers from Outer Space Cocktail, and is made up of: 1 cup pineapple juice, 1/3 cup coconut rum, and a dash of Blue Curacao.  Serve over ice, and garnish with a plastic lobster.",984268800,29,2042,4.665738161559888

I saw it one more time a few years ago on ""Mystery Science  Theater 3000"".

928959,2,6304753322,"To other aging baby-boomers out there, this trifle may stir memories of Saturday afternoons at the local picture-show (circa 1959).  The most laughable aspect of this movie is the lobster that keeps growing until it  becomes a giant shadow of a lobster.  We aren't even speaking of a Japanese  guy in a rubber monster-suit here.  The plot is simplistic and hokey.  Earth is invaded by aliens seeking grazing lands for their herds of space  cattle, which bear an uncanny resemblance to earth-bound lobsters.  There  is the obligatory ray-guns and guys running around in cheesy looking  space-suits. A dishy looking blonde woman in a swimming pool gets zapped by  a ray-gun and turned into a skeleton.  There's some low-budget special  effects from the 1950s showing plastic and cardboard spaceships.  If one  considers the corny dialogue, the bad acting, and the general low-budget  look, the whole movie can be taken as fun in a low-brow sort of way.  This  film remains on my personal list of the all-time ""so bad it's  good"" kind of movie. Proceed at you own risk.  And remember, everybody  watch the skies!",939168000,7,1109,4.918478260869565
928960,4,6304753322,This movie is a must see for anyone who masochistically enjoys 50s era B scifi movies.  Of course this movie is hideously bad but it lacks the inventiveness of other B flicks.

929059,3,6304753322,"Released in 1959, Teenagers from Outer Space chronicles a small group of English-speaking humanoid aliens who investigate Earth as a possible breeding ground for their staple food-supply, Gargans, which are essentially giant lobsters that stand vertical. One of the aliens, Derek (David Love), rebels against the others on the grounds that Earth is inhabited by intelligent humanoid beings. Dawn Bender plays Dereks possible romantic interest while Bryan Grant plays Thor, a particularly malevolent alien.

If you can ignore the lameness of the non-special effects and overdone or underdone melodrama, the story is well done in ways and Derek & Dawn are likable protagonists. The movies also worthwhile simply as a historical artifact to observe American society in the late 50s. However, compared to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and the monumental Forbidden Planet (1956) Teenagers from Outer Space is dissatisfactory and cheesy, not to mention the title is dumb and disingenuous. It cant even compare to 1958s I Married a Monster from Outer Space (another dumb title, but at least its accurate). The flicks worth checking out though for the positive items noted.

The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California.

929121,1,6304753322,"Despite having known of this film's existence for 4 decades, I had never, ever seen it on tv. So when I just recently saw it was available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, I was eager to see the film. Well, I have seen it and I can confidently say it is one of those 'so bad it's good' types of movie, like Plan 9 from Outer Space or Robot Monster. Yes, this film is really, really bad.
First of all, the guys from outer space don't seem to be young enough to be teenagers. some are not even close. The acting is quite stilted throughout. And the film is obviously very low budget. The weapon of the spacemen is a disintegrator pistol that vaporize flesh but leaves the bone. Well, every time they use it on a person, it leaves a skeleton on which you can see the metal hook coming out of the skull, which is put there to hang the skelly by! The filmmakers just took a skeleton from a science display and used it without even taking the hook out!  Another very cheap thing is that they use the shadow of a real lobster to represent the film's horrible monster (called the Gargan, I guess short for gargantuan).

In summary, it's worth seeing once just t see how bad it is.",1437523200,,1170,4.21875

929124,5,6304753322,"I almost hate to admit that I loved this bizarre movie.
The story involves a space craft landing on Earth.  Aliens keep climbing out of it like clowns out of a tiny car.  One of them immediately goes AWOL when he realizes his dog killing companions don't care a fig if this planet is inhabited.  They want to farm and need land lots of land and won't be fenced in.  They have gargons to raise and graze.  So what if a few ""foreign beings"" get in the way.  They are THE supreme race and obviously more important.  And they can't have a blabbermouth running all over creation saying who knows what to the first pretty human girl he meets.  ""Go!  Be swift!""  Kill or capture, preferably kill the miserable deserter and be quick about it.  Along the way, a few people are deboned in a most uncivilized manner.  People soon realize there is ""an insane killer"" on the loose.  He's a quick draw with an itchy trigger finger.  ""One sudden move and I will slay you both!""

Oddly enough, this crappy movie is really quite exciting and not a little endearing albeit in a clumsy fashion.  You can't hardly imagine what they're going to say or do next.
It's amazing what you can do with no money and no talent.  Every member of the cast is very formal and unnatural.  And while I can understand the aliens acting robotic, the less than human humans is bit difficult to comprehend.
This film was almost singlehandedly made by Tom Graeff (who also played ace reporter Joe Rogers).  He wrote, directed, produced, edited, filmed, and supplied the music.  Sadly, Tom Graeff didn't survive his Hollywood experience.  He committed suicide on Dec. 19, 1970 at the age of 41.  This film is his legacy.",1430179200,,1679,4.526666666666666

And while, yes, you might find some humor in how bad this movie is if you happen to be in the right mood, that doesn't change the fact that it is bad ... bad ... bad. The writing is predictable, the acting is as wooden as you can find (in EVERY role), the fake beards are insanely obvious, and lots of things just don't make sense ... starting with the gobbledygook technical talk spouting from the mouths of the aliens.

When one of them kills a dog early on, turning it into a skeleton, the skeleton is obviously from a much smaller animal than the dog. LOL When a fleet of spaceships fills the sky, what WE see are people staring upwards and over-emoting surprise. The hatch of the spaceship we DO see appears to have been adapted from a large washtub that has been beaten around for years. I could go on and on.

929185,3,6304753322,"Directed, produced, copyrighted, and acted by Tom Graeff. He plays a minor role in this cheap sf film from 1959. The title is completely inappropriate as the actors look to be in their 30s. The acting is stiff and the dialogue is delivered in a monotone. There are no special effects. The alien is a shadowy lobster kept off screen. While the aliens who landed do disintegrate a dog named Sparky, I don't think this is the movie I remember watching decades ago in which an alien in a space suit and helmet walked around and zapped a few humans then a dog, all turned into skeletons. In Teenagers from Outer Space it is one alien, not in a space suit who peers out of the saucer and shoots a dog. It just feels to me to be a different film.
  However, the film is not too bad. Low key. A scenario of missed opportunities, missed meetings, and cross-purposes. Has a romance, one of the few 1950s movies in which an alien romances a human woman. This film has one sympathetic alien who commits treason by disobedience to the coldly rational aliens. He has empathy to the humans and wants to live with them. He is chased by a crewman who is very trigger happy until he is injured by bullets. There is character development among the aliens, they do learn better. Even the character Thor changes. But why is the romantically inclined alien named Derek? Too ordinary. In the end, Derek sacrifices himself and all the other aliens by directing the alien fleet to crash land, destroying all, including the leader.
  It is implied that with the death of the leader there will be a revolution by people reading that book Derek had -- a book that creates emotions when read and makes them more human, and so reject the excessively regimented, rationalist society that the aliens had until then. The society faintly reminds me of Brave New World, in which people are bred in communities, with no nuclear family structure.
  The film lacks the tension and paranoia of other alien invasion films of that era, and instead deals with a symbolic alienation of a person. Perhaps with a gay subtext.. Here aliens are outsiders and not exactly the enemy.
  The film also reminds me of Starman and The Man Who Fell to Earth. The alien wants to stay on Earth. Also like The Day the Earth Stood Still, it has a sympathetic alien character.

929275,3,6304753322,"This movie is a classic B-movie.  The acting is almost bad, the monster special effects are awful, and yet there are some moments of charm.

Down from outer space come aliens.  These 1959 aliens are far superior to humans and are prepared to use earth as a grazing ground for their gargon herds.  We debated whether gargons were crawfish or lobsters when watching the movie.  Several sources indicate it was a lobster.  In either case, I feel sorry for the poor lobster, which looked like it was trying to escape from the movie each time it appeared.

Anyway, one of the aliens thinks there might be intelligent life on earth (was he ever mistaken), and counsels that perhaps they should not use earth as a gargon grazing ground.  When the others try to restrain him, Derek (David Love, in his second and final film role) escapes, and eventually encounters teeny-bopper Betty Morgan (Dawn Bender aka Dawn Anderson, in her final film role), who immediately likes him.  Alien ship mate Thor (Bryan Grant, whose career includes four roles, with the last being on ""Daniel Boone"" in 1968), is soon on the trail of Derek with the intent of bringing him back.  The rest of the movie becomes one long chase scene between Thor and Derek, with Thor killing regularly, apparently because he finds killing to be expeditious, or fun, or both.

One of the things I found endlessly fascinating is that Betty was no wall flower.  Derek and several others kept telling Betty to stay put, and she kept doing the exact opposite.  I am sure that Betty became a leader in the women's liberation movement in the 60s.  On the other hand, Betty generally kept her wits about her, even when she was running into harm's way.  Indeed, it was Betty's quick thinking that enabled powering of the alien ray gun (which consists of a body surrounding a flashlight, it appears) when she and Derek were fending off the lobster shadow.

Eventually we arrive at the end of the movie with the typical ""surprise"" ending, which has a bit of a nice moral to it.  What was really surprising is that this movie is actually okay.  The 50s were a great decade for made for drive-in movies, and this one clearly had that feel.  I can almost imagine people just a bit younger than my parents necking while watching this movie as the second movie of a triple feature at a drive-in.  The worst part of the movie is the lobster, followed by the hammy acting of Thor.  Other than that, the movie had a nicely paced plot, with a couple of decent car chases, and the spaceship effects were interesting and, to my knowledge, unique.

929349,3,6304753322,"Definitely a ""so bad it's good"" sci-fi treat, especially for B film fans.  We start off at an observatory with a young man and a professor with the fakest goatee ever.  The young man says he thought he saw something but it must have been his imagination.  He then goes off on a philosophical rant about us being alone in space like a piece of food floating in the ocean.

We never see them again and it has nothing to do with the plot, but we're moving along.

These guys land in what is a saucer and parttime drill bit.  It drills into the earth and up pops the hatch.  There are so many guys that come out that you have to wonder how much space is in this thing.  They are all wearing what look like Air Force surplus jet pilot masks.  One guy spots this cute little dog and ray guns him down.

The dog (a.k.a. ""sparky"", get it?) becomes a pile of bones.  Clack!

So these guys come out and set up their equipment, which looks like stuff from a ham radio operator's attic, complete with English language dials and knobs.  They test the air and find that this planet will be ideal for the raising of their herds of giant Lobsters for their race's food supply.  If the lobsters overrun and kill everybody, so what?

One guy, our star Derrick (played by David Love) says no, tries to force them at gun point to get back in the saucer but they overpower him.

He escapes:  to 1950s suburbia!  The Horror!

The first part of the movie is basically one of the spacemen, Thor, chasing Derrick.  As Thor rayguns several people and becomes the media darling of the airwaves as he leaves skeletons in his wake (turns out the same skeleton was used over and over.  Low budget deluxe), Derrick makes friends with the locals.

The Grandpa is the worst actor ever.  Really hams it up.  But I digress.

The smaller part of the film has the giant lobster thingee go on a rampage.  He cannot be killed except by Derrick's Flash Gordon raygun, which of course does not work at the last second.  Oops.

Reminiscent of Star Trek, Derrick finds that enough power from the power poles could generate his ray gun to work.  So he hooks up the raygun to the power poles (somehow not getting a shock) but there's not enough power.  Betty calls the power company who believes her story about a giant monster and they need more power for the ray gun, turns up the juice.  She yells, ""More power, we need more power!""

Where's Scotty when you need him?

The self-sacrifice at the end is a bit of a let-down, mainly due to the low budget and a lot of smoke.

Overall, entertaining.  If director Tom Graeff had a bit more  money he could have made quite the impression at the box office.  This film was parodied on Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1249171200,3,2715,4.347305389221557

I think the most astonishing thing was that the actors were able to deliver the utterly awful, melodramatic, stilted, expository, forced dialog without dissolving into laughter. But they never crack a smile. Maybe they really were aliens... or maybe they knew this was the end of all their careers.

In short, you absolutely have to go into this film with the understanding that laughing at it is the only way you'll get through it with your sanity intact.

TEENAGERS is a strange film; a labor of love with flashes of real talent and ingenuity between the easy-laugh fodder of toy zap-guns and giant lobsters. Its earnest, heart-on-its-sleeve nature is what really makes it a target for today's jaded, cynical audiences.
The movies' ace, however, is Dawn Bender(aka Dawn Anderson) as ""Betty""... is there any male viewer out there who doesn't have a thing for her?

Derek befriends a hot chick named Betty and her grandfather and attempts to live a peaceful earth life.  That's quickly shattered by one alien called Thor who stayed behind to find and capture Derek.  Thor goes on a rampage trying to find Derek, killing everybody who gets in his way.

Derek is now caught in a pickle as he has to stop the monster and the forthcoming invasion, but now has feelings for Betty and is quite eager to learn the many wonderous delights of the human female.

An all-male, teenage crew of aliens land on earth to see if they can grow their cattle, a creature they call ""gargons,"" on it.  When good-boy alien Derek (David Love) realizes the planet is inhabited, he takes off to warn the earthlings, with bad-boy alien Thor (Bryan Grant) in hot pursuit.  Both meet a lot really bad actors, including Dawn Anderson and Harvey B. Dunn, and Thor reduces several of them to skeletons clearly borrowed from a high school science lab for cinematic purposes.  In the mean time, the test-case gargon grows and grows to man-eating size, and we are startled to realize that it is actually a really big lobster--or, more accurately speaking, the really big shadow of a regular sized lobster used in the hope that viewers will be terrorized.

Ah, no, not really.  There are lots of horrendous things going on here, and some of them may actually make you close your eyes, but if you do it will be more out of embarassment for the players than out of fear.  Yes, it really is that bad, and it is dosed up with some truly uninspired Cold War allegory for good measure.  The whole thing is impossibly dire, and you are in the right frame of mind it can actually be extremely entertaining in a sort of sado-maschochistic kinda way.  Drug use would probably also help.

The film quality is very ify.  The contrast is atrocious and the first few scenes are riddled with artifacts, and while both issues get a bit better as the movie progresses they are never really resolved.  And let's be honest: this isn't a quality product, so it probably never looked all that great even in its first run.  Recommended, but only if you have a taste for the worst of the worst in late 1950s B movies; all others will likely find it so cringe worthy that they can't get past the first few minutes.

929357,3,6304753322,"Actually, this movie is not as bad as I remembered it. But there are a lot of issues.

To start with,I guess you would have had to have lived through the fifties to understand the significance of the title. At that time, the word ""teenager"" was actually synonymous with ""juvenile Delinquent"" or the modern term ""gangster"". Normal people of that age were ""youths"", ""young adults"" or some other neutral term. ""Teenagers"" were hormone-driven bundles of rage and rebellion. To imagine such recklessly destructive persons equipped with alien weapons capable of mass destruction was to trigger every parents darkest nightmare.

The story line is pretty thoughtful.  We have an alien civilization which is what might have happened if Hitler or Stalin had taken over the world. Children are raised in farms and never know their parents, except for those of high party members, who are not told until maturity.

The main food source for this civilisation is the gargon, a crustacean-like creature which eats anything or anyone that it can catch and being quite huge, it can catch just about anything.

In the opening a scout ship from this civilition lands near an American town. It is crewed by one adult and two teenaged helpers. Their mission is to place a specimen of gargon on Earth to see if it will prosper there.  One of the teenagers detects signs of human life and argues against planting the voracious gargons here.  He is apparently a member of an underground working against the oppressive government.  The other teenager can best be described as a Hitler Youth with ambitions of becoming an SS thug. The good teen is threatened with arrest and runs away. The adult leader then reveals that he is really the son of the Party Leader and must be brought home safely. A small gargon is left in an abandoned mine and the vicious teen is left behind to hunt down and arrest the escapee. The next act of the movie sees the good teen becoming more and more fond of Earth's way of life, while the vicious teen hunts for him, leaving a trail of bodies reduced to skeletons by his ray gun. The vicious teen is eventually captured and his ray gun damaged.

Meanwhile, the gargon has grown huge and broken loose from the mine. It is now roaming the countryside, killing everything and everybody in sight.  The good teen struggles to repair the ray gun and finally, using power from a high voltage line, uses it to destroy the gargon.

The scout ship returns bringing the Party Leader intent on recovering his son, and leading a fleet of ships carrying large packs of gargons to be released on Earth.

The good teen seizes control of the scout ship's radio and causes the whole fleet to crash on him, killing the evil teen, the Party Leader, all of the gargons, and himself.  By his sacrifice, he saves the Earth and opens the way for revolution on his homeworld.

I think that the reason that this movie hangs on as a cult favorite is that it really is a good basic story. With a good script and and a more experienced director, as well as a good budget for special effects, this could have been a classic.  the cast and crew did the best they could with the resources available to them, but those resources were limited and it shows in the finished product. The main complaint, as it is with so many of these low budget movies is wooden acting. A good script writer would have given them the language to express the concepts they were clearly trying to explore, and a good director would have guided them in better ways to perform the lines.  Budget enters in too, since they clearly could not afford the film needed to repeat unsuccessful takes.

Bad marks for special effects. The ray gun is clearly a flashlight with a fancy pistol grip and a few useless decorations.  But the worst effect is the gargon. It is clearly the shadow of a half dead lobster superimposed over the screen. In the hands of a good stop action animator it would have been a prize-winning effect, but that would have cost more than three times the whole budget for the movie.  Such animation is expensive and time consuming.

we really should give good marks for costume. The Alien uniforms really look authentic down to the white footgear.

The fact that TFOS has a cult audience nearly 50 years later is a testament to the fact that there's something more at work here than an average B-flick.

929475,3,6304753322,"This movie is a classic B-movie.  The acting is almost bad, the monster special effects are awful, and yet there are some moments of charm.

Down from outer space come aliens.  These 1959 aliens are far superior to humans and are prepared to use earth as a grazing ground for their gargon herds.  We debated whether gargons were crawfish or lobsters when watching the movie.  Several sources indicate it was a lobster.  In either case, I feel sorry for the poor lobster, which looked like it was trying to escape from the movie each time it appeared.

Anyway, one of the aliens thinks there might be intelligent life on earth (was he ever mistaken), and counsels that perhaps they should not use earth as a gargon grazing ground.  When the other try to restrain him, Derek (David Love) escapes, and eventually encounters teeny-bopper Betty Morgan (Dawn Bender aka Dawn Anderson), who immediately likes him.  Alien ship mate Thor (Bryan Grant), is soon on the trail of Derek with the intent of bringing him back.  The rest of the movie becomes one long chase scene between Thor and Derek, with Thor killing regularly, apparently because he finds killing to be expeditious, or fun, or both.

One of the things I found endlessly fascinating is that Betty was no wall flower.  Derek and several others kept telling Betty to stay put, and she kept doing the exact opposite.  I am sure that Betty became a leader in the women's liberation movement in the 60s.  On the other hand, Betty generally kept her wits about her, even when she was running into harm's way.

Eventually we arrive at the end of the movie with the typical ""surprise"" ending of the movie, which had a bit of a nice moral to it.  What was really surprising is that this movie is actually okay.  The 50s were a great decade for made for drive-in movies, and this one clearly had that feel.  I can almost imagine people just a bit younger than my parents necking while watching this movie as the second movie of a triple feature at a drive-in.  The worst part of the movie is the lobster, followed by the hammy acting of Thor.  Other than that, the movie had a nicely paced plot, with a couple of decent car chases, and the spaceship effects were interesting and, to my knowledge, unique.

However, Derek, a crew member has been reading a book which has warped his mind. He disagrees with his 'master race's' way of doing things. He wants families and love, not cold hearted beings grown in incubators. After a dog is disintegrated, he escapes from his crew and uses the dog tag to trace down it's owner. Here he meets Betty and the kindly, always ready to give any information to anybody, grandpa.

Thor will have none of this and chases down Derek. He must be taken dead or alive even though he is the son of the Leader. Derek doesn't know this, but the crew received these orders from the leader himself.

Derek is a kind hearted alien who loves earth and it's way of life. He longs for love and compassion, which is almost unknown to his people.

Thor: You must take these metal pellets out of me.

Derek : That's impossible!

Betty: I know a doctor. We can take you there.

Thor: She is very wise.

As I watched the plot lurch from one unlikely scene to another, I could see that this film was really a love movie set against a few scenes of stark power. The car chase scenes stand out as well as the tenderness that Derek and his human romantic lead showed.

He can't agree with them that the humans on planet earth are nothing more than food for the hideous ""Gargon"", the  lobster-monsters they plan on introducing to our unsuspecting world. Derek rebels, causing his comrades to hunt him down. Along the way, we are introduced to Betty (Dawn Bender) and Gramps (Harvey B. ""Bride Of The Monster"" Dunn) who rent Derek a room in their home. Unbeknownst to them, one of Derek's cohorts, named Thor, is on Derek's trail. He's busy blasting people right and left with a death-ray, skeletonizing them on the spot! Check out the babe in the swimming pool (Betty's friend). Watch as she's turned into a stack of bones before our eyes! Can Derek escape his shipmates? Can he save the earth from becoming one gigantic lobster ranch?? Watch and find out! Worth having just to hear Derek's kermit-the-frog voice! TFOS was written, produced, and directed by Tom Graeff, who also appears in the movie as Joe (under the name Tom Lockyear) the local reporter! I like this one a lot for some strange reason. I can watch it over and over without getting bored ...",1094688000,3,1181,4.733009708737864
929480,1,6304753322,"Don't let the rating fool you.  This may be one of the worst movies ever made, but it is also, unquestionably, one of the funniest!  In this ridiculous sci-fi horror flick, everything is atrocious: the script, the acting, not to mention the special effects.  Who could forget the film's ""monster"" being nothing more than a siloutte of a lobster!  One of my favorite effects are the flesh tearing ray guns the aliens use and leave nothing but the victim's skeleton (in one scene the editing is so bad that you can actually see the metal screws holding the prop together!)  Fans of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", ""Attack of the 50 Foot Tall Woman"", ""Eegah"", and ""The Creeping Terror"" will get a kick out of this film.  It is a staple at ""All Time Worst Movies"" conventions.  Don't hesitate to rent this one.  It is a riot!",1086566400,5,816,4.503401360544218

7877607,5,6304753322,"An under rated classic !  Plays out more of a horror movie witch sets it apart from other sci fi classics with a death count that makes any Friday the 13th movie proud ! Very dark for its time but very well written !
You cant but help fall in love with the girl powered teenager Betty (the wonderfull dawn bender )
Paves the way for other great strong woman leads in sci fi roles like Sigourney Weaver and Milla Jovovich .
This is truly a fun and fast paced movie with a tad of humor at just the right parts. With interesting characters . Derrick ,joe and graps . To name a few. Under neath the camp lye's an important thought . Are world is just a spec of sand in a ocean . Who knows what can overtake are planet at anytime ?",1502323200,,726,4.006896551724138

Betty doesn't do a darn thing she's told, you would be better off telling her what you didn't want her to do. :) Better than average 50s B movie.",1491264000,,273,4.169811320754717
