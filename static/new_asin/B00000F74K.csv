7907817,1,B00000F74K,"The last reviewer is obviously joking. I borrowed this tape from a friend once (thank goodness I didn't pay for it). I have seen hundreds of films in my 40+ years, and this is quite possibly the all-time worst. There is nothing good about this film. The acting is horrible, the story is lame, the characters are ridiculous and unbelievable, even the sex scenes are weak. The fight scenes are even worse. The only reason to watch this movie is to learn how not to make a film. I would have given this 0 stars if I could.",1128211200,,519,4.3061224489795915
7907818,5,B00000F74K,"Eric Wilde is one tough dude. He's a pistol that's always cocked! This movie changed the life of my Lesbian Jewish Albanian family more than any other Ginger Lynne movie did. It had it all feminism, spirituality, morality, the kabbalah and one f*ckin' hot orgy!  Don Scribner in his Academy Award winning role of Eric Wilde will have you praying this mutha' doesn't come looking for you.
Do yourself a favor and buy this movie now! Anything else is mild, man.",1084492800,,459,4.666666666666667
