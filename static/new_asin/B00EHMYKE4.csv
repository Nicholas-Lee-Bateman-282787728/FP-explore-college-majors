BATTLEGROUND 2013

This was the first ever Battleground event and I was actually happy that they came with a new name. It has been a while since they have done, the last was Capital Punishment I believe.

Spoilers

1.[HARDCORE WORLD TITLE MATCH]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS RVD-very tough match to kick off the event with a rematch from Night of Champions. This was more RVDs style so it seemed he was the favorite here. There are various highlights and spots during this match and Ricardo gets involved at one point. In the end Del Rio actually got the submission here with the cross arm breaker. This was a great opening match.

2. THE REAL AMERICANS VS ANTINO MARELLA & THE GREAT KHALI-this was a good tag match that was meant to put over the Real Americans. The action is good and the match is short but it is the ending that most will remember. Cesaro displays so power here that the crowd loves and leads to the victory for the Real Americans.

3.[I-C TITLE]CURTIS AXEL VS R TRUTH-this was a good match in which I fell Truth looked the strongest and got over well. Axel did well as well and kept the belt but Truth looked very good here. This was not the best match on the card but it was a good one over all.

4.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS BREE BELLA-this was your typical Divas match with AJ continuing her quest to get rid of the Total Divas show. This was a decent bout between the two that would see Tamina get involved. AJ keeps the belt as most of us thought she would.

5. ROMAN REIGNS & SETH ROLLINS VS GOLDUST & CODY RHODES-this was the match I was most looking forward to. I am a big fan of all these guys so I was all about this one right here. Dusty was in his boys corner while Rollins & Reigns had Dean Ambrose of course. In my opinion this was the best match of the night. From the in ring action to the fan response. The Rhodes family was fighting to keep their jobs so this was an emotional match that the fans really got behind. All six guys were excellent here with Dean and Dusty getting in on the action. This was a fast paced encounter that would see the crowd explode when Cody got the pin over Rollins.

6. BRAY WYATT VS KOFI KINGSTON-this was a match that was added on Smackdown and I was all about that. I really am enjoying the Wyatt Family and Bray in particular. This is a good match with Kofi utilizing his quickness. But when Bray gets a hold of him he uses his size to his advantage. After a good but short match Bray picks up the win, also I love his entrance every time.

7. CM PUNK VS RYBACK-this match came about after Ryback saved Heyman at Night of Champions. This was a physical one from the start with Punk being relentless with his attacks. Of course Ryback is a powerhouse and it showed here. Then of course when you have Heyman on the outside you know he is getting involved somehow. This one of the best matches these two have had together regardless of how the crowd reacts to Ryback. Punk gets the win after delivering a low blow, Ryback tasting his own medicine maybe.

8.[WWE TITLE]DANIEL BRYAN VS RANDY ORTON-this was a good match much like their last one at Night of Champions. I say this a lot but the action was back and forth which makes for a good pace. Both guys deliver here as there are several memorable moments but know as much as that ending. The Big Show makes his way down and just KOs everybody here.

BONUS

1. GOLDUST, CODY RHODES & DANIEL BRYAN VS THE SHIELD-this was a good match from RAW that overall was fun. I love all these guys and they all delivered. The match ended at one as a DQ win for the Rhodes boys and Bryan but Triple H restarted it. The match last only minutes afterwards with The Shield getting the win. Afterwards the brawl would start which would lead to Big Show coming out and knocking Hunter out.

You get an interview with RVD after his title match as well as interviews with Randy and Daniel. Then you get an interview with Big Show the next night on RAW. This was a good event with some good matches, particularly the tag match with The Shield and the Rhodes family.",1384905600,3,4054,4.283660130718954
5914983,3,B00EHMYKE4,"It should be noted that WWE started their annual ""Rise Above Cancer"" campaign with the Susan G. Komen foundation so you saw the pink ribbon on various places around the stage & ring area including the middle rope being pink along with talents wearing their pink-themed t-shirts throughout the night.

Hardcore Match: World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Rob Van Dam - This started out with a bang as you saw RVD utilize his surroundings such as a moonsault off the barricade & springboard DDT into the ring on a chair all within the opening minute only for Del Rio to come back with chairshots & one impactful backstabber before taking hard shots with a trash can to his back as a receipt.  A ladder came into play throughout the match such as either being whipped into it in the corner or it being dropkicked into their face while it worked both good & bad for RVD when using it to add more impact to his trademark offense as he resorted to sacrificing himself using the ladder just to hurt Del Rio while Ricardo also got involved at one point before Del Rio took advantage of a chair in the ring to his advantage including using it to deliver one of the most painful cross armbreakers ever seen.  While this match was pushed to work towards RVD's advantage, Del Rio was no stranger to these types of matches himself (various Ladder & Last Man Standing matches in his career) so they worked well here in what I feel is their best match against each other with some of the shots coming off very stiff.

Santino Marella & Great Khali vs. Real Americans - Swagger started off very aggressive kept knocking Santino & even going after Hornswoggle's cobra as him & Cesaro continued to work him over in the corner keeping him away from Khali in the corner with double teaming tactics before Khali eventually made the tag only for them to take him down & Cesaro showcasing his strength in a way that not only resulted in the crowd getting behind him but also had it replayed throughout the night because it was so impressive.  This was a good display for Swagger & Cesaro but all about building to that one spot he did with Khali towards the end.

Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel vs. R-Truth - Truth was very dominate early win with punches around the ring & in the corner before Axel was able take advantage of his surroundings on the outside & connected with forearms to the chest as they traded momentum such as both delievering dropkicks, Truth's trademark axe kick, and Axel once again taking advantage of his surroundings to work in his favor.  I'll give credit in that Truth looked the most motivated I've seen him in his heel run with his match being solid but nothing special.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Bree Bella - Bree's sister Nikki was in her corner while A.J. had her new bodyguard in Tamina Snuka who came into play every early when Bree was dominate only for A.J. to run & hide behind her which allowed an opening for A.J. to heavily work over Bree's arm with stretches & using the ring environment around her while Bree attempted to use her feet with high & low dropkicks.  Bree is still very limited in what she can do while A.J. is at the top of her game right now so this was as good as it could be with the story they told in the ring & along with further establishing the ""Shawn/Diesel"" relationship between A.J. & Tamina.

Cody Rhodes & Goldust vs. The Shield - The stipulations for this were high as both Cody & Dustin would be reinstated into WWE if they won but remain unemployed with Dusty Rhodes also losing his job in NXT if they lose while both Dusty & Dean Ambrose were in the corners of their teams.  The Rhodes were very dominate in the early going as The Shield just couldn't get any momentum in their direction even when Dean tried to get involved leading to all 6 men facing off on the outside but The Shield was able to resort to their ""vintage"" tag team strategy of isolating one man & heavily working him over as each member of the Rhodes was put into the position throughout the match before we saw some offense that we normally don't see from either Cody or Goldust including the Alabama Slam, moonsault, and a twisting crossbody while Dusty was able to get ""funky like a monkey"" on Ambrose.  This was definitely an emotional match seeing how this is the first time that all three Rhodes were involved together in a match & told the story perfectly of them fighting for a cause as Cody was hot, this was the most I've seen Goldust motivated compared to his time in WWE before this while The Shield were on their game as usual.

Kofi Kingston vs. Bray Wyatt - After Bray easily laughing off the early offense, Kofi kept the strategy of trying to ""stick & move"" with his kicks & later forearms while Bray was able to eventually keep catching & keeping him grounded along with playing mind games such walking towards Kofi as if it was a scene from ""The Exorcist"" at one point.  This was a solid match that did it's job.

C.M. Punk vs. Ryback - Punk came out hot going after Ryback with his kicks in the ring while doing a suicide dive onto the outside but eventually Ryback was able to catch Punk in mid-offense using his power to dominate with moves from a belly to belly throw to powerbomb to powerslam as he kept powering Punk down or had Heyman cause a distraction whenever Punk attempted to gain back some momentum however Punk kept relying on his feet for various kicks & head scissors while also delievering some big moves of his own like his top rope elbow drop before it eventually came down to one man beating the other man at his own game.  This was one match was definitely better than their entire series a year earlier as this was a physical match telling the story of ""finesse vs. power.""

This will probably be edited off of the DVD release but just for the records that it was around here that the power outtage happened that caused the PPV to be delayed for a couple of minutes.

WWE Championship Match: Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton - Both men started out this encounter evenly match from Bryan's side headlock down & Orton countering it into his own to both men working over the other's arm with yanks & twist with Orton working over Bryan with moves like a crotching him on the top rope & headbutts keeping a very slow methodical pace while Bryan kept the momentum fast with moves like taking Orton over the top rope head scissors takedown & suicide dive resulting in Orton picking the pace himself in a more aggressive manner catching Bryan into a powerbomb & bouncing Bryan's head against anything in sight on the outside while Bryan matched the aggressiveness with various kicks including a knockout one straight to the head as both men continued to take the fight to each other both in & out of the ring delivering & taking big impact moves from Orton's suplex over the top to the floor to Bryan's top rope crossbody to Bryan's top rope headbutt to Orton's hanging DDT.  This match was a mixed bag as I felt it was a better encounter than their previous PPV match however the finish didn't deliver what was advertised for this PPV & ultimately just served the purpose of pushing someone else's storyline.

WWE for some reason usually always insist on cramming 3 PPVs into a 2 month period around this time of year which always results in one of them being nothing more than a paid edition of ""RAW/SmackDown"" which is the case here as they did give you some good in-ring action but there's nothing relevant on this show that you either didn't already see before or after this PPV on free TV making this one of those events where nothing of relevance happened so I would only recommend if you want to just add this to your collection for the in-ring action but can be easily skipped past that.",1382486400,4,7753,4.469589816124469
5914984,3,B00EHMYKE4,"The Hardcore rules match for the Worlds title match between Alberto Del Rio & Rob Van Dam was a extreme,smash-mouth & fun brawl. The tag team match between The Real Americans(Jack Swagger & Antonio Cesaro) against the team of The Great Khali & Santino Marella was seven minutes of filler with only Cesaro's big swing on Great Khali being the memorable thing about this bout. The Intercontinental title match between Curtis Axel & R-Truth was average to say the least. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Brie Bella was not great but pretty good. The Shield(Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins)-Cody Rhodes/Goldust tag team match was an excellent,personal tag bout. The Bray Watt-Kofi Kingston match was just filler that just went too long and it was only on for 8 minutes. The CM Punk-Ryback match was solid,personal battle even with the weak finish. The Randy Orton-Daniel Bryan match for the vacated WWE title was a back-and-forth,hard-hitting bout until the dumb Big Show rampage ending ruined it. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1381363200,3,1026,4.8352272727272725
5914985,2,B00EHMYKE4,"Preshow match: Ziggler vs Sandow: Sandow hurt his knee and Ziggler won with the Zig Zag is all I remember.

  Alberto vs RVD: RVD lost with the armbar with his arm between a steal chair. RVD, should have won, but the belt is probably reserved for Sheamus when he returns.

  Santino and Khali vs The All Americans: Yes this was a ppv match, but a Ziggler match wasn't. The only reason to see this one is that Cesaro spun Khali around by his legs and then pinned him. Cesaro deserves a big push, he's wasted in this tag team.

  R-Truth vs Curtis Axel (IC title): Pretty boring match that could have been and should been free on Raw, MainEvent or Smackdown. Axel won with his finisher is all I remember.

  Brie Bella vs AJ Lee (Diva's Title): AJ was out with Tamina Snuka ""or whatever her name is"" and she caused a distraction by attacking Nikki Bella and AJ got a roll up for the win.

  Goldust and Cody w/Dusty Rhodes vs the Shield w/Dean Ambrose: In probably the best, if not the only good moment of the night, Cody and Goldust won. Dusty took out Dean with some bionic elbows ""lol"" and hits with his belt and Goldust took out Reigns. Cody was left in the ring with Rollins and won with the Cross Rhodes.

  Ryback w/Heyman vs CM Punk: Just remember Punk hitting Ryback with a low kick to the groin when Heyman distracted the ref by trying to hit Punk with a kendo stick. Punk then got the pin after the low blow.
Is nice that Punk finally got a win at a ppv since it has been months, but this match wasn't that great.

  Orton vs Bryan (WWE Title): Bryan is over and should of had a long reign after Night of Champions. The fact that he was even stripped of the title, Vince Russo or Bischoff style, annoyed me too much to want to see another Orton and Bryan match. The ending sucked too since Big Show came out and knocked out both men and it ended like that with no new champ.
  Since the WWE has no idea what to do with a face that's over who isn't Cena, they either turn him heel or job him. Either one could happen to Bryan when boring Cena returns.",1381104000,2,2059,4.183206106870229

8605359,3,B00EHMYKE4,"I've seen this event called the worst of 2013, and--although it's no great shakes--I can't agree. Every year, the WWE choses to wedge a PPV into a two week turn around between other, more established PPVs. In 2012, No Way Out was sandwiched tightly between Over The Limit and Money in the Bank. In 2014, Battleground was snug between Money in the Bank and SummerSlam. In 2011, it was Vengeance. These events seem forgotten and, with the exception of one or two matches, pretty much irrelevant.

Not Worth Watching: The Real Americans squashed Santino Marella and the Great Khali in a match only notable for Cesaro's Giant Swing, Brie Bella challenged AJ for the Divas Title, R-Truth vied for the Intercontinental Title against  Curtis Axel, and CM Punk had a very lax match with Ryback.

Worth Watching: Alberto Del Rio and RVD had a very good Hardcore Match for the World Title and--despite the awful ending with The Big Show--Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton had a much better match for the vacant WWE Title than they put forth the month before at Night of Champions.

Match of the Night: The Shield and The Rhodes Brothers has an excellent tag team match with the entire Rhodes Family's jobs and WWE future on the line. I loved this match and I think this was the start of an unfortunately short boom period for tag team wrestling.

Despite only having three worthwhile matches, Battleground gave us two excellent undercard bouts and a reasonably good main event that drag it from being amongst the absolute worst events of the year. I'd rather watch this over Night of Champions.",1408060800,,1579,4.748175182481752
