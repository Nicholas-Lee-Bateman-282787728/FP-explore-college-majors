Claudia (Bethany Simons-Danville) receives the doll for her birthday, but from whom?  It is the ugliest doll she has ever seen. Her parents think so too. They put the doll in a trunk.  That's not going to stop this living doll, Chucky. It has a knife and goes upstairs. He stabs the nice British father, Richard (Simon James Morgan), then delightfully kills the naked mother, (Stephanie Chambers) in the shower. Then he goes to Claudia. He stabs, but it is only another doll. Claudia is behind him at the door. Chucky pees his pants.
  Glen the doll is part of a ventriloquist act. He wonders who his parents are. And so we are taken back to Chucky and Tiffany filming a movie with Jennifer Tilly.  Glen sees the interview on television and the same ""Made in Japan"" birthmark. He just found his parents. Now on to Hollywood.

Chucky has pretty much accepted that he's a doll for life now and takes on the twisted roll of fatherhood that has been bestowed upon him.

I recommend for fans of the series and for fans of twisted humor.",1373932800,,390,4.402777777777778

1502227,1,B00005JND2,"I am a big fan of chucky as he is one of my personal best horror icons.....but this movie really isn't good. the little jokes are not funny, its not scary, awful acting and line delivery, awful plot and the kid.....hes so annoying. He is like an emo doll thats always sad. don't get this movie. get childs play 2 instead.",1356566400,2,321,4.278688524590164
1502228,1,B00005JND2,"There isn't much I have to say regarding Seed of Chucky. Let's begin by saying I've seen this movie five or six times as, for a few years, it was the only Chucky movie I had in the collection.
Basically, what you have here is an entirely comedy-based film about Chucky and Tiffany having a baby together. This movie deals with more murdering than I remember from any of the previous Chucky movies, although the murdering still doesn't save this movie from being so terrible. We have Billy Boyd playing the Seed of Chucky, a doll with an undetermined gender, named Glen/Glenda. It is a disturbing movie in the way that the doll is, indeed, undetermined, and has no ""parts"" (they show a close-up of that) but yet has a ""guy"" voice.
For the longest time, the dolls argue about the doll's gender.
Then, to make the movie suck even more, Jennifer Tilly is back, alive and well again, as if she never died in Bride (which she did, for those of you keeping score).
This movie isn't anything like a Chucky movie should be. It's a disgrace to the series, and it is very hard to watch from start to finish. Because of this movie, the next one, Curse of Chcuky, is being released on DVD, because they spent so much money making this one theatrical, then it sucked, and they didn't make much money.
One day I would like to ask Brad Dourif if, for one second, he ever stopped and didn't want to do any of these latter Chucky movies. I know I wouldn't want to have been on the team for a Chucky movie. I dislike the idea of 1) giving Chucky a bride and 2) Continuing the series for more money!
Avoid ad ALL costs!  That is all :)",1344297600,,1615,4.3125
1502229,4,B00005JND2,"Surprisingly entertaining, but weird horror-comedy film.
The horror comedy genre is definitely an acquired taste.
This film has some definite horror in it, but also some entertainment value that sends up Chucky as a villain, but also with some human qualities.
Watch this with an open mind.",1339977600,,290,5.191489361702128
1502339,5,B00005JND2,"I like Seed of Chucky as much as The Bride of Chucky.  It has the same kind of camp effect as Bride of Chucky.  Jennifer Tilly is fantastic, she offers comedy relief and she doesn't take her character too seriously.  It's also bizarre to watch the spawn of Chucky, it's fun to watch ""it"" in action. There's some funny campy lines in Seed of Chucky.  ""U can always smell it on girls who sell it"". Haha.  Seed of Chucky has some cool special effects, an interesting story and some gory scenes like a good horror movie should have.",1310515200,,528,4.346938775510204
1502340,3,B00005JND2,"Ever since I was young, I have had a thing for Chucky. I remember being so excited to see this movie. I was very disappointed about this. Though I gave it 3 stars, I still like it, mainly because I love Chucky, and I could never turn my back on the series. The main reason(s) for dis-liking this film most out of the series is because (1)This is the first Chucky to include nudity within the movie, I think any horror movie can do without nudity, and seeing it in a chucky movie is just not right in my opinion. (2)I hate how Glen is made to appear Japanese, it throws the whole thing off, how could he be Japanese if his parents are both American? and (3)I don't like how Jennifer Tilly acts as both the doll and herself within casting, especially if she was in Bride of Chucky.

These are just my thoughts on the film. I love Chucky, but there is a limit. They need more HORROR and less comedy.",1278201600,,896,4.179190751445087
1502341,5,B00005JND2,Oh No Here Comes baby chucky. okay i'll have to admit that this is not the best in the childs play series but still good. and it's funny to. i love chucky. this movie is great for a time saver. I'm still glad to see that brad dourif is still the voice of chucky. I hope he keeps doing his voice if they make another film. the story to this one is kind of silly compare to the other movies. but hey chucky is awesome. and I will always like these movies. and I like the fact that they gave them dysfunctional family problems. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1269734400,,580,4.008620689655173

1502344,2,B00005JND2,I will never really understand why Hollywood will put together something that cost a lot of money even though it is a shot in the dark. This movie reminded me of Wes Craven's New Nightmare it was not scary at all and it had the actual actress Jeniffer Tilly star as herself in the movie which made it seem all the more ridicules and if that wasn't enough they cast rapper Redman in the movie as well!! I don't know why rappers think they can act on screen but in my opinion they should stick with being phooney gangsters over the sound waves it's best they stick with what luck they might have already. Anyway I saw in the special features that there might be a sixth Chucky later on down the road I hope it was just a dream because they cannot butcher this franchise anymore.,1241222400,,776,4.285714285714286
1502345,5,B00005JND2,"Seed of Chucky (or Child's Play 5) is a much better movie than most of these reviews suggest it is. Similar to Bride of Chucky, this is more Comedy than Horror but it is still a funny, gorey slasher movie.

The movie starts as Glen heads to hollywood with plans of bringing his parents (Chucky and Tiffany) back from the dead. However, they run into some family probelms along the way as Chucky insists that Glen is a boy while Tiffany says that Glenda is a girl. As well as argueing over the gender of their child, Chucky and Tiffany go on a bloody killing-spree to the horror of their offspring, Glen(da).

Seed of Chucky is a funny (and sometimes scary) movie with plenty of blood and gore. I was surprised to see that when they brought back the Child's Play series (first ""Bride of..."", now this) they turned it more or less into a comedy, but I like these just as much as the Child's Play movies.

I would reccomend this movie to fans of either horror or comedy movies and to anybody who enjoyed the previous Chucky movies, especially Bride of Chucky.",1237507200,,1056,4.43298969072165
1502346,3,B00005JND2,"The Bottom Line:

Seed of Chucky is really a bad horror film, especially the parts involving Chucky's child, but the self-aware parts with Jennifer Tilly are so fresh and funny that I can't hate or condemn the entire film; it's not really worth watching or buying, but it's not the bottom of the barrel either.",1232755200,,310,4.636363636363637
1502347,5,B00005JND2,I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time but didn't have the money to pay full price for the DVD in stores. So I came to Amazon.com to search for it. I found it for $0.89! That's the cheapest I ever paid for a DVD. I would consider buying more DVDs from the seller. And I just may do that soon.,1223596800,,306,3.723076923076923
1502348,5,B00005JND2,"I thought this was a really good sequel to the franchise! I love when Chucky and Tiffany kill some guy and blood is splashing everywhere, and they play romantic music. 5 years after Chucky and Tiffany died and Tiffany gave birth to a child, the child has grown a little older and wants to know what his parents are like. While working for a mean ventriloquist, their son sees them on t.v. because Hollywood is making a Chucky movie. Their son escapes and goes to Hollywood to look for them. He finds them and uses the voodoo amulet(the ""Heart of Damballa"" from the previous film) to bring them back to life. After they wake up, Chucky makes fun of his son, not knowing who he is, but soon finds out that it is his son. They name him Glen. Glen wants nothing to do with killing, so Tiffany wants to stop, cold turkey, but Chucky is reluctant. Tiffany finds out that Jennifer Tilly is playing her in the movie, but Jennifer wants a better part, so she sees Redman about playing the Virgin Mary in his Bible epic. He refuses at first, but Jennifer wants to have her way with him in order to get the part. Later at Jennifer's house, Chucky and Tiffany make a plan to transfer their souls into Redman and Jennifer, but they need a baby for Glen's soul, so they get Jennifer pregnant. During getting Jennifer's days of pregnancy, Chucky takes Glen on a 'Boys Night Out' and kill some people, such as Britney Spears! After Jennifer becomes pregnant, Chucky and Tiffany hold Jennifer hostage in her own home. After Tiffany helps deliver the baby, another baby comes out. During the chaos of the screaming babies, Tiffany yelling at Chucky to do the chant, Jennifer yelling for help, and Glen being confused about his gender, after 5 movies, Chucky decides to stay a doll. Tiffany doesn't so Chucky decides he wants to kill her. Later at the hospital, after Chucky kills Tiffany in doll-form, a final battle between father and son ensues. If you love comedy, horror, and Chucky, you'll love SEED OF CHUCKY!!!",1222387200,,1999,4.571030640668524

I was never a big chucky fan cause he was just stupid but i like the originals way more than this,not that i really like them but comparing them to these last two i go for the originals man.

1502457,3,B00005JND2,"Either you love it or you hate it, but the Child's Play series definitely delves into 100% camp with this entry. It was tongue-in-cheek with Bride, and with Seed, it's completely over the top. Is that bad? It's according to who you ask. For me, I completely loved it. It's rare when you're watching a mainstream film and asking yourself if what you just saw on-screen just happened.

 The plot of Seed of Chucky is obvious from its title. We are introduced to Glen(da), the offspring seen shooting out of Tiffany at the end of Bride. He was taken by a carnie to perform as the carnie's ventriliquist dummy. Glen(da) sees a report of a movie being made based on Chucky and Tiffany, and declares the duo his parents. What happens after is the rebirth of Chucky and Tiffany in a scene so true to Bride that it's superior to the entirety that was Bride. Jennifer Tilly spoofs herself as herself and as the person that Tiffany decides to possess.

 Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly revel in their characters in the film. It was entertaining to see Jennifer Tilly as herself complaining about her C-list status and the acts that she will perform to gain the right part. Redman has a part in this film, and while the need for his character (also as himself) is funny, his performance was about the only low thing I found with the film. An amazing cameo and demise by John Waters is here. The doll effects keep on improving with each film. I still love the aerial shots with actual people playing the dolls. It sort of gives an eerie few seconds into a 90 minute film of spoof and insanity.

 No, the Child's Play films aren't at all in the tone that the first three were, and it's a step up in the camp factor from Bride, but where else would you see all the insane stuff you see in this film? It's been four years since it was released, and no news (aside from a possible remake of Child's Play) on another entry involving the Ray family has surfaced.",1197504000,,1943,4.41340782122905
1502458,3,B00005JND2,"The Chucky films have had a curious consistency in the decline of horror and the incline of humour. Child's Play was played straight for chills. Yes, it was ridiculous but had a rather mean-spirited edge to it that made you forget how silly it was. Child's Play 2 was less savage but with a touch more humour. Child's Play 3 (a film that had an unbelievably bad reputation thanks to moronic tabloids in the UK) found the right balance between laughs and scares. Chucky was downright evil, but you began to root for him more and more because his one-liners and easily irritable personality became rather er...cute. Ronny Yu's Bride Of Chucky, while very gory, simply was not a horror film at all - an entertaining black comedy that was ridiculously over-the-top, yes, but not a horror.

Now, fifth time around, series creator Don Mancini steps behind the camera, cranks the bad taste all the way up to eleven and delivers the most intelligent dumb film you've ever seen. The horror is non-existent but the gore is plentiful and the humour sicker than a syphilitic junkie. He rips out all the stop signs with such carefree abandon and directs with such hedonistic pleasure that you can't help pity other directors who take their own material far too seriously.

The child born at the end of Bride Of Chucky (voiced by Billy Boyd) has been picked up by a gruff English new age traveller and made to act in a fake-ventriloquist circus show, thanks to his bizarre doll-like appearance. He knows he's not normal, suffers terrible nightmares of killing and slaughter and is eager to find his real parents.

In Hollywood, a new movie called Chucky Goes Psycho, starring Jennifer Tilly, based on the Chucky urban legend is in production and when the young orphan sees a behind-the-scenes clip of what can only be his real mum and dad on TV, he escapes to Tinseltown to find out why they abandoned him. The obligatory chant to the almighty voodoo god Damballa resurrects Chucky and Tiffany, who are more than delighted to be together with their own child. Trouble is, they can't decide whether he's a boy, or a girl - a Glen, or a Glenda.

However, the killer dolls are still keen to get out of their plastic bodies once and for all and be human again. Obviously Tiffany is partial to Jennifer Tilly's body and Chucky aims to switch places with rapper/actor/director Redman who is planning a new Jesus Christ movie. As you can imagine, many deaths occur along the way, much to the distress of Glen/Glenda.

It sounds same-old-same-old, but let me assure you that Mancini crams as much daft humour and sick jokes in as possible. John Waters - the King of Bad Taste himself - has a hilarious extended cameo as a sleazy tabloid photographer who happens to snap a silhouetted image of Chucky hammering one off to a porno mag. How crazy is that? Chucky himself is a wonderful comic character. You just can't help but love him. Don't you think that he and Tiffany make a cute couple? He may be short but he's far scarier than Michael Myers ever was and his mere presence makes every scene a riot.

Seed Of Chucky is not a film for everyone. You have to be pretty open-minded to endure the morbid humour, but it's the guiltiest pleasure you're likely to have for a long time. The self-aware Hollywood references never become intrusive and the convoluted story never becomes confusing. Still, as I have said, it's not easy going entertainment if you're a stuffy conservative.

All fans of gore and brainless amusement must see. Oh, and in case you recognise the actor playing Jennifer Tilly's lawyer, that's Nicholas Rowe, better known as Young Sherlock Holmes.

The HD DVD is pretty average I'm afraid. Scenes shot on location sparkle with brightness and are very crisp but scenes shot on a soundstage look very soft and two-dimensional. A Dolby TrueHD track is also included with a big bunch of extras.",1196812800,2,3886,4.704411764705882

What a brilliant choice of name for Chucky's kid with gender issues since it's name (Glen or Glenda) is a tribute to the Ed Wood film of the same name about a transgender man.

Now I want you people to know something. The Chucky series has always been kinda cheesy. Most movies of this genre is. Just look at the basic plot of the first movie: A killer puts his soul into a doll to survive and then tries to return to human form by trying to enter the body of a little boy. Yeah, that's quite realistic to me!!! I wasn't expecting a masterpiece here, but I was expecting at least a semi-entertaining film that would give me a few reasons to watch it agagin. But, that will not happen unless I get drunk or take one too many hits of acid..the movie would still suck!!! The reason I hate this movie so much is that its just so over-the-top stupid, NOT FUNNY!!

I guess people thought a killer doll on the loose offered more funnies than scaries.  Not me.  Actually, the times have changed and now it's harder to create horror movies.  I think that's why Chucky movies went in the direction they did.

I want to send a thank you to the person who noticed that the doll in this movie looked like David Bowie from the Ziggy Stardust days.  Yes, that's EXACTLY right!  I kept looking at that doll and wondering where I'd seen that face before.  Now I know!

Yes, the storyline is now more exciting than ever.  Chucky now has a FAMILY, which means a wife and a child.  That certainly was a strange storyline twist!  I like it, though.  It offers creativity and prevents Chucky movies from all looking the same.

Jennifer Tilly plays an unusual part in this movie.  I like her as an actress but can't believe she'd play in THIS kind of movie.

1502584,1,B00005JND2,"Let's just get down to the nitty-and-gritty reasons of why I don't like this movie.

We all know that Chucky introduced the fear of talking dolls and that the character has spanned about 5 movies but all the charm and wit and scares have been drained out of the franchise, leaving it blank with uncreative choices and terribel hollywoodized material.

First off, the movie had like 7 so-called ""homages"" or ""rip offs"" of the movie PSYCHO. Let me be clear on this, if you put enough scenes from another movie into your movie then it's no longer your movie, bud. The whole Shower scene has been milked to death and, frankly, I'm getting tired of that old gimmick.

Secondly, the offspring of the killer dolls is underplayed and undervoiced.

The special effects are cheesy and non-believable.

There's no definitive tie to BRIDE OF CHUCKY.

And, what makes this movie the worst of the series is the fact that the celebrities were spoofing themselves. If audiences really wanted to see that, then this should have been a short film and not a major hollywood production.

I seriously used to get nightmares just thinking about Chucky but now all of that was slapped out of me by wasting an hour and a half watching this movie.

Plus, lets not forget the ending. The ending is totally a kick in the face to many of the fans of the chucky series. I hear that a sixth one is in production but it will probably be just as lifeless and just as scrappy as this one. They should have gotten Ronny Yu to direct this film.

what really kills me is that this makes the franchise unreliable becuase it followed in the footsteps of Halloween: ressurection, which was a total waste. They should have ended the series with bride of chucky.

In this movie Chucky and Tiffany's son is born. But he does not want to be an evil murderer like his parents. So he tries to convert them. Tiffany agrees and quits. Chucky said he agreed but had his two fingers crosses. Then Tiffany had lots of slips and hid them from everybody.

1502681,4,B00005JND2,"I'm totally in love with the Chucky films now, not so much the earlier ones, but the later ones are soooo funny! I've already had to buy my own copy of Bride Of Chucky, and now I want my own copy of this! It's so good! The thing about Bride & Seed of Chucky, is that they are stand alone films - you only need to have a basic knowledge of the previous 3 films.

It carries on from Bride Of Chucky, with the 'seed of Chucky' fertilising an egg, and a child coming to life. Then it all goes haywire, and I had difficulty trying to figure out what on earth was going on! :) Thankfully, I didn't open my mouth & ask, cos I eventually figured it out. There's actually a film being made about Chucky & Tiffany, with new dolls (as you remember they were basically destroyed at the end of Bride), and Jennifer Tilly is in the film, but actually playing Jennifer Tilly. It all gets very confusing, cos I thought they'd actually managed to bring back Jennifer Tilly playing Tiffany, but they hadn't.

The child doll that was born, I've read many reviews saying that it looks like an early David Bowie - no it doesn't!!! Can no one see the resemblence between Glen(da), and the characters in Corpse Bride? The hollowed cheekbones (grrrr), and dark shadowed eyes?

And how refreshing is it to see an actress like Jennifer Tilly not starving herself to death and being proud enough to flaunt her curves? She's a gorgeous gal (she's 47!), and although you're quite often distracted by her cleavage, she's a welcome change to many other Hollywood stars with no cleavage, and all bony. She was apparently trying to lose weight for this film, but just in case she didn't, she got a few 'fat' jokes written in. She also mocks her voice and her behaviour. (And she has dark hair in this too!)

There are a lot of in jokes & celebrity references in this, most of which I probably missed, but there are a couple I got. There are some references to one of Jennifer's other films, Bound, which I haven't seen, and she talks about her 'special' relationship with her other costar. There's a very, very good lookalike of Britney Spears in this, who Chucky drives off the road, and then says ""Ooops, I did it again!"" Jennifer talks frequently about Julia Roberts stealing all the good roles, and about how she could have done a better job of Erin Brockovich, and not needed a wonderbra. She also mentions Anna Nicole Smith. John Waters appears, as a paparazzi, and dies a very unusual death. Other references include Psycho, Shining (""I can't think of a thing to say""), Rosemary's Baby, and I spotted a hint of Pinocchio? There's references to Martha Stewart as well, but there was a brief reference to her in the previous film. There are plenty of other references, you'll have great fun spotting them.

Hannah Spearritt also appears, in one of her major film roles, since S Club 7 split up (who I loved by the way, and I still have all their albums!), and although she does end up getting killed off, she is a breath of fresh air, as a star who is also not afraid of her body.

I'm still after my Tiffany doll, but so far, no such luck. Tiffany & Chucky make such a cute couple in this, they're so sweet together.

Who else thinks there will be at least one more Chucky? If I can do my maths correct (ha!), there's a 20th anniversary coming up soon, so maybe a new film especially for that. I hope so, cos I'm officially loving these films now. I'm sure there's a couple of references I've missed too.",1142467200,6,3477,4.414976599063962

It seemed like he was just trying too hard to be funny and he kinda strayed from his evil side and became a comedian. I don't know if he was bored or felt he wasn't paid enough for this role but i suspect his acting career is over. Geez, maybe they should have just made a plastic doll, it would have been a lot cheaper than having to pay for this short greedy red head!",1139270400,,520,4.158415841584159
1502687,3,B00005JND2,"Continuing from Bride of Chucky... Tiffany has given birth to a strange looking razor tooth baby named Sh*thead. The seed is kidnapped by a british ventriloquist and forced to compete in ventriloquism contests in England. Sh*thead looks like a dead ringer for David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust days. He has a kind soul and is nothing like his parents.

 As each day passes hes wondering where his parents are and dreaming of meeting them. Soon enough he manages to escape and ends up in America. He makes it to the set of the movie where Tiffany and Chucky are filming a movie. He reads the voodoo chant words on his necklace and manages to bring his parents back to life.

Chucky and Tiffany cant tell what their child is so they take off his pants to reveal a barbie-like crotch. Tiffany wants a girl so she names her Glenda and Chucky wants a boy so he names him Glen. If you ask me id say its more like a boy. But Tiffany and Chucky continue to argue over it throughout the movie. To the suprise of Glen/Glenda his parents are killers , they try to do whats best for Glen/Glenda but its hard to stop killing, especially for Chucky. Papa Chucky wants to turn his son into a killer but Tiffany wants to stop the killing for her son/daughters best interest.

Overall, its a strange funny film more than scary. The movies in the series just get more weird by the years. I wonder what they'll think of next.",1138838400,24,1406,4.3961538461538465
1502688,3,B00005JND2,"The Seed of Chucky was interesting and what was even more interesting is the child that he and tiffany conceived. In the previews the kid is inside of his mothers belly and he looks exactly what you would think chucky's child would look like, like a crazy psycho killer. I won't spoil it but when you see the kid as he is older and looking for his parent's you are disappointed by the way he acts but then you start giggling and then cracking up. You not only laugh at the way he acts but the way he talks and looks just takes the comedy to another level. The movie is violent but that's all and even when chucky is sneaking up on his victims your never scared. You just can't wait for the next scene with chucky and tiff arguing and brutally murdering each other with their killer jokes. Seed of chucky is a really good movie but like most of the recent releases it's not a good scary movie. I give it 3 stars because your lead into thinking the movie is scary from the previews but once you start watching it you quickly find it's true calling to be a comedy.",1137456000,,1061,4.205882352941177
1502689,3,B00005JND2,"Chucky is funny?  It's true.  Chucky and Tiffany are hilarious, and their sex-confused son/daughter Glen/Glenda is even more hilarious.  When Chucky and Tiffany find out that they have a child (Glen/Glenda), they decide to bury the hatchet (literally!) and stop killing for the sake of their offspring.  This, however, is quite difficult, especially for Tiffany, so she calls the help line to get help.

This is not your typical Chucky movie, far from it actually.  The scene where Tiffany is gutting Redman from under the table looks totally fake and disgusting at the same time.  Such scenes like when Chucky comes after Jennifer Tilly on the bed, then Tiffany walks in the room and says ""What's going on here?"" , and then Chucky says ""Sh-she came onto me!"" makes this movie unbelievably funny.

This is a must-see for any Chucky fan, and/or if you saw the first 4 movies...even if u don't watch from the first one, it's ok cuz this movie stands alone.

I hope there isn't gonna be a 6th movie.  If there is, may God have mercy on us all!! :S",1137369600,,1044,4.625
1502690,5,B00005JND2,"SPOILER WARNING!

I, as a filmmaker, was not expecting much from the latest sequel to Child's Play. Usually whenever a horror movie moves into space, or involves a rap artist, that's usually the all-time low. Well, I began to watch.

First thing off the bat is the first person perspective dream sequence that alluded to Hitchcock's Psycho, and Halloween. I enjoyed this, especially when the father falls down the stairs, which was a great use of this technique.

But right before things got too serious, it's revealed at the very beginning that this movie is going to be taking jabs at itself, it's actors, and everybody involved.

I hate rap music, and I hate rap artists trying to be actors, and beating up our horror icons (see Halloween: Resurrection). Redman's performance was brilliant, as he played himself trying to score, and make it big with his acting career, which he is taunting by mentioning it. Also, he's trying to score with Tilly, a commendable goal. His delivery of the line: ""I had a vasectomy as soon as I got into the biz,"" was inspired, as he paid no heed to Tilly's sadness and continued eating spagetti.

Glen's gender confusion was also incredibly well thought out. Glen kinda looks familiar, doesn't he? If you said David Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust era (which is when he took his androgynous to the extreme), then you read my mind. Especially funny, is that he even has the British accent.

The funniest part of the movie, though, goes to Chucky as he chops through a door and fails to deliver a famous quote that I was almost certain he'd say. Left me laughing for days.

Looks like the ending of the movie returns our anti-hero back to his solo career, answering many prayers of fans of the original Chucky. Right when I was starting to get used to the idea of a comedic Chucky.

What I loved most about this movie is that Chucky's family reminds me of my family. Slightly twisted, but there's heart. It's a heart-warming family values movie with blood, and guts.",1135209600,,1998,4.672364672364672

Seed of Chucky comes from Universal in a very sharp looking 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer,and the print sports deep colors and well-defined black levels. There are some small grain issues in spots,but overall this one looks quite good throughout.

  SOUND:

There are two strong audio choices,available in eighter Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS and either one is solid. Dialogue is crisp,with directional movement creating a full fell across the front with a nice use of the surround channels to fill out the soundstage,as the sub delivers some boomy atmosphere when needed. The Transfer really does just to the score from the great Pino Donaggio,as well.

Nothing scary, but gore galore.  When this movie tries to be funny, it really hits the spot.  I love the showdown between Chucky and Glen/Glenda.  YOU PROUD OF ME NOW DAD!!!!!  This one is a real piece of work.  It goes right up there with Shaun of the Dead on the horror/comedy scale.  The opening is great, but the ending didn't do much for me.

1502815,4,B00005JND2,"Seed of Chucky, the fifth entry in the Child's Play series is probably the most amusing sequel to Child's Play. The Seed of Chucky is more a dark comedy than a serious horror film. Chucky and Tiffany's ""seed"" looks like David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust era, and is also gender confused Glen/Glenda. Glen/Glenda does not want to follow in his/her parents footsteps and murder people. While Chucky and Tiffany still want to find human bodies to transfer their souls into. I had grown tired of the Child's Play series, but I actually found Seed of Chucky to be quite entertaining when compared to Child's Play 2 or 3.",1128729600,2,617,4.669724770642202
1502816,3,B00005JND2,"First, perhaps you should think 'Seed Of Chucky' as comedy with gore.  Second, though the title suggests otherwise, the stars of the new entry in 'Chucky' series are not Chucky or his child.  You see the killing doll again, but the real star here is scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly, who plays herself and provides the voice to Chucky's bride Tiffany.

[PLAYING THEMSELVES] The story is weak, but it begins pretty well.  We find a new Chucky film is being shot, starring self-parodying Jennifer Tilly, who, dissatisfied with the roles coming to her, decides to court rapper Redman (as himself) who is to direct a film about Virgin Mary.

In the meanwhile, the evil dolls Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (voice by Jennifer Tilly) are brought back to life, and start to kill right in front of their child (voiced by Billy Boyd), who came over to LA from England only to find the nature of his (or her?) parents.  (By the way, the first victim is make-up artist Tony Gardner playing Tony Gardner himself -- self-referential gag again).

[YOU EITHER GET IT OR NOT] Now, you see.  You either love the jokey tone of 'Seed of Chucky' or hate it.  The story gets muddled in the confusing second half, in which Jennifer Tilly confronts the dolls who want her body.  The in-jokes are mostly silly, and works sporadically, but often falls flat simply because they are too obvious.

Even so, I cannot help being amused by the over-the-top turns from Jennifer Tilly, whose self-parodying acting is as outrageous and demented as those of Bette Davies and Joan Crawford in 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane.'  You may be greatly entertained, or simply disgusted, by her.  I happen to find myself strongly attracted to her.  I always like it when a beauty like Jennifer Tilly does silly things on screen.  But i also know this time she went too far when some of her words and actions are alarmingly real (including a 'fat joke').

All in all, 'Seed of Chucky' is an OK film, most of which audiences know what they will see beforehand.  Its self-conscious tone is appropriate, and the two dolls are (kind of) delightful to see, thanks to the good perfromance from Dourif and Tilly again.  Unfortunately, the 'Seed' of the film is a rather dull character, and despite the funny cameo from cult director John Waters, the gags and in-jokes, mostly crude and gross-out, are not as clever as those of 'Bride of Chucky.'  In short, this is strictly for the fans.",1127520000,,2446,4.699530516431925
1502817,1,B00005JND2,"I love horror movies. I love B-rate movies. I really love bad movies. I thought there was no limit to what I could watch. I was wrong.

This is without a doubt the stupidest, most ill-conceived excuse for a movie anyone anywhere has ever come up with. I stayed faithful to Chucky through all his movies, but this was embarrassingly bad. Even Jennifer Tilly who was sexy in the 'Bride of Chucky' is now a fat joke and cliche of herself.

You really got to put your mind in neutral for this. First you have to see that this movie is about the making of the next Chucky movie. Then you have to let it go that the two monster dolls can actually conceive offspring. Then finally you just accept that the 'seed of Chucky' is ugly enough to make Chucky himself look cute. To top it off, he also has gender issues. You couldn't pay me to watch this again.",1127347200,5,847,4.254658385093168

They took a horror series and MTVed it up to a lousy comedy.  The only thing funny about this peice of shart, is nothing.....Bride of Chucky was kinda lousy, but this one made me ashamed to be called a man. It is so utterly cheesy (and not in a good way like the old ones), and the jokes are not funny.  The celebrity cameos tried to conceal what a box office bunghole this movie is....

Along for the ride are Jenniffer Tilly (who does an excellent job poking fun at herself), rapper Redman, and director John Waters. There's tons of over-the-top violence and humor but very little of anything else. Anyone expecting a horror film from ""Seed"" will be strongly dissapointed as its sole intention seems to be laughs, this go-around. Even ""Bride Of Chucky"" which had far more humor than the first three looks like a serious horror film in comparison.",1126396800,,665,4.893805309734513
1502889,4,B00005JND2,"ok, i recently just bought child's play, and the chucky collection (child's play 2, 3, and bride of chucky). And im about to buy seed of chucky, even though ive seen it about 10 times. So this is what i think about not only seed of chucky, but chucky himself.

Ok so in 1988 a movie came out called, ""Child's Play"" all about a a serial killer named Chareles Lee Ray who tranfers his soul into a child's doll, *a good guy doll to be exact*. And some spoiled brat named andy gets him for his B day. Later in the movie, chucky (Ray) finds out that he has 2 transer his soul into the first person he told about himself being charles lee ray (which is andy) to get out of the body. This movie was a great horror flick that was full of suspense.

1990 and 1991, child's play 2 and 3. Great sequels. The 2nd one was about chucky coming back to life thanks to the doll manager dude person prick. Chucky finds Andy living with a new family (and just getting out of the orphanage). Andy finds out chuckys back, flips out, no1 will believe until they all die, and blah blah blah if youve seen it you know if you haven't see it. once agian, great horror flick. Child's Play 3, Andy is 16 now, at military camp cuz no1 wants him i guess, and yet agian, chucky comes back to life because of the same doll manager prick dude (kills him this time though, yesss) and finds andy. BUT WAIT! THERE'S A TWIST! chucky realizes he has a new body, and meets a different kid. So chucky tries to get in that kids body instead of andys. Andy though wants to be a hero, and tries to warn tyler (the kid) about chucky, tyler refuses to listen, until he finds out the hard way...but andy saves the day and chucky is slashed into pieces by a fan. The End of the Child's Play series, and now It is, ""the life of chucky after andy series"".

1998, when we all thought the child's play drama was over..well..we were right, but not chucky! Chucky comes back for a forth chucky movie called Bride of Chucky...this is where the child's play series dies out...

BRIDE OF CHUCKY! good movie, but not a child's play movie. Lets go through the movie. Chucky's old girlfriend (played by the lovely Jennifer Tilly) brings him back to life. They get into a little fight about marrage...(can you see where this is going yet?) and so chucky gets pissed and kills her. Figures. But wait! Chucky decides to put her body in a doll and it works then they hitch a hide with sum unsespecting teens and the murders begin and ends with chucky killing Tiff and chucky getting shot! OK...I have many problems with this movie...first..where the hell is andy at? second..When chucky was dead did satan give him stand up comedy help or sumthin, y is he tryn to be more funny then scary? 3rd..this movie isn't scary, just bloody in some parts, and (god i hate to say this) more of a comedy, hence the name...horror comedy, the stupidest genre ever in my opinion. Now don't get me wrong i like this movie! but i don't like what they did to the chuck series..and now..

SEED OF CHUCKY, what this is all about. you've read about each movie, so now compare them to this, and lets see how seed fits in. Ok first we really don't know how chucky and tiff come back, but apparently someone found them, used the power of God to make them ptich perfect looking agian, and to do what?! make a movie about the killings..So if you remember right, chucky got lucky in bride of chucky and made the excuse (im all rubber!)..well look what happened now, chuckys son glen is in england being used as a puppet for this cheap puppettier dude. Glen sees Chucky and Tiff and tv, and realizes that they are his parents. Glen find his way to Chucky and Tiff where he brings them to life agian. BUT WAIT! WE HAVE A PROBLEM! Glen is a angel who doesnt wanna kill, he liturally won't even hurt i fly. So chucky tries to teach him to be a killer, while Tiff respects his thoughts and she tries to give up on killing, *by the way glen is sexually messed up, chucky says its a he, Tiff says its a she, so they argue about that in many parts of the movie) So chucky, tiff, and glen try and get there bodies into Jennifer Tilly and Redman (who play themselfs). and chucky masturbates to get sperm to put into Jennifer...wow..ya anyways so this is what i think of it..WHERE THE FREAK IS ANDY?!?!?! they need andy back. 2nd..this IS a comendy, no horror, just a comendy, even though it is by far the gooriest yet, not scary, just a comedy. 3rd, why is chucky trying to have a family? YOUR SUPPOSE TO BE A SERIAL KILLING BLOOD SPILLING DEMONIC SCARY DOLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! once agian, i like this movie, great movie, but THIS IS NOT CHUCKY.

So now that you've read all this, here is my view on the chucky movies, good movies, fun, good, scary(execpt for bride and seed), bloody movies. Here is my view on Chucky and the makers, producers, director, writters and everyone who works makin the movie. SELL OUT. complete sell out, good movies but you can deffenitly see where they are selling out at. To me, chucky is the metallica of movies, once had awesome, crazy, perfect heavy metal, now just nu metal, yet they are good, they wanted money, so they sold out. Chucky, once scary, awesome, even yes, had a lil sense of humor but did it right, not to much. Now, just a comedy. You see what happened? If you did or didn't all ready know, the 6th chucky movie is being made as we speech. I hope is it going to go back to their horror roots even though it probly wont. But hear me out. I am a chuck fan, I will buy every chucky movie that comes out just cuz i love chucky, seed of chucky is a good movie, but at the same time, it is a sell out from their old horror stuff.",1125100800,,5668,4.2777260018639325

1502893,4,B00005JND2,I have recently viewed the movie Seed of Chucky and I have to say this is different from the other 4. First of all some of the characters like Jennifer or Redman play themselves. I don't know about you but it is kind of weird knowing that they are playing themselves and not a made-up character like in the other child's play films. However there are some nice scenes in this movie including Chucky killing Britney Spears and Tiffany cutting out Redmans intestines. I do think that I liked Child's Play a little more in the first three films before Chucky got any sort of family. But if you like the origional four films or are a slasher movie fan (like me) I would reccomend you watch this film at least once.,1121385600,,710,4.386363636363637

Tillys humor is fairly good and some of her jabs at her Hollywood co-stars are zingers.

Don't expect too much--and this movies fine--possibly the second best in the series-after the original!

1502895,2,B00005JND2,"This movie could have gotten another star or two from me but I simply hate the self-referencial nature of it.

It's not as aggregious as the horrendous Ocean's Twelve where the character played by Julia Roberts tricks people into thinking she is Julia Roberts ""because she looks a lot like her"", but it does have the dolls that are being used to make a Chucky movie become the real Chucky and Tiffany.

There are plenty of people who are playing themselves in the movie.  The main one being Jennifer Tilly.  The Tiffany doll (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) of course has plenty of self-referencial situations with the real Jennifer Tilly.  Oh what fun!

The positives are that this movie does go pretty far with its shock value content but it is not really enough to redeem itself from the stupid self-referencial story they made.

The dvd says they already have plans for the next Chucky movie.  Hopefully, but not likely, they will drop the self-referencing, and come up with a better idea to base the story on than domestic squabbling around a sexual identity confused child (Glen/Glenda.

Billy Boyd did a terrific job doing the voice of that character.  And Jennifer Tilly really stepped up to the plate in this one poking fun at herself to the point it actually touches upon comic genius.  The dynamic between the family Tiffany, Chucky, Glen...Or is it Glenda? will hold your attention throughout.  And the casting of John Waters in the film was a particularly inspired choice.

Once again, Don Mancini penned the script and directed this time, but whereas BRIDE seemed fresh and innovative, SEED is merely an attempt to gross us out, and we miss the truly inspired fun we had with the BRIDE.  Chucky and Tiffany are resurrected by their son, Glen, who is working as a ventriloquist's dummy.  Reunited with his parents, Glen doesn't want them to be killers; in homage to Ed Wood's ""Glen or Glenda"", the new doll also has an identity crisis.  We even get the grossout director John Waters as a paparazzi photographer.  Jennifer Tilly is to be commended for her willingness to parody herself, the best line being when she says ""I've been nominated for an Oscar, how comes I get stuck in this kind of s..t?"".  How true, Jennifer.  Rapper Redman appears as a rap star who is going to make a movie about the Virgin Mary and Tilly wants the part.  She says she lost Erin Brockovich to Julia Roberts because Roberts slept with the director, so she decides to try the same with Redman.  This unholy alliance sets the stage for the birth of twins from the seed of Chucky.  The blood and gore are plentiful, and there's even a masturbation scene you won't believe.  I've enjoyed the Chucky series, but this latest entry doesn't take us anywhere we haven't already been and it's hyped up ending only serves to make our jaw drop in disbelief, as it seems another sequel may be in the works.

Soap Opera storylines, too many jokes centered around bodily functions, etc...

By the way.... is there a reason the ""child"" doll looks like David Bowie ?

I suppose with the homage to Glen or Glenda, Psycho, Shining, etc... is was only appropriate to use the best known british accented androgenous character as a model.

Not worthy of the CHUCKY name..... if the writing has dropped to this level, it' time for the Chucky series to end.",1119484800,11,683,4.65

1502995,3,B00005JND2,"As a huge fan of Chucky and the ""Child's Play"" franchise, my expectations were considerably huge for this sequel, which brings back Chucky and Tiffany from ""Bride of Chucky"" and adds a gender confused son to the mix. I'm sure this all sounded good on paper, with in-jokes, Chucky's maniacal demeanor, and Hollywood setting, but the end result doesn't quite measure up. For starters, this is more of a comedy than a horror film...granted, its understood the magic of the original ""Child's Play"" (which still plays like a wonderful creepfest) could not be recaptured, and the slant would be towards comedy after BOC, but at least that film still featured some creepy moments amid the comedy. ""Seed"" would have benefitted from some decent stalking scenes or suspense set-pieces (the opening scene comes very close, but thats it). Jennifer Tilly is a wonderful comedienne, but here she seems more fatigued than game. Casting Redman is yet another disastrous trend Hollywood is insistent on; casting rap stars with no acting ability to draw in the hip-hop crowd, and therefore coming across as blindingly amateurish (see the crowning achievement in bad acting, Busta Rhymes in ""Halloween Resurrection""). On the plus side, Chucky remains a wonderfully entertaining villian; I'd pay to watch him recite the phone book. John Waters (a self proclaimed huge Chucky fan) shows up to add some pizzazz. And the DVD is everything a Chucky fan could wish for: terrific audio commentaries from director Don Mancini and Tilly; behind the scenes featurettes; Chucky and Tiffany interviews; and specially made features just for the disc (make sure to get the unrated version of this). Obviously, any fan of the series needs to see this film, but ironically serious fans are the most likely to see the shortcomings of this installment...let's hope Chucky 6 brings back the right mix of laughs and chills.",1118793600,3,1884,5.080645161290323

1503091,5,B00005JND2,"...But that doesn't stop this from being a entertaining film. The worst part about it is the inclusion of Redman(there is an unfortunate need to put a popular rapper in horror films). After the bore-fest that was Child's Play III, Bride of Chucky blew me away. The story, the music, the comedy...I was digging it. I mean this movie gets bashed for being too outlandish and satyrical when the Chucky movies have always been that way since the first film! I mean come on, you have a killer doll screaming and cussing and killing. So this evolution was necessary to do something fun and new. I'm a gorehound and this movie had plenty of blood and guts. It had a really wacky plot(A gender confused son and artificially insemenating Jennifer Tilly w/ a turkey baster!?) Plus they got John Waters to become a victim in this! Awesome! This is a perfect companion to Bride of Chucky, although the soundtrack is nowhere near as good as Bride's. If you like horror movies with a lil' comedy, then this one will tickle your funny bone and then rip it out!",1118361600,,1045,4.5638297872340425
1503092,3,B00005JND2,"In the fifth installment of Chucky--the serial killing doll--the story continues with Chucky, but he is not the main attraction anymore.  Instead, the film opens with an interesting computer generated image that depicts the fertilization of an egg in the fallopian tubes, which continues to divide itself in a rapid manner until it has created a fetus.  This fetus has a mark on its wrist that says, ""Made in Japan"", a possible hint towards the Omen (1976) where Satan's son has the mark of three sixes.  The fetus later appears to be Chucky's offspring whom seems to take over the leading part in this episode.

After the introduction, the ripping of a box brings the audience to a family who receives the doll of Chucky's child. This scene opens with a camera shot in first person perspective much like Humphrey Bogart's character in Dark Passage (1947) where they shoot the film in first person perspective prior the plastic surgery or some of Brian De Palma's films.  There is also a scene in this opening sequence, which brings to mind Hitchcock's brilliant shower scene from Psycho (1960).

If the audience expects a typical Chucky slasher film, they will be disappointed, as this story focuses on the child of Chucky desiring to find a home and family.  In some aspects, the film has some resemblance with the Disney film Pinocchio (1940), yet this is far darker and disturbing tale.  Eventually, as expected, the youngster doll discovers his parents through a television show that is promoting an upcoming film about Chucky.  However, it is not the real Chucky, as this doll is a mere puppet. Nonetheless, the child of Chucky sets out to find his parents.

The reunion between Chucky (Brad Dourif), Chucky's wife Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), and their child (Billy Boyd) brings them to the set where Jennifer Tilly, herself, is performing a part in a coming Chucky film.  However, it is nothing like Chucky's child had expected, as he is next to being a pacifist.  Despite his parent's murderous tendencies, he decides to accept them for who they are, which brings the audience through an amusing self-help venture where they try to use the 12 steps program to prevent themselves from continuing their homicidal habits.

The director and writer Don Mancini created Chucky while a film student at UCLA and this time he turns it into a dark caricature of Chucky, horror films, and other contemporary social issues.  Seed of Chucky has some similarities with the recent Team America: World Police with its heavy parody while trying to be both funny and scary by using scenes from films such as Psycho (1960) and the Shining (1980).  The film has some highlights and funny one-liners, yet it does not deliver a full-fledged feature.  Seed of Chucky seems to need more work in order to provide a better cinematic experience.  Unfortunately, the film leaves most viewers with an experience where the weakness rests within the intended humor that does not rise to the occasion while the suspense seems to be faltering.  Nonetheless, the film will with no doubt give room for some laughter and goriness, as Chucky makes his fourth comeback.",1118361600,,3137,4.909090909090909
1503093,3,B00005JND2,"Let's face it, Chucky movies have always ran on a thin line between horror and absurdity, but it was in 1998's ""Bride of Chucky"" where director Ronny Yu and writer Don Mancini really embraced this cohesion, blending sinister off-color humor with gore and carnage, and quite entertainingly I might add. With ""Seed of Chucky"" first time director but long time Chucky scripter Don Mancini takes it a level further. While ""Bride of Chucky"" was quite amusing in it's depravity, ""Seed of Chucky"" is completely dripping in the excess of that idea. I'm of course talking about masturbating/peeing puppets, family values among psychotic killer dolls, a child that doesn't know if it's a boy or a girl, Jennifer Tilley playing a promiscuous version of herself who will sleep with anybody in an attempt to save her career, an artificially inseminated voodoo pregnancy, the 12 step program, and more blood than any other Chucky movie out there. If any of this sounds like its over the top that's because it is. Way over.
Although this movie was still a lot of fun, I'm not about to give a gold star because of its outrageousness. Although I've enjoyed the last two films I really feel it's time to give this series a rest. Don Mancini has done a good job at breathing new life into the Chucky series with his idea for ""Bride of Chucky"" and it taking it further with ""Seed"" , but I feel that if the story line gets anymore ridiculous or over the top than it already is, it will just be entering the realm of stupidity. Mancini should just let it go after this one. Too much of a good thing can make it not so good anymore. And everyone knows that after the fifth film in any horror movie franchise, the same ideas get rehashed over and over and it just stops being fun anymore. In some cases it can start with the third or fourth film in the series.
I don't want to sound like I'm doggin on this movie because I'm really not. This has all the fun and blood you loved in ""Bride of Chucky"" times two and I absolutely recommend any Chucky fan to buy this one, because your Chucky collection won't be complete with out it. I'm just worried that if the series goes into anything beyond this, it will start wearing down the series. Chucky is 5 for 5 in my book, why make it  5 for 8 or even 5 for 10?

Don't get me wrong I am a big Child's Play fan, but they keep on taking these characters in the wrong direction!  I hope that they go back to the storyline of the first three child's play films when they develop the 6th installment of this series.  Please rent this film FIRST before buying!

1503095,4,B00005JND2,"Get ready for some more fun, for Chucky is back with a vengeance. In this latest installment, the infamous killer doll and his psycho-bride welcome their long lost mixed-up gender child Glen or Glenda (the Edward D. Wood Jr. movie of the same name and topic) and show him/her how to party.  With Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly tagging along once again as the voices of you-know-who all is well in the world. What's even more wicked is that the script calls for Tilly to play herself. indeed, in SEED, she is also Jennifer Tilly, the actress without a career who stays afloat by slumming expressively her way through another Chucky movie--until she comes face to face with the psychotic dolls who kidnap her and force on her an impregnation one has to see to believe.  As if it weren't enough, there's Glen or Glenda who passively witnesses those events as he/she slowly but surely approaches cuckoo ville.  Creator and first-time director Don Mancini obviously goes for the guffaws and delivers a fun and unique little piece of filmmaking that mixes several classics moments (Halloween, Psycho, even Child's Play, amongst others) to his slick visual style. His direction is sharp and raw, as are the exploits of his trio plastic dysfunctional family members. While jaw-dropping some of their actions are (Chucky's solitary amusement, Glen/Glenda's true self revelation, Tiffany's involvement with a baster), the end-result is entertainment at its grade-B movie best.  Their itinerary to madness is filled with hilarious one-liners and over-the-top moments. Jennifer Tilly gives all she's got and comes out with flair and hilarity.  Not since Faye Dunaway's ""Mommy Dearest"" has an actress been so deliciously over-the-top.  Not to mention her colorful participation to one of the two DVD commentaries which is as enjoyable as the movie itself. In fact, DVD collectors will be in for a treat as SEED OF CHUCKY delivers tons of extra fun features, like the making of the film which reveals horror fetishes of Hairspray's director John Waters who has a cameo on the film, a behind-the-scenes look at two decades of Chucky films, a one on one interview with Chucky and the gang, a Chucky's Insider Facts on Demand which has over 150 trivia facts you never wanted to know about the plastic star, and the hoot of the bunch: a family ""Hell-iday"" slide show which quickly spiral into freaky zone.  Yes, compared to its ultra-cool 1998 prequel directed by Ronny Yu, SEED OF CHUCKY is a less than stellar vehicle, but as a stand alone film, this fourth sequel certainly rocks and shocks.-----Martin Boucher",1118188800,,2595,4.979214780600462

1503097,3,B00005JND2,"Coming 6 years after the incredibly fun and refrshing ""Bride Of Chucky"", which totally reinvented the series and was the most stylish ride thus far in the adventures of killer doll Chucky, 'Seed' fails to measure up to the visually funky and entertaining 1998 sequel. While this latest screamfest is definitley Chucky's sickest and twisted entry yet, there is something about it that's just not there. Something that keeps it from giving 'Bride' a run for it's money. That being said, it's still crazy, fun, and off the wall escapism. 'Seed' is a full blown self referential, movie within a movie, satire. This type of genre has been done to death here lately, but it's hilarious with what they do. Chucky and his bride Tiffany are resurrected once again by a living doll like themselves. Their child. The one that was born at the end of 'Bride'. Chucky has his boy Glen, and Tiffany think it's her girl, Glenda(get it?). Whatever the kid is, it looks like Howdy Doody and Michael Myers had a love child. Chuck and Tiff and the offspring find themselves in Hollywood, where actress Jennifer Tilly(who voices Tiffany)is appearing in a new movie being made about the devilish dolls. This sets in motion the fiendish twosome's plan to take over Tilly's body, and use her as a host mother to birth a human baby to give Glen(or Glenda)a real sex once and for all. Rapper Redman, also playing himself, gets into the mix as Tilly romances him for a part in his upcoming film about the Virgin Mary. What?, Method Man too busy?. Written by Don Mancini(who wrote the others)and directed by him for the first time, 'Seed', which was filmed in Romania, has an interesting look, but it's nowhere near as arresting as Ronny Yu's for 'Bride'. Still, as a first time director, he does an admirable job. Tilly, while she is supposed to be herself, is playing more of a character who just happens to be Jennifer Tilly. Some of the digs they get in at her own expense are hilarious and prove what a great trooper she really is. The astonishingly adorable Hannah Spearitt(of ""S Club 7"" fame)also stars as Joan, Tilly's assistant. Brad Douriff returns as the voice of Chucky(and who else could do it?), while The Lord Of The Rings' Billy Boyd voices Glen/Glenda. The high priest of camp, John Waters, has a brief appearance as a sleazy tabloid reporter. The film makes good use of it's inside jokes and personal jabs, and most of them are pretty funny. Chucky and Tiffany are interesting, but it's obvious that they, especially Chucky, are played for fun and high camp, since he has lost that creepy horror doll schtick a long time ago. The movie's theme of family strife is quite interestingly done, as Glen/Glenda figures out who he is, what he is, and how he, and he in his family, fits into the world. Quite an interesting piece of plot for a part 5 of a slashr series. Mancini himself said the movie is taking on other films like ""Ordinary People"". The extra features keep referring to Chucky doing this for 20 years. I believe the original came out in 1988, so it's 17 years. Someone's math is off. The movie is short and clever in places, and it doesn't make one's mind wander off. Although it would of been better if so much of it didn't take place in Tilly's house. The ending is quite off it's rocker, and a part 6 is already in the planning stages. After this ending, I can only imagine what sick place Mancini will take us next in the Chucky legacy. I think in the end, it's self referntial style and plain craziness just flies off the rails and it caves in on itself. All in all, it looks pretty good, and has some great comedic lines, but does not rise to the level of 'Bride'.",1118188800,3,3670,4.553706505295008
1503098,4,B00005JND2,"As a movie ""Seed of Chucky"" is a joke from start to finish, but that is okay because it is intended to be.  When Chucky first started killing people in ""Child's Play"" he was doing so in a horror movie.  But by the time we get to this 2004 film the point is no longer to freak anybody out with the idea of a child's doll running around stabbing people.  The point here is to have fun.  Granted, the fun here is sick and warped, but it is intentional and not by accident, and it is really not that extreme in a universe where Trey Parker and Matt Stone are running around making movies (""Seed of Chucky"" and ""Team America"" would be an interested double-bill to be sure).

Following up on the hard turn the series took in ""Bride of Chucky,"" this film begins with a young, orphaned doll (voiced by Billy Boyd) forced to work as a ventriloquist's dummy, who sees a story on the news about Hollywood's new horror film ""Chucky Goes Psycho.""  Figuring out that he must be related to Chucky and Tiffany, the doll heads for Los Angeles and uses that voodoo that works so well to turn the movie's puppets into daddy (voiced by Brad Dourif) and mommy (voiced by Jennifer Tilly).  Chucky thinks this is his son, a boy named Glen, but Tiffany, apparently a fan of Ed Wood movies, insist it is a daughter she named Glenda.  The bad news is not that they cannot tell their child's gender, but that Glen or Glenda does not want to be a homicidal maniac like his or her parents.  Where did these killer dolls go wrong?

However, there is a more important concern here as Chucky and Tiffany dream of becoming real people.  They decide to inhabit the bodies of Jennifer Tilly, playing herself as the star of ""Chucky Goes Psycho,"" and the rapper Redman, who is auditioning Tilly for the part of the Virgin Mary in the next movie he is directing.  ""Seed of Chucky"" justifies the fourth star simply because of Tilly's willingness to go along with the joke.  Her entire life, from her weight to her infamous lesbian scene with Gina Gershon in ""Bound,"" is fair game in this film.  This Tilly lives in a world where she is always second choice to Julia Roberts, which explains why she is willing to risk going to Hell by prostituting herself to get to play the Virgin Mary.  Then, adding insult to injury, Chucky and Tiffany plan to get Tilly pregnant, with or without her consent.

This is a post-modern film that just wallows in being self-referential.  The two moments that best evidence this are early on when Tilly complains that her career has sunk to the point where she is having sex with puppets and when Chucky breaks through a door with an ax and you know exactly what he is going to say, but he refuses to say it.  The plot by writer-director Don Mancini his problematic, but the whole point is to set up scenes in which a pair of killer puppets get to make bad jokes, so it seems insensitive to complain about plot holes.  Besides, it is impossible to watch this movie and be offended by it by mistake.  The title is ""Seed of Chucky"" and the tagline is ""Get a load of Chucky.""  How can you not know exactly what you are getting into with this one and to avoid it if is not your cup of tea (speaking metaphorically).",1118102400,,3202,4.375

You figure; you've got a  couple of dolls possessed by murderous spirits and who somehow go around murdering people for fun and right away you can forget all about suspension of disbelief. Anything is okay here, since the premise is so absurd. This is not a horror film, it is primarily a comedy with a bit of blood. And Jennifer Tilly is hysterical as herself playing the screen idea of herself: on a diet, sneaking candy bars, ready to play a sexy version of the Virgin Mary for a film done by Rapper Redman.  It is so good to see a gorgeous woman on screen who doesn't look like she's starving to death.

And, oh, yeah, the special effects are incredible. All done with puppets, not CGI. Very impressive. For this alone, all you guys out there studying film, this film is worthwhile.

The tongue and cheek humour flows, with campy wit and the outragous gore, such as the scene with the dismembered head flying up at the camera and bouncing on the floor. This could remind the viewer (and rightfully so) of an Evil Dead II-like sort of laugh fest. With its odd camara angles, quirky dialoge and over the top gore this horror comedy at its best",1117152000,,443,4.285714285714286
1503206,3,B00005JND2,"Whenever a horror film involves killer dolls, a high camp factor is sure to ensue.  However, the first three Chucky films (then known as Child's play) actually were semi-serious horror films.  Humor and camp were always present but were still a background drop to what were essentially still horror films meant to give the viewer some jolts.  After the 3rd Child's Play, a mediocre effort at best, the franchise seemed ready to die a slow death.  Director Ronny Yu's film Bride of Chucky, the fourth in the franchise, changed all of that.  Yu injected his film with atmosphere, style and outrageous humor that reinvigorated the franchise.  The film added another doll, a female lover companion to chucky and made these dolls the centerpiece of the film, instead of the first 3 where Chucky was a seldom-seen spooky doll that only appeared at the most inadvertent moments.  The fifth film in this series, &#8220;Seed of Chucky&#8221; goes one step above Yu's film to pump the camp factor thousandfold.  It's an amusing entry however I'm convinced after watching Seed of Chucky that the franchise will never be able to recover from the ridicule certain to be bestowed upon it by genre fans.

Anyone who saw Bride of Chucky will never forget the site of dolls Chucky and Tiffany getting down and doing the nasty, a graphic scene that was depicted in all of its plastic glory.  Seed of Chucky introduces us to the offspring of this unholy mating, a sex-less, compassionate and confused doll named Glenda.  In the movie's prelude Glenda is stuck in Glastonbury, England working as a puppet ventriloquist for an ingrate slavemaster.  One night while in his cage, he sees a show about Chucky and his bride on T.V. and immediately recognizes them as what must be his parents.  He manages to flee his cage and flies to Hollywood to meet his parents.  His parents, of course are long asleep, but he manages to reawaken them by reticing the famous Chucky voodoo prayer.  Soon, Chucky and Tiffany are awake again and eagerly slaying their way through Tinseltown.  Their goal this time is for Chucky to enter the body of film producer/rapper Redman and for Tiffany to enter the body of actress Jennifer Tilly (she of the monstrous bosom).

The good news about Seed of Chucky is that many of the same players return namely good ol' Brad Dourif as the voice of the Chuckster and Jennifer Tilly as herself/Tiffany.  However Ronny Yu is no longer at the director's chair, now replaced with Don Mancini.  Mancini, I must say probably has no respect for this franchise whatsoever or has forgotten what has made it so successful in the first place.  This franchise used to consist of horror films not straight comedy spoofs!  This entry veers into such a ridiculous amount of camp and self-referentiality it can no longer be considered horror.  We get Chucky and Tiffany with their own TV shows, endless cracks about Jennifer Tilly's career, countless gags about other famous celebrities such as Martha Stewart, etc.  If anything, this film reminded me of Broken Lizard's Club Dread or Scary Movie rather than any other entry in the chucky series.

What I did enjoy was the very generous amounts of gore.  If anything this film had more gore than any other entry of the series, and that is its only saving grace to horror film fans.  Sadly, Seed of Chucky is not nearly as stylish or as good a film as Bride of Chucky, which had a high camp/laugh factor but that at least never completely abandoned the horror spirit.  Seed of Chucky has a ludicrous storyline, little suspense and is not in the least bit scary.  Still, I'd be lying if I said it's not downright funny.  I busted my gut laughing several times and if you have the least bit of a sense of humor so will you.",1115683200,7,3751,4.71889400921659
1503207,3,B00005JND2,"Well, I didn't HATE it, per se.

First off, yes, this is completely opposite of every other Chucky movie in existence.  It completely changes directions and takes us somewhere we never thought Chucky would take us...namely, the bathroom.  Bathroom humor and gross out moments abound in this latest installment of the little doll's bloody rampage.  I could have done without the masturbating, the EXTENSIVE use of foul language, and all the ""ha-ha"" Jennifer Tilly in-jokes.  I think Miss Tilly took the writing reigns for her character way more than she should have.  The movie itself is shocking (but not in a good way) and relies too heavily on the depravity of its audience (also not in a good way).

All that said, however, I have to say that I loved the story.  I thought that this was a great way to wrap up the ""Chucky gets a lady"" story arc and I hope and PRAY that creator Don Mancini will be able to take his creation back to its horror roots.  I appreciate that you can't seriously have a little killer doll for five movies without becoming campy and he played on that.  Bravo for taking lemons and making it into lemonade.  But the lemonade is getting a little too sour and now methinks he should switch to lemon drops.  Something new, something re-creating, something that takes Chucky in, still yet, another new direction sans his nagging wife and their son/daughter.  I heard of a rumor about ""A Clockwork Orange"" take and I think that, if done straight, it could be a very engaging next chapter.  All in all, I liked the story for this movie and Chucky's destiny altering decision at the climax was well worth the price of admission for me, but the Hollywood in-jokes and American Pie humor went out with Kevin Williamson, I thank you.",1115078400,,1750,4.621359223300971

Sure it had funny moments, and cameos that made no sense, but the whole plot of the child of chucky was odd. How the young gender confused doll was raised in England and what happend to the detective he attacked on ""the bride of Chuky"" at the end of the movie is not answered. Then Jenifer Tilly theactress acting as herself,gets chosen o be the serrogate mother for chucky's child.

  I was mostly confused on the birth of the twins that had no doll characteristics whatsoever. In all i wonder what were they thinking in trying to squeeze one more Chucky Movie in,when the rest were so good.

I hope another chucky film comes after this one, as I cannot wait to get it on DVD. However, I would recommend everyone to get this DVD, as it is funny and a great laugh. I would not recommend viewing it to children under the age of 17 as it has a few bits, which children should not watch, but overall it is great.",1112832000,,501,4.02
1503323,4,B00005JND2,"You know when the tagline of a movie is ""Get a load of Chucky"" that you can't take the movie too seriously.  When you get into the movie and the child of Chucky and Tiffany is a genderly confused doll who can't decide if he/she should be Glen or Glenda (an homage to notoriously bad director Ed Wood's movie Glen or Glenda), that you are in camp territory.

But this isn't a bad place to be when you are the 5th in a series of monster movies about a doll possessed by a killer.  Unlike Friday the 13th movies and Halloween movies that keep churning out movies with the same premise as the last one, Seed of Chucky fully embraces the humor that was first evident in Bride of Chucky.

Some of the funniest moments stem from Tiffany's desire to raise a ""normal"" family.  To do so, she comes to the realization that she can't keep killing people.  She admits she's addicted to killing and goes on the whole 12 step program.  One of the best scenes involves a telephone call to a 12 step program and the idea that ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" and that it's okay to have a ""little slip.""

Another humorous touch was incorporating director John Waters as a prying reporter.  John Waters, known for his NC-17 films and others (Serial Mom, Pecker) adds a certain kind of camp to the movie.

In fact, I laughed so much at this movie that I feel compelled to give it 4 stars, as surprised as I am.  And, if anything in the previous paragraphs made you smile then you will definitely like this movie.  Per my review guide, a 4 star film is definitely worth checking out if you like the genre and is possibly worth buying.  If you like your horror with a lot of camp and some self-referential humor then this is a movie for you.

*On a side note, one wonders where the unrated version of the film went.  Don Mancini, not two months ago, said there was footage that didn't make the theatrical cut to keep the R rating and that an unrated or NC-17 version would hit on DVD...haven't seen it since then but with all of the ""unrated"" movies coming out I wouldn't be surprised if one pops up eventually.

Seed of Chucky is about the child that Tiffany had with Chucky, and while it may not be as good as Bride of Chucky, it has some fine moments. Is their offspring a boy or a girl?  Well, you decide!  If you do not go in expecting to see fine cinema, then you will be ok.  If you go in with the hope of a laugh or two, then you are set.  The Tiffany doll really steals the show, she has so many amusing facial expressions.  Well done to Jennifer Tilley who has provided the voice.

1503328,4,B00005JND2,"With a series that has moved further and further from horror roots and into severe camp, I wondered if I would like this movie.  After all, the director/writer had to know that this whole idea is ludicrous.  Thankfully, this movie did not disappoint me because it knew it was being campy and never once took itself seriously.

From the very beginning, the audience knows not to take the movie too seriously.  When the son of Chucky and Tiffany does not know if he is a boy or a girl (Glen or a Glenda), the movie makes homage to Ed Wood (fabuously horrible director, rated worst director ever).  By incorporating cult director John Waters as a sleazy reporter looking to score, this campy feeling is firmly established.  I honestly laughed most of the way through the movie in disbelief that this was actually happening.

The best parts deal with Chucky and Tiffany's concern over raising Glend/a in a violent family.  Tiffany decides that it's time to stop the killing and try and be a normal family so as to not screw up their genderly confused child.  This involves calling a 12 step hotline (she's addicted to killing), having ""little slips"" and realizing that Rome was not built in a day.

If anything in the previous paragraphs makes you smirk or even chuckle, or if you find humor when movies are self-referential in their humor, then you will find this movie to be very funny.  You can't take it seriously so don't even try.",1107993600,10,1432,4.642857142857143
1503329,4,B00005JND2,"The reviews this movie has received in local papers & whatnot hasn't been good. And the more of them I read the more I started leaning towards this film being absolutely no good. But also hanging onto the hope that like many times the person writing that review is the same moron who gave Titanic 5 stars.

Within the first 5 minutes of the film I was starting to think maybe the reviews where right, most of them said the first half of the movie was ok, but the second half failed, well I couldn't disagree more with those Entertainment Tonight supporting brain dead hypocrites.

The movie starts off by introducing Glen / Glenda who is the baby we saw Tiff give birth to in the predecessor ""Bride Of Chucky / Childs Play 4"". As explained in the movie Glen/da was found by a man in a cemetery (referring to the resting place of Chucky from B.O.C) who named him something that Amazon will remove if I write it (psst, the initials are S.H, work it out) and adopted him in a way, he doesn't exactly care for him he uses him as a ventriloquists act in a freak show and keeps Glen/da locked in a cage where he abuses him. Glen/da always has wondered who his parents where and he escapes the clutches of the man abusing him and travels to America to find his parents. And when Glen/da does find his parents he finds that they are being used as the actual dolls in a Hollywood movie based on the Chucky and Tiff legends, but they are not alive.

My guess is whoever found the dolls in the cemetery where they died in B.O.C for some reason decided to use the actual dolls to make the movie with and decided to melt down the actual plastic of Tiff that was burnt to a crisp and remould Tiff to look the way before she was toasted in the last half of B.O.C. (I sort of had a problem with that bit myself, but moving on) Glen/da finds his parents in the set's warehouse at night and brings them back to life with the amulet. And then from there on Chucky and Tiff are back again and ready to do what they do best, only they discover Glen/da is there son, or daughter, there not sure!!! (See the movie for that to make sense)

From there on Chucky is killing everyone again, Tiff is trying to give up killing to be a good mother and the kid doesn't know if he is male or female, tho has a very unusual split personality for about 15 seconds on the screen that I don't know what was supposed to be about? Maybe to do with the ending and it was split between them or something? (See the movie and that will make sense, I just don't want to spoil the plot)

There is some nice decapitations and blood spurting around the floor to satisfy the horror movie buff. And there is also that smart*** humour of Chuckey's that always makes me laugh. I wish he was in this world to do what he does to Brittany Spears in this movie!!!!

Forget the stupid critics and article magazine reviewers, they obviously don't enjoy a good horror movie, and they wouldn't know a good one if it was directed by Spielberg himself. This movie holds it's flame up amongst the previous 4 films and is there to stay. It started off a bit wonky but once you work out what's going on, you sit back and relax and enjoy the film instead of looking for continuity errors. There is a lot more blood and gore this time then the last film, infact I'd say this movie is the best for it, Chucky finally has some great killing scenes to recap on later.
If you liked the Child's play series then I don't see why this one wouldn't be accepted as the 5th instalment. If you don't like them, why are you even reading this review? Just rate it a ""NO"" and go away.

I think this has been the best horror movie this year. Entertaining, funny, gory, I dunno about frightening, nothing frightens me, well, except seeing Michael Jackson's latest face. So I don't know if anybody will feel suspense or frightened in this film, but man did I have a good laugh at some things in this film. Some say it has INSIDE joke's... well I thought it was pretty damn funny what the paparazzi guy got in the end!!!!

Personally, I can't wait for this to be on DVD to buy and put with my other Chucky DVD's. and also see what bonus features will come with it.

Update Edit for DVD reveiw.

The DVD looks and sounds great, and the film is still a great 4 star movie to me.

I'm a bit ticked off with the Australian release tho. (regioun 4) It does not have any deleted scenes. The US version mentions the cut scene, and it probably has the rest hidden as eggs. Damn it, why hasn't the region 4 version got the cut scenes... and it only has one commentary track with the producer and the lovely Jennifer Tilly, but it really is annoying that during there commentary they mention the other stuff on the DVD, but they arnt on the region 4 release. Why cant ALL version be the same release everywhere, why cut stuff out???

Hopefully this movie will get a directors cut release someday.

She gets to make fun of herself again in this movie, as if she's doing the gossip on herself for the audience's pleasure. I have a feeling that she's going to do one more Chucky movie in a few years.

Since I had no expectation for this film to be scary, and I enjoyed the previous installments, because they are so cheessy, so all the silly, stupid, and bad taste jokes just worked right on! In this movie, Hollywood is doing a biopic on Chucky and Tiffany, and Jennifer Tilley does the voice over for Tiffany. Meanwhile, their offspring, a genderless Glen/Glenda escaped from the circus in the UK. He saw the pictures of Chucky, and headed to LA to find his parents. He spoke in a British accent and he was Made In Japan just like Chucky. He tracked down his parents bodies in storage room in a Hollywood studio, and he performed a vitual to revive them. The three of them escaped, and headed to Jennifer Tilley's place, because Chucky wanted to get her drunk and make her pregnant!

Chucky was torn between his/her mother and father, because they have ideas to change him. The mother wants him/her to be a girl, and Chucky wants him/her to be a guy a bloody killer, but Glen/Glenda is such a gentle creature.

John Waters also has a part, and he plays a creepy tabnoid photographer on the hunt to take ""nasty"" pictures of Jennifer Tilley outside her house. He ended up taking pictures of Chucky masterbating, and Tiffany attacking Jennifer Tilley! Eventually Chucky and Glen/Glenda killed him in his darkroom.

Tilley got pregnant after artificial insemination from the dolls. Tiffany wanted to stop killing, and along with Glen/Glenda they had to stop Chucky from evil things...

So yeah, I did find this movie to be funnier than the previous Chuckies. It's more disturbing, because it's got some ""dirty"" contents unlike the previous ones. Chucky's gone too horny and silly!",1104624000,,2108,4.640750670241287

Tom Holland is talented director, made Fright Night,so i was expecting a good movie. I got a great one. The first Child's Play is possibly one of the creepiest and nightmarish films i have ever seen. The doll is just brutal, the acting is terrific(I just love that Andy, perfect casting), and the bleak Chicago winter setting perfectly sets the mood for the story. Next we have Child's Play 2. Not as smart, horrifying, or dreary as the original, but still a damn good watch. Some crazy creepy deaths, a few laughs(though not enough to ruin the atmosphere), and Jenny Agutter from An American Werewolf in London is in it. The series goes down a bit with Look Who's Stalking. No Alex Vincent, too many funny lines, and pretty good kills, but nothing compared to the two previous films. The series goes downhill from there. We have Bride of Chucky(directed by Ronny Yu, director of the pretty good Freddy vs. Jason, but also director of the terrible Bride.... its not really worth typing out again), a movie that totally disgraces Chucky. He gets a bride(what the f--k?!) and they go on a killing spree. Thats the plot line. How original. THEN we have this utter piece of f--king trash. Terrible. The kills are unoriginal, the acting is horrid, redman is in it(thats almost as bad as putting Busta Rhymes in Halloween Ressurection, though not quite as bad because at least Redman is a respectable rapper and not a complete joke like Rhymes), and the special effects suck terribly. The dragqueen/king Glen(da) is incredibly annoying, Jennifer Tilly's fat ass sucks as the high pitched bride's voice(now i know why she is doing crappy sequels to great movies and isn't being cast for other stuff), and worst of all, Chucky is f--king ROMANTIC. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hopefully this shall be the last one made, so the chucky franchise can die somewhat respectably. There weren't many people in the theaters on opening day and everyone who was in there was laughing(except me, I was just pissed off). I suppose they should go ahead and put Chucky in the comedy section at the movie store. Wouldn't scare a 6 year old. Watch the first 2 Child's Plays, Fright Night, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday 13th, the Funhouse, the ORIGINAL Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Madman, The Burning, the Shining, Exorcist, or many others if you want a good horror movie, but trust me, it is quite safe to skip out on this one.

Well, I had such an enjoyable time watching this film, and laughing along with the rest of the audience, that I was inspired to rent Child's Play 1 & 2, and am looking forward to seeing #3 and ""Bride of Chucky"" as well. I am a new fan of the Chucky films. The introduction of Glen in this latest installment was a stroke of genius on the part of the writers. His deceptively innocent, passive-aggressive personality gives this story just the right amount of perverse humor. I was pleasantly surprised at the tasteful and artistic murders perpetrated by the killer dolls (ha,ha:), but felt that one flaw in the movie was not enough sex scenes and nudity. Maybe it was out of place in the original Child's Play movies, but Seed of Chucky has graduated to true campy status. Like Friday the 13th, once you get into the fourth and fifth episodes, it's time to unleash some enjoyable sex scenes and nude shots.

It's time to watch another slasher franchise bite the dust.

The franchise crashed & burned with part 2, but, it seems like people are hanging around after a bad accident waiting to see what will happen next.

Somehow, somewhere, both Chucky & Tiffany somehow have managed to have offspring (major league loophole, since both are deader than disco) & it shows up to kick off this crap filled bag of a film.

The seed of Chucky is named Glen or Glenda, which ever you prefer, and after it finds out about its birth parents, sets out to L.A. to find them (Glen/Glenda's current owner, a supposed ventriloquist, found it and took it back to Europe with him).

Once in L.A., Glen/Glenda finds out that what it saw back in Europe isn't actually its real parents but film props used for an upcoming film based on the exploits of Chucky and his bride. Glen/Glenda, through Chucky's evil amulet, brings both the real Chucky & Tiffany back from the dead & the splatter and gore begin. But when the two meet there offspring, Chuck & Tiff want more and decide to use, the lead star of the Chucky film, Jennifer Tilly (no complaint there!), as there surrogate dollmaker (eww, gross).

With the exception of the lead dolls wanting more kids, the plot is much like the other four films. Chucky with Tiffany want to use the voodoo spell to transfer there spirits into the bodies of other humans so both can wreak havoc, again & raise there children (the whole concept is retarded. Chuck wreaks just as much havoc as a doll than he ever would in human form).

Chucky's offspring is clearly retarded. I didn't buy the whole ""I don't want to kill"" motif and it was only a matter of time before Glen/Glenda would join the family business.

There is no redeeming scares in this film. The gore is a bit much (I'm a fan of good horror, but, filmmakers should know when to say when, when it comes to the gore quotient). A horror film should have enough gore in it, to justify it, not overglorify it.

The cast looks like it was thrown together with famous people stuck in a layover at the local airport (any film that stars Redman should automatically get one star taken off its rating. The guy sucks). Jennifer Tilly is great to look at, but, can't save the film (she needs a boost of self-esteem & self-confidence. She's a good actress, she just needs good roles. This ain't one of them).

Unscary, not to funny, and mostly just sitting there like a limp Raggedy Andy, ""Seed Of Chucky"" should be avoided like a weird Russian marionette Christmas play.",1100822400,3,2865,4.515444015444015
1503526,5,B00005JND2,"Perhaps you have to be a lifelong fan of Chucky and the ""Child's Play"" movies to appreciate the latest installment, ""Seed Of Chucky."" Afterall, this is one sick and twisted flick. Hatched by Chucky's creator turned director, Don Mancini, ""Seed"" tells the story of Chucky and Tiffany's illegitimate love-child Glen (or Glenda? God, I can't get enough of that) as voiced by ""Lord Of The Rings'"" Billy Boyd. Glen (or Glenda) is a gender confused human/doll hybrid who is forced into being a ventriloquist dummy somewhere in London (I'm guessing), is given an unsavory stage name and has the tendency to wet himself often. After catching a news piece about a movie being made in Hollywood about Chucky and Tiffany's exploits, Glen (or Glenda) ships himself to America and unknowingly resurrects the terrible two. As the plot thickens, the family hatches a plan to transfer themselves into the bodies of Jennifer Tilly (playing an excellently skewered version of herself) and rapper Redman (who is directing a biblical epic with Tilly trying for the coveted role of Virgin Mary). Obviously, everything about this movie begs you to stretch your suspension of disbelief. If you thought ""Bride Of Chucky"" was completely off the wall, this movie will send you to the sanitarium. But no matter how far it reaches, the movie still retains it's creativity (I have honestly never seen anything like this) and wit. Brad Dourif once again returns as Chucky, and we wouldn't have it any other way. My only gripe with this film is that the Chuckster's screen-time is limited. However, he provides many hilarious one-liners and at one point, even becomes the voice of reason. This movie will have you laughing uncontrollably at moments, especially with the nods to Tilly's lesbian flick ""Bound"" (especially the three-way phone call gag). Jennifer Tilly really shines through on this one, showcasing an unlimited sense of humor about herself. Don Mancini, who is the only person to have seen this series through the whole way, along with Dourif, really expresses his love for the characters. Once again, as with all four previous flicks, he wrote the script, and this truly is his world. His first time directing shows a lot of skill and style -- his only previous directing gigs are a ""Tales From The Crypt"" episode and the final birth scene in ""Bride Of Chucky"" (how perfect). Aside from Ronny Yu's job on the previous movie, this is the best looking of the series. It is definitely a fan flick, and is full to the brim with gore and good humor. It's not exactly scary, but anyone who is initiated in all things Chucky can appreciate it. Newcomers, however, might be disappointed. This is not for you.",1100736000,,2684,4.8881578947368425

1503529,3,B00005JND2,"Director Don Mancini's latest movie `Seed Of Chucky' is the fifth installment to the `Child Play' series, and a rather bizarre one at that.

The story starts off with Glen, a confused doll who, one day sees his parents Chucky and Tiffany in a movie. Running away from his vicious owner, he goes to Hollywood in search of them. Once he finds them and brings them to life, Chucky and Tiffany wish to exchange bodies with humans so that they can bring their next `seed' to the world, even if it means destroying whoever comes in their way.

After watching the movie, I found it to be average. Although there is a good mix of horror and dark humor involved, some of the scenes are just senseless (one that comes to my mind is towards the end where Glen becomes Glenda and gives us the `lady-killer' joke). Besides, some of the scenes are too grotesque to be even considered funny (for example, when Chucky mentions the skeletons in the closet and actually opens the closet). On the bright side, Jennifer Tilly's acting as herself and providing the voice of Tiffany was excellent. She was the main reason I even kept watching the movie.

On the whole, I consider this as a very ridiculous sequel (with a few good jokes) that is not properly prepared to become a hit.",1100390400,,1261,4.521929824561403
1503615,2,B00005JND2,"Continuing with the implausibility's which were liberally sprinkled throughout 1998's ""Bride of Chucky"" this series drags a once-clever sequel screaming down into the wasteland of late night b grade movies.

This installment finds Glen (who really is a 'good guy' dolly!) horrified by their exploits after he brings the infamous parents back to life. Chucky ironically is horrified that his child does not want to follow in the family business, while Tiffany is (of course) fascinated with Jennifer Tilly, who also supplies the doll's voice.

Since I don't care for Tilly either playing an unbalanced doll or in real life, this last plot (even by this movie's standards) was really worthless. It was just a mechanism to give Tilly more screentime.

The only really lasting impression of the movie was my wanting to remove Glen from that VERY dysfunctional home---and bring him to my own for safe keeping. I am certain that doll would like living with me much more than with parents wanting their kid to become evil and then hurt people. Unfortunately, I do not know if there is any Child Protective Services office in America which presently allows cross ""human-living dolly"" adoptions to be processed.

In an aside to Ed Wood, the gender of Glen is intentionally ambigous throughout the film. Since it's burried under a thick layer of camp, I am not certain if every theater patron will get the reference. Like Bride of Chucky, this screenplay obviously goes more for pop references immersed in dark humor.

Brad Dourif must really be hurting for money...etc if he is still headlining this series. What used to be a fairly chilling story has degenerated into something which probably could not scare my friend's two year old. I had never heard of Mr. Dourif before the `Childs Play' series and predict that this latest entry (guaranteed to flop in theaters) will further stigmatize him.

At least Billy Boyd (voice of Glen) and Tilly still have time to salvage the rest of their careers and/or get new agents who WOULD NOT have them involved in stuff like this. Perhaps this is a fluke on their own resumes.",1100390400,2,2108,4.890756302521009

1503617,1,B00005JND2,"In my many years of watching horror, and horror sequels, I have to say that this is the WORST franchise sequel I have ever seen.  That would include the ""Children of the Corn"" series and yes, even ""Hellraiser"" direct-to-video sequels.  I was very suprised that I hated this film.  I enjoyed ""Bride of Chucky.""  I thought it was inventive and fresh.

What this slop is defies words.  All involved should be ashamed of themselves.  This is a prime example how you can go one movie too far; overstay your welcome as it were.  The characters, especially Glen (or is it Glenda?) are too weird and unattached to the original story.  I realize the Glen/Glenda thing is suppossed to be a tribute to Ed Wood.  Come on!  This film has too many references, with a screenplay so weak it can't hold them together.  It steals from ""Scream 3"" with the movie within a movie deal, and the ending doen't make any sense.

Please!  Lets stop the lame sequels!  It's OK to add humor to an aging franchise.  But people please, casting John Waters is so obviously campy, it borders on ridiculous, silly, and just plain stupid.  The direction is misguided.  One minute its a serious horror movie with gore and shocks, the next its a lame attempt at slapstick.  Really bad jokes, horrible dialog, and one dimensional support characters who only serve as something to kill and nothing more.  Jennifer Tilly even looks tired, no wait, bored.  So very, very bored.  As was I.  Lets hope that Chucky is finally dead.  This movie should finally keep him dead and buried.",1100304000,3,1540,4.639405204460966

You have the unsuspecting victims being silently stalked by a evil force that wants to enialate them. That works for me and when that is challenged I gotta pass on it.

I loved every childs play movie but part 3, SO i was rather excited at the fact they were doin another one. With the introduction of Glen their whatever (i think son) I was excited about the possibility. But the premise of putting them in hollywood just seeems wrong. It seems extremely campy in a bad way.
