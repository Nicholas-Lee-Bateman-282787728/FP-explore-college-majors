8218580,3,B000VGB016,"I would not recommend this video to seasoned exercisers, but those new to hand weights and cardio would benefit. I really enjoy Gin Miller's laid back personality and humor in the videos I have seen her in. This video was a big disappointment for me, but it still gave me a workout with enough weight and enough imnprovising in the cardio bonus.",1296604800,,345,4.580645161290323
8218581,4,B000VGB016,"This dvd consists of 2 parts...about 25 minutes of dumbbells then a 20 minute cardio workout.  I have not used the cardio portion as I run plenty of miles already so I can't review that portion.  However, I gave the dumbbell workout 4 stars as it was good but I didn't like all of the moves (the ones where you needed to use a chair).  I also have trouble doing lunges because of my knees and unfortunately for me she does quite a few in one section, so I do other exercises at this point.  The squat portion is pretty good, she combines part of the squat section with an overhead press and once the arms have gotten their workout you do just squats.  She does a move to work out your back (I believe it's called a reverse fly but I could be wrong), a move for your shoulders, biceps, triceps, calves, core, and butt.  I already do a pretty intense dumbbell lifting routine 2-3 times a week and found certain moves to be too easy.  However if you are a beginner this would be the perfect place to start!  She gives tips on how to hold your body and what muscles to focus on.  Even if you're past the beginner stage, this is a good lifting routine for those light days!  On a side note, she does occasionally stretch throughout the workout which gives you a bit of rest time between moves.  I found Gin Miller very refreshing as an instructor and she adds a bit of humor in every now and again!  This is my only Gin Miller dvd but she does a good enough job that I would buy other workout dvds by her.  During the workout she is the only one there, no back up people to show modifications of certain moves (which she could have used for at least two of the moves).  Overall a good dvd, I found mine at Wal Mart on sale for $3.00 and it was well worth it!",1270944000,5,1753,4.132743362831858
