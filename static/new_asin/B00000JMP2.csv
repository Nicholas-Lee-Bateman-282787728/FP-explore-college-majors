7913006,2,B00000JMP2,"This Middle Man title is actually more appropriate for In the Line of Duty IV. This movie starts out with a decent fight scene and its all down hill from there. Its more of a drama about people who are friends of friends in this movie. Cynthia Khan has a relative who has friends that are into some information smugglin and thats basically her beef to get into a lot of the action in this movie. Like others stated this film has very little to do with the original series theres absolutely no comedy as in other installments its a very serious drama and not enough action for me. I really stopped paying attention because of how boring this film was, i mean you can get up and go get something to eat and you won't miss much. This one doesn't measure up to the rest, If you want to watch a good ITLOD series i'd go for 4 or 2.

Pros: Cynthia Khan

Cons: Too much drama, Not Enough Action, Fights were poorly choreographed, Story and plot were very weak.",1275868800,,953,4.259668508287293
7913007,2,B00000JMP2,"MIDDLE MAN (1990) is the fifth and arguably weakest entry in the famed IN THE LINE OF DUTY series of Hong Kong films about hard-kicking, gun-toting HK policewomen, although it does offer a lot of action scenes featuring star Cynthia Khan. The barely comprehensible storyline has to do with U.S. military secrets being sold to foreign buyers using a multinational gang based in Korea. Cynthia plays a Hong Kong cop whose cousin, an American serviceman (David Wu), turns to her for help when he's implicated in the plot. This slim peg is the excuse for a steady stream of scenes of Cynthia shooting, kung fu fighting, leaping, running, chasing, and performing all kinds of pretty dangerous stunts on location in both Hong Kong and Korea. The pace never flags and Cynthia delivers the goods. However, unlike IN THE LINE OF DUTY IV, in which she was partnered with Donnie Yen, she's pretty much on her own here, with no major fighting co-stars. The only other faces familiar to HK fans are Lo Lieh (FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH), as an aging gang boss who barely gets involved in the action, and Billy Chow (FIST OF LEGEND), who has one smashing good fight scene with Cynthia in a spacious modern private home.
Many of Cynthia's opponents are Caucasian and a lot of English is spoken on the Cantonese track of this DVD. Her most formidable such foe is Kim Maree Penn, an attractive Australian blonde who gives Cynthia a run for her money in the final fight staged in a display room filled with glass cases ripe for breaking.",1056499200,,1513,4.670411985018727
