8193295,4,B000PU112G,"""Attack of the Swamp Creature"" is a terrible movie that marauds under many names, all of them equally ridiculous (at a minimum ""Blood Waters of Dr. Z"", ""Zaat"", ""Legend of the Zaat Monster"", ""Hydra"", and ""Dr. Z""; who knows if there are more). I have seen it under three of the titles, and like it best as ""Blood Waters of Dr. Z"" mostly because of the ludicrous opening monologue which is missing from some versions, including this one (""Sargassm! Weed of deceit!"")

The movie follows the exploits of an insane scientist, Dr. Kurt Leopold (Marshall Grauer; a question - why Dr. Z if the scientist is Dr. L?) who lives and works in the most depressing surroundings I have ever seen (Coleman Francis would have loved it). He was mocked by his colleagues and is now out for vengeance. Obviously his course is clear: he turns himself into a fish monster via the most ludicrous scientific methods since Ed Wood directed Bela Lugosi. There's a government department, INPIT, that deals with such matters on his trail; they team up with an obtuse sheriff (Paul Galloway), and a marine biologist to solve the case of the murdering mackerel, and after a couple of subplots involving race relations and a frightening would-be romance, the film reaches it's obvious conclusion.

This film has everything for a B-movie addict, and it's the real deal: the film is played completely straight with apparent cluelessness that they are making some truly abominable cinema. I have seen this version and ""Zaat"", which are nearly identical, and ""Blood Waters of Dr. Z"", which has the delicious monologue about deceit and aquatic plants, and prefer the latter. A word of warning: this film is only for diehard fans of truly wretched cinema as it will be way too trying for anyone else. I gave the film four stars for appalling production values, a completely insane premise, awful acting and direction, and some of the worst dialogue in film history.

If you just can't watch this without some help, I recommend buying the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XVII"" set, which contains ""Blood Waters of Dr. Z"" along with a great assortment of mockery for the film (which is, incidentally, one of my favorite episodes). Trust me, this movie is infinitely more palatable with the MST3K treatment, but if you are determined to try it on your own I wish you luck. You're going to need it.",1280620800,3,2361,4.796068796068796
8193296,1,B000PU112G,"Zaat (Don Barton and Arnold Stevens, 1975)

The hive mind at IMDB calls Zaat the ninth-worst film of all time. Of course, the hive mind at IMDB is the film equivalent of Oprah's book club; there is a hardcore group who simply gave a 1-star rating to anything that ever appeared on Mystery Science Theater 3000, most of them without ever seeing the full versions of the movies in question. In some cases, this leads to movies garnering far worse reputations than they should actually have (Manos, the Hands of Fate, currently listed at #7, is a far better film than Zaat, for example--though I use the term ""better"" relatively here); for obvious reasons, MST3K only looked at films up through a certain time period (according to one bit of trivia at IMDB, only seven films from the nineties were ever features), and to the best of my knowledge, nothing on the show was ever direct to video. The combination of these two factors obviously excludes the worst excesses of the new century's direct-to-video horror films; there are easily one hundred of those alone worse than anything that can be sound on IMDB's bottom hundred list. Well, to qualify that, of the films of the Bottom 100 that I've seen, there are a whole lot worse.

Zaat is the exception to that rule. Everything about this movie is execrable, from its original concept all the way through its final execution, this was the most ill-thought project I've ever run across with the arguable exception of Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter. I mean, how many drugs must have been involved in a production where an evil scientist was supposed to turn himself into a walking catfish and ended up looking like a rubber lamprey who'd just swallowed a toolbox?

In any case, if I haven't already told you enough of it, the plot: mad scientist (Marshall Grauer) turns himself into a giant fish-man (who was played not by Grauer, but by Wade Popwell) in order to get revenge on those who would not fund his experiments to create a race of fish-men to conquer the universe. Nice circular logic, that. On the way to his world domination, however, he needs a way to propagate the fish-man race, so he tries to create a fishwife (trust me, that joke is better than anything in this movie). So this is a movie about a serial killer fish-man chasing bathing beauties. All of which would lead me to simply laughing derisively at it if that weren't the exact one-sentence summary of Corman's Humanoids from the Deep, which came out five years later. Could this piece of overcooked sweetbreads have actually been... influential?

I can't provide you with an answer to that question, but there seem to be too many thematic similarities for Corman not to have seen this piece of pure foolishness. (And as stupid as Humanoids from the Deep is, if Corman decided to do an uncredited remake of this mess, he did it a whole lot better.) After all, it would be pretty hard to make a movie worse than Zaat; very few of these people ever went onto other movie jobs, and for very good reason. And I'm not just talking cast here; the writers, the director, the set designer, the key grip... I mean, the most experienced person on the set was the makeup artist, who'd worked on Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things two years previous. In the days before direct-to-video, how in the world did this turkey get released? That is a question whose answer may be lost to the mists of time, as this movie should be. It is stunningly awful in every respect. The script, the acting, the direction, the creature effects, the kit and kaboodle. One of the few film's on IMDB's 100 Worst list that actually deserves to be there. (half)",1260403200,,3649,4.643962848297214
8193297,3,B000PU112G,"I can't believe people are selling used VHS copies of this film for $80.

I bought this film, under the title HYDRA, maybe 15 or 20 years ago, on VHS, for $2.88.  A bargain bin film, with washed out colors.

It's a really bad film.  I gave it 3 stars because I'm forgiving; I have a soft spot for crappy horror.  But this is not a great horror film, not historically important, not a seminal film in horror history.  And there are tons of 1970s horror films much better.

It has a really bad no-name ""actor"" playing a mad scientist.  This guy never talks; we only hear his voiceovers (probably by another actor).  He goes on and on talking about his brilliant plan to turn himself into a walking catfish, so he can kill all his scientist colleagues who scoffed at his brilliant plan.  The lab looks like, I dunno, a basement boiler room?

Real Mystery Science Theater 3000 kind of stuff.

There's a sexy no-name actress, who plays some sort of government scientist.

And a long interlude of hippies singing folk songs.  A sheriff arrests them and they come along peacefully.  They walk through town to jail, singing along the way.  None of this relates to the film's monster catfish story.

The monster is a stiff rubber suit, lumbering along.

A bad film, but hardcore horror fans may want to see it.  But it's hardly worth $80.  I recommend that people wait for a DVD release, or for sellers to bring the price down to maybe $8.",1251504000,3,1430,4.4689922480620154
