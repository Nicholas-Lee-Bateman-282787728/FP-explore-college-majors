831543,4,6304285396,"This is a delightful film for folks of all ages.  The Glad Game is not a game -- it's a way of life, a positive attitude.  When young Pollyanna and her father were disappointed that the package from a missionary relief  organization contained not a doll but crutches, they determined they would  find something to be glad about.  After a bit of thought, they decided to  be glad they didn't NEED the crutches!  At the end of the show, though,  when Pollyanna is unable to walk due to an injury sustained falling from a  tree, you have to think she would have been glad to have had those  crutches.",953683200,9,597,4.394495412844036

831738,4,6304285396,"The discs come in a plastic snap case and play fine. This is a great family movie. I recommend some television series that are just as good or better: Anne of Green Gables (1985), Anne of Green Gables the Sequel (1987), Anne of Avonlea (1975), When Calls the Heart (2014- ), and Anne With an E (2017- ). All of the series feature wonderful locations and great characters, but the newest series have the best production values, best colors, etc., due to digital technology. I like them all.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,2,1919,5.520408163265306

832350,5,6304285396,"So nice to see a ""glad"" movie in a time that was so trying, right after the ""gay"" '90's thatu I believe is what they were referred to, but because of moral issues, which I am not criticizing, God was lambasted from the pulpit (hellfire & brimstone), instead of being portrayed as the loving God He truly is.  Pollyanna shows us happiness in the face of danger and sadness, which is what Jesus & the movies message is all about.  Pollyanna continues with her positive attitude and caringness throughout the movie, despite the negative attitudes of her aunt and Angelica the house maid.  Agnes Moorhead, plays one of the local townspeople, who believes she is sick and dying, but Pollyanna's positive attitude brings her back from the brink of death.  Other outstanding  performances include Karl Malden, as the. local pastor.  All in all, a wonderful, feel good afternoon movie, well deserved of it's G rating. And with excitement enough to go around., Good, high, flying fun.  A kids movie that kids and parents will enjoy, back to an innocent time... very refreshing.",1497312000,,1068,4.835164835164835

832355,2,6304285396,"I watched the truly wonderful PBS 2004 remake with Amanda Burton first, and it instantly became one of my most favorite movies.  Months later I decided to watch the Mills version since it had received high ratings.  Frankly I'm speechless, since Pollyanna and every other character in the Mills version are poorly cast, the orchestral accompaniment annoying, and the overall movie boring.  If you give each movie the five minute test, the 2004 remake is engaging right from the start, while the Mills Disney version features a boy irrelevantly rolling a hoop  through a village, and then playing with flattening objects on the rail of a railroad track.  Pollyanna is a such an extraordinary feel-good story when done well, and only the PBS version succeeds.  It may be that some of the folks giving high ratings to the Mills version had never seen the PBS version.",1496448000,,864,4.883561643835616

I started the movie after that & the rest of the movie was fine.  The children enjoyed comparing the book to the movie, the most shocking to them was Agnes Morheads character with red hair- it's black in the book.

The adventures series of the 50s (Treasure Island, 20000 Leagues ... ) were some beautiful, lush ""boy"" stories put to film, with memorable characters, but I (having been a boy, growing up with the original ""Wonderful World of Disney"") never felt there was much depth, really, with most of the films. ""Pollyanna"" (1960) has a more well-rounded character, with Hayley Mills perfectly cast. I'd seen it years ago and viewed it now with my wife, who also enjoyed it. We tend to pick lighter subjects when we both have an afternoon off in the spring or summer, with nothing else planned. Another one of our picks was ""The Parent Trap"" (1961), also with Mills.",1474761600,,704,4.685483870967742

833490,1,6304285396,"This one star review is NOT for the film itself, which is an undisputed classic, but for Amazon's streaming version of it. I rented this as an experiment to see how much of an HD presentation I would get over the standard definition DVD I already own. What I got was an awful, choppy, unwatchable mess that was worse then an old worn out VHS tape.

Amazon claims that if your wireless speed is not up to snuff, you will only get the film streamed in ""standard definition"". If what I got was their standard definition I don't hold out much hope on what their HD version would be like. While I don't have the fastest internet speed available, I get Netflix, Vudu and Hulu movies streamed just fine, and in FULL HD. So for Amazon to claim that my internet connection was not good enough to receive this film in HD is pure hogwash.

Needless to say, I won't be renting or purchasing anymore films from Amazon until I can get to the bottom of what's causing the problems.",1469232000,,966,4.361111111111111

The movie version is more for adults than for kids.  All the negativity that occurred within the book with the different characters was highlighted in the movie version so the movie version is just very negative.  My advice is to stick with the book and never bother with the movie version.  Haley Mills is a lovely actress but the movie is not good.",1450828800,2,519,4.586956521739131

835302,5,6304285396,"""Every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful impulse behind in the world, and bettered the tradition of mankind.""-Robert Louis Stevenson
  In honor of her 69th birthday, I pay homage to Hayley Mills  in her inaugural starring role as Eleanor H. Porter's sunny orphan, Pollyanna Whittier, the daughter of deceased missionary parents in the British West Indies, who ameliorates the lives of those she encounters in Harrington Town, the Maryland town named for her late grandfather when she goes to live with her  wealthy, elegant, but parsimonious aunt, Polly Harrington(Jane Wyman) circa 1912.
 There is a noticeable dourness about the town as on the same day Pollyanna steps off the train, a former flame of her aunt's, Dr. Edmund Chilton (Richard Egan, with whose niece I attended school) also arrives in town.
  Amelia Tarbell(Anne Seymour), Polly Harrington's closest friend, advises the young girl to be sufficiently appreciative of her' aunt's taking her in.
  Driven to her aunt's mansion, the young girl is excited to have a new life despite the grumpiness of her aunt's maids, Angelica( Mary Grace Canfield), Nancy( Nancy Olson), and her cook, Tillie Lagerlorf( Reta Shaw).
  When Aunt Polly delineates what is expected of her niece as a member of the town's most prominent family, Pollyanna sees right through her and points out that she's ""not supposed to be glad that we're so very rich"".
 Pollyanna, enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to have new clothes . But while at the dress shop supervising the purchase of her niece's new wardrobe, Aunt Polly is called away to deal with a crisis-namely the explosion of a water main in the local orphanage. The town's mayor(Donald Crisp) has long complained that the building is inadequate for 32 children, and continues his futile plea for a new orphanage at a meeting at Polly's house.
 In the meantime, while Pollyanna and Nancy were en route home, George Dodd(James Drury), Nancy's sweetheart, whom she is forbidden to see while an employee of Polly Harrington's , secretly treats them to ice cream sodas. Pollyanna covers for Nancy when they return home late.
 The Sunday church service, during which  Tillie plays the organ, gives further illumination  for the town's sober mood. Reverend Paul Ford(Karl Mulden), who has served in the town for four years, bellows sermons of fire and brimstone from the pulpit, emphasizing Man's doom, along the lines of Jonathan Edwards' ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"", at Polly's behest. Until an afterthought chat with a certain minister's daughter, in which it is recommended that he bring a bit more gladness and reflection of God's love into his messages, his congregation will view him as inapproachable when they feel the need for his counsel on local and spiritual matters.
 Pollyanna's amiability will also win her the friendship of the scampering young orphan, Jimmy Bean(Kevin Corcoran), the hypochondriac, Mrs. Snow(Agnes Moorehead), and  the wealthy but mysterious town recluse, Mr. Pendergast (whom, via Adolphe Menjou's portrayal , will prove to be a big kid himself). The former's frazzled  caretaker daughter, Mildred(Jenny Egan) will be especially  grateful for that.
 It is while visiting Mrs. Snow carrying out her aunt's required tasks of false charity ( for which Dr. Chilton criticized Polly), that Pollyanna reveals the origin of The Glad Game she has encouraged others in town to play--explaining how a member of a missionary family who was deprived of many things, her father taught her to find things to be glad about . In the process, a certain undertaker(Gage Clarke) loses a sale, bur Mrs. Snow will have a new attitude.
 With the sanction of the previously noncommittal Reverend Ford, a charity bazaar to build a new orphanage is held. A late arriving Pollyanna shines, attending despite her aunt's attempts to detain her.
  But the night will end in a catastrophe, and we will see how a town's gift of reciprocity will close this wonderful story on a hopeful note for all.
  Hayley Mills' Oscar for this performance was very well-deserved!",1429315200,,4102,5.0941704035874436

835805,5,6304285396,"Hayley Mills really captured the role of Pollyanna bringing a wild eyed innocent girl with a glass half full attitude that brings a touch of warmth and friendship to a small town that could really use it.  After her parents passed away her Aunt Polly brings her to her home.  After always being poor she is overwhelmed by her Aunt's lavish home and proceeds to pass on her happy attitude to all that she comes into contact with.  Jane Wyman plays Aunt Polly who tends to run the house and town heavyhandedly showing little love to others in her life.  Even that changes thanks to Pollyanna who believes that there is something to be glad about in every situation.  Very good entertainment with life lessons delivered innocently and not sugary.  Well worth a watch, maybe a few watches.",1419897600,,785,4.6521739130434785

Pollyanna is an orphan who is shipped off to live with her indifferent aunt who controls the entire town which is named after her family.  With Pollyanna's overly positive outlook in life, the townsfolks should began to warm up to her and even rebel against the aunt's authoritarian stranglehold on the town.  The ever cute Hayley Mills always remind everyone that in every bad situation, we should look for the good, and be positive, and thankful.  Another Disney classic all kids and adults should watch once, or more, in their lifetime.  In the end when Pollyanna succumbs to feeling sorry for herself, she is reminded by the entire town to look for the good.  We need more Pollyanna's in the world.

836236,5,6304285396,"I don't know how many times i have watched this movie. So much of it is about Christianity and i am not a christian. However I feel the movie goes way beyond such distinctions. Love, sentiment and postive thinking and emotion are so valuable. In all our souls we have daily opportunity to bring light into life and make magic and miracles happen around us. The potential is thrilling.

There are so many negatives presented in this movie. The attitude of the adults toward children in simple conversation borders on abuse. The slavelike class distinctions that permeate thought and dialog are reprehensible, but sadly part of that time. That anyone could think a person was their ""better"" is repugnant. I think society as a whole has come a long way since this thinking prevailed. To the credit of the movie all is presented intact even down to having Polyanna sing solo for most of the flag song when it would have been better if all the children and the audience should have joined in. I worked for Disneyland for awhile and this attitude of special star treatment always bothered me.

But.... the one last brillant moment of healing and love from the town visitation at the end of the movie that spiritually heals not only Polyanna but her Aunt and clearly shows what has happened in her little town will make your heart soar. Only the hardest most pitiful cynic that ever existed could discount that scene. And i don't think that cynic could exist long in this world of hope.

The messages woven throughout the story still stand today as valid and noble.  Given the princess worship of today's young women, the humble and selfless character of Pollyanna as heroine served as a springboard to a wonderful conversation about what it means to be a kind, caring yet strong young woman.  My granddaughters wanted to watch it again and, I believe, it moved them far more than any story about Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Jasmine, Arielle or any of the other princess characters so popular today that seem so self-seeking and in need of a handsome man by their side to make them complete.

I don't care who you are, everyone should own this and get all there love ones in front of the TV and watch. If you think you are a big macho guy and this is just for little children you sir are wrong. You will smile, laugh out loud, and cry. Well maybe you won't cry!

836932,5,6304285396,"One of my favorite movies is the Disney film POLLYANNA, starring Hayley Mills, Jane Wyman, Karl Malden and Richard Egan.  Confess I have not read the original book by Eleanor H. Porter.  The major theme of the movie is ""Look on the Bright Side!""  But a powerful minor theme, which is often overlooked in reviews is: ""No one can own a Church.""

Pollyanna is the young girl of a poor Christian missionary, named after her wealthy aunt Polly.  When her father dies, Pollyanna goes to live with her Aunt Polly, played by Jane Wyman.

Karl Malden plays the town's preacher, who takes his lead from influential aunt Polly Harrington, who seeks to impose her values upon the town.  She is always suggesting texts from the Bible which she thinks the preacher should be including in his sermon, and stressing as important to living a good life.  Karl Malden's sermons are, as a result of aunt Polly's interference, such blasts of hellfire and brimstone and filled with the punishments which evil-doers will encounter in the After Life, that everyone dreads going to Church.

There is a fire at the local orphanage, which creates a sort of town crisis because it exposes how totally inadequate the orphanage is.  Most of the town's citizens and power-people want to tear down the orphanage and build a new one, but aunt Polly insists that because the orphanage is a public monument donated by her family that it should be restored.

A group of people decide to set up a bazar entertainment event to raise money for a new orphanage, but the local newspaper refuses to accept an advertisement for the bazar.  Other business people chime in that they are afraid of Polly Harrington, and that they don't dare go against her wishes.  Someone grumbles that aunt Polly owns or controls one way or another almost everything that goes on in the town.  Pollyanna pipes up, ""She doesn't own the Church.""  ""What?""  ""Nobody can own a Church.""

The townspeople go to the Preacher, hoping he will put his stamp of approval on what they are doing; but Karl Malden refuses to get involved.  In leaving, someone says, ""I guess Pollyanna was wrong.""  ""What do you mean?""  ""She said no one can own a Church.""

My favorite scene is when Preacher Karl Malden is practicing his angry sermon in the countryside, shouting at the trees in the sunny Saturday afternoon, and Pollyanna wanders up to him to listen.  She has a note from aunt Polly for the Preacher.  Karl goes on ranting for a while before he notices that Pollyanna is there.  Pollyanna asks him if he likes being a preacher, and they get to talking about her father, and how her father sometimes couldn't seem to get through to his congregation.  Pollyanna mentions that her father read something once that helped him, and that he had it inscribed on a locket which she wears around her neck.  A quote from Abraham Lincoln.  Something like: ""If you look for the bad in people, expecting to find it, you surely will.""

Pollyanna goes on to explain, that after that, her father started looking for the good in people, and that her father and her started looking for the Happy Texts.  ""The happy texts?""  Pollyanna explains that there are 800 happy texts in the Bible; and that if God took the trouble to tell us to be happy 800 times, he must have wanted us to do it!

After Pollyanna hands Preacher Karl Malden the letter from aunt Polly she has brought for him (she has no idea what is in the letter), she wanders off.  Karl Malden opens the letter and realizes that he has allowed aunt Polly to own his Church.",1378080000,,3539,4.621794871794871

Walt Disney thought this film was the perfect length, I thought it was the perfect length; the director David Swift thought the film too long and wanted an edit.  I'm glad Walt won that argument.  Every time I've watched this film, I've wished it could go on and on.  I'm never ready to give up the company of the characters/actors or their stories.  Every aspect of this film is wonderful.  I love Agnes Moorehead as a ferocious hypochondriac.  Love Adolphe Menjou as an embittered recluse (""No more privacy than a goldfish!"").

837029,5,6304285396,"Hayley Mills in this her first film for Walt Disney not only became a bona fide star, but also won the very last Academy Award bestowed for the best Juvenile Performance of the year. She was in fine company previous winners were Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien. After Ms. Mills win, children were nominated in the regular acting categories and sometimes won such as Patty Duke and Tatum O'Neal.  At any rate, young Ms. Mills absolutely deserved her Oscar, she is the pivot of the whole film, and ""Pollyanna"" ultimately succeeds due to her.

Based on a 1913 bestselling novel by Eleanor Porter ""Pollyanna"" had been both a successful stage play and a silent film starring Mary Pickford in one of her most remembered roles.  In this remake, Walt Disney made some changes all to the good.  Writer/Director David Swift with Disney's collaboration and approval fashioned an excellent script. The story takes place in 1912 in a New England town called ""Harrington"" where Polly Harrington (Jane Wyman) a cool, repressed spinster is the town's wealthiest woman and more or less controls the town.  Her young, orphaned niece Pollyanna Whittier (Hayley Mills) comes to live with her.  Pollyanna's open friendliness and optimistic view of life effects a positive change on all with whom she comes into contact, such as the misanthropic recluse Mr. Pendergast (Adolphe Menjou), the crotchety hypochondriac Mrs. Snow (Agnes Moorehead), and the town's troubled minister Reverend Ford (Karl Malden). Still, Pollyanna's relationship with her Aunt Polly remains unresolved, as Polly keeps Pollyanna at arms length and is complicated by the return of Aunt Polly's old beau Dr. Edmund Chilton (Richard Egan). Polly and he still have strong feelings for each other, but clash over the fate of the town's decrepit orphanage which was built by Polly's father.

Director David Swift had come from television, and Walt Disney chose him personally to direct this, Swift's first feature film.  He does a fine job, and would do even better the next time out with Hayley Mills in the Disney smash hit ""The Parent Trap"".  The production is quite handsome, great care and loving attention is given to recreate an idealized view of America in the halcyon first part of the twentieth century, similar to that of the earlier masterpiece ""Meet Me in Saint Louis"".  The location settings in Santa Rosa, Petaluma and the Napa Valley in addition to the Disney Studio in Burbank, CA were wise choices serene and idyllic.  You believe you're back in 1912 in a small New England town, the color and lighting is warm and bright, and sun dappled since most of the scenes are filmed outdoors.  You feel you can almost breathe in the pure fresh air of an innocent, more simpler time, and temporarily let go of the stresses of the twenty-first century.  The bazaar sequence is a prime example, with it's huge hunks of watermelon being sold for one cent apiece, the slabs of homemade layer cake, the big kettles of corn on the cob, the dunking booth and the sprightly geriatric band with their zippy tunes, check out the peppy lady drummer!  One of Hollywood's most gifted costume designers from it's Golden Era,  Walter Plunkett whose credits included ""Gone With the Wind"" created authentic period clothes that are beautifully done.  The set decoration by Emil Kuri and Fred MacLean is equally splendid down to the littlest detail of the cut glass prisms on the lamps, Polly's sprawling Victorian mansion is especially sumptuous and awe-inspiring.

A very impressive cast of gifted, seasoned actors provided outstanding support to Ms. Mills and made her shine even more.  Nowadays you wouldn't see such an outstanding cast in one film, three Oscar winners, and three Oscar nominees.  Chief among them is Jane Wyman, who has to tread a very fine line in portraying Aunt Polly, she can't be mean to Pollyanna, and although reserved and proper, she can't be an ice maiden.  Ms. Wyman is able to suggest that Polly Harrington has lived alone for so long that although relatively young; she is set in her ways. Very conscious of her position as the town's leading and richest citizen, Polly has an interest or control in most of Harrington's businesses. She believes her way is the right way and over the years has become an autocrat.  This happy go lucky child disrupts her prim routine, and she doesn't know quite how to deal with her, although you feel she probably loves her but has difficulty expressing it.  A very good scene early on that features this ambivalence is when Pollyanna asks on her first night if she may kiss Aunt Polly goodnight.  You can see the conflict on Ms. Wyman's face when Pollyanna flings her arms around her, kisses her, and exclaims, ""I love you, Aunt Polly!""  She doesn't know how to react to this spontaneous display of affection, for a moment she's bewildered before she regains her customary poise.  As Reverend Ford, Karl Malden has a chance to emote strongly almost falling out of his pulpit when he thunders out a fire and brimstone sermon in the manner of the notorious Puritan minister Jonathan Edwards.  In more reflective moments he shows how Reverend Ford is torn between the spiritual and the temporal in the commanding presence of Polly Harrington.  One of classic Hollywood's best character actresses, Agnes Moorehead does wonders with the vinegary pseudo invalid Mrs. Snow who regains her will to live under Pollyanna's influence.  Nancy Olson is fetching as the warm-hearted maid Nancy, who befriends Pollyanna, Hayley Mills and she share a charming little duet.  Disney regular Reta Shaw and especially the sour faced Mary Grace Canfield are just right as the other domestics in Polly's household.  Veteran actors Adolphe Menjou and Donald Crisp register strongly, as does Richard Egan as Polly's love interest, Doctor Edmund Chilton.  Fellow Disney child actor Kevin Corcoran as the scrappy orphan Jimmy Bean is an ideal sidekick for Pollyanna.  Nods of appreciation should be given as well to Anne Seymour, Edward Platt, Leona Dana and James Drury.

The centerpiece of course is Hayley Mills Pollyanna, and she is just superb.  Flaxen haired with deep blue eyes, young Ms. Mills is an ingratiating charmer.  The name ""Pollyanna"" is considered to be a synonym for a ""goody two shoes"", which in Ms. Mills playing she certainly is NOT!  She has spirit, as when she sticks out her tongue at the crabby maid Angelica, (Mary Grace Canfield), stands up to the initially ""scary"" Mr. Pendergast, winds up bossing him about in his own home and tells off the self-pitying Mrs. Snow.  When she first meets Jimmy Bean she is superior and dismissive, and she teases Nancy about her boyfriend George (James Drury). Her Pollyanna is also courageous, when she disobeys Aunt Polly to go to the fund raising bazaar for a new orphanage to fulfill her commitment, and even climbs down the towering tree outside her window to do so. She's really a fairly normal young girl, and she plays Pollyanna in a realistic matter of fact manner, as someone who just has a very optimistic positive attitude.  Ms. Mills is never cloying,sugary sweet or preachy and this saves the film from being overly sentimental and maudlin.

The extras are extra good starting with a very informative and entertaining commentary by star Hayley Mills and writer/director David Swift.  Theirs is a mutual admiration society, which is fine since it seems genuine on both sides, and they would work again even more fortuitously in next year's ""The Parent Trap"". Just to give a quick preview it's revealed Walt Disney would be in tears after viewing the daily rushes of the film, and there is also a very funny story about Pollyanna's locket and the quote engraved upon it. Other highlights are ""Pollyanna: Making of a Masterpiece"" with contributions from Hayley Mills, David Swift, Nancy Olson, and Kevin Corcoran, and ""Re-Creating Pollyanna's America"" which both are very interesting, particularly the latter as to how the background was created, sets, costumes, hairstyles, furnishings etc.  There is included one of Disney's Mickey and Minnie Mouse color cartoons entitled ""Nifty Nineties"" and complements ""Pollyanna"" in it's period time frame, and is rather cute.  One of my favorites is from the Disney Vault, which shows Walt Disney introducing ""Pollyanna"" when it made it television debut on three consecutive Sundays on ""The Wonderful World of Color"" in 1963.  I was nine years old, and I remember seeing this, I loved seeing and hearing the theme song by the Sherman Brothers, and Tinker Bell flying over Cinderella's Castle while fireworks explode.  Watching this show was a staple of my childhood every Sunday evening, and Walt Disney's introductions until his untimely death in 1966 were always welcome.  It was a delight to me to see these again, and hear his comments on the film.  The only sour note is this extremely saccharine song that is sang by this male group of singers about Pollyanna played over a montage of scenes, odd since Walt Disney had made a point of downplaying this quality in the film.

I was a Disney kid, and loved Hayley Mills's Disney films starting with this to her final one in 1965 ""That Darn Cat!""  My favorites were this, ""The Parent Trap"" and ""The Moonspinners"", and when I see them now I have a pleasant sense of nostalgia for my long ago boyhood.  If you are a Disney fan like me, you will probably have an extra fillip of pleasure watching this film.  If you're not, I still recommend you see it, the story, the production, and especially the performances will draw you in to its endearing charms. Walt Disney felt in retrospect that the title should have been changed, because even though the film got raves particularly for Hayley Mills, the film in it's initial run made only a slight profit, and that the title might have scared away the male population. Don't you be worried, this film has stood the test of time, title or no. Be sure you pay attention to the immediate opening shots, you'll be surprised by something you wouldn't expect to start a Disney film, and be sure to listen to David Swift's accompanying anecdote on the commentary, you'll be ""glad"" (to coin a phrase) to you did!",1373414400,4,10226,4.9134224288204535

The director, and therefore the actors, made sure they would get each scene right on the first ""take.""  That gave the actors a ""spontaneity"" edge that most movies lack (because in most movies the chosen take is often from after the actors have performed the scene multiple times).

Is the uplifting spirit of the movie real?  No and yes.  No because it's a fantasy.  But yes because it inspires us to appreciate what we've got instead of being discouraged by what we don't have.  That's a lesson I learned from the movie when I was a kid.

837221,5,6304285396,"As a big-city girl, I generally had little idea of what life was like in a small community or in a rural setting. The story of Pollyanna is more than a ""feel-good"" version of small-town America at the turn of the 20th century. While it does present a romanticized picture of village life, its characters are believable. Jane Wyman as a wealthy spinster and curator of her family's heritage and power, offers viewers a glimpse of a pre-feminist era where women of money could and did use their influence just as ruthlessly as men. Townsfolk eventually become aware that they have enabled ""Polly"" to wield her power and influence by failing to take a stand against her. Even the local paster preaches his sermons according to the dictates of Polly Harrington. His fire and brimstone sermons are not unlike those preached in scores of small churches in villages ""owned"" by this or that mill owner, who likely paid for their construction and whose advice was well heard when it came to the selection of a pastor. The juxtaposition of inherited wealth versus working poor helps viewers to examine the actions of both sides of the economic scale and the decisions that they make. When ""Pollyanna"" comes to live with her Aunt Polly after being orphaned by her missionary parents, the town becomes awakened to a new altruistic paradigm. At first Pollyanna's optimism grates on the nerves of nearly everyone in the village, who had been conditioned for years to accept a joyless vision of life. However, through her persistent happy nature, Pollyanna's often subliminal messages of kindness creep into the sub conscience of everyone she touches. Lastly, the movie Pollyanna is a movie that young and old as well as male or female will be able to view with friends and family, hopefully culminating in an energetic discussion of human behavior.",1360281600,,1834,4.90032154340836

In this game you look for the good, the positive, the beautiful, etc. in situations that at first seem very negative, or undesirable. There is always something good to be seen and gained from our negative life experiences. This version of Pollyanna is older, but really well done.

Don't know if it's because I had a crush on Hayley Mills when we were both young or whether I just liked the idea of an entire town changing its demeanor for the better because of a young girl. The storyline is somewhat predictable but well executed, the acting is superb and is not overdone and Hayley was especially wonderful along with Jane Wyman. Actually I think the entire cast did an outstanding job. If you are thinking of buying this movie you probably already know the plot so I say just buy it. It's one of the few movies that I like enough to watch every year especially during the holidays for that feel good experience.

This set has one of the better disc two renditions. Seeing how they made the movie was more interesting than most I have viewed. I think it is at least worth a peek.

As with most Disney products, the packaging was excellent though it was thicker (double side opening) than needed to be and takes up more shelf space. The clasp locked, single front opening with individual flip disc holder and stationary disc holder inside is a much better design.

The general theme of the criticism focused on a comparison of the book to the film.  As in most cases, the reviewers noted that the book was MUCH better than the film.  As a result, I read the book and I must agree.  The storyline in the novel is much more powerful than the film.  The book is much less melodramatic.  The characters in the book unfold in a more realistic manner.  In the book, Mrs. Snow is a secondary character while Mr. Pendleton is vital to the story.  Jimmy Bean's character is VERY minor in the book.  He is not a tree climber as suggested in the film.  Pollyanna is the tree climber and is too skilled to fall from a tree.

It is a wonderful book to read to a daughter!  However, watching the film with a daughter is also a good experience.  We can talk about comparing the film to the book!!",1307836800,3,1090,4.218446601941747
837504,5,6304285396,"Pollyanna(1960) is a Disney-produced comedy-drama based on the book by Eleanor Porter. David Swift wrote the script and directed the film. This was the first Disney movie that Hayley Mills acted in. Mills plays Pollyanna Whittier, an orphaned girl who moves to Harrington to live with her rich aunt Polly(Jane Wyman). Most of the people in the town are cynical and depressed and Pollyanna cheers them up with her brand of optimism. David Swift takes some liberties with Porter's book. In the book, Pollyanna struggles to speak with Jimmy Bean, not the other way around. Aunt Polly's maid Nancy in the book has unrefined grammar and no boyfriend. Porter wrote a literary sequel titled Pollyanna Grows Up and, so far, it's never been made into a film.
 Walt Disney Home Video did a superb job with this special DVD edition of Pollyanna. They restored the video and audio quality. Yellow boxes that turned pink are yellow again. Hayley Mills' blue eyes are an ""Exorcist green"" in unrestored prints and now they're blue again! The second disc has interviews with David Swift and Hayley Mills. There's footage of Walt Disney himself hosting the TV broadcast of Pollyanna. There's a documentary with a man telling us about Technicolor, Walt Disney branching out into television, and how they restored Pollyanna. This DVD reminds us of going to the movie theater in 1960. We're treated to a Mickey Mouse cartoon before Pollyanna(1960) starts. Pollyanna is a classic gem.",1306886400,5,1463,4.995901639344262

This two-disc DVD is also a great value.  The film looks crisp and beautiful despite its age, and the extras are fantastic.  There are two 30+ minute featurettes, ""Pollyanna - Making of a Masterpiece"" and ""Re-Creating Pollyanna's America,"" that go behind the scenes of filming and include interviews with Roy Disney, the director, Haley Mills, Kevin Corcoran and film historians.

Film based on a book
Disney and Mills ( often seen as super sweet)
Unusual title
Dated material

I heard the insult ""youre are real pollyanna"" frequently growing up and didn't understand it. I found the book and learned.
The cliche ""find something to be glad about"" seems tailor made for wincing. Both the author and Disney filled the book/movie with every child story stereotype, it should not have worked. It does.

837591,5,6304285396,"I love this movie for so many reasons, but the most prominent one is Pollyanna's attitude.

After some thinking, she decided she was glad that she did not need to use the crutches. She embraced the concept of the game fully and touched the lives of everyone she came into contact with. Her optimism was contagious and soon the whole community was transformed.

One line I loved in the movie comes when Rev. Ford read the inscription on Pollyanna's necklace, ""When you look for the bad in mankind, expecting to find it, you surely will"". Though it wasn't an actual quote by Abraham Lincoln as the movie indicated, the words are true nonetheless.

837596,4,6304285396,"The term Pollyanna had already been floating around for decades when, in 1960, Disney released a film adapted from Eleanor H. Porter's classic 1913 novel. At the time critics were predicting doom and gloom for the Disney movie and, in fact, it apparently didn't fare too well in the box office. In 1960 folks had become cynical enough and were leery of checking out a film featuring that endlessly optimistic little glad girl. As it turns out POLLYANNA, starring an excellent Hayley Mills in her Disney debut, is actually a pretty good family flick and a well done slice of Americana circa 1912. But, yes, color it very sentimental.

When her missionary father dies, eleven-year-old Pollyanna Whittier comes to live with her stern wealthy Aunt Polly in the morose little New England town of Harrington. Harrington is named after Pollyanna's grandfather, and as such Aunt Polly feels that she has a certain standard to uphold, certain obligations. Aunt Polly's influence spans deep and wide in the little community. She regularly administers charity on her neighbors, whether they like it or not.

Pollyanna's father had long ago taught her to play the Glad Game, in which she is encouraged to look for the silver lining in every cloud. Pollyanna, newly moved in with her aunt, quickly begins to spread around her brand of sunshine, and her positive disposition soon garners her the ""glad girl"" nickname. In the face of such relentless optimism, the dour and dispirited residents of Harrington can't help but perk up. In short order, Pollyanna softens up both the meanest man and the crabbiest woman in town, plays matchmaker to several couples, and injects enough of a backbone into the cowed community so that it stands up to Aunt Polly's well-mannered tyranny, this last part having to do with a run-down orphanage in dire need of being razed and rebuilt (except that Aunt Polly wants the orphanage to remain as is).

I saw this a long time ago as a kid, and I loved it back then. In watching it again as an adult, I was afraid that I would find it too cloying. But that wasn't so, not for me, anyway. POLLYANNA is as I remembered it, a warm, wholesome, entertaining family movie. And, yes, it does showcase the power of positive thinking. In fact, the central character invests the film with such a sense of rah-rah that it's a mild jolt when we arrive at the church scene in which the reverend Karl Malden goes on to rage and rant in his thunderous ""Death comes unexpectedly!"" sermon. Karl Malden is only one of the several well-known cast supporting Hayley. I thought that Jane Wyman, Agnes Moorehead, Adolphe Menjou, Nancy Olson, and Richard Egan were all very good. But, as always, when she's in a movie, it's really all about Hayley Mills. Others, including director David Swift, have commented before on how Hayley is so very spot on with her acting instincts. Pollyanna Whittier is a precarious part to play, as whosoever takes on the role will always be hard pressed to stay away from schmaltzy territory. But - and factor in, too, that this is only her second film - Hayley is savvy enough and accomplished enough and so darn appealing that she manages to offset the saccharine stuff. And, luckily for Hayley, there are moments in the film when Pollyanna seems to actually get fed up playing the Glad Game. Those moments are breaths of fresh air, and I actually liked Pollyanna better for demonstrating a less saintly side; it makes her more believable. With that said, I - rugged, brawny dude that I am - in recently watching this film, still got that lump caught in the throat when the whole town showed up in Aunt Polly's mansion to wish the gravely injured Pollyanna well. For those wondering if Pollyanna ever did get better, well, I believe Eleanor H. Porter wrote a sequel.

Not too surprising that, during her stay at Disney, Hayley Mills ruled as America's top child actress (never mind that she's British). My favorite Hayley Mills flicks are THE PARENT TRAP (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parent-Trap-1961-and-The-Parent-Trap-II-1986-2-Movie-Collection-2-Disc-Set/dp/B0009X75QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parent Trap (1961) and The Parent Trap II (1986): 2-Movie Collection (2-Disc Set)</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-Darn-Cat/dp/B00005JN0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That Darn Cat!</a>, but POLLYANNA, a well-done film and still quite watchable, ranks right up there.

Pollyanna is the simple story of a high-spirited young orphan girl who unknowingly touches the hearts and lives of everyone she comes in contact with.

Beautifully filmed, lovingly told. This movie weaves its' wonders in a most unassuming and natural way.  All thanks to the superb script and deft direction of David Swift, in this his feature film directorial debut. With impeccable attention to detail, the immense love and great care that have been poured into this project, shows and radiates through in every single frame of film.

Hayley Mills shines in the title role, deservedly winning the Oscar for the Most Outstanding Juvenile Performance of 1960. Her performance is brimming with brilliance and believability. Completely captivating, she is most convincing and constantly charming. Jane Wyman's portrayal of Aunt Polly is every bit as powerful as her Oscar winning performance in ""Johnny Belinda.""

Not forgetting a young Kevin Corcoran, who delivers a delightful performance as the irrepressible, yet irresistible rapscallion, Jimmy Bean, just to name a few.

The period is perfectly portrayed, capturing all the charm, atmosphere, elegance, and nostalgia of turn-of-the-century America. With lovingly lavished sets, stunningly stylish costume designs, the film is gorgeously grand!  All being further complimented and enhanced by Paul Smith's superb musical score, capturing perfectly the personalities and spirit of the movie.

Pollyanna continues to remain my favorite film of all time. As time has passed, this movie has only improved with age, and will continue to do so for generations to come. It is a movie that celebrates life. And more importantly, shows us how to live. In this day and age of hustle and bustle, chaos and confusion, the message that lies at the heart of the film is as timely and important as ever. And one that we all need to be reminded of. A perfect gem of a movie and a pure joy!  Pollyanna will gladden your horizon, lift your spirit, and win your heart.

837681,4,6304285396,"It's always a little intimidating to re-watch favorite movies from your childhood.  You fear being disappointed by what you found captivating as a child.  Oft-times the films seem just a little less ""well made"" or carefully plotted than films devoted to a supposedly more discerning adult audience.  I had fond memories of POLLYANNA, a film my older sister took me to see when I was eight (in fact, I had my first movie star crush on Hayley Milles),  but doubted that I'd find it as engaging as a grown-up.  After all,  the very term ""Pollyanna"" has certain negative associations, synonymous as it is with ""Goody Two-Shoes"" or just old ""goodie goodie.""  Naive optimism may be charming in a (fictional turn of the LAST century child), but does it speak to us jaded, post-modern viewers of the 21st century?

Well, the answer is that it CAN, certainly.  It's all up to you, the viewer.  Pollyanna's sunny disposition, from an adult perspective, is actually an act of sheer willpower.  She's an orphan, after all, sent to live with strangers (her reserved Aunt Polly, whose welcome is tentative at best).  Her ""glad game,"" which was taught to her my her missionary father, is actually a conscious effort to put the best possible spin on otherwise dismaying events.  Positive thinking isn't all that easy in the face of adversity, especially if you're a 10 year old child.

POLLYANNA also addresses, in its own innocent way, some theological or, at least, doctrinal issues.  Her gradual influence on the town's minister leads him to gradually disavow the grim fire-and-brimstone preaching that Pollyanna's influential Aunt Polly, who practically owns the town, seems to prefer in favor of a more optimistic--and dare we say, more New Testament--kind of teaching.  These were points that went over my head as an eight year old.

What didn't go over my head at the time was the plight of nearly all the children in the film, since nearly all of them were presented as orphans.  The secret fear of nearly every small child, of course, is losing his or her parents.  I don't think I realized that by 1960, life expectancy had improved for nearly everyone on the N. American continent.  It probably didn't help that my hometown had a ""children's home,"" and I assumed (probably incorrectly) that the residents there were all children whose parents had died.

That was such a haunting issue to me then me that to this very day, when I read a story about an orphan to a child, I always mention that nowadays things are different and only very few children experience the tragedy of losing both parents.  But the strength of a tale like POLLYANNA is that it shows how even a child can overcome extreme adversity and retain a sense of wonder and optimism.

Hayley Mills received a Special Academy Award for her performance in this film, and she is indeed charming--and quite polished.  Her British accent seems to be explained away by the fact that her father is described as having been a ""missionary in the British West Indies.""  (Of course, most of her subsequent Disney roles had her playing American girls, and her accent was always simply ignored).  Her speech coaches did take pains, apparently, to coach her on the more-or-less standard pronunciation of ""aunt"" as ""ant,"" which might have been the one Britishism in her speech pattern they COULD have overlooked.  After all, if I am not mistaken, the story takes place in Vermont, and in New England (as in Olde England) most speakers would pronounce that word as ""ahnt.""  In fact, the speech coaches probably should have probably coached all the AMERICAN actors on a proper New England accent.

That's a quibble, however, POLLYANNA is a charmer and well worth seeing after 47 years.  And it provides food for thought, for young and old to boot.  What's not to like--or to be glad about?",1198368000,7,3830,4.81039755351682

This is definitely one of those that every young child should see!  With everything from dress-up to songs to chase scenes and frightening old hermits, this film incorporates a lot of popular images for children.

837710,3,6304285396,"Pollyanna Whittier (Hayley Mills) has had a hard life.  Her parents have recently died, so the little girl is sent to live with her aunt Polly (Jane Wyman).

Polly is the only surviving adult heir of the Harrington family.  As such, she is extremely rich.  But she also has the responsibility of running the town, named Harrington after her family.  With so many people depending on her, Polly has developed a pessimistic view on life.  She does things out of duty, not because she wants to do them.

Into this world comes Pollyanna.  She is an optimist.  In fact, her family invented the ""Glad Game.""  When Pollyanna starts to be overwhelmed by bad things, she looks for something to be glad about no matter the circumstances.

While Pollyanna's attitude has no effect on her aunt, it slowly begins to work on the town of Harrington.  But can Pollyanna's attitude change the one person in town who needs it most?

I've been interested to see this movie for years.  It was filmed in my hometown, and I've driven by Aunt Polly's house I don't know how many times.  I finally got a chance to see it, and I'm glad.

The movie is entertaining.  Maybe because I'm an adult, I got drawn into the politics in the town.  I was actually more interested in that then in watching Pollyanna work her charm on the grumps in town.

The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing.  There are several repetitive scenes and scenes that would be cut for today's short attention span audiences.  Maybe if I had seen this as a kid I wouldn't mind, but as an adult, I found myself watching the clock at times to see how much longer the movie would run.

Add to that the climax.  Instead of being properly developed, the movie ends abruptly.  I want to know what happened next.  Still, I had come to care for the characters, so I was emotionally affected by the ending.

This movie is well worth watching once.  However, Disney has released better films over the years.",1162339200,10,1949,4.525862068965517

837767,5,6304285396,"""Pollyanna"" is an underappreciated masterpiece. Everything was done right. It is one of those projects where you cannot fault anything, and the casting is impeccable. Most of all, this story is moving and has a beautiful, inspiring message.

Hayley Mills is given her first starring role, and undoubtedly makes ""Pollyanna"" everything that it is. Unlike other child stars, Mills is totally natural, and gives the impression of spontaneity, honesty and frankness that is refreshingly charming. She plays a little girl who comes to live with her aunt Polly in the town of Harrington after her parents have died, and ends up transforming the whole town into an appreciative, kinder, GLADDER community. Her trick? That magic she has of reminding everybody she meets how much there is of life to be thankful for.

This is not an overly sugary movie, as it might at first seem. It is a touching tribute to life and love, and a nostalgic depiction of the community atmosphere of a small town at the turn of the century. The movie is also a major tear-jerker, so be warned.

What I love most about ""Pollyanna"" is the way it shows a cross-section of people from the town of Harrington and the way their lives are brightened by the presence of a child.

The director wrote the screenplay and had his way in everything and it shows.  Amazingly, the only interference from Walt was when he refused to allow any editing.  He loved the first cut so much that he couldn't stand to see any of it end up in the trash.  When was the last time you heard of a director's cut that would have been shorter than the studio cut?  Well, Walt was right.  We love every second of it and are only sad that it is not longer.  Oh that Disney would ditch CGI and computer animation and get back to making movies like this.  It is not impossible.  The BBC still manages it occassionally.  If our children were brought up on movies like this, they would be smarter, kinder, and quieter.

837773,5,6304285396,"This is Disney live action done right and with the right ingridents this movie after you watch it will stay close to your heart.

Based on the classic story- Pollyanna comes to Harrington after her missionary parents have died... living with her aunt who has a ton of money and total control of the town. Pollyanna in a short amount of time manages to change the way those around her feel with her overlly cheerful nature-- from cinvincing a sick woman to get out of bed, to be-friending an orphan/finding him a home, helping her aunt Polly connect with her old flame, or helping a preacher join the community- before the town nows it they are just as cheerful as Pollyanna and boy are they glad she came into their lives. Even her aunt Polly who is usually stiff and un-emotional is changed by the cheerful girl. When Pollyanna falls while climbing a tree leaving her paralyzed the town now realizes it is their turn to help the little girl be glad about something... ending with a beautiful scene where everyone in the town comes to the house bringing presents, flowers, and animals to show Pollyanna how much she means to them.

This movie is perfect and teaches the lesson that if we look for the good in others and remain positive we can change people's lives. I love this movie and it is a simple treasure and an ultimate movie for family movie night... After watching this you'll find yourself thinking about how you have lived your life and how much a positive attitude can have an impact on a person. With knock-performances from the whole cast including a young Hayley Mills who won a special Academy award for her performance as the overly- happy youngster.

837774,5,6304285396,"""Pollyanna"" was the first and, in my opinion, the best of the first six movies that Hayley Mills starred in for Disney, the others being ""The Parent Trap"" in 1961, ""In Search of the Castaways"" in 1962, ""Summer Magic"" in 1963, ""The Moon-Spinners"" in 1964, and ""That Darn Cat"" in 1965.  While all six of the movies are enjoyable family fare, this movie has a depth and complexity approached only in ""Summer Magic.""

In the first thirty minutes a wide-eyed Pollyanna is witness to the power her Aunt Polly wields in her town, named Harrington after her family.  Pollyanna also quickly begins to learn that there are numerous stories in her town, which she learns throughout the movie piece by piece, ultimately giving her a power different from her aunt's.

This movie takes place in the early part of the twentieth century.  Aunt Polly's genteel and Victorian behavior, even if a little stereotypical, has a feel to it that we often attribute to that era.  At one point Aunt Polly all but uses the term ""noblesse oblige,"" which is how wealthy people often considered their obligation to society.  The clothing and sets all appear to be realistic, enhancing the period believability.  The quality of the costumes and the sets is but one of the remarkable features of this movie.

The background stories provide a field of torment and pain to enhance Pollyanna's consistently ""glad"" outlook on the world.  It is Pollyanna's attitude toward life that slowly changes the lives of everyone in Harrington, one person at a time.  Even better, Pollyanna teaches those she meets that it is okay to feel good, and to make others feel good.  Even more importantly, she teaches people to feel from the heart, which in many cases leads to love.  Hayley Mills was so skilled in this role that she was awarded a special Academy Award for most outstanding juvenile performance of 1960, the last such award given.

The supporting cast for this movie can truly be said to be all-star.  Jane Wyman, who was nearing the end of a career spanning fifty years, is Pollyanna's initially grim Aunt Polly, who eventually learns that she should do things because she cares, not because of the obligation of the rich.  Agnes Moorehead, a veteran of more than 70 movies and a recurring character on the popular 60s television show ""Bewitched,"" is Mrs. Snow, a grumpy hypochondriac who has one foot in her casket, though there is actually nothing wrong with her.

Karl Malden is fire and brimstone Reverend Paul Ford who manages to keep many of the faithful wide-eyed on Sunday; he is also under Aunt Polly's control.  Malden had just finished ""The Hanging Tree"" with Gary Cooper, and there is irony in that the character in this movie is almost completely opposite that of the role he had just played.  Veteran Disney child star Kevin Corcoran plays mischievous orphan Jimmy Bean, who helps Mr. Pendegast, the town hermit, break out of his self-imposed shell.  Adolphe Menjou played Mr. Pendegast in the last movie role of his 150 movie career.  James Drury of television's ""The Virginian"" plays George Dodd, who is the love interest of Nancy Furman, Aunt Polly's maid, and Aunt Polly does not approve of the relationship.  Nancy Olson was also in a number of other Disney movies, including ""The Absent Minded Professor"" and ""Son of Flubber,"" with an uncredited cameo in 1997's ""Flubber.""

This movie benefits from an excellent transfer to DVD and a move to a widescreen format.  I recommend purchasing this movie in this format if you currently have the movie only on VHS or have yet to purchase it.  There are additional extras that viewers with interest in the era and how the movie was made may find enjoyable.

The movie drives its point home at the end, when Pollyanna is depressed following an accident and needs support herself.  The support she receives from the townspeople is a testament to the power of Pollyanna's selfless love, which touches the hearts not only of the fictional town, but those of viewers.

This heartwarming movie is more than an excellent family film, more than an excellent Hayley Mills film and more than an excellent period movie; it is a great Disney movie at an artistic peak of the Walt Disney Company.",1110672000,73,4210,4.809722222222222

My sisters also got hooked on it. My mom still cries at certain parts.  Haley Mills is superb.  I cannot imagine any other actress playing the part. Pollyanna is an orphan who comes to live with her snooty, rich, very bitter aunt Polly, whom she was named after.  Polly as well as her staff treat Pollyanna with contempt at first.  Her sunny disposition and fearlessness slowly transforms them as well as the whole town.  She befriends an orphan in town who is hoping to get adopted someday himself as well as a grumpy old recluse whom most people avoid at all costs.  My favorite scene is when the town hosts a bazzar to raise money for a new orphanage.  The extra dvd that comes with the movie is terrific, too.

Having watched M.T's rendition, I then wanted to see that old disney classic I remember loving so much.  HAving just watched the disney version, I can't make up my mind which I love more, the PBS version or Disney's.  They each have their good points.  Haylee Mills is MUCH more adorable.  I mean, come on, who doesn't adore Haylee Mills.  I was rolling during the fire and brimstone speech by the reverand!  My goodness, it was a wonder anyone showed up for church with sermons like that!

  There were a few differences between the movies.  PBS's version had Pollyanna get hit by an automobile which then consequently  causes Nancy to call off her engagement to the George, while Disney has Pollyanna fall off of the roof, which was much more edge of your seat.  It almost happens in slow motion.  The PBS version you don't know right away who the old love interest of Polly was.  It's a bit of a mystery.  I'm assuming that the PBS version goes more by the book, but I'm not sure just yet.  I have  yet to read it.  Also the two endings were different.  Disney's Pollyanna she is still paralyzed at the end, while PBS's she's walks down the isle to be the flower girl for Aunt Polly's wedding to Dr. Ch---  (I can't remember his name.)

  Either way Both versions were wonderful...With the exception of Disney showing the random 12 year old boys bottom in the very first scene.  What was that about?

837810,5,6304285396,"I was 9 years old the first time I saw Pollyanna on the Wonderful World of Disney back in the early 1970's. I had read the book and was thrilled to see it on the screen. Haley Mill's performance is outstanding and is worthy of the special Academy Award she received. Jane Wyman, Agnes Moorehead and Adolph Menjou also give first rate performances as Aunt Polly, Mrs. Snow and Mr. Pendergast. Throughout the circumstances of life Pollyanna has a choice: she can either give into the circumstances which surround her while adopting the attitude of defeat or rise above the circumstances and ""be glad"". This is a movie which will inspire you!",1079222400,4,639,4.714285714285714
837811,1,6304285396,"I was horrified when I saw this movie version of the book.  They changed everything about the characters except their names. Yes, Pollyanna is glad, but it fails to capture the essence of her struggle to be glad when she is faced with so much adversity.  Miss Polly is not ruthless and conniving and does not influence the town as depicted in the movie.  She is struggling herself, which is where Pollyanna comes into the picture.  My children were flabbergasted at seeing this film.  They knew the characters and these were *not* them.  The plot is so skewed that you will miss it if you see this film.  Do yourselves a favor and get the BBC version, or better yet, read the book.  It is truly a delightful story that you will cherish.",1075161600,18,736,4.481203007518797

One And Only Genuine Origional Family Band
Follow Me Boys!
BON VOYAGE!
Pollyanna
And I love all of them but my ultimate top favorite was Pollyanna I got the same edition as pictured above the Old white clamshell release with A Little Mickey Mouse at the Top. Well My Favorite Seen was when Pollyanna (Haley Mills) and Jimmy Bean (Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran) went to Mr. Pendergast and Jimmy was trying to climb the tree. My Favorite Actoress in this classic Disney film though was Jane Wyman as Aunt Polly. I also liked Richard Egan as Dr. Chilton. But one of the best roles other than Aunt Polly, and Pollyanna was played by Nancy Olson (SMITH!, Absent Minded Professor, Snowball Express)  as Nancy. I still remember sitting by the television set. With the Video case in my hand watching in awe. At this classic Disney Film. This movie has never gone out of circulation with Disney. It is one of the few that hasn't. Those films are what started me collecting Disney. I still have those 4. And I have alot more of the old white clamshell releases of The Old Disney Films. Well Disney did a great thing when they put this classic film on Disney. I know that there has been a debate that They shouldn't have had Haley Mills sing America The Beautiful. But why don't people grow up. She did a great job and she put feeling into it. She wasn't one of those stuped singers that sings it without meaning. She sang it with meaning. This Is A Movie To Remember. If the had a 10 star rating on here. I would give it 10 stars. Other Tha Follow Me Boys! This Is the best Disney Film ever created.",1059004800,6,1666,4.423452768729642
837813,5,6304285396,"What a wonderful movie with a great collection of extras.  Too bad Disney can't do this with all of their live action releases.  The transfer is wonderful and the extras add so much to what is already a fantastic movie.  Great job Disney!  Now, let's do it with the rest of your releases!",1054166400,6,288,4.377358490566038
837814,4,6304285396,"I was a bit nervous seeing this movie as I was scared it was going to live up to it's title and be way too sugary sweet.  I was pleasnatly surprised and even moved afterwards.
Pollyanna is a delightful movie that lifts the spirits and provides many life lessons without ever being preachy or feeling like a school lesson.  I was genuinely entertained and even a bit surprised at the bold steps the movie takes.  Would you think this movie features a preacher most everyone fears, or has a bittersweet ending?  I thought not.  Well there's plenty more here to surprise you.  Just give it a chance.
About the only thing I fault the movie for is being a bit too long.  Some scenes just seem to go on and on, but that's what chapter stops and the fast forward button are for.
As for the DVD presentation, it's terrific.  The movie looks and sounds stunning plus the second disc is just jammed packed with extra material.  I was excited to listen to the commentary, but sadly it's as sugary and full of fake emotion as the movie is not.  Still the other bonuses are well worth the extra bucks and there will probably never be a better presentation of Pollyanna.",1046995200,50,1156,4.436018957345971
837825,3,6304285396,"I suppose I am being just a tad unfair with my title for this review.  ""Pollyana"" was a film that looked so God awful back when it was first released on VHS in the early eighties that I really didn't hold out much hope for it on DVD. The story, by Eleanor S. Porter, is, of course, about a poor orphan who comes to live with her up tight aunt in a stiff community of social climbers.  But through her sheer will and pleasantness, Pollyana overcomes even the most hardened cynic in the town.  It's a wonderful story and a great cast.  But the transfer continues to look dated.  Colors are often weak or pasty.  There are quite a few scenes that appear soft or slightly out of focus.  Pixelization and edge enhancement intrude in the background information, making the overall visual experience pretty run of the mill.  The audio is dated but well represented.  As with other discs in the ""Vault Disney"" series, ""Pollyana"" is given a royal treatment with enough extra features for two movies.  Once again, more should have been done with the print before rushing it out on DVD.  I concede that a lot has been done already.  But this disc needs much more.",1046736000,12,1152,4.485576923076923
837826,5,6304285396,"This movie is so good! I thought no movie could be better than those of Shirley Temple, and I was always hoping a film similar to Heidi would be released. Luckily I found ""Pollyanna"" on DVD. Wow! I sort of pushed my Shirley Temple gift set near the back and brought forth my new Vault Disney DVD collection. Pollyanna is very similar to Heidi and I recommend it to fans of that movie. This movie is about a little orphan girl-Pollyanna-who is sent to live with her strict aunt. Everyone in the town is always grumpy, but Pollyanna teaches them her ""glad game"" and makes everyone lovable and cheerful. Only at the end of the movie when a terrible tragedy takes place, does everyone realise how much they appreciate Pollyanna. A wonderful family film that isn't only for children, but for adults too. The DVD comes with lots of documentaries, interviews, pictures, and some music too! Even a commentary! Trust me, fans of Shirley Temple may also appreciate Hayley Mills too!",1028332800,10,972,4.690058479532164
837827,5,6304285396,"I love the film ""Pollyanna"" and have been waiting for the DVD for what seems like forever.  I am very impressed by it!  The picture and sound quality are amazing - so much better than the copy I have taped off TV from the late 80s.  The film is presented in widescreen but I've realized not a lot goes on on the sides of the picture in this particular movie; in other words, you really don't get much more action with widescreen than you would have with the pan & scan video or a TV-taped version.  However, this IS the film as the director intended it, and I think that's great.  This DVD (actually two DVDs!) contains so much great stuff, I can't even list it all here.  Let's just say amazon.com's list doesn't even get INTO what's on this DVD.  There are so many little treasures, and something for everyone - Disney fanatics, Hayley Mills fans, movie freaks, and (naturally!) Pollyanna fans.  My favorite features so far are the featurette on Pollyanna advertising, the one about how they restored the picture/film to make the colors how they should have been, and the one about Pollyanna merchandise.  Plus, the audio commentary by Hayley Mills and the (now late) David Swift is insightful and interesting.  I would also recommend the ""Parent Trap"" DVD for more of the same fun.  The Disney co. really went all out for these DVDs and they are well worth the money.  And if you've never seen the movie - it's an adorable family flick that I've loved for nearly 14 years.  I hope you like it, too!",1023148800,121,1501,4.4944649446494465

837830,5,6304285396,"Many Amazon dvd reviews concentrate on the film, and not the dvd presentation . . . this isn't one of them . . . But I must say that if you haven't already seen the film, it ISN'T the sappy gag-inducer you probably think it is.  David Swift did a great job at adapting the film and achieving a balance between sentiment, drama, and fun.  Now, on to the dvd . . .
I'm no technical genius, but the movie looks and sounds fabulous.  The print is clean and bright, with no visible flaws.  The color range seems accurate and the film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio.  One little touch I especially appreciated was the option to watch the cartoon originally accompanying the film (""Nifty Nineties"" starring Mickey Mouse) right before our ""feature presentation,"" just as 1960's movie-goers would have.
As if the picture quality wasn't enough to make this a disc worth purchasing, the extras will convince you.  The features are interesting without being excessively repetitive.  On the main disc we get a really nice audio commentary with Haley Mills and David Swift, the writer/director/producer.
Disc 2 has the rest of the features.  The menu has several layers, but is well-laid out and easy to use.  It's also surprisingly attractive, giving you the feeling of actually looking at materials in the ""Disney Archives.""
There are two good documentaries, ""Pollyanna: Making of a Masterpiece,"" which provides interviews with Swift, Mills, Nancy Olson, Kevin Corcoran, etc. and good background info on the adaption of the book, art-direction, filming, and more.  The involvement of David Swift in these materials really makes these disc 2 items particularly enlightening.
There are quite a few different image galleries, the original promos and trailers, and Walt Disney's intros from when Pollyanna was broadcast on tv.  A short in which Nancy Olson describes the job of the actor, a little film with archival fottage of ""1912,"" and a little yearbook that goes through all of the projects Disney was working on in 1960, for movies, tv, animation, etc.
All of these items are good, but a few of features really stood out for me, and they are only hinted at on the official list of features.
1.  Restoration of the Pollyanna Film Print:
Longer-than-expected explanation of how Disney Studios  resurrected the Pollyanna negative from color fade and deterioration.  As an archivist myself, I always look forward to these kinds of features, but find them superficial and disappointing.  This time I was very pleased.  It even takes the time to explain what a three-color-separation archival negative is!  Hurrah!!
2.  Pollyanna Merchandising:
We get a gallery and a little featurette, where the items are displayed and explained.  I was especially surprised about the Pollyanna music . . . which leads me to . . .
3.  The Sound Gallery:
This was an incredible surprise!!  I didn't see any mention of it on the disc specs.  You get to hear the original radio ad, and Haley Mills herself sing the songs ""Pollyanna"" and ""Jimmy Bean,"" that appeared on the 1960 Pollyanna albums.  Neat-o!  But the last item in the Jukebox totally blew me away.  The ENTIRE 1960 Pollyanna story album!!  Movie studio really haven't produced these things since the 80s, but there used to be a time when you could take out your record player and recreate the movie experience at home; the only way to do so before home video.  The Pollyanna album is nice since it even features dialogue from the film, rather than a redramatization with a different cast.
I was immensely pleased with the ""Vault Disney"" production of Pollyanna . . . let's hope Vault Disney continues.  It's too bad that not all studios show such care and respect for their ""children's"" releases.  A good ""children's"" film appeals to everybody!",1020988800,18,3794,4.912087912087912
837831,5,6304285396,"DVD #2 alone is worth the price of admission not to mention the movie in DVD #1. If you are a Disney movie fan, you will enjoy the collection both for the story and what it took to restore the film. The 1960's had a real problem with color negative film going bad over time but with the method described in the DVD, they saved (restored) a superb movie and prevented it from being destroyed due to age. It is a must see for anyone young or old and if you saw it in a movie theater as I did as a youngster when it was first released, it will bring back some great memories.",1020902400,4,572,3.982608695652174
837892,5,6304285396,"Pollyanna is a innocent spirit in a strict world ruled by adults who somehow lost the connection with their inner child early in life. She enjoys the moment and this irritates people until they learn that the way she sees life really does bring happiness to their own existence on the planet.

Adopted by her Aunt, she learns to live a new life after loosing her missionary parents in the British West Indies. Her father seems to have taught her how to deal with life and she often quotes something wonderful he has said. Of course, the grownups in the story don't understand her at all and tell her not to repeat the wisdom of her father. That in fact showed how out of touch they are with a child's delicate feelings.

Unshaken, Pollyanna is happy just to have her own room and still desires to see life in a positive way. She also gives everyone more than one chance to see the beauty in life. She becomes a ray of sunshine and a breath of fresh air in a stuffy town filled with grumpy lives. Yet, even Pollyanna gives up for a few minutes, then realizes what a responsibility she has to bring happiness to the lives of those she has learned to love.

Almost single handedly, she rallies the entire town to a good cause and helps to raise money for a new orphanage. Like a little angel, she touches each life she meets with a sweet innocence and creative flair.

Just as Pollyanna has changed so many lives for the better, her life takes a drastic turn for the worse. Even in the face of tragedy, what she does achieve is actually quite miraculous. The ending is spectacular and shows how love can really change the world you live in. You will not cry for the sadness of the situation, but more for the overwhelming realization of what one life can achieve.

Perfect for all ages and a much needed ray of light in our pessimistic world! After viewing this movie, you might start to see more good in life and in others. It is there if you find the time to look.

You will smile, laugh and cry.
Absolutely Charming!

837893,4,6304285396,"That's what crusty Adolphe Menjou snaps at Hayley Mills (Pollyanna), but even he is won over eventually by the indomitable orphan girl determined to bring the Glad Game to her new hometown. This town, like so many places really, is filled with unhappy people who have lost the ability to see that the life they've been given is full of blessings, that they have more to be glad of than they realize. Adolphe Menjou believes that everyone hates and fears him, Agnes Moorehead is a hypochondriac ruining her daughter's life, Karl Malden is a minister who can't preach anything but damnation, and Jane Wyman has stopped listening to her heart and only thinks of social status. These and others in the town are affected by Pollyanna's message of hope. Yet the biggest test of the Glad Game will be for Pollyanna herself, when she faces personal tragedy.
This is one of Disney's Americana classics, the sort that Main Street USA in Disneyworld is based on. It's a funny, cheerful movie that is filled with workman like performances by many solid Hollywood performers, most of whom are bound to be familiar to any viewer who's owned a TV during the last couple of decades. Hayley Mills does give an exceptional performance for a girl of only 14, chock full of insight and charisma.

This wonderful widescreen DVD features an audio commentary by Hayley Mills and director/screenwriter David Swift.  This film was a labor of love for all involved.  It shows in the final product.
The script is wonderful because it does not make Pollyanna to sweet to be believable.  Hayley's natural abilities make the film a treasure. Be sure to listen to the commentary and have a few laughs as Hayley talks about her talk with her Dad Sir John Mills.  Especially humorous was her decision the day before shooting her first scene to give herself a little haircut.

People today would probably say it is sacchrine-sweet and cheesy. I disagree. This is a movie you can laugh and cry while watching. The cast is absolutely superb, especially Hayley Mills.

837896,5,6304285396,"If you thought Shirley Temple was an great child star, wait 'til you see Hayley Mills' performance in one of the most wonderful movies I've ever watched : Pollyanna. Hayley makes her first appearance in a Disney movie in this lovely story about a little orphan girl sent to live in Harrington with her aunt Polly, who controls the town founded by her family. In living there Pollyanna preaches the gladness of the heart and bring it into those of most cross townspeople. Everyone is pefect in their performance, especially Miss Mills' who even won an Oscar for hers. Disney really has the formula when it comes to family films and this one proves it while sending out a very positive message. Hayley Mills is one of my very favorite actresses and this movie is a tear-jerker even for someone (me) who only once cried in 2 movies including this one. It is purely WONDERFUL.
This movie is part of a The Walt Disney Classics' Hayley Mills Collection with The Parent Trap, That Darn Cat!, Summer Magic & The Moon-Spinners which are all as fubulous as this one. This collection should be completed, though, because the other Disney movie she did : ""In Search Of The Castaways"" with Maurice Chevalier, is missing.
