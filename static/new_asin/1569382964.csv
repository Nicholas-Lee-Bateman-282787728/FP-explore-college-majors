I was excited that the story center around another character from the Shigens, Ayako. She tells about her past and how she loved someone who died, but then the man Takaya and Ayako are trying to capture looks like the one she loved from long ago.

Also what excite me was how Naoe was different from the series and so was Takaya. Naoe left Takaya in the end of the series telling him how he feels about him and leaves. He still apart from the Shigen's in the OVA doing his own being a body gard, but then bumps into Takaya during an infestigation. When Naoe meets up with Takaya he goes back as being the same in the series but 10 times worse. He tells Takaya how feels about him again but it leads to rage, witch leads to a rape scene making Takaya flash back about his past life (giving us a clue why he sealed his memories).

I was glad they made an OVA to tell more of the show, but what I didn't like was how Yuzuru and Chiaka only had a small part. I would like to know more of Yuzuru and whats the conection with him and Takaya, and why he has powers which scares the fudal under-world.

I still rate it a five for giving me a little more of the story.",1143849600,8,1283,4.039370078740157
187381,5,1569382964,"In this OAV, Tagetora/Takaya is not the same slacker from volumes 1-4.  He has finally come to terms with who he and what he is.  Naoe returns and we see a jealous and manipulative Tagetora and finally start to understand what Naoe means when he claims (in the volumes 1-4) that Tagetora is the reason why he acts the way he does.  Be warned, though.  There is a rape scene between the two where Tagetora/Takaya has another flashback to something disturbing that happened to him.

There is a lot about ""sis's"" past in this one that ties in with the present.  A present-day pocessor looks very like her lover from two hundred years ago, but this new pocessor has a secret.",1129248000,11,671,4.5041322314049586
187382,5,1569382964,"The Mirage of Blaze OVA is more intense, better animated and has better storytelling than the TV Series.

I do have to say that the storytelling in the OVA does a lot more than the TV series to lessen the confusion of us English viewers who are without the original novels or manga to work from.  However, if you haven't seen the TV series you may be a bit confused anyway about what is going on.  They don't go into very much detail about the backstory of the characters, what happened between them 400 years ago, or even really what happened in the TV series (particularly between Naoe and Takaya).  The only thing they really include from the TV series is the final words between Takaya and Naoe at the very end of episode 13.

The focus of the OVA is threefold:

First, there is the new Feudal Underworld threat, centering around this man, Araki, who bears a striking resemblace to Ayako's lover from 200 years previously.  He is under attack from one of the warring clans, who wish to use him as a sacrifice in order to obtain a powerful weapon from a sacred relic.  Episode one centers around setting up this story (whereas episode two is Naoe/Takaya heavy, and episode three Ayako dominant).

Second, Ayako.  Ayako features dominantly in the OVA.  In fact, she practically takes over the third episode with her backstory about this former lover of hers.  The most human and sympathetic moments in the OVA center around her.  While Takaya and Naoe are off being crazy and mean to each other and everyone around them, Ayako is not only the voice of reason, but of humanity.  You're really going to like her in this one.

And third, the continuing battle between Naoe and Takaya for dominance, respect and love.  Takaya is particularly cruel to Naoe in this series, and Naoe for his part, is even more crazy than he was in the TV series.  It is almost mindblowing how hard they are both fighting for dominance.  Takaya's last words to Naoe at the end of episode 3 about what Naoe has to do to ""have"" him are striking, and leave the door open to not only another series, but also limitless potential among fan circles for inspired fiction.

This DVD is definitely NOT recommended for anyone under at least the age of 16, even though the DVD is rated 13+.  Consider that uncomfortable scene between Takaya and Naoe in episode 7 of the TV series and magnify it by ten in the second episode of the OVA.  ""Unflinching,"" ""intense"" or even ""tactless"" are good words to use to describe what happens.  If the homosexual overtones (or for that matter, rape) of the series made you uncomfortable, I suggest passing on the OVA.  However, pay close attention to the flashback (if you can avoid averting your eyes, it's pretty intense in itself) that Takaya has during this scene.  It reveals at least part of the reason for his reluctance to accept Naoe's affections.  It is truely insightful for us viewers to work with who only had sketchy details about what happened between the two 400 years ago when they were on opposing sides, and even less about them individually.  The whole thing about what Naoe did to Takaya and this woman that he loved (or something) at the time is sidestepped in the OVA, perhaps unfortunately, since I at least needed some clarification.

As for all the other characters from the TV series there is no mention of Takeda, Ranmaru, the Fuuma ninjas or any of our other favorite badguys.  Furthermore, Yuzuru and Chiaka have very small cameos at the beggining of the first episode, and then we practically don't see them at all afterwards.  So, any Yuzuru and Chiaki fans may be disappointed.

The DVD includes textless opening, closing, and three separate interviews with the Japanese voice actors who played Takaya, Naoe and Ayako that were presumably originally released with each episode of the OVA in Japan.  The DVD also comes with a bonus animeworks catalogue with some sneak peeks at episode 1 of Samurai Deeper Kyo and Twelve Kingdoms.

We can only hope for more localized Mirage of Blaze in the future.  Whether that be more series, or yaoi manga translations or even dare we hope, the original novels...",1126483200,71,4134,4.6579310344827585

You will FINALLY get to see why Kagetora fights so strongly against his love and desire for Naoe and the reason why Naoe too, hates and loves Kagetora!!!  I had to rewind and rewind so I could put it all together and when I finally was done, I was like ""whew!""

7797013,3,1569382964,"OK -- the title seems a little harsh but it isn't meant to be. This was a well done DVD -- the technical things all wonderfull and really good graphics.
 Thge story on the other hand seemed a little vague to me. If you were to purchase this specifically for gay content you'll, probably, be disappointed. I like Yoai because it handles the topic of boys loveing boys directly and without apology -- NOT this time though.
There was a rape scene, and these things happen, and it was presented for what rape is really all about -- power vs. sex etc... But it was overall grudgingly respectfull of the gay, or homoerotic,  tones throughout.
The way this ends, by the way, leaves you wanting more -- like an actual, logical, end to the story. I'm more than happy to move on to other charactors and other stories.",1229212800,2,807,4.445945945945946
7797014,5,1569382964,"I LOVED it!  Not only was the animation good but the story was great.  Naoe is my favorite character.  I'm a sucker for a torchered soul and he has a sexy voice.  I love his relationship with Takaya. I wasn't into Yaoi until I saw this.  They have a beautiful and complex love story.  Almost like a parent/child relationship but they have a tendency to switch roles, sometimes Takaya is dominant and sometimes Naoe is. I love that no matter what their issues are the story shows they are stronger together then apart.  The intense almost sex scene explains a lot about why Naoe feels torchered and Takaya's reluctance.

I'm hoping for another installment the ending left a lot of opportunities.  A definite must see.",1155427200,3,716,4.664
7797015,5,1569382964,"To begin with, if you are looking for Mechas, CB or stuff like that etc. than you you should avoid this anime.

Also, if someone of you does not like a series that includes, in the broader sense of meaning, man to man `attractions' than you better should skip this one as well.

Moreover, this is the continuation of the first Mirage of Blaze.

Quick story overview of what is going on in general (mostly in the first volumes of Mirage of Blaze):

The two main characters (protagonists) are Kagetora and Naoe. In order to understand the story, you should keep in mind that although the main story resolves in our times you will get information and `flashbacks' of earlier times as well. The reason is that:
a) Re-incarnation of souls
b) The two main protagonists used to live in feudal time-periods when war was going on and they are re-incarnated today with `new' names: Takkaya is Kagetora and Yuzuru is Naoe.
c) The war that used to be at earlier times continues still today (by psychic powers etc.).
d) War occurs in both our world and the spiritual world.
e) Power games between Clans etc.

The problem: The warriors do remember their past lives etc. but Kagetora does not (in order to fully awaken his powers he needs to remember). This will lead to an explosive mixture of `switching' emotions; for instance, you will see that Naoe loves and hates Kagetora as well (may sound confusing but when watching it you will understand.

As for the story of the current OVA:

It starts where the first one left off. The two main protagonists' relation and emotions have reached, at least in my humble opinion, the sphere of being called mind-blowing and `madness'. Who will dominate over the other one and under what conditions?

Additionally, the introduction of new characters continues such as Araki etc. In general, without giving too much away, in these OVAs we see why some clans try to catch Araki (and sacrifice him), continues battles between Naoe and Takaya and last but not least, it also centres on Ayako and her story.
For the ones who are not familiar with this show, at first the story may sound boring but it is completely the opposite. Thing is that I would like to avoid in getting too much into the story because if a reviewer decides to watch the anime than most probably I would ruin the suspense of it (sorry guys).

Furthermore, in these OVAs you will see part of the reason of why the two main protagonists fight constantly and why they feel for each other this way (here I am referring to rape scenes etc.). Believe me; it is very powerful and emotional done! Therefore, if you are not the type who can watch something like this than skip it...
Additionally, the anime keeps a serious and sad tone through out the story and the way it ends it leaves the impression that there will be a continuation (hopefully more will come out soon of Mirage of Blaze). Personally, I dare to say that the series are focusing more to a more mature audience. For instance, you will not see any funny tones, jokes etc. in these series; series that are very serious.

As for the animation: The animation is very good and even better done than the first series; in one word, one of the best I have seen and only a few animes can compare with it.

The dub is very good as is the music that accompanies the series as well (starts, like the first series, with a rock/pop song and finishes with a melodic sad song).

The genre of this anime would be: fantasy/action/romance/ and love drama.

It has a solid storyline, twists, is powerful (and emotional) and very character driven.

Extras: Well, here they also included more extras - than the first show - such as, textless opening/ending, interviews with the actors of the main characters, and an anime catalogue.

Finally, the way the show ends leaves the impression that more is to come and creates a good fan service basis.

Additional:

The story is based on supernatural facts, believes etc. Meaning that the explanations they provide belong to the category of supernatural (something like Anthroposophy or Theosophy 'teachings' and in addition with implication of Christianity, Buddhism, exorcism and all of it combined with magic). Furthermore, the fights that take place belong to the supernatural plane as well but affect tremendously our material world. For instance, if someone sends out to kill an opponent with a psychic fireball (I apologise for the `weird' terminology that I just used) than it will hit our world like an explosion etc.

As to the potential question of buying it or not, my humble opinion would be yes.

To begin with, the price is the (almost) standard one that is used for DVDs of this genre. If you have bought the first one, than you will definitely buy this one as well. If you haven't than buy the first one first and then buy this one. Last but not least, if you are the type that does not like this kind of anime (meaning, man to man `attractions', whereas the term `attraction' is used in the broader sense of meaning) than you should skip this one.
In addition, I believe that the viewer of the show should be at least 15 years and over for the previous mentioned reasons. Apart from it, if you have not yet included a different show in your anime collection than this superb show is worth owning.

At any rate, I hope I could help you ^_^",1153353600,12,5331,4.597471022128556
