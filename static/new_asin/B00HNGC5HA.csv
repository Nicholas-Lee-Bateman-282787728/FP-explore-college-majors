8633778,5,B00HNGC5HA,"The Pound Puppies live for finding the perfect human for every dog.  In the episode Hello Kitten, they make an exception and assist a young cat with finding their new home.  The dog pound has a secret underground base that has a computer network for matching dogs with their forever homes.  Some dogs are tougher to match up than others.  A puppy that is scared of humans warms up to them after accidently going to camp with hyper girls scouts in the episode No More SMores.  In the episode Beauty is Only Fur Deep talks about not judging a book by its cover when one of the dogs goes bald and gets over confident when given fake hair.  Ironically, the dog pound manager is dealing with the same issues when it comes to his toupee.  Human kindness is the theme in the episode Working K9-5.  In that episode a young paper girl is late in delivering papers, but is not given a chance to explain why until the end.",1396915200,,911,4.349112426035503
8633779,5,B00HNGC5HA,"This new version of Pound Puppies (from The Hub Network and Hasbro Studios) is a great show and it is extremely underrated. The show has sharp humor, fun characters, a terrific voice cast, and sweet, touching story-lines.

The series stars the voices of Eric McCormack, Yvette Nicole Brown, Michael Rapaport, John DiMaggio, Alanna Ubach, Ren Auberjonois, and M. Emmet Walsh.
Betty White also voices a recurring character, whom you'll see in one of the episodes on this DVD.

According to Shout! Factory's website, the episodes on this disc will be:

Episode 1: The Yipper Caper
Episode 11 (season 3): Hello Kitten
Episode 19 (season 3): No More S'mores
Episode 12 (season 3): Beauty is Only Fur Deep
Episode 1 (season 3): Working K-9 to 5

(You will notice that the first episode, ""The Yipper Caper"" has very rough, rigid animation compared to the rest of the episodes on the disc. After the airing of it, the animation studio changed, and the series now has clean, fluid animation)

If you are a fan of this show, then you will definitely want to purchase this DVD.",1391990400,4,1066,4.771739130434782
