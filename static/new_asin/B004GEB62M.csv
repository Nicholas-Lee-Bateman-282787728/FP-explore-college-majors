8428664,3,B004GEB62M,"A small Chinese family builds up a new livelihood in a poor part of London back in the 60s. But the husband has debts and gets entangled with a Chinese crime ring, which puts enormous pressure on him. There are minute observations in ever-new, immaculately composed pictures full of off-colours. The family life relies on respect, hierarchy and tradition; still more than Timothy Mo's namesake original novel, the movie shows the figures as individual personalities with their own agendas. Caucasians only play very minor roles. Still you wonder how well British director Mike Newell is equipped to direct a basically Chinese story; then again, maybe the movie intentionally depicts Chineses for a western audience, i don't know.

Some reviewers call this movie a comedy, but i lean more to another description i found, that of a crime drama. The Chinese gang starts to threaten early on; scenes of violence are short, but utmost brutal, making me frantically search for the remote control. The movie also cuts out some of the comedic scenes from the book, including the driving lessons, the first trips by car and a trip to the airport; while suffering and stress are  amply shown. Scriptwriter Ian McEwan invented a few scenes in the marital bed; they are completely family-friendly and mostly show how the superficially demure lady of the house can be very determined.

When i read the book i found the ongoings within the crime syndicate difficult to follow; in the moview, some things seemed even more cryptic to me. The movie picks up a few other threads from the book without sufficient explanation.

The 4:3 picture was of very good quality, i also enjoyed the full, hi-res sound. My DVD contained another non-related short film, but no more material related to the main movie, including no subtitles whatsoever.",1361923200,,1820,4.996699669966997
