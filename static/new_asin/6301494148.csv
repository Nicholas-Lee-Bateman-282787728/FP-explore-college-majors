If you watch it and don't ""get it"" then you really should really take a step back and assess the direction of your own life because there is a strong chance that it is as absurd as Corey's.",1049414400,5,268,3.9814814814814814
7812574,3,6301494148,"I have loved Corey ever since I can remember, and have collected most of his movies.  I have over 23 so far on vhs.  This was definately a cherry.  The plot is just Corey telling stories, and talking about himself.  The locations that he choses are somewhat chessy, and there is definately some gratuitous bare chested shots, but all in all it is worth it for die-hard Corey Haim fans.  I haven't found it for sale at any stores, but e-bay has it up for sale every once in a while.  Hope this helps guys!",1024790400,5,504,4.252631578947368
