8064031,5,B0009O6ET8,"I was having a major problem with a co-worker at the time this CD came into being.  Using the information Peter presented I made a talisman to dispell the anger between myself said person and allow us to work together, if not peacefully, then at least without the current level of elevated animosity.  Within 3 days after I empowered the talisman the co-worker gave notice and has since left the company.  In the intervening two weeks we were able to co-exist in the same office without trouble.  While I was making and empowering the talisman it gave me pause to think about my attitude and behavior in the situation and how I might have been contributing to the unpleasantness.  Thanks Peter.  You came along with this information at just the perfect time!",1124668800,13,758,4.704545454545454
