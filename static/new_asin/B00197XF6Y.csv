If you're as big a Third Reich fan as I am, you should check this out. I know some other people didn't give it a good review, but I thought the show was really good.",1471651200,,280,4.203703703703703
8272331,3,B00197XF6Y,"As mentioned by the previous reviewer, while the narration is top-notch and very accurate, the same clips are used multiple times for very different events. The reason I gave it three stars as opposed to the previous reviewers two, is because despite having the same clips repeatedly, it does do the job of presenting the battles and major events of the Second World War in a comprehensive and accurate manner. The images are good for something to look at, but the talking is where you learn about the war. It's basically a set of really good lectures that the professor decided to record and stick some images on. Never heard of that happening, but I think that's what it would look like. Worth it for the audio.",1323129600,5,713,4.622047244094488
8272332,2,B00197XF6Y,"Please do not waste your money on this DVD set. If there is one, buy the book the narrator of this set used to read from, and find a better edited movie/documentary to watch.

The lower 2 star rating is a compromise. The historically accurate narration deserves much better - 4 or 5 stars. The video editing deserves no more than 1: not for quality, since every inch used so far has been either news-reel film shot during Hitler's rise to power or battlefield footage filmed during combat, but for editing. The exact same film clips of tank maneuvers and bombing/strafing runs are used while the narrator is talking about the invasion of Poland, the invasion of France, Battle of Britain (thankfully the editors left out the tanks and infantry here) and the invasion of Russia, even though these events took place a year or so apart. I am sure if the discs I have not yet watched include action in North Africa and Italy the same film clips will be brought out once again.

On the two discs I have watched so far every piece of pre-war and war time footage has been used at least 3 times and more commonly 5 or 6 times. The ""once through"" video on the first two discs would probably fit on one with much room to spare.",1268524800,11,1218,4.408888888888889
