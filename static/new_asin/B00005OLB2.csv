If you like Abbott & Costello...The Three Stooges....or The Little Rascals/Our Gang then your going to like these guys. Its fun for the whole family, good viewing you can trust with the kids. Add Bela Lugosi and a little old time spooky fun.

1641076,2,B00005OLB2,"Don't be fooled by the title.  Ghosts have nothing to do with this movie.  This is another encounter of our hapless heroes with the dark master of the  poverty row horror film.  This time the East Side Kids find Bela and his  gang of Nazi spies occupying a local ""haunted"" house.  These  little low budget comedies don't pretend to be any more than they are.  This film has the added attraction of a very young Ava Gardner in the  unlikely role of Huntz Hall's sister.  Bela Lugosi had become a low-budget  standby at this point in his career.  The East Side Kids, if not lovable,  are tolerable in small doses.  Due to a misunderstanding that is worthy of  the Three Stooges, the boys mistake the deserted house for a honeymoon  cottage that needs a good cleaning and decorating.  The spooky manse has  secret panels, revolving bookcases, paintings with moving eyes, and  mysterious people creeping around.  The mild thrills and chills are  suitable for family viewing.  There are a few low brow chuckles, but The  East Side Kids and Bela Lugosi had better luck with the earlier  ""Spooks Run Wild,"" reviewed elsewhere in Amazon.com.  Adjust your  expectations accordingly.  ;-)",968803200,15,1178,4.818181818181818

1641084,3,B00005OLB2,"Ghosts on the Loose & Spooks Run Wild

The 1937 movie Dead End was sited in the lower East Side of New York City. Teenagers were used to show the environment. Their antics amused the audiences and led to new movies with this urban group. When they moved to another movie studio the Dead End Kids became the East Side Kids then the Bowery Boys. In time their audiences diminished. Read the individual reviews for more details.

Ghosts on the Loose, 1943 film
The boys are told of a haunted house on Elm Street. [Manhattan streets are numbered not named.] They clean up a house for a new couple, but pick the wrong house. They also borrow the furnishings. The boys find a printing press in the cellar with Nazi propaganda pamphlets! This is reported to the police, but when they search the house the press is gone! But the boys find the correct location and tell the police. [This story reflects war-time concerns.]

Spooks Run Wild, 1941 film
The boys will travel by bus for a two week vacation in the country. They are told about a maniac on the loose, he has killed three people! They hear howling in the night, so they go outside to explore the countryside. When they hear a shot they seek refuge in a lone house. [Some of these jokes are dated.] The men in town get their guns to search for the monster, and catch him. There is a happy ending.",1477526400,,1346,4.397590361445783

1641086,5,B00005OLB2,"PLOT: the Eastside Kids go to fix up a house for a honeymooning couple when they stumble across some Ghosts....BEST version of this movie I have found.

Eva Gardner and her new husband buy a cute little honeymoon cottage at a ""bargain"" price...why? the big old house next door is haunted. So the GANG want to fix up the ""joint"" for the couple. They get the wrong house and end up at the spooky mansion. It is the ""hide out"" for some Nazis who are printing some Nazi Subversive Pamphlet's. Bela Lugosi heads the Nazis and quickly decides to scare the gang away. Complete with turning bookcase, paintings that turn around and voices. When the boys stumble across the printing press they move it to the cottage. The police show up and decide the whole thing is a prank by the boys. The press is moved several times but finally found in the cottage where the honeymooning couple live.  Muggs and Glimpy discover a tunnel and hidden rooms. One of the VERY best of the Eastside Kids. Long under PUBLIC DOMAIN this is the BEST copy of this movie I have ever seen. Glad someone tried to improve it. 5 STARS~ Watch for Glimpy in a tuxedo they borrowed from a Funeral Home to be BEST man at a Wedding....LOL....",1475366400,,1201,4.454545454545454

1641149,3,B00005OLB2,"I have mixed emotions about this movie. It is old and as such it has poor acting and many slow scenes. But in many ways this is worse than the normal old time movies As such I would give it only three stars.

This is an older movie in black and white. Some of the actors in this movie are poor actors. Some of the actors show promise and with a little bit of training and effort you feel they could be better. Many of the scenes move slowly. I think that is just the way it was done back in the day.

 Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie one night when I was working on writing some lesson plans. It was a good movie for doing something else that took up much of my time and attention but I wanted a little bit of entertainment too.",1383696000,,735,3.9863945578231292

As a youngster, their films made me laugh out loud but this time around I mostly groaned my way through the first 20 minutes of GHOST ON THE LOOSE before I simply couldn't watch anymore. The forced comic tone and slapdash feeling can be attributed to William ""One Shot"" Beaudine. His nickname tells the whole story. Also, it's a Monogram picture, a studio known for its zealous penny-pinching . Then again, the film was made in 1943 and there was a war to fight. Maybe they were rationing humor that week.",1379808000,,599,4.504587155963303

1641157,5,B00005OLB2,"-----I purchased ""Ghosts on the Loose"" because it was a early movie of Ava Gardner; one of the first movies in which she got screen credit--her charaacter actually had a name, instead of just being a ""Car Hop.""  She was good in it.  The movie is enjoyable as a low-brow comedy.  It was fun seeing the movie after reading about it in Ava Gardner's frank and interesting autobiography.  It was a one-take-production deal.  An actor stumbled that was not in the script--they used the shot anyway.  Actually, I thought the stumble improved the movie <grin>.  It was a funny movie; Ava Gardner did her part to make it so.  Her autobiography talks about what a kick she got out of seeing her name on the marque showing the movie, the first time she had seen it there.  Even if you do not care about Ava Gardner, the movie has lots of brilliant slap-stick comedy.  It is worth the price of the DVD.  If I remember correctly, the ""East Side Kids"" is another name for the ""Bowery Boys / Dead End Kids.""  It may be slap-tick comedy, but it is brilliant slap-stick comedy, made by experts in that field.  Watch it; be prepared to laugh a lot. ---Jim",1353283200,,1138,4.4396135265700485
1641158,1,B00005OLB2,"Bought this at at Half Price Books for $4.99. Not a bargin. With the reviews from Amazon I expected a little more. ""Hold That Ghost"" is basically the same movie with more laughs and mystery.",1337299200,2,190,4.457142857142857
1641159,5,B00005OLB2,"The black and white Monogram picture was also known as, ""The East Side Kids Meet Bela Lugosi,"" a cumbersome title at best! It's the 1943 follow-up to ""Spooks Run Wild,"" another Bowery Boys/Lugosi romp which was popular two years earlier.

This one begins a little slow but gets much better as it moves along. Leo Gorcey's sister, (played by Ava Gardner!), is getting married to a guy who has bought a fixer-upper home for the two to live in. Leo's gang goes over to decorate but they stumble into the wrong house, next door, which is bulging with Nazis (""The New Order""), who are, of course, up to no good. From there on, there's a lot of spooky peeping through wall picture eye-holes, shouting, and other buffoonery, but it's all great fun.

While not nearly as good as ""Spooks,"" this is still a great Lugosi entry. If you're not a Lugosiite, you probably ought to pass on this one. However, fans should consider it as the five star flick that I dubbed it.",1192665600,,1137,5.202185792349726
1641160,4,B00005OLB2,"But the only problem as I see it is there is hardly any even bogus supernatural elwment (despite Dracula--Bela Lugosi--being in it).

William Beaudine believes in one takes only if it can be done.  It was not rare for an East Side Kid film to be done in six days.  Boy did he keep a ""one-take"" this time!  Bela thought he would have some fun. The scene where Bela Lugosi is inside the painting and sneezes the offensive word, ""s***"", was the first take.  So Beaudine left it in the film.  The plot this time: Jack (Rick Vallin) is going to marry Betty (Ava Gardner) and they have bought a huge house two miles out in the country from the subway.  Later, the agent tells him, the house next door is haunted.  Mugg's (Leo Gorcey) gets word that the Katzman's mob (an in-joke to producer, Stan Katzman) will crash the wedding.  Bela Lugosi as ""Emil"" is in town. He doesn't want Jack to have that house on Elm Street.  Even Emil's assistant tells him the house next door is haunted.  The assistant gives him some cash and a business card to call to close the deal.  Of course, he will not.  Later, the boys find the card on the floor.  The boys decide to decorate Jack's new house , but they go by the number on the card and go to the haunted house instead.  They don't know the mistake they made.  Watch the fun begin with the boys and Bela Lugosi.  This is Bobby Jordan's last appearance as part of the East Side Kids until BOWERY CHAMPS (1944). In BOWERY CHAMPS he appears as himself in a funny running gag.  Then re-joined them for 8 Bowery Boys films.
