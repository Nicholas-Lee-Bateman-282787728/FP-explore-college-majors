5186705,5,B008WAM2XS,"High Ground breaks the moldy notion of the beleaguered helpless and crazed veteran, so often perpetuated by Hollywood. The focus is eleven wounded warriors who live with seen and unseen wounds, and climb 20,000 ft Mt Lobuche in the Himalayas. The viewer gets an insight of their graphic recollections of war, describing how their wounds impact their lives.  All of the veterans have a variety of wounds --from PTSD, TBI, limb amputations, blindness to anxiety and panic disorders. The audience gets a good idea of what it is like to adjust to a ""new normal,"" or as many of them indicate, the hard part is coming home. Their activities are all filmed in the dramatic and breathtaking views of the Himalayas. Make no mistake: this is not a tourist film about Nepal! It's a human story about veterans, who went to war, along with a mother who lost hers, and now are on the journey home. Both the military community and civilians with no military knowledge, will find plenty to inspire them and be grateful for in High Ground.",1364428800,,1022,4.709497206703911
5186706,4,B008WAM2XS,"I came across the movie poster for this film and instantly ordered it. I was very impressed with the filming and the individuals involved but was left wanting a bit more behind the scenes info. No disrespect at all to the individuals in the film or the director, they have all done s great service.",1356566400,2,298,4.4363636363636365
5186707,5,B008WAM2XS,"This was a very moving, genuine, heartfelt film.  I think everyone should watch this film to better understand the challenges our veterans experience as they reenter society after combat.",1356048000,,187,5.448275862068965
5186708,5,B008WAM2XS,"This movie was amazing. You were brought to amazing places and scenery, wonderful people. It will make you laugh, cry, and you will give it a standing ovation at the end - a definite Must See!!",1355875200,,193,4.388888888888889
5186709,5,B008WAM2XS,"Being a fellow Mountaineer myself was the initial deciding factor to rent this one and I love it, I think unless you have been on a mountain yourself you have no idea the Mental and Physical Challenges you put your body through and for some of these vets to do the same thing while having PTSD is a compounding factor, but I think they redeemed themselves by making it to the top!",1355356800,,380,4.291666666666667
5186710,5,B008WAM2XS,"I bought this DVD after seeing this beautiful film because I simply had to own it.  The characters are incredible, and they--and the filmmaker--are brave enough to tell their stories warts and all. In doing so they expose their vulnerabilities, which makes their achievements that much more remarkable and inspiring.  It's taught me more about the experiences of veterans and Wounded Warriors than any other film, if only by showing the variety and complexity of the issues they face coming home.

The filmmaker allows the characters to tell their own stories in a way that really does justice to the depth of their experiences and emotions. Combine all that with stunning cinematography and a powerful music score and it's hands-down my favorite doc of the year. I must have cried five times watching it and still get tears in my eyes when I think of it.  Thank you to the filmmaker for making High Ground, and to characters in it for being brave enough to tell your stories.

Everyone needs to see this film!",1352851200,4,1010,4.781609195402299
5186711,5,B008WAM2XS,"From Stone Circle Pictures and Serac Adventure Films, veteran Disney Producer Don Hahn and Emmy Award-winning director Michael Brown follow a team of disabled veterans on a dramatic climb of an ice and snow-covered Himalayan peak in ""High Ground.""

Documenting the successful climb of 20,075-foot Lobuche East in Nepal by disabled veterans, ""High Ground"" had an effective festival circuit run during the spring and summer. The documentary has received high praise by critics and audiences, including awards at many festivals.

Since 1993, the non-profit World T.E.A.M. Sports has created exciting sporting events involving disabled and able-bodied participants. The October, 2010 Nepal expedition brought together a group of disabled American veterans with the team of experienced mountaineers who led blind adventurer Erik Weihenmayer to the summit of Mount Everest in 2001. World T.E.A.M. Sports CEO and President Jeff Messner worked closely with Weihenmayer, climber Jeff Evans, and filmmaker Michael Brown in creating and documenting the expedition. The heroic story of the participating disabled veterans overcoming obstacles and challenges in their climb is captivating, encouraging the audience to better understand how disabilities can empower, rather than limit individuals.

With the release of the ""High Ground"" feature, the successful veterans leave a legacy for future climbing expeditions with the disabled.",1352246400,3,1421,5.855072463768116

5186713,5,B008WAM2XS,"Beautifully shot with an incredible soundtrack, and stunning visuals. The film is emotionally gripping as you are drawn into the stories and experiences of the 11 veterans and 1 Gold Star mom. Everyone needs to see this film and start learning about what our veterans go through returning from war.",1351987200,3,298,4.98
8531413,5,B008WAM2XS,"Really solid,engaging movie on an important topic.

What is NOT important is the ""politically correct"" review of 1 star above. As is so common with the politically correct, educated-beyond-capacity crowd, this reviewer cannot tell the difference between his or her personal, political views and what is reality in the rest of the world. Get a life, learn the difference.",1513382400,,370,5.271186440677966

8531416,5,B008WAM2XS,"Deeply moving, sad, and ultimately uplifting documentary that earns its mostly happy ending.  I went in worrying that this portrait of 10 wounded soldiers (some damaged physically, all emotionally), and one mother of a son who had died in action teaming up to climb a giant mountain in Nepal would feel sappy or pat.  But these men and women are so open, so raw and so honest in their stories, their grief, pain and in some cases bitterness, that I ended up feeling more understanding and empathy for what people in uniform go through  before, during and after war  than I remember from almost any other documentary.

Far from get over it, this is all about go through it  starting to heal by admitting and even embracing your scars, not denying them in some macho fashion.  And by concentrating on the personal backstories of these very brave ex-soldiers, by the time we do get to them working as a team to conquer of the massive mountain (in spite of suffering blindness, missing limbs, intense PTSD, etc), theres no sap to be found, just rooting for good human beings to regain control of their lives and pride in themselves, even if just for a moment.  It also gets quite tense in that climb in that not everything goes smoothly or neatly.  Nicely shot as well.  A powerful sleeper of a documentary, well worth seeing and a ridiculously cheap purchase as of this writing.",1461628800,,1375,4.644628099173554
8531417,5,B008WAM2XS,"This movie is perfect in showing those who are critical of disabilities and those who have disabilities that goals and achievements can be accomplished.  Our culture is just at the tip of the iceberg in accepting those with visible or invisible disabilities.  By working with the disability rather than fighting against the disability and finding innovative ways of inclusion,  this film serves as confirmation that if we just think differently many barriers can be broken down.

8531419,5,B008WAM2XS,"I first saw this show on satellite TV and was glad that I could get it on DVD, I've watched it several times already. I would like to salute all the veteran heroes and the one mother of a veteran for intimately sharing their lives and struggles with the world, I honor their service and sacrifice to our great country, their journey up the mountain is truly inspirational for everyone, I would recommend this DVD and story to everyone.",1393286400,,435,4.518987341772152
8531420,4,B008WAM2XS,"Bought it since one of my school mates was in it. Good documentary, gives you an inside perspective of the everyday challenges that our soldiers have. The price of our freedom so to speak.",1387238400,,188,4.5588235294117645
8531421,1,B008WAM2XS,"Although heroic overcoming of serious obstacles and setbacks in life is well worthy of praise and I agree with much of the praise evident in other reviews NONE of those giving the film a five star evaluation addresses a TOTALLY MISSING ISSUE.

Required for SERIOUS students of history is RUSH to WAR DVD.

One reviewer says film ""doesn't aim for political commentary.""

Telling the truth about wars built on lies and deception can not be discounted as ""political"" commentary. Soldiers ""serving"" in ill-conceived tragic wars were lied to as to the reasons for being sent to Iraq. This FACT was ignored in the film. Those ignoring history are condemned to repeat it. Beyond lofty words such as ""warriors"" it is important to identify and understand those who benefitted from the Iraq war. Cheney's Haliburton made over 39 billion dollars from the Iraq War. Students of history will remember Dick Cheney ""having other priorities"" during The American War (sometimes called The Viet Nam War) as he and his friends evaded ""service"" in this travesty. Richard Cheney's nearly unrestrained enthusiasm for the Iraq War was on a par with his stance toward The American War. Any film featuring Iraq War veterans needs to deal with ""chicken hawks"" who sent them to Iraq in the first place. Remember Dick's ""We will be greeted as liberators."" and his STAGED tearing down of Saddam's statue? People need to be reminded of George, Rummy and Dick's LIES.

LIES DO NOT IMPROVE WITH AGE.  War crimes should have consequences:

Over 42,000,000 related hits are only keystrokes away.

Start with ""Rush to War.""
