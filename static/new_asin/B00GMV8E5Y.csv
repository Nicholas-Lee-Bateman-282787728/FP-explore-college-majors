they just needed a better on set military consultant and better, believable, super soldiers...aka at least in shape (I MEAN THATS THE MOVIE PLOT),,,,its knock off wanna be UNIVERSAL SOLDIER in the snow yo !***
im giving 3 stars because of the quality of production and Dominics acting ability...if ur a fan of Dominic ul probally like it ...if ur a fan of good ol  A. C. T. I. O. N.  flicks...save ur time n hard earned COIN ....ITS LACKING SOUL !***",1393372800,12,570,4.367924528301887
6088956,2,B00GMV8E5Y,"""It's imperative I find these three soldiers, extract DNA and verify once and for all whether or not Steinke had genetically modified human beings."" After years of speculation Malraux (Purcell), a scientist, finds a hidden bunker that has been holding three frozen genetically modified Russians. Hoping to study them and figure out their make-up he decides to thaw them out. This act reawakens them and the soldiers continue their original mission. I have to admit I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this going in. The beginning ""back-story"" part of the movie was both interesting and cheesy. The Russians send a group of genetically modified soldiers over here in order to win the Cold War during the Cuban Missile Crises. After that is where the movie starts to go down hill, I can't say its a horrible movie because it wasn't that bad but really just flat. This is the kind of movie you forget what is happening as you watch it and by the end you wonder what made you keep watching. Overall, nothing horrible but not that good either. Very OK and good for a background movie. I give this a C.",1393027200,15,1096,4.654639175257732

6089058,4,B00GMV8E5Y,"Buried beneath the Arctic ice since the Cold War, genetically modified Soviet soldiers have been rediscovered, reactivated and are ready to unleash devastating destruction. They are cold-blooded killing machines with super-human strength and one man, a scientist who has been searching for them his entire life, will try to stop the carnage before they complete their terrifying, top-secret mission. That is the story. My opinion, I was pleasantly surprised. I grant you it is predictable but still entertaining. Dominic Purcell dies an admirable job and the good surprise is Adam Beach as a survivalist living in the middle of nowhere. I liked it quite a bit and the story was one that moved at a good pace. I do recommend it as long as you aren't looking for "" where eagles dare"" or something along that great vain.",1449187200,2,817,4.927536231884058

Purcell stars as a geneticist called in by the government to investigate unusual finds in the arctic that end up answering questions about his past as well.
The show is cast well with good story writing and direction topped by action, intrigue and some good old science fiction.

Disappointed in the severe lack of technical analysis- this would have been a great film backed by some hard core science leaving the viewer with an open door for curiosities sake. A little too typical in the vein of easy come, easy go with the scripting villain versus hero. Great premise for a script- lacking scientific technical analysis to hold a good mind to the screen for long. Ending leaves a doorway open for a sequel.

6089138,3,B00GMV8E5Y,"Ice Soldiers, if you believe IMDB, was rather lame.  I'm here to tell you they were wrong.  It was only somewhat lame.  Actually, it was a little stuff, but that's to be expected with all the snow and cold.  It doesn't stink, but you'll not wish there was Ice Soldiers XIV, V or even II.  One and done and that's fine.  With this movie, that's how it SHOULD be.

The movie worked nicely leaving a tidbit of a clue here and there so that if you were paying attention the big reveal at the end was obvious all along.

Enter Adam Beach as a Cree trapper, T(hunder) C(loud) Cardinal.  Beach provides a little levity to a mostly dry movie.  ""Your guy came through this way and was moving fast,"" TC says.

6089140,3,B00GMV8E5Y,"You know those movies you watch knowing up front that they aren't the best movies ever made but they're enjoyable for the 90 minutes you spend watching them with no intent of ever watching them again? ICE SOLDIERS is one of those movies, a well made and acted film that offers little new in story and plenty of action.

In 1962 during the Cold War a set of three super soldiers from Russia are on their way to attack America. Unfortunately their plane crashes in the Arctic, they attack a nearby base, rape a woman there and wander off into the snow never to be heard from again. Fast forward 50 years later and an expedition have found the three soldiers.

Sponsored by a conglomerate with its own interest in mind the expedition is led by Dr. Andrew Malraux (Dominic Purcell) who has his own agenda in discovering the bodies. Malraux has his own reason for finding these soldiers though (which we find out soon enough but I won't share here spoiling it for anyone. Suffice to say you will see it coming.) The hibernating soldiers are thawed out and rise to wreak havoc on the camp they've been place in. With some new clothes taken from various victims, they head out to complete the task they were assigned years ago.

Malraux and company track down the soldiers as the make their way across country and make their first stop in a town nearby. This lends itself to plenty of action and fighting as well as much mayhem when they interact with the locals.

There is little more in the way of plot to offer here. Suffice to say that the story seems a bit weak but enjoyable enough for a low budget science fiction film. The action pads out the 95 minute length as well as helping hold your interest. The acting is much better than anticipated. Purcell seems to be wasted these days and should get better roles than he's been offered. Here's hoping that happens. Until then I'm sure we'll see him in more films like this. Let's hope that changes soon.",1409356800,,1950,4.484507042253521

6089143,1,B00GMV8E5Y,"Hey gang!  I have a lot of question!  I need answers!

Why cast a group of great actors and give them a plot that turns to lame garbage at about the halfway mark?

Why do Nazi super soldiers who can survive being frozen for a generation, regenerate, and outfight any mortal man die so easily in this terrible plot?

Why do these super Nazi's enjoy rap music?  And even bop to it?

Why do these super soldiers slaughter dozens, but run away from our hero when he's on a snowmobile?

Why don't people who fall into freezing waters get hypothermia?

How does our hero teleport from a snowmobile to the inside of a moving plane?

Why do the doctors and soldiers not strap down or chain superhuman beings they know are murderous Nazi secret weapons bent on American destruction when these superbeings gain all of their strength and are about to wake up?

Ice Soldiers--what does this title have to do with anything in the plot?

THIS MOVIE IS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!  It starts out with such promise.  Really.  Then, it's as if the directing and writing were handed over to a class of mentally ill people smoking marijuana.

Terrible failure, because it had a great idea and followed it nowhere.  Its action was foolish and unbelievable.  Nobody from a ""master race"" likes rap.",1406332800,,1271,4.598214285714286

A scientist discovers three identical blonde Ivan Drago-like Russian super-soldier mutations buried in a state of cryogenic slumber in the snow of the Canadian north. The Russians are awakened to wreak all sorts of havoc.

ICE SOLDIERS seems promising at first, beginning with a very brief back-story-- which is actually much better than the front-story--to 1963, when tensions between America and Russia were at an all-time high. The filming is expertly done: This is not one of those super-amateurish Indies made on a $500 budget, nor is it--thank God!--another ""found footage"" affair. Though a little staid, over-rehearsed, and reminiscent of many 80s/90s thrillers, the acting, directions, and script are all pretty decent. The problem is that nothing particularly interesting happens here, mostly just a lot on the Americans/Canadians fighting it out with the renegade Russians, a bunch of tromping around in the snow, etc. Boorish and predictable for most of its length, ICE SOLDIERS degenerates to just plain silly and unintentionally (?) funny during its last 20-30 minutes.",1394755200,,1090,5.443786982248521
