8441102,3,B004TYAUX0,"It's clean and I don't think there was any cussing. I also learned some memory and test taking tips. It was entertaining and funny at times, and had it's sweet moments. It's probably the first drama where I could watch a few episodes and then go do something else. Which is a nice change, as I don't like to stop a story once I start it. I really like the actress who plays the grandmother. I recognized the chairman, the math, and English teachers from other dramas, too. This is the first time I enjoyed watching the performance of the actor who played the funny English (dancing/singing) teacher. He's a good actor but I didn't care for the parts he played in other drams I've seen.",1378166400,,685,4.444444444444445
