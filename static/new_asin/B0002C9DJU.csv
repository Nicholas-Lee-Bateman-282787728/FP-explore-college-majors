2075834,2,B0002C9DJU,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Uncle Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a good director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography.

In ""Conquest,"" Fulci moves beyond the horror medium into the world of sword and sorcery, with decidedly mixed results. The movie begins with Ilias (Andrea Occhipinti) receiving a magical bow that shoots arrows made of sunlight from some guy that looks like a haggard Santa Claus. His mission, if he chooses to accept it, is to go forth into the world and defeat the evil Ocron (Sabrina Siani) and her violent minions. Ocron is a rather nutty gal; a woman who wears a mask, struts around in the nude, and spends most of her time either on top of a mountain uttering cryptic spells or rolling around in a bed full of snakes. Yeah. Ilias, whose resemblance to Keanu Reeves greatly frightened me, soon runs into trouble with Ocron's goons. Just when we think our boy is down for the count, a wanderer named Mace (Jorge Rivero) enters the picture. He rescues our hero and thereafter joins him for a series of boisterous adventures culminating in the final showdown between Ocron and the sunlight bow. Oh yeah, in order to stop her inevitable confrontation with the thickheaded Ilias, Ocron hires some wizard named Zora (Conrado San Martin) to bring the guy down. That's about it as far as the plot goes.

Fulci packed ""Conquest"" to the rafters with truly mind-deadening dialogue, bad acting, ridiculous situations, poorly choreographed fight scenes, gore, zombies, pustules, nudity, fog, and cheesy special effects. The cinematography--a truly bizarre blend of smoke and shadow that tends to obscure most of the action unfolding onscreen--either evokes the atmosphere of a lost age or cheap film stock bought on clearance. I'm going with the latter. As for the scenarios the two face on their journey across this forbidding land, just think endless hand-to-hand combat scenes interspersed with minimal do-or-die dialogue written by a kindergartner. Mace kills an innocent wayfarer for food. Ilias and Mace battle Ocron's foot soldiers, guys dressed up to look like Chewbacca and who perform these ridiculous acrobatic leaps and flips. Arrows shot at our heroes during one scene look like the editor marked them in on the celluloid with a pencil. Ilias falls ill and Mace nurses him back to health. Zombies rise out of a swamp for no other reason than to have zombies rise out of a swamp. I think what I'm writing here is rather disorganized, but that's what the movie looks and feels like. Things just happen for no reason, and then we move on to the next nonsensical event.

I will say the gore is good. In fact, it's safe to say that the only thing ""Conquest"" has going for it is the blood and guts. It's nice to see the trademark Fulci grue transferred into another film genre--I'm still waiting to see an equivalent amount of gore in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy--so fans of his cavalcade of horrors will likely find something to admire here. We get heads bashed open in sickening close-up on two separate occasions. We get Ilias covered in pustules that seem to ooze for minutes at a time. We get a poor wretch torn in half. We even see Ocron dining on a most unusual delicacy. Yes sir, at least ""Conquest"" contains enough sauce to somewhat obviate the more painful aspects of this clunker. And as much as it pains me to say, ""Conquest"" is a clunker in the same league with the director's dreadful mob picture ""Contraband"" which, if memory serves correctly, came out a year or so before this film. An attempt to cash in on the highly popular sword and sorcery phenomena of the early 1980s, ""Conquest"" succeeds only in embarrassing anyone associated with it. Even Claudio Simonetti's score couldn't save this train wreck.

I'm not going to give the film one star, though. I just can't bring myself to do it, mainly because I do like many Fulci films and also because the DVD isn't half bad. You can tell Blue Underground tried to clean the print up, and they threw in a couple of trailers, a Fulci biography, and artwork stills to boot. If you're preparing to embark on an odyssey through the Fulci filmography, I don't suggest starting here. Begin with ""Don't Torture a Duckling,"" ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" or ""House by the Cemetery"" and work your way down from there. I'm afraid if a novice started here, he or she might never watch another Fulci film again!",1113955200,8,5494,4.672520661157025
2075835,2,B0002C9DJU,"Lucio Fulci...while many may not be familiar with the name or his work, he has developed a dedicated and even hardcore audience, mostly due to the extremely graphic nature of the horror films he made from the late 70's into the 80's.  What some may not know are those films only made up part of his repertoire, as he also was involved in thrillers, musicals, comedies, westerns, and even a sword and sorcery picture, titled Conquest (1983).  This Italian/Spanish/Mexican production (it states this in the beginning during the credits, and, for some reason, it didn't inspire a sense confidence in this viewer), directed by Fulci, stars individuals I've never heard of, including a fairly well muscled Jorge Rivero (Rio Lobo), the very effeminate Andrea Occhipinti (Bolero), and the very naked Sabrina Siani (sounds like a western...The Muscled, the Effeminate, and the Naked).

So what is the film about?  I really wish I could say with a degree of certainty, but the plot, what there was, was pretty convoluted.  There's a young warrior named Ilias (Occhipinti) who, prior to leaving his village (I guess to go off to become more manly), is presented with a magical bow, one that shoots arrows made of pure light, that is once the user figure out how to activate that feature.  Until that happens, it can be used to shoot regular arrows.  Anyway, Ilias goes off, and meets up with a nomadic wanderer named Mace (Rivero), whose main choice of weapon is a very poorly made pair of nunchucks, or, two harden pieces of wood attached by a length of rope.  While they're running around bonding and stuff (ew), a local evil sorceress named Ocron (Siani), I thought it was Okra, as that what it kept sounding like throughout the film, learns of a man with a strange and powerful weapon (the bow...I find it difficult to believe few people in this world had not heard of a bow and arrow, probably one of the earliest forms of ranged weapons) and knows she must possess it for her own.  Also, she's been having dreams regarding her own demise at the hands of a faceless warrior, one who shoots her with an arrow.  In an effort to prevent these premonitions from becoming a reality, she sends her various minions to retrieve Ilias and his weapon, which leads up to a some what climatic final battle between good and evil...a common theme in the genre, a hero, or a group of heroes, suffers adversity to rid the land of a powerful enemy blah, blah, blah...

I've seen a lot of films, and I've seen a number of films within the sword and sorcery genre, and I have to say Conquest falls a bit short in comparison.  It does meet a number of requirements within the genre (heroes, magic, good, evil), but lacks in the execution.  First thing you'll notice is nearly the entire film is shot with a sense that someone smeared Vaseline on the camera lens, giving everything a hazy quality sure to induce headaches early on (the film runs 92 minutes).  Also, Fulci must own stock in a company that sells fog producing machines, as nearly every scene also was inundated with a heaping helping of smoke, further obscuring the viewer's ability to see what's going on...the acting isn't horrible, but the dialog is...an example...Ilias and Mace are trapped in a cave and Ilias spots a snake, to which Mace responds, ""He's harmless if he doesn't bite you.""  Well duh...if a ten-ton boulder was suspended over my head with a piece of twine, it would harmless unless the string broke...the characters themselves are goofy and lacking any sense of likeability.  An example of this is Mace and Ilias (our two heroes) are traveling together, and Mace is learning how to use the bow.  They come across a lowly, completely non-threatening hunter, carrying a dead animal, and Mace shoots and kills him and they take the dead animal so that they may eat it...how very heroic...oh yeah, Mace seems to have a psychic link with animals, and doesn't kill them, but has no problems killing others who've killed animals and taking their food to eat for himself.  Ocron (the evil sorceress) sports a metal, horned bikini bottom and no top, and spends a lot of time having intimate relations with snakes (ew) and eating the brains of her recently killed victims (you see, the head is the `temple of secrets' and it's also quite tasty, or so I've heard).  She commands odd group of henchmen, including wolfmen, regular men, and various animated zombie-like characters, all enabling her to lord over a relatively small group of savages.  Most all the women in the film are topless, which helps, but is entirely gratuitous, serving no real purpose other than to take your mind off the fact the film is so weak in general.  The directing ranges from passable to poor, including pointless POV shots, stupid slow motion that only serves to drag the run time out much further than needed, and ineptly choreographed fight scenes.  I found the mostly electronic musical score to be highly annoying, monotonous, and inappropriate.  Fans of Fulci's stylistic approach to visceral gore will enjoy the inclusion of a smattering of graphic scenes here (brains, puss leaking sores, gore spurting wounds), but it's nowhere near the levels in his horror films, so they may be ultimately dissatisfied.  People not familiar with his penchant for splattery will probably be put off and find it hard to watch.

Blue Underground presents an exceptional widescreen print transfer on this DVD, despite all the funky cinematography.  Special features include two theatrical trailers (U.S. and international), poster and still galleries with lots of good-looking pictures, and a fairly comprehensive and informative biography on Lucio Fulci.  All in all, unless you're a Fulci completist, you might want to skip Conquest, as its' appeal is extremely limited, in my opinion.

2075837,4,B0002C9DJU,"True, sword-and-sorcery is a particularly stupid genre.  It was only done once well, and of course I'm talking about Robert E Howard, and then a few writers like Moorcock, Leiber, and Karl Edgar Wagner came along and created characters that transcended the genre.  We had one truly good movie--the original Conan--and lots of imitations.  And we also had sword-and-sorcery exploitaion flicks, movies that actually ADDED to the amount of gore and sex already in Conan.  This, of course, is a good thing, and Conquest is the whackiest of the whole bunch.  Hell, Fulci even throws in zombies.  The evil wizard chick wears nothing but a gold mask--that's right, she's NEKKID the entire movie.  And for Fulci fans, the main character has an inverted mark of Eibon on his forehead, from Fulci's horror flick The Beyond.  This movie rocks.",1095724800,20,832,4.978260869565218

2075839,1,B0002C9DJU,"Out of all the bad sword and sorcery movies, this one takes the cake. It's so bad, that it's totally funny. Not to mention Lucio Fulci directs it, so there is tons of useless, yet amusing gore. Like there's this one part where these werewolves/bad furry costumes/Chubaccas tear this one person apart by pulling their legs in different directions. It was painful to watch. And theres also a part where this lil pale and wimpy dude got infected and he got these sores all over his body, and they were like pouring this crap out of them. And then these ants crawled all over him and into the wounds. And of course with Fulci directing the whole thing, we got the close up. But thats just some of the eye candy. If you want to know the plot, I don't really know, cuz nothin in that movie makes sense. But I'll give it my best shot. Theres this lil gay dude, and he's got some relation to the god of the sun, or somthing like that. And for some [dang] reason he wants to go kill this lady in a gold mask. And the gold mask is pretty much all she wears. But whatever. But he's so [stupid] that he can't do it himself, so this Fabio-esque man has to come to his rescue. In the mean time, they kill this poor travelor for hunting practice, meet up with these huge frog things in cocoons, get chased by big furry guys, get killed, bla bla bla. Good reigns over evil, the same old crap we get in every sword and sorcery movie. All in all, this is an Italian B-movie, you just can't go wrong.

If you liked this movie, I recommed: watch Deathstalker 2, its hilarious.

What I learned from Conquest: When you hit someone on the head with a stick, all their skin and scalp and hair blows off, exposing all of their brains. Good stuff.

Caution! The DVD is pretty much crap quality, so don't mistake the crappiness for the fog thats in EVERY FRIGGIN SCENE! It drives a person nuts after a while.",1092441600,11,1881,4.2633053221288515
2075840,5,B0002C9DJU,"Ever wonder what a sword and sorcery flick by Lucio Fulci would be like? Look no further than Blue Underground's recent release of Conquest. Ya know, I'd been looking for this movie since I was 12 years old for crying out loud! Thanks again to Blue Underground.
 CONQUEST: We got our first hero who I'll call ""Idiot"", mainly because he is. Idiot is given a magical bow by some old mystic guy. He's not given any particular quest or anything, some claptrap about reaching his manhood. I guess he's just supposed to be an all around do-gooder. The bow is magical because once it runs out of arrows it's able to pull the sun from the sky and shoot really cool blue sun-power arrows. To me this is kind of a lame contraption coz personally, I'd just throw away all the regular arrows and just use the sun powered ones. Our hero doesn't do this coz he's not too bright. Our villian is a topless, masked sorceress who's job is basically to send out her army of men in cheap werewolf costumes to make life miserable for everyone in the land. After a successful raid and a shot of a fantasyland equivalent of LSD/cocaine(administered in the same fashion as launching a spitball), she sees a vision of Idiot coming to kill her, so she sends out her silly Chewbacca/werewolf things to kill him. Around this time we meet our second hero who I call Manowar-basically coz he looks like he may have tried out for the band once, but got the boot. Manowar's job for the rest of the film is to save Idiot's butt when ever he gets captured or in trouble. Manowar is the true hero of the film. This is the basis of our movie. Idiot and Manowar meet lots of perils and dangers while on the run and in pursuit of the masked naked woman until the final showdown. Who wins? You'll have to watch. This film is 100% heckle material. It's very entertaining if you like this kind of thing. Fulci brings his trademark gore to the film(which you kind of wish Peter Jackson would have done when he made a fantasy film), and a funky soundtrack! He also must have attached a fog machine to the camera coz this film looks like it was shot in a cloud. Highly recommended.",1091318400,40,2137,4.396464646464646

Do you wish the LOTR movies were more gruesome and sexualized? If so, you might like Fulci's Conquest--1983. It is the same quality as Fire and Ice or Red Sonja, but it caters to more adult tastes. As expected with Fulci, the graphic violence is occasionally quite jaw-dropping, and (like the Sword and the Sorcerer) the graphic nudity pervades throughout the entire picture.

2075846,3,B0002C9DJU,"Directed by Lucio Fulci (Zombi, City of the Living Dead, The Beyond), this film features loads of lame wookie-werewolf fights, some healthy of gore, a good bit of nudity and almost no discernible plot whatsoever.  This actually has less of a plot than a movie that dares to call itself Deathstalker.  I'm willing to call this Fulci's biggest (and nearly only) failure.  But whatever, I laughed at it a bit.

So, this topless sorceress lady Ocran (Sabrina Siani; Aenigma, White Cannibal Queen) in a metal mask and her monkey-mask-wearing amazons summon a platoon of werewolf-monkey-wookie men to ravage a small tribe of aborigines.  To show that they mean business, these furry mongoloids rip a naked woman in half from the legs up and present her severed head to their naked leader, who then unceremoniously eats the brains right out of it before fornicating with a python...I think...it's not very clear.  Within just 10 minutes of running time it's apparent that the gore, completely pointless nudity and nonsense are set to an ""11"" in this exploitative gorefest.

Armed with his magical bow that shoots six magical arrows at once and penetrates stone, our hero Ilias is charged with ridding the land of evil...I think...it's not very clear.  That's about all the plot we're handed.  Like any adventure movie, he finds an ally during his ""quest.""  Along the way, he meets Mace (Jorge Rivero; Werewolf).  Mace fights some wookie-werewolves with stone nunchucks and some mean WWE moves.  Mace always seems to save Ilias' ass during their frequent and regrettably lame confrontations with Ocran's forces.  In fact, Ilias always seems to get his ass kicked unless he's firing arrows at a distance.  Wuss!

Throughout the film Ocran continues to sick her wookie-werewolves on Ilias and Mace, she periodically rubs snakes all over her body while dreaming about a weirdly faceless Ilias killing her, and she promises her body to some powerful warrior (Zora) if he can kill Ilias.  I have no clue why Zora and Ocran are in cahoots...or even where, who or what Zora is...it's really not very clear!  We also encounter Mace's evil doppelganger, some weird web-covered stone people, acrobatic troglodytes and some random swamp zombies--being that this is a Lucio Fulci movie, I guess that had to happen.  For whatever reason, it seems that Mace does just about all the fighting as if this was his quest...or is it...it's really not clear!

What's really random about this movie is that Ilias is killed, beheaded, and his body burned..but ""his soul lives""...W T F?  We only know because Ocran tells us.  So Ilias, speaking from the spirit world, tells Mace to smear his ashes all over his face to anoint himself with Ilias' power.  But Ilias was a wuss, remember.  He really just should have said ""Yo, Mace, enjoy the magical bow, bro.""  Mace was always fighting his battles for him and saving his hide anyway.  So he's really absorbing Ilias' worthlessness as a warrior.  Right?  That's how I see it anyway.

Oh, right, and for whatever W T F reason everyone has the ability to teleport when it suits them.  Oh, and Mace shoots an arrow through a mountain to hit Ocran in the face.  Oh, and Ocran has a face like a zombie from Planet of the Apes under that mask.  Oh, and...well, it's official.  Everything about this movie is stupid.

They really went for it with the combat choreography, even though the fights were destitute.  A lot of difficult moves are hilariously executed with God-awful technique in slow-motion.  The gore was fun, though presented inconsistently.  My favorite gore was when Ilias was poisoned and covered in pus-looking abscesses.

If you're in the mood to be cynical and tear something apart to make yourself feel better, then this is the film for you!",1380844800,2,3770,4.889589905362776

2075850,1,B0002C9DJU,"In 1983 Lucio Fulci directed an R-rated action-fantasy-adventure film that runs about an hour and a half, touted as an Italian-Spanish-Mexican produced work, starring actors and actresses of those countries.  I've never heard of any of the people in the film.  From what I understand, Lucio Fulci makes tolerable horror films, but this isn't one of those.  It is supposed to be their version of a sword and sorcery saga and it was reported in reviews to have a lot of gore and T &  A.  I sat and watched this English language version DVD start to finish, looked at the ""extras"" hoping to figure out what the heck I must have missed.  What wasn't filmed in a fog was shot in near darkness with bacon grease smeared on the camera lens, except for a few brief short minutes of daylight here and there.  I'd have had to have been extremely tripping on drugs or 4 sheets to the wind intoxicated with alcohol to have been able to enjoy anything about this film.  Seriously.  I've seen easily over a thousand DVD release films, and this is the rock bottom worst piece of poop I've ever seen.  ""Any resemblance to any persons living or dead is accidental""???

2075851,5,B0002C9DJU,"This truly odd film is one of my favorite Italian horror films.  I would describe it as a horror version of one of those sword and sorcery barbarian films.  It begins with a warrior being sent off from some unknown place to rid the world of the unknown evil forces that are ravaging the world.  It seems that a half nude masked sorceress is fooling her followers into believing that she can control the sun, and she controls a army of wolf type men that seem to enjoy splattering the civilians.  One of the wolf creatures whips up some strange drug and shoots it through her nose; this makes her hallucinate and see her own death by the warrior in the beginning.  That guy pumps a bunch of arrows into a bunch of her human soldiers when they jump him; and after Oscron (the sorceress) hears about this, she is fascinated by his bow and arrow and needs the weapon.  Yes, it doesn't make any sense that a magical sorceress is so stupid that neither she nor her entire army can't even make a bow and arrow, but I thought this part of the plot was so absurd that it helped make this weird film even better.  I won't spoil the film, but his bow and arrow gets a big upgrade later on.  The entire film is very fast paced and is heavy on misty atmosphere and gore, and I also thought that the film had great soundtracks.  However, it isn't for everyone.  The film is low budget and it looks low budget.  You might need to have a taste for strange 80s Italian exploitation cinema to enjoy it.  Even if you liked a lot of Fulci's other films like ZOMBIE and THE BEYOND, you still might not like it because it's really strange and it looks cheaper.  The films fast pace accompanied by the pounding Simonetti soundtracks give the film a lot of energy, but a lot of horror fans won't like it.

The DVD quality quality is very good, but the film is so heavy on misty atmosphere at times that it may annoy some people because some may think it interferes with the picture.",1330041600,,1958,4.299727520435967
2075852,5,B0002C9DJU,"I have to jump right into this with both feet and state here and now, that CONQUEST is a sword & sorcery triumph.  To those who would measure this film on its music or 'special effects' to the yardstick of today's Hollywood industry, I say 'Foul!'  To appreciate this film, and I do mean this, one must allow for me to put my case.

Fulci was a master of creating worlds where the viewer accepted all that was seen solely because Fulci placed it before them.  His artistic eye for delivering bizarre horizons, multi-cloured skies, and all manner of life forms while backed up by the pop synthesizer that made the 80s music what it was, had audiences believing what they saw on screen was the norm, and never looked back.

Now, the general consensus of CONQUEST by its detractors seems to be that ""Conquest"" marked the beginning of Fulci's descent into both commercial and artistic mediocrity, and while the former may be true, I'm not understanding the latter. In light of what Fulci's work aspires to be; ""Conquest"" can in many ways be seen as a culmination of his style, and if your best criticisms of the movie are that it's ""plotless and cheap,"" I wonder why you're watching a Fulci movie in the first place.

Yes, the plot is rudimentary hodgepodge that in the end amounts mostly to characters wandering back and forth as an excuse to get them into perilous situations involving traps and monsters, but Fulci's visual sensibilities are positively amazing here, so much so that the limitations of the story become pretty much moot as you take in the fog covered lands and the weird denizens that live there. They make the other-wordly mythic fantasy environment that Fulci attempting to create with what appears to be a shoe string budget and a deserted piece of island property. BUT - It is the foreboding fog-shrouded swamps, ancient stone temples, grotesque creatures and lurid-colored alien skies that will linger in the mind as the work of an artist who clearly has an eye for distinctive visuals. You could only accuse this of being a movie derivative of ""Conan the Barbarian"" if you completely ignored this aspect of it, because I can't think of another film that looks anything like this.

Other aspects of ""Conquest"" work to its advantage in subtle ways. The spare, monosyllabic dialogue helps to create the sense of a primitive and brutish world and the minimalist pulses of Claudio Simonetti's electronic score mesh well with the stunning visuals. Bizarre details - the villainess' gold mask and fascination with snakes, the enchanted bow that glows blue, the dolphin rescue - border on the surrealistic. The effect achieved, at least to this viewer, is hypnotic. I find myself wondering how so many filmmakers today, when they are given all the resources in the world and can't give us one interesting thing to look at, can be treated so leniently by critics who would jump on the bandwagon to slam Fulci without a second thought.",1327622400,13,2946,4.78740157480315
2075853,3,B0002C9DJU,"Fulci is one of my favorite directors, most of his films are enjoyable, gross and simply fun to watch.  This film has a lot of promise, but the way it was shot is almost too distracting to really get the most out of the film.  There is this haze to just about every scene in the movie that becomes frustrating midway through the film.  You want to see the action, to see the effects, but it's separated from you by that hazy ""film"", which looks like someone took a lens and smeared it with detergent so that everything is shot to look odd.  My guess is that Fulci was trying to create a dream-like effect that would last throughout the movie, but i think it would have been much better if he had simply left that out, or at least, created dream sequences that employed the technique, rather than subjecting the viewer for the duration of the movie.

Aside from this huge problem, I thought it was still fun enough that I'll probably watch it again at some point.  There is a decent amount of fun stuff (pus filled wounds, a bow that shoots laser arrows and a topless sorceress that does NOT shoot lasers from her eyes as the cover art suggests).

If you like barbarian films, you should see it once.  It's definitely a weaker entry, but still has fun moments.",1319414400,,1259,4.373390557939914

2075855,5,B0002C9DJU,"Made at the height of the Sword and Sorcery craze in the early eighties thanks to John Milius's 'CONAN THE BARBARIAN',this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because so many people that have seen this film with me think I'm absolutely crazy at giving it repeated viewings .  Sorry, Blue Underground has restored all of the soft focus and gritty feel into a wonderful viewing experience.  This is the closest I've ever seen the paintings of Frank Frazetta come to life right up to the beautiful SABRINA SIANI  as the stark naked femme fatale wearing nothing but a bronze mask. Yeah, the makeup is shoddy and it has a unique electronic music score that 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' fans may shudder at but these elements give the film its charm. Fulci's vision is fabulous and I love every minute of this film.  It's great to be crazy.",1274659200,4,827,4.6438356164383565
2075856,2,B0002C9DJU,"Conquest is just one of many Sword and Sorcery ""epics"" that were released in the wake of the success of Conan the Barbarian. Directed by Lucio Fulci, a man more known for his horror films than for his fantasy/adventure forays, crafts a delightfully crappy film with delightfully crappy dialogue, acting, and a meager see-hair of a story.

The film ""stars"" Andrea Occhipinti who resembles a younger, effeminate version of Hugh Jackman...with a perm. Jorge Rivero who starred in the classic supernatural thriller Werewolf (or Wherewilf depending on which actor in the movie you asked to say it) that was riffed on by the boys at Mystery Science Theater 3000. And finally, the villain of the movie is played by Sabrina Siani who remains nude for the entire film with a metal mask hiding her true face. The perfect woman (I'm kidding, don't send me hate mail or hate comments)!

So explaining Conquest is certainly not an easy thing to do. Seeing as how there isn't really a story or cohesive plot or likable characters, this is going to be a rough ride.

Apparently this young warrior named Idiot (that's what it sounded like his name was) is given a magical bow that can shoot light out of it and stuff and this older guy wants him to use it. On a quest or something. That part's kind of vague. I was getting the impression the old guy was tired of Idiot hanging around waiting for his perm to set and mooching all the Nair. Other people want to be hairless as well ya jerk!

Idiot has no idea how to use the magical bow and I don't think the old guy did either so that's why he gave it away. I can relate. I had a Transformer when I was kid that I couldn't figure out so I gave it away. I think that relates to this. Maybe. So until Idiot learns how to shoot light from the bow, he just has to settle on regular arrows.

In his travels, Idiot meets up with Mace; an obvious schizophrenic older companion who carries around stone nunchucks and kills people indiscriminately. But he loves the animals so we can forgive him the occasional murder.

Idiot and Mace bond; a lot. Mace is a loner and Idiot needs a man around to do some of the fighting I guess. Anyway, the evil villain Destro...I mean Oprah (okay, her name is Ocrah or Ocran but the audio is horrible so I could never hear the name clearly) learns of this weird contraption called a ""bow and arrow"" and she must possess it immediately. Obviously there are no other bow and arrows in the ancient world. You know. The ancient world where bow and arrows first came into existence?? She also starts to have visions of this guy killing her with an arrow so it makes sense to track down the only jerk in the world who has one. So she sends her unholy horde of mutated Care Bears, human mercenaries, shape-shifting wizards, killer grass, swamp zombies, cave monsters, and the awesome cobweb monsters who speak in broken English after Idiot.

By now, I'm so used to bad movies that I've become quite numb to them. What would make others squirm and walk out on, I can proudly sit through. Conquest is a bad movie all around with barely any redeeming factors other than the high percentage of gore and nudity.

The film itself seems to be shot with a light sheen of Vasoline smeared on the camera lens so everything has this hazy, As The World Turns daytime drama effect. Another aspect of Fulci's annoying direction was the absurd choice to film a lot of scenes with the camera facing the sun. All we see are fuzzy outlines of the actors. Another particularly fun time was when our hapless heroes are in a cave and it's completely dark. Combined with the horrible haze of the film in the first place and a lack of even subtle lighting, all you see are vague shapes and outlines of people mixed with growls and voices.

If you like fog in your films, you're going to love this one though. Fog is everywhere. The filmmakers must have bought out every fog machine they could find or had a friend who knew a friend that had a guy who could get them cheap fog. We all have one of those guys, so I'm sure that's what happened.

All in all, Conquest isn't a movie for people with no time on their hands, lives, or girlfriends. Which is why I watched it several times. It's entertaining in a Mystery Science Theater way if you can get together with a bunch of friends to riff on it. Two dramatic scenes did impress me however so I will leave you with their epic awesomeness.

One, the dolphin rescue scene. And two, the first thing the credits reveal at the end. You just have to watch it to believe it.",1265587200,3,4545,4.41816009557945

I eagerly awaited after many years of reading colorful reviews, of having my own copy of this particular ""it's so bad it's good"" film, ala Beast Master.

Some said previously this was ""mind-numbing"". I wish it was so, then perhaps my own head would not have hurt so much. Having been made in the era of 80's low-budget is not an excuse for the level of badness this movie achieves. You've read it all in other reviews; fog (yup, in abundance), dialog (as bad as they all say), forgettable and unsympathetic characters (every one of them...Mace is almost tolerable), bad acting, bad effects (beyond 'cheese'...when I was 12, I had a friend with whom I made some 8mm animated films to pass long summer days back in L.A. with special effects that would have put this film's effects to shame), bad directing...quite literally, the ONLY thing(s) this movie has going for it are the numerous topless women (apparently, in Fulci's fantasy world, no women wear garments that cover breasts...ever...thankfully, they're all at least reasonably attractive).

I would have to say this is one movie I can not possibly recommend...on any level...to any one...regardless of the postscript qualifier I might add.

I like this film and I really can't add anything that hasn't been said in previous reviews. I would add that, if you like Sabrina Siani, you might look for a copy of ""Throne of Fire"" (Also early 1980's). I think it is probably her best film.
This film, ""Conquest,"" can really leave you with a vague sense of loss.

8025843,3,B0002C9DJU,"Conquest could've been one of my Top 5 Lucio Fulci films. I wanted to love it, but the entire thing looks like it was filmed in a cloud, using a Kodak disposable with a wax paper filter. Trust me, that's barely an exaggeration.

The gore is in full force. The cheese is delicious! There's swords, leather, and loin cloths. There's sun-powered, laser-shooting bow-and-arrows! There's an army of creatures in cheap monster masks. But, thanks in part to then-noob camera man Alejandro Ulloa, the picture quality is so mired in filters, soft focus, and fog, it obscures most of what's going on. For the entire movie. Some moments are clearer than others, but it's incredibly frustrating. Especially since our villain is the gorgeous Sabrina Siani, who struts and lays around in almost nothing whenever she's on screen. The most unfortunate thing about the picture quality is that it really can't be cleaned up. It's not a matter of dirt or dust on the film print -- this is how it was lensed.

So why is the cinematography so bad? First and worst mistake Fulci made: he abandoned the 2 guys who helped make his previous movies so awesome, in favor of less-experienced writers and cinematographer. Pre-Conquest Fulci teamed up with DP Sergio Salvati and writer Dardano Sacchetti. This ""spaghetti terror"" trio blessed us with classics The Psychic, Zombie, and Gates of Hell trilogy. But when it came time to make Conquest, for reasons beyond rationality, Fulci (literally) cut them both out of the picture. His second screw up was bombarding the set with an outrageous amount of fog, hoping to give the film a dreamlike quality. Instead we end up with a ""what the hell was he thinking!?"" quality.

Scathing rant aside, I'm a pretty forgiving Fulci fan; not only will I keep this in my collection, but I think it works on a ""so bad it's entertaining"" level. I must enjoy the abuse.",1461715200,2,1874,4.795665634674923

8025849,2,B0002C9DJU,"A box-office flop at the time of its release in 1983, Lucio Fulci's attempt to make a sword and sandal flick doesn't quite work the way it's supposed to, possibly because there's more smoke and fog than an original plot.  Bad lighting, ridiculous costumes, unfortunate makeup, masks galore, and awkward close-ups don't help either.  It's not just the indistinct dreamy quality of the cinematography that's at fault; the story is also vague and repetitive.  It follows the adventures of a youth named Ilius who has a magic bow.  He isn't exactly given a quest he just wanders around saving people and needing saving himself; enter Mace a loner with an affinity for animals.  They wander around fighting and evading the sinister wolfmen led by the EVIL Ohkren.  (She can afford a golden mask but has little else to wear.)  Worried for her life, Ohkren summons Zora who vows to kill the wanderer Ilius.  Can anyone stop her reign of terror before boredom sets in?

It's bad enough that most of the daylight shots are overexposed and lost in a haze of smoke, even worse, the pivotal fight sequence is done entirely in the dark, the results displayed after the fact.  Nudity and some gore (not enough as far as I'm concerned) are peppered here and there, lost in the vast stretches between these scenes.  I expected more from Fulci.  This left me disappointed and confused as to why he would want to attempt this type of film.

Nostalgia is a powerful force for me. Also, I like things that do not follow the ""mold"" so-to-speak. If Conquest stands out in anything, it doesn't follow expected story traits. Also, there is extreme gore and nudity.
