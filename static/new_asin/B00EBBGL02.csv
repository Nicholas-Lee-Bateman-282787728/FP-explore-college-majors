8603429,5,B00EBBGL02,"I'm not typically into children-type movies so I wasn't excited about ""Dolphin Tale"" when I came across it one night on T.V.  But I remembered when this story was all over the news.  I remember thinking the idea of making a prosthetic tail for a dolphin was absolutely ridiculous UNTIL I watched this movie. It didn't take long to realize it wasn't a just for children'.  It was an inspirational docudrama for children and adults alike.  I bought it to add to my D.V.D. collection to watch with my present grandchildren (over and over again) and future grandchildren.  It's a very great movie.",1392940800,3,593,4.718446601941747
