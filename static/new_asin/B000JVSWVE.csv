8153356,4,B000JVSWVE,"The videos came swiftly, except one...  it was about a week later than the rest.  But that's ok.  Everything was in good shape.

I was disappointed in that I was looking for a couple of episodes in articular which I'd enjoyed in the past.  But they were not there.  I watched the the entire set twice looking for them, but to no avail.  Then I researched information online and discovered that there are actually six seasons, not five.

I believe it's a bit misleading.  I understood that it was to be the entire set of all seasons... but now I have to get the sixth season separately??",1301702400,,586,4.401869158878505
8153357,5,B000JVSWVE,"Ordered this for a Christmas gift in 2008. In my internet search for the complete Hogan's Heroes DVD collection I found several sites selling what appeared to be pirated versions of this collection and at a much higher price than I paid at Amazon for the legal, quality recorded set. At the time this was the most complete Hogan's Heroes collection legally available. My husband believes there may be a few more episodes to surface in the future. He has spent the past 11 months happily replaying his personal Hogan's Heroes collection. As usual, Amazon shipped promptly and the merchandise was as described. Will definitely do business with this store again.",1259193600,,659,4.945945945945946
8153358,5,B000JVSWVE,"I ordered the box to europe, shipping and toll was excellent!
The box set is nice and each DVD has his own case.
But every season is in a different box, there not a box where all seasons
Are packed together.

I would order it again!

8153360,5,B000JVSWVE,"Hogan's Heroes seasons 1-5 was great for the person I gave the DVD to. He was in the service during the time it was air on T.V. He enjoyed the humor that was put into the production of Hogan's Heroes. I myself have sat down, watch some and honestly can say I enjoy it. It is a clean program which today is a plus.",1197763200,,313,3.90625
