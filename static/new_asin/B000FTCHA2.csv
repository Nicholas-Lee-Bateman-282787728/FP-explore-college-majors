8126336,1,B000FTCHA2,Ordered the product based on photo shown on listing. Received totally different movie. :(,1445558400,,89,5.428571428571429
8126337,1,B000FTCHA2,"This was the lamest DVD set I have ever bought for my child. I thought it would be more modern, but it reminded me of something from the 80s. The Disney Channel does a better job at teaching your infant/toddler their shapes, colors, motions, etc.",1444608000,,246,4.488888888888889
8126338,1,B000FTCHA2,This video is very very boring and does not keep my 2yr old attention. It barely kept my attention. I would not recommend this to anyone!!!,1441756800,,139,4.384615384615385
8126339,4,B000FTCHA2,"Ooooooooooh Dukey and Dotty! Our 2 year old son CAN'T get enough of the Dukey and Dotty Duck DVDs. These DVDs are corny but completely engaging for our boy. He knows the DVD case and will go get it himself shouting Agee! Agee! (""again"") when they are finished. A day doesn't go by that we don't watch them two or three times in a row. Sure, some of the sound effects are a bit out there but they are also enjoyable to the simple and developing mind of a child. I enjoy the smiles that he gives me when he sees his favorite scene. There are a couple of misses, as far as content go (i.e. when sock puppet is asked to show a leaf and he presents a rose with leaves, he is told he is wrong, when technically he DID bring a leaf with a rose attached) but this is where parenting kicks and you those glitches, if you will, allow for teaching opportunities. Overall, these DVDs are very well done and I will be seeking out the others to include in his library.

The packaging, however, gets only ONE STAR. The graphics are fine and the front cover opening into a book to describe the three titles included is fun for our child. But the DVDs come STACKED in one case. This is NOT good for the DVD or for the child who is learning to make choices. I had to buy three DVD cases to separate them so that they are more kid friendly.",1435104000,,1321,4.12015503875969
8126340,4,B000FTCHA2,very intriguing for young minds... i like how they show actual (real life) pictures as well as cartoon pictures. they are right with age group my 15month old enjoys and my 4year old is also captivated: ),1427500800,,203,4.513513513513513
8126341,1,B000FTCHA2,"thought it taught words,  bunch of singing and music",1421539200,,52,4.777777777777778
8126342,5,B000FTCHA2,"My son has been watching these since he was only a few weeks old. He has loved them! This set has grown with him. In the beginning he could watch ""sights and sounds"" and ""musical instruments,"" but now that he is 1 year old, he has outgrown those and watches ""First Words."" We have some of the other So Smart Dvds as well, and these are great for infants. I recommend these to all new parents.",1206316800,,392,4.171052631578948
8126343,2,B000FTCHA2,"I have this set and the ""letters, shapes and colors"" DVDs which I do like.  These videos are way to primitive for toddlers who already know what things are and are talking even a very little bit.  When my boys were about 18 mos old I bought both sets and I never could get them to watch this set or justify watching it.  Instead, our favorite was ""Baby Shakespere"" which has music, descriptive words and poems.  Just now they like the sounds DVD but I don't so we don't use them at all.  Instead of these, I recommend you purchase the letters, shapes and colors DVD's which are much more educational.  Also, understand that these DVD's are only good with parental interaction.  When I put them on, I sit down with my twins (2 yrs old) and we talk about what we see.  They are primitive animations that, in my opinion, are good for teaching because of the lack  distractions.  If you are looking for videos with cutesy characters that are going to entertain while you clean the kitchen or make dinner, etc. - these will not fulfill that wish.  Choose something else.  If you are looking for a platform to stimulate learning and parental involvement, then you might like this or the other set.",1174521600,3,1191,4.488372093023256
