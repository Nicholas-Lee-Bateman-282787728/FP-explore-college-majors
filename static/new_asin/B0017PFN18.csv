I refer to the boringly repetitive battle scenes that intercut and interfere with the ongoing history.  Personalities of the emperors dominated, as well they might, but there was almost no one else focused on in the series.  Shallow on too many points.

3174783,5,B0017PFN18,"This series on Rome was overall very good in my opinion.  Learned things I didn't know of before like the Forest of Death and the Puppet Master.

Perhaps they could follow these 4 DVD's up with more on the topics of... say... the lives of Nero and Commodus, the Roman-Jewish Wars, and the Year of the Four Emperors; perhaps touch on how Pompey entered into the Holy of Holies in the Jewish Temple and expand more on the First Triumvate and their exploits.",1237161600,,455,4.469879518072289
3174784,3,B0017PFN18,"It is commendable to try to explain the rise and fall of the Roman Empire in a few hours of video time while at the same time trying to be entertaining.  There are many possitive aspects of this product:

1.- It covers the lives of many interesting characters, I especially enjoyed the chapters devoted to Marius and the rise of the Empire (his army reforms professionalized the roman army while his use of the army in a clientelar form was imitated by later demagogues and tyrants ultimately overthrew the republican system and in turn created the imperial system which was a quasy military dictatorship), Aurelian who had to fight during his whole life to keep the empire from splintering and sinking, and of Stilicho who gave the western empire a few more decades of life against the threat of the gothic and german invasions.  These historical figures are not usually covered in popular histories of Rome and it was refreshing to see a documentary that addresses them while the lifes of other characters such as Caesar or Augustus have been covered thoroughly in literature and film.

2.- It is not boring , it provided a measure of entertainment maybe because the subject covered is mostly military, many action sequences are readily provided.

3.- It gives some insights from the academics that are interviewed in the show that try to give you some perspective in what you are watching.

To balance this out it has some very bad aspects to this:

1.-  It does not convey well the passage of time, for example the roman legionaires are portrayed during the whole 600 years that the show encompasses as imperial legionaries of the 1st to 2nd century with the use of the lorica segmentata and imperial helmets.  It never addresses the changes of tactics, equipment, dress and the racial composition of the army that took place during all these centuries starting with a full citizen corps in republican times armed with pilum, gladius and covered with mail shirt and coolus helmet of republican times to the army of the late empire composed mainly of gothic and germanic soldiers using equipment such as long swords (spatha), round shields with the chi-rho simbols of the christian legions.  They never talk about the changing of tactics from close order of the republican legion to a more open and flexible imperial legion to the preponderance of the cavalry and the mobile army of the late empire.  This is sad since this is supposed to be a military history documentary of the history channel.

2.- It explains everything in terms of military  prowess and generalship.  Good military leaders Rome expands and gains ascendancy over its enemies when leaders are weaker Rome suffers setbacks.  It never addresses the economic and cultural changes that ultimately were the cause of the fall of the western empire.  The empire went bankrupt with the need to keep a huge standing army and this created one of the reasons for the collapse.  The reason for the ascendancy of a military power stems from its internal wellfare the better developed and rich the society is the better warriors and leaders it produces.

3.-  Religion and culture are almost left behind, we hear about the impact of christianity more because of the persecution of christians than any impact this religion made on the culture and moral fiber of the roman society, the documentary falis to explain how things worked in Roman society and almost makes us believe that the only worthwhile pursuit in the empire was soldiering.  Rome was strong becuase it created and exported an strong culture, it not only conquered militarily but also subjugated by romanizing its foes.

4.-  The battle scenes are repetitive foes and romans always look the same and it feels that there are not enough extras and the battles seem small affairs.  This aspect betrays budget problems.

Overall you have a mediocre product that does not live up to its expectations.",1233705600,113,3918,4.88368580060423
3174785,4,B0017PFN18,"Over all it is a good product. Two things bother me, however, so many topics are covered very little time is devoted to any one subject, and as such many generalizations are made; this is not to say, it is inaccurate, because it is. My second bother is that, the overwhelming majority of the documentary focuses on the military of Rome, while no one could argue the signifigance of this enitity, too little emphasis in my opinion is given to the polical and cultural world of the Roman Empire.

3174829,3,B0017PFN18,"This is a large set with a lot of content, but much of it is lengthy reenactments over very small events in Roman history, it gets overbearing, and boring.  Also, this series starts halfway through Roman history instead at its origins.  It also doesn't tell the general story of Rome as it moved over time, we have to infer it from numerous little stories about very specific events or concepts.

This isn't a bad documentary set, it's o.k.  But It greatly pales in comparison to the Rome: Power & Glory documentary set, so if you want to just buy one series on Rome, I would recommend the other documentary set instead.  Lots of good stuff to learn in here though, and if you want a lot of details about specific events than get this.  If you just want to learn about what Rome was and how it came about and fell apart, watch Rome: Power & Glory instead, it does that much more clearly and in half the viewing time (and half the cost).",1399075200,2,936,4.350574712643678
3174830,5,B0017PFN18,"History Channel's 13-episode ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire"" is fast-moving and insightful, giving an overview of Rome's major military campaigns between the first barbarian war against the Roman Republic in the 2nd century BC and the last emperor in 5th century AD. The series is slick and well-edited, juxtaposing excellent battle recreations with punchy analysis by historical experts. Each episode is 44 minutes long (presumably leaving a lot of time for commercials when the series aired in one-hour slots on TV) and is as action-packed as military history gets. I particularly like how ancient Roman historians (Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch, et al) are continually quoted to describe events.

Unfortunately, the exclusive focus on military exploits leaves the impression that Rome rose and fell on its military might, leaving out most of the political and religious/social factors that played a role in the empire. Rome's contribution to world culture and its system of religious worship is almost entirely neglected. In fact, I was surprised that the first episode launched right into the first barbarian war without any historical context whatsoever, as I had believed a series on the history of Rome would begin more fittingly with at least a nod to the foundational myths and earliest historical records of the Romans prior to the Republic's formation. In fact, the first episode is rather dull, presenting Rome's early expansion in a way that merely sets up the Roman-Barbarian opposition that this series sees as the sole fact in Rome's success and ultimate collapse.

All the same, some of the episodes are truly excellent, particularly ""Spartacus"" (episode two) where we learn quite a bit about the slave revolt's stunning victories and little-known military tactics (i.e. the slaves rappelling off ropes to escape a mountain and the Romans building a defensive wall across southern Italy to trap the slaves) used by both sides. Some later episodes like ""Constantine,"" describing the empire's Christianization, are fun and informative. Likewise, ""Julius Caesar"" (episode three) features an incredibly exciting summary of Caesar's stunning rise to power through the Gallic wars. The Caesar episode is so fixated on the Gallic wars that it gives us very little else, merely nodding at Marc Antony's presence in Caesar's army without giving any explanation whatsoever for Augustus succeeding Caesar (the entire fight for succession between Antony, Brutus, Octavian, et al is omitted) and becoming the first emperor. One wishes this episode had been drawn out a bit more or continued in the next episode. Still, it's pretty compelling in its overview of Caesar's rise to power.

As the series progresses, one grows increasingly surprised at what is omitted by the producers, particularly the details of succession to the empire's throne. Augustus is almost entirely neglected except for his reactions to failures in the German campaign and Caligula's death is described almost as a footnote. After awhile, the series also becomes repetitive, giving so many battles and maps that one starts to tire of it. Many iconic moments in Roman history are ignored or brushed aside in favor of the war chronicles.

In the final analysis, the series is extremely exciting and fun as a military history, particularly if you take it in episodic chunks at your leisure rather than trying to go through the whole thing in a short time frame. Each episode is a pretty rich feast of historical information compressed into a very brief timeframe, making it ideal for classroom use in a history course or study group. The box set is also one of the History Channel's better packagings, offering the four-disc set in a neat fold-out box that features attractive artwork and one special feature on the last disc (""Barbarian Battle Tech"" documentary) that is fun for military hardware junkies. If you're a guy, you'll love the military history focus of the series, and it's an entertaining companion for any study of Roman history. It's just a bit light on context.",1392508800,3,4055,5.195718654434251

3174832,4,B0017PFN18,"The customer reviews says a lot about this film Rome rise and fall of an Empire. The History Channel usually puts out some nice films on ancient history, but this one was a disappointment. The battle scenes are too repetitive; barbarians seem to always attack charging down a slope, many roman street scenes look the same overall just bad footage. However, if you are a history buff and have not covered the Roman Empire as part of some other films by the History Channel I think you could benefit from owning this DVD.",1390521600,2,519,4.591397849462366

3174834,3,B0017PFN18,"To anyone considering renting or buying this series, I would suggest they first determine what it is they are hoping to get from it, because this production's positives and negatives are highly relevant to the viewer's expectations.  My own were entirely out of place; I was interested in learning the connecting chains of cause and effect that led to the downfall of the Roman Empire, and at the same time hoping to shore up my knowledge of the figures from its latter years.  With a subtitle of RISE AND FALL OF AN EMPIRE, I don't think those expectations were unreasonable, though I had a feeling, based on previous experience with the History Channel, that they might be hard to meet.

There are several one and two star reviews that detail the technical mistakes of this series - such as improper equipment during some scenes - and that also take it to task for what they believe to be glaring omissions, slip-shod analysis, and even some factual errors.  I would encourage potential viewers with exacting demands to take a look at those reviews, because I'm confident those problems do exist - I'm just not expert enough to pick them all out and list them.  Again: You have to know what it is you are looking for in this series.  To me, many of the problems with the reenactment scenes are just not that important because to my mind, they exist not to give an exact representation, but as a sort of visual aide to the imagination.  So when I see about thirty 'Roman Legionaries' and thirty 'barbarians' standing in for tens of thousands, who then go on to mix it up in the same stretch of woods that every other 'battle' takes place in, I'm not terrifically upset.  I can see how it would bother some viewers though, and truthfully, watching these episodes in fairly rapid succession magnifies the problem even to me - if one had watched when first aired, the similarity of setting, the replaying of the same footage for events separated by decades if not centuries, and the paucity of men in battle would be much easier to overlook.  To me, it was an minor irritation.  To others, it might be a deal breaker.

Far worse, in my opinion, was the utter lack of causality in the series.  The subject of each episode seems as though it exists in a vacuum, with little relation to the one previous.  Rather than highlighting events that forced social and structural changes within the empire, it seems that the focus is on the sensational and the superficial.  For instance, by the time one gets to the end of the third disc, one might think that the only difference between the Rome of Julius Caesar's day and that of Constantine was that Christianity had come onto the world stage.  This lack of a chain linking one event to the next also makes it difficult for me to retain the significance of major figures, and even to keep the timeline straight.

As far as the analysis provided, I think it is okay as far as it goes, but it strikes me as oriented toward perhaps a tenth grade level history course.  It's probable that it couldn't be any other way - there simply isn't enough time allotted to cover so much history.  And, with only one exception, enough professors are used so that no one analyst feels overused.

The high point of the series is probably the fact that much history that rarely gets examined receives its due here - and thankfully, not too much (or too little) time is spent on events that have been exhausted elsewhere.  So, no Cleopatra and the asp, no Nero and his fiddle.  Given the other problems this series suffers from, this powers the rating back up to three for myself.  I liked it more than not, though I watched it while walking on a treadmill, and my thankfulness for the diversion may have affected my opinion.  Plus, I feel more enlightened than if I had watched a Family Guy marathon.  Rent first if you're interested.",1388620800,2,3857,4.5726744186046515

3174838,1,B0017PFN18,"This series consists mostly of badly re-enacted battle scenes or even weaker attempts at Roman street scenes.  (One gladiatorial fight, with the triumvirate of Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus present, is depicted in what looks like an arena for training ponies; the shouting crowd consists of maybe a hundred people.  It's absurd.)  A great deal of what is shown is inapt or inept.  Every battle occurs in the same landscape, one that never looks anything like the place in  which it is supposed to be taking place.  Vast numbers of legionnaires are represented by a handful of men.  The actors mostly remain unchanged through time, rarely look appropriate for their roles (the man who plays Brutus is particularly wrong for his part), and seem completely uncomfortable in their costumes.  The man who portrays Spartacus is shown as if he were a porn star.  The episodes make huge leaps in time with very little connection made between the eras.  Almost no attention is paid to Roman cultural, social, or intellectual life, no matter the period.  Much of the music is not only bad; it is so overbearing that it is difficult to hear the narration.  Because the series was made for TV with ads, there is endless repetition, supposedly joins between sections that had been interrupted by commercials.  There was no re-editing after the ads were deleted.  The commentators are fair, but what they have to say for each episode might be reduced to a paragraph or two.  Someone utterly ignorant of Roman history might learn a thing or two from listening to them, but no one else.  For the most part, what they have to say is at best superficial and far more quickly to be found elsewhere.  One wonders why a few of them become so animated when speaking since what they have to say holds so little interest.  This is history viewed on the cheap, much of it silly, none of it profound or genuinely provocative, a comic book version of the real thing.  Don't waste your time on it.",1380585600,6,1967,4.715542521994135

After looking through all of the available Rome documentary's to pick from I finally decided to choose this documentary made by the History Channel. History Channel always makes good, accurate, and interesting documentary's but I was still skeptical and unsure if this was going to be a good documentary. In the end I decided to take a chance and was not disappointed at all. ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire""  is extremely well done and covers a wide variety of people and events during the 600 years that Rome ruled.

1. The documentary covers multiple Roman Emperors (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, etc.)

2. The documentary covers multiple Roman Generals (Gaius Marius, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Julius Caesar, Avidius Cassius, etc.)

3. Covers multiple Roman conquests or attempted conquests (Britannia, Germania, Gaul, Macedonia, etc.)

Overall this was an amazing documentary, every episode you learn a great deal about Rome and the leaders who led it throughout the centuries. The documentary is not boring at all, keeps you interested all the way through each episode, and teaches you nearly everything you want to know about the Roman Empire.

If you're looking to learn more about Rome, and the Empire that ruled for nearly 600 years and want to find the right documentary, then this is definitely the documentary to pick. Definitely a 5 out of 5.",1364947200,3,1552,5.01556420233463

3174844,4,B0017PFN18,"This 13-part series, originally aired on the History channel, is a documentary covering Rome's ascent into an empire, starting in the second century BC, and its eventual collapse in the late 400s.  As with many documentaries, it is a blend of interviews with historians, live action sequences with actors playing Roman statesman, and extras recreating battles.  The main strength of this series is that it captures both many significant events and the larger sweep of history.  Inevitably, some events are omitted.  The Punic Wars, in which Rome defeated Carthage and gained control of the Western Mediterranean, are not mentioned.  Instead, the series begins with Rome's northern campaigns in the next century.  Similarly, the campaign against the Huns, in which Roman and Visigothic forces turned back the Asiatic invasion in 451, is brushed over.  The series devotes more time to political intrigues and civil strife than to other causes of Rome's decline.  There were other causes, which were arguably more important: a series of epidemics depopulated the empire just as population pressure was driving the barbarian invaders westward.  Despite this, the series is basically successful.  Watching it, one gets a sense of high drama playing out over a span of several centuries.",1363651200,4,1281,5.3283582089552235

I would suggest another disc covering about Romulus and Remus, the Rape of the Sabines, Marcus Furius Camillus, Horatius who kicked out the last king Tarquin, Coriolanus against the Volscians, The Horatii and the Curatii in the fight against Alba Longa, and all those early great Romans, including the guy who jumped with his horse and armor into a sinkhole in the ground as a sacrifice.

There is just fight scene after fight scene..and they all look similar..after 100 times of it...you just want to turn it off...as the narrator has already irritated you beyond the point of survival anyways.",1346544000,2,942,5.190789473684211
3174851,4,B0017PFN18,"Rome is a typical history channel presentation, it is largely well researched and documented and presented in a way that is easy to understand for almost any age, while being entertaining enough to watch completely.

Although very education without a lecturing format as it takes the viewer from the early days of the bare hills on the Tiber to the rise of the empire and its dealings with ""barbarian"" hordes to its ultimate demise it has a tendency to focus too deeply on the battles.

As the focus tends to drift from battle to battle and decapitated head being held aloft to decapitated head being held aloft (I think there was one such scene, at least, in every DVD in the set) - there is less of a focus on Rome ""the civilization"" than I personally would have liked to see.

The series primarily builds on the conquests and wars of Rome, her military strengths and weaknesses, her conquests and ultimate defeat. It does not focus upon her engineering marvels, her architectural accomplishments, her industry or her innovation to anything like the same extent.

The DVD collection has a great deal of repetitiveness, when the broadcast series stopped for a commercial although the commercials are cut out they left in the recap of events immediately prior to the now dead commercial break which sadly can leave the viewer asking why the documentary goes into a persistant ""repeat loop"" every ten minutes.

In the end, for a brief overview of ""Rome, the Empire"" it's probably hard to beat as an entertaining and educational series, but it wouldn't have taken an awful lot of foresight to lift it from ""decent"" to ""extremely good"".",1309996800,2,1633,4.797153024911032

Horrible acting, inaccurate costuming and recreations, inaccurate and sensationalist information, and horribly reptitive and laughable scenes of ""barbarians"" carrying off local village women over their shoulder (I kid you not).

Most of the inaccuracies have been detailed by previous reviewers.  In a nutshell, here is what you will see through this series.

1.  The same 4-5 poorly acted action scenes shown again and again and again.
2.  Repetitve footage of foreign ""actors"" preening in front of mirrors in Greek (not Roman) curraises
3.  Legionaires inaccurately dressed in scarlet (the Roman royal ""purple"" only worn by the imperator).
4.  Legions that run into melee battle scenes hacking and swinging their swords over their heads--no different than their barbarian opponents;
5.  Loincloth clad, dirty grunting ""barbarians"" raping village and pillaging the women (yes, in that order)
6.  Every Hollywood sterotype, cliche, and popular misconception ever told about the Roman Empire all condensed into a single series.

In the end, this series was laughable.  I cannot believe the history channel put their name on such garbage.",1300147200,14,1209,5.372340425531915
3174855,3,B0017PFN18,"I just wanted to add a few things to Agustin Guerroro's very good three-star review that now has the top billing amongst the reviews.

The screen time is divided into three kinds of footage: talking heads (American white guy professors), a map of Europe that shows the expansion and contraction of the empire, with arrows for army movements and, finally, reenactment scenes. The talking heads all have a pleasant screen presence, but if they ever disagree with each other, we don't see it. This is a pity, as Roman history does have its controversies, especially over its limited sources (e.g., what can you really conclude if the only surviving description of a battle comes from a hundred years after the fact?). Likewise, it would have rounded out the program if the talking heads had been supplemented with archaeological findings or if they had computer recreations of, say, Roman artillery.

The driving forces in this series are military leadership and ethnic tensions, with a dash financial difficulties (never really spelled out) and Christianity tossed into the mix. This could work, in a limited fashion, but the weight is really given to individual personalities and they tended to be portrayed in Manichean terms: certain historical figures are seen as either being good for Rome or greedy, power hungry, corrupt, etc. This starts to get as repetitious as the battle scenes, which pretty much all show the same things over and over again: charges on foot, melees and peasants minding their own business and then screaming and running from barbarians. (And except for the very end, the barbarians really do look all alike: there's this one damn late medieval sword that appears in almost every battle.)

I watched the first three episodes in a day but by the end of the second disc (the halfway point), I had slowed down remarkably, sometimes not even completing an episode in a sitting. At first, the show gives this sense of, ""Wow! This is rather lavish."" By the end, it's more like, ""Hey, this legion has the same flag [""LEGXX""] as every other legion in Roman history.""

As Guerroro notes, culture is almost entirely missing from this series (as are women). This is ironic because at the very end of the last episode, the talking heads give justifications for studying Roman history and they're very largely in terms of the influence of Roman culture. (But they forget to mention a big reason for studying the Romans: it's fun!)

Ultimately, I'd say that the series is at the junior high or high school level -- something for a teenager to dribble out over many weeks or months as they go on an Antiquity kick. Otherwise, I'm not sure it's worth the investment in time.

And one final note: just as the battle scenes are short of extras, the `extras' (plural, so-called) of the series are in only one in number, a 43-minute program on barbarian weapons (Celtic chariot, Hun composite bow, Frankish throwing axe, etc.). It has higher production values than the Roman series but is a little maddening in how rapidly the camera keeps cutting to new shots.",1298419200,3,3067,4.865900383141763

3174859,4,B0017PFN18,"Pretty entertaining stuff but it mostly covers the slow demise of the Empire. It does have it's faults though.

The Romans never seem to win a battle. The gear packed by the Romans and barbarians is the same throughout the series. The only time the Romans change gear is when they are fighting each other. One side won't have shields or chain mail. The other side will. More like gladiator fights. They only show one legion no matter where they are. You get a glimpse of a Leg III banner once but otherwise it's all Leg XX. The battles are way too small. Armies supposedly in the thousands will have about 30 guys each. And the narrator is boring.

Still, it tells the story of what went wrong in the Roman empire and how it could have had it all and still failed. The scenes are not as repetitive as Rome Power and Glory. Each episode is entertaining. The fight stunts are pretty well done and give a fair idea of how nasty these battles were, though they didn't show any tactics. Just brawls. And it's huge, over 10 hours long.

Overall it's a good series to have in one's Roman collection.",1280448000,4,1092,4.396039603960396
3174860,2,B0017PFN18,"I, like other reviewers, wondered what the point was in yet another series on Roman history, when there have been recent excellent approaches - the BBC's similarly titled Ancient Rome docudramas (with well-known British actors as various emperors) and HBO's riveting Rome for example. Well, having watched this disappointing History Channel effort, very little. As a well-read female with more than a little knowledge of ancient history, I grew very weary of the constant battle scenes. Even I know that the Roman army changed its garb and tactics over several hundred years, yet the armour and helmets are virtually identical over this period in the re-enactments. The series was apparently filmed on a tight budget somewhere in the Baltic, so we get nondescript actors playing various historical figures. Unfortunately we also get generic barbarians - whether they be Celtic or Germanic tribes, its hard to tell them apart and the same footage is often re-used. Likewise, the same 'village' backgrounds are used - so we get what look like Germanic 'rectangular' houses in Celtic Britain where they surely inhabited the famous roundhouses. The so called expert talking heads are from very obscure American universities. Sure, there are voiceover quotes from various classical writers, but there is no archaeological or other true documentary background. So, to sum up, if you like lots of swords and sandals action, enjoy it, but don't expect a serious documentary. The re-enactment approach can sometimes be successful, but not here.",1276300800,10,1535,5.295081967213115
3174861,4,B0017PFN18,"This DVD set is a thousand times better than the HBO Rome XXX version. This video set focuses on the Roman history we rarely see any information about. The focus of this set is the Roman interaction with the Germanic wars, Britannia, Dracons and other barbarian tribes and territories. This set is centered on the campaigns & battles with the barbarian tribes and little known Roman emperors... so if you are wanting to focus on the flashy figures of Roman history such as Nero or Caligula or Octavian or Cleopatra... this is not the set to buy. It does have Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius, but only those events of their lives which were associated with the barbarian tribes.

This is not about the romanticized parts of roman history we usually see as the focus of most ancient Rome historical documentaries. The Germanic wars are usually the part of Roman history the other documentaries usually omit. So on that aspect, it was quite refreshing to see this rarely covered portion of Roman history.

If you are interested in the rarely covered barbarian wars and campaigns... then this is the set for you. These barbarian campaigns and battles are what eventually broke the back of the Roman Empire. It is not the actual battles which are important... rather the cause of the battles which were the issues.

Your family can watch this series. This set is not filled with p0rn like the HBO Rome XXX soap opera. (Stay away from the HBO Rome set if you have kids. The HBO version is truly full nudity, full action, triple X sex throughout the entire series with no historical merit).

This History channel documentary series is well presented with their usual quality of information and visual recreation of the events, stories, costumes and locations as they provide narration and historical details (although there were a few too many severed heads used in the video). This series also covers a lot of information on several plagues and mass starvations which struck Rome that have rarely been mentioned by any other documentary.

However, it does not include any building of temples or engineering designs which you see on other series. This video has a completely different focus than other documentaries. But, there is a Modern Marvel's episode of ""Barbarian Battle Tech"" included as a bonus feature with this set.

This video covers little known or rarely mentioned Roman emperors and the regions which started to break away from Rome. Decius, Aurelian, Phillip, Constantine and many, many more are included in this series. Rarely seen information on leaders like Queen Zenobia has been brought to life in their historical roles.

There is one core issue which kept setting off the barbarians against the Romans. Every time the Romans bartered a deal with the barbarians, promising land or money or other truces... time after time, from one emperor to the next, the Romans consistently failed to follow through on their promises. The integrity of someone's word or promises was the most important issue for the barbarians. When the barbarians held up their end of the bargain and the Romans did not, this would set off the barbarians into a murderous, unrelenting rage of vengeance against the Romans. The Romans never learned. For over 300 years, they kept making deals with the barbarians and then failed to hold up their end of the bargain... thus, these barbarians, who had no tolerance for liars and had nothing to lose... just continued to beat the crap out of the Romans. Thus, ""those who fail to learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them.""

It is incredible that this same deception kept occurring hundreds of times and yet the Romans never once learned from their mistakes that they should have followed through on their commitments or promises with the barbarians. If the Romans had learned that one simple rule of the importance of integrity, keeping their word and making good on their promises, Rome might have been an active empire today.

Something else which never ceases to amaze me is how these ""experts"" (and film producers) have not yet figured out that the Roman army did not march hundreds of miles wearing full helmets and armor. They only wore those into battle. When they were just moving troops, they stored their gear on wagons which traveled with their regiments. They kept the wagons close enough to each regiment of soldiers where they could quickly retrieve their armor if needed. But anyone who thinks they wore all that armor and helmets, etc., while crossing vast distances... has no common sense at all.

One thing this video reminds us, is that our northern European ancestors were barbaric tribes still living in grass huts and caves 13,000 years after Egypt was building pyramids and 600 years after Rome became a world power. To the Romans, our northern European tribes were as primitive as native jungle tribes are to us today. When you consider the US has only been a country for 234 years and still had native tribes just 134 years ago, it brings a little clarity & humility as to our real position on the global historical food chain.

However, there are some negatives with this video set (directed at the producers and director). Despite the PhD's, Chairs, or books of Thomas R Martin, his speech is so grossly overly exaggerated, he nearly gags himself while speaking. Just the simple word ""food"" nearly has him strangling on his tongue while talking. He gargles every word which drops his perceived IQ level by 50 points per word. It honestly reminds me of some of the guttural noises Jim Carey makes on some of his comedies. Remember how Jim Carey and Morgan Freeman said, ""It's gooood"" in an exaggerated way on ""Bruce Almighty?"" That's the way this guy talks on this video. He nearly gags on the words with ""oo"" or ""ew"" sounds. This isn't a simple case of having an accent. We have strong southern accents where I live as well. This guy has a serious issue with his speech habits which are from sheer habitual laziness not an impediment. I just doubt anyone has had the nerve to tell him so. I'm sure his peers roll their eyes behind his back since he sounds and acts like a half-wit. People tend to judge by someone's actions and not their resume. I bring this up because it is an issue concerning the presentation quality of this video documentary. His input on this video was quite laughable and annoying whenever he appeared on the video because of his extremely exaggerated speech quirks.

Perhaps they will take note of this the next time they hire a commentator for one of their documentaries. When I buy a video documentary, I'm interested in unbiased historical information presented in a professional manner without any gross distractions such as this. It is unfortunate that the History Channel chose him as one of their consultants. When someone sounds as absurd as this guy does, it is so distracting you don't hear a word he says. Even some of his students claimed he is unorganized... while others commented that he was funny and kept them awake (no doubt, after hearing him sound like a clown on the video, I'm sure he's a laugh a minute but it isn't funny on a documentary.)

I think the producers should have selected someone with a better video presence than this guy. A video isn't just about level of credentials or knowledge. That might be ok on written media, but on a video, it also has to include on-air presence, quality and credibility of presentation.

Then there is the issue that anytime a video documentary production selects a consultant from a theological college to be a commentator, it is going to constrain the information they provide. A professor or employee would have to limit their comments within the confines of the policies and beliefs of that institution, no matter what the denomination. This isn't a disparagement. It is a fact. Each private institution has their own specific beliefs and their employees are understandably not going to speak outside of the confines of those policies or make negative statements about their particular denomination. They would be unemployed the next day... just the same as if I went on TV and made disparaging remarks about my employer. It is the same with any corporation or institution. You can't expect someone to make negative comments concerning the policies of their employer as a commentator on a documentary. It makes no sense to put someone in that position in the first place. It doesn't matter what the denomination. It is just common sense. But when dealing with historical issues on a documentary, there are going to be negatives in the development of any civilization or religion. A documentary has to be unbiased to provide historic facts about these events which are not driven from any particular theological viewpoint.

It was also a bit much to hear some of these commentators use modern terms like WMD or National security or 911 to make references to ancient Rome. These modern phrases and terms meant absolutely nothing to ancient civilizations. So to use them, it gives younger viewers the misinterpretation that this was how ancient civilizations conducted their politics. There is an educational responsibility which producers of documentaries need to remember to ensure that the documentaries are unbiased, professional productions, historically accurate and presented in the context appropriate to that time frame... and use a little common sense. Not all of these ""experts"" have any common sense. Perhaps if the history channel selected more mature experts with 25-30 years of experience in their fields (and prescreened their on-air narration skills), it might reduce the amount of immature, silly comments on their programs. I know I also got tired of hearing the term ""Usurper"" every 5 minutes throughout the entire set of video's. It gets very monotonous to hear the same word repeated throughout the video hundreds of times. It seems that someone needs to buy the narrative scriptwriter a copy of Roget's Thesaurus. The production crew also needs to make sure that everyone knows how to properly pronounce names and words used in any video. This is one of the basic concepts that these inexperienced video crews don't seem to have grasped.

Aside from the issues with the production, the basic information and presentation (other than the one commentator) was quite refreshing. All of the historic information was fresh and unique from other videos on Rome and presented with full recreation of events. I was also quite pleased to hear about the Roman emperors who are rarely, if ever, mentioned on any video. This is just a 4 disk set with about 12 episodes and one bonus program... but very informative.",1270512000,,10697,4.89514348785872
3174862,2,B0017PFN18,"Like Mr. Sasso's review, this was a rather incomplete history of Rome.  It focuses almost entirely on the military conquests of the generals and emperors, leaving much to be desired about the cultural, religious, and societal changes.  How do you go through a history of Rome and essentially skip over Nero?  How do you discuss Domitian and merely mention his claim of deity?  These were two brutal emperors that significantly changed the societal landscape and had much blood on their hands besides military campaigns.

It is unfortunate so much of our history is focused on the sensational and incomplete picture.  It is a symptom of our current educational structure, IMO.  While the military campaigns were obviously a crucial characteristic of the time we should not neglect the other elements of culture.  Our system of education since the 1920's has separated the ""types"" of history (military, political, religious, etc.), often diminishing one or more of these characteristics when each plays a vital role in the whole character of history.  Hence, we do not actually learn why events happened.  Not to mention the same ""village"" was attacked in the video about half a dozen times, it got rather tedious and farcical to watch.  This is where, once again, the History Channel seems to fall well short.",1265587200,16,1308,5.065420560747664
3174863,1,B0017PFN18,"I teach history at the local college to adults and I was excited to get some new material for the Roman Empire period.  I was stunned at how shallow and repetitive the material was and the raved about battle scenes were childish in their inacuracy.  They show just how the Romans did NOT fight.  Even with a moderately small cast the way the hasta and the short sword were used in formation could have been shown.  To make it worse the same tired old barbarians in the same tired old helmets and the same tired old LEG XX banner were paraded out each time.  If they had spent less time on repetitive battle scenes and more on real personalities and history we would all have benefitted.  I suggest History Channel study Schama's History of Britain carefully for how history can be presented.  It is crisp, accurate, non repetitive, engaging, frequently humerous and completely up to date scholarship.  The Rome series was built for entertaining viewers who enjoyed a little skirmish scene, over and over and over, not for historians seeking latest knowlege and information about the story. The episode about the invasion and later exit of Britain was useless and the final concluding words dismissed the whole Roman period in Britain as insignificant and they completely missed how it ended when the legions left.  All in all this set was a total waste of my family's money who gave it as a present and a huge let down for me. I found nothing useful in it.

 There were another series in 2006 under the same title which also splited in various episodes about the roman empire and ended in the same way by saying that in 476 the empire ended in the west.
 In these 2006 series actors could talk in the episodes. This new 2008 series have actors but u hear only narrators talking.
 Never the less are very informative series with episodes which cover untold before stories of gaius marius against the barbarians in 110 BC, of the slaughter of three roman legions in 9 AD, of the lives of the emperors decius (249-251) and aurelius (270-275) and of the generals stilicko (in power from 395-408), ricimer (455-472), aegidius (455-465), majorian (emperor from 457-461) and finally of the events which happened in 476 of the deposition of romulus by odovacar in the 4rth of september in 476 BUT as i said before romulus was not the last roman emperor cause in the east zeno was emperor in new rome spoke latin and he and his successors were still recognized roman emperors by the western elites who minted coins bearing the emperors' names until 800 AD when charlemagne was crowned a new western roman emperor successor NOT to romulus but to the latest eastern emperor constantine VI (780-797). The real last western roman emperor was charles the fat who was deposed in 887 AD in the west and in the east the last emperor was constantine XI Palaiologus who was killed in 1453 AD.
 There is proof of what i'm saying even in these 2008 series i'm writing my review now as in the end they admited odovacar sent the imperial insigmia of romulus to zeno the eastern emperor thus acknowledging him as a sole roman emperor and even if this action meant the failure of the west it also meant that NOW IN 476 AD THE EMPIRE WAS UNITED AGAIN UNDER THE SOVEREIGHNITY OF THE EMPEROR REIGHNING IN NEW ROME AS IT WAS 150 YEARS AGO UNDER THE REIGN OF THE FIRST CONSTANTINE (324-337) AND 100 YEARS AGO UNDER THE REIGN OF THE GREAT THEODOSIUS (379-395).

""Rome.  From a small republic, it grows into the greatest empire ever known, lasting for over six-hundred years.  At its height, it stretches from London to Baghdad, projecting its power with the first professional army and creating the model of western civilization.  And yet, when the Empire begins to falter, it collapses with shocking speed.  It takes only a hundred years for the imperial edifice of Rome to vanish like smoke, swept away by the barbarian invasions.  How did it happen?...""

This is how this epic, very informative documentary begins.

The most impressive feature of the DVD set (at least for me) were the re-enactments of battle scenes.  Mostly battle scenes are re-enacted but you will see other things such as politics, religion, military, slavery, assassinations, beheadings, etc. re-enacted.  Note that the narrator and other commentators talk over the action as it proceeds.

The titles of each episode are as follows:

(1) The first barbarian war
(2) Spartacus
(3) Julius Caesar
(4) The forest of death
(5) The invasion of Britain
(6) The Dacian wars
(7) Rebellion and betrayal
(8) Wrath of the Gods
(9) The soldiers' emperor
(10) Constantine the Great
(11) The barbarian general
(12) The puppet master
(13) The last emperor

Each episode has the same main narrator and interspersed in his narration are brief comments from university professors.  (The universities these professors are from include the University of Michigan, University of Tennessee,  University of Ottawa, University of Chicago, and University of Florida.)  Also interspersed with the narration, and I found this most impressive, are actual comments from ancient writers such as historical biographers, emperors, etc.

Each episode has the same format.  All episodes consist of six scenes.  The first scene is always a brief introduction.  The introduction is a transitional link between the previous episode and the new episode.  Each episode ends with a brief overview of what the next episode is about.

Here are the scene titles for the ""Julius Caesar"" episode (#3 above):

(1) Introduction
(2) A natural politician
(3) Leading the legions
(4) More conquests
(5) Enemies gain strength
(6) Bloody betrayal

I must say I learned a lot from this series. I was also impressed with the fact that the narrator did not attempt to saturate the viewer with too much information (I'm sure much more information could have been given) but only relevant information was given.

Finally, this DVD set (released in 2008) was perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one interesting extra.

In conclusion, for those who want to know the essential facts behind the rise and fall of the Roman empire (without resorting to musty, historical textbooks), this is the DVD set to get!!  I leave you with this documentary's last narrated lines:

""From Democracy to Empire to its fall, Rome has inspired the Western World as we know it.  Its civilization survived centuries of war, persecution, corruption, and plague, only to die quietly, slowly, at the hands of one barbarian soldier.""

Perhaps they could follow these 4 DVD's up with more on the topics of... say... the lives of Nero and Commodus, the Roman-Jewish Wars, and the Year of the Four Emperors; perhaps touch on how Pompey entered into the Holy of Holies in the Jewish Temple and expand more on the First Triumvate and their exploits.",1237161600,,455,4.469879518072289
3409281,3,B0017PFN18,"It is commendable to try to explain the rise and fall of the Roman Empire in a few hours of video time while at the same time trying to be entertaining.  There are many possitive aspects of this product:

1.- It covers the lives of many interesting characters, I especially enjoyed the chapters devoted to Marius and the rise of the Empire (his army reforms professionalized the roman army while his use of the army in a clientelar form was imitated by later demagogues and tyrants ultimately overthrew the republican system and in turn created the imperial system which was a quasy military dictatorship), Aurelian who had to fight during his whole life to keep the empire from splintering and sinking, and of Stilicho who gave the western empire a few more decades of life against the threat of the gothic and german invasions.  These historical figures are not usually covered in popular histories of Rome and it was refreshing to see a documentary that addresses them while the lifes of other characters such as Caesar or Augustus have been covered thoroughly in literature and film.

2.- It is not boring , it provided a measure of entertainment maybe because the subject covered is mostly military, many action sequences are readily provided.

3.- It gives some insights from the academics that are interviewed in the show that try to give you some perspective in what you are watching.

To balance this out it has some very bad aspects to this:

1.-  It does not convey well the passage of time, for example the roman legionaires are portrayed during the whole 600 years that the show encompasses as imperial legionaries of the 1st to 2nd century with the use of the lorica segmentata and imperial helmets.  It never addresses the changes of tactics, equipment, dress and the racial composition of the army that took place during all these centuries starting with a full citizen corps in republican times armed with pilum, gladius and covered with mail shirt and coolus helmet of republican times to the army of the late empire composed mainly of gothic and germanic soldiers using equipment such as long swords (spatha), round shields with the chi-rho simbols of the christian legions.  They never talk about the changing of tactics from close order of the republican legion to a more open and flexible imperial legion to the preponderance of the cavalry and the mobile army of the late empire.  This is sad since this is supposed to be a military history documentary of the history channel.

2.- It explains everything in terms of military  prowess and generalship.  Good military leaders Rome expands and gains ascendancy over its enemies when leaders are weaker Rome suffers setbacks.  It never addresses the economic and cultural changes that ultimately were the cause of the fall of the western empire.  The empire went bankrupt with the need to keep a huge standing army and this created one of the reasons for the collapse.  The reason for the ascendancy of a military power stems from its internal wellfare the better developed and rich the society is the better warriors and leaders it produces.

3.-  Religion and culture are almost left behind, we hear about the impact of christianity more because of the persecution of christians than any impact this religion made on the culture and moral fiber of the roman society, the documentary falis to explain how things worked in Roman society and almost makes us believe that the only worthwhile pursuit in the empire was soldiering.  Rome was strong becuase it created and exported an strong culture, it not only conquered militarily but also subjugated by romanizing its foes.

4.-  The battle scenes are repetitive foes and romans always look the same and it feels that there are not enough extras and the battles seem small affairs.  This aspect betrays budget problems.

Overall you have a mediocre product that does not live up to its expectations.",1233705600,113,3918,4.88368580060423

Also, this series starts halfway through Roman history instead at its origins.  It also doesn't tell the general story of Rome as it moved over time, we have to infer it from numerous little stories about very specific events or concepts.

This isn't a bad documentary set, it's o.k.  But It greatly pales in comparison to the Rome: Power & Glory documentary set, so if you want to just buy one series on Rome, I would recommend the other documentary set instead.  Lots of good stuff to learn in here though, and if you want a lot of details about specific events than get this.  If you just want to learn about what Rome was and how it came about and fell apart, watch Rome: Power & Glory instead, it does that much more clearly and in half the viewing time (and half the cost).",1399075200,2,936,4.350574712643678
3409327,5,B0017PFN18,"History Channel's 13-episode ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire"" is fast-moving and insightful, giving an overview of Rome's major military campaigns between the first barbarian war against the Roman Republic in the 2nd century BC and the last emperor in 5th century AD. The series is slick and well-edited, juxtaposing excellent battle recreations with punchy analysis by historical experts. Each episode is 44 minutes long (presumably leaving a lot of time for commercials when the series aired in one-hour slots on TV) and is as action-packed as military history gets. I particularly like how ancient Roman historians (Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch, et al) are continually quoted to describe events.

Unfortunately, the exclusive focus on military exploits leaves the impression that Rome rose and fell on its military might, leaving out most of the political and religious/social factors that played a role in the empire. Rome's contribution to world culture and its system of religious worship is almost entirely neglected. In fact, I was surprised that the first episode launched right into the first barbarian war without any historical context whatsoever, as I had believed a series on the history of Rome would begin more fittingly with at least a nod to the foundational myths and earliest historical records of the Romans prior to the Republic's formation. In fact, the first episode is rather dull, presenting Rome's early expansion in a way that merely sets up the Roman-Barbarian opposition that this series sees as the sole fact in Rome's success and ultimate collapse.

All the same, some of the episodes are truly excellent, particularly ""Spartacus"" (episode two) where we learn quite a bit about the slave revolt's stunning victories and little-known military tactics (i.e. the slaves rappelling off ropes to escape a mountain and the Romans building a defensive wall across southern Italy to trap the slaves) used by both sides. Some later episodes like ""Constantine,"" describing the empire's Christianization, are fun and informative. Likewise, ""Julius Caesar"" (episode three) features an incredibly exciting summary of Caesar's stunning rise to power through the Gallic wars. The Caesar episode is so fixated on the Gallic wars that it gives us very little else, merely nodding at Marc Antony's presence in Caesar's army without giving any explanation whatsoever for Augustus succeeding Caesar (the entire fight for succession between Antony, Brutus, Octavian, et al is omitted) and becoming the first emperor. One wishes this episode had been drawn out a bit more or continued in the next episode. Still, it's pretty compelling in its overview of Caesar's rise to power.

As the series progresses, one grows increasingly surprised at what is omitted by the producers, particularly the details of succession to the empire's throne. Augustus is almost entirely neglected except for his reactions to failures in the German campaign and Caligula's death is described almost as a footnote. After awhile, the series also becomes repetitive, giving so many battles and maps that one starts to tire of it. Many iconic moments in Roman history are ignored or brushed aside in favor of the war chronicles.

In the final analysis, the series is extremely exciting and fun as a military history, particularly if you take it in episodic chunks at your leisure rather than trying to go through the whole thing in a short time frame. Each episode is a pretty rich feast of historical information compressed into a very brief timeframe, making it ideal for classroom use in a history course or study group. The box set is also one of the History Channel's better packagings, offering the four-disc set in a neat fold-out box that features attractive artwork and one special feature on the last disc (""Barbarian Battle Tech"" documentary) that is fun for military hardware junkies. If you're a guy, you'll love the military history focus of the series, and it's an entertaining companion for any study of Roman history. It's just a bit light on context.",1392508800,3,4055,5.195718654434251

However, if you are a history buff and have not covered the Roman Empire as part of some other films by the History Channel I think you could benefit from owning this DVD.",1390521600,2,519,4.591397849462366

3409331,3,B0017PFN18,"To anyone considering renting or buying this series, I would suggest they first determine what it is they are hoping to get from it, because this production's positives and negatives are highly relevant to the viewer's expectations.  My own were entirely out of place; I was interested in learning the connecting chains of cause and effect that led to the downfall of the Roman Empire, and at the same time hoping to shore up my knowledge of the figures from its latter years.  With a subtitle of RISE AND FALL OF AN EMPIRE, I don't think those expectations were unreasonable, though I had a feeling, based on previous experience with the History Channel, that they might be hard to meet.

There are several one and two star reviews that detail the technical mistakes of this series - such as improper equipment during some scenes - and that also take it to task for what they believe to be glaring omissions, slip-shod analysis, and even some factual errors.  I would encourage potential viewers with exacting demands to take a look at those reviews, because I'm confident those problems do exist - I'm just not expert enough to pick them all out and list them.  Again: You have to know what it is you are looking for in this series.  To me, many of the problems with the reenactment scenes are just not that important because to my mind, they exist not to give an exact representation, but as a sort of visual aide to the imagination.  So when I see about thirty 'Roman Legionaries' and thirty 'barbarians' standing in for tens of thousands, who then go on to mix it up in the same stretch of woods that every other 'battle' takes place in, I'm not terrifically upset.  I can see how it would bother some viewers though, and truthfully, watching these episodes in fairly rapid succession magnifies the problem even to me - if one had watched when first aired, the similarity of setting, the replaying of the same footage for events separated by decades if not centuries, and the paucity of men in battle would be much easier to overlook.  To me, it was an minor irritation.  To others, it might be a deal breaker.

Far worse, in my opinion, was the utter lack of causality in the series.  The subject of each episode seems as though it exists in a vacuum, with little relation to the one previous.  Rather than highlighting events that forced social and structural changes within the empire, it seems that the focus is on the sensational and the superficial.  For instance, by the time one gets to the end of the third disc, one might think that the only difference between the Rome of Julius Caesar's day and that of Constantine was that Christianity had come onto the world stage.  This lack of a chain linking one event to the next also makes it difficult for me to retain the significance of major figures, and even to keep the timeline straight.

As far as the analysis provided, I think it is okay as far as it goes, but it strikes me as oriented toward perhaps a tenth grade level history course.  It's probable that it couldn't be any other way - there simply isn't enough time allotted to cover so much history.  And, with only one exception, enough professors are used so that no one analyst feels overused.

The high point of the series is probably the fact that much history that rarely gets examined receives its due here - and thankfully, not too much (or too little) time is spent on events that have been exhausted elsewhere.  So, no Cleopatra and the asp, no Nero and his fiddle.  Given the other problems this series suffers from, this powers the rating back up to three for myself.  I liked it more than not, though I watched it while walking on a treadmill, and my thankfulness for the diversion may have affected my opinion.  Plus, I feel more enlightened than if I had watched a Family Guy marathon.  Rent first if you're interested.",1388620800,2,3857,4.5726744186046515

3409335,1,B0017PFN18,"This series consists mostly of badly re-enacted battle scenes or even weaker attempts at Roman street scenes.  (One gladiatorial fight, with the triumvirate of Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus present, is depicted in what looks like an arena for training ponies; the shouting crowd consists of maybe a hundred people.  It's absurd.)  A great deal of what is shown is inapt or inept.  Every battle occurs in the same landscape, one that never looks anything like the place in  which it is supposed to be taking place.  Vast numbers of legionnaires are represented by a handful of men.  The actors mostly remain unchanged through time, rarely look appropriate for their roles (the man who plays Brutus is particularly wrong for his part), and seem completely uncomfortable in their costumes.  The man who portrays Spartacus is shown as if he were a porn star.  The episodes make huge leaps in time with very little connection made between the eras.  Almost no attention is paid to Roman cultural, social, or intellectual life, no matter the period.  Much of the music is not only bad; it is so overbearing that it is difficult to hear the narration.  Because the series was made for TV with ads, there is endless repetition, supposedly joins between sections that had been interrupted by commercials.  There was no re-editing after the ads were deleted.  The commentators are fair, but what they have to say for each episode might be reduced to a paragraph or two.  Someone utterly ignorant of Roman history might learn a thing or two from listening to them, but no one else.  For the most part, what they have to say is at best superficial and far more quickly to be found elsewhere.  One wonders why a few of them become so animated when speaking since what they have to say holds so little interest.  This is history viewed on the cheap, much of it silly, none of it profound or genuinely provocative, a comic book version of the real thing.  Don't waste your time on it.",1380585600,6,1967,4.715542521994135

After looking through all of the available Rome documentary's to pick from I finally decided to choose this documentary made by the History Channel. History Channel always makes good, accurate, and interesting documentary's but I was still skeptical and unsure if this was going to be a good documentary. In the end I decided to take a chance and was not disappointed at all. ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire""  is extremely well done and covers a wide variety of people and events during the 600 years that Rome ruled.

1. The documentary covers multiple Roman Emperors (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, etc.)

2. The documentary covers multiple Roman Generals (Gaius Marius, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Julius Caesar, Avidius Cassius, etc.)

3. Covers multiple Roman conquests or attempted conquests (Britannia, Germania, Gaul, Macedonia, etc.)

Overall this was an amazing documentary, every episode you learn a great deal about Rome and the leaders who led it throughout the centuries. The documentary is not boring at all, keeps you interested all the way through each episode, and teaches you nearly everything you want to know about the Roman Empire.

3409341,4,B0017PFN18,"This 13-part series, originally aired on the History channel, is a documentary covering Rome's ascent into an empire, starting in the second century BC, and its eventual collapse in the late 400s.  As with many documentaries, it is a blend of interviews with historians, live action sequences with actors playing Roman statesman, and extras recreating battles.  The main strength of this series is that it captures both many significant events and the larger sweep of history.  Inevitably, some events are omitted.  The Punic Wars, in which Rome defeated Carthage and gained control of the Western Mediterranean, are not mentioned.  Instead, the series begins with Rome's northern campaigns in the next century.  Similarly, the campaign against the Huns, in which Roman and Visigothic forces turned back the Asiatic invasion in 451, is brushed over.  The series devotes more time to political intrigues and civil strife than to other causes of Rome's decline.  There were other causes, which were arguably more important: a series of epidemics depopulated the empire just as population pressure was driving the barbarian invaders westward.  Despite this, the series is basically successful.  Watching it, one gets a sense of high drama playing out over a span of several centuries.",1363651200,4,1281,5.3283582089552235

3409348,4,B0017PFN18,"Rome is a typical history channel presentation, it is largely well researched and documented and presented in a way that is easy to understand for almost any age, while being entertaining enough to watch completely.

Although very education without a lecturing format as it takes the viewer from the early days of the bare hills on the Tiber to the rise of the empire and its dealings with ""barbarian"" hordes to its ultimate demise it has a tendency to focus too deeply on the battles.

As the focus tends to drift from battle to battle and decapitated head being held aloft to decapitated head being held aloft (I think there was one such scene, at least, in every DVD in the set) - there is less of a focus on Rome ""the civilization"" than I personally would have liked to see.

The series primarily builds on the conquests and wars of Rome, her military strengths and weaknesses, her conquests and ultimate defeat. It does not focus upon her engineering marvels, her architectural accomplishments, her industry or her innovation to anything like the same extent.

The DVD collection has a great deal of repetitiveness, when the broadcast series stopped for a commercial although the commercials are cut out they left in the recap of events immediately prior to the now dead commercial break which sadly can leave the viewer asking why the documentary goes into a persistant ""repeat loop"" every ten minutes.

In the end, for a brief overview of ""Rome, the Empire"" it's probably hard to beat as an entertaining and educational series, but it wouldn't have taken an awful lot of foresight to lift it from ""decent"" to ""extremely good"".",1309996800,2,1633,4.797153024911032

Horrible acting, inaccurate costuming and recreations, inaccurate and sensationalist information, and horribly reptitive and laughable scenes of ""barbarians"" carrying off local village women over their shoulder (I kid you not).

Most of the inaccuracies have been detailed by previous reviewers.  In a nutshell, here is what you will see through this series.

1.  The same 4-5 poorly acted action scenes shown again and again and again.
2.  Repetitve footage of foreign ""actors"" preening in front of mirrors in Greek (not Roman) curraises
3.  Legionaires inaccurately dressed in scarlet (the Roman royal ""purple"" only worn by the imperator).
4.  Legions that run into melee battle scenes hacking and swinging their swords over their heads--no different than their barbarian opponents;
5.  Loincloth clad, dirty grunting ""barbarians"" raping village and pillaging the women (yes, in that order)
6.  Every Hollywood sterotype, cliche, and popular misconception ever told about the Roman Empire all condensed into a single series.

In the end, this series was laughable.  I cannot believe the history channel put their name on such garbage.",1300147200,14,1209,5.372340425531915
3409352,3,B0017PFN18,"I just wanted to add a few things to Agustin Guerroro's very good three-star review that now has the top billing amongst the reviews.

The screen time is divided into three kinds of footage: talking heads (American white guy professors), a map of Europe that shows the expansion and contraction of the empire, with arrows for army movements and, finally, reenactment scenes. The talking heads all have a pleasant screen presence, but if they ever disagree with each other, we don't see it. This is a pity, as Roman history does have its controversies, especially over its limited sources (e.g., what can you really conclude if the only surviving description of a battle comes from a hundred years after the fact?). Likewise, it would have rounded out the program if the talking heads had been supplemented with archaeological findings or if they had computer recreations of, say, Roman artillery.

The driving forces in this series are military leadership and ethnic tensions, with a dash financial difficulties (never really spelled out) and Christianity tossed into the mix. This could work, in a limited fashion, but the weight is really given to individual personalities and they tended to be portrayed in Manichean terms: certain historical figures are seen as either being good for Rome or greedy, power hungry, corrupt, etc. This starts to get as repetitious as the battle scenes, which pretty much all show the same things over and over again: charges on foot, melees and peasants minding their own business and then screaming and running from barbarians. (And except for the very end, the barbarians really do look all alike: there's this one damn late medieval sword that appears in almost every battle.)

I watched the first three episodes in a day but by the end of the second disc (the halfway point), I had slowed down remarkably, sometimes not even completing an episode in a sitting. At first, the show gives this sense of, ""Wow! This is rather lavish."" By the end, it's more like, ""Hey, this legion has the same flag [""LEGXX""] as every other legion in Roman history.""

As Guerroro notes, culture is almost entirely missing from this series (as are women). This is ironic because at the very end of the last episode, the talking heads give justifications for studying Roman history and they're very largely in terms of the influence of Roman culture. (But they forget to mention a big reason for studying the Romans: it's fun!)

Ultimately, I'd say that the series is at the junior high or high school level -- something for a teenager to dribble out over many weeks or months as they go on an Antiquity kick. Otherwise, I'm not sure it's worth the investment in time.

And one final note: just as the battle scenes are short of extras, the `extras' (plural, so-called) of the series are in only one in number, a 43-minute program on barbarian weapons (Celtic chariot, Hun composite bow, Frankish throwing axe, etc.). It has higher production values than the Roman series but is a little maddening in how rapidly the camera keeps cutting to new shots.",1298419200,3,3067,4.865900383141763

There are a few flaws.  Some of the historical recreations are a bit inaccurate.  For example, no matter what the time period plate armour is used by the Roman soldiers.  Plate armor wasn't used by Romans until the first century AD. Some of the analogies with modern day events is a bit shaky.

3409356,4,B0017PFN18,"Pretty entertaining stuff but it mostly covers the slow demise of the Empire. It does have it's faults though.

The Romans never seem to win a battle. The gear packed by the Romans and barbarians is the same throughout the series. The only time the Romans change gear is when they are fighting each other. One side won't have shields or chain mail. The other side will. More like gladiator fights. They only show one legion no matter where they are. You get a glimpse of a Leg III banner once but otherwise it's all Leg XX. The battles are way too small. Armies supposedly in the thousands will have about 30 guys each. And the narrator is boring.

Still, it tells the story of what went wrong in the Roman empire and how it could have had it all and still failed. The scenes are not as repetitive as Rome Power and Glory. Each episode is entertaining. The fight stunts are pretty well done and give a fair idea of how nasty these battles were, though they didn't show any tactics. Just brawls. And it's huge, over 10 hours long.

Overall it's a good series to have in one's Roman collection.",1280448000,4,1092,4.396039603960396
3409357,2,B0017PFN18,"I, like other reviewers, wondered what the point was in yet another series on Roman history, when there have been recent excellent approaches - the BBC's similarly titled Ancient Rome docudramas (with well-known British actors as various emperors) and HBO's riveting Rome for example. Well, having watched this disappointing History Channel effort, very little. As a well-read female with more than a little knowledge of ancient history, I grew very weary of the constant battle scenes. Even I know that the Roman army changed its garb and tactics over several hundred years, yet the armour and helmets are virtually identical over this period in the re-enactments. The series was apparently filmed on a tight budget somewhere in the Baltic, so we get nondescript actors playing various historical figures. Unfortunately we also get generic barbarians - whether they be Celtic or Germanic tribes, its hard to tell them apart and the same footage is often re-used. Likewise, the same 'village' backgrounds are used - so we get what look like Germanic 'rectangular' houses in Celtic Britain where they surely inhabited the famous roundhouses. The so called expert talking heads are from very obscure American universities. Sure, there are voiceover quotes from various classical writers, but there is no archaeological or other true documentary background. So, to sum up, if you like lots of swords and sandals action, enjoy it, but don't expect a serious documentary. The re-enactment approach can sometimes be successful, but not here.",1276300800,10,1535,5.295081967213115
3409358,4,B0017PFN18,"This DVD set is a thousand times better than the HBO Rome XXX version. This video set focuses on the Roman history we rarely see any information about. The focus of this set is the Roman interaction with the Germanic wars, Britannia, Dracons and other barbarian tribes and territories. This set is centered on the campaigns & battles with the barbarian tribes and little known Roman emperors... so if you are wanting to focus on the flashy figures of Roman history such as Nero or Caligula or Octavian or Cleopatra... this is not the set to buy. It does have Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius, but only those events of their lives which were associated with the barbarian tribes.

This is not about the romanticized parts of roman history we usually see as the focus of most ancient Rome historical documentaries. The Germanic wars are usually the part of Roman history the other documentaries usually omit. So on that aspect, it was quite refreshing to see this rarely covered portion of Roman history.

If you are interested in the rarely covered barbarian wars and campaigns... then this is the set for you. These barbarian campaigns and battles are what eventually broke the back of the Roman Empire. It is not the actual battles which are important... rather the cause of the battles which were the issues.

Your family can watch this series. This set is not filled with p0rn like the HBO Rome XXX soap opera. (Stay away from the HBO Rome set if you have kids. The HBO version is truly full nudity, full action, triple X sex throughout the entire series with no historical merit).

This History channel documentary series is well presented with their usual quality of information and visual recreation of the events, stories, costumes and locations as they provide narration and historical details (although there were a few too many severed heads used in the video). This series also covers a lot of information on several plagues and mass starvations which struck Rome that have rarely been mentioned by any other documentary.

However, it does not include any building of temples or engineering designs which you see on other series. This video has a completely different focus than other documentaries. But, there is a Modern Marvel's episode of ""Barbarian Battle Tech"" included as a bonus feature with this set.

This video covers little known or rarely mentioned Roman emperors and the regions which started to break away from Rome. Decius, Aurelian, Phillip, Constantine and many, many more are included in this series. Rarely seen information on leaders like Queen Zenobia has been brought to life in their historical roles.

There is one core issue which kept setting off the barbarians against the Romans. Every time the Romans bartered a deal with the barbarians, promising land or money or other truces... time after time, from one emperor to the next, the Romans consistently failed to follow through on their promises. The integrity of someone's word or promises was the most important issue for the barbarians. When the barbarians held up their end of the bargain and the Romans did not, this would set off the barbarians into a murderous, unrelenting rage of vengeance against the Romans. The Romans never learned. For over 300 years, they kept making deals with the barbarians and then failed to hold up their end of the bargain... thus, these barbarians, who had no tolerance for liars and had nothing to lose... just continued to beat the crap out of the Romans. Thus, ""those who fail to learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them.""

It is incredible that this same deception kept occurring hundreds of times and yet the Romans never once learned from their mistakes that they should have followed through on their commitments or promises with the barbarians. If the Romans had learned that one simple rule of the importance of integrity, keeping their word and making good on their promises, Rome might have been an active empire today.

Something else which never ceases to amaze me is how these ""experts"" (and film producers) have not yet figured out that the Roman army did not march hundreds of miles wearing full helmets and armor. They only wore those into battle. When they were just moving troops, they stored their gear on wagons which traveled with their regiments. They kept the wagons close enough to each regiment of soldiers where they could quickly retrieve their armor if needed. But anyone who thinks they wore all that armor and helmets, etc., while crossing vast distances... has no common sense at all.

One thing this video reminds us, is that our northern European ancestors were barbaric tribes still living in grass huts and caves 13,000 years after Egypt was building pyramids and 600 years after Rome became a world power. To the Romans, our northern European tribes were as primitive as native jungle tribes are to us today. When you consider the US has only been a country for 234 years and still had native tribes just 134 years ago, it brings a little clarity & humility as to our real position on the global historical food chain.

However, there are some negatives with this video set (directed at the producers and director). Despite the PhD's, Chairs, or books of Thomas R Martin, his speech is so grossly overly exaggerated, he nearly gags himself while speaking. Just the simple word ""food"" nearly has him strangling on his tongue while talking. He gargles every word which drops his perceived IQ level by 50 points per word. It honestly reminds me of some of the guttural noises Jim Carey makes on some of his comedies. Remember how Jim Carey and Morgan Freeman said, ""It's gooood"" in an exaggerated way on ""Bruce Almighty?"" That's the way this guy talks on this video. He nearly gags on the words with ""oo"" or ""ew"" sounds. This isn't a simple case of having an accent. We have strong southern accents where I live as well. This guy has a serious issue with his speech habits which are from sheer habitual laziness not an impediment. I just doubt anyone has had the nerve to tell him so. I'm sure his peers roll their eyes behind his back since he sounds and acts like a half-wit. People tend to judge by someone's actions and not their resume. I bring this up because it is an issue concerning the presentation quality of this video documentary. His input on this video was quite laughable and annoying whenever he appeared on the video because of his extremely exaggerated speech quirks.

Perhaps they will take note of this the next time they hire a commentator for one of their documentaries. When I buy a video documentary, I'm interested in unbiased historical information presented in a professional manner without any gross distractions such as this. It is unfortunate that the History Channel chose him as one of their consultants. When someone sounds as absurd as this guy does, it is so distracting you don't hear a word he says. Even some of his students claimed he is unorganized... while others commented that he was funny and kept them awake (no doubt, after hearing him sound like a clown on the video, I'm sure he's a laugh a minute but it isn't funny on a documentary.)

I think the producers should have selected someone with a better video presence than this guy. A video isn't just about level of credentials or knowledge. That might be ok on written media, but on a video, it also has to include on-air presence, quality and credibility of presentation.

Then there is the issue that anytime a video documentary production selects a consultant from a theological college to be a commentator, it is going to constrain the information they provide. A professor or employee would have to limit their comments within the confines of the policies and beliefs of that institution, no matter what the denomination. This isn't a disparagement. It is a fact. Each private institution has their own specific beliefs and their employees are understandably not going to speak outside of the confines of those policies or make negative statements about their particular denomination. They would be unemployed the next day... just the same as if I went on TV and made disparaging remarks about my employer. It is the same with any corporation or institution. You can't expect someone to make negative comments concerning the policies of their employer as a commentator on a documentary. It makes no sense to put someone in that position in the first place. It doesn't matter what the denomination. It is just common sense. But when dealing with historical issues on a documentary, there are going to be negatives in the development of any civilization or religion. A documentary has to be unbiased to provide historic facts about these events which are not driven from any particular theological viewpoint.

It was also a bit much to hear some of these commentators use modern terms like WMD or National security or 911 to make references to ancient Rome. These modern phrases and terms meant absolutely nothing to ancient civilizations. So to use them, it gives younger viewers the misinterpretation that this was how ancient civilizations conducted their politics. There is an educational responsibility which producers of documentaries need to remember to ensure that the documentaries are unbiased, professional productions, historically accurate and presented in the context appropriate to that time frame... and use a little common sense. Not all of these ""experts"" have any common sense. Perhaps if the history channel selected more mature experts with 25-30 years of experience in their fields (and prescreened their on-air narration skills), it might reduce the amount of immature, silly comments on their programs. I know I also got tired of hearing the term ""Usurper"" every 5 minutes throughout the entire set of video's. It gets very monotonous to hear the same word repeated throughout the video hundreds of times. It seems that someone needs to buy the narrative scriptwriter a copy of Roget's Thesaurus. The production crew also needs to make sure that everyone knows how to properly pronounce names and words used in any video. This is one of the basic concepts that these inexperienced video crews don't seem to have grasped.

Aside from the issues with the production, the basic information and presentation (other than the one commentator) was quite refreshing. All of the historic information was fresh and unique from other videos on Rome and presented with full recreation of events. I was also quite pleased to hear about the Roman emperors who are rarely, if ever, mentioned on any video. This is just a 4 disk set with about 12 episodes and one bonus program... but very informative.",1270512000,,10697,4.89514348785872
3409359,2,B0017PFN18,"Like Mr. Sasso's review, this was a rather incomplete history of Rome.  It focuses almost entirely on the military conquests of the generals and emperors, leaving much to be desired about the cultural, religious, and societal changes.  How do you go through a history of Rome and essentially skip over Nero?  How do you discuss Domitian and merely mention his claim of deity?  These were two brutal emperors that significantly changed the societal landscape and had much blood on their hands besides military campaigns.

It is unfortunate so much of our history is focused on the sensational and incomplete picture.  It is a symptom of our current educational structure, IMO.  While the military campaigns were obviously a crucial characteristic of the time we should not neglect the other elements of culture.  Our system of education since the 1920's has separated the ""types"" of history (military, political, religious, etc.), often diminishing one or more of these characteristics when each plays a vital role in the whole character of history.  Hence, we do not actually learn why events happened.  Not to mention the same ""village"" was attacked in the video about half a dozen times, it got rather tedious and farcical to watch.  This is where, once again, the History Channel seems to fall well short.",1265587200,16,1308,5.065420560747664
3409360,1,B0017PFN18,"I teach history at the local college to adults and I was excited to get some new material for the Roman Empire period.  I was stunned at how shallow and repetitive the material was and the raved about battle scenes were childish in their inacuracy.  They show just how the Romans did NOT fight.  Even with a moderately small cast the way the hasta and the short sword were used in formation could have been shown.  To make it worse the same tired old barbarians in the same tired old helmets and the same tired old LEG XX banner were paraded out each time.  If they had spent less time on repetitive battle scenes and more on real personalities and history we would all have benefitted.  I suggest History Channel study Schama's History of Britain carefully for how history can be presented.  It is crisp, accurate, non repetitive, engaging, frequently humerous and completely up to date scholarship.  The Rome series was built for entertaining viewers who enjoyed a little skirmish scene, over and over and over, not for historians seeking latest knowlege and information about the story. The episode about the invasion and later exit of Britain was useless and the final concluding words dismissed the whole Roman period in Britain as insignificant and they completely missed how it ended when the legions left.  All in all this set was a total waste of my family's money who gave it as a present and a huge let down for me. I found nothing useful in it.

 There were another series in 2006 under the same title which also splited in various episodes about the roman empire and ended in the same way by saying that in 476 the empire ended in the west.
 In these 2006 series actors could talk in the episodes. This new 2008 series have actors but u hear only narrators talking.
 Never the less are very informative series with episodes which cover untold before stories of gaius marius against the barbarians in 110 BC, of the slaughter of three roman legions in 9 AD, of the lives of the emperors decius (249-251) and aurelius (270-275) and of the generals stilicko (in power from 395-408), ricimer (455-472), aegidius (455-465), majorian (emperor from 457-461) and finally of the events which happened in 476 of the deposition of romulus by odovacar in the 4rth of september in 476 BUT as i said before romulus was not the last roman emperor cause in the east zeno was emperor in new rome spoke latin and he and his successors were still recognized roman emperors by the western elites who minted coins bearing the emperors' names until 800 AD when charlemagne was crowned a new western roman emperor successor NOT to romulus but to the latest eastern emperor constantine VI (780-797). The real last western roman emperor was charles the fat who was deposed in 887 AD in the west and in the east the last emperor was constantine XI Palaiologus who was killed in 1453 AD.
 There is proof of what i'm saying even in these 2008 series i'm writing my review now as in the end they admited odovacar sent the imperial insigmia of romulus to zeno the eastern emperor thus acknowledging him as a sole roman emperor and even if this action meant the failure of the west it also meant that NOW IN 476 AD THE EMPIRE WAS UNITED AGAIN UNDER THE SOVEREIGHNITY OF THE EMPEROR REIGHNING IN NEW ROME AS IT WAS 150 YEARS AGO UNDER THE REIGN OF THE FIRST CONSTANTINE (324-337) AND 100 YEARS AGO UNDER THE REIGN OF THE GREAT THEODOSIUS (379-395).

""Rome.  From a small republic, it grows into the greatest empire ever known, lasting for over six-hundred years.  At its height, it stretches from London to Baghdad, projecting its power with the first professional army and creating the model of western civilization.  And yet, when the Empire begins to falter, it collapses with shocking speed.  It takes only a hundred years for the imperial edifice of Rome to vanish like smoke, swept away by the barbarian invasions.  How did it happen?...""

This is how this epic, very informative documentary begins.

The most impressive feature of the DVD set (at least for me) were the re-enactments of battle scenes.  Mostly battle scenes are re-enacted but you will see other things such as politics, religion, military, slavery, assassinations, beheadings, etc. re-enacted.  Note that the narrator and other commentators talk over the action as it proceeds.

The titles of each episode are as follows:

(1) The first barbarian war
(2) Spartacus
(3) Julius Caesar
(4) The forest of death
(5) The invasion of Britain
(6) The Dacian wars
(7) Rebellion and betrayal
(8) Wrath of the Gods
(9) The soldiers' emperor
(10) Constantine the Great
(11) The barbarian general
(12) The puppet master
(13) The last emperor

Each episode has the same main narrator and interspersed in his narration are brief comments from university professors.  (The universities these professors are from include the University of Michigan, University of Tennessee,  University of Ottawa, University of Chicago, and University of Florida.)  Also interspersed with the narration, and I found this most impressive, are actual comments from ancient writers such as historical biographers, emperors, etc.

Each episode has the same format.  All episodes consist of six scenes.  The first scene is always a brief introduction.  The introduction is a transitional link between the previous episode and the new episode.  Each episode ends with a brief overview of what the next episode is about.

Here are the scene titles for the ""Julius Caesar"" episode (#3 above):

(1) Introduction
(2) A natural politician
(3) Leading the legions
(4) More conquests
(5) Enemies gain strength
(6) Bloody betrayal

I must say I learned a lot from this series. I was also impressed with the fact that the narrator did not attempt to saturate the viewer with too much information (I'm sure much more information could have been given) but only relevant information was given.

Finally, this DVD set (released in 2008) was perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one interesting extra.

In conclusion, for those who want to know the essential facts behind the rise and fall of the Roman empire (without resorting to musty, historical textbooks), this is the DVD set to get!!  I leave you with this documentary's last narrated lines:

""From Democracy to Empire to its fall, Rome has inspired the Western World as we know it.  Its civilization survived centuries of war, persecution, corruption, and plague, only to die quietly, slowly, at the hands of one barbarian soldier.""

So if you want a general overview of Rome, better to find another documentary first, and THEN hop into this one.

For what it is, I found this series to be well-produced and well put together.  I was impressed how much attention was paid to the Late Roman Empire.  So many of us think of Rome as Julius Ceasar --> Constantine/Constantinople somewhere in there --> Dark Ages.  I enjoyed learning about all the intrigue and battles, Emperors that I have never heard of (Aurelean who?) and the interaction between the eastern and western halves of the empire.  I also didn't realize that Western Rome sort of faded away, and didn't end with a bang at Aloric's single sack of Rome.  The person-centric episodes on Spartacus and Constantine were the best, maybe because they were the most familiar to us.

The format of narration and expert interviews combined with wordless reenactment was well-executed.  And yes, there are some flaws.  It was funny to see 500 years of battles pulled from a week's worth of film footage in the same forest, and the same pretty ladies living in Rome for hundreds of years.  I'm sure that Marcus Aurelius, Aurelean, and Constantine, were all on the same riverbank.  (I do giver them credit for mixing in more and more barbarians into the Roman troops as time went on.) Oh well, I realize these shows are expensive.  It's too bad that the History Channel didn't produce a parallel series on the culture of Rome.  Then people could get a complete picture of the Empire.",1490572800,3,2076,4.8328611898017

8266804,5,B0017PFN18,This series coupled with Rome: Power & Glory are a very wide picture of the Roman Empire. Pretty decent productions for both and very interesting.,1484265600,,146,4.88

There are battle scenes in every episode that make you feel like your watching the same episode over and over again. I love the subject matter, but the editing and directing feel a lazy in my opinion.",1482883200,,356,4.173913043478261
