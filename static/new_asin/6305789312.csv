1069332,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is a TV show running 26 episodes (I believe).  When I first heard of this show, I was skeptical.  I had a very strong preconception of Japanese animation which was blown away by this title.  It defies genre.
Very often we make the mistake of classifying anime in its own  ""section"" when in reality what we consider one thing is actually  several different kinds of stories.  This reminded me of an earlier title,  Cobra, which the anime at least was similar too sans the late 70's, early  80's look.
Cowboy Bebop expemplifies this, providing a unique spin on  Bounty Hunters in space.  The irreverent duo of Spike and Jet and their  motley crew go on several -- successful and not -- ventures.  The story  moves.  It has steam.  I have seen it numerous times and never get bored or  glance at the clock.
This DVD is worth it, if only for the exceptional  fifth episode, which is aboslutely _gorgeous_.  The CGI, which normally  does nothing for me, was tastefull and extremley well-integratred.
The  DVD menu is simple, yet suited to the theme and well designed.  It is very  nice to look at.  The chapters are perfectly broken down several times  between the episode (so you can skip opening and ending songs when watching  it at length, or not as you choose), which is often a problem on other  anime disks that are TV series.
From a technical aspect, it ran perfectly  smooth on my player.  My one complaint is that with english subtitles  turned on, at the end of a few episodes, the songs were subtitled japanese  instead.  I was however, very pleased with the purchase, and intent to get  the rest of the series.",958953600,3,1631,4.574912891986063

1069334,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is full of action, suspense, and humor. It is a great series filled with original characters and plots. You'll never look at anime the same way again after you watch cowboy bebop. If you have never seen anime  before, there is no better way to start. As for anime fans, trigun is  another show very similar to cowboy bebop. You might want to check that out  too.",956188800,2,375,4.405797101449275

1)Add in a dash of Jet Li  2)A hearty spoonfull of Chow Yun Fat  and 3)Enough comedy to make it interesting but not a comedy ;-)
Mix for 20 minutes each episode with as  many interstellar adventures as possible, gun fight scenes, hand to hand  combat scenes, and finally. Add a cute dog, a grumpy sidekick, and a  voluptous woman with a penchant for gambling and you have Cowboy Bebop.
Each of these episodes build on each other as any good anime will. While  the first two don't seem to really intrigue you the 5th episode will hook  you for sure. All the suspense and intrigue is blown wide open while at the  same time making you ask MORE questions about the characters. Truely a work  of art, the scenery is spectacular and the CG that is Top Notch. no  question in my mind, I am pre buying the next tape!",955238400,3,855,4.388535031847134

1069338,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is a very impressive example anime. It's got everything that I believe a good series should contain. While there's not much of a continuing plot this far into the series, the stories in each episode are  very entertaining. The action in the series is top notch and the animation  is some of the finest I've seen. The animation is mostly hand drawn, but on  occasion it is mixed with computer generated elements. I've seen this done  before and I didn't like it, but they've pulled it off very nicely and it  only makes things better in this case. Also, one of the things that I truly  love about this series is the music by Yoko Kanno. The soundtrack is a  jazzy blues style that would be splendid to listen to by itself. However,  the way that it is used in the show is simply amazing. The contrast of  mellow jazz music and fast paced action is enough to send shivers down my  spine. This is done especially well in the first and fifth episodes. All in  all, I'd say that Cowboy Bebop: Session 1 DVD is definitely worth the  money.",954979200,35,1046,4.390625
1069416,4,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop Remix Volume 1 contains the first five episodes of the series.  This ""remix"" version includes new Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mixes of the episodes.  During these first five episodes, we meet Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Ein (the dog), and Faye Valentine.  The series follows this band of motley bounty hunters as they hunt for bounties across the solar system.

Bonus features on the DVD include commentaries by the Japanese voice actors for Spike and Jet, Yutaka Maseba (the ADR English Director), and Wendee Lee (the English speaking voice for Faye Valentine).  Wendee Lee is also interviewed for one of the features on the disc; the interview was rather well done.  There is also a Cartoon Network promo collection and a trailer collection.  In some spots, the Cartoon Network promos were a little ""over the top,"" and some of the trailers in the trailer collection just seemed a little to similar to each other.  In the bonus features, you can also see a ""textless"" version of the ending credits.

Overall, this a decent release.",1195084800,,1039,4.8914285714285715
1069417,5,6305789312,"Lately I have returned to my old ways, and I have been watching a lot of anime. The break I took for a few years allowed for several excellent productions to be released and now I have many highly praised choices at my disposal. This series was one of those options and I am happy to report that my expectations were completely fulfilled. With a very likable main character, excellent action scenes, and some fine humor, this first disc in the series provides top-notch entertainment.

Through these first five episodes we get to see a growth in the series, since the first three are almost a stand-alone set, and deal mostly with individual cases and a fair amount of humor. In episodes four, we already see a change, when Spike and his partner in business Jet Black are joined by the treacherous and temperamental Faye Valentine, who they met in episode three. This new character definitely adds an extra dimension to this series and sets up the tone for the continuity among episodes. Finally, in the last episode, the tone changes and we get a more serious story, which allows for a good look at Spike's past. After you finish watching this disc you will probably be eager for more, so I recommend having the second disc ready to go.

The graphics are very good, and I particularly liked the way in which they created Spike, a tall and lanky guy, with a small head, and who generally dresses in a blue suit and does not show through his appearance his abilities with weapons, and especially in hand-to-hand combat, where he excels. I have to say that one of the aspects that make this series a winner is the beautiful music and the way it is used to complement the action. It all starts with the intro of the disc, when we get black and white scenes, with slow and tranquil music with a classical flavor, and which clearly contrast with the opening credits of each chapter, which show a series of monochromatic shots in color, changing at a frantic pace and accompanied by blazing jazz. All through the episodes, different music genres make their appearance, always complementing the story perfectly.

There is no secret; I have found a new favorite. Now it is time to stop writing and go watch the next disc!",1193443200,,2213,4.611675126903553
1069418,5,6305789312,"This DVD is fantastic! Cowboy Bebop is inspiring thousands today with it's quirky stories and awesome characters. Spike still is amazing. The intro of Faye is well done.

1069419,5,6305789312,"About the Remix, I think the picture quality is better.  Nothing monumental but better nontheless.  Plus, it's not like the original DVDs are really available anymore anyways.  I can sympathize with those who have invested in the originals, but for those of you who haven't gotten this series yet it's your lucky day.

There's nothing else I can really say about this anime that the other reviewers haven't already. It's simply awesome. If you haven't gotten into it yet, go for it.

My main two cents involves the sequence of how you watch this series. I watched it all on Adult Swim before actually purchasing the DVDs. And I didn't always have time to watch each night, so I didn't have a linear viewing experience. I found this to actually be a good thing. I don't want to reveal any spoilers, so I'll say simply that my opinion on getting the most fulfilling experience is to watch the first 5 DVDs straight through. But after that, watch the movie. THEN go on to the 6th DVD. You'll understand why once you've gotten there.

You won't necessarily have any less great of an experience if you decide not to do this. But after having been able to do it this way myself, I can't really imagine it any other way.",1173916800,2,1213,4.5159817351598175
1069420,4,6305789312,"And I must say...it's a show that is well worth the $$. An exceptional story and some of the best animation that I've ever seen!

Here's the only reason why we go from 5 to 4 stars. Bless there hearts, the writing from overseas just doesn't have the same appeal to me as shows and television from the states. They tend to be disjointed and take too many things for granted. I live for the day that someone doesn't just adapt an overseas anime but in fact writes it and then recruits an animation team.

That would be a five star animated series!",1140825600,,545,4.281553398058253
1069421,2,6305789312,"Does anyone else have horrible sound quality on their Remix #1 disk ? I thought this was supposed to be a remix for better sound and I hear all kinds of screaching and poping on the audio on the disk I bought.

Great Anime series - Horrible dvd sound quality.",1134950400,3,259,4.18
1069422,5,6305789312,"This is (also) a review of the REMIX VERSIONS. I won't go into the awesomeness of Cowboy Bebop other than to say that it is the best anime series ever, I'd even call it one of the best television shows ever!

While it has been universally noted on various postings about the remix versions that the sound is significantly better than the original sessions, there are multiple varying reviews on the PICTURE QUALITY. Some say there is no difference at all, some say it's a bit better, some say it's a lot better, all say they have ""checked"" both versions. Well, I took it a step further. I watched both versions side by side on an Avid Nitris Professional video editing system with high definition high resolution (HDHR) monitors and here is the DEFINITIVE ANSWER. There is a difference, they lightened it and did a very slight color correction. Basically, the old versions were a bit dark and some of the detail went unnoticed while the remix versions are lighter and there is more visible detail and color. In terms of viewing expeirience this means that a majority of the scenes look noticibly (if marginally) better. There are certain scenes, however, where the lightness works against it. Some of the more noirish scenes look a bit bleedy. Overall I would say that there is a difference in video quality and that the difference is mostly an improvement. But, even to the die hard fan the difference is negligible.

If you don't own the originals, if they're scratched, if you're a huge fan, if you have an awesome theatre system with good surround, or if you have a crappy small tv and can't see the detail in the image, GET THE REMIX. If not, while they are cool, they're not worth the $30 a pop.",1133740800,119,1701,4.592105263157895
1069423,5,6305789312,"If you're buying this, you are either a HUGE Bebop fan or someone who has been turned into one and didn't get the series the first time out on DVD.

 I'm watching these on a progressive scan DVD player and a HD TV. This first DVD looks and SOUNDS great! The 5.1 is a welcome addition and if you have a home system, you will notice the difference.

 Besides the first few episodes, the DVD also features an interview with voice actress for Faye Valentine. A nice little addition not on the origional DVD.",1132963200,2,503,4.319148936170213
1069424,5,6305789312,"Spike and Jet are united in cause but their backgrounds couldn't be more different. Spike used to work for a crime syndicate while Jet worked for the police. We don't really know how they've ended up together on the ragtag spaceship Bebop but their primary means of income is bounty hunting. And they don't really do such a good job of that, seeing as how they rarely have enough money to pay for meat to go with their noodles! And then they have to rescue a kidnapped data dog named Ein, who is 100% mongrel, but is more intelligent than he lets on. Faye Valentine is another addition to the crew. This stunning and sexy misfit is over 100 years old but her outlook and body are still in youthful shape. Too bad her debts have followed her down the line and she's blackmailed into performing a gangster's errand. What with environmental terrorists and Spike's old comrade Vicious showing up to start a gang war, it's going to be a long while before the Bebop sees any peace!

This is the series that heralded anime's breakthrough into America. Forget about Akira and Ghost in the Shell. This was the first show to really connect with non-anime fans like me and then led into the viewing of other shows and then manga and so on. It's a great show to get non-fans into the medium. The animation looks way beyond the budget of most Japanese TV and is close to motion picture type quality. Even the cast is amazed of the money it took to produce Cowboy Bebop. The acting and the character design really make the show. There's no teenage mecha pilots to be found here and that's a good thing. The English dub is first-rate and probably the greatest dub I've ever heard. Bebop is pretty much the only show I do not listen to in Japanese. The sci-fi elements add a visual punch lacking in such films as Star Wars and the music by that Mozart of anime, Yoko Kanno, completes the great elementary formula for one of the greatest shows ever made. Luckily, unlike a lot of anime out there, Bebop is episodic in nature and does not get dragged down by the weight of heavy story arcs. The pieces of the character's pasts are given a little here, a little there, without ever wasting much of the present.

Of course the main draws on the Remix are the 5.1 sound and what seems to me to be a better picture than previous releases. It looks a lot sharper. There is a hilarious commentary on the first episode by the Japanese actors that played Spike and Jet while the commentary in English is staid and boring. Many promos and commercials and an interview.",1130025600,6,2541,4.450643776824034
1069425,3,6305789312,"1st off, why do 100 people post that haven't bought the remix copy just to say that bebop rules? It makes looking for comments about the remix copy tedious. We all know bebop rules; but IS IT BETTER THAN GETTING THE SESSION 1 DVD???

I would have to say no. Before I give my reasons, I'd like to point out that I do not have an expensive sound system so the updated sound is lost on me. BUT...

- I thought that they remastered the anime itself, and they did not. It looks the same as the original sessions (that was the reason for MY purchase).

-They did throw in a few extras that weren't in the original(some commentaries), but hardly worth a purchase.

-They redid the packaging and it looks like a quick relayout from the old art. I liked the original packaging better. It had the character info on the back, and the dvd was made to look like a record. the new dvd just mimics the cover art.

-They didn't even bother to include a booklet/paper of any kind inside.

-Many animes(Rahxephon, Noir) have been released in boxsets,  or on a signature series (Trigun, Lain) that are cheaper to give the people  that can't shell out $30 a dvd a chance to get it. You have to wait a little while, and it doesn't usually have some of the goodies that the original had; but the money has already been made. Of course they are releasing this ""remix"" of bebop (which has been out for a good 7 years or so) for the full $30.

Basically in my opinion, if you are going to go through the trouble to re-release it, AND charge full price; GO ALL THE WAY!!! (Like the Calvin and Hobbes Collection coming out.) If you are going to charge $30 for a 1998 anime; make it worth my 30.(But it's not about the money; it's for the fans) (sarcasm).

1069477,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is arguably one of the finest works film to come out in a long while, and most certainly one of the finest Anime, period. Taking place in 2071 Bebop follows the exploits of a group of down-on-their-luck bounty hunters with mysterious or unimportant pasts as they try and, often, fail to make the big score. That's really it, each episode is like a short film (some are like a kick in the pants and others more somber) and sometimes episodes are even overtly connected to each other. Still as the show progresses the pieces come together and the pasts and futures of these characters become clear. Not that the pieces need to be clear, even if the show had no point the mix of comedy, action, sci-fi, and an amazing soundtrack make Bebop one crazy fun ride.

On this first disc, containing episodes 1 - 5 (Asteroid Blues, Stray Dog Strut, Honky Tonk Women, Gateway Shuffle, and Ballad of Fallen Angels), viewers are introduced to Spike, Jet, Ein (a dog), and Faye-in that order. The first four episodes introduce four of the five main characters and the general setting of the Bebop Universe, while episode 5 really starts to dig into the past of Spike. All of the episodes are good, but in this volume it is episode 5 that really shines.

Although this disc has not yet been released the animation of Bebop was top quality when the show was first released in 1998 and the re-mastering and new scenes can only add to the original quality. Also, the soundtrack has always been well planned and judging from the best of set that was released a while ago, having 5.1 will make it even better.

But never did I find one that could speak to me like this. It is quite possibly my favorite show of all time. It has every thing that is needed to be a great show. It has comedy, violence, a genious plot, thought provoking theories, genuinly likable charachters (my favorite is the incredibly hot Faye Valentine), and some of the most in depth backstories I've ever heard. I will admit I didn't have high hopes for this series at first due to a slow first two episodes at which nothing of any relevance happens but by the third episode I felt like doubting this series was like commiting blasphemy. It tells the tale of Bounty hunter Spike, expolice officer Jet, the casino cheating feme fatal Faye, the greatest haker ever Ed, and a spunky data dog named Ein.

The varitey of music, from soft jazz tunes to fast-paced bluegrass? I could start and tell you that this is a beautiful anime. It is definatley a masterpiece in it's time, and should be considered more than just a ""mainstream anime"" such as Yugioh and Pokemon. Oh, much more my friend. This anime is beyond words. I can't even describe the wonderfulness we all know as Cowboy Bebop.
Here is a breif storyline.
Spike Spiegel was a member of a famous crime syndicate called the Red Dragon. Him and his friend, Vicious, were both in love with a woman named Julia. Spike decided to leave the syndicate, sick of the death and the life he led. He asked Julia to go with him, but she refused, because she cared for herself more than him. Vicious told her that if she left with Spike, he would kill her. So now, Vicious sends Julia on a mission to Kill Spike. This story only occurs in flashbacks, but is VERY importaint to the stoyline, for SPike has encounters with his past more than once, and almost dosent make it through these encounters.
Later on, Spike sees himself as ""dead."" Dead to the Syndicate, killed by the woman he loved. The year is 2075, three years after he left the syndicate. He joins up with Jet Black, a former cop with the ISSP. Later on comes the Gambling Femme Fatale, Faye Valentine who has lost her memory due to cyrogenic freezing after the hyperspace gate exploded, destroying much life on earth, and forcing people to colonize on planets and moons. Also, Ein the Data dog, and everyone's favorite, Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky the 4th(She named herself). Ed is the 13-year-old girl hacker genius who is off the wall, and completley strange! Everybody loves Ed!(if not they are completley annoyed by her.)This wacky,insane bounty hunting crew is to make history, a new genre in itself which shall be called : COWBOY BEBOP",1067212800,5,1959,4.6976744186046515
1069483,5,6305789312,"To describe it's brilliance.  I've tried many times, but every time my description comes up short.  I've already done a review for the whole set (a great Amazon exclusive I highly recommend instead of purchasing one at a time).  I'm just gonna go episode by episode.  If you want Char bios, take a look at one of the other 100+ reviews here, I don't waste space.
1: Asteroid Blues: Series opening, quick glimpse into Spike's past, then normal episode.  One of the finer moments is when Spike beats up a bad guy while he is on a performance enhancing drug (great first hand-to-hand combat scene).  I'm trying not to ruin the episode, so just watch it.
2: Stray Dog Strut: Ein-isode, where the little data-dog is introed.  Good Enter-the-Dragonish pretences and whatnot, as well as the funny comment ""Seems that way"", and showing that scientists may be geniuses, but are also stupid sometimes.
3: Honky Tonk Women: Faye-isode, introing the Queen of Hearts, a con artist and general scoundrel.  Wonderful space-combat and pretty funny plot, letting Faye come out on top for once.
4: Gateway Shuffle: Mainly a normal episode, with little meaning and interest.  I personally think it's the worst in the series (though still better than any episode of Trigun).  The only thing this sets up is that Jet has connections in the ISSP (Stellar Police)
5: Ballad of Fallen Angels: Spike-isode, the first of many, showing a bit more of the coolness seen in the beginning of Asteroid Blues.  It seems Spike used to be a mob hitman along side Vicious, a wicked alter ego and obvious antagonist.  When you see Spike don a trenchcoat, you will be hitting one of the coolest scenes in all of cinema, especially because of tone, lighting, and music.  I am currently looking into getting the soundtrack of the series just because of the end of this episode.
All together, this is probably the best of the DVDs, although I think it's solely because of Episode 5.  The extras aren't wonderful, but you're getting an extra episode for your cash.  While I say it's the best DVD, if the series isn't complete, it's not worth buying.  I still suggest you buy the full set (you can get there via a review I did by clicking on my name above).

It follows two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who search for bounties in order to keep themselves fed. This first disc contains the first five episodes and mark the first appearances of Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein and Vicious (Ed's first appearance was in episode 9 ""Jamming with Edward"", which is on Session 2). If you haven't checked out Cowboy Bebop yet, now would be a better time than never to do so.",1064880000,2,521,4.381443298969073
1069545,5,6305789312,"This is a beautiful series, the best anime I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of it.  If you've never watched anime before, this is really the perfect series to start with, and disc 1 is the perfect DVD.
The first 4 episodes are good in their own right, they introduce you to the main characters, the style and feel of the series, the ubiquitous sense of humor, the sci fi futuristic back drop.  These first four are not stunning and appeared to depict an episodic series which was interesting and entertaining but perhaps without much background and mythology.
Then I saw the 5th episode ""Ballad of fallen angels"" and I was shocked.  It is such a stunningly gorgeous episode I was caught completely off guard.  It was the episode that introduced elements from spikes past heretofore unknown to us.  You become aware at the level of thought and depth of the series, that the characters all have intricate and detailed histories that still affect them profoundly.  In fact that turns outs to be a reoccurring theme throughout the series, how none of us can truly escape our pasts.  Another strange metaphor that continuously reoccurs throughout the episodes is spikes reference to life being like `watching a dream', I'm not sure why that image is used but it could perhaps refer to eastern mysticism and Buddhism where waking up from the dream of life and seeing what is true is an often used metaphor. My sense of the show completely changed when I saw this installment, I became curious as to what all the images and references to spikes past meant.
The last scene in the episode, spikes 'fall from grace' from the spires of the beautifully drawn cathedral, is maybe the most artistic thing I've ever seen in any entertainment genre.  From the dual with his nemesis Vicious to the mysterious and somehow sad images from his past flashing before his eyes to the moody piano sonata, this scene and this episode remains my favorite in the entire brilliant series.
If you watch this DVD, you'll know if the series is for you after you watch the 5th episode.  If you watch the entire series prepare yourself for the saddest ending you could imagine.  The ending is more tragic than the Shakespearean tragedies you might have read in high school or college.  A tear dripped down my face when I had finished the series, and I'm a manly man so that speaks to how very sad it is.  I really can't recommend `Cowboy Bebop' any more highly, see it if you can... you won't soon forget its beauty.",1063324800,2,2485,4.622727272727273
1069546,5,6305789312,"This is a favorite anime of mine that aired on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network until this week. For all of you that want to get into anime, I believe this is a great place to start.

1069547,4,6305789312,"From long Jazz Riffs to bloody gunfights, Cowboy Bebop has, as many others have, redefined Japanese Animation. The most amzing fell you get is from the music that has been put in this anime. In fact, the producers thought the musical part of the series so important, they inserted 'Bebop' into the name. Bebop is the musical term for a series of comlex harmonies and melodies. There are times that you just can not believe the music. Overall, this anime takes a look at the darker side of the future. A bounty hunter, Spike Seigel, gangs up with faye valentine and a retired cop to make a living as a joined group of bounty hunters. I could liken the plot to a roller coaster, some of the episodes are just one-shots, they have no meaning or any real relevance to the overallstoryline, they just buff up the jazz and gunfights. But every few episodes an episode creeps along that actually does something, like defines the character's pasts. The basic animation is drawn in a much higher definition than most (I speak of most of the gundam series, and many other choppy animes) and when combined with computer animation, makes extremely detailed backgrounds and foregrounds. This peice was done very well, with good expertise and good employees. As a final note to promote all of you doubtful peoples, the ending epidodes of this anime are perhaps the most well done and filling ones I have ever see in an anime. They will leave you more. But if you ever do finish watching all of the episodes, your in luck, there has been some recent work on the Cowboy Bebop movie, Knockin on Heavens Door, which is already out in Japan and there have been arrangements to have it be e made in english.",1048723200,,1687,4.589403973509934
1069548,5,6305789312,"In 2071 A.D., outer space was the real frontier.  Leaving Earth's troubles behind, a chaosium of people headed out to the stars, creating an untamed society where lawless was a commonplace and bounty hunters often were the means to justice.  In the middle of all this, Spike Spiegel, and his partner Jet Black, pilot their ship, the Bebop.  Always broke and often disreputable, the one thing we can count on is that they are never very far from deep trouble.
This first set of five episodes serves primarily to introduce use to our protagonists.  Spike Spiegel is a syndicate man - young, brash, and a top-notch fighter.  Jet Black is and ex-cop, older, calmer, and more inclined to worry about their eternally low bankroll.  In the second episode (Stray Dog Strut) we meet Ein the Welsh wonder corgi.  In the third (Honky Tonk Women) Faye Valentine appears.  Faye is pretty, intelligent, and a good match for Spike, but she is even more likely to find trouble than he is.
All of the stories except the fifth (Ballad of Fallen Angels) are picaresque adventure stories with a slightly noir, 1970's retro twist.  Whether the bad guys are wanted for dog nabbing or trying to infect whole planets with a virus that turns humans back into apes, the team wins the battle, but never seems to get the cash.  The last episode is darker, taking up back into Spike's history when Faye runs afoul of Vicious, one of Spikes old enemies.  The general mood is jazzy and upbeat, though, with comic lines keeping the sometimes-grim violence from overwhelming the script.
What makes this series really sparkle is the high level of production values.  The art is a snappier version of Blade Runner, with a fine sense of the graphic and a lot of in-jokes buried in the backdrops.  Animation and fight choreography are solid with all the necessary violence.  In addition, the series features Yoko Kanno's music throughout.  That alone makes the episodes worth viewing.  She shows herself capable of working in multiple styles especially the jazzy theme work.
If the plots are a bit empty-headed, it is no worse than the 'Route 66' and '77 Sunset Strip' shows that the stories seem to be derived from.  I found this an eminently rewatchable series, and intent to follow up with the rest of the DVD's when my wallet is healthy again.",1043020800,12,2310,4.74937343358396
1069549,5,6305789312,"The title is mighty high praise to give any story, but Cowboy Bebop is one of those works of art that continues to awe you long after you finish. That tremendous journey starts with this DVD.
My friend started me off on anime from his quite sizable collection. Having been awed by things like Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Neon Genesis: Evangelion, I also watched and mostly didn't like anime like Fushigi Yuugi, Battle Angel, and Sin. Then I was stuck. None of my friend's remaining anime appealed to me, so I struck out to find something new that neither of us had tried yet. I had heard Cowboy Bebop mentioned once before and took a chance on the first DVD...basically just on a whim. It was the start of an incredible journey that I place in the lofty company of Lord of the Rings, Final Fantasy 7, and Hamlet as my favorite stories.
Each of the first four episodes on this DVD are great and entertaining in their own right. In the end though, it was the fifth that hooked me forever. ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" is in a class of its own. Something about the title, the music, the art, the characters...it just resonates. Amazing. Have you ever seen a cooler entrance for the ultimate villain than emerging from shadows while someone sings Ave Maria? It's AVE MARIA!! Vicious isn't the usual wishy-washy, misunderstood victim of society you see everywhere these days. He's just so cold...so evil. It will make you shiver.
Give this show a chance. If you like this first DVD, you'll be hooked straight through all six. If you find you don't like the show after episode 5 (is that possible???), I don't think you'll enjoy the rest.",1041552000,4,1639,4.559322033898305

You get five, count 'em five super episodes, from the introductory ""Asteroid Blues"" to the very funny ""Stray Dog Strut"" to the sassy and often funny ""Honky Tonk Women"" to the satiric ""Gateway Shuffle"" to the sublime ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"".  Each is a stand alone episode but subtle clues about the main story do emerge with repeated viewing, like the layers of an onion.  And while this may make some people mad I *like* that the annoying Ed is absent from these episodes (sorry Ed fans).  About the only disappointing thing I could point to would be the text on the back of the DVD, which is either very badly written (like by someone who doesn't really know the episodes) or a horrible translation.  The box art makes Spike look like some kind of martial arts psychopath; he's really a laid-back, joke-cracking wise-guy who is rarely serious except where his (for the moment) hidden past is concerned.  On the other hand a plus of the DVD is you do not have to endure the Cartoon channel's typically dumb censorship, so the episodes have the occasional off-color language, blood, and drug use complete and intact.  The ""extras"" with the DVD aren't all that great either, but they aren't the reason you should be getting into Bebop.

  the animation is amazing. considering this is a tv series a lot of money has been spent on this. though not used all the time, cgi has been utilised to great effect. it merges with the conventional cel animation very well.
  the dubbing is right on. its actually better than the japanese voice acting, as there are a lot of different dialects used, from african-american to russian.
  music wise, it deserves awards. yoko kanno (plus the seatbelts) have created a soundtrack that includes lots of genres of music, with the main one being jazz, but also including heavy metal,classical, techno etc. amazing.

1069601,5,6305789312,"A really great opening DVD for the series. The final episode, Ballad of Fallen Angels, gets most of the attention, and rightfully so, but the DVD is fantastic from start to finish.

Episode 1: Asteroid Blues

This is where we first meet the bounty hunting duo of Spike and Jet. Always on the hunt, not always successful when things are all said and done. Not that they aren't good at what they do, it's just that bounty hunting isn't as easy as it might seem for the very skilled combo. Either just flat out losing their bounty (read: Them dying), or doing damage along the way that uses up all of their money that they just made.

In Asteroid Blues, there's a new drug called Red Eye, and they must track down a dealer, who has a bounty on his head. He and his wife are planning an escape to Mars, but first they have to sell off the Red Eye to become rich enough to live there. Will Spike be swayed by the charms of the mother-to-be, or will he take care of business? Nice action, some comedy thrown in, and a not so typical ending. Overall, a great episode. Score: 4 1/2 out of 5

Episode 2: Stray Dog Strut

Spike and Jet are hired to recover an item stolen from a research scientist's lab. Surprisingly, that item is a dog. But there's something special about this dog, what is it? The chase scene about mid-way through is one of the most entertaining I've seen. The music that plays during it makes the chase even more exciting! The comedy is top notch through out the episode as well. Score: 4 stars out of 5

Episode 3: Honky Tonk Women

Enter Faye Valentine. As she's in the middle of a very shady deal, Spike and Jet run across her in a casino. Who's side is she really on? Score: 4 stars out of 5

Episode 4: Gateway Shuffle

""The Space Warriors"", known as Eco-Terrorists, plan to unleash an experimental virus if their demands aren't meant. Their demands? To stop killing helpless animals. Kind of like those animal rights groups, only these people aren't going to be nice about it. The virus turns humans into apes. Spike and Jet, tempted by the 25 million bounty on her head, aren't going to let them get away with it. This episode has one of the greatest moments in anything I've seen. You'll know it when you see it. Score: 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.

Episode 5: Ballad of Fallen Angels

Ah, possibly the finest episode until the series reaches it's finale with episode's #25 and #26. The first four episodes, as with many of the episodes in this series, don't really have anything to do with the main plot. They are just there for character development and to show you the lives they lead. This is the first episode to focus on the main plot. Spike's past, unfourtanately, has caught up with him. Instead of running from his past forever, he decides to confront it, head on, against the deadly Vicious. One of Spike's old ""friends"". The fight, the atmosphere, the music, it's all perfectly done. Once you watch it you will realize the magic that this series really is. Score: 5 stars out of 5

Overall: 5 stars

The action is there, and it's brilliant. The artistic style is beautifully done. You immediately grow attached to the characters, and you will love them even more before the series is done with. This is just the beginning.

1069686,5,6305789312,"In short, Cowboy Bebop is a chronicle of the ca-razy adventures of four bounty hunters and an eerily intelligent dog. Obviously, if you took this general synopsis at face value, I can bet that you wouldn't be particularly interested in sacrificing a good portion of your leisure time to watch something that sounds like THAT- it sounds closer to the sort of thing that makes you want to throw a remote control into the TV and watch David Letterman or something. However, Cowboy Bebop is so much more then your standard bounty hunter show- it's extremely original, very addictive, and extremely stylish- not to mention there's nothing else really like it in movies or film. Cowboy Bebop has the commendable ability to bring together parts from all sorts of genre's of live action film and Japanese anime and glue it all back together into something with real style and a sense of humor- Bebop is certainly a professional work, but it also doesn't take itself seriously in the pretentious way a lot of them there' anime series are lately- it makes jokes at itself and the humor is always sly and vaguely dark- a large amount of cuteness is not something you'll be forced to weather as you watch this DVD. If you enjoy following long, sweeping plot lines and consider filler episodes the bane of your existence, it might be wise to stay away from Bebop- the intent of this show is definitely not to tell a completely fleshed out and epic story, because this series is all about the characters.
Each of the characters is well fleshed out and has a past and a present- the desperate citizens of the good ship (or well disguised hell hole) Bebop range the gamut from Spike Spiegel, a lanky young martial artist with a dangerous PAST that he can't quite escape from, to Jet Black, a gruff former cop with an adoration of bonsai trees and cooking (badly), to Edward, an insane hacker girl who's never apart from a super intelligent Welsh Corgi called Ein, and we've even got the token Hot Girl, except that Faye Valentine, a tough and shrewish woman who can't even remember HER past, happens to be a lot more then fan service aimed at 14 year old boys. However, these bounty hunters, turning the genre on it's head, aren't very efficient- they rarely catch their man and they're usually out of money, eating bell peppers and beef or dog food (!) until the next bounty comes up.
  Either way, Bebop is one of those series that just sort of sweeps you along- as the series proceeds, you're given enticing snippets about each characters past, and even by the end of the series, all of your question haven't been answered- one of the great things about Bebop is that it's open to interpretation. Again, the sessions are all over the place in subject- you'll get plot sessions and hard core action sessions and humor sessions and romance sessions- Bebop is very good at variety.
Thankfully, the animation completely matches the story- the animation is a good as most anime movie releases, and the special effects and character design are all incredible- perhaps one of the most stand-out aspects of the series is the wonderful painting of the cities the Bebop crew stumbles through in search of the latest bounty- the cities all really look like you'd expect them to look in 2071- kind of futuristic, but still maintaining the definite possibility of a seedy underworld beneath the surface. The Bebop world is one of the most realistic future worlds you'll find in a series-unlike the utopian (and extremely boring) worlds of most science fiction series, the Bebop world is still full of crime, corruptness, and general good old fashioned sinning'- this isn't a children's series either.
As you could have already guessed, yes, I do highly recommend this series- it's my favorite tv show/movie(and that includes live action) and it's simply one of the best things to come out of Japan in a long time- and you certainly don't have to be an anime fan to enjoy it. Bebop is for everyone who can appreciate good entertainment.",1017446400,3,4009,4.725714285714286
1069687,5,6305789312,"From the opening moments, a montage of black and white images of a man with a bouquet of red roses against a backdrop of a gun fight in a cathedral, set to a slight little music-box melody, Cowboy Bebop is one of the most captivating and well-made anime series of all time.
The series is generally episodic, each 22 minute segment independent from the rest, but there are longer story arcs which span the entire series, and a good deal of relatively subtle character development that takes course over the series' 26 episodes.
The music put to very interesting use. Yoko Kanno, the composer, uses a number of different musical styles, from jazz, to hard jungle, each style fitting the on-screen situations perfectly. It's not a traditional mix, however, and you'll find soft, thoughtful ballads accompanying deadly chases through space, instead of the usual, more ""exciting"" music.
The harmony of the visual style, the soundtrack, and the excellent (often humorous) writing achieves a sort of synaethasia that most works of art can only hope to achieve. In Bebop, it almost seems effortless.",1016496000,2,1091,5.0
1069688,5,6305789312,"An instant classic.  Some of the most beautiful animation I have seen, especially for a series.  Adult themes, complex characters, a realistic 'blade-runner'-esque environment, and some excellent cross genre music.  I highly recommend it.",1016409600,,238,5.9411764705882355
1069689,4,6305789312,"I'd heard a lot about this anime, so, since I had some money burning a hole in my pocket, I decided to try it out. And while this first Session doesn't live up to ALL the hype it's received, it certainly deserves the majority of the praise it gets.
In the first episode, ""Asteroid Blues"", we meet the two main characters, Spike and Jet. Spike is a non-chalant, no worries kind of guy, and seems to have an affinity for cigarettes and one-liners. Jet is the brains of the operation, sort of. He's mean looking, mean sounding, but in reality is more of a father figure to Spike than anything else.
The two are bounty hunters. They travel through space catching criminals and bringing them in for the rewards. The first villain we're shown is a common drug dealer aiming to make it big. Spike and Jet, despite not wanting to deal with ""small fries"", go after him anyway, as he's really the only bounty available to them.
On a side note, I should mention the computer animations merges flawlessly with the hand-drawn. Titan A.E. did a good job, but Cowboy Bebop does it better.
In the second ep, ""Stray Dog Strut"", we get a bit of comic relief. Spike and Jet take a job to capture a thief who took an important item from a laboratory. (Side Note: I was keeled over laughing at the thief. He looks like... Kobe Bryant.) Spike doesn't hve any trouble finding the thief, but catching the item is another story...
The third ep, ""Honky Tonk Women"", introduces Faye Valentine, a scantily clad gambler and experienced fighter. She gets caught up in a scheme at a casino to get a ""special"" poker chip for the owner. And, of course, Spike and Jet happen to drop by at the casino and get thrown into the middle of it.
The fourth ep, ""Gateway Shuffle"", takes sci-fi to a new level. An eco-terrorist group is holding a world ransom with a specially designed virus, just to save an endangered species. Of course, the bounty on the leader's head is enough to get Spike and Jet interested in the escapade.
The last ep, ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"", gives us a look back at Spike's past. The music shifts from upbeat jazz to mostly classical, orchestra music, which fits the mood well. The battle scene at the end is extremely well done, as well as extremely violent. In it, we get to know Vicious, a man from Spike's past, and a very cool villain. For anyone who's played Final Fantasy 7, Vicious reminds me very much of Sephiroth, in both look and mannerisms. Needless to say, the ending is out of this world, and really is what hooked me on for more.
However, I should warn about a couple things. It definately falls under the 13 and up rating, both for violence, and Spike's somewhat foul mouth. There's also a scene with a porno magazine, but nothing is shown that you can't get from buying a Barbie doll and stripping it.
All in all, Cowboy Bebop grabs you from the start. It's grip slips a little near the end, but once you get past the slow-moving 4th episode, it'll grab your attention, and most likely your wallet, again.",1014768000,5,3008,4.48087431693989
1069690,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is the best and most advanced anime of all time. I saw the first episode on Cartoon Network late at night. After the first episode I fell in love with the show. I told all my freinds at school about it but no one knew what I was talking about. Everyone keeps talking about DBZ. Well I'm tired of DBZ. It's old to me. I needed a new show to watch. Cowboy Bebop is the smoothest and most action packed anime to ever graze it's way into Adult Swim. I like the show so much that I couldn't get enough of it. So I bought this DVD.
If you liked the show on TV and want to see the episodes whenever you want then you should get this DVD. Go get all the sessions. They are worth every dime!",1014508800,,695,3.9361702127659575

Highly recommended!!!",1013385600,,294,4.673076923076923
1069777,5,6305789312,"As the first episode begins, a catchy jazz song hits you head on.  Cowboy Bebop is one of the best new series out.  The first DVD introduces you to many of the characters including the Bebop duo, Jet and Spike, the gorgeous and shifty Faye Valentine, the genious dog Ein, and the mysterious Vicious.  The episodes are a mixture of comedy, action, and intense drama.  This series is definately not just a cartoon. It is an intricate well planned piece of post-modern culture.",1012780800,,474,4.674698795180723
1069778,5,6305789312,"I'm not an anime aficionado.  Until recently, my exposure was the Robotech series when I was growing up.  In fact, the recent release of Robotech on DVD inspired me to look for other anime that I might enjoy, at an adult level.  Cowboy Bebop is better than I could have even hoped it to be.
I want to buy the sound track to an anime series.  Riiiiiight.  An anime series.  I've got to be kidding, right?  I'm not.  I consider the music to be one of the three key things to what makes this series great.  Usually you are happy if the music isn't awful; content to just have it not get in the way.  Here, you want to see the next scene partly to hear the next soundtrack.
The second part for me is the characters and voice acting.  Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein (in order of descending coolness) are each unique, tragic, hilarious and human in their own way. The supporting cast (e.g., usually the bounties themselves) are well thought out and imaginative.  The English voice acting is spot on, and I even prefer it to the original Japanese.
Finally, the writing is solid.  I usually watch anime thinking that it was okay or good, but if they had just ""done it this way"", I'd have loved it.  Cowboy Bebop is the first time I've been totally satisified with each episode.  The episodes alternate between serious to tragic to hilarious, and even to the surreal.  I haven't seen Session 6, although I do know how it ends (I shouldn't have read all the reviews), but I do appreciate that the writers had an end state in mind when writing Cowboy Bebop.
Own this if you are a fan of anime, but even if you aren't, it is better than most live action shows in Prime Time.
See You Space Cowboy. . .",1012348800,,1686,4.304761904761905
1069779,5,6305789312,"Sure, the name ""Cowboy Bebop"" is enough to make anyone not interested in anime snicker at the name. And, like anything else, ""Cowboy Bebop"" isn't for everyone. But anyone who loves sci-fi, intense action, humor that's funny, or just anime in general will undoubtedly discover that ""Cowboy Bebop"" is one of the greatest anime series to come along...ever.
Anyone even remotely interested in anime will have heard about this series at one time or another, and about how good it is. They've also wondered: is it really that good? Answer: yes, it is. ""Cowboy Bebop"" follows the adventures of the crew of the ship ""Bebop"", run by bounty hunters Spike and Jet. They are eventually joined by a ""data-dog"" called Ein and the femme-fatale known as Faye Valentine. The first five episodes included on the ""Session One"" DVD mainly deal with the characters meeting each other, as well as trying to keep themselves from starving by going after bounty heads so they can collect the reward money.
The first five episodes are also just that: episodes. There really isn't anything that connects the stories together. For example, Episode 1, ""Asteroid Blues"" deals with Spike and Jet going after a man selling a drug called Red-Eye, then Episode 2, ""Stray Dog Strut"", involves Spike and Jet trying to catch a man who stole something valuable from a laboratory. Some people might feel uncomfortable that the series doesn't have an underlying plot initially, but most people will ignore it, especially when the series showcases its undeniable charm.
The characters in ""Cowboy Bebop"" are very well fleshed-out and unforgettable. The way they act is so natural and so well-executed viewers will almost forget they are watching anime. Speaking of which, the eye-candy is amazing, blending in computer effects with fluid animation that's practically perfect. The series uses this to its advantage when it comes to the action, which is very intense and fast-paced. And the stories told are simply brilliant and flow smoothly and effortlessly. Of course, several scenes of blood, gore, and occasional glimpses of nudity (not to mention language) make ""Cowboy Bebop"" suitable for audiences over 13.
Soundwise, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is phenomenal. Most anime fans know about the hit-and-miss of dubbing, but this series is a definite hit. The voices match the characters so perfectly I consider them better than the original Japanese voices! And the music...oh, the music! Famed music artist Yoko Kanno (""Vision of Escaflowne"", ""Macross Plus"") has created the ultimate experience in music for ""Cowboy Bebop"". The opening song, ""Tank!"", is a magnificent jazz piece that everyone will love, and Yoko Kanno's music is used to its maximum potential in the defining Episode 5, ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"". In short, the sound of the series is in a league of its own.
DVD-wise, I'm thankful that Bandai decided to give ""Cowboy Bebop"" the attention it deserves. Picture quality is close to perfect, and the sound is just as good. The extras aren't too many, but we are treated to a music video of the full-version of ""Tank!"" and some brief character introductions.
All in all, ""Cowboy Bebop: Session One"" is a must-own DVD for all anime fans. Even non-anime viewers should give this series serious consideration because of three little words: it's that good!",1011657600,2,3313,5.069597069597069
1069780,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop isn't just good anime. You'll read a lot of reviews that compare it to other groundbreaking anime like Akira and Ghost In The Shell, but that sells this excellent series short.
'Anime' describes not just a style of animation, but a collection of story conventions, none of which appear in Cowboy Bebop. There are no tentacled monstrosities, no Megacorporations conspiring to destroy NeoTokyo, no weird nature spirits being corrupted by consumerism.
Instead we're left with one of the best TV series' ever. Almost everything that happens will make perfect sense to the average western viewer, and it all stands up to any modern TV series. The Sopranos, The West Wing, Queer as Folk, it's got them all beat. Because unlike all of these excellent shows, Cowboy Bebop switches tone, scope, and genre with almost every episode. One episode is slapstick farce, one is romantic soap opera, one is nail-biting action, one is tense psychothriller. And Cowboy Bebop never misses a beat, each episode is finely crafted with a level of detail given each 22 minutes that you'd normally have to watch an entire series of to see on HBO.
Cowboy Bebop also has something all other western shows lack; Yoko Kanno. Her music is sheer genius. She works playfully and seriously in every style, and thus fits these fantastic stories that are sometimes insightful, sometimes meaningful, sometimes sublime, sometimes ridiculous. Cowboy Bebop loves its own soundtrack and devotes one or two scenes each episode to showcase the music. The director intentionally lets Kanno's music come to the fore and orchestrates several scenes with no dialog in order to let the music shine. Few shows do this, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The emotional impact of each episode is raised to new levels though the use of her music, and you'd be a fool not to buy the soundtrack.
The series is a Sci-Fi romp set in the near future, our solar system. The main characters are bounty hunters (called 'cowboys') onboard a spaceship (the Bebop) owned by an inveterate jazz aficionado who dreams of Charlier Parker. `Bounty hunter' may evoke dark mysterious characters like Boba Fett, and the main characters here *do* have mysterious pasts and they *are* lethal killers, but they're entirely human, living day to day on the few bounties they bring in. The characters can be serious, funny, sexy, goofy. . .everything you'd expect from realistically drawn characters who are, at the same time, lethal killers.
Don't mistake this for Anime, it obliterates the genre conventions and comes screaming out of the gate with a refreshing collection of stories that will make you pound your cable box and scream ""why can't it all be like this!?!"" The director and writer are aware of what they've created, these characters are living day by day, achieving nothing significant in their lives, yet they're having a great time and we have a great time with them. We don't want it to end. The main character asks us, ""Don't you want to hang out with us and waste your life away?"" The answer, of course, is `yes,' and the writer knew it when he wrote it.
One aspect which is decidedly *not* western, is the ending. This show ends the only way it could, the most fulfilling way possible, and when the credits roll for the final time, you'll feel like you lived an entire lifetime in the past few hours.
And what a lifetime it was...",1010361600,2,3384,4.846286701208981
1069781,5,6305789312,"An excelent beggining to an excellent series. Lemme first say that the american voice acting on this series is excellent. Many translated series have a problem with funky voices on the characters, but Cowboy Bebop sounds fantastic. Anyways, this series is much more mainstream than many of it's anime counterparts. It doesnt contain the goofy animatiions or cutesy characters or spastic animations that run rampant in many other japanese series. BAsically this is a great series for people who don't really like the typical japanese animation, but enjoy the more adult/gritty themes they portray. There is  some violence, swearing and drug use on this disk, so make sure yer over 13 or whatever the norm on that is. Now on to the disc. Looks great, sounds great. The menu interface is kinda annoying, but its a minor gripe.  ""Ballad of Angels"" the last episode on this disc is phenominal. If i was ever doubting buying session 2, then this episode destroyed any doubt. Besides that, every episode is pretty damned good, and introduces teh majority of the cast right off. If ya wanna preview the series before you buy it and can't find it to rent, cartoon network is showing it in their ""adult swim"" programming block.  Definately different than Dragon Ballz and Sailor moon, so if youv'e only seen those before this, don't expect anything remotely similar.

I can't stop watching Episode 5 in this case,  SO BEAUTIFULLY done! and the music in the end puts a tear in the eye.

1069785,5,6305789312,"this is a story when the dark past and the unknow future is the only way of the characters. Spike and Jet are bounty hunters and they have an old fishing ship called The Bebop, it's 2071 and the humans conquered the space but the delinquency and the criminals still there. the I.S.S.P. (Inter Solar Systems Police)have to appeal to hunters like a support system to fight agains the space pirates and others criminals.
In the first episode (asteroid blues), Asimov was a member of a group drug dealer but he stole a drug called bloody eye and ran away with his girlfriend. Spike accept the job to catch him for the bounty. The fugitives are scaping from the ex group of Asimov and from Spike but they're penned and Asimov can't drive his spaceship animore. his girlfriend will make a drastic decision.
In the second episode(Stray dog strut) will join in a new member of the Bebop. It's a dog that Spike find in another of his hunting things. He was behind a thief that stole an important secret experiment (yeah, you guessed it) it's the dog , a welsh Corgi. Spike and Jet don't know what to do whith it so, they adopt it and give him a name : Ein (from Einstein). Ein has and incredible intelligence (it's because a genetic experiment)
In the Third episode(Honky Tonk Women) We will know an extrange woman (Faye Valentine) in a Casino when she works delivering information to criminals contacs(friends of the owner of the casino). Spike and Jet go to this casino to bet some money and Faye confuse Spike with the contact. Finally, Faye will be pursued by his boss and she don't have other option that join to the team of the Bebop.
In the fourth episode(Gateway Shuffle) The Space Warriors are a terrorist ecological group that want to disseminate a virus called Monkey Business(this virus transforms the person who incubate it into a monkey). The bebop team pursue them in the spacegate and the result of this persecution is the transform of the space warriors into monkeys because the containers of the virus brake away in their spaceship.
In the fifth episode(Ballad of Fallen Angels)the dark past of Spike is partially discovered. He was a member of a Mafia called the Red Dragons of Mars, and he was friend of Vicius (another member) who is his enemy now (the worse one of all). At the final of this chapter Spike has to fight against him because Faye was captured and used like a bait.
The music of this anime is one of the best (it was made by Yoko Kanno -she works also in Macross Plus, Escaflowne, Brain Power, Please save the Earth. Her music combines jazz, mambo, rock, folk, country and gospel. this is her most complete work). The opening music is a mambo with a little of jazz (you have to heard it to know what i'm talking about), in the fifth episode a beautiful song(Green Bird) is used it in the battle between Spike and Vicius. The lyrics of her songs are in japanese, english, french, and an invented language for her.",1004745600,2,2938,4.555765595463138
1069850,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is the one of those anime series that you can't let go of. Period. The music and animation blend together, never divided and never separated. Each go through the series, intricately introducing complex characters, each with their own mysterious past. The ""hero"", or the main character is Spike Speigel, a bounty hunter with a retro sense of style. He typically is carefree, loose, and a reckless man with no worries. His partner is Jet Black, an ex-ISSP (some interstellar police force) with a cyborg arm. Jet is reminiscent of Shaft, cool but always reminding Spike to keep his mind in check. Those two both want to let go of the past, something extremely difficult to do at times. While on a bounty, they meet a woman named Faye Valentine, a beauty with a gambling streak. She also doesn't have a clue about her past (which will be introduced in ""My Funny Valentine""). She hops aboard the Bebop and rides along with their galactic adventures.
This series will mostly appeal to people who don't mind a good, dirty anime that gets down to business. I've heard people referring Cowboy Bebop as the ""Quentin Tarantino of Japanese animes."" Though making some references to pop culture, Cowboy Bebop definitely isn't like other animes. It's characters, plot, music, and style is original. Director Watanabe does an excellent job, providing the Bebop with enough grittiness to satisfy fans of anime like Trigun. Another notable highlight is the music. Yoko Kanno composed the Tank! the opening of Cowboy Bebop. It's one word-- excellent. It's like ear candy, you can never get enough.",1001376000,,1592,4.9440298507462686

1069852,5,6305789312,"Bebop is, to put it bluntly, quite possibly the greatest anime series ever made. Instead of just focusing on one or two, the series touches on a wide range of entertainment genres, from comedy to action to intense drama, it's all carried flawlessly by the same main characters, and throughout the whole thing, the flow is only broken *maybe* once (referring to Session 23, ""Brain Scratch""). There is something in this anime for EVERYONE, whether you're an anime fan or not, and it's a shame that a great number of people in the US are still turned off to series' like this before they even see them because of cliches like Pokemon or horribly executed (pun intended) dubs like Dragonball Z or Sailor Moon giving them the wrong impression of anime in general. No matter who you are, chances are there's a character or situation you can relate to, be it the calm and collected Spike, Faye Valentine, a woman who turns out to have a lot more substance than shows on her surface, or the oddball Ed (Edward Wong Hau Peppelu Tetivrusky the IVth...she named herself). Protagonists and antagonists alike exist in by far more dimensions than any characters in any US animation (be it on television or feature film)...you might even find yourself understanding the at-first seemingly heartless and bloodthirsty Vicious by Session 12 (Jupiter Jazz, part II). As if the base content of the anime wasn't good enough, Bandai has gone a step closer to perfection with an English dub that's simply awe-inspiring. The case with most anime today is still a case of the original Japanese dialogue and voice-acting completely crushing English dubbing of the same series, but Bebop is a rarity where the dub not only consistently matches the sub, but sometimes, dare I say it, even comes off as *better.* The dub voices sound just as natural and the acting in certain dramatic episodes (especially the last two Sessions) really makes the viewer feel the characters' emotions. Dramatic acting in LIVE-ACTION films rarely gets this good. I only wish this voice studio would get hired more for this kind of thing...perhaps then, the state of anime dubbing on average today wouldn't be so dismal. If you're an anime fan, get this series and watch it. And if you're not an anime fan, get this series and watch it, because after you do, you will be.

It is so tough to talk about this series and not give too much away.  Never have I seen so much detail, not only in animation, Yoko Kanno's soundtrack, sound effects, (even the firearms used in the series are all genuine in detail....trust me!!), but especially the character development.  Sure, every descent series shows some sort of inner conflict or hidden past in a character to keep things interesting - but never like this.  In truth, I almost wish I never learned as much about each character as I did, simply by watching all 6 disks.  Most of their backgrounds are so unpleasantly depressing that I found myself cringing alone with utter empathy.
I tried to sleep last night after the last disc, and wound up staying up all nights with my own thoughts on the story.  Even the music on the last disk during hte menu screen is different than the rest... its just that super haunting theme balad.  It is just THAT GOOD!!!!
I feel like this final critique is leaving out justice to the other series sessions that are less relevant to the overall plot.  Epidsodes like the ""Toys in the attic"" is totally scary!, ""Cowboy Andy,"" ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" etc.  And lets not leave out all of the Character episodes drawing us deeper into Jet's and especially Fay's super upsetting background.
My favorite episodes are clearly session 8 ""Waltz for Venus,"" and sessions 12 & 13, ""Jupiter Jazz parts 1 & 2""
I have tasted a very good share of Anime, and I am still not sure if this is my favorite of all time yet, (I may be saying this ONLY because I feel it's too fresh in my mind to crown ""favorite""), But Cowboy Bebop's overall production value encompasses every value you could find in an oscarworthy motion pitcture.
Let me cynically add however, that I find much distaste in the Acadamy's discresion in alloting film awards and remain very happy that Anime stays far away from that spotlite.  It wouldn't be fairly evaluated.
Cowboy Bebop is without a doubt the finest Anime ever produced.  If you haven't seen it yet..just do what I did and buy it.",995932800,,2241,4.535980148883374

I just can't praise this series enough - it has STYLE. The characters are awesome, the music rocks, the direction is occasionally breathtaking, and the animation is consistently wonderful. Another big plus with the series is the fact that the CG isn't really overused. It seems like a lot of anime thse days has scenes that just scream ""HEY LOOK! WE USED CG HERE! NEAT!"", whereas Bebop simply uses it to enhance space-travel scenes. The casino in episode 3 is a good example - it was just a nifty little touch. I occasionally hear people complain that Bebop doesn't have very developed characters, and I would like to take a stand against that claim. Just because you never hear what's going on in their heads thought out loud, as in most anime, doesn't mean you can't get to know them. My advice is to open your eyes to their quirks and really pay attention. Watch every episode a few times. I for one eventually got to the point where I felt almost like I'd been on the ship with them. Of course I didn't understand them totally. They're people. People don't make perfect sense. But they were very, very real to me. (LOL, I love this show too much to write a very coherent review, can you tell?)",995846400,,1533,4.2714776632302405
1069859,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is what an television series should be, entertaining. The story is of two bounty hunters named Spike, a man running from his violent past, and Spike, a former cop whom lost his arm in an accident, whom travel the through the universe in a bid to capture wanted fugitives. The animation is absolutly dazzling, some of the best I have ever seen. The music, writen by Yoko Kanno is absolutly incredible especially ""Ballad of the Fallen Angels"". Cowboy Bebop ranges from comedy, to film noir like mystery, and finnaly to John Woo like action quality. This first volume in the six DVD series contains five episodes, buying this is actually cheaper then buying the episodes on DVD. The picture quality is good on DVD but what really takes the gold is the spectacular sound quality that this DVD offers. This series is recomended to viewers 13+. While most episodes contain only mild violence and language there are certain episodes such as episode five ""Ballad of the Fallen Angels"" which contains a violence level that is seen only in John Woo films. This is a series for anyone whom wants a return to a retro fashion story of mystery, revenge, betrayal, and good old fashioned jazz.",995587200,7,1191,4.758454106280193

1069914,5,6305789312,"Often gritty, often funny, filled with memorable characters, and voiced with excellent voice actors in both japanese and the english dub, I would heartly recommend this series to anyone who wants to start out in anime to the serious otaku who has seen every type of anime available. It starts slow but soon gains headway as more characters are added, and new situations develop to challenge them all, culminating in a life or death battle for the main character, throughout the entire series, I was impressed with the style and grace of the animation, and storytelling, as well as the music (done by Yoko Kanno, who also did the music for macross plus.) a class act all the way, never feeling rushed, or cut short. the only real minus I can think about this series is that it ends after 26 episodes, after you get an emotional attachment to spike, jet, faye, ed, and ein. all deep enough character design to justly be a main character by themselves in any other type of media.

After that we meet good ol' Faye in episode 3. Then we meet Vicious in episode 5 and he is rather important to Spike's past. The Song GREENBIRD that is played during Spike's ""fall"" is the best song for a peek in his past and you can tell what he was in long ago, and that the blonde haired woman with Spike is also going to be important as well.",993427200,,686,4.204545454545454

A style that makes him seem like a futuristic cowboy (that's not supposed to sound goofy, alright?). The humor is great, and better than your average Japanese perv and angry girl humor. No, this humor is sharp and sarcastic. The animation is excellent as well, being surprisingly smooth for a TV show, especially at the occaisional battle scene.

Unlike evangelion, Bebop has little continuity in its plot, but that doesnt make it any less enjoyable.  The animation and characterisation sets a new standard for other anime. With their superb style and personalities, the characters are as real as they come, with great english dubbing, no cheesy lines,  no sillyness (well, apart from Ed - who is a kid) and great design. The 'cinematography' and artistic endevour of such episodes as 'jupiter jazz' rival film greats like kubrick. This is the most mature anime series for a long while, yet mature in a different way, not just needless sex, violence and swearing. It packs a punch in the action department too. The excellent animation, gunfights, CG, and great ship designs combine to produce many genuinely thrilling action scenes. The disc itself is great. 5 Episodes, excellent,crisp picture and good sound - the extras are a bit thin, but if you get the entire series (which you must!), you're left with a lot of bonus stuff to look at. It cost me about 120 to get the entire series, but its well worth it. I could say why its so great forever, but i'll just say that no other anime has gotten me as involved - emotionally and visually as cowboy bebop.",992044800,4,1304,4.616379310344827
1069918,5,6305789312,"I bought the first session of CowBoy Bebop based on the reviews here at amazon. And if i am completely honest then i must say that i found the first 2 episodes a bit weird at first, and i even wondered if i should get the second dvd. But then i  started to watch the third episode ""Honky Tonk Women"" and to my surprise the characters and story lines started to grow on me. After watching Episode 5 ""Balled of fallen Angels"" i must confess that i am now a big fan of the series. By now i am humming the Jazzy theme song and i am not even a big fan of jazz!
Cowboy Bebop despite the weird name is a very compelling anime that gets beter every time you see it. It has action, excitement,and the dark humor is excellent. If your looking for a new series then you can't go wrong with CowBoy Bebop.",991526400,,792,4.044585987261146
1069919,5,6305789312,"I am very skeptical when it comes to Japanimation.  I bought this on reviews alone; never hearing anything about the Bebop series from friends.  This anime is worth the money.  It has what I look for in Anime.  Great animation and well developed plots.  The music also flows with the story and has a sweeet jazz rift to it.  It could use a little more action, but with such a well developed plot, it didn't need it.  I found myself wanting more after watching the 5 episodes that are on the DVD. I was very suprised by the detailed character developement as well.  As each new episodes starts, it builds from the previous episodes seamlessly.
The only thing that I would want to see differently with this Anime is longer episodes.  I watched all 5 episodes in one sitting. The good thing is that it had me wanting more.",991353600,,819,4.442953020134228

Our heroes, Spike and Jet are two bounty hunters who are on the neverending quest to make a living.  Over these first five episodes Spike and Jet tangle with a drug smuggler who uses his rage inducing product to protect himself and his girlfriend; a thief who has stolen a strange mutt; the curvy thief Faye Valentine; eco-terrorists; and a menace from Spike's hidden past.  Excellent music by Yoko Kanno. Fantastic visuals, including some of the best use of CG and cel animation I've seen.  I recommend watching it subtitled, but the dub isn't bad.

Let's start with what's wrong with Bebop......
Now we'll list the Good points.....
1. the Story...Granted there are quite a bit of ""filler"" episodes, not as many as the Slayers series tho. BUT, even filler episodes are awesome, each one having a great theme.
2. the music...amazing, simply amazing!  there are currently 4 soundtracks available, get them. Yoko Kano is a genious, The music she wrote makes the series all that much better.
3. the Characters...the main characters are deep, each having subtle nuances, i promise you'll fall in love with Spike Spiegel, Faye Valentine, Jet Black, and Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th *whew*.  Even secondary characters are amazing....

1070040,4,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is, in this reviewer's opinion, the finest series that anime currently has to offer. The animation is top-notch, the writing is consistently excellent, the English voice work is amazingly good, and the soundtrack (provided by Yoko Kanno) is absolutely brilliant throughout the entire series. It's a pity that the series had such a short run-- what's available in these six DVD volumes constitutes the entire twenty-six episode series. Nevertheless, this is one series every anime fan must have, and a series I would also recommend to fans of TV shows such as Miami Vice.
  Cowboy Bebop's basic structure allows each episode to be a full-fledged story all its own, with the main characters-- Spike, Jett, Faye, and Edward-- serving to connect them all. While there is a consistency to the entire series outside of the characters-- mainly concerning each character's exploration of his/her identity-- this is a more episodic anime series than something such as Evangelion, and yet far less formulaic than Dragon Ball Z and its brethren. I cannot stress how incredibly good the writing is here-- each episode is a self-contained story full of integrity: sometimes dramatic, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but always effective each time without sacrificing any of the show's core values.
  Each DVD disc in this series is a bargain-- five episodes per disc for Volumes One and Two, and four episodes per disc thereafter. Extras are limited, but the video quality is outstanding, and both Japanese/English tracks are provided, with English subtitles. The English voice acting is very impressive--  dialogue is still intelligent following the translation, lip synching is dead-on, and the voice actors are almost as endearing as the characters they portray.
  The first volume of Cowboy Bebop is a bit slow compared to the rest but it is still the best place to start. Here, you'll get a great idea of what to expect from this series, and meet (almost) all of the main characters, as well. I highly recommend this disc, and keep in mind that if you enjoy it, the other discs in this series are even better.",990403200,,2114,5.022857142857143
1070041,5,6305789312,"Say what you want about Cowboy Bebop, one thing is certain: They're not afraid to take risk.  The creators did things their way and their way only, and the result?  A kick ... series that resembles nothing that I've ever seen, even if it contain bits and pieces of old cop-and-robbers shows.  From the funky name to the grumpy characters to the jazz infused musical score; nothing in Cowboy Bebop caters to the conventional viewers.
 The characters?  They are grouchy blue-collar guys/gals with few resemblances to your innocent teeny winy prince/princes.  The action?  Nothing over the top, and rarely does it shows an explosive scene without a good reason for it.  The plot? Generally directionless; there is no magically balls to collect, no priceless treasure to steal, no indestructible giant robots to combat, and no sexy & barely clad girls to rescue.  The animation?  Excellent graphics, heavy on details, and camera angles that would inspire Orson Welles.  The editing?  Crisp, stylish, but remains low-key and never draw attention to its superb animation.
 CB features your typical good guys catching bad guys scenarios, but where many of such shows failed, even non-anime ones (""Millennium"", ""The Profiler"", etc.), CB succeeded by being wittier, funnier, having better editing, better characters, better scripts, and never pretentious or self-indulgence.  The chase scenes are usually done light-heartedly.  The bad guys are bad but always with legitimate reasons and their personas are well developed.  Above all, the characters in CB are multi-dimensional and surprisingly realistic, even by non-anime standard.
 Is Cowboy Bebop perfect?  No, but it's very close.  It starts off slowly and ends too soon (my opinion of course).  There is little continuity from one episode to the next and it doesn't grab your attention from the very first episode (like a Eva series would).  The story development in CB is slow and laid-back, even if the action and pace is usually fast and rapid.  You won't get hooked by watching the first three or four episodes; but once you're into it, it's hard to stop watching.  I like it cuz I am sick of those pretentious, over-the-top, lame-dialogs shows where the characters have less personality than pieces of wood.  CB is breath of fresh air.  Maybe there is still hope in the cops-and-robbers ( or bounty hunters-and-robbers) genre.",990403200,,2378,5.14621409921671
1070042,5,6305789312,"When I first sat down to watch ""Cowboy Bebop"" I really didn't know what to expect. Many of the reviews here at Amazon.com say that this is one of the greatest anime series out there today. I found this very hard to believe considering some of the other choices out there: Trigun, Tenchi Muyo, Slayers, Dragonball. Those are some very good series in and of themselves and I found it hard to fathom that another series could be considered, hands down, to be the best out there.
After watching the first two episodes on the DVD, I found that I really didn't understand the story very well and the characters were a little foggy. Thankfully, this was quickly cleared up as I continued watching. The characters are slowly, but smoothly developed and I didn't find myself having to ask very many questions on why someone was doing something. By the end of the DVD, I felt as if I'd grown up with Spike and Jet and I began to look for their tell-tale quirks. Overall, the story and characters are pretty average (so far) for an anime series and they don't break any new ground. At the same time, however, they make it entertaining to watch.
The soundtrack and imagery is definitely not average. It is far, far above average. This series contains, quite possibly, the greatest soundtrack I've ever heard... Outweighing even some Hollywood films! Meanwhile, the imagery used in some of the scenes is outstanding. This includes a breathtaking cathedral scene in episode 5 and an awesome hyperspace chase scene in episode 4. When both of these aspects are paired, you'll be floored by it.
In conclusion, I can't really label any anime series as my ""favorite"". Trigun is great to watch when I'm in the mood for goofy humor or excellent character development. Dragonball is great for watching exciting action. But, when I'm in the mood for intense imagery and a great concept, Cowboy Bebop is definitely the way to go.",990316800,,1905,4.706586826347305

In these episodes we are introduced to characters such as Spike (the main character) and faye valentine. The first few episodes are nice but nothing out of this world, the main reason i would reccomend buying this dvd is for episode 5 which from my point of view is a masterpiece, the story and animation in this episode are the some of the best in the series.

The characters have much more to them that is slowly revealed throughout the series, however.

The only thing that some viewers may experience problems with is its very fast pace. Usually in many animes i know the pace is nice and slow so it can be detailed and u don't have to try to figure out everything and try to get into the storyline in like every episode. Like for example Dragon Ball Z doesnt change its saga every 1 or 2 episodes. But this anime changes its plot and setting like every 1 or 2 episodes and when it does that there is a new main villain every episode, a new goal every episode, and a new setting every episode.
If you can understand what is going on very quickly and like to have most of the details changed rapidly then you may like this but i suggest it only to people who quickly understand whats going on and that have a fast enough brain to keep up with this.
Putting all that stuff aside the only thing i can say is...
THIS IS A KICK A$$ ANIME AND IF YOU ARE TOO IMPATIENT TO STAND SERIAL EXPERIMENTS LAIN AND DONT LIKE TO WAIT A LONG TIME FOR A VILLAIN TO FINALLY GET DEFEATED OR SOMETHING INTERESTING TO HAPPEN THEN YOU MUST HAVE THIS YOU WILL LOVE IT JUST LIKE I DID!",989020800,,1263,4.076305220883534

Drama and humor.  This series has it all.  It has been a long time since I saw anything that I enjoyed so much-- in any medium of entertainment.  A series which takes cliches and turns them in unexpected ways.
However, a word of warning.  Due to Violence and Profanity, parents should be cautious before allowing minors to view it.  The average episode seems to require a minimum age of 15+.  Three episodes (5, 25 and 26) contain the equivalent of R-rated violence",985219200,,776,4.7593984962406015

Because Cowboy Bebop is probably the most ""mature"" of all the anime series' on the market right now. When I say mature I do not mean the kind of mature with age restrictions and those nasty demons with their dirty tentacles. I mean mature in the fact that the stories are well rounded and funny and interesting well after the first time seeing them.
These first four episodes do not deal at all with any silly kid stuff (thank the lord!) And there are no precocious and pretentious little girls in suits with magical powers who spend five minutes of every episode in a still frame while yelling some childish invocation. Well, at least Ed doesn't come along for another couple of DVD's anyway.
This series is all about action, the blues, jazz, and good stories. And at last, an attempt at irony, which is something the eastern world still has trouble with in most anime series.
If you don't own any of these and own other anime like Dragonball Zzzzzzzz or Sailor Yawn oh I mean Moon... check this out. You will not regret it.
To sum up:  Great animation with very few of the old standby still frame .... Excellent story telling where things from past episodes aren't just part of the backdrop forever and characters change. Good music. I never thought I would say this about an anime series, but you'll be humming the theme song when you drive once you hear it. It's not ... Mario Brothers type techno for once... it's the blues and Jazz! Hallelujah! All in all the best anime series I have seen to date.  Thank you, Japan.",984355200,,1604,4.433898305084746

They have taken established genres aand/or styles and managed to create a fresh and compelling tale of bounty hunters in the year 2071.  This show has it all. Complex characters, great stories, creative traditional art and nice use of CG, wonderful music the list goes on. This is also a show that gives it viewers credit and doesn't have to explain every stupid plot detail and back story of its main characters, Spike,Jet, Faye, Ed and even Ein the data Dog. It allows the viewer to make his or her own theories behind the story arcs many interesting twists and turns. All the while the show is presented in a  laid back breezy kind of tone, in sharp contrast to its awesome kinetic action sequences.  The crew of the Beebop will grow on you as they are very human, and present a great contrast to the sometimes cold technology that exists in their world. Just when u think you have a charcter pegged down in this show they surprise you in some way. The writing in this show is top notch by any standards. And if their is an unsung cast member it is the dead on soundtrach by Yoko Kanno. Some parts jazz,some rock, some blues, the music will stay with well after you have watched all the episodes.  All in all, with a fresh visual design, great storylines, super music and an offbeat yet familiar feel to it, Beebop is a great TV show period.  This is better than most LIVE-ACTION tv series. But then again it truly showcases why anime is so great and US animation is SO limited. Even the Dub is better than the original Japanese track (trust me on this, just compaare!) If your not hooked by the end of session 1, please check your pulse.  And remember its actaully cheaper to buy anime on DVD in the States so their is NO excuse not to get this great series. The hairs on the back of my neck still rise up when i see Spike fight Asimov in ""Asteroid Blues"" OH bOY! and oh yeah the Cowboy in the tile refers to Bounty Hunters and Beebop is the free form style of Jazz pioneered by Charlie ""Bird"" Parker (for you younger ppl out there) it important to remember this....",983750400,,2141,4.4213197969543145

I was looking for some new anime that was fresh and funky, so I did some research into Bebop and what it was all about, what was everyone raving over. I checked out a few websites and from what I saw I was curious enough to invest in the first 3 sessions on DVD.
I cannot recommend this enough. I was slightly put off when I heard it was a tv series, but after the first episode I was awestruck by a series which was very fresh and funky. It has a great sense of humour, quite dry but very cool. To date I have only watched the dubbed version, it has great dialogue, and the characters a fun and groovy. The animation is smooth and fluid.
The premise is of a pair of Bounty Hunters who travel the universe capturing villains and having other people join the crew of their spaceship The Bebop. Each episode is fully laden with great music which complements the story so well you almost wonder why no-one else thought of this for anime.
All in all, you need to try it out and watch at least the first few episodes. Any fan of Anime will be instantly pleased. This is Hip, Cool and Groovy.",983145600,,1161,4.164444444444444

The sound is the only place where I think Bandai didn't do it justice. Its in your minor Dolby 2.0 with no surround sound making the voices sound so quiet that you have to turn up the volume (not that I don't mind cranking up the volume during some of the gun fights). The Extras on this disc is the part where the DVD really shines. It contians a music video of Tank!, the full version, featuring scenes of some of the greatest moments in Bebop. Even more, the DVD also contains a Character Info video that was on Cowboy Bebop Session #0 in Japan. It was kinda fun to see.

The antagonist in this series I think if I remember correctly may be introduced in the second DVD who is named Vicious.  Who was once Spike's companion in a big crime organization.
Spike and team are often with no cash and ever-searching for food.  At the first go in the series a plot-line wasn't so obvious, but if you know what to look for it is easier.  Spike used to be a part of a crime organization that Jet as a cop used to fight against.  Three years previously Spike left.

1070201,5,6305789312,"Once every few years comes an anime that blows away the competition. Once every few years perfection is set. Although many argue which are classics, we can't deny that some series'/movies are undoubtedly far above the competition. I can name a few that have reached stellar heights: Akira, Macross, Ghost in the Shell, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Pokemon, Princess Mononoke... and Cowboy Bebop.
Cowboy Bebop is a short series, and although most episodes are self-contained (making it easier for anyone to join in the action at any time) there is a larger story that slowly unravels itself. This hidden, sad story is about Spike, a bounty hunter's, past life. Along with Jet and Faye Valentine (in Session 1), fellow bounty hunters, the three travel the stars in search of wealth. Session 1 is a great introduction to the series and contains 5 excellent episodes. Perhaps the best episode is number five, because it begins to reveal Spike's dark past.
The music of Cowboy Bebop is among the best of Yoko Kanno's (Macross Plus, Vision of Escaflowne) works, and is mostly jazzy and blues. In fact, the whole series can be seen as a monument to this type of music. Everything from the opening theme song ""Tank!"" to the ending ""Real Folk Blues"" is one great composition after another that really sets the mood.
The DVD includes the first 5 episodes of Cowboy Bebop as well as the full-length opening theme ""Tank!"" (with scenes from the series to accompany it). Character Information is provided as a video (part of Session 0, or Episode 0, that aired in Japan). Four trailers (Outlaw Star, Brain Powerd, Blue Submarine No. 6, and Silent Mobius) are also on the disk. And, as usual, Japanese and English tracks are available (with optional English subtitles). All of this is topped off by beautiful Dolby Surround (Digital) and packed in one nice disk. Enjoy!",976320000,7,1850,4.876190476190477
1070202,5,6305789312,"If you have a home theater system, crank it up. Though the 5.1 encoding leaves a bit to be desired, the stereo feed is good enough, especially with the subwoofer kicking in. As an owner of DVD discs 1-5, I have not been dissapointed. There are only six DVD discs, and no other TV episodes planned, but a feature is supposedly in the works.
The stories are well written, from the poignent, ""Speak Like A Child"" (DVD session 4) (Was I actually a bit weepy at the end??!?), to the wonderfully strange ""Pierrot Le Fou"" (DVD session 5) and silly, trippy ""Mushroom Samba"" and ""Alien"" take-off of ""Toys in the Attic"", this series never lets you down. Just like with the X-Files, some episodes are like 'conspiracy' episodes in that they focus on the characters pasts, which you may actually find interesting because the characters themselves are interesting. (There really are only three characters, ""Jet"", ""Faye"" and our here ""Spike"". ""Ed"" is there for comic relief and ""Ein"" is a dog...) Other epidodes focus on the profession of the BeBop crew which is ""Bounty-hunting"".
I especially like the way logic in the series isn't contradicted. IE: a fact created in one episode still holds true in later episodes. Some episodes are funny, some action packed, others are slow and melow. The chartacter development is great. The music is great. The stories are great.
Sink your teeth into disc one and then buy the rest.

1070275,4,6305789312,"Well, it was inevitable that anime would become the next big thing.  After creatively bankrupting traditional American animation techniques, it was only a matter of time before something bigger and better came along (not necessarily ""new"").  If you're like me, most anime that you run across is dismal, insipid and takes a tremendous knowledge of backstory before you even watch one episode (even THAT'S hard to do considering there's so many different incarnations of every anime).  Anime has been around a long time and has only recently come to be the ""next big thing"".  Unfortunately, much of it really isn't that interesting but once in a great while one comes along that's actually worth paying attention to.  This is where Cowboy Bebop comes in. Fairly easy to get into, the episodes move along at such a pace that each is enjoyable and most stand alone (only a handful connect to each other and even then it's not necessary to have seen the episode that preceeds it).  Full of interesting concepts, dry wit, complex characters and even a bit of slapstick, the crew of Bebop try hard to entertain and, most often, succeed.  The only downside is that the episodes tend to go from one extreme to the next (one episode is played for laughs while the next is purely drama; sometimes it's a letdown).  Also a bonus is the fact that the female characters are not reduced to vapid, irritating whiners who seem to lose their clothes at the most inopportune moments (those of you who know anime, know what I'm talking about).  They actually have brains and a personality, a rare commodity in many an anime.  The music as well deserves recognition.  Composed by Yoko Kanno, her versatility is heard throughout many of her works ranging from Bebop Jazz to Ska influence to old fashioned Bluegrass.  Her work is undeniably brilliant and is a welcome change from the usual electronica scores of most anime.  All in all a well-rounded anime that deserves the hype lamented upon it.",972345600,4,1974,4.804733727810651

A lot of the time, the stuff that gets to America is just plain weird: unnatural acts with tentacles, schoolgirls acting like vamps, and then there's that whole have-sex-and-explode thing.  Cowboy Bebop will turn you right back around.
This series is smart, sexy, sassy, and tons of fun.  The production values are excellent; art is beautiful, animation is silky smooth where it needs to be.  And the music!  It's no wonder people buy the soundtrack to Bebop; the music runs the gamut from country harmonica to power pop ballads with a bit of classical and jazz thrown in.  The stories are quick and self-contained, and the plot, believe it or not, makes sense!
Whether you're an old hat at anime or new to you, I think you will enjoy Cowboy Bebop.  This series shows off what anime can do that regular movies can't: the action scenes are wild and frenetic, and the spacescapes are broad and beautiful.

1070278,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is the best anime TV series I have seen.  The only  unfortunate thing about it is its name, and that's only bad because it  might put off potential viewers (actually, the blurb on the back cover is  pretty bad, too).  Cowboy Bebop sports terrific animation quality  (including computer generated images which are much better integrated into  the style of the cel animation than just about anything out there),  interesting character designs, a great English dub, and terrific writing.  Unlike most sci-fi TV or movies, Cowboy Bebop has a well thought-out world,  where a fact learned in one episode is not blatantly contradicted in  another.  More importantly, Cowboy Bebop puts this world to use: out of the  five episodes on this DVD, there are action episodes, comedic episodes, and  a (rather action-packed) look at the past of main character, Spike.
I can  think of only two reasons why someone would not like Cowboy Bebop: if  you're unwilling to take animation seriously, this isn't the show for you,  and if you demand a continuous plotline which runs throughout the show,  Cowboy Bebop doesn't have that.  Not that Cowboy Bebop is purely episodic;  it is held together by the well-maintained world, where actions in past  episodes have repercussions throughout, and by the pasts of the characters,  which haunt them.

I also enjoyed  the well-done combat sequences, be they either martial arts or the  gunfights.  I also liked the added comic tones in some of these fights.  They were well drawn and fluid, and were fully detailed, not like the  annoying 'still frame of combat with sound tactic' I have seen is some of  late.

And each segment fits well with  the others, but can be taken alone (unlike other anime series like  Evangelion).
The DVD contains five episodes from the series.
  ""Asteroid Blues"" starts off the series with a bang.  We meet  Spike and Jet, two space-bound bounty hunters, aboard their spaceship the  ""Bebop.""  Asimov Solinsen is their first bounty, but who is  hunting whom?
  In ""Stray Dog Strut"" a notorious animal  snatcher has swiped a dog (named Ein) from an experimental lab.  Sure he's  cute, but what is the REAL story with this dog?
  ""Honky Tonk  Women"" finds Jet and Spike in a Casino in space.  Trying run up what  little cash they have left, they run into Faye Valentine.  She's a gambler  with millions in debt, recently shanghai'd into a scheme involving a  special poker chip.
  In ""Gateway Shuffle"" Spike and Jet run  into Faye again (who now inducts herself into the ""gang"").  Some  eco-terrorists are bent on saving the Ganamede Sea Rat... They'll make  monkeys out of anyone in their way.
  The last episode on this disc is  ""Ballad of the Fallen Angels.""  This episode is more audibly set  to music than the others, and gives us a glimpse into Spike's past.  But,  it seems, more questions pop up in this glimpse, than are answered.
Each  of the episodes have wonderful music in the background. (Listen to the tune  during the first dog-chase in ""Stray Dog Strut""!  I was humming  that one for DAYS!!)  Thanks to Dolby Digital, you can enjoy the music and  sound effects in crystal-clear surround sound.
The DVD includes English  and Japanese language tracks and optional subtitles.  You'll also find  character introductions and a full-length music video of the show's title  song ""Tank!""
If you are fan of Sci-Fi or anime, you NEED to own  this one!",960249600,11,2318,4.607940446650124

That said, COWBOY BEBOP is pretty close to being ultra cool  (with opening graphics and music  rivaling that of GUNSMITH CATS in  greatness) and it looks REALLY GREAT for a TV series... even high end  recent series seldom look this good consistently through entire episodes.  Terrific characters and great design (both mechs and people) and a funky  beat (both aural and visual) round out the highpoints of this particular  DVD.
However, so far (only five episodes) the series has yet to live up  to either its potential or its reputation with press and fans.  It is  nearly regarded as a modern legend in stature.  Perhaps it is but it has  yet to bear this out for me.
The main problem is there is a slightness to  the stories (excepting the tremendously poetic fifth episode) so far and a  severe lack of logic in the way events bear out and people behave (at least  it appears that way to me.)
But damn it sure looks good (and episode  five seems to point to greater things to come.)  Besides, it has Faye  Valentine who is the coolest anime babe since LUPIN III's Fujiko (indded  BEEBOP could be viewed as a SF reworking of LUPIN in spirit) and the  coolest TV babe this side of Emma Peel.
So, BEEBOP is pretty much a must  for anime fans and a good bet for non fans (particularly those into SF and  retro intrigue type shows) to check out.  It has yet to hook me but I'll  certainly be back for more.
Before I go, a reference to some prior  comments by other reviewers:  The Japanese subtitling (under songs) is  offered as a service to Anime Fans (Fandom as a unit) who are interested in  both the english translation and the original lyrics;  and the title COWBOY  BEBOP is pretty cool, not embarassing.  OK, that's my deal.  Go check it  out.",959558400,,1914,4.392550143266476
1070371,5,6305789312,"Cowboy Bebop is a series of two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who fly around the galaxy in their ship called the Bebop. Along the way they tackle drug crazed lunatics, a basketball player sized pet thief, corrupt casino  operators, a gorgeous card shark, a maniacal green peace leader, and a  syndicate turn coat with a violent streak longer than the grand canyon. And  that's just on the first disk. This is the sort of thing that Quentin  Tarantino would produce if the cartoon network ever gave him a thirty  minute slot. For example, we've got fairly slick dialogue, a cool range of  characters, and a jazzy soundtrack that goes even further in outlying Yoko  Kanno's talents as a composer(Macross Plus, Vision of Escaflowne, Brain  Powered, etc). The animation isn't bad either. The combination of both CGI  and conventional animation is done so well, that it doesn't appear to  clash, bringing to life a spectacular universe. A top quality series.",959040000,3,954,4.90625

get it. samarai shamploo is another excellent series.

realize these are adult anime, so has some scenes maybe not so appropriate for kids. kids grow up eventually though. why hide the real world from them when that is what they are going to be living in for most of their life?",1384819200,,485,4.438202247191011

7894436,5,6305789312,"In 2071, man has colonized many of the planets in our solar system. People from all walks of life roam free. Violence, freedom, love, hate, and every other aspect of human nature is rampant across the galaxy. Those that capture wanted criminals are called cowboys(bounty hunters). Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and their dog, Ein are the top bounty hunters in the solar system. They all have different pasts, different reasons for being partners, and different fates awaiting them. As their pasts come back to haunt them, can they survive and keep their friendship strong, while at the same time making a living catching bad guys?

Cowboy Bebop is an anime legend. It's probably one of the best ever. I don't know if it makes my top 10 list or anything, but it's darn close, and a must see for any anime fan, or fan of super cool action shows. This series has great animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot. The story has a very methodical nature. Most of the episodes are about them chasing different bad guys. There are a few that link together as a continuous story, especially toward the end, but it's a show that can keep your attention by changing the mood frequently. I can't say enough good stuff about this series. It's definitely a favorite of anime fans across the globe. You can't miss Cowboy Bebop.",1353974400,,1312,4.7043478260869565

The audio takes full advantage of a 5.1 surround system. That being said, if you don't have 5.1 and you already own a prior release, you probably shouldn't bother as the picture, while much better than the perfect session's release, seems to be the same as the original dvd releases. But if you do have 5.1 or you don't own any of this amazing series, then you need this.",1200787200,,526,4.27
