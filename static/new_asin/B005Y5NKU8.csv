8489083,4,B005Y5NKU8,"Jorge drives a Taxi in Bogota. His brother has recently been murdered and he is both grieving and aching for justice. Then a gang member tells him he will tell him who the guilty party is at a prearranged rendezvous, but he already knows and is hell bent on revenge but is not sure how to do it.

Then fate intervenes when an unwanted fare and `firecracker', as the sleeve note puts it, crosses his path and becomes an unlikely partner in a night long trawl through the high lights and low life's of night time Colombia.

This is one of those films where it looks and feels real. Where when people get hit they are actually hurt and can't just bounce back into superhero mode. It is the sort of film where guns fire too high and people are way too fallible. Angela (Gloria Montoya) the female angel here is brilliant as the girl with a past who wants to run away from reality in a haze of drugs and booze. Jorge (Quique Mendoza) comes across as guilt ridden and scared and all too fragile in a truly excellent performance. The film has an air of violence throughout which maintains the unease at levels that go all the way up to eleven (thanks `Spinal Tap'). This is like holding your breath hoping the pain will go away and is mightily effective.

I am a big fan of World cinema and South America does not often get the credit it deserves - this one from 2009 should have reached a much wider audience and as such I would urge you to spoil yourself and give it a go.",1428969600,,1467,4.26978417266187
