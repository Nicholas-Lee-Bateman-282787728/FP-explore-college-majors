1921427,5,B0000DA23M,"I just had the pleasure of seeing an advance copy of this set, and it is terrific!  Like this company's other ""Ultimate Sets"" for Johnny Carson and Bob Hope, this is a very deluxe, collectable 3-DVD set in beautiful packaging, with around 9 hours of the Sonny and Cher hour.  It had been a long time since I had seen the show, and I was suprised at how much fun it was - (as long as you enjoy lot of campy and sometimes silly comedy, a bevy of Sonny ""short jokes"", and Cher doing some of her greatest songs in incredible outfits).  There was a chemistry between Sonny and Cher that I had forgotten about that was really interesting to see - since the departed Sonny was usually just the butt of jokes.  The shows also featured a lot of guests - with perhaps the most interesting being a young Michael Jackson and his brothers, and Cher and Tina Turner doing a duet (dueling Divas!). The set also had a lot of interesting extras - including commentary by Cher that was recorded this summer.  The extra ""greatest hits"" CD was also terrific - with many of their best songs from the 70's.",1064880000,11,1084,4.346534653465347

1921460,5,B0000DA23M,"SONNY & CHER-THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION: Back in the good ol' 70s, when the beloved TV variety show was still king, only one program offered any serious competition to high water mark music/comedy showcase THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW. That was the two and only SONNY & CHER, a hit making couple who patterned their trademark put down schtick after loud, stumpy Las Vegas bandleader LOUIS PRIMA & his cooly detached chanteuse wife KEELY SMITH. THE SONNY & CHER COMEDY HOUR was a zany, colorful mind-meld of slapstick skits, bad puns, and sultry, BOB MACKIE-inspired fashion-plate perfomances by CHER of chart-toppin' sagas like GYPSIES, TRAMPS & THIEVES, HALF BREED, and DARK LADY. Regular funny features included VAMP, which spotlighted infamous women throughout history, SONNY'S PIZZARIA, and CHER as tacky, gum-chomping gossip Laverne, the Leader of the Laundromat. Guest stars ranging from DON KNOTTS and RUTH BUZZI to RONALD REAGON and the JACKSON 5 were supported by a large cast of regular zanies, notably TED ZIEGLER, BILLY VAN, and the perfectly lovely TERI GARR. The fun was infectious and the mega-watt charisma of the show's two stars undeniable; SONNY & CHER was a kitschy time capsule worth tuning into during the ""me decade"".

1921470,3,B0000DA23M,"Sonny and Cher, review of DVD box set

First let me list the highlights of each disc:

1st disc
Harvey Korman, and brief appearance by Carol O'Connor.
A very handsome Burt Renyolds, and look for a young Steve Martin (thick hair, sporting beard and mustache).  Martin's primary function is writer (he's in the credits), but he has some screen time here.
Merv Griffin

2nd disc - best of the three
Jackson 5 performs ""Lookin' Through The Window""
(too bad they didn't perform one of their big hits)
Michael performs ""Ben""
Michael has brief conversation with S & C
Ronald Reagan
Teri Garr
Howard Cosell
George Foreman  (I own his grill and it's great!)
Chuck Connors
Danny Thomas
Ken Berry
Chastity  (S & C's toddler)
Miss USA
Miss Universe  (she looks very average to me)

3rd disc
1969 Pilot and other extras
Donny and Marie  (she's majorly cute!)
Ruth Buzzi
Alex Karras
Farah Fawcett
Don Knotts
Glen Campbell
Tina Turner

As a previous poster mentioned, these discs should NOT have consisted of entire episodes!  Should include the best segments from the show's entire run, and it's absurd that the discs were not orchestrated that way.  Had these discs been created properly, I probably would have given 4 stars instead of 3.

Much of the humor is dated, and to be blunt, too much of it wasn't funny the first time around.  Still, this series shines as a great time capsule of 70's American culture.  Cher dons a plethora of lavish costumes, some of which are very odd, but she always looks great.  The show's writing is uneven, but Cher's delivery is usually right on.  Sonny is, well, Sonny.  Actually, he has some shining moments, but he's dwarfed (literally and figuratively!) by Cher.

Without Sonny and Cher's singing ability, they would have never been offered a TV show.  Yet when the two of them stand next to each other and sing, they look stiff and awkward, like teenagers giving their first school performance.  Cher, via her later commentary, refers to Sonny and herself in one of the early episodes as ""wooden.""

In light of Michael Jackson's untimely passing, I'm interested in vintage Jackson 5 footage.  After MJ's demise, Cher told Larry King that the J5 had never been on the Sonny and Cher show, only on her solo Cher show.  Obviously, she is mistaken, because the J5 is here.

In closing, most people should derive some enjoyment from this set, but keep expectations in check.",1249689600,18,2397,4.745762711864407
1921471,4,B0000DA23M,"When I was a child, I loved this show.  I worshipped Cher and tried to dress and sing like her.
Watching the show now as an adult 30 something years later is interesting.  The humor is very dated. There are alot of groaners.
But its fun to see the costumes and see people who weren't famous yet, like Steve Martin, in the skits.
I wish it came with a booklet though that told you who was in each episode and some info about it.
All in all it is well worth the money for a trip down memory lane.",1233187200,,494,3.9797979797979797

1921473,3,B0000DA23M,"I never realized how dated this variety show could be in its entirety.  Carol Burnette had the right idea... Splice the BEST parts into 1/2 hour shows.  Parts of these shows are really good but not entirely so.  Cher's comments run about 5 minutes.

1921482,4,B0000DA23M,"Good stuff. Some of the skits go on too long, but I enjoyed seeing the two of them together again. Although, it's unfortunate that the episodes are not in stereo. The musical numbers suffer because of this.

Cher's commentary on Discs 1 and 2 are about 23 minutes each, and only 8 minutes in length on Disc 3. I liked them all, even though they only totalled less than an hour in length.

Also of note, are two producer commentary tracks that are about 18 minutes each. I liked them as well.

In addition, here are the songs Sonny and Cher sing on the Barbara McNair show (17 minutes worth, and yes, the show is in color):

-""What Now My Love""

-""Danny Boy"" (extra slow, boring version-sung by Cher)

-Medley: ""The Beat Goes On""; ""All I Really Wanna Do""; ""Sing C'est La Vie""(or whatever it's called?); ""Babe"" (1 minute long) and then once again ""The Beat Goes On"".

1921485,5,B0000DA23M,"As far as I'm concerned, these two set the bar for the slew of variety shows that followed in the 70's (though I'm well aware there were predecessors).  Their opening song and banter were always entertaining.  The skits were actually funny (most of the time) and who didn't love the medley portion of the show (complete with matching outfits and Sonny busting out some lame dance moves). They had really good writers, regulars (including Steve Martin and Teri Garr), great guest stars, and groovy clothes that put the Brady Bunch to shame.  Little Chastity closed out the show with them, and it was just a nice little, sweet family (little did we know).

However, as an elementary aged child at the time, I had an odd crush on Sonny Bono (which to this day I will never live down with the family).  I get a big kick out of watching this 70's time capsule (and call me crazy, but I still thik Sonny was a cute little guy). My only complaint is that they didn't put the show out in individual seasons.  I realize it's hard to get the rights to the music, but I'd love to at least see the 1st three seasons in their entirety....I can do without the post divorce show (though the skits were funny--it didn't gel).

I would entertain my family doing impressions of her singing (and yes, I can still sound like her LOL) from Dark Lady to Gypsies, Tramps, ad Theives and the opening monologue.

Some of the comedy is out of date, but some of the comedy is still terrific. However, if you were a TV viewer in the early 1970's this collection will bring back lots of great memories of one of the best variety shows of the period. This was all before SNL began. You can see the seeds of SNL in this variety show. All of this and great music. Wow!",1111968000,,507,4.08

I cannot understand the reasoning behind the selection of shows included in this collection.  The comedy sketches are decidedly NOT funny, given the passage of time and the change in popular tastes on the comedic scene.  What would have been far preferable, would have been to have included ALL musical numbers performed by Sonny and Cher, and also by Cher alone.  Ultimately this duo will be remembered for their music, not their comedy.  Hopefully the creators of this DVD set will put out another collection of just the music...PLEASE!!",1101772800,7,689,4.896551724137931
1921495,5,B0000DA23M,"When I think of early 70s pop culture, nothing embodies and virtually SCREAMS the early 70s for me as much as this show. During an era when variety shows ruled, this one has always been the king of them for me, and I've dreamt of owning episodes like this for 30 years now. This set does not disappoint and really delivers the goods.
One of the very best things about it is that you get FULL and unreedited episodes, exactly the way they were broadcast, right down to those memorable animated sequences with the ball-creature at the commercial breaks. BRAVO to the people who brought us this DVD collection for giving us exactly what we wanted!
Looking at this show again for the first time in 30 years, it seems even sillier and schmaltzier than I remembered. Younger folks raised only on Saturday Night Live might find it hard to appreciate, and it's significant that this show's initial run ended in 1974, just a year before the debut of SNL. I feel it symbolizes the end one of one era in comedy and the beginning of another. What we have here is humour in the old-school, high camp Vaudevillian tradition.
Yes, some of the jokes are downright groan-worthy, and for anyone else this show might have flopped, but what makes it work here is the undeniable talent, charisma and charm of -- and chemistry between -- Sonny & Cher, who I consider one of the great couples of the 20th century. Sure the jokes are silly, but here are two people just literally having the time of their lives making this show, and their enthusiasm and enjoyment is infectious.
The guest list on these shows is a star-studded who's-who of 70s pop culture including Burt Reynolds, Howard Cosell and even Ronald Reagan from the early 70s and Donny & Marie and Farah Fawcett-Majors from the later 70s. And I'll bet today's young'uns will have a hard time recognizing a very young Michael Jackson as he performs with his brothers the Jackson 5 and on his very first solo hit ""Ben"".
Disc 1 gives us 3 episodes from the first season, while Disc 2 gives us 1 episode from the second and 2 episodes from the third season. Funnyman Ted Ziegler (what ever happened to him?), a young Terri Garr and Steve Martin (before his hair went grey and still sporting a hippie beard!), and Canada's own late great Billy Van (fresh from Hilarious House of Frightenstein) round out the gags.
The best thing for me was seeing that great ol' cheesy weekly V-A-M-P sketch that I've carried fond memories of in my head all these years again. And in the third season Cher introduces her greatest character of all, Laverne the laundromat lady. (Can somebody please explain what a ""yenta"" is?)
Disc 3 features 3 episodes from their short-lived reunion series from 1976-77 (after divorcing and each having separate variety shows of their own). The show gets off to a rough start due to the absence of producers Blye & Beard. The first episode is pretty terrible, but don't give up on this second series and keep right on going to the second and third shows on this disc. They get better. One has a priceless sketch with Cher and Don Knotts which shows Cher at her naughtiest, cheekiest best. All I can say is, this lady must be some~ fun for any man to be with!
The 2003 commentary by Cher is brief, but we really gain some insight into what interests her, as we hear all about the costumes she wore, little tidbits about Sonny, and even why she seemed to lose her eyebrows for a while. Great stuff!
The interview with the producers is also good, although they come off as a little smug. But hey, I guess if they could make a show which has stayed as close to my heart as this one has for the past 30 years, they deserve to be a little proud.
""But wait, that's not all..."" I don't know what mouldy old vault they dug this out of, but an amazing bonus treasure for Sonny & Cher fans here is a 20-minute segment of them on the long-forgotten 1969 Barbara McNair Show. The picture is crystal clear and looks like it was just made today. It gives us a good idea of what their lounge act must have been like in the 60s, and the segment ends in a great medley with a cookin' version of ""The Beat Goes On"" featuring classic Question Mark & the Mysterians-type 60s organ in the background. Groovy~!
You also get videos for Cher's 70s solo mega-hits like ""Half-Breed"" and ""Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves"", Sonny & Cher karaoke, and the extra audio CD that comes with this is just pure icing on the cake, baby. This set would easily have been worth the price even without it.
This show was such a part of my life in the early 70s that looking at it again is like seeing old movies of long-lost relatives who used to come over each week for a visit with their little family. -- And then suddenly they were gone... never to reappear on my TV screen again... Until now!! I have to confess that seeing Sonny & Cher with Chastity at the end of their show again brought a little lump to my throat. I have REALLY, really missed you, guys...
I really hope that the people who made this set will keep releasing the rest of the episodes of this fantastic series on DVD. I want them all!!! And I also hope to someday see on DVD both Sonny and Cher's solo series, as well as the 5 episodes of the summer replacement series they did before this show that they mention in the intro of the first episode on disc 1 here.
To any Sonny & Cher fan, I say ""Buy this set. You won't be disappointed!""",1076284800,95,5411,4.4174174174174174

The shows have of course the great Sonny & Cher, along with guest stars like Carroll O'Connor, Merv Griffin, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, and many more!

There are great musical numbers from the day sung by Sonny & Cher and their guest stars  as  well as performances of many of Sonny & Cher's and Cher's big hits.
There are also extensive bonus features included with the DVD set and a bonus CD, both a great addition to an already great collection!",1070755200,8,839,4.6938775510204085

1921500,5,B0000DA23M,"I am thrilled to finally have great episodes of the Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour available on DVD! I loved these shows as a child and thirty years later they are still funny, charming and full of great musical numbers! How lucky we are to have this set available!
  This collection includes nine complete episodes (six from the original run of the Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and three from their reunited run on The Sonny & Cher Show).
  Laverne at the Launderette, Raggedy Sonny and Raggedy Cher, and the classic V-A-M-P segments are just a few of the great regular series features represented in this collection. Just a partial list of guest stars includes: Don Knotts, Farrah Fawcett-Majors, Tina Turner, then Gov. Ronald Reagan, Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5, Carroll O'Connor and Glenn Campbell. There are many great musical numbers by the weekly guests and of course Sonny and Cher! Many Sonny & Cher hits and Cher's solo hits are spotlighted in this collection, including: ""All I Ever Need Is You"",""Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves"", ""The Way of Love"", ""A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done"", ""Half-Breed"", ""Dark Lady"", ""The Beat Goes On"", and ""I Got You Babe"".
  Each show's opening segment was a bright musical duet from Sonny and Cher and always included one of their famous dialogue exchanges. The openers to each of these shows are priceless and remind me of just how much I love The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and how happy I am to be able to view it again!
This collection also contains a great amount of bonus material highlighted by audio commentary (on select segments) by Cher. This commentary was recorded in August of 2003 and is a wonderful addition to the collection. Recent interviews with the shows producers, and Sonny & Cher's 1969 pilot spot on the Barbara McNair Show, are just two of the other great segments included in the bonus material.
  The visual and audio quality of ""The Sonny & Cher Ultimate Collection"" is outstanding! I hope this is the first of many editions!",1068249600,119,1983,4.727536231884058
1921501,5,B0000DA23M,"Only one word can be used to describe this boxed set: MAGNIFICENT! For once, a company gets the fact that fans want to watch episodes of their favorite TV shows EXACTLY the way they originally aired. They even included the original pilot! These episodes are uncut and include the original animated opening credits (remember the S&C egg cracking open?) as well as the animated station break bumpers (these are the kinds of things that usually get discarded from DVD releases, but what this collector ultimately wants to see included). The quality of the episodes is top-knotch. Obviously they spent a great deal of time and care in restoring these episodes. I believe the originals were taped, not filmed and sometimes tape doesn't hold up over time. THESE DO!! Cher's commentary is fun to listen to also. It's so cool to hear her talk of these ""old days"" with affection -- unlike other stars who seem to have an attitude everytime you mention their TV past. I haven't seen this show since it first aired, and watching these episodes was like stepping through a time warp to Wednesday nights. I definitely recommend this boxed set! I amy even check out their other releases too. If they did such a good job with Sonny & Cher, their Johnny Carson and Bob Hope collections must be cool too.",1068249600,20,1287,4.724444444444444

This collection does not have the guest artist performances - sadly they did not buy the rights.  But it is nonetheless entertaining.  Like a few other reviewers wrote when I purchased this collection I couldn't wait to open it, watch it and recapture a more innocent time.  However, it was just really silly and rather stupid.  I really wanted to recapture that feeling, instead I was bored and didn't even finish watching it.  However, I am glad I have this collection and would buy it again.
