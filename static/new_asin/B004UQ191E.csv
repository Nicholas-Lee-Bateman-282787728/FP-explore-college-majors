on extraneous cute crap that got put in to satisfy some guy's ego.  They made a nice neat efficient movie that was
interesting.",1522627200,,237,4.682926829268292
8441994,5,B004UQ191E,"Awesome movie! In Hindi I'd like to say ""Bade dino ke baad ek badhiya Hindi thriller dekhne ko mila!"" which when translated means ""After a long long time, I got to see a great Hindi/Bollywood thriller!"". The suspense was very well maintained and little would the viewer know what he is getting into in this movie. Suffice it to say that one must pay careful attention to the opening scenes and the lines spoken when all the main characters get together for the first time. Anything else said about this movie would be a crime in itself. Just see it.",1516147200,,549,4.5

ABHISHEK GET'S HIS ""GAME"" ON.  TOP drawer all the way. Pleasing cinematography, fight sequences that use a lot of old school common sense in the filming ; no jerking the camera around during the  scenes beyond what is needed (a pet peeve of mine) . The travel log worthy visuals and dialogue you can follow are just cream on the cake. A naughty ""Cabaret"" dance scene that is definitely NOT FOR KIDDIES. We're talking fishnets and leather imagery with suggestive poses not bump dancing.  Bought This one  from KHAN'S STORE SUPPLIED BY AMAZON. NO PROBLEMS SO FAR.

I will just state that the essentials are as follows : four people who are all in desperate situations are sent letters each with it's own enticement for that individual . They are all told to show up on the same day on a billionaires private island. The big reveal style show down in the dining room and the next day big dramatic moment....

  The Director delivers.  There's no sitting around on the island for five days waiting to have tea with old ladies pontificating on their navel lint. You are a suspect and instead you are trying to lose a vigilant IVS surveillance team  . The director wisely uses the chase scenes to show you some excellent scenery of Istanbul . I can't believe Abhi made it up that hill man ; I would of been in the hospital by then with my heart attack. He's pretty good at evasion. Leading people around to make them see what he wants seen.

The only flaw for me was in the very beginnings fight scene where Abi turns the lights off. It's hard to see that one scene. Turn the brightness up higher and don't blink or you'll miss some Bourne Identity fight moves. The rest of the scenes are well lit.

 You've maybe guessed some or all of the plot depending on your who done it skills and yet you are hoping it's nowhere near done as you are having too much FUN watching Abhishek kicking ass and getting his vengeance on. Excellent bluesy music numbers used throughout. Nice artistry to the opening and in the end a video in similar style with the stars dancing. EXCELLENT WORK YOU ROCKED IT ABHISHEK..LET'S DO IT AGAIN MAN..",1336089600,,2249,4.5209876543209875
8441998,4,B004UQ191E,"Four strangers invited to a remote Greek island, four strangers due a comeuppance. Abhishek Bachchan heads a strong cast in GAME, a slick Bollywood thriller laced with elements of the whodunit. Like most Bollywood pictures, GAME is constructed in two parts. In the first half, the reclusive tycoon Kabir Malhotra (Anupam Kher) requests the presence of these four strangers just when they require sanctuary the most. Thailand's shady Prime Minister candidate, O.P. Ramsay (Boman Irani), is frantic to escape the media's damning questions. Boozy crime journalist Tisha Khanna (Shahana Goswami) was just bailed out of prison for drunk driving. Casino owner and cool customer Neil Menon (Bachchan) is on the run from Columbian drug lords. And famous actor Vikram Kapoor (Jimmy Shergill) is hiding a corpse in his luggage. Kabir Malhotra's letter to each guest extends a lucrative proposition. But, of course, he has something entirely different in mind. Somewhere, Agatha Christie is smirking.

****POSSIBLY SOME SPOILERS NOW****

On his private island, Malhotra unveils his true motivations. In this or that way, these four strangers are somehow linked to the death of his daughter (Sarah Jane Dias), and this enraged father means to mete out retribution. As such, he informs his guests that, come morning, police authorities will arrive to collect Malhotra's compiled evidence which implicate three of them. The fourth one, the crime journalist, is revealed, to her shock, as the fraternal twin sister of Malhotra's deceased daughter, Maya. Her resentment marks her as a suspect for what happens next.

You haven't been around the block if you can't guess what happens next. The next morning finds Kabir Malhotra dead at his desk, his brains blown out by his own hand. Or that's what the first impression would suggest. Chief Investigating Officer Sia Agnihotri (Kangana Ranaut) of the IVS (International Vigilance Squad) doesn't buy it. Something's nagging at her. Forced to release all the suspects, she sanctions a surveillance ops on the four strangers who've scattered across the globe back to their homes. She lavishes particular attention on the clever, unflappable Neil Menon. She remarks to her aide: ""It's not over."" And on the motorboat rapidly pulling away from the isle, Neil Menon echoes her sentiment. The film's second half tracks Sia Agnihotri's near obssessive investigation of the four, despite her supervisor's repeated orders to back off.

****END OF SPOILERS****

Maybe Abhishek's wife can give Sarah Jane Dias a few dancing lessons? Dias is fine as the tragic figure around which the plot revolves. This is her film debut, her what used to be Miss India of 2007. And, given, she isn't given much to do but look waifish, and she is objectified for most of the film. But she makes the most of it; her presence anchors the plot. Given Bollywood's tendency to inject a musical number anytime, anywhere in the movie, Dias does need to brush up on her bust-a-move skills. As far as the tracks themselves go, I'm really digging the title song ""It's a Game"" and the wicked club banger ""Kaun Hai Ajnabi"" and will probably download them soon. GAME marks Abhinay Deo's directorial debut, him what used to be an advertisement director. Credit him and the cinematographer for staging the sets in vivid ways. GAME looks beautiful and makes good use of its exotic locales (Mumbai, Bangkok, Istanbul, London, the Greek island). You can't dismiss the film's technical strength.

Nor can you overlook the cast's solid performances. I thought that Anupam Kher as the vengeance-minded billionaire and Abhishek were particularly good. GAME has several exciting action sequences in which Abhishek's character employs martial arts, and it's fun to watch Abhishek lay down moments of sheer assskickery. Abhishek exudes an elegance and a palpable craftiness. You get the sense that from the minute he landed on the island his character right away had begun putting the pieces together. The only fault lies in Abhishek's jogging which even Steven Seagal - whose hands limply flop around when he runs - says looks funny. Besides, the sequence in which Abhishek jogs in Istanbul - while pursued rather obviously by IVS agents - takes too long to arrive at its payoff.

It's a taut thriller and there are some nice twists. But there's a bone to pick if you're a mystery buff. Regarding the murder-solving, the film doesn't really play fair with the audience. The clues are supposed to have been there from the start, so that we, too, can have a stab at the killer's identity. Instead what we get are late reveals and introductions of new characters late in the game. There is also the logic hole in the murder itself. How the investigative officers were able to determine that the death was murder instead of suicide is pretty neat, if not exactly new or inventive. The problem is that the killer is someone who's known the victim long enough to not make such a bonehead mistake in framing the suicide in the manner (s)he did. Somewhere, Agatha Christie is muttering in disgust. So, as an entertaining thriller... definitely. But as a credible whodunit? Not as much. But I still recommend it because I had an incredibly good time watching it.

This DVD also comes with a comprehensive 42-minute ""Making of the Film"" featurette which is mostly in English.",1327276800,,5346,5.04643261608154
