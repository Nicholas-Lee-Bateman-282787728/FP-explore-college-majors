7470637,5,B016COIV6M,I was a Extra in the Original Pilot Playing a Venezalan Soccer Player. I was payed Scale but it was a lot of fun. I taped the Original Pilot off of cable a few years ago.,1268006400,4,170,3.75
7470638,2,B016COIV6M,"CBS, who owned the rights on the pilot refused to come to an arrangement for its usage on this DVD set! Therefore Mill Creek Entertainment has been forced to NOT include it on the DVD. All other episodes will be there. CBS has succeeded in making me as mad as hell. Its a 30 year old program being released to a budget-priced DVD! What do they care anymore?! So the pilot, which explains what you need to know about the show, is gone. There is a man on youtube, user id chuckcollins, who is planning on posting the pilot that he has from an old recording. So I guess for the price you could watch the pilot on youtube then enjoy the rest. Its what I plan to do, but I'm mad at CBS for screwing this up for everybody",1264723200,99,715,4.114285714285714
7470639,5,B016COIV6M,"Tenspeed and Brown Shoe was a short lived series in the early 1980's. The chemistry between ""detectives"" Ben Vereen and Jeff Goldblum is not only extremely humorous, but also over the top, amazing acting. I remember looking forward to wathing the show each week and how disappointed I was when the network tanked it!
It was as good or better than Police Squad and it's about time it's coming to DVD!

7470640,5,B016COIV6M,"This series was shown in my region of Britain in a ridiculous lunchtime slot, as 'filler.' As a result whenever I have mentioned it to people over the years, I get a glazed look in their eyes, and the question: 'Tenspeed & what?'

I seem to recall a senior US network executive called the introductory film the best 'pilot' he'd ever seen; I caught the second half of the pilot and was instantly  hooked.

For the following few weeks I used to cycle home from school, watch the show and then cycle back late, ditching Physical Education class. (It's ok, I turned out alright).

It ended too soon but sometimes - when a show is cancelled - we can at least treasure it as something, which didn't run too long and eventually go off the boil...

The Tenspeed character resurfaced years later in the show JJ Starbuck, which has so far not been shown in Britain. I hope that gets released too.

UPDATE May 2014: The Pilot Film is now available in English on the German full series release ""Die Schnuffler"" BUT the French release ""Timide & Sans Complexe"" has no English language option so be careful. The German release even has the original soundtrack music, not the slightly amended synthesized version on the US release.",1261353600,37,1216,4.606481481481482
7470641,4,B016COIV6M,"When you think of popular TV from the 70's, 80's and early 90's the work of Stephen J. Cannell will usually come to mind.  Creator of many iconic series such as The Rockford Files, The A-Team, The Greatest American Hero, and many others including this lesser known gem.  I was in college when Tenspeed and Brown Shoe premiered in 1980 and only saw a few episodes but thought it was pretty amusing.  When this DVD came available it was too good to pass up (DESPITE not including the pilot which is annoying to say the least).  A very young Jeff Goldblum is straight shooter accountant Lionel Whitney who reads noir detective fiction and longs to be like his hero Mark Savage PI.  E.L. Turner played by Ben Vereen is a con artist parolee who joins up with Whitney to form a detective agency.  The unlikely duo bumble their way through various cases and by today's standards it pretty cheesy but still fun.  There are only 12 episodes included since the two part pilot as previously mentioned is not included due to CBS supposedly still having the rights and not wanting to release the 30+ year old show which they cancelled after one short season...why?  There are no bonus features whatsoever.  Also, the music by composers Pete Carpenter and Mike Post who gave us many memorable TV themes (such as The Rockford Files) while catchy seems mismatched for the subject matter.  The score relies on heavy banjo and harmonica music that would be more at home on The Dukes of Hazard and not for a show about LA detectives, a minor flaw.  Overall this was a lighthearted trip back to time before all the poor reality fare we're served up nowadays and television attempted to be a diversion.",1456185600,3,1681,4.626262626262626

7470656,5,B016COIV6M,"I remember liking this show when it was on, and it was fun to watch again.  The production was a little less sophisticated than current shows, but for this particular series it worked well.  The situations have enough humor and intrigue to keep you engaged.

Along with others, I would love to have the pilot episode, but I knew it wasn't included before I purchased it.

In case anyone from Hollywood is reading, I think it would be great to see Jeff Goldblum and Ben Vereen in a  movie about the Lionel Whitney agency 30 years later...  :)  With Brown Shoe a little more jaded over the years, but still a little naive, and a mellowed, but still cunning Tenspeed conning his way through a caper.

But I digress...

In short, I think this series is well worth purchasing.",1358380800,2,771,4.489208633093525
7470657,5,B016COIV6M,"This is a great show.  Pity the pilot is unavailable, but the shows are funnier even than I had recalled--Goldblum and Vereen are perfect for their roles and Stephen Cannell a wonderful writer!",1357084800,,193,4.848484848484849
7470658,5,B016COIV6M,"For fans of detective shows with humor like Rockford and most of Stephen Cannell shows this is a must have. This forgotten gem which
like many great shows got cancelled after only one season despite starting out with good ratings! Think of the crap in 80's that stayed on
TV for years! Cannell's writing was as good as Rockford episodes and these are done really well and fun to watch. Goldblum was terrific
in his first big TV role and would have become even better but Verren I think was the wrong choice as sidekick. He's okay at times but
he over acts and doesn't pull off the comedy as well as maybe Pryor or another comedian would have pulled off. He's no HUGGY BEAR!
But overall the show works well enough with Goldblum in the lead and his parts make the show anyway. I agree it's pathetic that the big
Hollyweird brass refused to let them put the Pilot episodes on this set to squeeze a few more bucks from fans of the show! But as of yet
they haven't released it as a movie or anything! where is it? It's on the German set! why? well I will find from another collection because
I'm not paying for another set and give more money to the Hollyweird pigs! But this is a must have for Cannell and Goldblum fans!",1341792000,,1216,4.291304347826087

However, when I received the DVD, I was disappointed to find that it did not include the ""pilot"" episode.

7470661,3,B016COIV6M,"I ordered this item thinking (for whatever reason) that it contained only the initial pilot which aired before the 12-episode TV series.  Instead, what this is, is the 12-episode TV series without the pilot.  So two radically different guys are suddenly working together with no explanation as to why or how they got together.  Thanks, CBS!  Wait, there's more.  The picture quality was never electronically upgraded (what do they care?) for the DVD, so of course the HD picture looks grainy.  Still more:  the three disks come in a large enough box, but are in 3 different black paper sleeves inside rather than being mounted on plastic spindles.  Really cheesy looking.  And of course Amazon's idea of packing is to include ""bubble bags"" only on top of the merchandise in the box they're shipping, which doesn't protect the bottom side.  The plastic spine to my DVD case (and paper underneath) were broken and torn (respectively) at the bottom.  I'm just going to order a blank 3-spindle case and try to fit the paper insert (repaired and taped) into it.  And in the meantime, I'm going to see if I can't watch my many-year-old VHS copy of the pilot so I can get the story into proper perspective.",1299888000,5,1199,4.739130434782608

7470663,5,B016COIV6M,"Stephen Cannell did this series just after Rockford files.  The style is clearly similar to others of the time, but the casting was brilliant.  Goldblum & Vereen have each had shining careers and this is where many first saw them.  I looked forward to seeing them screw up and get out of it every week and was shocked when it was cancelled.  These are selected episodes, so you don't get the progression, but it's great to see them again.",1294185600,,438,4.506329113924051
7470664,4,B016COIV6M,"...before buying and about the fact that the original pilot episode was missing, even though some reviewers were kind enough to summarize the missing episode, even though I would buy the (complete) missing episode if I could...

Nothing made up for the intense frustration- and anger- I still feel that the set is NOT complete and THE MOST IMPORTANT EPISODE was missing. The charm is the quirkiness of the two disparate characters, but you'll never find out how they actually got together, the specific meaning of their signature handshake and there are no flashbacks to when they met, etc.

Yes, seeing a very young Jeff Goldblum was worth it. Knowing that someone sabotaged the set, just to be spiteful, bothered me more than I thought it would.",1285113600,3,747,4.874015748031496

7470666,5,B016COIV6M,I had totally forgotten this show and how charming it was. This DVD is a fun trip down memory lane to the careers of 2 terrific actors and Stephen Cannell's writing.,1277424000,,165,4.354838709677419
7470667,3,B016COIV6M,"Prolific writer/producer Stephen J. Cannell, had numerous TV hits during the 70's, one of the most successful being The Rockford Files, chronicling the adventures of private investigator Jim Rockford.  The series, Ritchie Brockelman, Private Investigator, was a spinoff from The Rockord Files in 1978, but the show only lasted a few episodes.  In 1980, Cannell tried the P.I. route again, with Tenspeed and Brownshoe, a comedy/adventure series featuring LA based private investigators Lionel Whitney (Jeff Goldblum) and E.L. ""Tenspeed"" Turner (Ben Vereen).  The tall, lanky, bug-eyed, stuttering Goldblum, and Vereen, the slick-talking, overly dramatic, man with a thousand smooth dance moves, make a pretty amusing team.  With each bringing something different to the Whitney Detective Agency, the partnership is a study in contrast.

Lionel Whitney is a trenchcoat wearing, green Triumph TR7 driving, ex-accountant type who left the financial world to become a private detective, hoping to find the kind of romance and adventure, he reads about in pulp detective novels.  A running gag, was that Whitney was constantly reading `Mark Savage' mysteries, books written by Stephen J. Cannell, that displayed the bearded author's picture on the back cover.  As he reads aloud passages from these books, Whitney fantasized about living the life of the fictional detective, Mark Savage.  Almost completely out of his element, the nave, idealistic, and soft-hearted Whitney, was often getting mixed up in questionable cases, where he would often be played for a fool.  Fortunately his skills as a black belt karate practitioner, proved to be a major asset.

E.L. Turner is a street smart, fast-talking, con man type, who is on parole.  Preferring to avoid or talk his way out of trouble, Turner is a quick improviser, and is adept at assuming identities, and using disguises.  Despite his shady tendencies, Turner's activities are mostly of a mildly illegal nature.  His knowledge of human nature, and the streets, proves invaluable in helping to solve cases, although his checked past sometimes complicates them.

With Cannell writing many of the scripts, the stories have offbeat elements and quirky characters, similar to The Rockford Files.  Whitney and Turner, do not have the glib smoothness of a Jim Rockford, so they have to go about things a little differently, and their lack of smoothness is part of the comedy.  Give these guys credit for independence though, for unlike many TV detectives, the Whitney Detective Agency, does not have a buddy on the police force to help them out.  And they are rarely bailed out, by having the cops appear just in the nick of time.  Mike Post and Pete Carpenter, who did the music for The Rockford Files, and several other Cannell series, provide the music for Tenspeed and Brown Shoe.  The results, are very similar to Rockford.  Some of the music works, but country influenced cues, with harmonica and banjo, that may have suited Jim Rockford, don't always play that well here.  The series features guest stars that appeared in other Cannell series, like Dana Wynter, Elaine Heilveil, James Whitmore Jr., John Hillerman, Rene Auberjonois, Larry Manetti, Red West, Jack Garner, and Richard Romanus.

The packing for the three disc set is very economical, featuring discs in paper sleeves.  Image quality of the episodes, is fair to below average, with some bad looking shading, and odd colors at times.  Sound quality is average.  There are no subtitles, or bonus features.  Fourteen one hour episodes were produced, but only twelve are included the set.  The two part series pilot, unfortunately is not included, but the low price still makes the set an attractive buy.

The series had a moderately strong, midseason debut in January 1980, but fell in the ratings, and was not renewed.  It is lightly recommended to those who like their detectives a little goofy, but definitely recommended to fans of the two engaging stars.  Multitalented Ben Vereen, who at the time was probably most known for his work in productions like Pippin, and the TV miniseries Roots, is quite entertaining as the freewheeling E. L. Turner.  The series was an early break, in the career of a young Jeff Goldblum, who would later find success in films, like The Fly (1986) and the Jurassic Park films.",1272672000,9,4320,5.1373390557939915
7470668,1,B016COIV6M,Goldblum's character is preening and spastic.  Vereen's supposedly smooth cons are utterly unconvincing.  The plots and dialogue are terrible.  There are no laughs unless Gilligan's Island is your favorite show. And the music sucks too.,1270944000,,236,5.685714285714286
7470669,3,B016COIV6M,We enjoyed this old show - blast from the past - except it was missing the pilot episode so the season isn't really complete!,1270771200,5,125,4.25
7470670,3,B016COIV6M,"I remember first seeing this series many years ago! I enjoyed it way back then & wondered why it took these years to be released on dvd! So we geet the news that it will be released & everyone was happpy, placed their preorders & waited to receiv their boxset form Amazon! I received mine yesterday & quicky opened it! Only to find that inside the very sturdy casing, I found three paper enevelopes with a disc each inside! Carefully, I removed these discs one at a time & placed them in plastic disc holders which easily fit into the case. Since these were transparent, I began to read each disc as the case said all 12 episodes! 12 & not 13, where was the pilot??? Nowhere to be found!! What is the sense of claiming that the entire series will be released & the most important episode, in this case the pilot movie, is not included!!!! I understand that the television network responsible for airing the pilot could not come to an arrangement or an accomodation with Mill Creek Entertainment! There is alot of dust & print damage on each episode & the sound is acceptable, but the packaging & the exclusion of the pilot movie are two sore points for me!
Final Update:
This is the e-mail I received from Mill Creek Entertainment this morning 22nd March:
""The rights to the pilot are held by CBS and we are unable to include the pilot along with the twelve episodes.  At this time, there are no plans to release another version of this DVD set.""
So there you have it, one can only hope for the pilot to released somehow in the future, at this point in time, not by Mill Creek Entertainment!",1269043200,9,1591,4.41156462585034

8736287,5,B016COIV6M,"I remember when this show premiered. It was decidedly strange, with the innately strange Jeff Goldblum (whom I'd never seen) playing a martial-arts expert who loved reading noir novels penned by Stephen J Cannell (whose photo -- with him smoking a pipe) appeared on the back jacket). Why it flopped is hard to say. Perhaps it was the unfamiliarity of the (obviously contrived) situation, or simply that viewers couldn't tolerate a black male actor in a leading role. Whatever the reason, it was gone all too soon.

Cannell later recycled the idea -- a lawyer with an ex-con companion, who was under his legal supervision -- in what I call a 'white bread"" version, ""Hardcastle and McCormick"". That lasted a lot longer, but didn't produce any particularly memorable episodes. Perhaps Amazon's ability to churn out CD-R copies will encourage CBS to let the pilot episodes join them, as there will be a readily accessible market..

Complaint -- these are burned CD-R DVDs -- not the newer, essentially ""permanent"" disks.. That means they should be kept in a cool, dark place when not being played.",1528848000,,1093,4.934782608695652

Of course that would not have been possible today (By Today I Also Mean Pre 9-11 Late 1990's) but in the 1980's it might have been possible. See the movie Catch Me If You Can.
