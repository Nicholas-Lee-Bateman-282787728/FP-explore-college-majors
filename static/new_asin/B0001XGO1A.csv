8017917,4,B0001XGO1A,"I agree with the first reviewer on one point, anyway. Kim Yates does not get completely naked although she does goes topless wearing pasties (I hate those things). The first reviewer is wrong about the sex scenes, though. There are several and they are exceptionally imaginative. The guys are absolutely amazing.in their scenes. Where else but in a soft core flick will you see guys having sex  with their pants still on? In most of the scenes there is not even the suggestion of an unzipped fly.
  I think the guys in this flick were shy or something. The women, on the other hand, were anything but shy. They were perfectly willing to show off the goods and what goods they had!. Imagine a movie with the following actresses sharing screen time: Kim Yates, Lauren Hays, Amber Newman, Brandy Roderick, and Ashlyn Gere. Ashlyn was the sexiest of the bunch. It's a shame she made her money doing hardcore as she could have been a major star in the soft core trade. All the women in this movie were gorgeous. Pretend you're thumbing through an issue of ""Playboy""  (not ""Hustler"") and I promise you'll neither  be disappointed nor offended
  There's a lesson to be learned here. A soft core movie is far superior to the hardcore variety of flick because of the tease factor. When you watch hardcore it's like you're a voyeur at the gynecologist. You have to use your imagination when you watch a soft core movie whereas nothing is left to the imagination in a hard core flick. Now try to imagine yourself having sex with your pants on. Difficult, isn't it? Use your imagination buddy.",1440633600,,1581,4.645161290322581
8017918,2,B0001XGO1A,"First let me say that this movie has some very hot women in it that have good strip tease scenes,that being said I HATE THIS MOVIE!The reason that i am so angry with this film is the fact that the most beautiful woman on the planet Kim Yates does not even get nude in this thing. She is the strip tease class teacher and doesn't get nude! Are you friggen kidding me!!!If you have never seen the actress that im talking about let me describe her,she has big beautiful brown eyes,short blonde hair,natural breasts of medium size,milky white skin and long legs that go on forever. Kim Yates has starred in such movies as ""Dangerous invitation"",""Teach me tonight"",""Price of desire"" and many more. Kim Yates is different than most women in adult movies today because she has natural classic beauty that is extremely hard to come by these days. Most of the women in adult films today(softcore or hard)are covered from head to toe with tattoos and piercings and look like they came right off the street. Even a hot woman like Lauren Hays(who also stars in this movie) has a tattoo on her lower back,these kind of things make women look more like men and take away from thier natural beauty. Other than the fact that Kim Yates doesn't get nude or have sex in this movie i have to say that this thing sucks. The plot is about a group of women that are learning how to strip tease for thier lovers. They do a lot of sexy dancing in this thing but when it comes to the actual sex scenes this thing falls flat. The sex between the actors seems stiff and unnatural,almost every sex scene brings things to a screaching halt and never picks up enough steam to make it good. Even an attractive woman like lauren Hays getting down and dirty with Bobby Johnston can't save this movie from being boaring. If you do happen to get this movie make sure you get the UNRATED version,the R-rated version has all the sex taken out just like all R-rated softcore movies. If you get R-rated softcore movies you are not seeing the whole movie,ALWAYS GET UNRATED!",1186704000,,2033,4.4972972972972975
