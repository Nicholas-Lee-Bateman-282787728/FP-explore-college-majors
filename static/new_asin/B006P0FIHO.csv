8502477,4,B006P0FIHO,"I enjoyed this production, but not as much as I thought I would! It boasts quite a strong cast, with every member giving their all, with Michael Volle deserving a special mention, in fact it is hard to criticise the performance as there is no weak point in the cast or orchestra. I don't know what it is but it just does not sit properly for me, perhaps it is Vera Nemirovas or Daniel Richters designs, I just know that it does not match up to the 1997 Gramophone Award winning DVD from Glyndebourne with Christine Schfer in the title role.
I enjoyed Patricia Petibons depiction of Lulu, I found it more coquettish, if not sexy, than Schfer, especially in the first act, but I disagree with Arnold Whittall in his Gramophone review (A/12), who seems to point to her background in early music giving her too much vulnerability in the role. She is after all the only singer to have two different recordings of this wonderful work in the catalogue, although I do find this production to be better than her 2011 DG one from the Licieu under the baton of Michael Boder, although this is more to do with the less than ideal supporting cast.
I find the angst and the sheer darkness of this opera are to be found more in Graham Vicks production from Glyndebourne, which still remains as my first recommendation. Some may find the different approach of this new production preferable, but I found myself asking what would Berg think, and I believe he would recognise the wonderful Christine Schfer at Glyndebourne to be more in keeping with his vision for the opera!",1400544000,2,1557,4.584229390681004

WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE CAST IS ABOUT.
BEAUTIFUL SETS, MUSIC, VIDEO.

8502479,5,B006P0FIHO,"Please be aware that Opera News elected this Blu-ray Lulu as the best DVD - combining both the DVD and Blu-ray categories - of 2012, number one of their twelve top favorites. They described it as ""Picture Perfect"".",1358294400,3,214,4.657894736842105
8502480,4,B006P0FIHO,"If you're singing and playing the role of ""Lulu"", you need not just the talent, but a lot of moxie to play someone who's a party girl, a dancer, a murderer, and a prostitute.  And can also express just the right amount of ""crazy"", far beyond your average Lucia.  Patricia Petibon handles the task admirably with her singing, facial expressions, and yes, her body as she is not dressed for winter in most of this.  Also worthy of praise is Michael Volle as the exasperated Dr. Schon and the quietly menacing Jack The Ripper. This is from the Salzburg Festival, and thankfully they don't get too outrageous (the subject matter takes care of that), except for giving the patrons a bit of 3-D by playing the opening of the third act amongst the audience.  The stage settings are spare with the emphasis on the backdrops...particularly the striped curtain behind the ringmaster during the opening that could be used to calibrate your HDTV, it's that brilliant.  And you can't go wrong with the Vienna Philharmonic.  A worthwile program from Salzburg.",1331683200,18,1045,4.810055865921788
8502481,1,B006P0FIHO,"This blu-ray of Alban Berg's opera 'Lulu' promised to be very appealing. I am sure it would live up to that promise, if only the disc could be played. There is some flaw in the programming so that only one menu option appears: ""Scene Selections: Act"".  Pressing enter, play, arrow keys, or any other key on the remote, are all to no avail. There is no way to actually play the disc.",1331337600,4,382,4.305555555555555
