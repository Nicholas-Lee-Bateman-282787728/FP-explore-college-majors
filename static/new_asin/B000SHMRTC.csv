8246873,3,B000SHMRTC,"I had to give it at least 3 stars based soley on the fact that is is Rocky and Bullwinkle. I was very surpised to see this dollar DVD while I was standing in line at Wal-Mart. There are some goods and bads with this purchase:
The Good - It's only a dollar, and its Rocky and Bullwinkle.
The Bad - The video quality is very poor, and the audio goes in and out.

Final word: Its worth a dollar.",1187308800,,392,3.9
