8234755,5,B000Z5L8AQ,"My daughter has used this video multiple times to ""fine tune"" her handwriting. She can write all her letters, but her writing is consistently sloppy and difficult to read. She has watched and completed the video multiple times and has enjoyed it each time, with noted improvements in her writing abilities. By interjecting the drawing exercises (picture drawing) with the lessons, kids stay interested and have fun, plus remember what they have learned.",1203897600,2,453,5.219178082191781
8234756,5,B000Z5L8AQ,"It's great to see a product that recognizes the importance of working with your child to reinforce the exercises.  So many products rely heavily on entertainment to keep the kids interest and attention.  By showing you how to work with your child, the benefits go far beyond improving their handwriting skills.",1203638400,2,310,5.0588235294117645
8234757,5,B000Z5L8AQ,"This DVD was better than anticipated.  My wife is a teacher & found it very useful for school & of course our kids...It's broken down into 3 sections which fits perfectly for different levels of kids.  The DVD has helped our 2 kids, 4 & 7.  This is great for the 4yr old to learn how to write & the beginning steps (even goes over posture!) It has helped our 7yr old ""fine tune"" her letters & even write more legibly. In addition, we have passed it along to their school. Because of the format & excellent instructions & how it is easily laid out, it will be perfect for both their classes. We highly recommend this DVD as parents & as an educator.",1199318400,3,648,4.209677419354839
