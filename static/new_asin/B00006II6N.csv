1776578,4,B00006II6N,"I enjoy the content of this DVD a great deal. Unfortunately, this DVD set leaves off a valuable option available on last year's MICKEY MOUSE IN COLOR and SILLY SYMPHONY compilations--the ability to ""view all"" with a single command on the menu. Instead, viewers will have to manually choose each cartoon, one at a time. I hope that Disney will reconsider in determining the playback options in future short feature compilations.",1039046400,24,427,5.028169014084507
1776579,5,B00006II6N,"I am a fan of Goofy and am glad that they brought him back a few years ago with the Goofy Movie.  Disney had put him in hiatus for may years.  Now, they have released all of his cartoons in one DVD collection.  These are the originals with all of the child-like innocence that Goofy is remembered for.  I remember many of these from watching Wonderful World of Disney as a kid but many are new to me also.  Some of the educational films that featured Goofy are not in here probably because they don't fit with the theam of this collection.  Collectors may not like this ommision but most people shouldn't have a problem with it.  If you like Goofy then this collection is not to be missed.  Highly recommended.",1038960000,3,710,4.366412213740458
1776580,5,B00006II6N,"Here is a list of all forty-six Goofy cartoons--year by year--contained on this new Disney Treasures collection:
1939-""Goofy and Wilbur"" (Goofy's first official ""solo"" short)
1940-""Goofy's Glider"" (The first in the long-running ""How-to"" series)
1941-""Baggage Buster"", ""The Art of Skiing"", ""The Art of Self-Defense""
1942-""How to Play Baseball"", ""The Olympic Champ"", ""How to Swim"", ""How to Fish""
1943-""Victory Vehicles"" (Could have been released under the delayed ""Wartime Cartoons"" Disney Treasures collection)
1944-""How to Be a Sailor"", ""How to Play Golf"", ""How to Play Football""
1945-""Tiger Trouble"", ""African Diary"", ""Californy er Bust"", ""Hockey Homicide""
1946-""A Knight for a Day"", ""Double Dribble""
1947-""Foul Hunting""
1948-""They're Off"", ""The Big Wash""
1949-""Tennis Racquet"", ""Goofy Gymnastics""
1950-""Motor Mania"", ""Hold That Pose""
1951-""Lion Down"", ""Home Made Home"", ""Cold War"", ""Tomorrow We Diet"", ""Get Rich Quick"", ""Fathers Are People"", ""No Smoking""
1952-""Father's Lion"", ""Hello Aloha"", ""Man's Best Friend"", ""Two Gun Goofy"", ""Teachers Are People"", ""Two Weeks Vacation"", ""How to Be a Detective""
1953-""Father's Day Off"", ""For Whom the Bulls Toil"", ""Father's Weekend"", ""How to Dance"", ""How to Sleep"" (the last of the ""How-to"" series made for the big screen)
1961-""Aquamania""
Though this collection is ""The Complete Goofy"", it would have been nice to include the two cartoons Goofy did with Donald Duck (""No Sail"" and ""Crazy with the Heat"") in 1945 and '47, respectively (probably saved for a later Donald Duck collection in the DT series). Also, ""How to Ride a Horse"" and ""El Gaucho Goofy"" (taken from ""The Reluctant Dragon"" and ""Saludos Amigos"", respectively) were re-released in an animated short format in the 1950's, but are obviously unnecessary to include in this collection. Goofy also appeared in ""Freewayphobia"" and ""Freewayphobia #2"" (both in 1965) which also appears to not be included here (probably because these were educational films produced extensively during this time by the Disney company).
Many of the above-mentioned Goofy shorts contained controversial scenes that have been removed and/or altered by the Disney company in recent years. This collection is promising that they will all be uncut--so let's hope they will be seen the way they were originally seen if only for the historical context. Last year's ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color"" and ""Silly Symphonies"" collections lived up to that promise, though the ""Disneyland USA"" set had some perplexing cuts.
This collection is one of three exciting, new releases this December in the second wave of the continuing Disney Treasures series (and extremely limited edition--125,000 appearing to be made instead of the 150,000 last year). There were supposed to be four releases again this year, but the intended fourth (Disney Wartime Cartoons) was delayed for reasons--as of this writing--unexplained by host/compiler of the DT series, Leonard Maltin.
The other two releases for this year: ""Mickey Mouse in Black and White"", and ""Behind the Scenes at the Disney Studio.""",1030752000,186,3045,5.564655172413793
1776581,5,B00006II6N,"This was a gift for my sister, and she totally loved it since her fave Disney Character is in fact the Goof. AWESOME AWESOME!",1399852800,,125,4.25
1776582,4,B00006II6N,"This collection of Disney's ""Goofy-only"" cartoons might be somewhat a surprise for people who only know the cute and lovable style of Disney's feature long, classic movies. If you're a person who has seen Disney's 1930s and 1940s cartoons, then you're probably aware that there is the wilder and more anarchistic side to the Disney image and style, too. Especially so with this collection of nearly complete set of the Goofy cartoons.
Many of the cartoons of this double-DVD collection are zany parodies of different sports, presented as instructional ""How to do""-series (""How to golf"", ""How to ski"", ""How to swim"", etc.). The common view on Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s is that the crazy and anarchist Warner Bros ""Looney Tunes"" and the MGM Tex Avery-based cartoons are a complete antithesis to Disney's cartoons of the same age, only holds partially. Check out, for instance, ""Hockey Homicide"" or ""A Knight for a Day"", both on this collection, and you understand what I mean. One can see similarity and a continuing thread from these cartoons to the MAD-magazine parodies of the 1950s, or the later crazy movie humor of the ""Naked Gun"" series. Definitely worth of buying for anyone who's got interest in the superb art and history of American animated cartoons.",1382486400,,1291,5.0093023255813955

1776584,5,B00006II6N,"Walt Disney Treasures second release of Wave 2 is devoted to one of Disney's most beloved and famous characters Goofy. Goofy first appears in an early Mickey Mouse cartoon called Mickey's Revue in which ""The Goof"" as the animators referred to him was nothing more than a background character hayseed although he already had his signature laugh, he would later be called Dippy Dawg before becoming a star in his own right as Goofy.

Goofy went through a few changes with his cartoons, at one time Pinto Colvig the creator of the distinctive voice of the character had a falling out with Walt and left to work for a rival studio. This left one of Disney's top dogs without a voice. Disney ingeniously made shorts that used a narrator to voice over Goofy doing pantomime ""how to"" cartoons that were funny and successful...although the idea wore thin after a while, they did use voice clips from older cartoons featuring Colvig's voice and when that was not an option they did use some other voice actors who tried to imitate the original, but the imitators never got it right.

The first disc includes 22 Goofy shorts which can be viewed in alphabetical or chronological order, but once again 'no play' all option??! This is a little irritating as it grows tiresome to have to go back to the menu after each cartoon. The good news is the shorts look great with vivid colors and excellent transfers. Besides the shorts we get a stills gallery and a short feature on the voice of Goofy Pinto Colvig. The second disc has another feature on the new voice of Goofy Bill farmer, more stills galleries etc. and another 24 Goofy shorts. There seems to be a few missing from this ""complete"" set? Some of these are available in other Disney releases, but there really is no excuse for this. Once again Disney falls short of a perfect rating by always leaving something to be desired.

Now I am sharing them with the next generation, and having even more fun the second time around. I purchased the Complete Goofy a while back, and have been very pleased with the product as a whole.

While it's true that the intro's by Leonard Maltin can be somewhat annoying, he is easily bypassed with a click of the button, and I enjoy having the option of hearing him sometimes bring more scope and background to what went on behind the scenes. A play-all feature would have been nice as well, but this is easily overlooked by a true Goofy fan like myself. I gave this one five stars.",1275523200,,709,4.453846153846154

GOOFY has Stared in 76 colored shorts in total from 1935-1965
Below is a complete list of all his appearnces. it comes in 4 collumns: first the episode number, then the date, then the official clasification of the series it comes under, then the title.

All Episodes clasified as Mickey Mouse are seen in both volumes of Mickey Mouse In Living Color, Any clasified as Donald and Goofy are seen in the donald Duck collection which you can check out the same details of on both donald duck dvds on amazon in my reviews.

The Goofy DVD has all 46 classified as Goofy.

the only 2 Goofy cartoons upto the 1960's that are still not available and have no furture treasure that are due out which could include them are his very last 2 original cartoons made in 1965 classified as Educational, which I think is why their not on his DVD being their not clasified as Goofy, nor are they part of any other disney series on the other treasures.

ANY OTHER CARTOONS STARRING GOOFY OTHER THAN THE LIST BELOW
were either theatrical movies, plus movies that were shorts combine when originally released which you can get on DVD now such as Mellody Time which are all classified as part of disney's masterpiece collection, but their is one movie with a goofy short not classified as disney masters which is THE RELUCTANT DRAGON, you can get the reluctant dragon on the disney treasures volume of: BEHIND THE SCENES which includes the short of HOW TO RIDE A HORSE. Or TV series and Specials made in the modern age which are not part of the treasures really. but below is a complete list of all his original production golden age shorts.

but I have to say, another Goofy cartoon famous to all Goofy fans not included in the Treasures: SPORT GOOFY IN SOCCERMANIA, it has not been released at all in the USA, but has on the UK Edition of Extreme Sports Fun,also it includes How To Ride A Horse, which means if you just want the goofy short and not the whole Reluctant Dragon Movie you can get 2 goofy shorts on this one UK DVD that are missing from Goofy's Treasure whicg just leaves his two educational shorts from the 60's left to find or hope a DVD to be released with and; you can get on amazon UK, as long as your TV is less than 5 years old it will have pal playback and aslong as your DVD Machine is multi region or free code then you will be able to play the UK DVD no matter what.

1776600,5,B00006II6N,"Goofy in my opinion is the funniest Disney character of them all. I've kept watching these cartoons on recorded VHS tapes when I was a kid and now they're completely warned out. Now after some time, realizing Goofy's on DVD, I managed to pick a copy of this up on Ebay and BOY WAS I FREAKING HAPPY!

46 cartoons are on this set (noticible omission: HOW TO RIDE A HORSE) and are no stinkers whatsoever. In fact, HOCKEY HOMICIDE, CALIFORN'YER BUST, NO SMOKING, TOMORROW WE DIET, and the ""HOW TO"" shorts are the best of them all. I laughed my ass off during all of these.

The extras are also solid. On disc one we have two documentaries. The first one is ""The Essential Goof"" which talks about Goofy was drawn. The second one was ""Pinto Clovig: The Man Behind the Goof""--Historian Leonard Maltin talks about what roles did Pinto Clovig play in, and what shocked me was that he played as Sleepy and Grumpy in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and Gabby in the 1939 film ""Gulliver's Travels"".

On disc two we have Leonard Maltin interviewing Bill Farmer, who has been voicing Goofy for the past two decades. This is very interesting interview. Finally, all that's left are rare poster and image galleries from the vault.

So what are you waiting for? ONLY 125,000 COPIES MADE! IT'S FRIGGIN' COLLECTIBLE!",1105833600,3,1299,4.6103896103896105

In ""The Complete Goofy,"" 46 cartoons that we've grown up watching are available once again, including ones like ""Victory Vehicles,"" ""Californy 'er Bust,"" and ""Father's Day Off"" that pre-date the politically-correct generation in which we now live. Leonard Maltin has a short introduction preceeding any cartoons that one may find offensive, but most people would be very excited to allow their young children to watch ""the Goof"" give instructions on various sports, tackle a tiger or a lion, and try to impress his son.
For us adults too young to remember when cartoons shown in the movie theaters was a usual occurance, but too old to enjoy many of today's modern cartoons, this collection is amazing and provides many extra bits of trivia we may not have known before. Did you know that the original voice of Goofy left Disney early in the character's development, so a speechless Goofy appeared in many ""How to"" shorts while a replacement actor was found? Did you know that Goofy's signature ""holler"" -- so recognizable by any Disney fan today -- began as a yodler making a hilarious mistake which Disney decided was too funny to re-record?
All in all, this collection is PERFECT for parents and children to sit down together and enjoy. My 4-year-old son and I have watched it through many, many times.",1084838400,5,1468,4.852589641434263

I would think most adults would like the ""Play it all"" option as well.  For that reason this will get less play time in our house than the other Disney Treasures since I have to be there to advance each cartoon.

1776606,2,B00006II6N,"Contrary to most of the reviews here, I find the 'Goofy' DVD to be lightyears behind the animation and beauty of many other cartoons.  While I would give the Mickey Mouse DVD's 5-stars, I only give Goofy's DVD 2 stars as most of his cartoons are quite frankly, boring and repetitive.  The Goofy DVD starts out in top form with its best cartoon (Goofy & Wilbur) followed by two strong (and earlier) cartoons.  After that, it's all a downhill slide.  The 'How To...' cartoons are extremely repetitive in nature and continuously use the same gags and gag lines.  Most of the Goofy cartoons would be 'ok' if sandwiched in with various other (non-Goofy) cartoons, but one 'How To...' after another is enough to lull you to sleep in no time.  Hey, maybe that's another idea for a new Goofy ""How to...'cartoon.  'How to stay awake.'  Of course, if they follow the normal 'How to...' forumla, it will be the same as the Goofy cartoon issued in 1953...'How to Sleep'.  But by then, you won't know if you are awake or asleep...",1064188800,6,1017,4.574585635359116

1776613,5,B00006II6N,"Down in the dumps?  Need to laugh?  This set is perfect for you.  Goofy is sure to bring a smile to your face and will provide a laugh or two as well.
Featuring 46 animated shorts from Goofy's solo cartoon career, there's something on here for everyone's comic tastes.  My favorites tend to be from the ""How To"" series and the sports shorts and include ""The Art of Skiing,"" ""How to Swim,"" ""How to be a Sailor,"" ""How to Play Golf"" (""Contrary to popular opinion, golf is not a waste of time.""), ""The Olympic Champ,"" ""How to Be a Detective,"" and ""How to Sleep.""  There are some others I liked that fall outside these boundaries and include ""Victory Vehicles"" (talk about creative), ""African Diary,"" ""Californy'er Bust"" (always in the mood for a good pun), and ""Father's Lion.""  These, of course, are just some of the highlights.
Goofy works best when he's trying something easy and failing in imaginative ways.  Some of the cartoons near the beginning of the second disc feature him in more ordinary situations, and I didn't find them nearly as fun.  But these are few, and the rest make up for them.
As is the case with the other sets in the series, Leonard Maltin has my dream job of playing host.  He provides some interesting introduction to the character and times that produced short cartoons.  I'll agree that his introduction on potentially controversial cartoons don't add much, but if that's the price we have to pay to get to see them, I don't really care.  Both discs have background material that any Disney or animation fan will love.
As other's have noted, this set is missing a couple shorts.  Why remains a mystery, although those missing ""How to Ride a Horse"" can find it on the ""Behind the Scenes at the Walt Disney Studio"" set also released in 2002.  A ""play all"" feature would have been nice, but I found I enjoyed the shorts in small doses, so it really made no difference to me.
Goofy is one of the Disney Studio's signature characters, and it's nice to see them treating him and their history with respect.  While it could have been better, it's certainly enjoyable the way it is.  I will enjoy laughing with this set for years to come.",1046736000,3,2157,4.566233766233767
1776614,5,B00006II6N,"You can't go wrong with a set like this. Except for the fact that you can't play the whole collection all the way through, it's beautifully-reproduced.
These are all cartoons that I got to watch again and again on The (still new) Disney Channel way back in 1984-86, and man, did I ever take them for granted after a while. After buying this, I took a touching trip down memory lane as I watched these cartoons for the first time in nearly two decades.
One of the things I'm grateful for is that I can jump to the shorts I like and ignore others without wearing out the recording or quality since this is a DVD. In my case, that's a good thing because I don't like all of them for reasons I'll mention while describing the set in the following paragraph.
For those of you who have never experienced the entire original catalogue of Goofy cartoons: if you think today's celebrities go entirely too crazy getting their bodies redone, wait until you discover what the animators did to poor Goofy's design, especially during the '50s! It's a bizarre peculiarity, one that I've found fascinates some and irritates others, and you'll get to witness it here... the Disney staff went overly crazy experimenting with Goofy's design to the point where he sometimes wasn't even consistently logical within the same short! Sometimes they gave him bare skin instead of fur complete with human feet with toenails (UGH!!!), sometimes they removed his ears, at one point they moved his now-signature teeth together into beaver buck teeth, and even got to the point where they were changing around his personality and even robbed him of his unique voice! Whether or not you find this irritating or fascinating while watching all this depends on your personal likes and dislikes. For me, it has always been the former to this day. Even when keeping his design consistent with black feet, they have insisted on giving him human toes instead of doggish ones (and to be fair, I don't like the fact that Mickey and Minnie, not to mention various Tex Avery cartoons, are also this way and I personally think it looks ugly), something which drives me crazy to no end and has long kept me from completely falling in love with Goofy as a splendid cartoon character (I adore animals and like such basic details to look like animals when having them on their ""hind legs"". I mean, seriously, I love experimenting with character design as much as anyone else, but the liberties they took with THIS character are ridiculous, especially since they all failed and Goofy has now been brought back to his original look on ""House of Mouse"" after all of that). It made me want to grab a pencil and fix the poor thing all the time, especially his feet. ;)
That's a shame too, because I love Goofy and his personality so much... but some of the cartoons keep him consistent to my personal liking and, even with black feet with human toes, at least the design works well enough in those shorts that it doesn't distract me as badly as all the other detail changes do. So I find myself playing the cartoons I enjoy and ignoring the other ones.
But as I say, that's one of the cool things about a DVD: you can just jump around at will and play whatever you like the most to death, and that's precisely what I've been doing. I still love ""Aquamania"", which was done with the then-new Xerox camera, which remains one of the most beautifully-drawn Goofy cartoons ever. The early ones are easily my biggest favourites, but there's one particular here which I've forgotten all about until now and I've been playing it nonstop: ""The Big Wash"". This one is, in my opinion, the definitive Goofy cartoon: even with the weird foot design, he is animated wonderfully with lots of sharp expression without a single misstep or weird design experiment to get in the way, and his voice here--if possible--sounds even cuter than in the other ones (I love how he sounds when he gets tickled here!). And, of course, the story for it is both funny and cute at the same time. This is the Goofy I loved as a child, not to mention the one that everyone expects to see at Disneyland, in what I call the ""top-notch gloss look"" Disney perfected in their animation in the mid-to-late 40s that graced such later films as ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Peter Pan"".
This set is the first time to my knowledge that Disney has ever bothered to release the *full* collection of Goofy cartoons, and I mention all of the above to assure others that it's worth having for the price even if you don't enjoy every short because you'll be guaranteed to get that ""special one"" you've been hoping to own for ages (provided it's a theatrically-released Goofy solo vehicle). So it's worth buying just for that opportunity alone.
And besides all that technical stuff, it's of course worth having just to enjoy. As a grown-up cartoonist rewatching them all and even ""rediscovering"" them, I realized that I was watching a part of my own artistic roots. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
Except for his poor feet, of course. ;)",1046563200,2,5037,4.622767857142857

This set that spans Goofy's entire solo film career from 1939's Goofy and Wilber to 1961's Aquamania. The set also explores Goofy's evolution from simpleton to sports expert to 1950s everyman. My favorite shorts in the series are those featuring Goofy in his everyman roles: family man, husband, father, and employee. Much of the cleaver domestic comedy is wonderful, particularly ""Father's Day Off"". This short features Goofy as a father trying to take care of the house for a day while his wife is out shopping. Goofy's attempts to keep everything running smoothly from dealing with his son to getting all the household chores done has hillarious results. The set also includes lesser seen and often censored shorts including ""Californy or Bust"", a western film parody complete with Indian attacks, and ""Victory Vehicles"", which focuses on the transportation problems due to shortages and rationing in World War II.

From 1939-1961, Goofy's complete collection chronicles Goofys rise from Dippy Dawg to the everyman he is.  Leonard Maltin chose all of the cartoons because it is impossible to choose a few, so here is a review tot ell each one.  Leonard Maltin opens the DVD with an introduction about Goofy history.  When you get to the menu, the only problem is no play all.  You could either go to Chronoligical order or Alphabetical.  I'll go with Chronoligical.

Those are the main parts of the show.  But there is more.  On disc one, there are two featurettes.  One is mainly about the history of Goofy.  Leonard Maltin talks about  Goofy's past and cartoons he really likes.  He talks about Goofy's early days as well.  There is also a featurette about Pinto Colvig, the original voice of the goof.  He talks about how Pinto left and went to the circus and came back and did Goofy's voice until he died.  Pinto was a circus clown before being hired by Disney as well.  On disc 2, The featurette is a ""Conversation with Bill Farmer.""  Leonard has a conversation with today's voice of Goofy.  He talks about his original job and how he got interested in being goofy.  So he tells his story and demonstrates some of his voices.  There are also two galleries with Audio attachments.  When going through the Gallery, Goofy's voice will say something like,""Gawrsh,"" or ""Hey! That looks like me!""  These galleries are ""Goofy Through the Years"" and ""Publicity and Memorabilia Gallery.""  Some audio attachments are by Leonard Maltin as well.  There are introductions on both discs and intros for a few important goof shorts.  Some shows aren't featured on this set like, ""Gaucho Goofy,""""How to Ride a Horse,"" and ""Freewayphobia 1&2"" because they are either in movies or they are educational films prepared in the studio.  So this disc is just an individual release collection starring Goofy.  This disc is truely the best Goofy collection ever created.  There are only 125,000, so get your copy quick.

I wanted my kids to see them.  BUT, I didn't want to pull one like my Grandfather-in-law did and make my kids watch strange black-and-white cartoons that really weren't funny, had an annoying style of animation, and didn't make any sense.
The BIG question:  Do all the classic Goofy shorts stand the test of time?
Well, my 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son think they're hilarious (assuming I can judge my their laughter) and I laughed myself silly until I cried last night watching ""Hockey Homicide"". Buy this 2-disc set - IF you can still can!  This is just chock full of pure Disney genius.  You won't regret it.  Hours of classic ROTFL (rolling-on-the-floor-laughing) Goofy.

1776618,4,B00006II6N,"Finally the classic Goofy cartoons are on DVD.  These are some of the funniest Disney has made, and they're presented wonderfully.  Last year we bought the Mickey Mouse: In Living Color DVD and it was one of the best purchases we made.  So, this was a natural follow up.  The menus are great and can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically.  The video also looks clean and beautiful.
The only drawback to this particular set is that you can't set it on ""PLAY ALL"" and just let the shorts play one after the other (as you could on the Mickey Mouse collection).  For us, this meant we had to let our 4 year old be able to select which title to play.
Also, as a note to parents, Disney has left the cartoons just like they were before, even if it included material that may not be politically correct by today's standards.  For historical preservation purposes, I applaud Disney for leaving them untouched and would have been bothered any other way.  However, as a parent, I did want to watch these first with my kids so that I could clear up things I felt needed discussing.  For example, one short about dieting goes a little overboard in the jokes on overweight people, and may rub off on kids in an undesirable way.  There isn't much of this for sure, just a few things here and there.
I feel those are small qualms though, and, those aside, I highly recommend this DVD set.  It is a great collectors item and highly entertaining animation for both old and young.  A great purchase.",1043712000,7,1487,4.4869888475836435
1776619,5,B00006II6N,"Everybody knows who Goofy is, but which Goofy?
The best thing about this entry in the outstanding Walt Disney Treasures collection is tracing the evolution of the character from a naive country bumpkin to a harried suburban ... well, bumpkin. While Mickey Mouse remained essentially a static, one-note character throughout his cinematic career, Goofy demonstrated an expanding range of characterizations unmatched in motion picture history until Tom Hanks went from ""Bosom Buddies"" to ""Philadelphia.""
OK, maybe that's overstating things a bit, but it is fun watching the various periods of the character, my favorite being the 1940's ""How To ..."" series (the scene in ""The Olympic Champ"" when the narrator breaks into poetry while poor pole-vaulting Goofy tries to keep his balance is classic).
And it's good to see a cartoon like ""No Smoking,"" with Goofy portrayed as a hopeless nicotine addict, escape from the Disney conglomerate unedited.
Yes, I regret the decision not to include a Play All feature, and I'd rather have the feature about Pinto Colvig be twice as long as it is, and the one about Bill Farmer be half as long as it is. But when you've got an embarrassment of riches like this, I can't quibble.
So, Mr. Maltin, when can we expect ""The Complete Donald Duck""?",1043625600,3,1276,4.995305164319249
1776620,5,B00006II6N,"Sure there are 2 or 3 omissions from this ""Complete"" collection, but this is, otherwise, a perfect assembly of classic theatrical animated shorts. Titles like ""Californy or Bust"" and ""Victory Vehicles"" are presented in their entirety, not cut for modern politically correct sensibilities. (Some of this material has been absent from The Disney Channel for years.) Now if only Disney will include ""Der Fuhrer's Face"" when it comes time to release a similar Donald Duck collection.
Fret not for ""How to Ride a Horse"". That short was originally presented in THE RELUCTANT DRAGON feature which is included on ""Walt Disney Treasures - Behind the Scenes at the Walt Disney Studio"". As for the absence of the ""Freewayphobia"" cartoons, I suggest that Disney consider an educational collection in the future that can include the Freewayphobia(s), the Jiminy Cricket shorts, ""Donald in Mathmagic Land"", and Ward Kimball's music series among others.
A note to the owners of Warner Bros. and MGM titles. ""The Complete Goofy"" is just the sort of thing we animation lovers are looking for in a collection. Please keep this in mind whenever you get around (please) to releasing DVDs of Bugs Bunny, the Roadrunner, Daffy Duck and a decent Tom & Jerry collection.
One more added note:  I've noticed that many of the other reviews of this title have complained about the lack of a ""play all"" feature.  I have found that if I use my DVD player's ""shuffle"" ability I can watch all of the cartoons on a disc without repeatedly pressing buttons.

Goofy was a better co-star than star, and you get more pleasure from his turns in classic Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons than from those in which he starred on his own, the only ones collected here.  Also, it is utterly infuriating that this DVD does not let you ""play all"" the cartoons with a single click.  Each successive cartoon you watch must be separately selected and clicked on one of two menus (alphabetical or chronological).  That's OK if you're only watching one or two cartoons, but is most annoying when you would like to simply kick back and watch the disk.

Why does the collection need to end in 1961, why not 1965 with  Freewayphobia No. 1 and Goofy's Freeway Trouble? According to one site, these were the last two Goofy shorts until 1983, and the ONLY ones not included on the collection.

Geef"" era -- they're all here. Some are better than others, of course. The earlier ""Geef"" cartoons, before Pinto Clovig returned as Goofy's voice, don't feel like the character at all.
There are also three great featurettes on this set, one about Clovig himself, one about the evolution of Goofy and an interview with Bill Farmer, the current voice of the Goof. Hearing Goofy's voice coming out of this jolly, rust-haired man is jarring and wonderful at the same time.
One complaint -- boy, has Disney gotten PC. On four of these cartoons, they found it necessary to do a disclaimer by Leonard Maltin because the cartoons contain some potentially ""sensitive"" material -- a World War II era cartoon has the audacity to use the term ""Jap,"" a western send-up has stereotypical ""injuns,"" a short about a teacher sparks fears of school violence and a bullfighting classic portrays Mexicans in an ""unflattering light."" All four disclaimers have essentially the same message -- ""People weren't as smart then as they are now! Please don't hate us.""
Please.
I'm all in favor of intros, putting cartoons in context, historical data, etc., but the way these four cartoons were singled out really insulted my intelligence. It's GOOFY, for Heaven's sake, was anybody planning to take the cartoons seriously? In my review of a previous ""Treasures"" DVD, ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color,"" I said that Warner Bros should use these discs as a model for how to do Looney Tunes DVDs. If they followed the model of ""The Complete Goofy,"" we'd have a disclaimer in front of every Speedy Gonzales short.
It's still a really good collection, but for maximum enjoyment, when you see Leonard Maltin's face pop up before these four shorts, hit the ""next"" button on your remote.",1041206400,30,1992,4.913946587537092

After each short the DVD goes back to the alphabetical or chronilogical menu (depending on where you started). While this is fine if you wish to view a particular short it is really irritating if you ( and your 3 year old) want to sit down and enjoy a series shorts.
Conclusion: If you are a Goofy buff and want the complete goofy to study and review...this is a great collection. However, if you are a parent and your child wants to watch goofy cartoons this is a pain .... You will need to sit with the child and select every cartoon individually.

There's also a little retrospective of the voice of Goofy, Pinto Colvig, who was the first Bozo The Clown as well and great behind-the scenes documentaries show the birth and evolution of Goofy. If you wanna see the titles, read Amazon.com's description...I'm here as a consumer to tell you that you WILL LAUGH OUT LOUD AS YOU VIEW THIS COLLECTION. Even though they're older cartoons, even the most ""politically correct"" people shouldn't have any trouble with these for the kids. This is funny stuff from a funny character by a great man.",1039651200,4,949,4.9375

Containing almost twice as many cartoons as the Mickey Mouse in Living color disc, this DVD offers up one of the most hilarious and high quality cartoon collections on the market. I had literally forgotten some of these cartoons after they disappeared from the current pc market. For the more sensitive cartoons that Disney fears will be offensive, Leonard Maltin makes a brief introduction that serves not only to put sensitivities at ease, but improve our appreciation for the humor by placing it in historical context. This feature gives collectors hope that the delayed ""Disney Goes to War"" DVD will be released without unnecessary editing.
Additionally, two options are available this time that weren't previously on previous ""Treasures"" releases. We are allowed to choose between chronological and alphabetical lists of the cartoons. This gives the viewer the ability to find specific cartoons with ease and also to view the evolution of Goofy's endearing character. The only drawback, as another reviewer mentioned, is that one cannot choose a ""play all"" feature that was available on previous titles.
The picture quality on this DVD is astounding and each cartoon looks better than I have ever seen before. The sound quality is decent and has not been restored to a higher quality than the age of the cartoon demands. Some marvelous features are included, such as a lengthy discussion with Bill Farmer, the current voice of Goofy, who offers us several samples of his famous voice and even what I call the ""Goofy fall"" scream. A biography on Pinto Colvig, the original voice of Goofy, is also very informative. It explains that the birth of the ""how to"" cartoons came from Colvig's temporary departure from Disney which left Goofy without a voice. An interesting tidbit for Disney fans is that Colvig also provided the voice of Grumpy and Sleepy in the Disney classic, Snow White. These and many other extras round out the collectors ""Complete Goofy"" experience.
Although this collection would be loved by children of all ages, these Goofy cartoons may be best appreciated by adults who understand his struggles as an ""everyman"". I can speak for myself when I say that these cartoons are funnier now more than ever as I can relate with Goofy as a parent, a hard worker who can't seem to relax on vacation, or sleep through the night. With only 125,000 copies being printed, this DVD which is bound to be far more popular than previous ""Treasures"" is sure to go fast. It is a purchase one won't regret.",1039478400,14,2697,4.890829694323144

Rentals from college libraries has been my only chance to enjoy the brilliant comedy and evolution of this classic cartoon character. I hope Disney regain its senses and advertise a reprinting of many of these Treasures collects. Spending $100+ on a complete Mickey, Goofy, and Donald set would make more sense than $170 for just this set or having to buy a DvD player that plays UK DvDs.",1484697600,,471,4.686746987951807
