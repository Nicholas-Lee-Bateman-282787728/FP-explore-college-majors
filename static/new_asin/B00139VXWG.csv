8249520,4,B00139VXWG,"OK typical Spanish-language, Mexican-made (no-subtitles) Blue Demon action/sci-fi flick.  This time he's fighting against a bunch of baddies and their scientists who have created brains independent of bodies who have bad attitudes of their own.  Blue Demon teams up with police and agents to stop the evil organization.  Has the usual amount of wrestling bouts.  I ordered the Media Trading Network, Inc. DVD release and the quality is very good.  Recommended for Blue Demon fans.",1420675200,,480,5.346666666666667
