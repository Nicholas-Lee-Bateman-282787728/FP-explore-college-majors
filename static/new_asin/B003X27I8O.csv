4214635,5,B003X27I8O,"This was great and at an awesome price.  At Best Buy these seasons go for around $30 to $35 a piece, so to get seasons 1-5 and the Christmas special at the Amazon price was a steal.  The one thing I wondered was if these came as one big box with the different discs.  To my relief they come in their individual cases for each season like if you bought them separately.  Would buy again!",1290297600,77,386,4.1066666666666665

4214639,5,B003X27I8O,"This is great for those who want to get the whole series (that's on DVD) in one shot.  The packaging is simply cardboard with pictures of cans.  So those who think this might be a special pack, it's not.  Inside are all the seasons of Sunny.  In my opinion, the best show on TV.",1284940800,36,278,4.092592592592593
4214640,4,B003X27I8O,"its typical for people to find something amusing but not express this emotion unless someone is around. if you are one of those people you won't be for long. i had seen snippets of this series before and purchased it because i had watched all of my arrested development dvds over and over. it seemed to toe the line so i grabbed it. not disappointed at all. its a slightly more colorful humor(read crass) than ad but im sitting on the deck producing lulz not for the mere expression of amusement to others, but because its that funny. don't read the review incorrecty: its not a full 27 mins of laughs each time but you will catch yourself making snorts 3 or 4 times throughout each episode. for those who are on the fence when considering springing for the entire dvd series my suggestion is to grab the first and second seasons. you won't be disappointed.

oh, the packaging for 1-5/christmas resembles a six pack case. what a bunch of clowns.",1284595200,3,945,4.526315789473684

If you hate it you shouldn't be reading this anyway.",1408492800,,305,4.016393442622951

I'm gonna keep it anyway because I don't want to send it all the way back over the Atlantic and wait another 4 weeks for the new DVDs (odered from Germany). Anyhow, since the DVD box was sold as new I feel a little pranked, therefore only 3 stars. The show itself would of course get 5.",1407715200,,414,4.1875

4214665,5,B003X27I8O,"This is a review of the show itself, not the DVD set. Do people really have issues with DVD sets these days??

I love the oddball comedy and dark humor of this show. It is so well-written and the characters are the most awful human beings on the planet (except for Charlie). This show is addictive like crack, and you will find yourself rewatching it over and over again, even if it's just in the background while you play a game of CharDee MacDennis or apply your Kitten Mittens to that rampaging junkyard cat trapped in your wall.

It's not for everyone, and the first season is definitely kind of weak, but from the second season on (Frank Reynolds makes this show) it is superb!",1397088000,,682,4.448

The Show iMHO:
In Family Guy, Peter Griffin usually has a thing or fad he plays with throughout an episode. Its mostly used for the cheap laugh or sight gag until it serves its pont. This show does the same thing; only it eat its up, evacuates it, pees on it and then consumes it again and again until episode ends with some tongue in cheek commentary or satire point of view which is then hamfisted into the viewers face. Enjoy!",1355702400,,625,4.2521008403361344

4214710,4,B003X27I8O,"Regarding: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Seasons 1-5 + Christmas Special

The description states that the format of these DVDs is widescreen, however when reviewing the bottom of the box set upon arrival, it states that only season 5 and the Christmas Special are formatted as widescreen. Seasons 1-4 are fullscreen. This was very upsetting (for me at least). I contacted customer service via email and they were...less than helpful. I don't even think they read my email, except for 5 words. I then had customer service call me and I spoke with a Lori (Laurie?...it may have been Lauren). She was a pleasure to speak with and extremely helpful. She offered me two different options to satisfy me and I accepted the the one that suited my situation.

Just an FYI to everyone--evidently seasons 1-4 have not even been RELEASED in widescreen...at least not anywhere on amazon. I wanted to send back seasons 1-4 from the box set and receive the widescreen versions, but was informed that there is no such thing available on amazon's site. This could be true in general--I don't know and haven't done the research. So, BE WARNED, the whole box set is NOT WIDESCREEN!

With that aside, this show is awesome. You really should still buy it. It makes a great Christmas present to yourself or others. The product would get 5 stars if it was widescreen.",1354665600,3,1349,4.781115879828326

You get all the funny extras as with the regular dvd's, you get season 1-5 + x-mas special, that's like the value of 11 wonderful dvd's for the very low price of 50 bucks, you have to be real stupid not to take advantage of this deal, and if you are  you should have your own show.",1352764800,,337,4.029850746268656

Everything is perfect but my package had at least 3 dvds that DID NOT WORK by any dvd player computer or ps3.
I did not report this i have learned that was the down side..
So my only advice would be check everything as soon as you get it if not file for return or exchange..

The box art is great, it's a six pack of beer, on the top, you can see the beer spouts and some lipstick marks, very cool indeed.

If you like dry, twisted humor and are not easily offended, then this is the show for you. What I like about this show is how they have what some would call ""stupid"" situations, but in a way, they seem very real, and thanks to the cast doing an outstanding job at portraying life as a twisted chain of events. They never win and always come short, but in each episode, they manage to simply continue with their lives as if nothing happened. I really suck at reviewing TV show, movies, etc, so I'll stop here and just say this is a very unique show with utterly F*&$ up humor that anybody with an open mind will enjoy.",1346803200,5,924,4.28

Even though I am an old geezer I still have a sense of humor and this is the funniest thing to come along in my memory. The only thing worse than being an old geezer is being an old geezer on a fixed retirement income. That is where the value of buying this as a bundled set of seasons comes in.

You can't beat the price (compare to the cost of purchasing the individual seasons), and you can't beat the twenty-some hours of laughs these discs contain. That is something that you cannot put a price tag on.",1337212800,,1068,5.132183908045977
4214728,5,B003X27I8O,"One of the few tv shows that is so good, it should be required viewing for any fan of tv sitcoms...except those who are easily offended. This is an ensemble show, with 5 main characters. All 5 are incredibly talented. It's not like other ensemble shows like Taxi, which was a great show...but had a few weak characters. Any of the characters on Sunny could be the funniest one on just about any other sitcom. They work together like clockwork. The dialogue is snappy and brilliant.

Unklike most shows, all the characters are fairly similar. There isn't a smart character, an evil character, a nerd, a dumb character...they're all a little on the dumb side, and they're all evil. If you watched Taxi, it's like every character is Louie DiPalma, but worse. They have no regard for anyone outside their circle, and not that much regard for one another. Turns out you don't have to have wildly different characters to make great comedy.

Just to give you an example of how crude this show can be...in one episode Frank (Danny Devito) shows up at the funeral of the husband of his sister-in-law..so he can bang her, to get back at his wife, who also has recently died. The sister-in-law turns Frank down, so he starts messing around with her daughter, which would technically be his niece. Some of the characters sniff glue. Dennis (Glenn Howerton) anonymously calls women he's dating, disguising his voice, threatening them with physical violence...so he can later swoop in as their protector of his made-up stalker. It's not all this bad, but they do come close to crossing the line now and then.",1336176000,3,1594,4.750902527075812

Price:
I think this would be a great gift idea - it's a steal at the $55.49 price... TONS of episodes for this price, it will give most people hours and hours of laughs.

Type of show:
-For those not familiar with the series this is not something you'd want to purchase for anyone who can't handle foul language and crude jokes.
-Great kind of show to just have on in the background while friends are over - it's not something you have to pay attention to from beginning of an episode to end to understand - there is constant entertainment; also, while there are story lines for the show and even throughout the series, you don't have to have seen the first 2 seasons for example to understand or enjoy later episodes in series.

4214739,4,B003X27I8O,"This is a very demented yet hilariously funny show.  If you havent' seen it before you need to watch a few episodes on FX before you buy it to be sure it doesn't offend you. It is also on other channels but is edited.  Somehow FX doesn't have to edit out the profanity/slight nudity (usually some dudes butt). This is definately not a show for people under 18, although their packaging rating says 14.
Now regarding the multi-pack purchased, it comes in a simulated ""6 pack"". Some people have commented that it is a cheap cardboard box, but that is kind of misleading. Yes the box is a waxed cardboard with pics of a 6 pack, but it is of good quality (it's not fall apart cheap). There is also extra room in the box where I have put my season 6 DVD and there is still room for season 7 when it becomes available, allowing me to save shelf space.  The dvd's are all FULL SCREEN except for season 5 and the Christmas special, which are widescreen. Amazon incorrectly advertises that the whole set is widescreen. The full screen picture takes up my entire 50"" screen though, without the black sidebars around the pic.  It is evident in season 1 that it was a new show, as the picture quality is ever so slightly bad.  That is it is not as clear and bright as what season two and later seasons are, hence my 4 star rating, otherwise it would have been 5 star. If you are using an upconverting blue ray player you probably won't notice that. I still have a pre-blue ray, pre-HD, DVD player/recorder, with an HD plasma t.v. . If you appreciate demented humor and aren't offended by profanity, sexual commentary/situations, racial observations, stereotyping, some gore (fake blood, spit, puke, etc..)by all means you need to become a ""Sunny"" fan and buy this set!",1325376000,2,1756,4.492163009404389

All but season four has commentary on select episodes. As a fan I like to watch the commentary for any extra insight they may have to dish out, but there isn't much. Aside from season five episodes with dr. Drew commenting on the interesting psychological aspects of their characters with them, the commentary consists of them just watching and laughing at themselves with you and them making fun of you for sitting around watching the commentary.

I may be missing something in the description but I assumed they would all be in widescreen.  Season 3,5, and the christmas special were widescreen while the 1+2 and 4 were fullscreen and is printed so on the DVD jewel case.

That being said I may have missed something in the product description, don't know if it is normal just letting people know what I recieved.

But if you are thinking about getting into the show, do it you won't regret it.  Regardless of format this show is hilarious.",1294876800,4,713,4.488372093023256

It's Always Sunny takes these ""bad"" characteristics and exploits them for some seriously funny TV and I absolutely approve (hey, it makes me feel like I'm a really sweet and polite person).
