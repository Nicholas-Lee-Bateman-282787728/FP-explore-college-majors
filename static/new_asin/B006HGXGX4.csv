8498387,4,B006HGXGX4,"This is a very appealing concept: Dinosaur Jr. performing Bug in its entirety at DCs 9:30 Club (one of the best places to see a show on the East Coast) filmed by six mega-fans. The first thing youll notice is how tight the band sounds and how perfectly the DVD captures that sound. Seriously, forget about live showsmost bands would kill to get a sound this crisp in the studio! J Mascis, Lou Barlow and Murph may look a lot older since Bug came out in 1988 (J Mascis in particular is starting to look like Gandalfs beer-drinking younger brother) but theyve retained every ounce of their youthful energy and love of high-volume dynamics. Everyone in the band does their part to make the songs sound great: Murph is a strong drummer, and Barlow plays the affable indie-punk on bass, but for me the biggest treat is watching Mascis solos which are fluid and full of technique, despite their thank god for earplugs volume. Having never had the opportunity to see Dinosaur Jr. live for myself, I can only imagine the kind of air-moving effect the band must have had in a club like the 9:30.

You might remember that Bug was only thirty-two minutes long in its original form, which would be pretty skimpy for a concert, and a bad value for a DVD purchase. Well, for starters theres an encore of two songs not on Bug (Sludgefeast and Raisans), and another two songs from the same show included as bonus features. Theres also a twenty-minute interview with Mascis, Murph and Barlow talking to Henry Rollins, which is kind of interesting as an experiment (Rollins interviewed them prior to each nights show on the East Coast leg of the Bug tour) but also kind of awkward since Mascis, by all accounts Dinosaur Jrs leader, doesnt say much. Rollins shouldnt take it personally though: he doesnt talk much during the concert either, preferring to follow the teachings of Aerosmith and let the music do the talking. Theres also a backstage interview with the six fans who shot the concert, a clip of Henry Rollins giving a history of The 9:30 Club, and an interview with J (who, yet again, barely says anything) and director Dave Markey, who shares some interesting stories from the bands past. Well done.",1461801600,2,2193,4.666666666666667

8498389,5,B006HGXGX4,"What can you say. David Markey is the best filmmaker when it comes  to live music around. Amazing quality and camera angles. Better  than  being at the show, besides feeling the physical assault their noise sends out.
Wonderful stuff, obviously a great album, and even a couple of extra encore songs.
Must have for any Dinasour Jr fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Or even a good introduction to them. If anyone likes noise, great guitar playing, brutal rhythms,underrated songwriting, and has never heard Dinasour Jr, do yourself a favor buy this and enjoy their catalog from there.
It's so good i'm giving it 5 stars, even with Henry Rollins involved with the interview. When did he become the American aficionado on music? You're not John Peel man.  Dude we know you were in black flag cause u kissed greg's ass, your tattoos are so cool, especially w/ biker shorts, you grew up near Ian, and you're a hit songwriter............are you still a liar henry?
