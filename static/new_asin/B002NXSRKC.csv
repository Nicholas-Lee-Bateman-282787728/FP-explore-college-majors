But as I watched I found myself annoyed at the theological language and posturing that was happening.  I continually felt like a good point was coming, only to watch as they steered clear of open and honest answers to stay safely in the zone of human wisdom.

What I wanted was real dialogue between three people in hopes to spur along the conversation in my own life.

What I found was another example of impressive resumes winning out over personal content.

I recommend the Nooma series instead.",1267056000,4,626,4.603603603603603
8375578,5,B002NXSRKC,"I've been attempting to host a small group for some church guys over the last year. We've had varying success with other resources that are out there, but nothing has really seemed to 'stick' until I discovered Convergence. Most everyone in my group is averse to much of Christian literature and resources. But everyone had either read Donald Miller's Blue Like Jazz or seen him speak... so they were willing to give this a try. The dialogue is engaging and has been the catalyst for some of the deepest conversations we've ever had. It's amazing how a tool like this has brought out so much in guys that typically don't like to share much (other than sports and favorite beers). My wife is now using Convergence with some women that are part of a group she's involved in... similar results - although much different conversations. Anyway, I'd highly recommend this product if you are looking for a resource to fit unique group (even non 'small group' small groups) experiences. As soon as we finish the Frustration and False Gods DVD we are moving on to the other products in the series.",1266364800,3,1088,4.701570680628272
