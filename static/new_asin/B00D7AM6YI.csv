8590358,5,B00D7AM6YI,"I had never heard of this series before so I was intrigued to see what it was all about. First off I will say that I enjoyed the artwork in the series. The cartoonists did a great job and captured great action and characterization through the episodes. Second, the plot of the episodes was engaging and action packed. My favorite episode personally was The Taken, but you get five in this DVD which include:

Shaw K'Naw
The Taken
Duel Hard
Heart of Darkness
Darkness of Heart

On top of the two items mentioned above, I also thought that they did a great job at creating Choten, the nemesis in this series. Talk about scary looking - I know I would not want to run into him anytime soon!

All-in-all this was a great series and I will be looking for further episodes to watch in the future!
