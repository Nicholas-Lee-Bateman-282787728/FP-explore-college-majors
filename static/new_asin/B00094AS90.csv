2265494,3,B00094AS90,"Since I have not read the novel, I can judge this piece merely as a film. And this is one of the most boring ones I've seen, although I adore costume drama. (Well, the three stars go to Mr. Sewell only.)",1187481600,4,203,3.975609756097561
2265495,4,B00094AS90,"Hopeless romantic that I am, I do like a happier ending than the one in this movie, but I still liked it. Good acting all around and the movie isn't very predictable, which is always a treat. I enjoy not knowing what's going to happen.",1180656000,,235,4.2444444444444445

2265497,3,B00094AS90,"I wasn't very familiar with this story and purchased based on reviews.  It's well done, but I didn't really get why the Rufus Sewel character was so enamored with the Emily Woof character (at least initally).  If you are looking for an easy period romance this wouldn't be the story for you.  Those familiar with the story may find it more appealing.",1168300800,3,350,4.612903225806452
2265498,3,B00094AS90,"I just finished watching The Woodlanders and was really disappointed. Not because the acting or movie quality were bad but because it has been edited terribly. Other reviewers commented on this also-unfortunately I haven't had a chance to see the original version of this film, but I can still tell the extent of important scenes that were cut out. Everything moves along too quickly and there are many plot holes and short sequences which seem pasted together without much ""flow"" to them. What a sad injustice the editor has done to this movie. I did enjoy what there was to be had but it could have been so much better. I just don't understand what they were thinking. It's not as if the movie is overly long. Another half hour or so would have made a world of difference and improved the film greatly. I'd like to recommend this movie based on the excellent performances, music, and scenery, but unfortunately even they couldn't save the botched up editing in my opinion. Guess I will see if I can get hold of an original copy of Woodlanders as I'd really like to watch the complete film as it should have been.",1149120000,15,1114,4.575
2265499,3,B00094AS90,"Previous reviews go a long way toward explaining what's wrong with this movie -- it's been injudiciously and unwisely cut! As it stands, it's not a bad use of an hour and a half -- compared to what's probably showing on network TV at the time. But it could have been great had the US distributor left it alone as it was shown in Britain.

I agree with previous reviewers who mention that the story seems rushed and the characterizations somewhat superficial. What a lost opportunity.",1144627200,25,483,4.616279069767442
2265500,4,B00094AS90,"A shorter version of a longer 1997 film of one of Thomas Hardy's lesser-known novels has been released in America on this bare-bones DVD. It will please viewers unfamiliar with the entire film as much as displease those who have seen the original or read the novel, the author's favorite of all his works. Characters, backstories and nuances that are Hardy trademarks are given short shrift in both versions. Not to worry, however. Newcomers to ""The Woodlanders"" will like this re-edited film, reduced and refocused as it is, because it is so well cast, acted, directed and photographed in beautiful locations. The film confirms that Hardy is as superb a storyteller as he is a social commentator.

A timber merchant sends his daughter (Emily Woof) off to school but welcomes home less a country lass than an educated woman who is now ill at ease among her kith and kin, including the young woodcutter (Rufus Sewell) she promised to marry. Instead, she marries a class-conscious doctor (Cal Macaninch) on the insistence of her father, who seeks to improve her station. Everyone is at cross-purposes in Hardy stories (he rarely writes villains) and they always come to grief. This one is no exception, except that it is exceptionally well-told, even in this shortened version. ""The Woodlanders"" received a handful of awards in England and deserved every one of them.",1128124800,63,1365,4.9868421052631575
2265501,3,B00094AS90,"This is a good film but I have seen the original version (region 2) and sadly this region 1 DVD is missing crucial scenes, leaving some glaring holes in the story, particularly concerning the excellent Polly Walker's character, Mrs. Charmond.  Had I not read the novel and seen the original film, I would have missed some important elements.

The cast is top rate, particularly Rufus Sewell and Emily Woof, in her first starring role.",1123200000,41,434,4.851351351351352
2265502,5,B00094AS90,"I am so excited that this is finally coming out on DVD.  This was shown in England, and is a wonderful rendition of Thomas Hardy's novel The Woodlanders, and perfectly cast.  It is great to see some of his less popular, but excellent, novels being recognized and brought to the screen.  Perfect for any fan of Hardy, 19th Century novels or anything about rural England.",1117584000,12,369,4.6461538461538465

2265578,2,B00094AS90,"Horrible ending! If you want to enjoy a love story, this is not for you. It is set up to where it could be so cute, but it is one of those movies that is more like real life and not a happily ever after.",1482278400,,203,3.533333333333333

I get suckered into renting them because the description sounds like something I'd like and the costuming  looks fabulous! They aren't horrible films, but they're always sad! I'm more of a Jane Austen fan and I like happy endings. The only Hardy novel I was familiar with was Tess and this one wasn't as depressing as that. The production was well done, it's just not something I'd want to watch again anytime soon.",1449878400,3,484,4.761904761904762

2265607,4,B00094AS90,"This movie is based on the book by Thomas Hardy. If you are familiar with his work, you know going in that it's going to show the sadder, shadowy side of life. This is no exception. The story is actually quite simple. An ignorant, but successful man wants his daughter to have the education he didn't get so he sends her off for schooling. When she gets back, she no longer really fits in. The man she was informally engaged too all those years ago is now beneath her so when the fancy, new doctor pays her some attention, her father encourages her to drop the old beau and settle on the new. Nothing really goes right after that.

It's not a happy tale. It's an honest and emotional one though. You may not like the way it ends, but if you can see yourself in one of the characters, it may make you think about life a bit. It's not a fabulous movie, but it's good.",1424476800,5,865,4.179640718562874

2265609,2,B00094AS90,"In this film, the drama is inflated to swollen proportions, then turned loose to flap squeal it's way to flaccid collapse.  I found no sympathetic characters and the situations seemed contrived only by the characters' own determination to make bad situations worse.  According to other reviewers, this film has been badly edited from it's original version aired in Britain.  That would explain the ridiculous plot holes and pacing.  It doesn't explain Rufus Sewell's character.  He's just really irritatingly brooding and does little to persuade either sympathy or understanding.  I have to admit, I find Sewell kind of creepy anyway, but I can get past that when he's doing a great job with a good role.

My college-aged daughter turned this on, and when I heard her laughing, I sat to see what was so funny.  We ended up laughing and supplying our own lines the rest of the way through the film.  It was that silly.",1417219200,3,917,4.826923076923077

2265612,1,B00094AS90,"Rufus Sewell has been excellent in other films, but his heart was not in this one - I'm sure Emily Woolf is a great young actress, but this film gave her little to work with - low-budget, and long moments of nothing happening?",1403395200,,226,4.27906976744186

Was nice to see the girl finally get some backbone, but only after her life took a turn for the worse. The movie was OK and took no real concentration to figure things out.

2265640,3,B00094AS90,I like Thomas Hardy as a writer and am glad that this book was turned into a movie. I found it very dark (on the screen)though and do realise that the movie was filmed in places when they didn't have electricity but it was difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Another sttory of how difficult life was in Hardy's life span and  how the classes of people were very much divided.

2265676,5,B00094AS90,"This film is a sublimely gentle presentation of a lesser known Hardy novel, and like allmost all Hardy novels it is deeply tragic and subtle. There are no simplistic villians or strong heroes here only deeply flawed souls trying and often failing in their various endevours...

A loving father sends his daughter off to receive a better education than the rural 'Wessex' countryside can offer her. The father's shame over his own ignorance drives him to push her - creating a young lady neither at home in the city or the countryside, not really accepted by ""society"" or by the earthy woodsmen and farmers of her village. Her father - once happy to see her married to a gentle woodsman (Rufus Sewell) now decides that she would be 'wasted' in such a match and encourages the newly arrived village Doctor to court her. But the Doctor resents the cloying countryside world and has little but contempt for her friends or her family. Her ex fiance seems unable to resolve himself to their ended relationship. Both he and the young lady are manipulated by others into more and more untennable situations, until the inevitable doom at the heart of all Hardy novels - a stupid and pointless death - crushes the options for the central characters.

While this version of the film lacks the depth of the book, stunning performances by Polly Walker and Rufus Sewell make this well worth the effort. Although the end of this film seemed more ""modern"" that my memories of the novel, I do recommend this highly!

It's quiet,almost annoyingly slow pacing, and its highly predictable situations - unhappy affairs - unrequited loves - severe ilness - tragic miscommunications - in no way distract from the charm of the production.

If you are looking for action, adventure, or full frontal nudity this is NOT the film for you - but if you desire deep and terrible beauty, bittersweet,fine and moving performances - stop in these woods and enjoy.",1339113600,13,1929,4.801204819277109

2265680,1,B00094AS90,"If you're even vaguely entertaining the notion that this is a Rufus Sewell movie, think again.  He plods around the beginning of the movie and dies at the end, and is otherwise less actively involved than a guest appearance by Batman.

There are slowly paced movies that unravel characters and plots with grace, then there are turgidly paced movies with deliberately lingering shots that could put a hurricane to sleep.  As I droned through this film, I wondered if there was anyone one earth who actually enjoyed it without confusing it with a dull night's sleep.  One can't help sympathize with the female lead, hate the male lead (who really really really isn't Rufus Sewell) and wonder whether the plot was left on the cutting room floor.  This may have been adapted from a very good book which I haven't read; having watched this thick pudding, I'd rather reread Harry Potter.",1283126400,3,881,4.80794701986755

Nothing really memorable in the way of acting, setting, or music, though none of these were particularly bad.
