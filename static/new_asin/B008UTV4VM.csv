5183618,3,B008UTV4VM,"""I just don't want Bobby to end up like me and you."" Olive (Jovovich) is a single mother/con-artist who is trying her best to raise her son Bobby as best as she can. Bobby starts to act up in class but Olive doesn't see anything wrong with what Bobby does. When a freak accident causes Kent (Pullman) to come into their lives Bobby has a chance at a better life, but Olive has a choice to make. This is not a bad movie at all but it is another movie that has a lot of heart but really nothing else. It's not a total nothing movie because there is a plot but it has the feel of a movie that is just made in order to spend money. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie because I did enjoy it and it was a decent watch, but don't expect anything that will make you think. There really is nothing else to say about this other then that. Overall, a decent watch but nothing amazing. I give it a B-.",1348963200,,894,3.9447513812154695

8530618,3,B008UTV4VM,"Olive (Milla Jovovich) is of European descent living as a scam artist in America. Her accents vary as she both scams and raises her 10 year old son Bobby (Spencer List). Olive coddles her son and indulges his bad behavior which she seems to enjoy. The film is divided into two parts. The first part is all fun and games. The second half is after Olive gets caught and is released from jail. During the interim, Bobby was adopted by a rich real estate man (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Marcia Cross). When Bobby is around his mom, he acts up. Oh yes, they both like to act out and quote films which didn't figure into the script like it should.

Written and directed by  Famke Janssen, she appeared to have written the lead role for herself. While this was designed to be a quirky film, it tries too hard with stereotyped characters that it fails.  Bobby is a complex character who exhibits both independence and insecurity. He is the forgotten son we needed to get to know, but didn't because the film was all about her. So in the end, I felt nothing when I should of had a Puffs moment.

8530619,1,B008UTV4VM,"Earnest performances by Milla Jovovich and Bill Pullman can't save this dreadful script and amateurish direction from actress who-should-never-write-or-direct-again Famke Janssen.  The story is one you've seen many times before (and better executed): N'er-do-well mother must decide if she can do the right thing and leave her child with more stable parents or subject her child to a life of chaos.

The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of the mother, Olive, played by Milla Jovovich (who, to her credit, swings for the fences as always).  What little information we're given about Olive's history would give license to every single mother to become a grifter.  She is from another country, but that serves no purpose to the story other than force us to listen to Jovovich deliver every line in an accent.  As a result, we don't have a reason to sympathize with someone who is nothing more than a manipulative user of people.  When she (or her child) were faced with a crisis, I found myself rooting AGAINST them.  I wanted MORE tragedy to befall them, not less.

And holy, jumping, heck... who do we blame for that Bobby character?  Is it the way Spencer List is portraying him, or is it the director's fault?  In any respect, he does not act age appropriate... in that he acts way too immature for his physical age.  One might say that a life of uncertainty has hindered development, but this would force him to become MORE savvy, not less.  As it is, someone was trying too hard to turn this kid into Dennis the Menace, but without any of the charm (the comic strip version, not the movie version).

As to the secondary characters, I am the first to acknowledge that Oklahoma is behind the times, particularly when it comes to social issues.  However, these people were caricatures.  Most men in this movie were feeble-minded fundamentalists who were easily swayed by Olive's highly-questionable charms.  And as charming as Mila Jovovich is, her character was nothing that would have men falling all over themselves in this way... I don't care HOW small the town was!

Finally, if you are going to write about a specific place (ie., Oklahoma) and have specific things about that place be plot points, you should probably make sure you are factually accurate.  (1) There is no ""Class B"" misdemeanor in Oklahoma; (2) Children CAN be prosecuted as juvenile delinquents (this has been the case for decades) and most importantly, (3) ADOPTIONS ARE NOT TEMPORARY!  Adoptions are final decrees and after a short period for appeals, can only be vacated if there is fraud or duress or something that would render the adoption invalid.  I found it hilarious that the richest guy in town had lawyers who didn't know enough about basic family law to tell them that a Guardianship would have resolved all their problems.  Finally, someone needs to talk to an immigration attorney, because the cop was giving out really bad and inaccurate information.

What I found particularly painful is that everyone was acting like raising this brat would be the greatest privilege ever (I think Adoptive Mom called it ""the greatest gift"") and he's the kind of kid you'd relinquish to the State if the State would take him.

And the ending... well, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but let's just say it wasn't worth the journey.  At one point, we were SURE we had been watching this movie for a solid two hours, and it had only been 80 minutes.  'Nuff said.

In short, this is a dreadful, dreadful film made by well-intended folks who should get together and buy every copy to make sure it is never seen again.",1391385600,5,3617,4.756410256410256

8530622,5,B008UTV4VM,"Considering the small amount of reviews this movie has been getting so far, I have to say, it's surprisingly underrated and totally worth viewing.  It's a relatively simple story about the *gorgeous* Milla Jovovich playing the character of a con artist that eventually goes to jail and, upon release, has to give up her 11-year old son (named Bobby) to another family.  The two families decide what's best for this boy, and visitation rights go back and forth between the family and Milla's character with their own dilemmas.  The biggest problem is that Milla keeps getting involved with terrible people and Bobby can't behave.

I'm surprised how well-told of a story this is.  The first half of the movie is more along the lines of subtle comedy with Milla dressing up in really beautiful red dresses (finger-bitingly beautiful, haha) and meeting new people (including a boyfriend and religious neighbor).  Bobby the son is really cruel and mature for his age which leads to several hilarious moments between him and others.  The second half is emotionally dramatic.  A VERY different change of tone.  Bringing Up Bobby does a great job alternating between the two genres (comedy and drama) without losing its magic.  It's basically about a mother and son determined to keep a relationship together no matter what kind of obstacles stand in their way.

It's probably a 4-star movie but because it's unknown to the average movie watcher, I feel an extra star is needed so it's now officially a 5-star film.  Highly recommended.",1361491200,,1528,4.97244094488189
8530623,4,B008UTV4VM,"`Bringing up Bobby' is a movie about Olive, a con artist from some Eastern European country and the son she has, who was born in America. The acting is done well. One can see the complete love she has for her son.
This somehow resembles an obscure 1940's movie I once saw; where a poor woman is left with the decision to give her son a better life by leaving him with a rich childless couple. Olive becomes tangled in the same situation. A rich man hits Bobby with his car and agrees to foster care for him when she is put in jail. The ending is so inconclusive it almost invalidates all the emotions that have gone before; but it is still a small movie that can be of interest.

There are no subtitles and at points, Olive's accent makes understanding everything she says difficult.
There are extras of the writer/director's commentary, a short film - on location with the cast and a question and answer session, and the trailer of the movie. The movie is about 95 minutes long.",1359590400,,979,4.4088397790055245
8530624,4,B008UTV4VM,"The reviewer who thought this one was all about the money wasn't paying attention.  This is Famke Janssen's project start to finish, she wrote the screenplay, produced and directed.  And while it might seem like Paper Moon revisited, the cast makes this movie.  Not every actress can pull off playing a con artist with a Ukrainian accent without turning the performance into a farce.  Milla makes you feel Olive's love for Bobby and to get how she got to be who she is across without beating it to death.  Bill Pullman and Marcia Cross bring depth to the wealthy couple who have issues of their own, but truly want to help. Spencer List as Bobby manages to be a real kid without making you hate him when he's a brat or over-playing the pathos.  This is a very good movie.",1354060800,4,771,4.4714285714285715
8530625,5,B008UTV4VM,"The trailer made ""Bringing Up Bobby"" look interesting, but now that I've watched the entire movie, I can recommended it to anyone over 18 (just the occasional bad language). There's the well-written humor, quirky characters and (unexpectedly) a nice depth of character development and a happy final outcome. ""Bringing Up Bobby"" is a WINNER!",1350950400,,340,5.314814814814815
