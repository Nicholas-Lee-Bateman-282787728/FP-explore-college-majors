2257290,2,B00083FZGI,"Yes this was a D movie dont' waste your time on it. Its very cliche, the acting isn't very good. This is a cheap rip off of Secret Window. Its not funny, not very scary just stupid. Don't waste your time on this garbage. The cover art on the dvd is catchy it makes you want to see what the movies about, a mere marketing scheme. Please don't even rent you'll be sorry you did! Read my other reviews for better movies.",1120694400,,417,4.097560975609756
2257291,2,B00083FZGI,"The acting in this was way better than I thought it would be, and so was the picture and sound quality. You never know what you will get with these B horror movies. The movie seems interesting enough to hold you attention for a little while, but then it starts dragging towards the end. The FX are definitely nothing special, but not as cheesy as your normal B horror, but still a tad bit generic (ex: the main evil force looks like a rip off of the girl from Species). Unfortunately, this movie reeks of the ""been here, done this"" dejavu feeling. It's a movie you will watch and forget, it doesn't have too many memorable scenes. I also thought it was a tad bit generic when the main evil force in the movie was Satan himself. Couldn't they have come up with something a little more original? I am also not a big fan of dream sequences in movies unless they are done very well. Verdict: it might be worth a rental if your bored, but there are better horror movies out there. It's not bad enough to where you will turn it off half way through watching it, but it is not good enough to watch twice either. It had some good gore in it, however the gore it did show was reflected on several times (repeatedly shown), so you actually see some of the same scenes over and over again. MORE GORE PLEASE!",1119398400,,1296,4.272357723577236
2257292,1,B00083FZGI,"Everything about this movie is awful. Nothing redeeming... The acting is terrible.. the script is complete nonsense, the directing is bland and unremarkable. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some terrible movies. This blows them all away. Usually I can laugh at movies when they're really bad, there's nothing laughable about this garbage. I wouldn't even know where to begin... No suspense at all. Sickeningly bad. Save yourself the trauma and skip it. I've also noticed that the only people who like this movie at all seem to be obsessed with the lead actor in a really scary and sad way. Avoid this like the plague.",1118966400,3,639,4.7657657657657655
2257293,5,B00083FZGI,"Unlike other films that you feel sorry you saw/rented/bought, THIS movie is definitely worth viewing/purchasing.

Though, it may not be pee-in-the-pants scary, it's intriguing and attention-grabbing.

I'm just sorry it wasn't in theaters, in place of some movies not so worthy of being there. Plus, the fact of seeing Jensen Ackles' enlarged wouldn't be too bad either..... ;-)

Now, get off your rump and GET IT NOW. GO! (or order it-- whatever your preference)",1118448000,,462,5.216216216216216
2257294,3,B00083FZGI,"I wasn't expecting much when I slapped 'Devour' into the old DVD player.  I have been used and abused a hundred times over by straight-to-DVD horror flicks.  But I was surprised by 'Devour'.  Not in its story, which is pretty basic, but by the fact that this lower budget flick actually had some decent acting in it.

Jensen Ackles stars as a Freddie Prinze-wannabe, but Ackles is a million times less irritating, who plays some internet game that is controlled by Satan.  Yeah, you've seen this before and in 'Devour' its not much different.  His friends die, his wacky tarot card-reading girlfriend helps him investigate, he finds out Satan is his mommy, etc.  There's nothing new or original here, but the film is shot, edited, acted well, and the FX are done nicely for a lower budget flick.  The best thing about the film is the great, though unfortunately short, supporting role of a former Satanist played by William 'Demon Knight' Sadler.  Sadler is really good in his few minutes of screentime.  I wish that guy would get more roles...

Like I said before, 'Devour' will not surprise you.  The makers of the film try to throw in some plot twists, but they're pretty generic.  They try to leave you with a cliffhanger ending, but again its generic.  The thing that 'Devour' does deliver though is a well put together film, with good performances and likable characters.  When you put all that together, you may not get a groundbreaker but you do get a watchable film and not a bad way to spend an hour-and-a-half.",1117670400,2,1521,4.686792452830189
2257295,2,B00083FZGI,"Nightmares are a common phenomenon among people, as fear comes crawling during the hours of deep sleep.  These bad dreams bring about terror, horror, and other anxiety ridden matters.  However, when nightmares haunt a person during the wake hours it could turn a life upside down.  The instances when visions and dreams come during the conscious moments are often connected hallucinations.  People that experience hallucinations usually are connected with schizophrenia and delusional disorders.  On the other hand, in this story the audience will see terrifying reveries in a wide awake state.

Devour opens with a young man with a camouflage jacket and a hunting rifle wandering the woods when a wild beast attacks him. This man is Jake Cummings (Jensen Ackles) whose hazy identity begins to unveil from the opening scene.  However, one things is certain as Jake shares with the audience in his thoughts that he frequently experiences vivid nightmarish daydreams that he does not seem to be able to shake off.  Jake is also a college student who has just turned 21 and he is ready to go head to head with all the freedoms that come with his age together with his friends Dakota (Dominique Swain) and Conrad (Teach).

When Jake does not hangout with his friends he works at a computer store where he also meets the attractive Marisol (Shannyn Sossamon). At home he lives with his father with whom he has a strained, but a fatherly relationship.  Marisol works at the nursing home that takes care of Jake's quadriplegic mother where he also meets her.  Soon the two find each other, as they begin to fall in love.

One of the things that the three friends come across due to Conrad's birthday present to Jake is a website called the Pathway.  The Pathway contacts its members with different and often bizarre tasks to accomplish.  Initially, it seems harmless, but it soon turns dark and dangerous.  The events begin to turn increasingly more bizarre, as they eventually lead to death and destruction.  In the middle of this horrific mess Jake finds himself seeking comfort and help from his new girlfriend Marisol, as he tries to solve the mystery behind the Pathway.

Devour initially has a fascinating premise that actually keeps the audience interested in the story, as it discloses the element of conscious nightmares.  However, this premise turns into a muddled confusion, as too many plots and themes begin to intertwine in a delusional manner.  There is also an obvious use of iconic horror elements from other horror films such as the Hitcher (1986) and Ichi the Killer (2001).  Moreover, there are moments when the characters maneuver themselves with difficulty through the film and script.  Nonetheless, there are few moments when the film shows some promise and horror, but unfortunately the director David Winkler does not taking any risks.  This leaves the audience with a conventional horror story that feels flat and used, as it it eventually offers a gawky cinematic experience.",1117584000,22,2995,4.995967741935484

2257324,4,B00083FZGI,"Yeah, so I have to admit that I only watched this movie because it had Jensen Ackles in it (guilty) but I have to say that I do adore this movie. That is probably because I love B rated horror. This isn't a mainstream popular horror movie, but it has an interesting plot and some actors that I was pleased to see. We all do the ""hey it's that chick, hey it's that guy"" thing, and I was totally guilty of that more than once in this movie. All in all if you are a fan of b rated horror I say give this one a try. It's pretty great. The ending wasn't all that good, but usually with b rated horror it never is.",1429228800,,608,3.872

I don't want to spoil anything that happens in the film but I will warn you that its in my opinion very dark and twisted if you watch it you will understand what I mean.

2257329,5,B00083FZGI,You would expect a horror movie made in 2005 to be extremely cheesy but this was great. All of the actors delivered... all of them. It is great to see a cast that takes their work seriously - especially in horror - of which most tends to consist of bad actors or actors who just don't want to take the job seriously. The effects weren't the best I've seen but the plot twists and story line definitely made up for that.,1426118400,,419,4.185185185185185

Then, everything changed and people were just dying left and right for no reason. The movie was just about finding the reason why people were dying. At the end of the movie, it didn't tell you the reason either. So, it lets you figure that part out yourself and you have no idea if you're right or not.

From the back cover you can tell Satan is involved in this somewhere. The acting was stronger than most B horror movies. The plot moves along at a good clip without many slow scenes.

2257376,5,B00083FZGI,"i put off seeing this movie for months for two reasons:  1)  bad reviews and 2)  i don't do horror flicks, and this one was supposed to be pretty bad.

in short, i am really, really sorry i waited.

the reason i finally rented the movie (and now i've just ordered a copy for my very own) was because of the supernatural hiatus for 3 wks. this september between the final airing of the summer re-runs and the beginning of the new season.

i needed a jensen fix, in a pretty bad way.

in short, the movie was refreshing, maybe because i wasn't expecting much.  jensen's acting is superb, as expected, but i was surprised and pleased to see him playing a part that, while there are obvious similarities to the show supernatural, is very unlike the character he plays, dean.  jake gray is much more like *sam.*

i highly recommend the movie.  jensen's father, alan ackles, plays his father in the movie, and their scenes are quietly riveting.  maybe i have just come to expect deep, heartfelt acting from this talented family, and i was not disappointed.  i found jake's relationship with his troubled friends, especially the girl dakota, to be caring and supportive.  the passion he brings to the part of jake is notable also because it is difficult to picture anyone else doing as well in this role, with the possible exception of ed norton.

i give it a well-deserved 5 stars --again, more because i was so pleasantly surprised, and the horror scenes, while pretty gruesome, did not detract from the overall story.",1190246400,5,1513,4.614232209737827

Also, though the story isn't the most original and some characters come and go leaving you going what?! the acting isn't that bad.

I actually really enjoyed this movie. No, it doesn't take risks, but sometimes that's just fine. Having high expectations for b-list movies is a gamble anyway.

Ultimately, if you enjoy campy horror movies (guilty) or Jensen Ackles (again, guilty) you'll definitely take pleasure out of watching this movie.

However, the ending threw me so much (wondering ""how did they DO that?!"") that I had to play it again, and the second time around, it was actually riveting.

The acting was fine.  I believe Jensen Ackles is a terrific actor and hope he can find a movie that will make people see what his fans already do but this movie will not be it.  It was lacking substance and was slow in many areas.  The special effects were very good and the ""tongue scene"" was gross.

I am almost disappointed that I purchased this movie as opposed to renting it.  I tried to rent it but my local video store didn't even carry it.  Oh well.  I'll have something to look back upon whenever Supernatural is in it's 5th season! (I'm hoping!)",1158192000,5,836,4.227848101265823
2257386,3,B00083FZGI,"Director David Winkler's DEVOUR is a stylish, if somewhat convoluted and muddled horror thriller.  Jensen Ackens plays Jake, a young man troubled with vivid nightmares.  For his birthday, his closest friend has signed him on to a web site called The Pathway, which supposedly asks you to do some rather bizarre things.  Jake is dismayed when it appears murder is one of those things.  Jake has an old girlfriend/friend, played seductively by Dominique Swain and he hooks up too with a lovely nurse/fortune teller named Merasol, played by the lovely Shannyn Sossamon (A KNIGHT'S TALE, THE ORDER).  Veteran character actor Bill Sadler has a small role as a satanist whose wife figures into the mix.

It's all pretty heady stuff with a few suspenseful scenes; however, it's failure to commit to what exactly has been going on with Jake leaves a little disappointment.",1155340800,2,864,5.006993006993007
2257387,2,B00083FZGI,"Somewhere deep inside the messy script of `Devour' straight-to-video occult thriller, a better and more interesting story is buried. Sadly director David Winkler never seems aware of that, and instead of finding and making good use of it, he makes the entire film more confusing and ridiculous with unnecessary additions.

For example, let's see the film's young hero, college student Jake (Jensen Ackles), who sometimes sees waking nightmares. The theme of seeing weird visions is conventional, but could still be interesting with atmosphere and mystery. Sadly there is none of them here. Instead, all you can see is very poorly-shot, red-colored images that are not exactly scary or chilling. Jake's nightmares about the beast or killing actually offer nothing intriguing especially when these images fail to function as neither scares nor foreshadowing.

So the film adds another mystery factor, which again falls flat. Jake also signs up for the strange online `game' at the site named `The Pathway.' Jake receives a call from `The Pathway' and the voice over the phone can tells, or tempts, the game's participants to do what they really want to do. We are told the consequences could be gory deaths, but the idea is hardly credible and effective because the film says it is a deadly game while we don't know any rules about it. After all, if you don't like playing the game, why don't you  just hang up the phone and forget it?

Shannyn Sossamon appears as Marisol, Jake's new girlfriend, role of a `good girl' making a contrast to Dominique Swain's character Dakota, one of Jake's friends (and probably former girlfriend), whose wild behaviors look often incredible. Both ladies are nice to look at, and that's all I can say about their roles.

The film rather hurriedly concludes with hackneyed ideas that have been used in the occult thrillers, but none of them works with mediocre direction. The `surprise' ending is hugely disappointing with the incomprehensible twist, and frankly, anyway we don't care. We don't care what happened to Jake, and in fact we stop caring long before the ending, after watching the cheesy effects of the deadly beast and a burning house, which betrays the lack of enthusiasm on the side of the filmmakers.",1148428800,6,2246,5.010723860589812

I DID enjoy watching due to its constant twists and good cast. I liked it for the fact that the movie gets darker and meaner as it goes. It has a pretty original plot and follows pretty well. 4 out of 5 stars because the ending wasn't on par with the rest of the movie.",1147305600,11,570,4.287037037037037

Sad sad horror wanna be delivers no goods and a wast of a perfectly good cast, well Shannyn Sossoman (40 Days and 40 Nights, The Order) and Dominique Swain (Face/Off, Lolita) aren't that good of actresses anyway.

The cast is solid and the production values are decent, but it doesn't offer a whole lot of originality or much else for that matter. Although, the characters and situations remained intresting, the film just seemed to somehow fall apart as time went on. Ultimately the movie ends up being nothing more than the average horror film. The storyline follows Jensen Ackles{WB's Supernatural} character as he's constanly haunted by violent online video game called 'The Pathway'. As the film progresses faimly and friends who also played the game start acting weird and some end up dead, leading us to question whether Jensen is doing these murders or a far more sinister force is behind it. The film has it's fair share of blood and gore, but the dry plot and slow-pacing made the film less than desirable. Overall the film starts out promising, but slowly goes downhill. There's some decent gore and a semi-intresting story if you can get past its fairly slow pace. Worth a rent but I question buying it.",1140480000,,1049,4.769230769230769
2257393,3,B00083FZGI,"Lukewarm pretty much sums this movie up.  You won't exactly devour this movie, but it's certainly palatable.  By playing it safe at every turn, Devour avoids making glaring mistakes, but it also limits itself from doing anything worth getting excited about.  The whole thing is rather formulaic and predictable, so your big payoff at the end consists of little more than a ""Yep, knew it"" moment.  There may be a few elements of very mild suspense, but horror fans won't find much gore here at all - there are a couple of pretty cool deaths, but all we get to see are the staged after-effects.

The premise has been done several times before, but I still like it - and I'm still waiting for someone to really get it right.  The objective is to take a computer game to the next level, combining fantasy and reality in a way that truly tests the ""player"" and usually leaves him surrounded by a lot of dead friends and family members.  Unlike some similar films, though, Devour doesn't go the way of virtual reality.  This particular game revolves around players receiving telephone calls asking them to do things.  Actually, the whole game here is pretty darn vague.  The callers basically just criticize the players' weaknesses in an obvious attempt to make them commit dastardly deeds - particularly acts of vengeance against those who have wronged them.  The only thing resembling a twist here is the fact that the main character, Jake Cummings (Jensen Ackles), is already prone to waking nightmares.

Once he starts playing the game, Jake begins having increasingly violent, waking nightmares of murder and self-mutilation.  Then those around him begin dying in unusual, suspicious, apparently painful ways.  Jake doesn't seem too distraught over anything, but that's mainly because Jensen Ackles has only one facial expression in his repertoire (dazed confusion) - and because he has a brand new girlfriend, Marisol (Shannyn Sossamon), to comfort him.  After attending a few funerals, Jake comes to believe (in a rather substantial logical leap) that Satan is using the game to possess its players.  By this time, we've all learned enough to see exactly where this whole thing is going, but Jake still has to go through all the paces to get us to the end.  There's really nothing surprising or climactic about any of this.

The acting isn't bad, the special effects work reasonably well, and the whole look and feel of the film are perfectly satisfactory - there's just no pizzazz.  Devour takes no risks, so you're never really emotionally invested in anything that happens.  Defensive moviemaking may guard against glaring weaknesses, but it inevitably results in a film that lacks energy and excitement.  Horror movies that don't take risks can rarely be anything more than mildly entertaining.",1126224000,10,2799,4.976344086021506
2257394,3,B00083FZGI,"Another reviewer commented that this was the worst movie ever made...I can only assume he has NOT seen many movies as I could name about a hundred worse movies without breaking a sweat.  That's not to say Devour is good, it's just not awful.  Jensen Ackles (Of Smallville) is Jake, a young college guy who suffers from waking nightmares.  He's haunted by something he saw or found in the woods in these nightmares.  His buddies include a goof off pothead named Martin and a sexually agressive waitress named Dakota who may...or may not be Jake's Girlfriend.

They turn Jake onto an internet game called ""The pathway"".  In a sort of Fear [...] way this game knows everything about its players and calls them on the phone and tells them to do things...or gives advice on taking control of thier lives.  When Jake is fired from his job as a PC repair Tech, the place where he worked is promptly robbed the next day.  The owner blames Jake but security cameras showed the owner and several other men pulling off the crime.  It's never explained what really happened though but this is how the pathway helps it's players.

Jake's daytime nightmares get more violent as he sees himself murdering his father and mutilating his own body.  When Martin is found dead, after shooting an enemy and mutilating himself just how Jake had dreamed he begins delving into just what the pathway is.  It's as this point that a fairly decent thriller takes a turn for the worst and degnerates into some schlock about satanic rituals.  It all ties together pretty poorly in the end.  The performances are pretty good.  These young actors are vets of numerous roles and they come off quite capable.
