960282,3,630507416X,"Writer director Robert Resnikoff's action thriller is about the battle between Lou Diamond Phillips as a LA cop and a serial killer who's mark is the inverted pentagram, which he knives into the flesh of his victims. LDP thinks he has the upper hand when the killer is captured and executed in the gas chamber, not knowing that he will return as an entity with ""the first power"" ie the ability to inhabit the body of others. Therefore the problem arises - how do you stop something that is techically dead? The killer feels a personal connection between LDP and himself and chooses his future victims as people associated with LDP, that is when others with a ""lesser sense of reality"" like the homeless, junkies and drunks, aren't available. Resnikoff gets his biggest laughs when a baglady is possessed and taunts LDP with ""Give us a kiss"" and ""It's not nice to hit a lady"". Resnikoff makes good use of the atmospheric Stewart Copeland music score (nearly as effective as the one he did for Frances Coppola's Rumble Fish) and moves things along pleasingly, taking great satisfaction in the stuntwork, since the killer is remarkeably agile, and adding more of the supernatural in the form of LDP's helper Tracy Griffith as a smarmy red-headed psychic, with partly overcomes the general silliness of the concept. Resnikoff also scores laughs from the killer's grandmother, with Julianna McCarthy giving lines like ""He was not illegitimate"" and ""You're that cop"" a comic hiss. There is also much hissing of cats, optical and aural hallucinations, a demonstration of Griffith's predictive vision and then the playing out of it, an unsafe abandoned water sewer with an available waterslide, and a nun brought in to explain the differences between the first and subsequent powers which hold the key to the destruction of the demon. One might question the logic of running from a being that is able to transport itself to your destination before you can get there, a kind of anti-chase joke, and also firing into a fan when the bullets ricochet off the spinning blades, and Resnikoff overplays the animosity with matching eye closeups. LDP is said to be ""surrounded by a shell"", cynical and nihilistic after the death of his father and perhaps rather burnt out from his third serial killer. However that still doesn't excuse LDP's pugnacious attitude or flat acting. He's the kind of protagonist that you enjoy seeing hurt, and I was grateful that Resnikoff cut his romanctic scene short. However the ending is left unresolved, as if a setup for the sequel.",993772800,16,2551,4.907407407407407

960386,5,630507416X,"a Classic Action thriller from 1989 with Lou Diamond Phillips
Lou Phillips is Detective Logan who goes after serial killer Patrick channing played by Jeff kober
Jeff kober got his inspiration to play the character from serial killer Richard rameriz
who was on trial during the making of the film in 1989
I remember watching this film on VHS back in the day
looking at it now these days, some scenes are funny and ridiculous especially the possession scenes
where Patrick comes back as an evil spirit and possesses some people to tease Logan
original released on DVD over 15 years ago by MGM with only a theatrical trailer as an extra
this MGM DVD is out of print now
so better to buy this new reissue by Kino lorber who has released the film on both dvd & Blu-ray
with new interviews with Lou Diamond Phillips & Jeff kober
the interview with Lou Phillips is very interesting and detailed goes for 30mins
Lou talks about his involvement with the whole film, doing his own stunt work
and also working with other stunt men in the film, working with Jeff kober & Tracy Griffith
also working with his friend David madden
he also talks about lots of memorable behind the scenes stories etc
there's also interview with Jeff kober similar interview to Lou Diamond Phillips interview
goes for about 20mins
both interviews are on both the dvd & Blu-ray versions so you choose which version to buy
I bought the dvd cause it was cheaper cost than the Blu-ray, amazon had the dvd cheaper price $10
the Blu-ray was close to $18
the new Digital remaster 1:85:1 transfer from Kino lorber does look excellent pretty Good sharp & clear quality
obviously the Blu-ray version would be better cause it's High Definition transfer
but each to their own
5 stars for each format based on new interviews & new picture transfers of the film",1448409600,3,1813,4.61609907120743

The interviews were informative and complete. They offered many insights into the making of the film. They were a joy to watch. Why the studio did not mention these interviews in the advertising of the bluray is a mystery. Not only do you get a beautiful transfer of the film, but, the bonus of these outstanding interviews.

960584,5,630507416X,"Scopion Releasing has been sublicensing some real gems lately from Kino Lorber, The First Power being one of them. Scorpion Releasing (ran by Walt Olsen, brother of the notoriously idiosyncratic Bill Olsen of Code Red) have made a name for themselves in the last several years by issuing a lot of wonderful near-forgotten underground horror films (notably Mortuary, Don't Answer The Phone, Satan's Slave). They entered the Blur Ray market with Death Ship (another great release) and now they bring us the criminally underrated satanic panic thriller The First Power.

I remember seeing The First Power on VHS after renting it from my local video store back in the early 90's. Starring b-movie action hero Lou Diamond Phillips and the naturally creepy Jeff Kober, this film has an atmosphere thats is more akin to horror than your basic crime thriller. There is plenty to enjoy here for its modest budget - lots of action, tense moments, and slasher-esque set pieces (like the killer's ritualistic cave - nice touch). I must have rented this film at least a dozen times before it disappeared.

Now it's back in a very clean HD print. Not perfect mind you, but the best it will ever look and I promise you will be happy with the picture quality over your rotting VHS tape. Throw in interviews with Phillips & Kober, and the original one-sheet poster art on the reverse sleeve and you have yourself a winning release, just in time for Halloween.

960625,1,630507416X,"The First Power (Robert Resnikoff, 1990)
[originally posted 12Apr2000]

I'm still trying to figure out what this film is. It was made at a time when Satanism, in film, was still reserved for the heavy hitters, and it has one of those endings that are popular in horror film (think John Carpenter), but that you rarely see outside the genre. So this is either a straight thriller attempting to utilize some of the techniques of horror to get a really slick and original feel, or it's a B-horror film attempting to get some legitimacy by passing itself off as a mystery/thriller/cop flick.

No matter how I slice it, it comes off looking like #2, but as it was Resnikoff's second and last film-- and there's no info on the first at IMDB-- I can't be 100% certain. One thing I DO know, however, is that it manages to combine almost every rising-eighties-star-who's-since-faded-into-nothingness (Lou Diamond Phillips, Tracy Griffith, Dennis Lipscomb, etc.) with every established eighties star whose career was about to collapse (Elizabeth Arlen, Sue Giosa, etc.).

In any case, the plot (thin as it is) pits Russell Logan (Phillips), a police detective, against the same serial killer he caught and executed-- seems Satan has given said serial killer (Jeff Kober) the power of immortality. Thin, huh? And pointless, too. Avoid like the plague. *",1383004800,,1342,4.982142857142857

960688,1,630507416X,"Police Detective Russel Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) thinks that catching serial killer Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) and sending him to the gas chamber will be enough to stop his killing spree. That is, until the killings start again and professional psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith) shows up in his life, insisting that Patrick has been given the ""first power"" by the devil and has used it to rise from the dead.

The plot of ""The First Power"" is very similar to that of ""Fallen"" (which was made in 1998, eight years after ""The First Power""). Both films centre on demonic serial killers who seemingly can't be stopped and who can pass from one body to another. However, ""Fallen"" is far and away the better of the two films (in fact, it is one of the most frightening films that I have ever seen - the song ""Time is on my Side"" still creeps me out, whenever I hear it). ""The First Power"" is the sort of film you would expect to find on late night television or on the bottom shelf of your local DVD store. The concept is a good one (good enough to be reused as ""Fallen""), but the execution is terrible. The acting is laughably bad, particularly on the part of Tracy Griffith (yes, Melanie's sister), and there are so many plot holes and improbabilities, not to mention scenes that just plain confused me, that it's only really worth watching if you're the sort of person who enjoys films that are ""so bad they're good"". Nevertheless, if you are into ""so bad it's good"" films, this stands out in my mind as one of the two most enjoyably bad films that I have ever seen (alongside ""Jade""), so if you do happen to stumble across this film, it might not be a complete waste of your time.",1217721600,4,1688,4.445161290322581

  The plot of a demonic killer is nothing new,but the presentation of Patrick Channing was something quiet different. This young man was destined from birth to follow the left-handed path. Born of an incestuous relationship,he was reared in an environment that did nothing,but encourage him to fall from grace and become the instument of evil. Veteran actor,Jeff Kober,in the role of Channing,armed the character with all the attributes of a Satanic desciple,more than willing to the bidding of the Dark Lord. Channing slaughtered with a glee,showing no mercy to victim,be it,adult or child.

  Enter Detective Russell(Lou Diamond Phillips) Logan,a cop with a history of nabbing serial killers. Logan was having no luck at all with the ""Pentagram Killer"",as Channing was hailed in the press,when psychic Tess Seton(Tracy Griffith) began to have contact with Channing in her own special way-through telepathy.

I know I can't be the only fan of this movie that would love to see how this cop turned out 10 years later and I think not only would Lou Diamond Phillips enjoy the heck out of the role, it would probably do well to reserrect his career.  I doubt Jeff Kober would turn down a chance to come back either.  His character is so memorable as a villain I've put it right up there with Hopkin's Hannibal.  I thought he was that good, his look, his voice, his sick laugh, that cold dead stare...no words, Jeff, you played it perfectly.  When I saw him playing that wimp in Vin Diesel's A Man Apart, I shuttered to think he has to take crappy roles like that now.  He should be a huge player.  I just shrugged it off and invisioned him cutting Diesel ear to ear with that blade of his while saying ""we're going to go through a very small door, and we're going to go through backwards...that's why I say the prayers in reverse.""  Then I look back at the screen only to see Kober cowering and I couldn't buy into it.

Start the sequel off right and kill off that dorky redhead.  She couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  You'd have to bring her back though because it would be an awesome way to get Logan's attention in the story line.  Maybe he's a washed out detective or maybe he's not even a cop at all anymore...then he sees his old psychic love interest just got waxed by somebody that likes to carve inverted pentagrams into his victims...and suddenly he's reminded ""how's the stomach buddy boy?""  Anyone feeling me out there?  Give us a sequel.  It's about darn time!

Anyway, it's all here including the already mentioned awesome score from Copeland.  Just buy this one.  Don't even bother renting it anymore.  You've already spent too much at the video store on it anyways.  You could have owned it 10 times over by now.",1157846400,3,1916,4.343661971830986
960694,4,630507416X,"You can only see a movie for the first time once and so I have to admit that THE FIRST POWER worked on me the first time I saw it in theaters. It moved with such lightning speed that I didn't have time to ponder its snowballing silliness. The director, Robert Resnikoff, knows how to construct an action film--the cinematography is first rate and the editing superb-- he just doesn't know when to stop. There are car chases, horse and buggy chases, foot chases and innumerable shoot-outs, and at one point the killer even brandishes a ceiling fan as a rather laughable weapon and all the action movie huggery-muggery sits rather uneasily on top of the supernatural elements. Lou Diamond Philips, though a tad young-looking to be such a seasoned detective, gives a competent performance. Jeff Kober is obviously having fun playing the killer and it shows; he has a toothy menace that's suitably creepy. Probably the best thing going for THE FIRST POWER is a truly unnerving and effective soundtrack from Stewart Copeland. The director pulls off some nasty mind-trips on the character played by Philips, one where he wakes to find his apartment seemingly covered in blood and another in a confessional booth when he goes to get some answers from a local priest.",1150070400,7,1259,4.833333333333333
960695,4,630507416X,"Lou Diamond Phillips plays an LAPD detective who pursues a serial killer who has somehow obtained ""The First Power"".  Though Phillip's character has nabbed the guy and ensured his execution, a string of brutal murders suggests the perp has come back from the dead.  With the help of a psychic and a nun with an agenda of her own, Phillips comes to realize that the killer has obtained the power to become anybody, go anywhere, and scariest of all - attained immortality.  (The flick tosses in an added chilling detail - the killer communed with the powers of darkness, but it was his execution that sealed his link with the ultimate power.  Phillips tracks the killer with an anonymous tip, one that refuses to cooperate unless he can guarantee that the killer won't face execution.)
This flick is much better than it has the right to be.  The plot tosses in the indestructible annihilator, yet doesn't do much with him - he'll just keep on killing, keeping the heroes alive long enough for them to appreciate his brutality.  The flick tosses in a mystical icon with the power to destroy the first power, but doesn't define what it can do, and spend little time with it.
Still, ""Power"" was a lot of fun.  Good use of mood music and heavy atmospherics create true tension, even in scenes when there shouldn't be any.  (One excellent scene has Phillips visiting the home the killer shared with his elderly mother, one in which he learned the secret root of the killer's evil).  If you want something that will keep you up for a long night, the ""First Power"" can't be beat.",1019779200,18,1570,4.618705035971223
