2034846,3,B0001WTWH4,"Since there is no information about this boxed set on the Amazon web site, I clicked on Internet Movie Database and searched the title.  I came up with a 2006 David Attenborough production.  This isn't it.  I have watched only the section on climate and noticed how old it looked.  Toward the end came a comment, ""in the 90's scientists hope to find out...""  As far as I can tell, this series was made in the 1980's.  Despite its age, I will certainly use the climate part in my college biology course.  It is a fair treatment that emphasizes science.",1151625600,70,551,4.45

8017195,5,B0001WTWH4,"I watched this when I was about 11 and loved it!  I have seen the new series with all the animals, but I still want to own this old series from 1986. It has a lot of cool info about Geology.",1303948800,,190,3.6341463414634148
8017196,4,B0001WTWH4,"The set is from the PBS seven part series of the same name.  Each episode focuses on a particular feature about Planet Earth and relation to it's neighbors and space environment.

The science is solid and still mostly holds up today.  I would recommend this to educators in the elementary schools.
It is not flashy but still visually breathtaking and Richard Kiley's narration is top notch.

My only objection is that the video quality is not as good as I had hoped for.  I have old VCR tapes that playback a lot better than do these DVDs.  But even with that, schools should incorporate these DVDs in their curriculum if they haven't yet done so.",1271203200,,647,4.582608695652174
8017197,4,B0001WTWH4,"This Planet Earth series played on PBS years ago and should not be confused with the new Planet Earth series.  The new series focuses on life on Earth, the older version was about science and discovery.

I was always facinated by this series when it was on TV so I had to purchase it when it came out on DVD. I received the companion book to the series with my contribution to PBS many moons ago.  If you haven't seen it, I would rate it 3 - stars because it is dated, but still interesting.",1231977600,,491,4.147368421052631
8017198,2,B0001WTWH4,"This is a case of buyer beware as there are so many variations of the documentary Planet Earth. This version is ok for the cost although it is a bit outdated due to it's publication release. What made me unhappy was that I was looking for the series that has Sigourney Weaver narrating for my wife as a present and this version was not it. Unfortunately no matter what research I did I was unable to pre-determine who the narrator was ahead of time, but the cost was not too high so I bought it anyway.

If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive series with some great photography then I would recommend it. If you are looking for the latest scientific data then this is not it.",1226361600,,684,4.34375

What's the problem ?",1198108800,,90,4.6875
8017200,3,B0001WTWH4,"Beware: Planet Earth-The Complete Series . . . is NOT . . Planet Earth-The Complete BBC Series.  In my enthusiasm for a $30 Planet Earth 'Complete Series' set I overlooked this not-so-obvious difference and feel burned.  My 1986 series looks and feels very dated tho I'm sure it was very fine for its time.  In it the pacing is rushed, they have funny haircuts, primitive computers and talk about Skylab.",1191369600,10,404,4.742857142857143
8017201,5,B0001WTWH4,"Although not the most recent film on the forces shaping our planet, the Earth, I have found nothing to compare with this explanation of the forces that have shaped geological Earth.  I use it with both English Language Arts and History in middle and high school to set a common understanding of the way the Earth has become the planet we call home.  From this foundation, I can take students around the globe as we read and study how and why people settled where they are, and how the places they live have affected development, and even the flourishing of culture, and the humanities.",1176422400,6,585,4.615384615384615
8017202,5,B0001WTWH4,"Upon further inspection of this title, the other reviewer has it right. This program was a 7-part series which first aired on PBS in the United States during the spring of 1986.  I watched it at the time and it is very good, although now the scientific facts might be a bit outdated.  It's an interesting show nonetheless.  Glad to see that they released it on DVD format...",1162771200,25,374,4.470588235294118
