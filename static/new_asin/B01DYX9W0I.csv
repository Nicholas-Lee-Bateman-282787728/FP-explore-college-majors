7726358,5,B01DYX9W0I,"Quantum cute kitten plus Key and Peele, sensitive straight up guys, drug dealers, team-building in gang drop-outs singing George Michael songs in a mini-van, murder, mayhem, car chases, true love, rescues, gun-fights, self-actualization: what more could you want?",1466553600,2,263,5.947368421052632
7726359,2,B01DYX9W0I,"The movie was good, but it drags in a lot of parts.  And you only see the kitten for a total of 15 mins or so.  Another reviewer said that the problem is the movie's pacing.  I agree.  It was like watching a sketch of theirs that was funny but just went way too long.  But, if you are a Key and Peele fan like me...it is worth a watch.",1466208000,,335,3.7285714285714286

7726361,5,B01DYX9W0I,"Keanu comes from the guys behind Key and Peele and revolves around Rell Williams (Jordan Peele) coping with his recent break up. His cousin Clarence (Keegan Key) stops by to keep him company until Rell finds a lost kitten by his front door, names it Keanu, and starts to feel better as he bonds with Keanu. All of that stops when some gangsters break into his house and kidnaps Keanu, now Rell and Clarence must make themselves look good for a street gang in an effort to find Keanu and take him back home. Keanu is a movie that surprised me quite a bit. I personally haven't seen much of the stuff in Key and Peele but after watching this I really should. There's a lot about Keanu to appreciate, from the comedy all the way to the likeable characters. There are a few jokes that don't quite work but overall I found myself laughing a lot throughout this movie. If you are a fan of Key and Peele, you are definitely going to enjoy it. Even if you haven't seen much of Key and Peele, you'll still have a great time with this movie!",1465516800,2,1031,4.292307692307692
7726362,5,B01DYX9W0I,"This was just a funny movie that had a lot of twists, turns, and suspense moments where you think our protagonists are going to die. When mild-mannered Clarance and Rell find a kitten that belonged to two dangerous killers , they take him in and call him Keanu. But when a gang steals him back, they go undercover in the gang as those same notorious Dresden brothers from Allentown to get him back. Meanwhile, the real Allentown brothers are on the hunt for the same kitten.

The plot is simple, but the comedy and suspense works and the movie ends with a somewhat realistic lesson: consequences for your actions. Just like ""Let's Be Cops"" this is a simple and fun comedy and a much needed break from the usual superhero movies of the past few year/s Just go watch it and enjoy!",1464652800,6,778,4.47887323943662
7726363,4,B01DYX9W0I,"After a shoot out, a kitten shows up at the door of Rell (Jordan Peele) who was just dumped by his girl friend. His cousin Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key ) shows up to comfort him. When drug dealers accidentally rob Rell's house, they take Keanu, the kitten. Rell and Clarence who ""talk like white guys"" pretend to be tough gangsters, putting on a persona. Clarence, now called ""Shark Tank"" is a corporate team builder who uses that ability and his love for George Michael's music to help bring the gang together as they go on a job to prove themselves in order to get back the cat. They are now selling a drug which is like "" [smoking] the crack of God.""

With kittens being more popular than pop stars on U-Tube it was just a matter of time before they get combined into other genres. This was a cute and clever film which made me smile a lot. Even though Jordan Peele co-wrote the film Keegan-Michael Key stole the scenes.

Guide: Plenty of swearing, brief stripper nudity (?)",1464652800,,977,4.48314606741573
7726364,4,B01DYX9W0I,"Have you been tempted by the silly trailers?

Director Peter Atencio (""Key and Peele"") is sticking with what he does best: comedy. This time it's R-rated (language, nudity and violence). Working with actor/writer Jordan Peele (""Key and Peele"") and writer Alex Rubens (""Key and Peele"" - are we seeing a pattern here?) our screening audience howled as we watched a pair of hapless cat lovers (cousins) try to retrieve a kidnapped (kittynapped?) kitten from a street gang by posing as drug dealers. This quickly turns into a profane, violent, and ultimately up-beat outing for Key and Peele.

We enjoyed:
  * Jordan Peele (""Bob's Burgers"") Rell Williams/Techtonic shows us a broken heart mended by the miraculous appearance of a darling little kitten who needs a home. The kitten is hiding out from a shootout between rival gangs. Rell's a photographer.
  * Keegan-Michael Key (""Tomorrowland"") Clarence Goobril/Shark Tank is way out of his comfort zone. His buddy Rell says he talks like Richard Pryor trying to sound like a white guy. Clarence is a buttoned-down nerd who can't seem to assert himself, even when his wife TELLS him to!
  * Will Forte (""Nebraska"") Hulka is Rell's next-door neighbor. He is a drug dealer.
  * Tiffany Haddish (""The Carmichael Show"") Hi-C is a pretty gal capable of unexpected violence. She is the gatekeeper for Cheddar.
  * Method Man (""Trainwreck"") Cheddar makes the rules. No one argues... particularly when his pet python is in the room.
  * Darrell Britt-Gibson (""Californication"") Trunk never expected to wait in a getaway car singing a George Michael tune. (Shark Tank convinced him that George Michael is black!)
  * Luis Guzmn (""Code Black"") Bacon usually goes with Cheddar (...smile...) but what he REALLY wants back in his palatial estate, is his sister's beloved kitten.

As you might expect, much of the acting credit goes to an unnamed actor, that irresistible CAT, working anonymously. I know. I looked, but because several tabbies played him, he remained nameless. By the way, the voice is provided by Keanu Reeves himself!

Watch for that kitty calendar in the final credits, it's brilliant! And remember this Amazon package gives you the Blu-ray, a DVD, AND Digital HD...",1463616000,2,2218,5.0633608815427
7726365,3,B01DYX9W0I,"In my opinion, I think this films only setback is the pacing. It starts with a beautiful slow-mo montage of the cutest kitty in the history of cinema making his escape from a gang shoot out, but then the next forty minutes, while funny at times, is plagued with jokes that fall flat and situations where you are asking yourself, Where are they going with this? It just takes too long for this film to find its footing. Fortunately, thats my only complaint.

Heres the plot  After being dumped by his girlfriend, Rell (Jordan Peele) finds some happiness when a cute kitten, whom he names Keanu, winds up on his doorstep. When Keanu is stolen, Rell recruits his cousin Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) to help find him. They soon learn that a gang leader named Cheddar (Method Man) has Keanu, and he'll only give him back if the two men agree to work for him.

If you're a fan of both Key and Peele, as well as their hysterical television show, it won't be hard for you to enjoy this movie  their debut in the realm of full length features. Halfway through, after the film finally finds its stride, the entertainment and laughter it provokes is constant until the end. Anna Faris, Nia Long, Luiz Guzman and Will Forte are at their best and, as usual, make a ridiculous film even more so with their over the top performances.

In regards to the soundtrack, George Michael fans will be pleased! He happens to be Clarences favorite singer. His songs surround the action in the same way the film Deadpool used Chicago and Juice Newton. Faith, Freedom 90, Father Figure and One More Try - all the hits are present and accounted for. George even makes a bit of a cameo but I shall not spoil the reason, for it is one of the funniest moments found here.

For Key and Peele, its a fine, solid debut. Well above average, but nothing spectacular. Again, I think the pacing issues kind of ruin the enjoyment. But it is still well worth a look.",1463443200,6,1927,4.491428571428571
7726366,4,B01DYX9W0I,"Theatrical review.  I was a little late to Key and Peeles show on Comedy Central but did catch the last couple years.  The sketch where their various characters are introduced at a football all-star game had me laughing so hard I started crying.  I was genuinely sad to see the show go off the air.  Not to worry, because here is a longer sketch with higher production values.  And a very funny premise.

Keanu is the name of a kitten who shows up at Rell Williams (Jordan Peele) front door.  Spending the night out with his best friend Clarence Goobril (Keegan-Michael Key), they return to find Rells home ransacked and Keanu missing.  Evidently his place was mistaken for that of his next door neighbor and drug dealer Hulka (Will Forte).  So the boys are on a mission to find the cute kittie which leads them straight into the den of the drug kingpin, Cheddar (Method Man).

When Rell and Clarence are mistaken for a couple of bad ass ganstas from Allentown, they just go with it.  Their switch from polite suburbanites to gangsters shows what Key and Peele have done for years.  That is, quickly adapting various personas, from their language to physical movements.  What keeps the film from just another sketch is the circumstances and the money put into some nifty action sequences and oh that kittie (7 were used in the production).  As you might expect, the film earns its R rating with plenty of violence, brutal killings, nudity, sex and language.  It is also funny as hell.  Recommended.",1462147200,36,1498,4.681992337164751

Given, sketch jokes are much easier to do - you get in and get out once you've run out of jokes - but fair warning, this film was more like a joke per 10 minute period. They rely on the core concept (that this action film is entirely about saving a kitten) to be funny long after that joke has ended - so, if you want to stretch it more, you'll have more fun if you're altered.",1487116800,,527,4.0285714285714285

7726581,1,B01DYX9W0I,"I just got bored lately and watched this movie figuring that it might be cute, light-hearted, or at least have some redemption to it based on some charm from the cute little titular kitten Keanu.  Well not one of those elements ever proved forthcoming in the least bit.

There's not a whole bunch to be said about this movie in general.  It focuses on two cousins; Rell and Clarence of whom come accrossed a cute little kitten that Rell names Keanu.  No sooner does Rell take little Keanu in then someone snatches Keanu.  What results from the cousins search for Keanu the kitten is them running afoul with some gangsters as well as some gangsters in training, an unstable coke addicted Anna Faris, and a Mexican gang all while trying to get Rell's beloved kitten back.

That's the best that I can describe the movie without giving away too much.  At any rate this movie is just one unevenly paced, incoherent, horribly written and acted, not even remotely funny(not even once), pointless, lacking in even a semblance of a true plot, total and utter waste of one's personally valuable time.

I swear the vast majority of the time it was all together unclear what the f*** was going on in this movie.  As slow and plodding as this turkey was more often than not, it was painfully hard to even stay awake during it.  Why should they even bother to have the cat in this movie and much less name the movie after it if it has next to no part in the movie all told.  The two main guys( better known as tv's Key and Peele) played characters that were both highly annoying, complete morons, that showed no capabilities to draw conclusions about anything, were foolishly willing to go through a barrage of gang violence just for a cat,  and worst of all every single one of the characters in this movie were  extremely flat; especially the two main characters.  In this case not even one-dimensional; more like zero-dimensional.  The ending to this movie was not only decidedly tough to comprehend but the last 5 minutes were really dragged right through the dirt.

All in all, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this terrible turdfest at all.  It's not funny, it's not clever, the plot makes absolutely no sense in the least, the pace is slow and plodding most of the time with an occasional fast scene, the acting is garbage, the script is complete and utter dogs***, the characters are all dull and flat, the cat plays almost no part in the whole course of the movie, the nudity was too far off the focus of the camera, the action was not only cut too much but what action you get isn't especially all that exciting.  This year has had far too many train wrecks over the course of it but all things considered, this one was by far the most moronic and lacking in focus all year.",1482364800,,2778,4.522

7726614,5,B01DYX9W0I,"Having never seen Key & Peele, I wasn't certain how this movie was going to play out but the appeal of the kitten in the previews made me risk renting it.

This movie is so funny! It's definitely a satire on the gangsta films and it is hilarious.

The premise is simple:  Keanu is a kitten owned by a drug dealer who gets killed first thing. He's adopted by a good-off and is subsequently kidnapped by  the hit men who killed the original owner.  Owner #2 with his cousin set out to find Keanu and the laughs follow.  The reason everyone wants Keanu isn't revealed until the end.

Though our heroes are great, with perfect comedic timing, the kitten is the real star of the show. It's amazing how something so frail and fragile-looking (he probably doesn't weigh a pound) can carry a movie.  The whole idea is ridiculous but the cast carried it off nicely with a happy ending for all.

After this, I'll be on the look-out for more Peele & Key movies.",1481328000,,950,4.382857142857143

There are some funny scenes scattered throughout the movie but this plays more like an action movie with a silly story more than a comedy.  I am a fan of Keegan-Michael Key from back in the day when he was in Mad TV and like his silly humor and he is good at playing silly characters and does ok here.  The problem is the story doesnt have enough humor with only a few scenes that made me laugh.  The George Michael jokes were funny the first couple minutes but grew tiring by the end of the movie.

Unfortunately, a silly plot and storyline that is intended to be a comedy but plays more like an action movie ends up just being a silly action movie.  I really think that if they brought more humor into the movie with less violent action, this would have been a much better movie overall.  This is an ok popcorn movie, time waster but is not one where I am going to remember any tremendously funny scene or funny line as there really wasn't any.

It does drag on and by the closing, it feels like I could have spent 2 hrs doing something more satisfying.  I thought the mere idea of an R-rated ""cat video"" amusing in and of itself, and it does indeed deserve it's R rating, mainly for violence, but of course it's also got a little bit of sexual stuff thrown in and ""adult language"" (aka ""bad words"").  It's far from the best film of 2016, regardless of how you think the Comedy genre sits on the genre hierarchy...at least I hope it's not -- I haven't been able to see all that 2016 has (so far) to offer, I don't remember if I've seen a better film dated from this year, but if this is the best of 2016, that's pretty sad.  Looking back on 2007, I can easily see why NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, a somewhat mediocre film, won the Best Picture award from The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences.

Although there were funny parts, which earned it the two stars from me, it wasn't nearly as funny as I was anticipating, and it had much more action, violence, and repeated use of the n-word than I was anticipating. The actual plot was vapor thin, yet it still managed to have plot holes as deep as chasms. My son had a hard time following what was happening and why, and by the end we were both left scratching our heads by what we had just watched. I think I would have enjoyed it more watching it on my own, but not by much. Pretty sure you would have to be high to write or enjoy watching this movie. I agree with the consensus that the best aspects of the movie were the chemistry and dialogue between the leads, the George Michael moments, and Keanu himself. Everything else was filler. Really strange, intermittently violent, over the top filler. I'm also now scratching my head at the number of glowing reviews and ""must see"" comments left by other reviewers.

They of course get themselves in way too deep to just walk away and have to ride out the night, show their experience and teach the crew they've visited how to do things, when they do they will be given the kitten as a mark of respect gesture.  Of course it's not realistic at all, but it is a lot of fun.

On the region 4 DVD you get a nice mokumentary called Keanu My First Movie.  Where the main human actors talk to the new actor (the kitten) about acting and the perils of acting like a diva and things like this.  There's also a heap of deleted scenes and a gag reel.",1474416000,,771,4.086092715231788

Now this was a very funny  movie but you have to pay attention to all the subtle nuances in this movie. First of all, there is no more adorable kitten in the world than Keanu.

Clever plot, action packed and besides the very funny lines, the three main actors (I include the kitty here) are  full of personality and charm - more than enough to carry off a silly caper film like this on the big screen.

It was so boring: Drugs, shootings, nudity, profanity, and a B-rated plot. You'll be desensitized to the ""n-word"" by the end of the movie. Okay, the kitten was cute, and the last five minutes of the movie were cute. Basically, it's like somebody had this great idea for a movie that involved rival gangs fighting over a cat, and two wannabes that are instantly accepted by hard core gang bangers. The movie had no credibility. I think the writer must have gotten stoned because he was disappointed that this rap song floundered, so he tried to make the song into a movie, and through in a kitten for good measure. This should have been included with Amazon Prime, although it still would have been disappointing even if I hadn't paid $6 to watch it. Hopefully, my coworker won't asked me if I've watched it yet.

The two main characters are professionals living in the suburbs, one slightly more well off than the other. Their way of presenting themselves is coded as white, what some people would call a sell-out. They fall into an absurd situation that puts them in the middle of a gang war, forcing them to ""turn on the black."" Juxtaposing extremes in class status and racial identity are Key and Peele's specialty, and they do pull off some funny moments. Still, I was expecting it to be a lot funnier than it was. And thematically, there were some loose strands. I think they were trying to handle too many ideas at once.

Like much of the movie it was disjointed and senseless.  I get it was intended (I think) as a satire at the expense of California, drug dealing gangsters.  And it was meant to pull the stereotypes front and center and ridicule.  It was a weak attempt at it.  The idea was a good one, there was a faint glimmer of Peele and Key's comedic brilliance, but not enough.  I hope the next big screen effort by these two who are without a doubt two of the best comedians out there uses their writing, directing, ideas and performing ability better. I have not given up on them. But this movie was unfortunately a disappointment.  Key and Peele are brilliant, hilarious performers.  They have proven time and time again they are of the best in their genre. This film fell far short of expectations.  Silly is fine in small doses but stupid must be sprinkled in carefully for fear the whole effort doesn't appear just plain dumb.  Still love them though.",1471737600,2,1089,4.482233502538071

""That's the cutest cat I've ever seen in my life""  - Clarence

Four DETERMINED Stars. ""From the visionary minds of Key & Peele"", indeed.  In the movie ""Keanu"", there is a double-case of mistaken identity, as two middle-class nerdy cousins attempt to locate and retrieve a missing kitten by going undercover to trick the local version of a street gang into giving him up. But the tables get turned. Full of funny moments, amid repeated blatant racially-charged epithets, things humorously go from bad to worst for the cousins, but the cute little kitten is apparently worth going through danger, deceit, the Blips, and George Michael. And this is not the first time the kitten has gone missing. Starring Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key, Tiffany Haddish, Method Man, Nia Long, Will Forte, and Luis Guzmn. Directed by Peter Atencio. Four QUIRKY Stars. (Warner Bros. Pictures. New Line Cinema. Rated R. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray. Time-1:39:43.)",1471392000,4,938,5.077922077922078

7727236,5,B01DYX9W0I,"First and foremost, just because an adorable kitten is the title character does not make this a movie for children. Lots of violence, nudity, swearing and drug usage occur frequently in this movie, so don't watch this movie if any of that will bother you.

""Keanu"" seems like it could be on the sketch comedy show ""Key and Peele"". (If you missed that show, please stop depriving yourself and buy it ASAP.)  The movie opens with massive gang warfare perpetrated by the Allentown gang, which seems to consist of two really bad dudes. Keanu happens to be the drug dealer's kitten, who runs off during all the shooting and turns up on  Rell's  (Jordan Peele) doorstep. Rell is in a meltdown as he has just been dumped by his girlfriend and is crying on the phone to Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key), his cousin.  Rell seems suicidal but Keanu shows up and everything changes. Life is sunshine and lollipops - that  is before Rell's home gets ransacked in a robbery. Somebody steals Keanu and Rell and Clarence are determined to get him back.
Of course, this leads Clarence and Rell into places like the HPV club and the drug dealers that use the club to launder their money. Next time we see Keanu, he is in ""gangsta"" garb - sitting with his new drug dealer owner played by Method Man. And the drug dealer does not want to give or sell Keanu back to Rell. What follows is a test for Rell and Clarence to ""earn""  Keanu back, which of course involves more drug dealers, Hollywood crazies (great job, Anna Farris) and George Michael. Yes, the singer George Michael, who else could it be?

I recommend this movie highly to anyone who loved the ""Key and Peele"" show or anybody looking for a very funny movie. The kitten is adorable, Clarence and Rell are adorable nerds and George Michael - well, he's George Michael, what else can I say.",1471046400,,1826,4.562691131498471

7727259,4,B01DYX9W0I,"What has been achieved here is almost illogical. A couple of what some people would call rather bland characters are going through personal crisis of their own. One day, Keanu, the most charming kitten ever put on a movie, makes an appearance, only to be ""catnapped"" a few days later but not before he has left graphic proof that he is one most charismatic and photogenic four-legged creatures out there.

It becomes apparent that we need to have a striking animal to portray Keanu, or any of his various incarnations. He has vivid, beautiful eyes, and he appears to hit every mark exactly. Our couple of heroes are promptly surrounded by some very nefarious criminals, people who wouldn't think twice before coming up with some nasty resolutions to solve their problems. One of them has fallen for Keanu's charms, and we see how Keanu is properly attired to fit in his new surroundings. Deals are made, things get more and more complicated, with people being quickly eliminated when they pose a problem or become annoying because these bad guys have a very short fuse and jumpy nerves.

Although most of the action is average and predictable, what one enjoys the most is the silliness of the whole thing as our couple of naive characters are soon seduced by their newly found popularity and fame. Here we are some average people attracted to the world of the bad guys, sometimes realizing every action has a consequence, especially as the number of murder keeps going up.

There's a great scene in the middle as one couple of criminals goes into an affluent client's home and is soon involved in a very strange series of games, with Anna Farris doing a great and absurd take on the ultimate crazy millionaire. If this is odd, the induction into the music of George Michael doesn't get any weirder and hilarious. This is what classic comedy is made off, to have the wonders of writing and cinema take you into fresh and unexpected places.

Come in and follow the adventures of a really cute kitten, something that will somehow soften the impact of what otherwise could have a rather pedestrian and a bit intense excursion into a dark and violent world.",1470787200,,2152,4.730666666666667

KEANU isn't terribly ambitious, and the guys don't really have anything in mind other than making us laugh. They have lots of fun playing with racial and cultural stereotypes, reminding us that people are people, and books shouldn't be judged by their covers.

Even better, Key and Peele make a great team; they're right up there with many of the movies' top cinematic comedy duos, playing off each other's personalities with wit and charm. They seem to truly enjoy each other's company, and it's infectious. (Peele co-wrote the screenplay but gave Key the most outrageous character.)

The plot is about two nerds trying to get back a kitten from gangsters, but that it just a device for the weird and hilarious combination of 60-70s Blaxploitation flicks and Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, with a little Dumb & Dumber thrown into it.

The scene where the two leads first enter a down-and-out gangster strip club, dressed like preppy Soccer Dads in Gay clothing, should go down in history as a comedy classic.

My only complaint is much more shots of Keanu, who is the cutest kitten ever!

This would have been terrific as a 1 hour Key & Peele comedy special, but it doesn't quite work as a feature film.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the kitten that played Keanu was absolutely adorable!! That cat was the true star of this movie. And it's precious that Keanu Reeves was the voice of the cat in one scene of the movie.

There were also some misses, the scene at Anna Faris's house dragged on for an eternity.  Unfortunately, they kept rehashing some of the same jokes throughout the entire movie.  They're not as funny the fifth time around, as they are the first.  Keanu deserved more screen time, as he was absolutely freaking adorable.  At the heart of it all, is a man's love for his kitteh, so I can't, in good conscience, trash it.  It was okay, but it could have been great.",1470441600,,699,4.680327868852459

7727326,4,B01DYX9W0I,"Keanu is an action comedy about Rell (Jordan Peele) and Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key), suburban middle-class guys chafing at recent developments. Rell has been dumped and is brooding. Clarences complicated marriage is giving him doubts about his masculinity. When Rells kitten, Keanu, is catnapped, the strait-laced pair try to infiltrate a street gang and retrieve the stolen feline by impersonating ruthless killers. But the kitten becomes so coveted that the fight over his custody touches off a gang war, forcing the duo to turn vigilante.

Most of the humor derives from the culture clash between a couple of suburban black men needing to deal with criminals. Having done five seasons of a TV sketch comedy show, Key and Peele have developed an on-screen chemistry, precise timing, and an ability to play off each other for maximum comic effect. The films silly premise makes their immersion in the world of criminals all the more hilarious. The bad guys are stereotypes, but that allows Key and Peele to riff creatively on trite character traits and behavior. More stringent editing could have eliminated some slow spots but, overall, Keanu moves briskly and has plenty of laughs. If you know the Keanu Reeves film John Wick, which revolves around the death of the central characters dog, youll enjoy an extra level of parody.

Bonus extras on the widescreen Blu-ray release include the featurette Keanu: My First Movie, deleted scenes, and gag reel. A DVD edition with the same extras is also available.",1470096000,,1510,5.109311740890688

Really, the nudity is very small and not that big of an issue. The violence is fake-gruesome, it's over-the-top and made to be funny but for a little kid they wouldn't get it and it would be too much. The biggest issue for kids is the language. There are gratuities F-bombs all over the place. With how kids repeat stuff, do NOT let them see this or you will have a kid saying F--- for ever.

I guarantee this movie does more to clean up ""the hood"" than any Obama initiative.  It portrays all types of people as basically the same at heart, and this is a sweet message, in my opinion.

Also, the plot pivots on a kitten!  A KITTEN!  And it's actually interesting to watch!  That's straight up magic right there.

It's a terrible screenplay, but at least the laughs are there for the first act. After that, it falls into endless re-hashes, basically telling the same two or three jokes against a different backdrop for the length of the picture. I loved these guys on TV, but Keanu doesn't do a great job of highlighting their versatility and eventually goes beyond satire to become exactly the type of movie they're lampooning. Would've made a hilarious five-minute fake trailer on the small screen, which may shine a light on the type of growing pains to expect if they continue this transition to feature-length material.",1469664000,2,809,5.0

Now the two will stop at nothing to find that cat and bring him home. This is actually a very funny and smart comedy. The premise is absolutely ridiculous but the fact that everyone plays it straight really makes it work. I have never seen their comedy series but after watching this I think I might. All that said, this is not an amazing movie, and not worth theater prices but I did laugh quite a bit throughout. The humor is over-the-top, dry, intelligent and stupid and it all works. This is a great comedy to rent, don't think I'd buy it though.
