5535899,4,B00AZNEVNE,"""De Rouille et D'os"" (English title: ""Rust and Bone""; 115 min.) is a 2012 French-Belgian co-production that was first released at the 2012 Cannes film festival. The movie is directed by Jacques Audiar, the guy who brought us the excellent ""The Prophet"" movie a few years ago. The movie stars Belgian actor Matthias Schoenarts as Ali, who along with his 5 yr. old son, and down on his luck, is moving in with his sister and her husband in Antibes (Southern France). Ali is the muscular type, and he finds a job as a bouncer in a local night club, where he eventually meets Stephanie (played by Marion Cotillard). Stephanie works as a killer whale trainer at the local waterpark. Stephanie is, like Ali, a strong-willed person and their relationship is not an easy one. Then one day Stephanie gets involved in a horrible accident at work, losing both her legs. To say that this throws her world upside down would be the understatement of the year. It also has immediate consequences on her relationship with Ali. At this point we're not even half-way through the movie, and to give more away about the plot would really ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Let me tell you, this is one heck of a movie. Not always easy viewing, but it kept my attention fromn start to finish. Schoenarts, after his leading role in last year's Oscar-nominated ""Bull's Head"", confirms with this commanding, physical, and at times startling, performance that he is one of the most promising up-and-coming actors, and I am quite certain it won't be much longer before Hollywood comes knocking on his door. The performance of Marion Cotillard (who won a Best Actress Oscar a few years ago for her portrayal of Edith Piaf) has equally been gathering major buzz, although I found the CGI a bit off-putting. But nobody can contest that these two play out a challenging relationship on screen in a very believable and engaging (if sometimes nerve-wrecking) manner. I found myself at times almost shocked, but then also very moved, as the relationshiop between Ali and Stephanie plays out.

This movie was a box-office smash in several European markets (it was playing in its 15th week in Belgium when I saw it there in late August). This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood action fare, or relationship fare for that matter. But if you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Rust and Bone"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1354665600,70,2492,4.73963133640553

Here comes my don't judge a book/movie by its cover speech. Speech to myself, I mean, because actually I often feel I can tell a lot by a cover! So, must rethink that.
I watched this movie because another storyteller/director referenced Jacques Audiard's work. So glad I read that interview. This is a break the mold, risk-taking movie with an outstanding performance by Marion Cotillard. Matthias Schoenarts, too, and the rest of the cast.

5535949,1,B00AZNEVNE,"This movie was godawful. It honestly makes me wonder if so much of the hype was all paid in some way, because I can see no other explanation for anyone actually raving about this movie. It was that bad. After watching the trailer, I went in expecting a sweet love story. Turns out that trailer was fake news, because instead, I got two full hours of a guy manwhoring, abusing his child, and emotionally abusing an amputee. There was no love story here. None. The man was emotionless and cold as hell toward everyone the entire time and experienced no revelation or change. The ending was inconclusive. It gave no justification for the man being such an ass, no reason for us to give one crap about him or, in turn, this movie. Just horrible, and honestly kind of awkward throughout (i.e., that lake scene...?). Don't waste your time.",1499990400,4,833,4.597315436241611

5535972,5,B00AZNEVNE,"Only a highly-skilled director-auteur could have told this emotionally-charged story in an entertaining fashion.

And that's what director Jacques Audiard did with Rust and Bone, starring one of France's most popular actress Marion Cotillard.

This story starts out when Stephanie, played by Cotillard, is working at a sea world show by feeding the Orca, killer whales. Out of the clear blue, all hell breaks loose. The platform she is standing on to feed the Orca collapses and she is crippled for life. At the hospital, she is given two prosthetic limbs to walk. Her life changes.

Along comes Ali, played by Matthias Schoenaerts, who she had met at a nightclub when she had two strong legs and loved dancing. Having given him her phone number, he finally calls her. They met. He had seen her accident on the news, so he isn't completely surprised by her artificial legs. He also had his own problems. He had left his girlfriend, and took his five-year-old son Sam, played by Armand Verdure, to move in with his sister, Anna, played by Corinne Masiero, in Antibes, in the south of France.

The thing is, however, Ali, has trouble finding a steady job. He no longer works as a security bouncer at the nightclub where he met Stephanie. Now he works as a part-time installer of surveillance cameras. Having to take care of his son, and maintaining a relationship with Stephanie has placed undue burdens on Ali. To make some more money to help his sister and his son, he takes on kickboxing matches for the money. He gets hurt, but at least, the kickboxing gig pays the bills.

This story, however, focuses more on Stephanie's legs than it does on Ali's financial woes. As a loving boyfriend, he takes her to the beach where she enjoys swimming. To get her to the water, he has to carry her. Once in the water, Stephanie feels at home again, and swims, swims, and swims. As Ali looks at her go, swimming without legs.

Kudos goes to the director of this excellent movie, Audiard. To put together a movie of such a story can't be easy. But he did it. The movie works. Plus it's entertaining, despite of the misery, shattered dreams, and the impoverished down and out players. Audiard paces the movie brilliantly. He tells the story through his own interpretation. It's the movie director as auteur in the same vein as Francois Truffaut, Jean Renoir, and Luis Brunel.

And just when one thinks things could get worse for the characters. Things get worse. Ali's sister is caught by the surveillance cameras, installed by Ali, stealing expired food. As a result, she gets fired. Upset she blames her brother, who moves up north to Strabourg where his son ends up in the hospital after a tragic accident on the ice.

This emotionally charged story, Rust and Bone, comes at the viewer at different angles. Yet it's an entertaining movie, one of the reasons is the brilliant acting by Cotillard, and her co-star Matthias Schoenaerts. Sure, director Jacques Audiard deserves credit for telling such a sad story in a watchable entertaining fashion. Yet one of the secrets of his accomplishment to make quite a brilliant movie was the actress and actor he used to tell about the down and out misfortunate survivalists in an unpredictable, unsteady, topsy-turvy world.  This movie is a brutal, hard-core squeeze on one's idea of humanity and the struggle of daily living. Clearly opposite of the feel good comedies. Rust and Bone is more about feel good I'm a human and I care. As far as the language, this movie is entirely in French. Yet it's simply enough for an intermediate French student to understand.

Yet Audiard lets the images, not words, tell the story. And he does so masterfully like a genuine cinema auteur.",1494892800,4,3709,4.7632398753894085

5535979,5,B00AZNEVNE,"An always interesting, sometimes absorbing, film. Cotillard's acting is (characteristically) superb, and her emotional connection with the audience contrasts brilliantly with the alienation that various scenes call for. One would think that the matching of these two characters would lack credibility, but both Cotillard and Schoenaerts are both fascinating and convincing. As an American who tires of the overly polished and predictable work of Hollywood blockbusters, I think this film will fill the need felt by ""foreign film"" aficionados.",1483574400,2,542,5.8734177215189876

I know the director well from his other movies and all of his movis are very unique and well made. He has his true color and it is always so pleasant seeing his new movies.
My personal best is <READ MY LIPS> but all of his other movies like <The Beat that my Heat Skipped> or <A Self Made Hero> are all so great.
The only movie that I don't love that much was <A ProPhet> because of it's documentary like feeling.
This movie is about a woman Marion Cotillard who is working as a Whale trainer. But one day she had an accident and she had to cut her both legs. Before that, she meets this man who is having a humble life with his son and his sister. His work is humble but he fights as a amatur kickboxer from time to time.
When both met at a bar, the man (Matthias Schoenaerts) had a small injury in his hand because Marion had a small quarrel with another man and he wanted to help her and end up with a small fight. She brought him to her house and took care of him. At that time Marion had a boyfriend and the boyfriend didn't liked her bringing that man at home.

A few days later she had that terrible accident. Then she thought about Matthias Schoenaerts and called him.
He helped her from time to time as a friend. I think from the very beginning he got an eye on her.
One day he suggested her that she might have lost the desire of sex and she should try sex just to make sure it is still working.
He make time to have sex with her.
From then on, they have sex together from time to time. They become a sex buddy.
But not only that. Whenever Matthias Schoenaerts have a fighting schedule she goes there and watch it too.
One day when his manager is busy, she becomes the manager. She had this arrificial legs and stuff so she can walk by then.

Slowly she asks for what the relationship it about when Matthias Schoenaerts goes out with another girl in front of Marion when they all celebrate at a bar when he won the fight. He just said we are sex buddies.

Then one day Matthias' son had an accident. He fell into the thin iced water and just closed to death. The father Matthias was really afraid and paniced. At that time he thought about Marion and called her and said I LOVE YOU.

The story is not that complicated just like his other movies but
1. It is a unique way of acieving love.
2. So real exposing the cutten two legs -I think it is CGI showing the cutten leg part.
3. It is absoutley so sensual not even showing the whole sex shots.

It is a truely well made movie you should check it out.
This is not a rare movie to access.",1460937600,2,2717,4.052141527001862

They both were at their respective rock bottoms and due to her strength (she made the call lol) they fought their way back.

If you saw it, you'd be hard pressed to understand how such a tough-as-nails guy succeeded in making such a sensitive portrait of a woman. Turns out, it had to have been all Cotillard. It became apparent to me watching this interview that for the co-authors of this script, this film is nothing but a dweby attempt to give the kids who ignored/bullied them in junior high--re ""arrogant princess"" and ""bigger, stronger, ladie's man"" their comeuppance. Once I realized that they were just settling old scores by torturing these characters, I lost all interest in the movie. ""Remember Stephanie, who wouldn't give you the time of day in 9th grade? What if we gave her a horrible accident."" And imagine Jacques, that big bully, and how successful his life must be today: a terrible father, I'm sure."" Ughh.",1451520000,,1002,4.970238095238095

Jaques Audiard guides the story in a true to life way that does not allow it to become some frivolous love story meant to entertain, but a beautifully pieced together study of human triumph through adversity. The characters are flawed but you understand them, and together they provide the acceptance and support the other didn't even know they needed, which becomes the heart of the story. Don't watch this wanting Hollywood entertainment and romance because you won't get it. It is raw and sometimes hard to watch, but is also beautifully subtle and real.

5536194,5,B00AZNEVNE,"this is the story of two people who grow: a woman who overcomes a physical disability and a man who overcomes his fear of intimacy, both transformed through an offbeat but very believable intimacy.

the principals are fabulous in their roles. they have a wonderfully fluid and understated chemistry that communicates affection and pain through minimal but unmistakable signals. cotillard's role is the most direct and her predicament the most visible and easily understood; schoenaerts manages to convey a character seeking to master his impulses and integrate the conflicts and challenges he faces as a man, a parent, a brother, a career boxer, and a lover.

my definition of art is that it brings you into a world without disorientation and presents that world without justification. in that sense, this is a wonderful work of art. i liked especially the implicit parallels between the young woman, employed at a marine park, and the young man, pursuing his brutal career as a boxer, as two different kinds of performing animals, not unlike the orcas or the dog breeder's stock. it's an ironic accent to the lower class life they lead with cote d'azur palatial hotels and luxury cruise ships always in the background and forever out of reach. but despite all that, their humanity and instinct for love triumphs. it's a portrait of human dignity as something independent of context and power -- as a work of art.",1437609600,,1413,4.957805907172996

5536243,5,B00AZNEVNE,"Rust and Bone a.k.a De rouille et d'os in French is a French-Belgian romantic drama film that tells the story of an unemployed 25- year-old man who falls in love with a disabled killer whale trainer.

The story starts out with an improbable tragedy. Orca whale trainer Stphanie has an accident at a tawdry seaside aquarium that leads to the double amputation of her legs. Ali arrives at his sister's house in the same ramshackle Mediterranean town of Antibes with his 5-year-old son in tow. Ali's broke, aimless, ill-equipped to tend to son Sam. Stphanie and Ali first meet before the accident at a nightclub where he has taken a job as a bouncer. She has a boyfriend. He is tough, bruising, confident in his skin and in the sack. He gives her his number. After her trauma, Stphanie calls and they enter into a relationship.

Whatever digital trickery is used to strip Cotillard of her legs, it's so beautifully and simply done that we soon stop thinking of her amputee status as a special effect and accept it as a simple physical truth. When things do get sexual between Ali and Stphanie, their love scenes together are frequent, naked, graphic, and sizzling hot. It's easy to believe that these two very different peoplean educated animal trainer and a barely verbal meathead  share a powerful connection at the level of their bodies, a bond that they need more than they understand it.

Not every viewer will be seduced by Rust and Bone's style, which might be classified as romantic naturalism. There's plenty of roving, intimate hand-held camera in the style of the Dardenne brothers but the movie's tone couldn't be farther from Dardennes' emotional austerity. Audiard is partial to long poetic montages of light on water, copious lens flares, and the pull-out-the-stops manipulative power of American pop music. A short scene of Stphanie rocking out alone in her wheelchair to the sound of the B-52s' ""Love Shack"" tells us everything we need to know about the mojo she's slowly recovering. And a later scene, in which Stphanie returns alone to Marineland to re-encounter the orcas who deprived her of her legs, must surely represent the most exhilarating narrative use to which Katy Perry's ""Firework"" has ever been put.

Looking back at the movie,you may feel surprise, even shame, that you managed to care so much about this none-too-original story of two damaged people whose unexpected connection helps them each find their way out of a bad place in their lives. But it is a movie about letting go of shame and making way for the advent of pleasure.",1416614400,,2561,4.837899543378995
5536244,5,B00AZNEVNE,"I'm almost not sure what to say about this film. I watched it when it was released and for a long time I couldn't stop thinking about it, yet I couldn't talk about it. It pretty much ripped me apart and then put me back together again.

Marion Cotillard is Stephanie, an Orca trainer who loses her legs and pretty much her desire to be a part of the world. She's strong and no matter where she is in her journey during the film, the viewer somehow knows that she's got an iron will under the despair and disappointment with the turn her life has taken. I don't think I've ever seen Cotillard in anything else, so this was my first time and she really blew me away. Talent. Pure talent.

And then we have Ali, played by Matthias Schoenaerts. I had never seen or heard of Schoenaerts and while Cotillard is the one most people talk about, Schoenarts is the actor whose performance stuck with me. Why? Mostly because he lost himself so fully in the character that he was just pure grit and bloody knuckles. Also, because Ali is this fighter and I never knew where he was going to end up, whether he would make the right choices, how he would decide to live his life. I knew where I wanted Ali to end up but I had no idea if I was going to get that ending. That is somethiing special when it comes to a film, especially a film focused on personal relationships and growth.

I liked Cotillard but when Rust and Bone ended I went looking for anything Schoenaerts had acted in.

Lastly, these two actors could not have been better matched. The relationship between Stephanie and Ali was electric, and sad, and hopeful, and tender, and harsh...so very harsh at times. You got the feeling though that whether the relationship became toxic or beautiful, Stephanie and Ali couldn't quit each other, and so, I couldn't take my eyes off them.

This film is something special. One of the best relationship films I've ever seen.",1415577600,,1913,4.438746438746438

5536261,5,B00AZNEVNE,"Rust and Bone is a story about two unlikely characters who come together due to unforeseen circumstances. These characters are lost- due to tragedy and life events but they forge a bond and find love and care.
Rust and Bone is about people struggling with odds and events that are beyond the scope of imagination.
An extraordinary film about ordinary people displaying many weaknesses but also extraordinary strength.
 Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) moves to the seaside town of Antibes with son in tow. Although we never see the mother it is suggested that she is a loser. Ali as the father is not responsible either and often neglects his son. In fact all Ali cares for is himself.  He meets Stephanie, a orca whale trainer and some months later is in a horrific accident at work, losing her legs. Ali sort of help her with rehabilitation, showing rare moments of love. They don't really fall in love in the normal sense however each helps each other. An anchor less emotionally bankrupt man with a woman who is physically dependent. He does not pity her but treats her like a normal person.
Schoenaerts is just superb as a emotionally cold man who uses his brawn for money and Cotillard makes the movie awesome- we start to see the world from the eyes of an amputee.

However the acting is not the only thing that is awesome. The mood created by the director is of superior craftsmanship. The scene with Cotillard  at the Marine Park and the song Fireworks by Katy Perry,gives us goosebumps as you start to realise that something  terrible is about to happen.  Another scene of amazement is with Cotillard with the orca after she return to visit when she has lost her legs. Finally there is the scene when Ali takes a restroom break in nature while his son is playing alone. The director finds amazing ways to build tension out of ordinary moments.
The movie is based on the short stories ""Rust and Bone"" and ""Rocket Ride"" from the book ""Rust and Bone"" by Canadian author Craig Davidson.

5536278,5,B00AZNEVNE,"'What have you done with my legs?' The Implacable Forces of Nature
Warning: May Contain Spoilers

Films that linger in that disrupted corner of the psyche are rare and writer/director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, Read My Lips) has that rare ability to create a strange but believable encounter and develop that into a relationship so unique and yet so seemingly mundane that he jars his audience, leaving them with a more acute vision of our needs as human beings. RUST AND BONE is based on a strange story by Craig Davidson and Audiard along with Thomas Bidegain transformed this touching love tale into an unusually moving and beautiful film.

Ali (the strikingly handsome and talented Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts) in his mid 20's, an unemployed father to a young son, Sam (Armand Verdure) travels on a metro gathering scraps of discarded food for sustenance and arrives in Antibes, southern France to look for work. The father son duo crash with Ali's sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) who already has her own share of problems with money and temporary employment. Ali gets a job as a bouncer in a night club but maintains his passion for kick boxing. One evening in the nightclub where he works, Ali meets St&eacute;phanie (Marion Cotillard) and escorts her safely to her home after she is injured in a brawl at the club. St&eacute;phanie works at a marine tourist park training Orca whale's where she suffers a tragic accident during a show and wakes up in the hospital to realize that her legs have been amputated. Ali meets a guy at work who informs him about a kick boxing game where he can make money and enjoy his sport. St&eacute;phanie, now in a wheelchair, is terminally depressed and gives Ali a call. Ali visits her and takes her to a beach where they swim. Over a period of time, Ali and St&eacute;phanie spend a lot of time together and get involved in casual sex `on call', while Ali hooks up with other women as well, being honest about it with St&eacute;phanie. St&eacute;phanie starts to accompany Ali to the kick boxing matches and a symbiosis forms between both of them. St&eacute;phanie regains self esteem in Ali's company and gets artificial limbs. She starts to walk again and even manages Ali's bets for kick boxing. Ali, St&eacute;phanie and some friends visit the same night club where Ali used to work. Ali goes to the dance floor and flirts with a girl as St&eacute;phanie watches curiously. Ali goes away with the girl leaving a dejected St&eacute;phanie with other friends. Anna is fired from her job as the higher management comes to know of her taking home the expired food products. Anna blames Ali for this as Ali was involved in an odd job where he installed spy cameras in work areas at the direction of the management to spy on the activities of their employees. This results in a standoff between Ali and Anna's partner and Ali leaves. Sam stays with Anna while Ali goes to a training facility for kick boxers in a distant place and loses touch with St&eacute;phanie. Sam visits Ali at his facility for a day and both are shown playing on a frozen lake. A weak spot on the frozen lake cracks and Sam falls into the lake, loses consciousness and floats on. Once Ali realizes Sam is missing and spots him under the frozen lake, Ali breaks his hands with his beating the ice to free the unconscious Sam. Sam survives and in the hospital Ali breaks down while talking to St&eacute;phanie on the phone and confesses his love for her after realizing that he had been cold and insensitive to her all this time. As the film closes, Ali is shown to have gone professional in kick-boxing as Sam and Stephanie stand by him in what looks like a post-fight victory ceremony.

The film is enhanced by Alexandre Desplat's sensitive musical score and the cinematography, especially in the fight scenes, by St&eacute;phane Fontaine is exemplary. But it is the powerful performances by Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts that bring this impossibly fragile film to a new height of cinematic brilliance. This is a film to see repeatedly and to purchase for your personal library of exceptional films. Grady Harp, April 14",1396915200,,4184,4.776243093922652

That, however, is precisely what Jacques Audiard has done with Rust and Bone, a moving and raw look at how two rather ordinary people respond to extraordinary circumstances. Stephanie, a whale trainer played by the brilliant Marion Cotillard, must face life as a double amputee after a freak accident. Alainplayed by the painfully handsome Matthias Schoenaertsis a single father who must juggle his need to support his son while eking out a living for himself as a security guard. Stephanies and Alains lives intersect in unexpected but perfectly plausible ways, and their story generates equal parts despair and inspiration.

5536311,4,B00AZNEVNE,"SPOILER ALERT: In A-to-Z terms, RUST AND BONE (2012) is a happy-ending love story that brings together Stephanie, a woman who works at a ""Sea World"" type place on the coast of southern France and has both her legs chewed off by an orca, and Ali, a boxer/security guard who helps her heal emotionally and brings her back to loving life.

In my judgment, this film is very good in many scenes, some sweet, some amusing (especially those with Marion Cotillard, the 2007 Oscar winner who plays Stephanie, the injured woman), but this film unfortunately is very hokey and lame in many other scenes, including the last 25 minutes where a series of plot incidents is rather clumsily constructed to show Ali (played by Matthias Schoenaerts) leaving, disgraced and alienated from his family, going off to make his fortune anew, and heroically receiving terrible injuries himself while saving a life ... before being reunited with Stephanie.

Technically speaking, the CGI scenes showing Stephanie's amputated legs and prosthetic legs are world-class. (BTW my late father had a prosthetic leg, so I know a bit about these things.)

Weighing this movie's strengths and weaknesses, if I were giving it a letter grade, it would be a ""B-"".

As an attractive, successful, and strong-willed woman who has suddenly lost her legs through a tragic accident, Stephanie is drawn to Ali.

5536317,4,B00AZNEVNE,"""Rust and Bone"" stars Marion Cotillard (Stephanie) and Matthias Schoenaerts (Ali) as an unlikely couple.  Ali is a young single father who is barely scraping by; he lives with his sister and her boyfriend and works odd jobs.  Stephanie is a killer whale trainer at one of those seaworld type parks in Southern France.  They meet when Ali is working as a bouncer at a bar which Stephanie frequents.  She gets into an altercation, and Ali more or less comes to her rescue, although he also insults her.  They don't see each other again until something goes very wrong in Stephanie's life, and she turns to the brutish Ali for comfort...or something.

What makes ""Rust and Bone"" interesting is the murky relationship between the two leads.  The plot is over-stuffed with drama, but fortunately the two stars are under-stated enough in their performances that the movie doesn't devolve into melodrama.  The movie ends up being believable despite certain rather unbelievable plot twists.  Cotillard and Shoenaerts are really quite spectacular; she manages to express her pain and discomfort without having endless crying scenes, and Schoenaerts effortlessly manages to be brutish, sexy, and likeable (sorta).  Cotillard deservedly received numerous award nominations (Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, Cesar, BAFTA); Schoenaerts did not receive as much attention, although he did win Most Promising Actor at the Cesars.

Director Jacques Audiard frankly has done better work: Read My Lips, The Prophet, The Beat That My Heart Skipped.  However, he always puts together a good team.  The cinematography by Stphane Fontaine is top-notch, especially all of the outdoor and water scenes.  The score by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous; I'm also always impressed by his ability to pick existing songs that perfectly accompany scenes.  Here, he uses musicians as diverse as Katy Perry, Bruce Springsteen, and Lukke Li to beautiful effect.

5536330,3,B00AZNEVNE,"What is happening to French cinema? In the last five years there have been very few outstanding films, with a predominance of cutesy escapism or gritty, tough thrillers. Rust and Bone is one of those films that wants to be seen as having integrity and seriousness but is actually quite commercial and lacking in depth both in the script and visual style. It relies very heavily on violence to create what the Daily Telegraph (London) describes as 'genuine power', but if you take out these events from both the lives shown, plus the further calamity that occurs, which is also violent in a sense, you would be left with an insipid drama about two people in their everyday lives shown fairly superficially.

No one seems to have an inner life at all, which is particularly unsatisfactory when someone goes through something as disastrous as Marion Cotillard's character (Stephanie) does.  There is a passing attempt to show her despair, but it is so brief it hardly registers. You cannot really make an entertainment based on this kind of subject, but this film attempts to do so. It shows us beautiful actors, flattering us that we're being very compassionate and that their looks are incidental, and suggesting that Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) is actually a very decent character under the surface, completely lacking in the bourgeois notion of fidelity, whose sexual openness allows Stephanie to unlock this side of her nature again. This is the extent, really, of its insight into 'blue collar' mores - it's hardly A Woman Under the Influence.

Furthermore, the characters are not really all that likeable beyond the trait of Ali's I've mentioned - plus one nice scene on the beach where he is quite considerate - and her warmth towards his son and need for something more than quick-fix sex. Why does Ali get involved in the very sordid underground fighting scene? And how can Stephanie bear to watch him getting beaten up with hardly a flinch and even take over the organising of events? It's the kind of setup that might just about work in a genre vehicle like Steve Austin's Damage, but it's hardly adequate in a supposedly serious film. Then there's his security job which also turns out to be completely immoral ... and used for a very unconvincing plot coincidence.

But to show the rather artificially souped-up emotions of the film, one scene is particularly revealing. They are in a nightclub and Ali has insensitively gone off to spend the night with another woman, not sparing a thought for Stephanie's feelings. So she is upset, understandably. At this point she is chatted up by a stranger. She has a highly alluring and revealing top on but has covered the fact she is disabled. She orders champagne, then is about to leave on her own, at which point the man notices her serious disability. In real life he would have had no need to say anything, and would have covered his surprise. I think even the crudest person would do this. But here, the realisation signals ludicrous apologies, with him saying 'I'm sorry, I had no idea', her acting incredulously, and his repeating it, really spelling it out. The purpose of the exchange is so she can get angry and smash a champagne glass in his face, causing bleeding.

There is a political point being made here, clearly, but the means seems very crude. It is unconvincing on his part, and not sympathetic on hers, as she would surely have to realise that her condition would give people a jolt of surprise, especially in a pick-up situation where she is wearing a low-cut top. The emphasis of the film is too much on these kind of events ... hence my feeling that the whole exercise is a bit superficial and determined to keep sex and violence in the centre of the frame, even though in real life they generally aren't. Having said this, I loved the recent 'The Sessions', but there the actors seemed far less like stereotypes of the attractive young man and woman - neither fitted the category - and the film had real heart. I think in Audiard's film it is the cocktail of sex and violence that is the key, and the way it taps into contemporary brutalised attitudes unquestioningly - and a bit exploitatively - that jars somewhat. It's not so different from Steve McQueen's Shame, and if it is better than that film, it still doesn't deserve the high praise it's received, I don't think.",1373068800,3,4351,4.742404227212682
5536331,4,B00AZNEVNE,"This was one of those films that didn't play at the local multiplex and I was too busy to make a 35 mile journey to take it in.  So here it is on Blu ray and it is excellent both in terms of the movie and the transfer to disc.  First the movie.

The film was directed and co-written (with Thomas Bidegain) by Jacques Audiard, perhaps best known for his Oscar nominated foreign language film, ""A Prophet (Un prophete)"" from 2009.  ""Rust and Bone (De rouille et d'os)"" was expected to garner some Oscar nods as well, especially for former winner Marion Cotillard who plays Stephanie, a seemingly lonely party girl at night and a trainer of Orcas during the day.

The other key player in this story is Alain (Ali) van Versch (Matthias Schoenaerts), a Belgian living in France with his 5 year old son, Sam (Armand Verdure).  Ali is broke and separated from Sam's mom.  He moves in with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) who is a clerk at a large discount store and her truck driver husband.  Alain gets a job as a bouncer at a night club frequented by Stephanie and rescues her when her flirtations don't go far enough for a local guy on the make.

Later during a show at the water park, one of the killer whales goes awry and takes out Stephanie.  When she awakens in the hospital, both her legs have been amputated at the knee.  Now before I'm jumped for spoilers, this theme has been well publicized in trailers and even portrayed in some cover art.  Surprisingly the terrible accident isn't gruesomely displayed on screen.  Stephanie goes into deep depression.  She evidently has no family outside her co-workers.

Meanwhile Alain has been earning money fighting in unsanctioned street tournaments.  In a previous life he fought as a boxer and a mixed-martial arts fighter.  It turns out he's pretty good.  One night Stephanie picks up the phone and calls Ali who does remember her.  They meet several times and in one nice scene they go to the beach.  Ali coaxes her into the water where she finally feels somewhat at home and normal.  Her shortened legs don't seem to hamper her abilities in the water.  At this point, the filmmakers could have easily taken the easy and predictable route, but the relationship remains chaste, even as Stephanie accompanies Ali to some of his fights.

Finally, Ali who considers sex just a physical act, asks Stephanie if she wants to....well, you know just to see if everything still works.  Again, this could have been cheapened but somehow even with no lower legs and no make-up and stringy hair, Stephanie is still sexy as hell.  That might seem weird saying it, but I think that is the point that the filmmakers and story creator Craig Davidson had in mind.  Cotillard is brilliant as Stephanie and the chemistry between her and Schoenaerts is authentic.  I do think the ending is a bit muddled and overdone.  But this is certainly one of the better films from 2012.

The Blu ray disc is as good as the film.  It comes in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The color is really noteworthy.  There are numerous shots of the ocean and even the Orca's water tank that are sharp and realistic.  The skin tones are excellent.  The transfer has a film-like texture even though it is shot on video.  This is an excellent video presentation.  The audio, likewise is demo worthy.  It comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is great.  The audio here ranges from very quiet moment of Stephanie alone with her thoughts to loud crowd noises at the Orca show.  Others are more subtle, such as traffic and club scenes.  Another outstanding element to this film is an excellent soundtrack.  It features a relatively obscure Bruce Springsteen song called State Trooper remixed by TrentMoller.  It's a killer track.",1372723200,,3746,4.639269406392694

The director of this film made ""A Prophet"", a gritty prison film a few years ago.
To start with Marion Cotillard seemed to be too mature to be believable as a whale trainer in an amusement park.
Secondly no details had been revealed on how her injuries were sustained therefore you just accept it as a dramatic curve.
The jobless father took her under his wings until she recovered, both physically and mentally while you don't feel a hint of sentiment or love.
Although the father had a damaged hand, he got involved in bare knuckled illegal fights to earn money.
How could this be possible(the fighting sequences were poorly choreographed)with an injured right hand?
Halfway through watching the film, I told myself there could be 3 outcomes for a film of this type:
1.  A tragic ending.
2.  A happy ending.
3.  A nothing happens ending.
You may select one of the endings from above.
None really matters.
The whole story simply defy believability therefore you don't feel anything for the couple's predicaments and mutual attraction.
A failed and too self-important drama from France.",1369353600,5,1452,4.7047244094488185
5536363,5,B00AZNEVNE,"Two films spoke to me in 2012: Cloud Atlas, an epic and inspirational film, and Rust and Bone, an intimate and uplifting film. Both are expertly shot, wonderfully acted and instant classics.

Rust and Bone is a foreign film, so its also the best foreign film of 2012 and should have won more awards, though it was nominated. Quite simply, this film stunned me. It is truly beautiful.

If I had to pick which one I love more, between Cloud Atlas and Rust and Bone, I might actually choose Rust and Bone.

Being a fan of both Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, I was blown away at their acting on display here. The film allows both actors to reach career-defining heights, especially Marion Cotillard who is already such a good actress. Their performances are breathtaking to behold, and it will be difficult for both of them to out-do their work here.

The personal journeys that both characters embark on are equally touching and difficult to watch. Life takes these two people and literally shakes them up, drops them, then stands back to watch how they'll handle it or IF they can even recover.

Then the film takes a beautiful turn as both shaken characters find recovery in each other. They're relationship transcends romance, becoming something even deeper.

And when that relationship is tested, the end result is truly something to behold...proving ""romance movies"" can be realistic without giving into cliche. Although Rust and Bone is more than a ""romance movie"", and its sure as hell not a ""chick flick"".

Each character has at least one scene in the film where they triumphantly fight back against life's hardships. It is in these moments that Rust and Bone shines brightest.

Rust and Bone is true cinema. It is so well-done that I personally place the film in my Top 25 Films of All Time (high praise indeed). The film gets 5 out of 5 stars.

The blu-ray has perfect video and audio. In terms of quality true to the source material, Video and Audio both receive 5 out of 5 stars.

The extras are great too, with an Audio Commentary track and some lengthy Making-of videos, along with some Deleted Scenes. Extras get 4.5/5 stars.

Overall: 5/5 stars. Rust and Bone, along with Cloud Atlas, is the best film of 2012, the best foreign film of 2012, and one of the greatest films of all time, truly. It has been graced with a perfect blu-ray release. See it. Own it!

Rating: Rated R. There is some language, though its in French (the entire film is in French with English subtitles) and minor drinking in a club-like setting. Violence tends to be bloody in a few fight scenes, and sexual material is raw in some scenes and beautiful in others. The emotional intensity of the story can be gut-wrenching, so be prepared for it.

5536387,3,B00AZNEVNE,"A struggling single father helps a beautiful whale trainer recover her will to live following a terrible accident that leaves her confined to a wheelchair.  Though Stephanie's position on the high end of the social spectrum makes romance an unlikely prospect for the pair, a tragic accident at Marineland robs her of her legs, and finds her reaching out in desperation to Ali.

Marion Cotillard (Stephanie) gives a solid performance as a disabled Marineland trainer and is very believable in her role of despair and helplessness.

Matthias Schoenaerts (as Ali) also gives a good performance as the guy who is more emotionally disabled from his life experiences.  I really wanted to give Ali the benefit of the doubt in the movie and had hope that he will reform his ways but at the conclusion of the movie, I disliked the character more than liked him even though the movie had the formulaic happy ending (almost unbelievably so).  The formulaic happy ending I felt detracted from the movie a bit and seemed a bit out of character from what you would have expected from Stephanie, which to me prevented this movie from being 5 stars.  Also I felt that the movie at times felt too long and drawn out (at 2 hours and 2 minutes) and scenes could have been cut down a bit so that the movie didn't feel too slow and not well paced.

RUST and BONE immediately drew me in with its arresting cinematography, immediate realism, and so on. The plot is an interesting mix of qualities: compelling but unfocused, surprising but often dissatisfying. As patchy as it is, this story takes you to some interesting places. Several reviewers have noted that we don't know enough about the characters to really empathize with them. I see what they mean, but I think this lack of information is intentional, and I'm not so sure that it would be better if we did know more--not because they're such terrible people, but because, you know, does it really matter in the end? The mere fact that reviewers--even those who give it only 1 or 2 stars--have found so much to analyze here and have interpreted RUST and BONE in so many different ways says something for the substance of this film.

Anyhoo, Ali and Stephanie are both quite real, and RUST and BONE is an interesting mass character study of people at their bests and worsts, who, though it's nothing dramatic, DO experience some change and transformation in discovering what's most important to them. Stepanie's injury and Ali's love coupled with abuse and neglect of his son are vital ingredients, done with sober conviction.

Those with a low tolerance for raw violence and/or melancholy should probably skip RUST and BONE. Otherwise, it's an interesting change of pace that stays with you for awhile.",1366416000,,1422,4.941422594142259
5536426,1,B00AZNEVNE,"* The main characters do no change or even develop.

Stephanie begins the film as a self-absorbed woman who loves to control dangerous creatures.  For a living, she trains performing killer whales.  For fun, she goes to clubs and dances until violent men force themselves upon her.  After losing her legs in an accident, she calls a bouncer who helped her one night.  He seemed dangerous too.  Turns out he is also a former kickboxer with a lot of bad habits.  As the movie progresses, she ""rediscovers"" who she was prior to losing her legs by spiraling down into a relationship with Alain that also includes managing his covert return to fighting.  In other words, aside from losing her legs, she doesn't change.

Alain (aka Ali) is a bum.  He has a kid he can't take care of and he has severe emotional issues which are not explained.  He has opportunistic, violent sex with a number of women.  When he gets the chance to revive his fighting career, he gets excited.  He fights and wins.  He is even more aggressive.  He makes more bad decisions.  Near the end, he abandons everyone to go train as a fighter.  We are left to assume that this is a kind of redemptive act on his part.  However, he never really changes.  In fact, he continues to be a neglectful father to the point at which the child's life is placed in grave danger.  In other words, aside from returning to the ring, he does not change.

* Whenever the movie gets slow, something bad happens to the kid.

As I allude to above, there are several points in the story where something bad happens to Ali's son, and each time it is a result of Ali's neglect.  Near the end, the child almost dies.  However, when the movie ends, everything appears to be happy and fine.  This is a horrible cheap trick and in the end the characters really haven't resolved this pattern of abuse.  We have no idea if it is ongoing or not or if it will return should Ali's sudden good fortune in the ring fall flat.

Holding a child hostage is a poor substitute for conflict.

* So why do people like this film?

I suppose people like Rust and Bone because it has an edge.  There are ugly bits of human nature revealed in the story.  There are gritty depictions of sex.  There is shocking abuse of both women and children.  All of this will set your nerves on edge, and I suppose that some people mistake the edginess they feel for some sort of artistic connection.  Honestly, I can't understand it.

All in all, Rust and Bone is a weak portrait of shallow people that relies on cheap tricks to keep the audience engaged.",1366243200,17,2565,4.419700214132762

5536428,4,B00AZNEVNE,"Some movie are fleeting, fun, enjoyable, and don't last, not many haunts you for good or bad reasons. This one infected me in a deep melancholy way for days. Not because of the subject matter but because the actors' acting was so superb; only a few movies reached this level of absorption for me. I felt every word and emotions that went through the actors--in fact, I wouldn't call what they did on the screen acting--it was so good that it felt real. That's what great acting is, when it becomes so real that it's driven deep inside the viewer's emotional reality.

Without giving too much away and not wanting to repeat the movie's synopsis this is what I enjoyed about the movie: The movie don't tell you much about the characters' background or history, but there's enough to know that neither were happy people: one created the circumstances in his life, the other had the misfortune of fate imposed upon her, and how they both helped each other move on, not with deliberate planning or conscious determination, but by the beauty of their natural being and difference in their innate characters. I saw the generosity of simple love and care in a honest helping hand. The movie ends well. It is a deep movie with moments of too real violent street fighting scenes and sex scenes that are not suitable for immature people. Though my life is different from the characters, I am left thinking and wondering about the ""what if"" factor. To me that's when a movie is a good movie, when it makes you think. I honestly believe no other actors or director could have made this movie what it is. [There was only one fleeting moment of a scene that spoiled everything that caused this review its one star of the five stars. It's a scene on the beach. I'm not going to say anything, but I like to know if anyone else noticed it.

Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts star in ""Rust And Bone"" (""De rouille et d'os""), Jacques Audiard's follow-up as director to Oscar-nominated ""A Prophet."" Not surprisingly Cotillard is first-billed, even though Schoenaerts's character plays a bigger role in the story. To be more precise, it seems as if two stories are vying for our attention in ""Rust and Bone,"" neither achieving its full potential.

""Rust and Bone"" is about two damaged souls: Stphanie, a killer whale trainer who has a terrible accident, and Alain, a kick boxer and single father of a five-year-old son Sam. The film is basically a romance, but their romance is told with the director's unflattering descriptions of raw emotions and desires, especially the sexual ones. Two talented actors (with Marion Cotillard nominated for Golden Globe) give their all and they deserve all the praise heaped on them.

The film itself is flawed, however. The story doesn't convince, with Stphanie's character development that happens in too short a time. Matthias Schoenaerts's character, driven by basic instincts, is more intriguing and convincing, even though what he goes through is after all a pretty familiar process including some plot contrivances.

After all, ""Rust And Bone"" uses extreme examples of characters to attract our attention, while failing to provide any reason for us to identify with these characters, or care what these people would do. Strong acting from the leads almost makes up for that.",1365724800,,1509,5.279166666666667

5536447,5,B00AZNEVNE,"Anchored by two masterclass performances, `Rust + Bone' is certainly one of the best films of 2012.  I remember watching Audiard's 2009 Oscar nominee `A Prophet' and thinking that he had a brilliant career ahead of him, and seeing `Rust + Bone', which is arguably better, I think I made a good call there.  With such depth of breadth, Audiard floats us from one scene to the next in a beautifully calculated and effervescent look at human weakness and desperation, all the more enriched by the beauty and the triumph of the human spirit.  Equal parts gritty realism and heartfelt passions, `Rust + Bone' etches itself on our skin and creates a magnificent glimpse at the power of film today.

It moved me deeply.

The film follows the lives of two individuals who are confronted with adversity in one form or another and form a beautiful bond (that is fragmented and strained, but still beautiful) through the course of their newfound situation.  Alain, a former kick boxer is suddenly left in charge of his five year old son and moves in with his sister in order to give him a stable home.  He gets a few jobs here and there as a bouncer or a security guard (thanks to his girth) and then he meets the beautiful if not mysterious Stephanie, an Orca trainer at a sea life theme park who is in an unhappy relationship.  After a horrific accident leaves Stephanie paralyzed, she seeks out Alain for support.  His carefree approach to her plight (he doesn't coddle her or treat her different while still maintaining an air of kindness and respect for her) helps open Stephanie's eyes to the light at the end of her very dark tunnel.  But before happiness can be achieved, pain and suffering have to erode progression, and as Alain falls into street fighting to make some extra money and feed his hunger for excitement, his role as a father becomes secondary and his relationship with Stephanie becomes strained as his self-centered habits start to take over.

With such rich direction, `Rust + Bone' is harmoniously crafted and packs a punch unlike any other film I've seen this year.  It make me shake.  I was shaking.  It truly unearthed such honesty and such raw humanity that I'm in awe of the film, from start to finish.  The film's bookends are fantastic, the development of character was some of the best (if not THE BEST) I've seen this year, and the way it tackled such melodramatic themes with authenticity as opposed to unbridled theatrics was a blessing.

VIDEO:

""Rust and Bone"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks fantastic as the outdoor scenes are colorful and vibrant, close-ups are full of detail, skin tones look natural, black levels are nice and deep.  The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray and the visual effects and how they are able to make Marion Cotillard without any legs was fantastic.  I didn't notice any artifacts or aliasing, picture quality for the film is nicely saturated and looks fantastic on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Rust and Bone"" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film but while the film is primarily center and front-channel driven, there are moments where ambiance is used for the surround channels.  Primarily crowd ambiance or Katy Perry's ""Fireworks"" being played, for a film such as ""Rust and Bone"", the lossless soundtrack is very good and appropriate.  I didn't notice any problems with the audio during my viewing of the film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With each film that I have seen from director Jacques Audiard, what I love about the films is how fresh and different they are from Hollywood films.

From his last film ""Un prophete"" which I found to be amazing, his latest film ""Rust and Bone"" was a pleasant surprise.

From the trailer to the opening moments of the film, the first thing that was going in my mind was, ""oh great, another thug film with a beautiful woman falling for him"".  But also saying to myself that Audiard is not known for banality, he knows how to switch things up for the viewers and surprise them.

So, while the film does start off with a guy who looked as if he came from trouble and has a child joining him, the film is about a man who wants to get his son away from the trouble that the child's mother was involved in.  Ali is unemployed but he doesn't want his son to be drug runner at the age of five, so, he moves with the kid to stay with his sister Anne.

Anne is not in the best financial shape but she is at least caring for her brother and her nephew but also emphasizes to him that the boy is his responsibility.  We see how Ali tries to get a good job to help raise his child but he's not exactly a father figure.  He neglects his son as he puts job, his passion for kickboxing/fighting and having sex with women as more of a priority.

Meanwhile, we are introduced to a beautiful woman named Stephanie who is a whale trainer at the marine aquarium.  But after being chomped on by one of her whales that mistakes her legs as food, she now must move forward with her life with her disability.  But like any person who had legs one day and their whole life altered after losing them, we see Stephanie going through the motions of depression, isolation and not wanting to hear pity stores from family and friends, the only person she doesn't know that she wants to talk to is Ali.  The guy she met once at the club.

But Ali, turns out to be a cool guy by taking her out to the beach, to get out of her shell and try to enjoy life once again.  But most importantly, Ali is there to not pity her but treat her like a normal human being, even offering to have sex with her, to help her know if she still has desires and can still be a sexual woman.

The two develop this friendship built upon their boody call but it's when Ali lets her into his world of fighting and seeing how she supports him and how she accepts his son Sam and also his living conditions with no criticism, he eventually begins to war up to her.

But with dreams to be a fighter and a woman who wants more from their ""friendship"", is Ali ready to settle down?  And will he come through for the people he matters most, especially his son, Sam.

Part of the film's efficacy is the magnificent performance by Marion Cotillard.  I don't think I have seen one bad performance from the actress and in ""Rust and Bone"", she is fantastic!  From playing a woman that is happy, depressed, sad, angry and just a full spectrum of emotions that are displayed on screen, Jacques Audiard hit casting gold with Cotillard and it's this performance that made this film much more enjoyable.

The visual effects for the film was also fantastic and how they were able to capture Cotillard as a person without legs and make the film look so realistic was great.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Rust and Bone"" looks amazing on Blu-ray.  Colors are vibrant, especially the outdoor scenes. Closeups show plenty of detail and the visual effects were done to perfection and Cotillard looked as if she didn't have any legs.  Audio quality is primarily dialogue driven, with the Katy Perry ""Fireworks"" song and crowd ambiance used for the surround channels to be the most utilized segments of the film's lossless track.  But dialogue and music is crystal clear.

Overall, ""Rust and Bone"" is yet another unique, fresh and wonderful Jacques Audiard film.  An unpredictable, non-banal storyline in which Marion Cotillard absolutely shines in this film!  Highly recommended!",1364601600,6,6209,4.670967741935484

Once there he gets a job as a door guard at a night club, and one evening he comes to the aid of a lady in distress. That lady is Stephanie played brilliantly by Marion Cottillard (`Contagion' and `La vie en rose'). Stephanie is an Orca trainer or killer whale trainer as we used to call these beautiful creatures. She suffers an irreversible accident whilst at work and understandably falls off the radar and becomes a virtual recluse.

Then she calls up Alain and asks him to visit her as it was clear from the start that there was a spark. He duly obliges and a new relationship blossoms, however he needs some ready cash and turns to bare knuckle fist fights to make up the short fall.  What develops is a deeply engrossing and engaging tale of a journey towards each other for the two main players.

This is a film by Jacques' Audiard (`A Prophet' and `The Beat My Heart Skipped') and he took his inspiration from two short stories by Canadian author Craig Davison, `Rust and Bone' and `Rocket Ride'). He has made a wonderful film which has iconic shots subtle camera work and at its centre a fiercely strong performance from Cottillard that had me gripped from the very beginning. The shots of the whales are just amazing and whilst I don't agree with such beautiful animals being held in captivity, I understand their place in this story.

There is so much in this film that if you blink you will miss something. The music is great too everything from John Cooper Clark, the B 52's and Lykke Li. This is in French with really good sub titles.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Does 'Rust and Bone' excite you? Well, it does have a few good things about it. Principally there are those incredible special effects where they've managed to trick you into believing that Marion Cotillard who plays the protagonist's love interest, the whale-training Stphanie, is actually missing both her limbs in real life. The effects are so real that when Stphanie is injured at a local marine tourist park in an accident involving a whale she's been training, you begin to believe that her legs were superimposed through special effects, when we're introduced to the character, BEFORE the accident. Rest assured, however, it's the other way around. Ms. Cotillard indeed is fully mobile, walking about in real life, without prosthetics!

Of course the most interesting thing about the film is how the romance between the aspiring kick boxer Alain and the now depressed and bereft Stphanie, develops. Stphanie has lost her confidence as a woman due to the loss of her lower extremities but eventually begins having casual sex with Alain. She begins to spend more time with him, ending up managing his kick boxing bouts. The companionship leads Stphanie to acquire artificial limbs and she gradually pulls herself out of the worst part of her depressive funk.

Alain is much more problematic. He's set up as an unlikeable character so that he can have that big epiphany at film's end and redeem himself. But do you really want to go along for the ride and wait until Alain's big transformation? I don't fault him for most of his casual sex jaunts, especially because he's straight up about that with Stphanie. Of course, he does act quite crass when he walks off with a woman in front of Stphanie at the bar before their temporary separation. And what about all the kick boxing scenes? If you're not too interested in the sport (as I am), then you might not be too excited about Alain's quest to succeed in that particular sports arena.

Getting back to why and how the films' scenarists strive to paint Alain in such an unflattering light, again they need that set-up to turn him into a hero so we can identify with the character at film's end. Alain hits rock bottom when his sister Anna loses her job and she blames him for setting up a surveillance camera that reveals that she's been pilfering expired food products. As a result, Anna kicks her brother out of her house and he ends up traveling away at that distant kick boxing training facility. You'll notice that Alain's 'crime' in libertarian France, was to align himself with corporate management, and install those surveillance cameras that catch people like his sister, who are only making off with expired food products.

Now that tainted Alain must be redeemed, the 'Rust and Bone' scenarists resort to the old sleight of hand. Little Sam falls through the ice and despite the fact that he's in the water for any normal person to experience brain damage, Alain, utilizing those powerful kick boxing hands, cracks the ice and saves little Sam just in time to prevent him from turning into a vegetable.

Now the once disgraced working-class Judas, has saved his son and gets the girl back (that of course being Stphanie). I for one would have liked Alain's redemption to be a little more subtle. But hey, you can't have everything. Looking at Ms. Cottilard is good enough for me, even without those beautiful legs!",1363824000,4,3446,4.8108108108108105

Films that linger in that disrupted corner of the psyche are rare and writer/director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, Read My Lips) has that rare ability to create a strange but believable encounter and develop that into a relationship so unique and yet so seemingly mundane that he jars his audience, leaving them with a more acute vision of our needs as human beings. RUST AND BONE is based on a strange story by Craig Davidson  and Audiard along with Thomas Bidegain transformed this touching love tale into an unusually moving and beautiful film.

Ali (the strikingly handsome and talented Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts) in his mid 20's, an unemployed father to a young son, Sam (Armand Verdure) travels on a metro gathering scraps of discarded food for sustenance and arrives in Antibes, southern France to look for work. The father son duo crash with Ali's sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) who already has her own share of problems with money and temporary employment. Ali gets a job as a bouncer in a night club but maintains his passion for kick boxing. One evening in the nightclub where he works, Ali meets Stphanie (Marion Cotillard) and escorts her safely to her home after she is injured in a brawl at the club. Stphanie works at a marine tourist park training Orca whale's where she suffers a tragic accident during a show and wakes up in the hospital to realize that her legs have been amputated. Ali meets a guy at work who informs him about a kick boxing game where he can make money and enjoy his sport. Stphanie, now in a wheelchair, is terminally depressed and gives Ali a call. Ali visits her and takes her to a beach where they swim. Over a period of time, Ali and Stphanie spend a lot of time together and get involved in casual sex `on call', while Ali hooks up with other women as well, being honest about it with Stphanie. Stphanie starts to accompany Ali to the kick boxing matches and a symbiosis forms between both of them. Stphanie regains self esteem in Ali's company and gets artificial limbs. She starts to walk again and even manages Ali's bets for kick boxing. Ali, Stphanie and some friends visit the same night club where Ali used to work. Ali goes to the dance floor and flirts with a girl as Stphanie watches curiously. Ali goes away with the girl leaving a dejected Stphanie with other friends. Anna is fired from her job as the higher management comes to know of her taking home the expired food products. Anna blames Ali for this as Ali was involved in an odd job where he installed spy cameras in work areas at the direction of the management to spy on the activities of their employees. This results in a standoff between Ali and Anna's partner and Ali leaves. Sam stays with Anna while Ali goes to a training facility for kick boxers in a distant place and loses touch with Stphanie. Sam visits Ali at his facility for a day and both are shown playing on a frozen lake. A weak spot on the frozen lake cracks and Sam falls into the lake, loses consciousness and floats on. Once Ali realizes Sam is missing and spots him under the frozen lake, Ali breaks his hands with his beating the ice to free the unconscious Sam. Sam survives and in the hospital Ali breaks down while talking to Stphanie on the phone and confesses his love for her after realizing that he had been cold and insensitive to her all this time. As the film closes, Ali is shown to have gone professional in kick-boxing as Sam and Stephanie stand by him in what looks like a post-fight victory ceremony.

The film is enhanced by Alexandre Desplat's sensitive musical score and the cinematography, especially in the fight scenes, by Stphane Fontaine is exemplary. But it is the powerful performances by Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts that bring this impossibly fragile film to a new height of cinematic brilliance. This is a film to see repeatedly and to purchase for your personal library of exceptional films.  Grady Harp, March 13",1363737600,7,4015,4.633426966292135
5536480,4,B00AZNEVNE,"Not sure if 'enjoyed' is quite the word I would use to describe this film. Interesting, poignant, real. Life in the low wage economy. Street fighting for money. Dancing with whales. Fluid relationships like the employment market: you take what you can. Then you meet someone and take her home. ""No kissing, not yet,"" just penetration.

My review title refers to a song heard early on in the film by John Cooper Clarke called Evidently Chickentown. The poem fits where Politics is never heard. A relationship film about left and right. But you will need some knowledge of the French language to catch that perspective. Courage is another word that comes to mind. For all the extreme events that occur in the film, it is the relationship between two young people which is most engrossing. Complimentary attraction.

Even though the plot flirts with familiar territory it does so in a way that is still memmorable to you.
Everyone makes poor choices until you meet that someone who will inspire you to beat the odds and rise above, and that is what happens to Ali when he meets Stephanie.
Though Stephanie is scarred physically and has to come to terms with her new way of life, Ali is scarred emotionally and he deals with it through causing pain to others.
In a way they complement each other, drawing power from each other's slowly recuperating mental inabilities.
I really loved how Ali handled seeing Stephanie for the first time after the accident and of his lack of inhibitions over her current situation.
It is an unquestionably harsh movie that takes you through the grieving process of one's loses and what it takes to set your soul alight once again.",1363219200,9,986,4.607954545454546

5536483,4,B00AZNEVNE,"I'm writing this review in defense of 'Rust and Bone' after seeing EW's Owen Gleiberman pick it as one of his ""Worst Movies of 2012.""  Granted, this latest offering from French director Jacques Audiard doesn't measure up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Prophet-Un-proph-te/dp/B003ULSSAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Prophet (Un proph?te)</a>, but that's like taking Francis Ford Coppola to task for not matching the greatness of 'The Godfather' (no, that's not sacrilege: 'A Prophet' is that good).

Gleiberman gripes that star Marion Cotillard is ""forced to flail and mood-swing from scene to scene [and] (i)n an insult to the disabled, there is never much to her but her hellacious injury.""

I'm wondering what movie he saw.  What we saw was what we thought was a very realistic depiction of the trauma and long period of despair that someone involved in a catastrophic injury of this nature would endure.  Far from there being ""never much to her but her hellacious injury,"" Cotillard's character does, to the contrary, get light back in her life through the most unlikeliest of sources: Matthias Schoenaerts' brawling, ""operational"" (see the movie) Alain.  Witness her smile-filled reunion with her erstwhile workmates at their SeaWorld-like employer or her obvious delight at being thrust into a managerial role at Alain's unsanctioned backstreet brawls.

Call this also a defense of Audiard, who I believe is the world's best director (and a personal favorite along with Israel's Eran Riklis and Eytan Fox).  Audiard has released four brilliant movies:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Read-My-Lips/dp/B00009OOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Read My Lips</a>&nbsp;(2001) - A brawling, magnetic Vincent Cassel and beguiling Emmanuelle Devos (note: it's a state law to use the word 'beguiling' with Ms. Devos)

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beat-That-My-Heart-Skipped/dp/B000B9EYFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beat That My Heart Skipped</a>&nbsp;(2005) - A brawling, magnetic Romain Duris raises holy h-ll as part of a crew doing ugly business for property owners while battling the other side of personality (the part that stifles a talent with classical piano). Niels Arestrup and his piercing eyes are brilliant as Duris' father

A Prophet (see link above) (2009) - Indescribably good.  This and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-of-Others/dp/B000V4NX04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives of Others</a>&nbsp;and 1a and 1b (and, on other days, 1b and 1a) on my personal list.  The tension leading up to Malik and Reyeb's prison encounter might make you hyperventilate (when we saw it in the theater, two people in front of us couldn't take the pressure and fled).  Niels Arestrup shows up again here.  Again, he's brilliant.

Audiard's films aren't about the gauzy, love-filled Paris streets of grandes coles graduates.  They're about the gritty underbelly of France - the immigrants, the dispossessed, the laborers, the street-educated.  Every minute you spend watching his work rewards you with fascination and knowledge.",1356739200,44,3212,6.261363636363637
5536484,4,B00AZNEVNE,"Topless shots of Marion Cotillard have been floating around the internet and have had people talking about ""Rust and Bone"" for months now. If you avoid the trailers, your mindset will be something along the lines of ""Oh, this is that movie where Marion Cotillard gets naked and loses her legs."" However, if you've seen ""Bullhead,"" then Matthias Schoenaerts should be a name you recognize and if you've seen ""A Prophet"" then Jacques Audiard is a name you should at least be intrigued with. There's been a lot of buzz and a positive reputation surrounding ""Rust and Bone"" and thankfully it's for a good reason.

Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) leaves Belgium with his son Sam (Armand Verdure) and moves in with his sister and her husband in Antibes, southern France. After getting a job as a bouncer, Ali meets a whale trainer named Stephanie (Marion Cotillard). They're mostly somewhat civil to each other at first, but after Stephanie has an incident at work where she loses her legs their relationship only seems to grow stronger. Meanwhile, Ali's selfishness begins to take a toll on everyone in his life that he cares about.

Pay attention to the opening credits. You don't have to take notes or anything silly like that, but just have those images play through the back of your mind as your eyes and ears watch the events that unfold throughout the rest of the film. These credits are done in a way that originally seem very abstract and look to be just a series of images strung together for artistic integrity, but there's more to them than that. There's a reason you're seeing these images flash before your eyes.

This is kind of a difficult film to watch, but not for the obvious reasons. Growing up without a father, the scenes where Ali improperly parents Sam, neglects him, or forgets to pick him up at school because he was too self involved hit harder than they probably should have. Witnessing Ali be so irresponsible is the most difficult part, but watching Stephanie put up with so much of it is also infuriating at times.

There was a lot of talk about Matthias Schoenaerts outshining Marion Cotillard here and you can't really argue with that. Cotillard does a splendid job with her character. Stephanie is obviously very unhappy with her life and is on the verge of killing herself at times after the tragedy. Cotillard portrays depression and getting back on her feet (in a manner of speaking) extremely well. Imagining Schoenaerts outdo his performance in ""Bullhead"" was almost impossible, but he does so here in the final act. The moments of him with his son out on the ice and the entire hospital scene are just so haunting and powerful.

You can usually guess what's going to happen before it does, but the way the camera positions itself it's as if it's preparing you for it as well. After Stephanie loses her legs, she refuses to go outside due to being ashamed, embarrassed, and afraid of what people might say. Take note of how bright the light sources are when Ali first starts visiting Stephanie again. There are some really dynamic angles utilized in the film as well like being propped on the handlebars of a scooter or attached to the side of an 18-wheeler as it drives through every type of weather imaginable.

""Rust and Bone"" is a pretty outstanding film. Its one downside is that it isn't seamless and it sloppily jumps back and forth from heavily following Ali at first, then switching gears and revolving around Stephanie for awhile, and finally coming back around to Ali. The characters are apparently very true to the setting, but it's difficult to get behind them. It almost seems like they're asking for it at times, but you want to stick around to see when it all hits the fan. While they do make human mistakes, you wonder if anyone can be this selfish, stupid, or would actually allow themselves to be used as a doormat. With the exceptional performances from both Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard and the beautiful cinematography, ""Rust and Bone"" may have a few flaws but it's still brutal, intense, and surprisingly touching.",1356134400,13,4078,4.760961810466761
5536485,4,B00AZNEVNE,"So far I've seen only two kinds of films from director Audiard.  Excellent (A Profit, Read My Lips), and very good,
which covers everything else.

This is a complex friendship/love story between a down on his luck, self-involved fighter who is struggling to care
for his son, and an injured trainer of Orcas.

While it has been derided by some for being a melodramatic film, to me it feels like Audiard doesn't go for the easy emotions
past what the basic situation imparts. Indeed there's a subtle, almost delicate sense of remove, of observing, that, for me, keeps
this from ever feeling obvious or manipulative. In fact, it kept me from the kind of deep involvement that would have raised it
from very good to excellent.

The characters are complex and full of very human flaws, and the lead performances by Marion Cotillard and Matthias
Schoenaerts are both top notch.

The film bitterly divided critics. Most either raved without qualification, or thought it was mediocre at best. I fall in between,

Every character wasn't always likable which also kept it real, but I kept wanting to find out what was motivating them, and what they'd do next. The main stars just draw you into them. The decay of rust, the blood and bone-shattering moments and the capacity of the human spirit to endure, meet, even overcome by believably average people helps us consider our challenges in a different light. An examination of our animal nature and if love makes a difference, can people so devastated and disabled in different ways, so evidently in tremendous pain and cut off in more ways than one find their way?

There is a bit of violence, but mainly related to Alains boxing. The 2 leads are amazing, and when the camera fixes on their faces for a few seconds longer than usual, every nuanced tiny movement, or sustained one, rings true. And, I must confess, if some sequence of events in a film feels unnatural, I tend to sniff it out like bad oil. Heres an example of how the attention to detail doesnt skip a beat: Stephanie, in her depressed state, wears the same top, and it smells.  Shes not suddenly seen in a bunch of different ones. Her friend sorts tops out with her, and then shes viewed in different attire- a small detail, but in such a dark mind-state, it would take a buddy, just to help with the basics. The lead characters are not one-dimensional; they're bodied out, and they screw up. Alains 5-year-old son, Sam, is well-played by Armand Verdure.  Acting is solid across the board.  Direction by Jacques Audiard is pretty flawless. The screenplay is excellent, co-written by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain, from Craig Davidsons story.  Stephane Fontaines cinematography, coupled with Juliette Welflings editing, is top-notch, as is Desplats music. All filmmaking disciplines work. I hesitated a couple of days to view the film, pretty fearful of what happens to this great girl, but don't miss it. Its edifying, enlightening, pleasing, sexy, and not sappy.
