2203817,5,B000777HYI,"Wow, she truly was the deadly china doll.  Love all her films she has been in.  In the 1970's you had too actress' that were action film stars, Pam Grier and Angela Mao; in the 2000's we have none. Too bad they have no assertive female heros in action films like her.  My, how time has gone backwards.",1218844800,3,301,4.155172413793103
2203818,1,B000777HYI,"Quite a good film from Angela Mao,but a very bad print,even by the worst of the Kung Fu prints that are available.
Its in full Widescreen ,but mastered from an old VHS tape.
 There is also a very green color cast on the film throughout.

Sound is also very bad.
all high end no middle or bass with a bad hum.

If you must have it,as a Angela Mao fan its watchable...
  Having said the above I quite enjoyed it.",1212796800,6,410,4.075
2203819,5,B000777HYI,"I really like Angela Mao so I thought this dvd set was great.

It is true the picture quality isn't too good on 'Sting Of The Dragon Master'.

'Dance Of Death' is very artistic and somewhat of a comedy.  The settings really take you back to long ago China.

But one of my all time favorite movies is 'Moonlight Sword And Jade Lion'.

I think I like it because the main idea is Angela goes out on her own to find a friend of her father's and find out the truth about her parents' murder.

A sub plot is this guy has one of a pair of jade lions and if he gets the other one he will become 'master of the Kung Fu world'.  However it's not clear to me why.

The sound on 'Moonlight Sword' is bad and it's in the wide screen format.  On my tv this only uses about 50 percent of the available screen.  I don't understand why people like this format.

This was a different time in history where there was no mass communications.  This guy wants to have a meeting with someone so he throws a knife at the guy's face and shouts ""Get in touch with me."".

There's also two guys who I think are twins (one the good guy and one the villain) and they kill people by throwing big knives into the back of their heads just when they are going to say something important.

""You don't understand.  It wasn't our fault.  We were under orders from .......UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !""

To me the greatest scene is Angela gets surrounded by these gals who are carrying explosive flowers.  She takes them all out with her telescopic spear.

Then she goes into the 'temple of doom' that has various hazards such as flying saw blades.

2203820,3,B000777HYI,"I can't say for certain if any of you will think this is a great collection to have! Here let me explain the movies!

DANCE OF DEATH

Dance Of Death is a movie about Mao who plays a orphan boy who seeks revenge against a bird clan for killing her friends! The movie is in original language, widescreen with chinese/english subtitles! The picture has some white snowflakes and stuff but overall the movie is watchable! The kung fu is great in this one! Choreographed by Jackie Chan! Or at least that's what the box says!

STING OF THE DRAGON MASTER

Mao plays some Chinese girl who helps a group of Korean rebels against a Japanese Samurai Clan! The picture is awful! It's fullscreen, the picture quality looks beyond b-movie, you'll mostly see white, and to boot it has english subtitles and the movie is english dub! The kung fu would be good if not for the full screen cuz most the fights were to close!

MOONLIGHT SWORD AND JADE LION

Mao is on the search for her masters brother so she can find out who killed her family! The movie is in widescreen and the picture is good enough! BUT the movie is english dubbed! :( And the sound quality is extremely bad! You'll have to turn your t.v. all the way up in order to hear this one! This was probably the fault of Venom Mob company cuz this could be easily fixed! The kung fu action is descent nothing to special!

So all in all, this is quite a questionable product! There is nothing broken as far as how the DVD's play! The Dvd's work perfectly! But all I can say is either just get Dance of Death by itself (get Venom Mob/Crash Cinema version cuz Ground Zero version is english dubbed and fullscreen) cuz that was a tight kung fu movie, or if you are a hardcore advocate of Angela Mao (she's so sexy when she kills someone) or of kung fu cinema then by all means get this baby! Otherwise, if you are nik-picky about picture or sound quality then I advise against this product!",1111795200,25,1929,4.3565459610027855
