7333310,2,B011ID11QY,"Extremely disappointing.  I kept waiting most of the movie for something to happen.  Most of it was just the poor guy rambling a bunch of stuff that made no sense.  I could not believe when I looked to see how many minutes were left that I was at the end of the movie with nothing happening yet.  The camera is very shaky, especially at the end and they barely show you the creature.  You get small glimpses and poor ones at that of it.  There was barely any story to the movie it was just plain awful.  I wish I could get a refund.",1441152000,5,532,4.0576923076923075

7333316,5,B011ID11QY,"So so SO good. And I'm a tough critic. The cast is spectacular, the tension never lets you go, and without spoiling anything, what lies in the basement is bloody terrifying.

7333317,4,B011ID11QY,"Martin (Brian Morvant) is a PTSD veteran whose dog was just killed. He lives in a cabin by the lake and informs his brother not to come up, which means his psychologist/counselor brother Ed (Dean Cates) and alcoholic sister Lyla (Lauren Ashley Carter) drive up to help the ""Maine-iac."" They find Martin talking wildly wielding a gun babbling about a killing soldier called a ""pod."" He claims he was part of an army experiment being fed pills etc. and that he had seen the pod. He has one trapped in the basement. Martin has shaved portions of his head and has even removed the ""tracking device"" in his tooth using a pliers. Ed believes Martin has had a relapse and needs help. Lyla buys into the far fetched tale.

The acting on this film was solid. Brian Morvant did a crazy person that drove me crazy. Likewise Dean Cates and Lauren Ashley Carter seemed to have nailed their roles in this low budget film. The movie camera angle was mostly a first person angle giving the production a hand held camera feel, but without the jerking camera. The film was a bit short (76 minutes) and the explanation didn't come until the end...except it didn't give closure.

Good suspense horror too.

7333319,4,B011ID11QY,"Not sure why this has so many low marks...  I thought it was actually quite good...

I tried looking up the budget, but pretty much everything just says shoe-string without any actual numbers...  anyway...

Despite the constant yelling between all the characters, I thought the acting was very well done all around.  And, the constant fighting inherently increases the tension / suspense in the movie.  The audio and soundtrack were on point.  Camera work was good ( some perhaps ""too"" dark shots, but not many, and they worked with the movie ).  And, I thought the special effects / monster looked good as well.

So, yeah...  4 stars.  Good level of suspense...  Pretty good scare factor.  I liked it.",1517443200,,702,4.798319327731092

7333321,5,B011ID11QY,The movie was very well scripted in my opinion. Am I hoping to see a pod 2? If that is possible? Wanting to know what he truly meant at the very end of the movie. Also the I guess third bother had a really good acting.,1516406400,,218,3.760869565217391
7333322,2,B011ID11QY,"For a dumb, let's-get-some-friends-together-and-make-a-cheap-horror movie, the production values on POD are pretty good...the movie at least DOES look like a professional picture. The plot is barely-there, the twists aren't very twisty, and the acting is way over the top...especially by Lauren Ashley Carter as the highly-strung little sister who joins her older brother in a rescue of another of their brothers, one seemingly suffering a PTSD breakdown in his remote, lake-side home. Somewhere in amongst his hysterical ranting they kind of understand moments of clarity about aliens and secret government experiments and things locked in his basement and yadda yadda yadda. Worth about an hour and ten minutes...and thank god that's the film's run time. And Larry Fessenden's always fun, here in a small part.",1512518400,,812,5.504

7333324,3,B011ID11QY,"Interesting film. The movie manages to evoke some actual suspense and twice surprised me with the turns it took. Overall a decent little movie that passes quickly. The acting is not terrible, but will not earn any awards either. Still the actors do a pretty good turn with material that I enjoyed, until the very last scene. This last scene is so predictable, and childish, it feels like the worst of the youtube jump scare videos out there. The ending, all in all is relatively nonsensical and leaves more questions than it answers. I would say it's a decent popcorn flick for a slow day, and shows a lot of promise, but doesn't quite land.",1500508800,,641,4.582608695652174
7333325,1,B011ID11QY,"Maybe this could have been at least three stars, but there was nothing in this movie to convince me that it deserved two stars. I always look for at least a few exciting moments, but there was none. It dragged on endlessly in poor acting, and even the characters were boring. To give you a brief synopsis, giant pods are spotted in many parts of the world, Experts are called in, including a linguist  who is a total genius, and translates into English the communication technique of the alien visitors. All over the world, there is panic, and the threat of war. If you really want to spend precious hours watching this, opt for a good read to pass the time.

7333328,4,B011ID11QY,"This is a nice effort for a horror film which is very much like a long X-Files episode. A PTSD war veteran is staying at his familys remote Maine cabin and comes across something in the woods. His behaviour becomes erratic and his brother and sister come out to see if they can help him.

I guess it's a bit predictable from here: most of the film is a battle between the ill brother and his siblings. The monster element is only revealed late in the film, and I'm not really sure what the 'Pod' reference was all about...

The acting here was generally above par but the lead actress' constant saucer eyes did get a bit wearing and at times she came across as being a bit unbalanced herself which I''m not sure was the filmmakers intention.

However all this is minor as the film is well made and quite entertaining, if very short at 78 minutes all up.

I bought 'Pod' in Sydney on Blu-ray and this was great for the outdoor forest and lake scenes and the DTS-HD MA soundtrack had some good surround effects.",1467417600,,1009,4.351063829787234

7333331,3,B011ID11QY,"I never would have known about this independent horror film except that my friends recently reviewed it on their podcast, so I thought I'd watch it before I listened to the episode.

Here are my thoughts (in 3 sections, the last of which includes spoilers).

Pros:

* very strong, if not exactly original, premise. Sick Gulf War vet with apparent schizophrenia and PTSD claims to have apprehended an alien ""pod"" which he recognizes from nefarious government experiments he witnessed during the service and which he now has sealed within his basement. His brother and sister come to check on him and are subjected to his rantings and ravings, which the sister believes and the brother does not. really nice source of dramatic tension

* Reminiscent of a decent, if not great, episode of the X-Files, only focusing on the crazy victims and no Mulder and Scully present

* Love that it relies on mood and setting and ambiguity to build suspense rather than action sequences or gore. The film managed to stir up a certain amount of dread during the best moments

Cons:

* Mediocre acting and straight-up stupid dialogue. If you're going to have a horror movie where terror is built through characterization and dialogue rather than onscreen butchery, you better have some pretty strong writing. This script was disappointingly amateurish. The brother and sister's performances ranged from boring to passable, but the guy playing the crazy vet was a horrible actor and delivered his admittedly stupid lines poorly. Also, his costume and hairstyle looked EXACTLY like Travis Bickle from TAXI DRIVER. If only he had borrowed De Niro's acting abilities rather than his costume.

* Overly intrusive and distracting score and sound effects. The filmmaker laid it on thick with the ""scary"" and ""eerie"" music (the captions even said ""eerie music continues"") and weird alien screeching sound effects coming from nowhere. I think the same music and noises would have been effective if used more sparingly, but the extent and volume at which they were played started to grow wearisome.

**SPOILERS BELOW**
RANDOM COMPLAINT:
The movie poster clearly shows some kind of pod or alien egg a la ALIEN and the titular ""pod"" is mentioned onscreen about 100 times, yet we are not allowed a glimpse of the pod at any time. Now I wouldn't normally complain about this. I think it would be bold and interesting if someone made a scary movie about Bigfoot that never actually SHOWED Bigfoot, but that's not what is happening here. In fact, in the final act of the movie we are allowed many unobscured glimpses at the monster that COMES OUT OF THE pod. It appears to be some sort of lumpy, spidery, humanoid resembling a cross between the classic ""gray"" and a zombie. It's only mildly scary. My feeling is if you're going to show the monster onscreen, you might as well show the pod too. I really wanted to see the pod.

CONCLUSION: Not a terrible movie, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it if I were you.",1454284800,3,2985,4.8011695906432745
7333332,4,B011ID11QY,"I liked the movie, as in general I like all of Fessenden's work, and is beyond the feeling of solidarity for someone who you say ""hi"" to on Avenue A doing good; I am not sure if I would have given this a four due to (what I hope were) budgetary constraints, but the bile of other reviewers inspired a contrary reaction in me - what baseline is being used? Kubrick? and sure, there are times when a lot is asked in suspending belief, but since when does not having a plot spelled out for the viewer equal  lazy or irresolute by the filmmaker? Aren't the same critics those who whinge when everything is ""too"" coincidental, pat, wrapped up and easily digestible?

7333334,1,B011ID11QY,"There was a good concept for a plot but it was rather poorly executed. Didn't really keep my attention, I thought it was boring from start to finish. The three actors were okay at first but when it gets to the more quickly paced scenes they start over-acting like crazy. One of them has a hair style so distracting that I couldn't focus on what he was rambling about. The fourth actor was...definitely in the movie. There were a ton of unneeded long shots that didn't seem to have any other purpose than to make the run time longer. Lastly, a warning for all those who may experience seizures, in the very last scene, they have a super bright flashing light. Its not in the distance its straight at the camera and there is no purpose for it. Its just there. Dont waste your time on this film.",1453680000,,792,4.358108108108108

Those initial set-up moments almost had me considering turning it off due to less-than-stellar acting, but I'm glad I stayed with it because it really is a creepy film, one of the better ones in the genre I've seen lately.  You really to watch this to the end to see what, if anything, is in the guy's basement. ""Watch again?"" factor for me is 95%",1451606400,,597,4.613207547169812

7333343,2,B011ID11QY,"I can't recommend you buy this movie.  Maybe just get it as a rental if you're really into alien movies. The acting isn't bad, it's the script that ruins the movie.  And, it's so bad, it makes the acting seem awkward and forced most of the time.  There's a lot of talking and not enough action.  And, when they do stop talking long enough for there to be action it's because one of the characters just did something really stupid. There's really only one scare that I recall and that was just because something jumps out at you on the screen.  There's also one kind of shocking moment I admit I didn't see coming.  But, those do not make this movie at all worth watching. However, if you want to check it out anyways because you're like me and enjoy alien movies and creature features, then I would just rent it instead of buying it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pod/dp/B013PNF6T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pod</a>",1444608000,3,961,5.050632911392405

The acting is solid, though the sister gets annoying with her constant screaming.  Can we get rid of this cliche in horror movies? The writing is the most terrifying thing in this movie. In order to even attempt to make this movie work, the characters have to do things that no one in their right mind would do.  The set up of this movie is great. It's enough to keep you interested. Until you see what's locked in the basement.  I don't know about you, but that was not a ""pod"".  And this movie has some of the worse costuming I've ever seen.  It looks like they hired someone from that horrible SciFi moster making series to create this travesty of a monster. Looks like someone took generic Reynolds Wrap and covered an extra.  The Creature from the Black Lagoon was more terrifying.  This is a constant theme from these awful Amazon movies being made free to Prime members.
