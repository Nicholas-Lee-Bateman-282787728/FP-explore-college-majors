2449973,4,B000BZ8IG2,"Desert Punk has a style which is somewhat unique, both visually and audially. The visual style fits the desert environment and the bleakness well. Weapons are realistic, and there are enough harsh sunlight scenes to make you feel like you're in the desert too.

The characters are fun too. The Desert Punk is an adolescent boy who has earned his rep as Demon of the Desert, but is easily distracted by beautiful women. Junko, the siren with massive bounciness, provides both fan-service and a distraction/rivalry for the Punk. Then there's Rain Spider, an ominous debt-collector. Each character is a fun character without being too stereotypical.

The audio tracks were hilarious. Since most characters didn't have visible lips, it allowed the voice actors to be more liberal in their translations. The English-dubbing crew must have had a blast, particularly Desert Punk's actor. Listen to his lines while distracted by Junko, and you'll bust a gut too. Just don't let kids watch this one.

The extras on the disc are also good. They include voice-actor auditions, a making-of short about the live-action title sequence, and even a short segment from Mr. Stain.

There were a few drawbacks on the disk, though not with the story. The first one is apparent as soon as you start up the disk - previews that you cannot skip or fast-forward through. The voice actor auditions were a nice touch, but it would have been nice to see something aside from the logo for the entire set of auditions.

Overall, a good disk, and a lot of fun.",1149033600,5,1530,4.846743295019157
2449974,5,B000BZ8IG2,"I watched this without knowing anything about it. I just sat down and started watching. I actually kinda sorta understood what was going on. I would say this is not for everybody. It has violence bad language. But i watched the censored version. I don't think thats included on the dvd. From what i can tell its pretty good. He is a short what seems to be bounty hunter that is a legend. Kind of an adult themed Fullmetal alchemist, except instead of alchemy, weapons. This is not for kids, but would reccomend if you're looking for something interesting.",1141776000,2,555,4.616161616161616
2449975,4,B000BZ8IG2,"Desert Punk is one of those anime that just really isn't needed, but is hilarious nonetheless. Filled with plenty of over-the-top fan-service (the kind meant to draw laughs more than to titillate) and a very liberal translation from Japanese to English, it takes ridiculousness to new levels. Besides simple hilarity, though, it has some great moments of action and a unique style of animation, hinting at classical but keeping with the more modern standards.

The story follows a young bounty hunter known as the Desert Punk--or Kanta--as he sifts through The Great Kanto Desert in the attempt to find his bounty. Though the world is destroyed (like in a lot of anime) Desert Punk is perfectly suited to the harsh weather as he wears plenty of special gear and carries with him enough weaponry to start a war. But what he isn't prepared for is the occasionally beautiful woman, and he will often dive into things he would normally leave alone all in an attempt to impress the ladies. In this volume, he meets two such women, as well as a couple of skilled bounty hunters out to claim the prize of Desert Punk.

Now for the DVD. Funimation is the king of special features, as they don't just settle for text-less openings and closings (though in this case, this is actually a good special feature since the opening and closing are funny and informative). This DVD contains the original Japanese extras, as well as a few American produced extra features including cast auditions, character profiles, and an edited version of Desert Punk that's actually kind of funny. Beyond that, the limited edition version has a camo hat for those of you interested in anime memorabilia.

Because the fan-service in this series can be a bit extreme at times, and the language goes just to the fringe of the ""f"" word without saying it, I can't really recommend this to a younger audience. But if you enjoy anime like New Cutey Honey, Mezzo, or Golden Boy, then Desert Punk is definitely something you might want to check out. Also, if you're a GONZO collector, then I'd recommend Desert Punk to you as well.",1141430400,14,2091,4.754820936639119
2449976,5,B000BZ8IG2,i bought this dvd only seeing a trailer for it on my samurai 7 collection. let me tell you it was well worth the risk and the dollar. this is a very dark comedy style of anime. it stars a young hero (in a sense) forging his way through life in a desolate desert. his only companion is his trusty shotgun and bag of tricks. don't be fooled though he also encounters other forms of life that spark his lustful interests and his undying thirst for money. i will say this about the desert punk he is quite perverted so if you don't like anime with bouncing breasts every 5 minutes this probably isn't for you. there's also a big piece of the description of desert punk that i'm leaving out but that's for you to find out. it's very suprising. i highly recommend this for any adult anime collector.,1141257600,5,793,4.293333333333333

8094692,3,B000BZ8IG2,"The anime is good. The problem that I am facing is that the video is corrupted. I purchased this video through Prime Instant Video. There is about a Seven second lag between the audio and the video, making it unwatchable. I am sorely disappointed and will be less likely to purchase instant videos if this is not fixed in the near future. I will be happy to change my rating when this is done.

Edit: The lag only occurs on the Kindle Fire even after downloading an episode. Also no lag is present in other Prime Instant Videos.

8094693,4,B000BZ8IG2,"Desert Punk is a ridiculous anime. That's what makes it great. There is not much of a point, other than making you laugh. There's no point explaining the story since the story doesn't matter. The animation, voice acting, dialogue, and comedy are all very well done. Despite being very low brow, this anime is entertaining, and a bit addicting. It's a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. If you want to laugh a lot Desert Punk is for you.",1353888000,,437,4.407407407407407
8094694,5,B000BZ8IG2,"I had seen this title on the Anime rental rack at Hastings Books & Records for months and months.  I thought the titular character looked kind of stupid in his gear and really wasn't interested.  Then I happened to catch a trailer of this series on another DVD and it piqued my interest, especially the gratuitous Fanservice.  After having taken in a lot of good but somewhat estrogen-soaked anime lately, this was a refreshing change that made me laugh out loud.  Think ""Mad Max"" action combined with slapstick.  The animated classic HEAVY METAL is probably a distant relative of this style of sci-fi comedy.  If you liked the original HEAVY METAL you will probably get a kick out of this anime.

The English dub dialogue is at slightly more variance than usual for Anime, but it pays off in laughs for the viewer.  Some humor is universal, while in other cases you have to go for the best analogue rather than an exacting translation.  I approve the decisions made by the ADR director in that regard, as it makes this show side-splittingly funny.  It's so outrageous, so over-the-top you can't help and laugh.  The main hero, Desert Punk, has an uncanny ""Dukes-of-Hazzard"" style way of escaping seemingly impossible jams that would stop a lesser man.  Desert Punk is an unscrupulous rogue but so irrepressible you can't help but root for him; sort of a short, sandy Han Solo.  Like any hormone fueled teenage male he's drawn to guns, hi-tech, and chicks like a magnet.

The narrator is also very sarcastic, noting that the surviving remnants of the lost civilization really haven't learned anything from the devastation and are really just as corrupt and stupid as their ancestors, perhaps even more so.

This is definitely an anime aimed at guys of all ages.  Sensitive female viewers would be advised to pass this one up, but bawdy chicks and tomboys who like to hang out as ""one of the guys"" will probably enjoy it, too.  The buxom female protagonist (and Desert Punk's new rival) can more than hold her own and gets some of the best lines and sometimes beats Desert Punk at his own game.  Imagine Kaname and Sagura of Full Metal Panic but with Kaname a little more like Sgt. Mao, and Sagura more of a hot-to-trot pervert.  Speaking of Kaname, actress Luci Christian does lend her voice talents to the last episode in this volume, playing a female child character who will probably be an enduring character in the series.  I *heart* Luci.  (and Monica, and Hillary, and...)

If you can get past the inherent goofy looks of Desert Punk's outfit, and let yourself enjoy the series on its own terms, you will be richly rewarded with a post-apocalyptic farce that will leave you in stiches.  At least if you're a dude.",1229472000,,2719,4.701902748414376
8094695,4,B000BZ8IG2,this is a very good series lots of action and fan service good times oh yeah.,1224028800,,77,3.875
8094696,5,B000BZ8IG2,"This is really funny. Well, it might seem foul in the language and behavior sometimes. However, I do not find it offensive. Besides the action, gun firing, jumping and fighting, it tells us something really insidious. The background is actually quite horrifying. I cannot imagine the great Kanto desert is a future representative image of the nowadays Tokyo and the nearby cities. The story does not actually says the deserted land is our Tokyo, etc at present. But it gives me an impression of such...People fight consistently in obtaining the goods and money. Because I have not watched the series to the end so I cannot affirm what kind of thought which is hidden in this anime. Surely, I will keep watching to the end of it.",1174003200,,728,4.74015748031496
8094697,2,B000BZ8IG2,"Desert Punk Enter The Desert never had a chance.  It felt like they tried TOO hard.  The characters are interesting, the music is good, the plots on the other hand felt old, mostly about money, and the setting is too Post-World War Three 1980s movie for my taste.  You know, the ones they made with little money, rusty cars and actors nobody knew.  In other words they mixed some good stuff with worn out ideas anybody could copy from older animes.  Put it all together and you get episodes with nothing to really dig you're teeth into.  It felt like a vague remake of earlier animes - like I had seen it all before.

Interesting extras but that failed to save it.",1151193600,,664,4.39344262295082
