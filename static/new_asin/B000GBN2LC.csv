8130548,5,B000GBN2LC,"When you view this movie, you need to pay close attention.  It is slightly hard to follow at times, but as in many of Pierce Brosnan's movies it takes its twist and turns.  The ending is a surprise, but Pierce always gives his best performance in any movie he stars in.",1389830400,,269,4.254901960784314
8130549,1,B000GBN2LC,"This is a totally misguided and campy adaptation of what might be one of Boileau-Narcejac's best novels, ""Les Veufs"" (The Widowers.) For some reason, the filmmakers chose to tell the story in non-linear fashion and interspersed it with absolutely unnecessary and unappealing erotic scenes. Most of the cast is just inept while Pierce Brosnan is ridiculously over-the-top.",1385856000,,371,5.526315789473684
