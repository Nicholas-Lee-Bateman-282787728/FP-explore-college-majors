1201797,5,B00000F2AF,"Three sisters living/working in a cafe in contemporary Vietnam wrestle with love, death and pregnancy in this spectacular film. From the director of SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA, this visually sumptuous film is like a soap opera vietnamese style. The story is slow to unfold, like the opening of a lotus blossom, and just as rewarding. This was my top choice of the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival.",1005955200,,400,4.985074626865671
1201877,5,B00000F2AF,"The distinct impression of Vietnam director Tran Anh Hung has given us through his films is one of sensual beauty. Whereas in ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" the main focus was on nature, here Tran has turned his camera loose in much the same way on a Vietnamese family, and it proves a richly flavored cuisine.

The story revolves around three beautiful sisters of various ages, all living together as a family unit. Two sisters are married and one of those has a child. Together with a younger brother, an extended and supportive family unit is formed in Hanoi. While Tran captures the beauty outside their home, he begins to focus on what lies beneath the surface, and what begins as a tiny sprinkle, becomes a steady rain of sensuality.

The outward happiness and tranquility of this extended family belies what Tran shows us, pulling back the curtain slowly to reveal deep secrets and shocking deceptions. Always present is the search for the truth regarding the romance of their parents, led by the sisters, which is shrouded in mystery.

Ravishingly beautiful Tran Nu Yen Khe portrays the single sister, Lien. She and her older brother have a flirtatious relationship that causes many on the streets of Hanoi to mistakenly believe they are a couple. Only in the final moments of this film will we come to understand history may be repeating itself.

The lush foilage of Vietnam and the lovely city of Hanoi are wonderfully brought to life by Tran, and an excellent sountrack enhances the unique atmosphere of another impressionistic rendering of a place and its people by a director with a unique vision. Perhaps Tran's greatest achievement here, however, is a feeling of sensuality you can almost touch. Once again he has turned a movie into a film, and that film into art.

1201878,2,B00000F2AF,I thought the characters & script were trite & uninteresting. The cinematography was quite nice. The film was also overly slow without much of real interest.,1268697600,,157,5.076923076923077
1201879,4,B00000F2AF,"THE VERTICAL RAY OF THE SUN (made in 2001) was my official introduction to Vietnamese cinema, and, I must say this is a very beautiful and evocative piece.  Set in modern day Hanoi, Vietnam, it examines the lives of a group of brothers and sisters (in law) living together, following the death of their parents.  The deceptively placid atmosphere thinly veils the thick and complicated family dynamics (as well as secrets) that eventually threaten to tear this closely knit family unit apart.  What's more, all of this drama features the crooning of Velvet Underground vocalist Lou Reed, as part of the haunting (and slightly sinister) soundtrack and musical backdrop, as well as gorgeous cinematography.  Every scene appears illuminated and drips with bold color (rich greens, strong reds).  This offsets beautiful shots of flora and fauna, as well as the actors' faces.

This film conveys so much, visually, that oftentimes dialogue isn't even necessary.  I forgot that this was in Vietnamese, many times, while I watched the interactions between the actors.  It truly is like a beautiful moving painting.  I can almost smell the lemongrass and the tea, and I felt the rain on my cheeks as I watched it cascade around the house where much of the story takes place.  THE VERTICAL RAY OF THE SUN truly whet my appetite for Vietnamese cinema, and I can't wait to watch more films from this beautiful country.",1190505600,2,1407,4.948936170212766
1201880,5,B00000F2AF,"This is one of the most cinematographically beautiful films I've seen. The shots along Halong Bay and within Hanoi are stunning and the lyrical beauty of the opening scenes, with the Velvet Underground's Pale Blue Eyes as the accompanying music, is second to none. The plot moves well and sustains the viewer's interest as it tracks the lives of three sisiters and their brother in contemporary Hanoi. Sensational.",1174780800,2,414,5.102941176470588
1201881,4,B00000F2AF,"This is one of my favoritest movies.  The cinematography in this film is visually eloquent, to say the least.  The story unfolds hypnotically; its charisma expressed through rhythmic allegory.  Simply BeatyFull.  Plus, a soundtrack that features Lou Reed and eccentric passionate love scenes.

It is not for those looking for a straightforward climax of sensory overload as we are accustomed to in Holywood theaters. However, it is a nice glimpse at another culture...It makes me wanna go to vietnam and wake up. Maybe go for a bike-ride in the rain. ;P",1167782400,3,553,5.032967032967033
1201882,4,B00000F2AF,"A wonderful film by master director Tran Anh Hung who gave us a series of equally well directed productions.

This film is all about human relations blend with wonderful music and exceptional photography.

The actors took up their roles in a balanced way with each one able to show his/her best while at the same time to complement each other in a harmony of acting.

The music is spectacular combining well-chosen western music and Vietnamese.

It is of a particular importance to notice the sound of this film. Background sounds and effects strengthened by spending photography make the viewer to feel the heat of the tropics, the rain and humidity and the coolness of the garden.

But the most important aspect is the human relation, all presented for what they are in real life. While able to strengthen the virtues of fidelity does not condemn infidelity, while praising family ties and values does not shy away from questioning believes.

The photography is superb with the director of photography able to capture the sun, the bright areas and combine them perfectly with shades.

The contrast of the clean spotless dresses in bright colours with the run down walls of a city in the tropics is something one can notice and appreciate.

The collection of small details of the daily life that could have gone unnoticed become through the photography part of the beauty of this film.

The music is acting also as a tool of symbolism and one must pay attention to the beautiful group singing.",1154736000,5,1494,4.827450980392157
1201883,5,B00000F2AF,"As a visual artist who spends alot of time in Asian countries, I find this movie very moving... the visuals, the orderly square and rectangular compositions, the colours, and the editing, all adding up to catching SO WELL the clamness inherent in Buddhist cultures, (of which there are not as many as most assume).
Amazon accurately delineates what the film is all about.  There are surprises,,,hearing Lou Reed, discovering a house in the water of an area considered one ot the most beautiful natural places in the world, not a prostitute to be found, (unlike in the director's earlier movie ""Cyclo""), or farmers in straw hats.  The movie just briefly follows the lives of 3 male contemporay artistic professionals: an actor, a photographer and a writer, through the interactions of three sisters, who are among the five women very much involved in the men's lives.
 NOW the important stuff:  I viewed this DVD on high end equipment.
 Although anamorphic,  with this DVD,  inorder to read the second line of subtitles when a second line appears, you have to view the movie  with the ""normal"" aspect set on a widescreen t.v., resulting in a much smaller image. Is this bad? No, it is GOOD. This is a very beautiful filmed movie. Here the subtitles are NOT overlayed on top of the image, which is GREAT. So just sit closer.  I pity any viewer seeing a pan and scan version of this movie on cable t.v. and thinking they actually viewed this movie.  Highly recommend for a terrific character study of three sisters, and the men in their lives, and a perfect tone poem of the calmness that pervails all the characters' lives.",1137196800,5,1621,4.736654804270462
1201884,5,B00000F2AF,"Note: Vietnamese with English subtitles.

Director Anh Hung Tran's has followed up his academy award nominated masterpiece, 'The Scent Of Green Papaya' and 'Cyclo' with yet another cinematically lush and textured film which relies more on its visual appeal than substance of storyline. Also returning for her third appearance in an Anh Hung Tran film is the exotic and lovely Tran Nu Yen-Khe in the role of Lien, the youngest of three sisters and a brother.

Another gently flowing, beautifully filmed tapestry of color and form weaved seamlessly together in a surreal, sensual tale of Vietnamese siblings, their spouses and families. All seems happy and carefree in the beginning as you view them together planning a ceremonial dinner honoring the birthday of their deceased Mother. They harmoniously interact during both the preparation and celebration of the meal, giving every indication that all is well. However some are secretly harboring personal secrets concerning where they go and what they do when alone. Secrets that exposed would bring turmoil and disruption into their peaceful existence.

Like Anh Hung Tran's previous endeavors you go into the film knowing that it's going to be first and foremost about the visuals. Accepting that premise you will find 'The Vertical Ray of the Sun' a rewarding experience. If however you are more concerned with storyline you should look elsewhere.",1132444800,4,1400,5.2690582959641254
1201885,3,B00000F2AF,"A lush, slow moving visual mood movie with an amazing, intoxicating soundtrack. For the visual sensuality of this film alone, it is worth viewing. It makes Vietnam comes alive and certainly made me want to visit. In the film three sisters run a caf&eacute; together, but their lives are in very different places and they have different needs and desires. While there is not a great deal of action taking place here, the viewer is eventually treated to inside looks at the life of each sister and each struggle she must face. I found the film watchable mostly for its beauty, but I don't think this film will appeal to everyone.",1110758400,6,627,4.657657657657658

1201952,5,B00000F2AF,"This review refers to the DVD edition(Columbia/Tri Star) of ""The Vertical Ray Of The Sun""...

This is a film that simply takes my breath away. Not only is it a captivating story, but how refreshing it is to view a film about the beautiful people and luscious land of Vietnam without all the atrocities of the war going on around the story. The brillant photography takes it all in, and under the exquistely artful direction of Tran Anh Hung we are treated to a visual feast.

This moving story revolves around three beautiful sisters, as they prepare a traditional banquet for relatives as a memorial to their mother. Each sister has their own hopes, dreams, and secrets. As their everyday lives gives us a glimpse at life in Hanoi, we can't help but to feel close to them, as one by one their stories come to light. The fantasies they share, the indiscretions they hide, and the love and support of this close knit family, combined with the scenic backdrop of the lush country will surely take you away to another world for a while. It is a world you may want to revisit often.

The DVD presents a fabulous look at it all, in widescreen, and with its rich colors. The sound has the choice of DD5.1 or 2.0, and surrounds wonderfully. Even the rain looks and sounds crystal clear. The language is in Vietnamese and there are optional English subtitles. There are some moments in the film where the sisters or other family members are singing, and it may have been nice to have susbititles for these as well, but to tell the truth, the voices and lullaby like quality of the music were so soothing, it doesn't really matter what langauge you hear it in.

This is a film for lovers of foreign films, romantic getaways, great storytelling and fine filmmaking.

Enjoy.....Laurie",1096329600,38,1773,4.6158730158730155

1201954,4,B00000F2AF,"A cross-sectional portrayal of life in economically recovering Hanoi.  The director uses three sisters and their spouses to explore traditional and modern Vietnamese mores and values. The cinematography is intellectually interesting adding a languid feeling to the sexual tension of the nearly plotless story. This visually satisfying and semi erotic work unfolds like a lazy Sunday morning, to be enjoyed and not rushed through. Probally boring to those unaware of non-action genre films or having limited cultural perspectives. In other words you may have to think for yourself while viewing this flick.",1091836800,4,605,5.576086956521739
1201955,5,B00000F2AF,"Of course this film is beautiful--and its almost worth buying for just the cinematography--but there are levels of subtlety to this movie. The beautiful camera work compliments these levels of complexity to really make it one of those films that you couldn't understand with the screenplay alone.
The film begins on the Mother's death day and ends on the Father's, who is barely acknoledged like the Mother. This is a reflection, even though Vietnamese, of the Chinese ideas that the Female is supreme to the Male, especially in the family.",1078704000,2,540,5.011111111111111
1201956,4,B00000F2AF,"This 2000 Vietnamese film portrays a Vietnam that is unique to Westerners.  It is a Vietnam without war or poverty.
Set in modern Hanoi, in the midst of a hot lazy summer, we meet three adult sisters and are immediately drawn to each of their particular romantic melodramas.  The film moves at a slow, languid pace.  And the story unfolds quietly, in layers.
It's a simple story.  There's love, adultery, family ties.  There are secrets and upsets and pregnancies.  And sometimes it is quite boring, as the concerns of the individuals do not carry high dramatic potential.  And yet, it's nice to relax, let myself be steeped in the Vietnamese culture, and feel the very real but subtle emotions of the complex, interwoven relationships.
The parents of these three sisters have recently died and the youngest sister lives with her twin brother in a very lovely apartment where the young woman displays incestuous feelings for her brother.  The second sister is married to a man who researches plants and spends long weeks away from her.  The third sister is married to a writer who also travels.  There are infidelities and secrets and sometimes it all gets confusing.  But the mood is one of romance coupled with the lushness of the countryside.
I found the film a little too slow for my taste.  I was waiting for something outwardly exciting to happen.  But the story stayed squarely inside the psyches of the characters and because it was so well done, I cannot help but recommend it.",1073001600,3,1486,4.780392156862745
1201957,5,B00000F2AF,"This is a brilliant film. I disagree with reviewers who complain that it is slow; I think contemporary Hollywood techno-action film has unfortunately raised thresholds for ordinary moviegoers who now expect more and better pyrotechnics, sex and action. This movie is authentic, the treatment elegant with great attention to details (every frame - and frame within a frame - is exquisite) and the cast generates an amazing combination of alluring warmth, familial comfort, underlying sensuousness, and lightness that makes this a fascinating, thoroughly bewitching film. Guys, this is Vietnam, not Bel Air, not some space station about to go to war with the cosmos. It is a different world, a diffrent culture, and this film is true to it. A special mention to the use of ambient sound, as well as the surreal yet totally appropriate juxtaposition of Velvet Underground. Amazing!! At this point words fail me. The movie speaks for itself. And it doesn't have to say much to make a lasting impact.",1056585600,8,995,5.073170731707317
1201958,5,B00000F2AF,"First off, I just want to say that I am reviewing this in terms of the movie itself, not the DVD. I rented it but my place only has it on VHS. I watched it 5 times during one rent and I just have to review it. I don't know what extras the DVD does or does not have, but this movie is magical.
This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. I have a feeling that it may be too slow and thoughtful for the majority of the American audience, though. I don't see this as a fault of the movie at all. Only a fault in the bright, flashy dazzle, quick edit after quick edit style of tv, movies, sports, and commercials that Americans are surrounded by 24/7. If the picture isn't jumping around and changing every 1.3 seconds, the average American loses interest. Their (our) loss.
Scent Of Green Papaya has been a favorite of mine since I saw it a few years ago, thus when Vertical Ray showed up at the video store I had to rent it. I hate to slight Green Papaya, but now having seen both, this movie is the better of the two.
Vertical Ray is absolutely hypnotic. There are shots in this movie that take my breath away.
 tran nu yen khe (Lien) is so sensual, magnetic, and free in this movie that I can't help but fall for her. I thought I fell for her in Green Papaya, but this movie goes way beyond that one. Her emotional range with just facial expressions, not to mention words, is so alluring. She is so perfectly entrancing. It's a strange thing to say, but just she herself...the way she looks at things, talks, and moves... her face... she is a work of art in and of herself. The camera truly loves her. I really can't explain it. She may be the very definition of grace and sensuality.
I don't think there is any lack of movement in this plot or screenplay. There is a lack of explosions, gunfire, and nudity, yes, but that in no way means the movie is missing anything. Also, I didn't see it mentioned in the couple reviews I read, but there is some very funny stuff in this movie! If you don't laugh out loud a few times during this movie then you aren't paying attention!
Obviously we are all different, and maybe it's just me, but I think the director of this movie and Green Papaya, tran anh hung, is amazing. There is absolutely no one in American cinema capable of making films like these. Now I need to see Cyclo.",1056153600,15,2331,4.203125

I'm afraid it's like comedy - it can't really be explained simply. The story, involving three sisters, is rather confusing as two of them look like twins. As they are involved in adulterous relations, we don't know who is with who. I suppose that is the point - we aren't supposed to really care about who it is. We are supposed to let ourselves go. Very well : there is a lot of beauty in this movie, from the close-up of a skinned chicken to a cliffside surrounded by deep jungle, from monsoon rains to a hip house where everything seems to be on the verge of crumbling into dust.

Hung tries so hard to avoid the war politics of Vietnam and gets bogged down on melodramatic mess. It is sad that Hung, respected by western critics, is in deep denial of Vietnam's colonial history. In Cyclo, he deals a little bit with the sociological aspects of Vietnam; unfortunately, he does not probe deep enough to be compelling.
  'Being compelling' perhaps is Hung's problem. The characters, particularly the three sisters, in this movie are flat, one-dimensional, and utterly unconvincing. Furthermore, they are exoticized, especially Hung's own star and real-life wife, who played the youngest sister. The plot is so thin and choppy. The pacing of this film is so erratically episodic and as slow as molasses.
  Hung focuses on so much so on the visual aesthetic that he completely abandons the storytelling aspect of the movie.",1049587200,5,946,5.006369426751593

Now I will be the first to admit that the indoor sets are elegantly filmed, masterful stills, and the street scenes and landscapes are also brilliantly depicted.  But the problem with this movie is that there are people in it, simpering, inane, ridiculous characters clumsily portrayed living dull and pointless lives.  The muscial score is equally insipid, particularly the often repeated droning of a mush-mouthed balladeer whining and droning in English about something or other.  I saw where recently the superb actor, Don Duong, was arrested for treason when he returned to Vietnam because he played in movies  such as ""We Were Soldiers,"" films the government of Vietnam considers anti-party.

Tran Nu Yn-Kh did a beautiful job in filming a visually and musically textured (like Pedro Almodovar's work) movie.  The only problem I had was that the story kind of fell short at the end.  The way it was told  and where the story worked reminded me a lot of Ingmar Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""Scenes from a Marriage."" The songs and music are compelling.  My only regret is my own ignorance of Vietnamese culture, because there has to be some layers to that movie that will lure me back to revisit its beauty and deeper meaning.

1202028,5,B00000F2AF,"After the cold and sharp as knife, but explosive  cyclo, the philosopher director returns with vertical ray of the sun. This time like the scent of green papaya, he uses a more laid back story with intense emotions. Film is mainly set in Hanoi the capital city, and tells the story of 3 sisters and their loved ones. Strange family relationships, marriages with hidden problems and secret lovers are issue of the film. This time director uses lots of dialogue to build up the stories unlike his last 2 movies. Thus we can zoom in to the characters deep thoughts without much effort. All these are made with minimal, simple, non pretentious but always brilliant ideas,making easy to understand the lives of the characters. He also uses the philosophic elements more economically this time unlike cyclo.
An interesting point is sex is always there , hiding but never shown directly to the viewer by the director . Vietnam is still one of those countries where issues like sex is taboo and traditional way of life is well preserved. Director chooses to show the things as they are in the country and tries to give the feeling that is shared by his characters. But interestingly, portrayal of flirtious acts of the sister and her brother in morning scenes are indeed set to confuse the viewer as showing how mixed emotions can be.
Most of the actors and actresses are from the last 2 Hung films so we are familiar with their capabilities. When it comes to cinephotography, Tran Anh Hung's films are very hard to beat. In door and out door scenes, lovely colours and well established shots are again the name of the game. Music choices are excellent and fits like a glove especially in morning scenes.
This movie may not be as beautiful as the scent or as explosive as cyclo. But Hung does his best to tell his not too strange story by not falling in to the trap of being  boring.
In sum another excellent addition to the director's career.
An excellent watch and an excellent film to own.",1023753600,10,1984,4.6335227272727275

7906645,5,B00000F2AF,"I have gone through two copies of this movie. For me it like a tranquilizing video. So well written, so well acted, yet not a big, dramatic plot or tension like most movies. Now

 This copy would just arrive!  It's late.",1397001600,,223,4.261904761904762
7906646,5,B00000F2AF,"This film is a cinematic masterpiece by an amazing French/Vietnamese director which shows an essence of Vietnam that foreigners would never imagine exists.  The plot is much more complex and modern than ""The Scent of Green Papaya"", which provides similar cinematic beauty.  The morning yoga scenes are striking and a bit shocking.  This film should be a ""must see"" for fans of foreign films.",1391817600,,391,5.078125

7906649,4,B00000F2AF,"The same person who told me about CLOUD 9 mentioned this film. I can see why, even though CLOUD 9 is in German and is focused on older lovers. The lush photography is akin.

I just wish there were more directors (both in the US and international) who would do this type of film for older viewers like myself.

Granted, I'm not too old to not catch the sensuality running throughout the story. I just wish there was more romance stories for my age.

Why don't you do a film like SEASONED ROMANCE and GRANDPA DOES GRANDMA books? The stories are incredibly sexy. Or is the world ready for that yet? Maybe 60-ish and 70-ish bodies in bed together is a turn-off for the younger set, but the scenes from CLOUD 9 and the books I mentioned were a real turn-on for me. And judging from comments I've read and sales, I don't think I'm alone.",1312156800,,831,4.314102564102564
