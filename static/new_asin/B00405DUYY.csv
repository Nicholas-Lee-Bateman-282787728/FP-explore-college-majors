I'm fortunate enough to live in an amazing place in Utah where I have access to so many incredible landscapes, including the Great Salt Lake and Bonneville Salt Flats. I've been out there on the GSL Salt Flat in all four seasons and experienced what Murray describes in this video, although he takes it to the extreme. I'm so glad all those trips paid off for you Murray, not just the amazing photos and this documentary, but the experience you passed through that changed your life. This disc is definitely worth 30 minutes of your life, buy it!",1372636800,,653,4.495798319327731
8412078,5,B00405DUYY,"a video that manages to take one on a journey into the connectedness of nature, time, and humans within this through sharing a personal journey into the wilderness on repeated visits over time at a site in Australia",1367971200,,215,4.684210526315789

Only criticism is that it could have been longer :)",1358467200,,136,4.48
8412080,4,B00405DUYY,"A photgraphic journey into the salt flats in northern Australia. The video is ~30min long and does a wonderful job or recording the scenic beauty in a very desolate place. This is an indie film with great vistas. The night sky, with little or no light pollution is wonderful - you see shooting stars and galaxies far far away. If you like remote places where the night sky comes alive this movie will make you long for them. It is a photographer's record of a place over a span of some 10 years. The blu-ray is worth getting because the landscape and stars just pop right out at you - the detail is incredible. I'd love to be able to afford some of the guys large format prints someday.",1295654400,3,686,4.325581395348837
8412081,5,B00405DUYY,"i saw this originally on pbs, then bought the blu-ray when it came out a couple weeks ago. interesting self told story from a photographer's perspective about his fascination with salt flats. he camps out for  period of time, and photographs the flats at the best light. he comes across as something of a strange person, but being a photographer/artist myself, i would ask have you ever met a photgrapher/artist who wasn't strange in some regard. i loved this blu-ray, it's too short at under an hour long, and i wish i could have spent more time with this person for three or four hours. worth the price anyway, as it has some pretty spectacular images to enjoy.",1289433600,6,663,4.61864406779661
