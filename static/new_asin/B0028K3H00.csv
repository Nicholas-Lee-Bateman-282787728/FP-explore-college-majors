8356324,3,B0028K3H00,"Not a bad mix of horror shorts. They all seemed to have a similar scare tactic but for the budget, I think the director did a good job.",1407628800,,135,3.857142857142857

8356326,4,B0028K3H00,"I didn't find ""Horror Theater"" to be very scary, but the stories are still told well and look great. A very entertaining watch. No regrets on the purchase.",1347148800,2,155,4.571428571428571
8356327,4,B0028K3H00,If you like being scared then this anthology of frights and shocks is just right for you. This collection was great! These wonderfully original stories satisfy that primal desire in all of us who like the thrill of terror. The story with the noises hidden inside the wall is my favorite. I can't wait to see what's next!,1255305600,2,320,4.5344827586206895
8356328,4,B0028K3H00,"I'm not a huge fan of Japanese style horror, which often has incoherent plot lines and hopelessly downer endings. However Hiroshi Katagiri gives his characters a chance to solve a few supernatural mysteries without being automatically screwed in the end. His slick and creative directing pries deeply into the emotional core of the characters, adding to the terror factor. Nice comedic cameo role in the DVD extras from award winning effects guru Alex Gillis (Wolverine, AVP 1 & 2).",1243296000,4,482,5.113924050632911
8356329,5,B0028K3H00,"Katagiri's direction is fresh in a time of cookie cutter horror.  his subtlety and grace is exactly what's missing from the genre right now, and precisely what must be re-instituted for horror to survive.  with so many mediocre big budget films being made by inexperienced directors, Katagiri delivers thoughtful stories with charm and personality instead of gore and goofy dialogue.  stories that, while classically rooted in Japanese horror, are reminiscent of the simplicity of western filmmaking in the 1960s. his camera moves are well thought out and build tension where dialogue and performance cannot, and the lighting is wonderfully dramatic.  The pacing is slow and ominous which lends itself to these tales of ghostly probings and inner turmoil.  this is a return to intelligent and substantial film making.  something the genre has sadly lost.  i loved experiencing this DVD, and i look forward to this filmmaker's future.",1242864000,3,933,5.3061224489795915
