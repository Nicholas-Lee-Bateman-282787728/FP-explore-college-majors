333208,5,6301491920,"This classic film noir, featuring the twin cleft-chinned presences of
Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, has got to be one of the most
enjoyable ever made.  It's not the somewhat confusing plot, but the
snappy dialogue -- and the confident acting -- which makes it work so
well.  The repartee (""A woman with a rod is like a man with a
knitting needle"") is worthy of some of the best screwball
comedies and yet it's just as dark as a noir should be in terms of the
desperate things the characters do and the terrible things that happen
to them as a consequence.  Jacques Tourneur (""Cat People"",
""I Walked With a Zombie"") directs with finesse, but the
importance of an ace writer like James M. Cain (""The Postman
Always Rings Twice"") -- uncredited for some reason -- can't be
stressed enough.  He deserves as much credit for the success of the
film as Tourneur, Mitchum, Douglas, and shapely femme fatale Jane
Greer, the woman who seduces both Mitchum and Douglas -- rod in hand.",909532800,71,975,4.586206896551724

333218,5,6301491920,"Out of the Past (1947) stars Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum- two actors who are up to the task in this classic film noir. This film has virtually every film noir attribute: a femme fatale, plot twists, crime, mischief, suspense, lots of smoking, and shadowy cinematography. In this film, the film noir aura slowly builds- it even gets progressively darker in asthetic and feel, which is pretty neat. It's sort of like dimming the lights in a room. The acting is superb, as Greer and Mitchum have chemistry, and a young Kirk Douglas does a fine job. Jane Greer is the ultimate femme fatale, with beauty, charm, but a very dark and corrupt side to her.  Out of the Past is essential to your film noir collection. The blu ray is an excellent restored print, and the sound is very good as well. There's only one special feature (a commentary), but I didn't mind.",1508630400,,857,4.564935064935065

333234,5,6301491920,"Many critics consider this 1947 black and white 121-minute film the best film noir ever produced. Whether this is true or not, it is true that ""Out of the Past"" is an engrossing film. Although Robert Mitchum was not the producer's first choice as the hero of the film - he preferred Humphrey Bogart or Dick Powel - virtually all agree Mitchum is superb, even mesmerizing, in this role.
While trying to hide out under an assumed name, the Mitchum character is drawn back to the events he is trying to forget. He was an honest private investigator who was hired by a gangster (Kirk Douglas) to find and bring back to him a beautiful woman (Jane Greer) who left him after shooting him, and stole $40,000 from him. Mitchum is promised a large fee, half paid in advance. He searches, finds her, and falls in love with her. She claims she never stole the money. She admits she shot him, but this was because she was carried away because she hates him. The two decide to run away together. Mitchums ex-partner as a PI finds them and Greer shoots him. The first of many indications that Greer should not be trusted. Mitchum soon discovers that she did steal the $40,000 and she returned to Douglas. It was then that Mitchum bought a gas station in a small town under an assumed name and started a relationship with a respectable local woman.
Douglas still furious that Mitchum did not bring Greer to him, forces Mitchum to come to him and take an assignment to get papers from an accountant who was blackmailing him; unless he pays the accountant a million dollars. He is told to deal with this mans secretary (Rhonda Fleming). Mitchum is sure that he is being set up by Douglas and Greer, that they intend to kill the accountant and frame him.",1502064000,,1736,4.514285714285714

A car drives into Bridgeport Calif and stops. The driver asks about the owner of Bailey's Garage. Joe Stefanos tells Jeff somebody wants to see him at Lake Tahoe. Jeff used to be a private detective in the Big City, he was asked to find a runaway girlfriend. He tracks Kathie Moffit to Acapulco Mexico and finds her. The film tells what happened there. Jeff falls in love with Kathie and they plan to leave. But Whit shows up with Joe. Jeff puts them off, then leaves with Kathie for San Francisco. But Jeff's old partner finds them. Kathie shows her hidden personality, and Jeff finds her bankbook! They separate.

When Jeff visits Whit he finds Kathie has returned. Whit wants Jeff to do a job for him in San Francisco. Jeff will retrieve the papers from a person (but worries if it is a frame). The plot grows more complex. Jeff senses the trap and foils the plot. But something happens to upset Bailey's scheme. Jeff manages to escape his pursuers and turn the tables. Will he be cleared of the frame and collect his payment? More complexities arise in a surprising ending. The ending is happy for the survivors.

DVD of it, now tonight, just watched the film at Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, on a nice
big screen, in all its 35mm glory.  What a total masterpiece.  Been a massive fan of Jacques Tourneur and
Val Lewton for years now, but somehow didn't know Out of the Past as well as I should have, now that's all
been rectified. Was a truly wonderful experience seeing this timeless classic with a good size audience,
on a huge screen, just fabulous.  This is a complex and sometimes frustrating screenplay, as even Robert
Mitchum apparently exclaimed at times during production, according to the notes provided with the screening
tonight, although really, it's not nearly as baffling/befuddling as the truly impenetrable (but wonderful) The Big Sleep.
I dunno if this is the best-ever noir, but it certainly should rate on anybody's Top 20 noir list. If you're at all a film noir
fan, you need to see this as soon as possible.  And this is easily one of Mitchum's finest tough-guy performances.

The subtle ways of this genre come up.  Mitchum's blond girlfriend played by Virginia Huston is always in white as the good girl, while Jane Greer, the bad girl, is almost always in dark clothes.  Greer and Kirk Douglas, in only his 2nd movie, really make this superb.  One can be a bit confused for a bit as the Rhona Fleming character somewhat resembles Greer, but that is about the only tiny fault I can find.

Greer, to me, plays the ultimate femme fatale of all time, even surpassing Barbara Stanwick in Double Indemnity.

Even the tiny parts, like the woman behind the counter in the diner, are superbly done.  Like most noir films, most of the scenes are shot at night.  This has both urban and rural settings.  San Francisco apartment scenes are especially good.  As in all movie made in this time, nobody gets away with their crimes, but this does not distract from the drama.

I heard many years later, as both lived a long life, Mitchum and Greer did a parody of their roles on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.  I would love to find that.",1441238400,,1192,4.462962962962963

333517,5,6301491920,"Anyone who had any doubts about the use of the Blu-ray format when it comes to old black and white films can put all those doubts away. Having just viewed Warner's new Blu-ray of Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past""(1947) I'm still overwhelmed by the absolute pristine video of this classic film noir now a part of Warner's Archive Collection. For those who might be concerned, this is ""not"" a DVD-R as are most of the titles in the WAC. Warner's has started to release some of it's classic films on Blu-ray through it's Archive Collection which have been previously released on standard DVD. That includes ""Out of the Past"" which was one of the five films in Volume One of it's ""Film Noir Classics Collection"" from ten years ago. But the difference between that DVD and this new Blu-ray is simply stunning. According to published reports, Warner's gave ""Out of the Past"" a very high bitrate(34.57) for this transfer and needless to say the results are astounding. It's simply beautiful. I don't know if the restoration team at Warner's had the original negative to work with but it sure looks like it. The cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca is not only enhanced on Blu-ray but probably hasn't looked this good since it's original theatrical run. The story is complicated(lots of twists and turns) but concerns a former private detective, played by Robert Mitchum(one of his best early performances) who is trying to live a quiet existence in order to break from his past life. However, other people have other ideas. That's all I'm going to say about the story. Jacques Tourneur's tight direction is heavy on mood development and it's those developments which makes this film one of the most stylish and interesting film noirs of all time. All this is brought to new life on Blu-ray with even the smallest details front and center. Blacks are very prominent, especially in the night scenes with shadows and lights never looking so good. Tourneur gives his actors lots of close-ups and this is really where the smallest details are evident. You can clearly  see the perfectly combed hair on Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas' heads. The costumes and sets are more prominent and even the famous cigarette smoke(there's a lot of smoking) becomes part of each scene and takes on a life of it's own. There are no vertical lines, white specks, torn frames, or any other damage to the picture itself which makes viewing the film all the more enjoyable. As good as Mitchum is in his part, the film really belongs to Jane Greer who gives one of the great femme fatale performances in film noir history as Kathy Moffat. It's right up there with Barbara Stanwyck's performance as Phyllis Dietrichson in ""Double Indemnity"" and viewers will be just as shocked by the ending. The audio(DTS-HD MA 2.0 Mono) has been improved also(you'll probably have to lower the volume on your remote) with dialogue and background noises being crystal clear. Location shots of Lake Tahoe, Mexico City and San Francisco are also sharp and clear. ""Out of the Past"" is 97 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1 and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special feature include a commentary by film noir historian James Ursini(Note: the Blu-ray disc itself is housed in one of those eco-cutout cases so you may want to switch to more solid & sturdy Blu-ray case for added protection). If you love film noir then Warner's new Blu-ray of ""Out of the Past"" is essential to any film library or collection. Hopefully we'll see more film noir titles from the Warner vaults in the future. ""Out of the Past"" comes very highly recommended.",1409097600,38,3599,4.842532467532467

333547,5,6301491920,"There isn't much that can be said about Jacques Tourneur's film that hasn't already been said before.  The plot is monstrously complicated, but really doesn't assume too much importance; what matters more is to savor the atmosphere created by Nicholas Musuraca's camera, as it tracks moodily round a series of dingy interiors that contrast starkly with the bright light of Jeff Bailey's (Robert Mitchum's) gas station.  In this world there are no such concepts as ""good"" and ""evil"": the characters are perpetually out to exploit one another.  Jeff might be considered the ""hero"" of the film, but his motives are often questionable - although he does not actually commit murder, he becomes involved in a series of plots initiated by Whit (Kirk Douglas), and subsequently tries to double-cross him.  Mitchum's performance is pure film noir - clad in dirty raincoat and battered hat, he is the epitome of cool, only becoming emotional when really necessary.  He has to work hard for our attention, however, particularly in the scenes with Kathie (Jane Greer), whose motives can never be trusted.  Alternately manipulative and winsome, she has the capacity to twist any man - Jeff included - round her little finger.  Her verbal tussles with Jeff are one of the film's highlights: whenever we think that Jeff has the measure of her, she eludes him.  In this kind of universe, ""good"" characters like Ann (Virginia Huston) have little chance of survival; despite the fact that her love for Jeff remains constant, she can never stay close to him.  The action of OUT OF THE PAST (BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH in the UK) starts slowly, but then builds to a compelling climax in which there are no winners.  For historians interested in post-1945 disillusion in the United States after the end of World War II, the film is a seminal text.",1401840000,2,1821,4.90228013029316

I'd just like to add that its high-voltage tension derives from a writer and a director who had strong backgrounds in horror films.  The screenwriter, Daniel Mainwaring (using alias Geoffrey Holmes for OUT OF THE PAST) adapted Jack Finney's above-average novel into the great 1955 Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, probably the best sci-fi/horror film ever made.  The director, Jacque Tourneur, helmed Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and other RKO ""art-horror"" flicks.  Plus Tourneur directed 1957 Night of the Demon, another winner.  It's possible that Mainwaring's and Tourneur's grounding in horror films helped them in learning how to put together a tight, well plotted and directed, film noir classic like Out of the Past.",1380672000,2,868,5.215827338129497

""Out of the past"" contains absolutely everything a ""film noir"" should have. There is a (former) private investigator (Robert Mitchum), cynical but not entirely depraved, bearing many scars on his body and soul, weary from carrying the weight of secrets of his somehow shadowy past. There is a ruthless, dangerous and very rich scoundrel, bad to the bone but brilliant, charismatic and in some (very dark) way even charming (Kirk Douglas). There is a woman so beautiful, intelligent and smoking hot that even the hardest men will melt when meeting her gaze (Jane Greer). And then there is a vixen so venomous and depraved (Rhonda Fleming) that it is hard to believe that this film was actually shown in theaters in 1947.

At 97 minutes it is not a very long film, but it is VERY full of events and the story is so well organized that I had the impression that it was longer - but just so we are clear, I was never bored and I adored every second of it. There was everything in it what one can ask from a ""film noir"": shady deals were made, people were double-crossed and then the double-crossers were triple-crossed, shots were fired, cops were called, shallow graves were dug, bodies were found (and sometimes lost again), women were kissed, hearts were broken, whisky was poured (a lot), cigarettes were smoked (even more), clever one liners were fired and smarting comebacks were shot in return, and above all there was a lot of sex - absolutely never shown but nevertheless present in almost every scene...

This film is a treasure, to buy, watch and keep for re-watching! I am absolutely keeping my DVD. Enjoy!",1358380800,2,1775,4.737864077669903
333641,4,6301491920,"I've said it before, but they don't make movies like this anymore. Gone are the days when movies centered around great stories and great actors. It wasn't about the visual effects but rather a meaty and addictive story. I'm not sure I have seen a Robert Mitchum film before so it was a delight to see him at his peak. I never thought of him as handsome but yes, he is in a definite manly way. Add in the absolutely gorgeous Jane Greer and Rhonda Flemming and the film has a character long lost to modern film. Director Jacques Tourneur obviously put his heart into the film. I have seen a number of Tourneur films from the 40's when he teamed with producer Val Lewton and directed several low budget horror films for RKO Studios. He moved on to other films and he created a film noir masterpiece.
Although OUT OF THE PAST follows the film noir genre, it also has a number of differences. Much of the film is set outdoors or often in well-lit interiors but there is the usual sprinkling of shadowy night scenes and dark interiors that helped give film noir its name.
In film noir, we always have a troubled man getting involved with the wrong sort of people. If you are in a film noir movie and a gorgeous ""dame"" walks in dripping in fur and jewels, you should know to run and run fast. Trouble and mayhem has just walked into your life. This time it is the lovely and mysterious Kathy Moffat (Jane Greer) who will be the downfall of  Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum). Bailey runs a service station in a quiet small town. He's in love with a local girl--the sweet Ann Miller(Virginia Huston). We know Ann is pure of heart with her lovely features but small town values.
Bailey's past catches up with him and he meets up again with mobster Whit Sterling (played by a young Kirk Douglas). Could there be a better cast? Here is where fate intervenes and Bailey's quiet life will never be the same. Moffat shot Sterling and she ran off with $40,000 of his money. Now we have the film noir detective mystery.
Who can be trusted as Bailey, Moffat and Sterling clash.
OUT OF THE PAST is stylish and classy. The dialogue is quick and crisp. The quick banter back and forth between characters is a classic in film noir. This was an era where censors ruled and much of the sexual banter is in subtle yet obvious words.
From here, you can follow the story to its conclusion and delight in the ride.
OUT OF THE PAST is a GEM OUT OF THE PAST. They just don't make movies like this.",1355270400,7,2463,4.366013071895424
333642,4,6301491920,"Robert Mitchum. That man possessed a sort of feral energy and charisma, a brutal sort of good-looks, a voice that said ""I don't give a damn what you think"", and a presence so large when he came onto your screen there was nothing you could do but stare, riveted. He smoked enough cigarettes in one day to kill a lesser man, and looked good doing it too.
As Roger Ebert said, ""He was the soul of film noir.""
Forget Bogart. Mitchum was the toughest dude in the '40's.

Then there is Kirk Douglas. A young man at the time - 30, and still not reached the fame he would later achieve. His role as Whit Sterling in Out of the Past is brilliant. The character's courteous, always-smiling exterior is strangely off-setting and menacing.

And Jane Greer is FABULOUS as the femme fatale Kathie Moffat, the basis for Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct.
....
Out of the Past, based on the novel (with a terrific title) Build My Gallows High, is as perfect a film noir as you will ever find.
It is a QUINTESSENTIAL film noir.
It contains everything that made them great:
the laconic, world-weary, gun-toting, cigarette-smoking, Private Eye tough guy,
the mysterious, seductive, sexy,  Femme Fatale,
the convoluted, non-linear storyline,
the gangster villain, suave, dangerous,
the dark cinematography, the hazes of cigarette smoke, the night-time scenes.

333645,5,6301491920,"Out of the Past is one of the finer examples of classic film noir out there. The story revolves around an antihero (former detective Bailey, played perfectly by Mitchum) who has grittiness, street smarts,  and a cool aloofness  (and also some secrets in his past). Bailey's story is filled with double crossing, seedy types, dangerous situations, and untrustworthy dames.

I want to say that Mitchum steals the show, but there are other great performances as well. Kirk Douglas is fantastic as the slick, conniving mobster Whit Sterling and Jane Greer does an exceptional job as lovely and dangerous Kathie.  And Mitchum, well, he takes coolness to a new level,; he has a cynicism that is unmatched, and isn't phased at anything thrown his way. As Bailey, he has some of the most memorable lines too (When confronting Kathie:  ""You're like the leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another."" ).

The film opens with Bailey being visited by one of Sterling's men. Bailey, who has retreated from his former ties and works at a gas station, knows that his game is up and he will have to confront Sterling. Bailey, trying to lead a respectable life with a romantic interest, girl-next-door type Ann. Bailey then tells Ann in the form of a flashback all the events that has led up to this encounter.
Sometimes the voice-over in a noir is hit and miss, but Mitchum really sets the mood perfectly with his cynical approach, especially in the scenes that takes him to Acapulco and a meeting with Kathie in the bar.

Out of the Past is a superb filmmaking, one that you can go back to again and again without it feeling old or tired. Excellent performances by the leads and fantastic noir atmosphere.

As a fan of many of the Val Lewton horror films of the early 1940's I was familiar with the directing skill of Jacques Tourneur.  He was in charge of films like ""Cat People"", ""The Leopard Man"" and ""I Walked with a Zombie.""  These films were not particularly scary but high on suspense and always well done given the budget.  In this classic film noir, Tourneur gives us a masterpiece.

Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum in his first big role) is a small town owner of a gas station.  He's a pleasant enough guy who is in love with the beautiful librarian-like Ann (Virginia Huston), the town's nice girl.  All is not as it seems however as an out-of-towner (Paul Valentine) pays Jeff a visit.  They clearly know each other.  Jeff is summonsed to Lake Tahoe, some 80 miles away, to meet with another old acquaintance.  Ann goes along for the ride and Jeff begins his story ""out of the past.""

At this point the film goes back in time for much of the remaining running time.  Jeff was a private detective in his previous life (different last name too) and did some work for a nefarious gambler named Whit Sterling (a young Kirk Douglas).  Sterling wants Jeff to find an ex-girlfriend (Jane Greer) who shot him and departed with 40,000 of his dollars.  He wants her back.  He doesn't care about the money he tells Jeff.  Jeff accepts the $10,000 payday even if he does all the work and has to split the money with his partner (Jack Fisher).  In some convoluted methodology, Jeff figures Kathie (Greer) has gone to Mexico.  Acapulco, specifically.  And wouldn't you know it, he's right!  Eventually, he finds her and falls hard.  She's beautiful, sexy and just a little mysterious.  She's also a double-crossing sycophant.

The couple decide to head to San Francisco and stay under the radar.  Unfortunately Brodie, Jeff's partner wants his $5000 and tracks down the couple at a mountain cabin.  They get into a fist-fight which Jeff is winning but Kathie pulls a gun and offs Brodie.  She then runs out on Jeff and the corpse.  Back to the present as Ann leaves Jeff at the Sterling estate overlooking Lake Tahoe.  To no one's real surprise, Kathie is back with Whit and Whit has another job for Jeff.  All seems to be forgiven, but is Kathie playing everyone again for her own financial gain?  What do you think?

This is perhaps the perfect example of film noir.  It has the down-on-his-luck and likely doomed hero, the beautiful women of dubious character (including a radiant Rhonda Fleming as another femme fatale) and some well written, snappy dialog.  Here are a few samples:  Whit:: ""Smoke a cigarette, Joe."" And ""Think of a number, Joe."" Listen to Joe tell Jeff how he found his gas station: ""It's a small world."" Jeff: ""Yeah. Or a big sign."" Kathie saying ""I hate him. I'm sorry he didn't die."" Jeff: ""Give him time."" Jeff's friend the cab driver, assigned to tail Meta Carson: ""I lost her."" Jeff: ""She's worth losing."" Jeff to Kathie: ""Just get out, will you? I have to sleep in this room."" Kathie to Jeff: ""You're no good, and neither am I. That's why we deserve each other."" And in the movie's most famous exchange, Kathie telling him, ""I don't want to die."" Jeff: ""Neither do I, baby, but if I have to, I'm going to die last.""  Perfect.",1329782400,,3257,4.58578856152513

333669,4,6301491920,"Following World War 2, the taste of the moving-going public changed dramatically and the next decade saw a parade of down beat films collectively called ""film noir"". The name came from the French who were denied US films during the war, and  when audiences watched films like ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Woman in the Window"" (1944), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944) and ""Double Indemnity"" (1945), they coined the term ""film noir"" to refer to films that highlighted the seamy side of life and carried a cynical message.

Film noir had its roots in German expressionism in the silent era and films like ""The Blue Angel"" (1929) and ""M"" (1931) as well as American gangster films like ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1931) and ""Scarface"" (1932).

The 40s were the peak for classic film noir, and this is one of the better ones, with some of the best film noir actors around - Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas - and some of the best film noir creators - Jacques Tourneur (director), Nicholas Musuraca (camera) and Roy Webb (music).

The film is also known as ""Build my Gallows High"" which is the name of the Geoff Homes (1902-77) novel on which the film is based. Homes also wrote ""The Phenix City Story"" (1954) and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956) among his 60+ titles.

* ""Don't you see you've only me to make deals with now?  - Greer
* ""Build my gallows high, baby."" - Mitchum

Robert Mitchum (1917-97) was one of the kings of film noir (""When Strangers Marry"", ""Undercurrent"", ""The Locket"", ""Pursued"", ""Crossfire""). He received his only Oscar nomination for ""The Story of GI Joe"" (1945), but movie fans know that Mitchum was a terrific actor who deserved far more acknowledgement, but his ""bad boy"" persona undoubtedly interfered. Mitchum's work in films like ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and ""Cape Fear"" (1962) is ranked by AFI as among the top 100 villains of all time. Mitchum plays a former big city detective trying to make a new life in a small town.

* ""Maybe love is like luck: you have to go all the way to find it."" - Mitchum

In only his second film, Kirk Douglas (1916) plays a well heeled gangster with a grudge against Mitchum. He would be Oscar nominated 3 times (""Champion"" in 1949, ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" in 1952, and ""Lust for Life"" in 1957) and won the Golden Glove for ""Lust for Life"". His memorable roles include ""Young Man with a Horn"" (1950), ""Paths of Glory"" (1957),  ""The Vikings"" (1958), ""Spartacus"" (1960) and ""Seven Days in May"" (1964) He appears as #17 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.

* ""My feelings? About ten years ago, I hid them somewhere and haven't been able to find them."" - Douglas

FWIW - Douglas went on to make several film noir movies  - ""I Walk Alone"" (1948), ""Champion"" (1949) and  ""The Big Carnival"" (1951) - but transitioned to mainstream roles. Mitchum became a staple in film noir over his entire career - ""The Big Steal"" (1948), ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955), ""Cape Fear"" (1962), ""Farewell My Lovely"" (1975).

Sexy Rhonda Fleming (1923) appeared in 40+ films in the 40s and 50s and was nicknamed ""The Queen of Technicolor"" for her flaming red hair in films like ""Serpent of the Nile"" (1953), ""Queen of Babylon"" (1955), and ""The Big Circus"" (1959). She has a small role in this film as a woman who tries to betray Mitchum.

*""They say the day you die your name is written in the clouds."" - Fleming

Cute 22 year old Jane Greer (1924-2001) was one of the queens of film noir, featured in the excellent book ""Dark City Dames"" by Eddie Muller. She plays the femme fatale who moves from Douglas to Mitchum and back again.

* ""That's not the way to win."" - Mitchum
* ""Is there a way to win?"" - Greer
* ""There's a way to lose more slowly."" - Mitchum

FWIW - When they re-made this film in 1984 (""Against All Odds"") Greer played the mother of her character in this film.

Director Jacques Tourneur (1904-77) is best known for his work on films with Val Lewton  like ""Cat People"" (1942), ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1942), and ""The Leopard Man"" (1943). In the 50s he transitioned to TV. Along with Berlin Express"" (1948), ""Out of the Past"" is one of his best film noir creations.

* ""She can't be all bad. No one is."" - Virginia Huston
* ""Well, she comes the closest."" - Mitchum

Nicholas Musuraca (1892-1975) is the cinematographer.  Musuraca was a master of the film noir visuals - ""Stranger on the 3rd Floor"" (1940), ""Cat People"" (1942). Musuraca was another Lewton graduate and worked with Mitchum on several films (""Blood on the Moon""). Ironically he received an Oscar nomination for his work on ""I Remember Mama"" (1948). This is not one of his best films, but he does a great job with the natural light and the dark settings.

FWIW - this was the final pairing of Tourneur and Musuraca.

The musical score from Roy Webb (1888-1982) is excellent, a great example of how music can supplement the story without imposing. Webb is best known from his work with Val Lewton, though he worked on more than 200 films and was nominated for an Oscar 6 times between 1938 and 1946.

1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" and the box office leaders included ""Unconquered"", ""The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer"", ""Mother Wore Tights"" and ""Life with Father."" Other notable films that year were ""Dark Passage"" (Bogart), ""The Lady From Shanghai"" (Orson Welles), and ""Possessed"" (Joan Crawford).

Bosley Crowther of the NY Times couldn't follow the plot. but nonetheless said ""it's very snappy and quite intriguingly played by a cast that has been well and smartly directed."" He said Mitchum ""is magnificently cheeky and self-assured"", Greer ""is very sleek"", and Douglas ""is crisp as a big crook."" Variety praised the ""topnotch lensing"" and Time magazine said that Greer was ""a hot number.""

FWIW - When asked about the labored plot, Mitchum joked that he thought they lost 3 pages somewhere. Greer confirmed this and said that a lot of the voice over by Mitchum was to cover the missing material.

* ""I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know anything except how much I hated him. But I didn't take anything. I didn't, Jeff. Don't you believe me?"" - Greer
* ""Baby, I don't care."" - Mitchum

The film is a very good example of film noir, but does have its problems. Act 3 is particularly ponderous with lots of excess baggage that slows the film down considerably and all kinds of subplots that take up time but add nothing to the story. The tagged on happy ending clearly reduces the impact of the film, but Hollywood producers often did this (e.g., ""The Lady in the Window"").

Some of my favorite film noir include: ""The Killers"" (1946), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""The Set Up"" (1949), ""DOA"" (1950),""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946), ""This Run for Hire"" (1942), ""They Live By Night"" (1949), ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950), ""Kiss me Deadly"" (1955), ""Scarlett Street"" (1945), and ""Brute Force"" (1947).

333671,5,6301491920,"This is one of my favorite film noirs.  Not only did Mitchum achieve stardom through it, but there is the wonderfully ambiguous Jane Greer and a sleazy murderous Kirk Douglas.  Their on-screen chemistry is unmatched in the genre.  I will attempt to describe its attractions without playing spoiler.

Mitchum is a guy hiding form his past, trying to start a new life in an isolated small town, where he has met a wonderful local girl who loves him.  His partner, a sensitive deaf mute, watches out for him, though their relationship is never explained.  Suddenly, he is approached by a charming yet menacing man, who orders him to meet his boss, Douglas.  Mitchum explains what is happening to his young fiancee on the way to the meeting.  He had fallen for a woman in the past, whom Douglas had hired him to find. Douglas felt he owned her, even though she shot him.  Mitchum is seduced by her and they try to run to start a new life.  Once found, Mitchum is shocked at what he thinks is the true nature of this woman and tries to disappear.  Needless to say, Douglas involves him in a complicated caper, bringing him back together with Greer, whose motives are forever suspect.  Mitchum smells a rat and tries desperately to survive.

The fun thing is that the viewer is trying to understand the nature of all the characters and sees only pieces.  It is very difficult to know what is going on, what they really want to do, and what they are capable of.  I was guessing and thinking the whole time, while also wowed by Greer's beauty and the cold intelligence of Mitchum.  I am sure I will be able to watch this many times and see more each time.

Warmly recommended.",1294790400,2,1668,4.506666666666667

It's a true tale of cross and double cross.  Good deal of tension building in this story with tight plotting and snappy dialog.  One of the best parts was by film critic James Ursini who talks about film noir as well as some interesting tidbits that viewers might have missed.  The action by the mute boy at the end, well, I didn't see that so it was a good catch.  Note that this movie was later remade into AGAINST ALL ODDS (following a somewhat similar tale) and Jane Greer played the mother of the new female lead.

333675,3,6301491920,"Having read so many reviews praising the movie it was a natural choice for me as I love film noir. Though I was kind of let down by the overall lack of atmosphere the film does have a substantial plot and plenty of sharp dialogue.

Robert Mitchum plays a private snoop hired to find the moll of a gangster after she flees to Mexico with a stash of his dough. He finds her alright, but they fall in love, and try, and fail, to begin anew by themselves.

Told partly in retrospect the film plays with its timeline creatively and adds a touch of sophistication to what would otherwise be a straight-forward narrative. Mitchum emotes very little as the sly gumshoe while Kirk Douglas plays the villain with a pleasant air of cheerfulness.

But what disappointed me is the absence of darkness. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of alleyways, gusts of wind, lightning flashes and shadows...but just not enough. I was left with no lasting images in my head, which is a big reason why I am a fan of the genre. Too many scenes were set in bright daylight with wide open spaces. Such locations just don't work in Noir, in my opinion.

Still, Out of the Past (known as Build my Gallows High in the UK) is worth a watch.",1285977600,6,1211,4.392857142857143
333676,5,6301491920,"Film Noir is tough to define.  James Ursini's commentary for Out of the Past is a perfect crash course.  You may have read much of this information before, but to have it paired with pertinent scenes from the film vividly illustrates the points he makes.

333677,5,6301491920,"Humphrey Bogart could have starred in OUT OF THE PAST.  He wanted to do so, but Warner wouldn't loan him out to RKO.  John Garfield and Dick Powell turned the part down.  So in stepped Robert Mitchum: his first starring role.  And he gave a performance that instantly made him RKO's number one male star.  Also memorable was the performance of Jane Greer; now widely regarded as one of the best femme fatales of all-time.  Interestingly, her coy smile is the result of a battle with Bell's palsy in her youth.  Lastly, Kirk Douglas capitalized on a very small role.  The impact he made is especially notable, given his role isn't much larger than a cameo.

But the real star here is director Jacques Tourneur, because the ""look"" of the film is perhaps it's greatest asset.  In my opinion, it is reminiscent of his work for producer Val Lewton.  Here, in combination with veteran noir cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca and noir art directors Albert S. D'Agostino and Jack Okey, Tourneur created perhaps the most consistently beautiful Hollywood noir film.

In addition, the visuals are supported by some very able screenwriting.  Novelist, Daniel Mainwaring adapted his own original work, which was then edited by James M. Cain and Frank Fenton, both uncredited.

A superior noir film, and a favourite of many noir aficionados.  If you are a film noir fan, don't miss this one!

333696,5,6301491920,"Just watched this movie for the umpteenth time -- a masterpiece -- but for the first time I listened to the commentary by James Ursini, who is a BORE -- who asked him?

There is something very mysterious about the film.  I think it is about the appearance of control, and how it slips away. It may be that this is one of the first movies I can think of where no one is really in control.  The men appear to be in control, but are constantly being messed up by Kathy. Kathy is the other potential person who could be in control, and there are moments when it appears she is in charge, but then she lets her desires take over. Kathy is constantly almost in control of her situation, like everyone else:  she is a classic femme fatale,  except that unlike the femme fatale she keeps losing her grip.  It's her on-again, off-again ruthlessness that makes her so fascinating.  The classic moment occurs when she watches the fight between the two detectives and suddenly turns into animal desire (the director also did The Cat People);  and loses her way, fatally, except that she appears to know what she is doing: it is necessary.  So what she is doing makes sense for a moment, but then slips further down river.  All the way through,  there are clusters of things that make sense in that moment, but they then set things up for the next mess. The movie slips back and forth like that.  There are classic setups, which in other movies give you the feeling that, ok, now we know who's making things happen, but here that expectation keeps losing its way.  The whole thing veers.  The plot(s) make a kind of sense, and then they slip too.  And everyone is slipping towards death.  Entropy at work.",1266192000,2,1692,4.444805194805195

Dialoge right out of those drug store pulp fiction novels, a movie that relies on plot, intreigue and innuendo rather than special effects. The script writers got it just right and the actors deliver the lines perfectly. Even if you can see the plot or twists, it is still fun to watch how well the actors pull it off.

This is such a classic, new film buffs and those who grew up with B&W movies will all appreciate this movie.

It's really hard to find a better film of this genre, even if you look to the more notable films of dark ilk like the ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""Chinatown"".  Robert Mitchum is excellent as the still idealistic PI who is hired for his honesty to find a mobster's girl.  The mobster (Kirk Douglas) just wants the girl back, forget the 40 grand she took as she left.  It doesn't make a lot of sense until you see our drop-dead gorgeous femme fatale (Jane Greer).  Now you know why the mobster is willing to forget the money and hire someone outside his gangster buddies to find her.  From that point, we fall into a whirlpool of intrigue, lust, betrayal and....oh yes, murder.

333700,5,6301491920,"Out of the Past is classic film-noir. Why this film hasn't garnered more acclaim & fame I don't know. It's not quite an essential film but it's as close as a film can be to that distinction without garnering that claim. Jacques Tourneur, the director, helped to create the film-noir genre with this film.

Robert Mitchum portrays Jeff Bailey, an ex-private eye. He's now a gas station owner that's hiding from his past. This was Mitchum's first starring role that gave him top billing. He had already appeared in over 30 films in just four short years. Many of these films he was barely noticeable & hadn't gotten great reviews as an actor. Out of the Past would change his whole future as a leading man.

In contrast, Kirk Douglas (Whit Sterling), was only appearing in his third film. Douglas was already making ripples & would reach star status in a shorter journey than Mitchum.

Jane Greer (Kathie Moffett) was only appearing in her eighth film & would never have a role this good in her short career.

As in most films in the film-noir genre there's not really a good guy. The only way you can call Bailey the good guy is to compare him to Kathie & Whit, in this context Bailey IS the good guy. Bailey is trying to escape his past but circumstances prevent this. Joe Stefanos (Paul Valentine) has, by accident, discovered the whereabouts of Bailey. Stefanos is a henchman for Whit who has an old score to settle with Bailey. In flashback we learn that Sterling had once hired Bailey to find Kathie who was Sterling's girl & had stolen $40,000 in cash from him. Bailey finds her in Acapulco but instead of returning her he falls for her. If ever there was a black widow Kathie is it; not only did she steal $40,000 but she had shot Sterling. Kathie denies she took the money but Bailey later finds a bankbook with a $40,000 deposit.

When Sterling shows up in Acapulco Bailey denies ever finding Kathie. He has double-crossed Sterling wanting to keep her for himself. Not only that but he has crossed his P.I. partner on the money payed by Sterling. All this comes back to haunt him a few short years later. Sterling wants to see Bailey & hire him again to fix something for him. Bailey goes to Lake Tahoe reluctantly knowing that no good is going to come of it.

Sterling has a tax problem that comes to seven figures. He wants Bailey to get the papers from a lawyer, Lloyd Eels (Ken Niles). Smelling a rat, Bailey questions the motives of Sterling & why he can't do it himself. Then, suddenly, Kathie reenters the picture & is once again the girlfriend of Sterling. Bailey now has to face up to the fact that Sterling knows that he had crossed him years before.

Out of the Past is full of witty dialog & innuendos. Bailey knows he's in a frameup but he feels obligated to correct the past. The problem is he's really not much better than Sterling or Kathie. The film is full of plot twists & duplicity. Not the most complicated of films yet the viewer has to pay full attention to keep up with everything. In the end everyone has to pay for their lack of virtues.

The film is in good shape as is the audio. There are subtitles & a bonus audio track that's a commentary on the film. Out of the Past is one of the best examples of film-noir & should not be missed.",1238371200,2,3271,4.421926910299003

Snappy dialog, wonderful use of shadows and incredible cinematography push this film into the upper echelon of must-see noir films.  The plot is convoluted but Mitchum and Greer have enough incendiary chemistry to keep things interesting.  For the record, the line is:  A dame with a rod is like a guy with a knitting needle.

Great use of locations in the Sierra Nevada.  Bonus seeing a smoldering Rhonda Fleming as Meta Carson.  Virginia Huston, Mitchum's goody girlfriend, is so milquetoast one can see why Robert Mitchum would be hot for Greer.  She never looked better.",1237248000,2,824,4.780141843971631
333702,4,6301491920,"""Out of the Past"" has all the biggies: money, murder, double crossing and then the inevitable revenge, and especially the femme fatale.  The plot is tight and interesting but a little opaque at times.  Essentially you see the plot through Mitchum's character, so things that aren't all that clear to him aren't all that clear to you, though the overall plot line hangs together well if you give the movie the benefit of the doubt on the characters' motivations.

The movie is also well acted, though that's easier when portraying strong guys who don't show much emotion, as all of the main male characters do (or don't).  Mitchum's dry delivery serves him well and Douglas is all smiles and sociopathy as the gambler/nemesis. Douglas' gunsel is also well played: the quintessential second banana smart enough to get away with murder but who knows deep down, he's not smart enough to be #1. The femme fatale is a tougher role and Greer does well, though her motivations are never really clear: she's an odd mix of sentiment and sociopath, an independent risk taker and co-dependent victim.

The film is very noir, as a good film noir should be.  All of the main characters screw up mightily and (SPOILER) in the end they all die for their mistakes.  Even in the final shot of the movie the last great gesture is a hurtful lie told for a greater good. A perfect movie? No, but a good one both as a stand-alone flick and as an important milestone in film noir development.

Watching this classic and classy movie again I feel both humor and black humor as intended, noir, as the French termed it.  Also, watching Mitchum being treated as a pin ball in a machine, soon makes you want to distrust everyone else in the picture, while looking for the frame too.

It was a difficult movie to be in as almost everyone of note ends up dead and only the two people you would least suspect are the only ones having a shot, no pun intended, at a happy ending.

This is truly a magnificent motion picture that will linger with the viewer, one to be watched again and again. I think I first saw the movie on TV in glorius black and white and not a thing has changed over the years.

If you like Mitchum, Greer, and Douglas this is a film for you. Though most of these folks are now dead they have left us a terrific picture from those far gone days.

333716,4,6301491920,"""Out of the Past,"" a 1947 RKO release directed by Jacques Tourneur of ""Cat People"" fame, is frequently hailed as the definitive ""film noir"" by critics, historians, and other ""experts."" I disagree, although I do find it an excellent film overall. Sure, it stars Robert Mitchum, who, in Roger Ebert's opinion, ""embodies the soul of film noir,"" and he wears a trenchcoat throughout no matter the weather. But from the very first frame, I found it a little short on the atmosphere - the fog and shadows, the rain swept streets, the blinking neon lights - that are the genre's visual style, and the visual style defines film noir more than the dialogue (tough, terse, fatalistic), or the characters (cynical double-crossers or those who become cynical after being double-crossed).

Daylight dominates the early scenes as Mitchum, a former private eye now operating a gas station, is called back to his old profession by Kirk Douglas. Yep, there's a woman involved. There's always a woman involved in noir, this one played by Jane Greer who would join Richard Widmark, another member of the noir hall of fame, in providing support for Jeff Bridges, James Woods, and Rachel Ward in the 1984 remake, ""Against All Odds.""

Things pick up halfway through as the double-crossing begins in earnest, but though ""Out of the Past"" has much to recommend it, it is not the best example of this fascinating genre. Try Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" or Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep."" Jules Dassin's ""Night and the City"" is another highlight, as is Lewis Milestone's ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" and Anatole Litvak's ""Sorry, Wrong Number."" For more modern attempts at revisiting the genre, you could do no better than Dick Richards' ""Farewell, My Lovely"" with Mitchum a superb Philip Marlowe.

333720,5,6301491920,"Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past"" perfectly defines the genre of film noir, with its morally compromised characters, underworld setting and general air of impending doom. I agree with an earlier reviewer that ""Out of the Past"" is second only to ""Double Indemnity"" among film noirs; I would add merely that ""Out of the Past"" exceeds ""Double Indemnity"" in its sheer fatalism, simply because Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) seems so much less deserving of his fate than ""Double Indemnity's"" Walter Neff. Played with sleepy-eyed, world-weary intensity by Mitchum, the essentially decent Bailey is made to pay over and over for the mistake of falling for Kathie Moffett (Jane Greer), the most treacherous of all femmes fatales, making ""Indemnity's"" Phyllis Dietrichson look like Pollyanna by comparison. ""Nobody's all bad,"" says Jeff's new love of Kathie. ""She comes closest,"" Bailey answers, and ""Out of the Past"" gives us ample proof of that observation. My only complaint about ""Out of the Past"" is with the ending, involving what the deaf boy (Dickie Moore) tells Bailey's new love (Virginia Huston). Obviously it was intended to be a fatalistic act of nobility (and probably played that way in 1947), but now it seems like a particularly rancid piece of Hays Code-era morality. Otherwise, with its smoky intensity and fine performances (particularly by Kirk Douglas as a gleefully vengeful mobster), ""Out of the Past"" is a brilliant example of film noir, one that repays repeated viewings.",1187654400,3,1489,5.208333333333333
333721,5,6301491920,"No question I am a film noir, especially a crime noir aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various crime noir efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and usually need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, femme fatale to muddy the waters also get a pass. Some, such as the film under review from 1947, Out Of The Past, get a double pass for the plot and for the femme fatale. And what a femme fatale.

A little summary of the plot line is in order to make my point. A young Robert Mitchum plays a not too choosey, just south of the shady-side but street smart, well street smart for a while, detective Jeff Markham (along with his gumshoe partner Fisher who enters into the scheme of things just a little, just like Miles Archer in The Maltese Falcon ) hired by mobster Whit (played by a young Kirk Douglas) to find his mistress, Kathy, (enter drop-dead beautiful Jane Greer) after she off-handedly shots him (and takes his dough, a lot of dough, although the amount to him is not the issue it is the fact of the taking that hurts his pride, hurts his pride big time). That mix, that flammable mix, of a malleable gumshoe, a touchy mobster, and drop-dead femme fatale who has the morals of an alley cat, maybe fewer, is what drives this one, especially the doings of that femme fatale. Well, a girl has to take care of herself in this wicked old world and the boys, well, the boys, can figure the angles for themselves, if they can ever think straight for a minute when she is within fifty yards of them.

Now no question if one had to think, and not think hard, of a 1940s movie star to play a detective who had to get his hands dirty, had to move his heft around, and take a few punches, if necessary, Robert Mitchum (along with Humphrey Bogart) would head the list. But he is strictly in over his head here, like all guys when it comes to tackling a dame. So naturally Jeff, while off-handedly chasing Kathy around Mexico on Whit's dime, falls, falls hard for Kathy. Once he smells the perfume, eyes her shape, well let's call a thing by its right name, once she gets under his skin he is a goner. And nobody could blame him really, life is short and how many times are you going to get a chance at a drop-dead beauty that, for the minute, is on the loose. Not me.

The problem is that Whit has his own sense of honor, or revenge, take your pick. And the fact of the matter is that Kathy has her tentacles into him as well, whatever mischief she may have done, whatever off-hand shot he might have to take when she is within fifty yards. So Whit will move might and main to get Kathy back, no questions asked, no quarter given. And Jeff, poor sap Jeff, will wind up behind the eight- ball. See, after another off-hand shooting by Kathy (this should have warned the boys off, a dame with a quick trigger finger should be given a wide berth, but what are you going to do when that perfume smell starts coming your way. Besides it's a dangerous world anyway), this time fatal, against Jeff's old detective partner Fisher who was now in the employ of Whit, Kathy winds up back under Whit's wing.

Whit, with Kathy back in tow and no stranger to intrigue, plots to frame Jeff, plots hard, and frames him big time, while getting out from under some blackmail from an accountant that has the goods on him. That frame drives the last half of the movie, but what really drives the thing is the now ""reformed"" Jeff's lingering taste for wildcat Kathy, although he has another honey, a non femme fatale honey, Ann, waiting for him in the wings. So like a moth to the flame when Kathy beckons Jeff is half-way there already.

And, no question, under ordinary circumstances, Jeff would have been able to get out from under but as he said in the course of trying to get out from under Kathy had ""built those gallows high."" So the lesson is clear, stay clear of femme fatales, especially wicked ones. Unless of course you think you are smart enough to keep up with them. If you think so though, build those gallows high, brother, build them high. See this beauty, see it several times, I have.",1185235200,5,4333,4.377639751552795

He has taken up with a local ""good girl"", Ann, who has obviously fallen in love with him. But he left his last job unfinished.

333737,5,6301491920,"This 1947 film is a fascinating study of human psychology as two men become fatally involved with a femme fatale. Robert Mitchum plays the central character, a man attempting to leave behind a shady past, who is drawn back into it. Kirk Douglas is his antagonist, a crook who has a way of falling for women ready to shoot him full of holes for a stack of his cash. Jane Greer is the smoldering but cool-headed woman who plays off each man against the other.

Partly shot on location in the small town of Bridgeport in the California Sierras, there are many sunlit scenes full of local-color detail to contrast with the shadow world of night-time San Francisco where much of the skullduggery takes place. Meanwhile, Lake Tahoe provides a mid-way location, where the grinning face of crime takes a holiday in well-furnished surroundings.

The plot is complex and full of unexpected often puzzling developments, and all the principals are fun to watch as they play their generic film noir characters for all they're worth, uttering classic lines like ""You're a leaf blown from gutter to gutter."" Rhonda Fleming has a turn in a minor role, and there is the curious presence of a young deaf man with a lethal fishing rod. Meanwhile, everyone smokes so much you'd be willing to bet that Big Tobacco owned RKO.

The DVD has an informative scene-by-scene commentary that identifies the classic elements of film noir, its place in Hollywood history, and the shifting nuances of appearance and reality in a story so rich in ambiguity that it's almost impossible to guess the motivations of the characters.

333738,5,6301491920,"Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, Night of the Demon), Out of the Past (1947) stars Robert Mitchum (The Night of the Hunter, The Enemy Below, Cape Fear), Jane Greer (The Prisoner of Zenda, Man of a Thousand Faces), and Kirk Douglas (20000 Leagues Under the Sea, Spartacus).  Also appearing is Rhonda Fleming (Spellbound, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral), Virginia Huston (Flight to Mars), Paul Valentine (House of Strangers), and Dickie Moore (Sergeant York, Miss Annie Rooney), a child actor who, by the time he was ten years old, had appeared in over fifty films, which is about fifty more than I've appeared in, and I'm a heck of a lot older than ten.

Robert Mitchum plays Jeff Bailey, an ex-big city private eye once known by the name Jeff Markham, who now owns and operates a rinky dink filling station somewhere between L.A. and New York (closer to L.A. in a flyspeck known as Bridgeport), his only employee a deaf-mute boy known only as `The Kid', played by Moore.  So how is it Mitchum's character ended up a gas jockey out in the middle of nowhere?  Well, if you guessed it had something to do with a woman, you'd be right...and not just any woman, you see, but a real doozy of a tomato who goes by the name Kathie Moffat (Greer).  You see, in a previous life Jeff was hired by a wealthy man named Whit Sterling (Douglas) to run down Whit's girlfriend Kathie, who had skipped town after stealing a whole mess of Whit's dough and throwing a few slugs his way (sounds like a complicated relationship).  Anyway, Jeff tracks Kathie down old Mexico way, and promptly falls for her but hard.  Jeff Tells Whit Kathie got away, following which Jeff and Kathie pull a Houdini and vanish, heading north and losing themselves in the hustle of the streets of San Francisco, but after awhile an old acquaintance of Jeff's makes the scene and threatens their anonymity.  Some bad things happen, Kathie splits (she makes a beeline back to Whit), and Jeff tries to start anew, leaving the past behind, that is until Whit finds Jeff and hires him for another job, one involving the recovery of some papers from a blackmailer (seems not all of Whit's business activities are on the up and up)...all right, maybe `hired' isn't the right term, as Whit more or less pushed the job onto Jeff, who soon learns the case is much more than it seems as Whit intends to accomplish a number of things, including the recovery of incriminating documents, getting the blackmailer off his back, and last but not least getting even with Jeff by framing him for a crime he didn't commit (I'll give you a hint, it starts with `M' and ends with `R' and rhymes with girder).

While this isn't my favorite Robert Mitchum film (that's a toss up between The Night of the Hunter and Thunder Road), at least of the ones I've seen, it does rank up there in his top five.  I really liked Mitchum's portrayal here as he's a fairly hard case sort with street smarts to spare, but not so hardboiled and cynical as to deny himself a shot at love, even if it means falling for another man's woman while hired by said man to find her and bring her back.  Okay, maybe not the smartest play in the book, but who can argue with their heart?  That's one battle you'll rarely ever win...while I could identify with Mitchum's character somewhat Greer's character was different story.  She was definitely bad news, but was it because she was just a sweet, beautiful woman caught in a rotten situation or because she was a conniving, manipulative seductress, always dialed in to making things work for herself?  It was difficult trying to pin Kathie down, as she came off as someone you'd want to believe and trust (if you were a man), yet her actions, especially when in a tight spot, would make you feel otherwise.  And no matter how dicey the situation, she always managed to turn, twist, and tangle things in her favor, presenting one of the more slippery characters I've seen in long while.  There are a number of great scenes with some truly wonderful dialog, some memorable lines including the following...

In this scene Jeff comes clean to his current girlfriend Ann, played by Virginia Huston, about his past, including how things ended with Kathie...

Ann Miller:  She can't be all bad. No one is.

Jeff Bailey:  Well, she comes the closest.

And here's another, after Jeff finds out from Kathie (through a little arm twisting), what Whit's game is...

Kathie Moffett:  Oh, Jeff, I don't want to die!

Jeff Bailey:  Neither do I, baby, but if I have to I'm going to be the one who dies last.

As far as the direction by Jacques Tourneur, I thought it very stylish, moody, and highly appropriate for the material.  While the story did get complicated, I found it pretty easy to follow, a lot of that having to do with the way the story was laid out and populated by interesting characters (of course, having Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming to look at regularly didn't hurt).  The one element in this film I didn't care much for was the bit tacked on after the `real' ending of the film.  I would have rather the movie ended a few minutes sooner and having forgone the unnecessary sequence between Ann and `The Kid'.  I'm sure this was something the studio requested i.e. insisted be included for the purpose of providing closure most likely, but it sort of works against the `noir' sensibilities inherent in the rest of the film, at least in my opinion.  Other than that this is a wonderful film, one worth watching more than once.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks very clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes across well. As far as extras, included is a commentary track with author/film-noir specialist James Ursini and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French. If you're interested in picking up this DVD, you might want to look into purchasing the Film Noir Classics Collection, Volume 1, a most excellent DVD set, as it includes this film, along with Gun Crazy (1949) aka Deadly Is the Female, The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Murder, My Sweet (1944), and The Set-Up (1949) which appears to cost significantly less than buying the films individually.

But Douglas has his number and forces him to pull another job: stealing records that implicate him in tax evasion. The plot thickens, as they say, and before it's over there's more double-crossing and murder involving all the principals, who all get what they deserve by the end. It's considered a film noir classic because of the complicated plot developments, the unsavory characters (especially Greer and Douglas), the fatalistic outlook, and the atmospheric photography (lots of night scenes and shadowy overtones). Mitchum is perfect in his role, with those droopy eyes and the cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and this picture made him a star.

It exhibits several aspects of noir: the lighting is amazing and stark, the characters are all corrupt in some way, and there is a femme fatal involved. The story is about Jeff (Robert Mitchum), a man trying to escape his dark past to marry the woman he loves. However, it comes back to get him in the form of a mob boss (Kirk Douglas) who he crossed by romancing his beautiful girlfriend (Jane Greer). Jeff is to become framed for two murders in order to secure the boss' freedom; he has failed to pay taxes on his corrupt income and is in jeopardy of being found out.

The film is very dark, but it is highly enjoyable. The characters are interesting and they have depth. The love affairs are not perfect the way they are often shown in films; the romances have twists and turns just like in real life.

Supplementing the brilliant cast is former child star Dickie Moore in the role as a deaf boy. Now in his twenties, Moore is very attractive and exciting to see. His part is far too small in this film.

The storyline of this movie revolves around a rural gas station owner in Nevada named Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum).  Bailey is dating a sweet and innocent girl named a Meta Carson (Jane Greer).  One day a man comes to town looking  for Bailey.  As it turns out, Bailey has a secret past as a private detective who was once hired to find a beautiful and dangerous woman named Kathy Moffit (Jane Greer) for a corrupt millionaire named Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas).  The assignment went wrong in many ways, but Bailey is coerced back to do one more job for Sterling. From this point on there is an elaborate and convoluted scheme of deception and betrayal.

Overall, the film has a great film noir look to it and the story is gripping.  Mitchum does a stellar job as the cunning detective and Jane Greer is absolutely irresistible.  Kirk Douglas also sparkles in this movie.  It's also worth noting that this movie was later remade in the early '80s starring Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward in ""Against All Odds"".

The DVD quality is near pristine overall, but some small specs of film deterioration could be seen once in a while during the course of the movie.  The only bonus feature is commentary by film noir author James Ursini.

 A stranger shows up looking for bailey and that only makes the rumors about him worsen.  He accompanies the stranger, who is actually an old friend to Whit Sterling's, who Bailey used to work for, in order to confront mistakes he made in the past.

 many years before he was hired to find Whit's girlfriend kathy who shot whit and preceded to steel $40,000 from him.

Sharp lines like ""[Kathy], you're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another..."" set Out of the Past apart from other, stale crime films by engaging the viewer with their satirical genius.

333768,5,6301491920,"Out of the Past is a classic detective story, practically defining the genre of Film Noir.  Jeff Bailey is the ill-fated detective who, unable to escape his past, is dragged right back into the game.  Jeff's employer is Whit Sterling, who hires him twice: once to find his seductive blonde, Kathie Moffat, and again to clean up some dirty tax business.  After betraying Whit by running off with Kathie, Jeff withdraws from his former life, running a gas station in a small town, and falling in love.  Little does his new lover know that Jeff's secret past, told to her in flashback form, will soon catch up with him and destroy their former relationship...

 The film's Noir elements, contrasted with many original elements throughout, masterfully provide insight into the modern world.  Bailey's small town home appears open, airy, and wonderfully natural.  He seems to live peacefully among a small group of loyal friends, like his deaf-mute companion The Kid.  The shock comes when the classic Noir elements appear.  The crowded, dark streets of San Francisco show the maze of urban society; the accountant's secretary proves the deception inherent in modern humanity; and these elements appear consistently in the genre.  Noir's dark view of today's industrial society permeates this film as well.

 Common Noir scenes also appear frequently.  Jeff tells his past during a dark car ride, an element that shows up in other Noir's like Kiss Me Deadly.

333769,5,6301491920,"That's the title of Lee Server's wonderful biography of Mitchum, and it may well be the most memorable of a  wealth of unforgettable lines in this superbly crafted film.

The best and most definitive noir ever, substantially eclipsing even ""Night and the City.""

Jane Greer is one of the most beautiful, sultry, and alluring femme fatales to ever grace the screen, as well as a marvelous actress, and  Howard Hughes should never be forgiven for depriving us of her for 5 years  when he  blackballed her from the industry after she resisted his advances.

[A classic example of this travesty is another Mitchum vehicle, ""Where Danger Lives,"" which had a part ready made for Greer  that instead went to  Hughes' then recent protege, Faith Domergue, whose ""acting""  could have ruined a school play.]

Mitchum?  What can you say?  This is the role which defined his personna for the rest of his career.  Trenchcoated, laconic,  cynical, sarcastic, fatalistic, and certain of his own doom, he seems to have resigned himself to the fact that, no matter what he does, he can't escape the destiny which awaits him.

He's a clever enough fellow, and he really tries to do the right thing, but he just can't extricate himself from the net which has enveloped him ever since his first gaze upon Kathie Moffat (Greer).

The dialogue is  very stylized but well worth quoting and re-quoting.

For example,an urbane hood, Joe Stefanos (Paul Valentine, the real life husband of Lili St. Cyr), walks into a downtown cafe in a small, pastoral village and starts to ask the girl behind the counter: ""Tell me something. . . .""

Before he can finish, she says, ""You don't look like I could.""

That's where it begins.

The first half of the film, all told in flashback, is far more engaging than the second, as we watch Mitchum's ""Jeff"" become more and more ensnared in the web spun by the gorgeous but sociopathic Kathie.

She even describes herself as ""No good,"" a characterization  richly warranted and heartily concurred in by  Mitchum.

He waits all evening for her in a bar  simply because she had mentioned, ""I SOMETIMES go there."" As he downs shot after shot of Bourbon, he muses to us: ""How big a chump can you be?  I was beginning to find out.""

This film  also contains what may well be THE most romantic scene in cinematic history (with all due respect to Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr):

Jeff and Kathie sitting on an Acapulco beach at night, the wind blowing in her hair, as she (lying, as usual) beseeches Jeff:

""I didn't steal Whit's $40,000.  Won't you believe me?""

To which Mitchum, eyes even droopier than usual, replies: ""Baby, I don't care.""

Even though he eventually discovers what she is and tells her so [""Get out.  I have to sleep in this room;""  ""You're like a leaf that the wind blows from gutter to gutter""], one is left with  the distinct impression that Jeff never truly escapes her spell.

A marvelous cast, including Steve Brodie (""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"") as Jeff's doublecrossing ex-partner and John Kellogg (""The Enforcer"") as of one of Whit's (Kirk Douglas') henchmen.

The film ends with Dickie Moore [Jeff's deaf mute friend and assistant) telling Jeff's ""nice"" girlfriend, Ann (Virginia Huston), that Jeff actually loved Kathie to the end.

Make of that what you will:  Was he lying in order to convince Ann to move on with her life?

Or was he simply telling the truth that he understood better than Mitchum himself did?

Maybe, this movie was best described during its preview on TNT:

333770,5,6301491920,"A heavy lidded Robert Mitchum gets haunted by his past when he is inadvertantly detected by an associate of a wealthy gangster.  Mitchum, playing Jeff Bailey, now operating a service station in a small California town, had previously worked as a slick, smooth talking detective.  He had been hired by calculating gangster Whit Sterling, played by Kirk Douglas to track down his girlfriend Kathy Moffat played by the ravishing Howard Hughes discovery Jane Greer.  The scheming Greer had shot Douglas and absconded with $40,000 fleeing to parts unknown.

Mitchum caught up with Greer in Acapulco.  They eventually hook up and lead a life together on the lam until they are discovered by Mitchum's former partner hired by the unforgiving Douglas.  At this point Greer double crosses Mitchum and runs off.

Years pass and Mitchum, tiring of evading Douglas is persuaded to meet him in his palatial Lake Tahoe mansion.  Douglas convinces Mitchum that he will forget the past if he performs a service for him.  He is to steal some papers from an attorney that implicate him as a tax cheat.  Douglas is actually setting up Mitchum to be framed for murder, using the lawyers' gorgeous secretary Rhonda Fleming as an accomplice.

What follows is a film noir classic that is replete with deceit and double cross.  The excellent acting cast is bolstered by a glibly written screenplay which enhances the well conceived plot.",1113696000,,1413,4.9914529914529915
333771,5,6301491920,"""Out of the Past"" was based on the novel ""Build My Gallows High"" by Daniel Mainwaring (as Geoffrey Homes), which was adapted for the screen by Mainwaring and Frank Fenton. It is one of the most highly regarded film noirs, in part because it typifies the genre in so many ways. The presence of a detective, a femme fatale, fatalism, shady characters, violence, chiaroscuro lighting, double-dealing, and a predominance of night scenes make ""Out of the Past"" unmistakably classic noir.

Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) owns a gas station in a small California town, where he's preparing to settle down with his girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston), when a man from his past arrives to shatter Jeff's quiet life. Three years ago, Jeff was a detective in New York when he was hired by a wealthy gambler named Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) to track down Whit's lady friend who had shot him and absconded with $40,000. The lady's name was Kathie (Jane Greer), and Jeff followed her south to Mexico. But instead of bringing her back to Whit, Jeff fell head over heels for Kathie, and the two ran away together. Now Whit expects payback for his humiliation in the form of Jeff's help in relieving Whit's accountant in San Francisco of some incriminating paperwork.

Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer are perfect in these roles. Mitchum's brooding conveys a man haunted by his past, but his genial unobtrusiveness tells us that he is a basically good guy, unfortunately doomed by fate regardless of his intentions. Jane Greer is beautiful and deadly as the consummately sociopathic Kathie. Half of the story is told in flashback with voiceover narration by Mitchum. Nicholas Musuraca contributes fantastic lighting and cinematography. The plot gets too convoluted for its own good during the San Francisco segment, but ""Out of the Past"" is a wonderfully entertaining movie filmed in multiple scenic locations. And it's one of film noir's most cynical plots, considering that a character who is neither stupid nor immoral is nevertheless doomed.

The DVD: There is an audio commentary by film noir theorist and writer James Ursini. The commentary gives a lesson on the fundamentals of film noir and of the femme fatale by pointing out all of the elements that make ""Out of the Past"" classically noir. Ursini also comments on the film's locations, characters, actors, themes, and techniques, and he analyzes some scenes and dialogue.

333774,5,6301491920,"Along with Billy Wilder's 1944 classic ""Double Indemnity,"" Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past"" stands as the dark cinema's most perfect masterpiece of murder and betrayal deceptively packaged in the form of ethereal beauty.

When Warner Bros. released their ""Film Noir"" boxed set this past summer, Robert Mitchum's bruiser's jowl graced the cover as the exemplar of this uniquely American movie genre: Dark tales of deception, tattered dreams, seduction and ultimate doom painted in shades of pitch black, slivers of shimmering white, and silvery swaths of grey.

Photographed with loving care by Nicholas Musaraca, ""Out of the Past"" follow's Mitchum's former private-eye Jeff Markham, to his new, prosaic, life hiding out in a resort town along Mono Lake in the Sierras. Now pumping gas instead of lead, he's changed his name and wants nothing more than to marry Ann, a girl next door played with innocent candor by Virginia Huston.

One day, though, a menacing figure (Paul Valentine) from Markham's past drives into town and pulls him back out of his idyllic present into his forsaken past.

Through flashbacks, Jeff narrates his seedy past to Ann. We are introduced to the forces who control Jeff, gangster Whit Sterling (the icily manipulative Kirk Douglas) and Kathie Moffat, a femme fatale Douglas hires Mitchum to track down.

Jane Greer is simply ravishing as Kathie, a girl who plays her cards and her .38 close to her vest. She's a mystery to Markham, and once they meet, the chemistry is immediate and all-consuming. Disguised as an angel of deliverance, she leads Markham towards his inevitable demise.

Mitchum plays his tough guy role to a perfect T, but that is what makes this movie so simultaneously satisfying and perplexing: For, no matter how he slugs his way out of tight spots, no matter how he rattles off the haughty smooth talk of a man in charge, Markham can't shake his destiny as fall guy pushed around by the twin forces of power and fate like a pawn on a rigged chessboard.

What is it that makes ""Out of the Past"" such a riveting motion picture? The answer is simple: Everything.

Daniel Mainwaring's (writing as Geoffrey Homes) screenplay strikes a perfect balance of suspense, humor, crosses and double-crosses and slick, wisecracking dialogue. He and uncredited co-writer James M. Cain (author of the immortal pulp trilogy ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Mildred Pierce"") sprinkled the cast of players with memorable bit characters like nudnik Mexican tour guide Jose Rodriguez, toothpick chewing cabbie Petey and Kathie's former maid, Eunice, an ebony beauty who will always be remembered for weighing 131 pounds, *exactly*.

Musaraca's cinematography is simply stunning, and his camera lens rests ever so lovingly on Greer and fellow redhead Rhonda Fleming, his lighting enveloping them in a satiny, radiant sheen.  Filming night for night, he uses arc lamps, endless corridors, flickering fireplace embers and looming auto headlamps to paint tragic hero Mitchum into a corner, trapping him with deep, forboding shadows.

It's also in editor Samuel Beetley's fluid montage which assembles Musaraca's film so seamlessly that it hardly appears edited at all.

Roy Webb's flexible scoring of taking his leitmotif theme through every conceivable music form -- lush Tchaikovsky Romantic, swing jazz, boogie woogie, dark, intoning Wagnerian -- is deftly conducted by C. Bakaleinikoff and expertly woven into the soundtrack by sound editor Clem Portman.

Unlike so many of today's movies, which loudly boast Dolby 5.1 surround and DTS digital sound, you can actually hear every line of dialogue, clearly delivered. While this is mostly due to Portman's competent sound mix, it's also because actors back then used projection and intonation.

""Out of the Past"" is a movie that could have only been made during the glory days of Hollywood's studio system, by a crew that worked like a well-oiled machine.

When you hear the old line ""they don't make 'em like that anymore,"" you'll appreciate the fact that they rarely made pictures so flawless as ""Out of the Past"" even back then.",1103932800,7,4135,5.150746268656716
333775,5,6301491920,"Robert Mitchum stars in ""Out of the Past"" as Jeff Bailey.  As the film opens, he is the owner of a small town gas station; he's romancing a beautiful girl (Virginia Huston) and his life seems idyllic.  However, a stranger arrives looking for Bailey, and everything changes irrevocably.  The story is told partially in flashback - enumerating his past with a cutthroat gangster (Kirk Douglas) and a mysterious moll (Jane Greer) - and partially in the present as his past ensnares him into a complicated morass of murder and revenge.

""Out of the Past"" is a quintessential 1940s film noir, right up there with ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Maltese Falcon,"" although it's arguably not as well known as those classics.  The script is whip-smart and filled with brilliant dialogue - a character asserts to Bailey, ""Don't you see you've only me to make deals with now?"" and Bailey shoots back, ""Build my gallows high, baby.""  Each scene is perfectly shot with an abundance of ambience; director Jacques Tourneur specialized in moody films, such as ""I Walked with a Zombie,"" and he certainly scores here.  The plot is full of crosses and double-crosses - it's admittedly not one of the most complex film noirs; however, the characters are perfectly etched, and the film builds to a heartbreaking conclusion.

In 1991, ""Out of the Past"" was inducted into the National Film Registry, which protects important American films.  The film clearly deserves this honor and fortunately will be preserved for future generations of film noir fans.  Overall, ""Out of the Past"" is one of the best film noirs I've seen and a top-notch movie in every way.  Most highly recommended.

Warners probably took a fresh print from the original RKO materials, which in this case must have come down to us in decent shape (the RKO library is problematic). Warner's hasn't sterilized the film by eliminating absolutely all grain and speckle, however. The minor artifacts that remain are probably on the negative--literally part of the film itself. Kudos to Warners for giving us so many great catalog films on DVD, and for taking the care to make films that are nearly old enough to collect Social Security look better today than they probably ever have before.

Douglas is deliciously sleazy as the gangster who previously employed Mitchum and is now dragging him back in for one more job.  Greer is seductive as the woman who both men share(or do they?) who may be playing both of them for saps.  Manipulation and the double-cross are in evidence here, and the primary strengths of this film is the writing and acting.

333788,5,6301491920,"Among the spate of b&w noir films recently released by Universal and Warner's is this classic. Directed on a somewhat higher budget than most noirs of the 40's, Jacques Tourneur used his considerable skill honed on his 40's noir horror films with Val Lewton to fashion a first class thriller of deceit, lies, double crosses, murder, blackmail etc. all wrapped up with a first rate cast. One time gum shoe Robert Mitchum (now running a small town gas station) is tracked down and hired by Kirk Douglas to find his runaway mistress (Jane Greer) who shot him and ran off with $40,000. He finds her in Acapulco and immediately falls for her deceptive charms. She's a femme fatale with more traps in her web than a black widow spider. Of course, things get complicated (there's a murder and Mitchum disposes of the body) and soon Greer is back with Douglas and Mitchum is up to his neck again with another ""job""...from Douglas. Mitchum is torn between his love for a good girl (Virginia Huston) and the wily machinations of Greer. And this time, he suspects he's being set up as a fall guy by Greer and Douglas. But Greer has her hooks in him good and it looks as if no one will win. Rhonda Fleming is another bad girl Mitchum contends with and there's more murder and mayhem to be dealt with as the walls close in on everyone. ""Out of the Past"" is an incredibly entertaining film that pulls you in and doesn't let up. Mitchum narrates the first part of the story (telling how he got involved to Huston) in typical fatalistic deadpan style.

333790,3,6301491920,"Jacque Tourneur's ""Out of the Past"" is one of the quintessential film noirs. Everything, from Robert Mitchum's musings - ""Build my gallows high, baby"" to the darkly mysterious environment is fraught with subtle entendre and troubling meaning. yet so fascinating that you can't turn away. Robert Mitchum is at his sleepy-eyed, dry and brooding best as Jeff Bailey, the ultra-cool, ultra savvy former P.I. hiding out from his former life as a gas station owner in a little alcove of existence that itself is absent from the mainstream world. But the past catches up with Bailey in the embodiment of callous, calculating career criminal, Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). Whit and Jeff had some spurious goings on once upon a time, an old score that Whit isn't willing to overlook or concede once he finds Jeff. If that was not bad enough, Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) enters the picture as the atypical femme fatale, whose bite is more venomous than the poisonous web of destruction and deceit that she manages to ensnare everyone in. This is a palpable taut thriller with few equals, an intellectual crime drama that puts its remake ""Against All Odds"" to shame. As is to be expected, the plot is anything but straight forward, leading to twists of convention that the first time viewer will be hard pressed to figure out or see coming.
In keeping with Warner's current trend to not really do all that is required to completely remaster classic movies for DVD, the transfer of ""Out of the Past"" is just a bit above average. The gray scale is nicely balanced with deep solid blacks and whites that are relatively clean. There's a considerable amount of film grain and age related artifacts for a visual presentation that, while a considerable improvement over previously issued VHS tapes, is still below par. Edge effects, pixelization and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced. The more intent listener will notice some hiss.

This is the ultimate intellectual crime drama, and a viewing of this film could teach contemporary directors how suspense is supposed to be executed. The plot is so intricate and involved that I won't even discuss it, other than to say this: pay attention. The abrupt plot twists rarely, if ever, turn out like a first time viewer would expect, and the suspense created by director Jacques Tourneur is palpable.

The bad guys get their come-uppance but true to film noir convention, the good-bad guy hero Robert Mitchum doesn't prevail. Most film noir have an earnestness about them, fate and doom hovering in the background.  Much of OUT OF THE PAST is funny in a cynical, world weary, knowing way .  It is to my mind the most enjoyable of all film noir.  Stands up to many viewings and is worth revisiting regularly to remind you what great movie making is.",1035244800,,921,4.491017964071856
333796,5,6301491920,"Film Noir. It is an odd, misunderstood, somewhat underappreciated genre. The genre is also widespread, with dramas and even some comedies having elements of the genre. Which films are the best examples of this group? ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Chinatown"" are certainly good choices, but what about ""Out of the Past""? For one thing, it has everything that defines this dark, unorthodox genre. A private detective (Robert Mitchum's Jeff Markam, who goes under the alias Bailey), a female fatale (Jane Greer's Kathie Moffett), a dangerous yet charismatic bad guy (Kirk Douglas's Whit Sterling), memorable dialogue (""Baby, I don't care"") and amazing cinematography, which combined with the direction can produce many stunning moments. My favorite is the scene where Jeff first goes to Whit's residence. He is actually outside the gate entrance, yet with the way shadows and lighting are used, it seems he could be standing inside. Another example is during the opening credits, when those of Producer Warren Duff and Director Jacques Tourneur are framed as though they are sitting next to the driver of a car.
The film has two other trademarks of film noirs. First the flashback. Here Jeff, who is now a gas station owner, tells his current girlfriend Anne about a business deal he made a few years back with Whit Sterling. Sterling was looking for his wife Kathie, who had recently tried to kill him and stole from him $40,000. Whit wants her back, yet says he doesn't want the money. He is obviously lying. He wants to see if he can use her, though he never states so. He also, as Jeff learned, knows that the forty grand is nothing compared with her. Jeff finds the girl in Mexico and trouble begins. She kills a man named Fisher, who works for Sterling, while he was fighting Jeff (Another great visual image, for during the brawl the shadows across the room were lit up and looked like giants). As a result, she has to leave. Then the story goes back to the present, where Jeff meets Sterling and his apparent wife: Kathie. This is where the second trademark begins: Plot changing. I was able to keep up with the story for awhile, but I was eventually lost in a barrage of murders, double crosses and other twists and turns. But this is part of the fun of this and other film noirs. I dare anybody to logically be able to tell me the entire plot of ""The Big Sleep"".
I mentioned that this movie is full of great dialogue. Here are some of my favorites.
Jeff: My Name is Jeff Markam, and I haven't talked to anybody who hasn't tried to sell me something for ten days.
Jeff: I sell gasoline, I make a small profit. With that I buy groceries. The grocer makes a profit. We call it earning a living.
Whit: My feelings? About ten years ago, I hid them somewhere and haven't been able to find them.
Whit: I fire people but nobody quits me. You started this and you'll end it.
Jeff: That's one way to be clever. Look like an idiot.
""Out of the Past"" is an overall great movie. For one thing, where else could you see Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, two top Hollywood stars of the late `40s-`50s? (And two of my favorite actors) Add in a beautiful Jane Greer, some style and wit and you'll want to add this to your collection. No film buff's library is complete without it.",1019347200,33,3285,4.597955706984668
333797,5,6301491920,"One of the great things about RKO Studios was the manner in which it achieved optimum results with economical budgets. The Melrose Avenue studio turned out some of the greatest film noir suspense efforts of all time, and ""Out of the Past"" ranks with the very best.
The cornerstone of a great film begins with a solid script, and the scenario penned by Daniel Mainwaring adapted from his novel, ""Build My Gallows High,"" using his pen name of Geoffrey Homes on each occasion, is packed with suspense and laced with biting dialogue. The two leads, Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer, represent letter perfect casting, while Kirk Douglas in completing the romance triangle also performs with convincing gusto. The 1947 release made immediate stars of all three performers.
With respect to the part of femme fatale Kathie Moffett, Jane Greer told me in an interview, ""This is the kind of part an actress would die for. There is this great buildup where Kathie is being discussed over and over before she appears. It reminds me of the way that Paramount films would have a big buildup for Alan Ladd. It would make him look ten feet tall by the time he appeared on screen.""
The Mitchum-Greer relationship is explosive throughout. Despite the double dealings of Greer's character Kathie, Jeff Markham-Bailey, played by Mitchum, despite his street smart cleverness, repeatedly succumbs to her seductive beauty. At one point Mitchum exclaims, ""Ah, Kathie, you're so good at changing sides."" The statement is completely accurate as she takes turns playing syndicate boss Douglas and detective Mitchum like Wurlitzers.
In an attempt to break away from his past, Mitchum begins operating a gas station in the small California town of Bridgeport. He begins a romance with Virginia Houston, a wholesome girl whose sincerity contrasts sharply with Greer's duplicity. At one point, after Mitchum meets Greer again when agreeing to perform one last job for Douglas, Houston tells him that ""Nobody is all bad,"" including Greer's character Kathie. ""She comes the closest,"" Mitchum replies acerbically.
Perhaps the most memorable line of the film is when, during a tense moment, Greer exclaims that eventually everyone dies. Mitchum replies, ""Yeah, but if I've gotta die I'm gonna die last."" That succinct dialogue describes determined loner Mitchum perfectly. His romance with Greer, however, leaves him a doomed man. She guns him down in her car just as the police have arrived after Mitchum has alerted them. ""You dirty, double crossing rat,"" Greer snarls as she fatally shoots Mitchum. She then runs into an ensuing hail of gunfire from the police.
""Out of the Past"" is noir suspense at its zenith. The Mitchum-Greer team was reunited two years later for ""The Big Steal,"" which merged comedy and chase scene suspense adroitly.",1009411200,22,2804,5.084598698481562

I didn't know who Jane Greer was and I still don't know why she wasn't a bigger star (she just passed away last summer).  But you could understand why Mitchum's character fell for her character even though he knew exactly what she was like.  Douglas's character is appropriately smarmy and menacing.

Mitchum is left to ""Dump the Body "" and assumes a new role in life one of a owner of a small town filling station. Once again he is discovered by Whit's connections and brought into the greatest double whammy of all time with murder and double cross cumulating in a surprising ending on a country road not unlike the Bonnie and Clyde movie some 15 years later.
Supporting roles add to the movie's success.
Virginia Houston playing Ann the country town girl dominated by her parents but falling for Robert Mitchum, the secretive ""Jeff Bailey"" alas Jeff Markam  the guy who's wrong for her all the way.
Rhonda Fleming portrays a dishonest secretary who double deals, with her boss paying the price with his life and the ""Set Up"" to frame Robert Mitchum, her goal is to only get some fast cash not caring who she messes up along the way. Well played.
Dickie Moore plays the ""KID"" a deaf mute filling station attendant who has a strong loyalty to Mitchum that no words can describe.  The kid shown in the opening scenes with gunmen Joe Stephanos[played by Paul Valentine] is being treated with disdain and arrogance.  In the final scenes Joe tracks Robert Mitchum to an isolated fishing spot by following the KID and climbs to a high vantage point above the river to take aim with a his 45 automatic, he is pulled suddenly by the kid from the high ledge falling to his death in the river. The kid simply used his fishing line and hook to do the job saving Robert Mitchum.
Greatstuff.
This movie is wonderful in every aspect a great piece of Hollywood, great acting, suburb dialogue and the use of a  simple story with plot and counter plot, hidden agenda's and the use of lighting and shadows to their fullest.",979084800,19,3249,4.641739130434782
333801,5,6301491920,"Out of the Past is one of the finest noir pictures ever produced.  The  direction, cinematography, script, and acting are masterfully woven into a  complex tale that heightens the genre's importance to cinematic art.  Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca creates mood, drama, and characterization  with his visually engrossing sets. Stark contrast lighting, which is a  hallmark for noir conventionality, is tempered by Musuraca.  Instead he  employs subtle shades of grey, black, and white which entrance the viewer  into a dangerous realm of duplicitousness. Multiple location shooting by  director Jacques Tourner frees the film from the urban confines associated  with the genre. Musuraca takes full advantage of scenes filmed in Lake  Tahoe, Mexico, and San Francisco by creating shadowy landscapes where  rivers, beaches, cafes, penthouses, and nightclubs provide rendevous points  for the protagonist Jeff Markham ( Robert Mitchum). Mitchum's performance  as the quick witted ex-private eye is memorable.  Concealing a surrepitious  past as a gas station owner, Markham's true identity is revealed when a  hired gun passes through the small town of Bridgewater.  Told partly in  flashbacks, Out of the Past is a maze that explores a wide range of human  emotions.  Kirk Douglas as Whit Sterling is obsessive and vindictive; power  and control define his life.  Virginia Huston as Ann breaks away from the  ""small town/good girl"" image  when she falls for Markam , a man  that  she knows is wrong for her. Unrequited love befalls Jeff, the small  town sheriff who is hopelessly and loyally in love with Ann, but finds none  in return. Greed emerges when Rhonda Fleming portrays a conniving secretary  who sets up her boss for a quick payoff. Male vunerability seeps from  Markam's tough exterior as he succumbs to the allure of one of the most  seductive, double crossing dames ever to appear on film- Kathie Moffit  (Jane Greer). Greer was signed to this picture to act, and act is what she  definitely did.  Literally changing personas by the minute, repentant  mistress to manipulative manhandler, Greer's performance left Lizabeth  Scott something to top.  I think it wasn't until Linda Fiorentino's  performance in The Last Seduction did a woman dominate a film with such  manipulation. The film moves at a quick pace with the dialogue firing as  fast as a 45 automatic. Writer Daniel Mainwaring supplies enough memorable  one liners to induct him into the noir hall of fame.  Finally the loyalty  and trust that is shared by the mute gas station attendant and Jeff Markham  is one of the finest examples of male bonding ever presented on the screen.  One final note, Rhonda Fleming should not have had a larger billing than  Virginia Huston.  Fleming's part is smaller and less central to the  development of the plot.  I recomend viewing this film at least three times  to gain the many perspectives that characterize it as a noir classic.",965347200,,2949,5.1528662420382165
333802,5,6301491920,"I Remember Jane Greer talking about Mitchum in his bio and the fact that Kirk Douglas was trying to "" underact"" Mitchum. Greer says "" Nobody Could Underact Mitchum.
Its true, and this is one of his great  films. As noted the sparkling dialogue such as.... Rhonda Fleming and  Mitchum are walking down a corrider towards an elevator..after just leaving  her boyfriend..she says ' What did you think of him"" Mitchum says  "" He,s a jerk"" Fleming then asks "" Why do you say  that""?
Mitchum says .."" He,s in love with you isn't he!  Look  for Paul Valentine and Dickie Moore as the mute. Classic Mitchum..",952300800,,600,4.5514018691588785

7812413,5,6301491920,"I consider this 1947 film to be one of the all time suspense classics and truly typifies film noir which had its zenith in the '40s and '50s. The cast is robust and outstanding. Direction and editing is equal to the quality performances of the cast. Rock-jawed Robert Mitchum is perfect in this role as the wayward detective. Two well selected screen beauties, Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming, add to the visual delight even for today's audiences. Actually, the entire cast is top notch in this film. This film is a top pick for many old movie buffs, and for good reason.",1522281600,,569,4.588235294117647
