8546355,5,B00A2WNB16,This is Joel Salatin at his best. I will be sharing this lecture/sermon with people that support my work.  I wish that Joel would write a theology of agriculture.,1389571200,2,162,4.586206896551724
8546356,5,B00A2WNB16,Ill admit im not big into religion but its Joel speaking and deff worth the listening. Its not pushing religion or anything just puts Joel's ideals in a biblical sense.,1375660800,,168,4.633333333333334
8546357,5,B00A2WNB16,great dvd we should all go back to our roots.  Everybody should start growing your own self garden to eat from your own back yard.,1369872000,2,130,4.2
8546358,5,B00A2WNB16,"Again, Joel Salatin clearly and creatively communicates our responsibility to care-take the earth that God gave to us to steward. If everyone would hear this message our world would be a beautiful place to live.",1366156800,3,211,5.057142857142857
8546359,4,B00A2WNB16,"I think I expected from looking at the DVD cover that this would be in movie rather than a simple lecture. I was looking forward to images of Salatin's farm, discussions of permaculture while wandering over pastures, etc. Instead it was a simple video taken of Salatin giving a lecture at a conference fall 2012. The information was still excellent and he is an inspiring speaker, so I give it 4 stars. Just not what I expected.",1362441600,11,428,4.571428571428571
8546360,5,B00A2WNB16,"Joel Salatin lays out an articulate vision for how farming and raising animals can look in an age when mass production is the status quo.  He says so well what my husband and I have been saying to each other for a long time: Christians should be more concerned about the earth and its preservation than the greenest of the green, and we have woefully neglected our mandate to fill the earth and subdue it.  If you're interested in finding out how living on and from the land can be a beautiful picture of God's love for His people and His earth, this DVD won't disappoint!",1358121600,7,572,4.386792452830188
