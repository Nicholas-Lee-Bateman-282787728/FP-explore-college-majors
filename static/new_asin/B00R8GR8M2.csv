6901828,5,B00R8GR8M2,"This set of DVDs came in the mail in great condition and each DVD has been playing great. This has to be my all time favorite TV series (I discovered it on Netflix a couple of years ago.). I am loving watching all the episodes on DVD. I can't wait for season 8 to come out on DVD so I can see all of the episodes. Living in the USA, I can't watch it when it is new episodes on the Canadian tv channels and I don't have satellite or cable, so I have to stream the shows to be able to watch them. So happy I was able to get the Complete Seasons 1-7 set. I highly recommend this show to anyone.",1424304000,4,591,3.813008130081301

6901831,1,B00R8GR8M2,Do not buy this dvd set. That is my opinion. Even though Amazon may not like it I thought That's what they wanted my opinion. Anyway I do not recommend buying this dvd set because like I have experience one of the episodes on the dvd has a glitch. It is better to buy them season by season so that if there is a problem you can replace that season not the whole. Now I'm forced to replace season 8 so that I can have all ten seasons. I'm praying that season 9 is perfect or I'll have to replace it to. Well season 9 was fine thank god so one season out of nine that was bad I guess is not to bad. Still I would not recommend buying this in a set but buying them in one season at a time,1519516800,,685,3.797202797202797

6901860,5,B00R8GR8M2,"My brother said this was such a good series that he just keeps watching it over and over. I thought, WOW!!!  So, I looked on Netflix and could not find the DVDS, I cannot stream in my location, and they were not on there. I checked Amazon, and wala, there was the  whole package, except for Season 9, which I will purchase separately, and I purchased them. I have not been disappointed. This series takes me back to good family values, working, sharing, laughing, loving, and all the good memories I have of family life when I was growing up.. It is a very comfortable place to be, very heart warming. I am only into season 3, but these characters grow on me every time I watch a program; they are real.  These are good family entertainment; you will not be disappointed either.",1492473600,6,778,4.426573426573427

6901875,2,B00R8GR8M2,"It took awhile to be able to write this review because we had to watch all 8 seasons in order to rate the entire purchase. Two of the discs won't play at all. We got two duplicate number 3 discs on season 6 and no number 4 disc. Therefore, we are missing four episodes of season 6. Season 7 disc number 5 is mislabled and is actually season 8 disc 6. Very disappointed as it was a Christmas present.",1485302400,4,399,4.063291139240507
6901876,2,B00R8GR8M2,"Let me begin with the disclaimer that I believe Hearltand is, perhaps, the most engaging, lovely television series I have watched in my 58 years.  This review is in no way reflective of the story, the actors, writers or producers of this magnificent series.  I am, however, very, very disappointed in the video quality of the dvd's comprising this order.  Even with upscaling on my Sony Blu-ray player, these videos do not come close to 720P quality.  I have read this complaint from other buyers, but it is worth it to have this story.  I simply wish the video quality was at least on par with a VHS tape.  It is not.  I understand caveat emptor, but this is ridiculous...",1484265600,4,673,4.558333333333334

6901952,5,B00R8GR8M2,"Heartland is my guilty pleasure show, and I am so grateful that we can purchase more current seasons down here in the states. This particular disk set felt a bit cheap; flimsy cardboard cases (two ripped when taking off the outer plastic wrap) and the picture not quite what I would call crisp (thus the loss of a star). But beggars can't be choosers, and maybe/hopefully the picture quality clears up later in the series - I'm only on season 2 as I took the opportunity to re-watch from the beginning.

Edit: the quality definitely improves as the seasons go on, as well as additional special features! Love this, can't wait for season 9",1464825600,2,638,4.5964912280701755

6901987,5,B00R8GR8M2,"What an amazing Canadian spectacular. It is now running its 9th season, so this 8 season set is just for catching up. We bought it in the 8 season set due to the low cost per episode, hoping it was as good as others said. It is better. The cast is changing over the years, and some grow up before your eyes. It is definitely good family entertainment, and a plus if you like horses. There are 4 generations of characters to fall in love with. Something for every age viewer. Action aplenty, heartwarming love scenes, and a vista of Alberta Canada that makes everyone want to visit.

Amber Marshall and Graham Wardle take the primary leads, but Michelle Morgan and Kerry James are right behind. The whole world has fallen for Jack (Shaun Johnston) and Tim (Chris Potter) is so good he's a suburb protagonist one scene and suddenly turns antagonist in a heartbeat, or should I say the buck of a bronc? And all fall in love with Georgie (Alisha Newton) with her child-sophisticated in-your-face honesty that is endearing.

6480 minutes; or 108 hours of perfection in family series drama. Add 1 to 1 1/2 hours of bonus for each of the 8 seasons and you get a bang for your buck. You'll ride tall in the saddle for weeks.
Do the math.
Buy.
Enjoy.
Then, like us, all your extended family will want to borrow the sets.
We'll buy season 9 as soon as it is available, regardless of the price.",1459382400,32,1383,4.440944881889764
