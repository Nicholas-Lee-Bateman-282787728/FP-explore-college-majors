5905528,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Start with the star power: Dame Mirren, Bruce Willis, Zeta-Jones, Malkovich, Anthony Hopkins, and a bunch that also deserve mention - I suppose, in theory, that crowd could make a bad movie, but I have trouble imagining that.

Hopkins deserves special mention. I mean,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malcolm-McDowell/dp/B00125FBTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malcolm McDowell</a>&nbsp;plays the sane psychopath as well as any, and has a four-decade-+ career doing so. But really, with the possible exception of Jack Nicholson, who really makes you believe it? On the other hand, Mirren dominates any stage she walks onto. And Willis has his smart-alecky presence. And Malkovich has this bizarre role that he lives in an utterly convincing way, and being convinced it what makes it so scary.

Despite any unbelievability your might find, and there's a bunch, this comes together in a wholly satisfying spy/adventure/slapstick combination that defies easy description except that it works. Good chases, good fights, good effects, but it's really these huge presences that let the movie come to life.

5905529,1,B00EE6C4NW,"I enjoyed the first Red.  It was okay- not good, just okay. Considering the amount of talent in that movie, it should have been much better.  That is why I had such high hopes for the sequel.  I had hoped the cast might have developed some more chemistry.  Unfortunately, this is a flat out BOMB!  P.U.!  It is worse than Hudson Hawk.
The script is a confused mess.  The movie jumps from scene to scene with no explanation and no transitions, leaving the viewer wondering why everyone is shooting at one another. The plot is D.O.A.  The acting is really sub-par, especially that of Mary-Louise Parker.  Her performance is bad enough to end whatever career she  had. Atrocious.  The movie tries to be a comedy at times, but completely misses the mark.  It ends up exactly like an overstuffed deli sandwich- all ham and cheese.",1374883200,9,825,4.613793103448276
5905530,2,B00EE6C4NW,"Not as good as ""Red,"" this sequel has a creaky plot, whose three sections don't segue. Jumping from one continent to another doesn't help. Then there are its many cliches: Rescue from a firing squad, turning the bad guy around, avoiding execution at the last minute. The chase scene is a mite long. Much too many rounds of automatic weapons fire. The running gag about putting Willis in touch with his sensitive side falls flat. Hopkins character isn't convincing, though Helen Mirren's impersonation of a mad Queen Elizabeth II is inspired, if brief. All this would have worked, if done campy, but done straight is a tad too much to ask from an audience, except at a Drive-in. As is, this is this a bad script perpetrated to exploit superannuated actors with box office appeal. Bottom line: Don't bother.",1374624000,5,805,4.798561151079137
5905531,5,B00EE6C4NW,"""Red 2"" is a superb action film that touches on the continuation of most of the characters from the first Red film. My husband and I both agreed that ""Red 2"" was even better than the first ""Red."" However, he was undecided at first about who was his favorite character. This was because Bruce Willis and Louise Parker elegantly played a couple very much in love and playing out their relationship among various heists. Lee Byung-hun gave a marvelous performance as a gifted assassin who deep down has a good sense of right and wrong. However, my husband admitted that he enjoyed Anthony Hopkins in the role as Dr. Edward Bailey the most. This was because Hopkins gave an admirable performance as a physicist who is called upon for his talents. My favorite performances were a tie between Helen Mirren as Victoria Winters and John Malkovich as Marvin Boggs. Mirren gives a splendid performance as a trained and true femme fatale who still has a heart for her fellow friends while accomplishing her duties in an efficient manner (there is a comical scene where she is portraying the queen of England). My husband also liked Mirren's performance, but more for her flirty demeanor and her elegant style while doing one of her jobs (there is a scene where she is aiming her gun in a stylish outfit and letting her boyfriend touch her feet). I enjoyed Malkovich's commendable performance as Boggs because he plays a man with the right touch of paranoia who also is a skilled mediator for his fellow colleagues/friends. There are also electrifying scenes in the movie where the characters are shown traveling to England, France, and Russia. ""Red 2"" is a terrific film for those who enjoyed the first ""Red"" movie and/or like action films. The following actors/actresses also play important parts in ""Red 2"": Catherine Zeta Jones as Katya, Brian Cox as Ivan Simanov, David Thewlis as The Frog, and Neal McDonough as Jack Horton.",1374364800,78,1918,4.815151515151515
5905532,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Every time a new sequel comes out, it pretty easy to question the driving force behind the reason it's made. Do most sequels need to be made? Naturally, the immediate response would be no, they don't NEED to be made. But, aside from food, water, and a handful of other things, we really don't NEED that much. Make no mistake, there isn't a sequel in the history of film that NEEDED to be made, but when it comes to sequels - it's all about the entertainment value, mixed with a desire to make a bang at the box office. Moviegoers see a good, possibly great film and want more. We didn't NEED The Godfather Part II, but it's difficult to imagine a world where it was never made. The same can be said about a slew of other sequels, like The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, or Aliens. Quite honestly, sequels provide a simple desire to consume more of the same (with the hopes of it being better than or at least as enjoyable as the original). However, not every film deserves a sequel. It's an absolute rarity that a sequel will live up to the original, which is the reason sequels have a reputation of being inferior films. As all of this pertains to yet another comic book sequel, RED 2 - the question becomes: did this film really NEED to be made?

Directed by Dean Parisot (Fun with Dick and Jane), RED 2 stars Bruce Willis who reprises his role as Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent attempting to live a normal life. Frank is still dating Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), but the relationship doesn't have the flavor it once did - you know, without the bullets flying through the air. As it turns out, Frank and Marvin (John Malkovich) have a mysterious hit put on them by MI6, which includes their old cohort, Victoria (Helen Mirren) and an ambitious assassin for hire, Han (Byung-hun Lee). It's another average day in the life of Frank Moses as this new adventure takes him and his ""assailants"" around the world to uncover the mystery known as ""Nightshade"" and save the globe from the usual nuclear threat of death and destruction. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Brian Cox, and Neal McDonough also star in supporting roles.

It's no surprise that filmmakers continue to dip into the comic book ""house of ideas."" After all, they provide for a pretty substantial stream of income for the parent company behind it. And, RED is no exception - even though it was a quick three issue ""one-and-done"" limited series (written by Warren Ellis). A film adaption for RED was not entirely unexpected. However, with it being such a brief story (leaving so little to lean on as far as characters and plot direction goes), it's a bit of a surprise that RED even had chatter about the possibility of a sequel. But, that's Hollywood.

The first film was fun and quirky (as many films are in the action-comedy genre), yet it's difficult to decipher what more could be done with these characters on the big screen - hence the major issue with this sequel. If you watched RED 2 on a screen right next to RED, you'd basically be watching the same exact movie - only recycled. They both have an identical 2 hour running time, focus heavily on the relationship between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker's characters, and both rely on John Malkovich for comedic support. While the ""retired and extremely dangerous"" premise was amusing and entertaining the first time around, it's difficult to see the point of the sequel. Sure, it's entertaining - but it's literally a continuation of the same characters doing exactly the same things, only this time they're constantly bouncing from country to country at the snap of a finger. Eventually, the plot becomes clear - but all too predicable - yet the constant jumping from scene to scene (for the first hour or so) makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what and which character is good or bad. Basically, they sacrifice plot for pointless explosions, cheap one-liners, and a mediocre car chase.

Now that the nitpicking is out of the way, it should be noted that the good things about RED 2 certainly outweigh the fact that it's nothing more than a recycled version of the first film. From top to bottom, this cast is smart, funny, and full of chemistry. On his own, John Malkovich carries this film on his back as the slightly-crazed, overzealous side-kick, Marvin. His variety of facial expressions, not to mention his relationship advice, will keep the laughs flowing continuously. And, for some reason - every single time John Malkovich utters the name ""Frank,"" it's a chilling reminder of his role as Mitch Leary in the drama, In the Line of Fire. His co-stars, Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, provide just enough interest themselves - bickering back and forth as they continue their unorthodox relationship. While Bruce Willis basically has the same role as the first film, Parker is no longer simply along for the ride. She's no CIA agent, but she's at least involved in the action and contributing much more than the last time we saw her. Speaking of action, Byung-hun Lee and his athleticism is always a pleasure to watch.

Overall, RED 2 is nothing more than an average action-comedy, using a silly recycled plot and masterful casting to provide a lighthearted, entertaining film. Still, there's very little that separates this film from previous flicks, like Austin Powers, Rush Hour, or Lethal Weapon. Although its predecessor was highly entertaining, RED 2 feels more like an unnecessary sequel that didn't NEED to be made, carrying no other intention than to make a typical studio money grab. Regardless, the plot's constant character misdirection will at least hold your attention and keep you guessing (at least for a while) about who's pulling the strings from the shadows. There's enough comedy, action, and nonsense to fuel this film for the full two hours without making it actually feel like a two hour film. It's entertaining, charming, and completely unrealistic - and oddly enough, absolutely worth the price of admission.

5905533,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Here they are again, our favorite former black-ops CIA agents, still Retired and Extremely Dangerous, who must reunite and track down a portable nuclear device, invented by a man who has been held  for over 30 years in an institution for the criminally insane.

If you saw the original ""Red"" you know that after all the wild events, Frank and Sarah became a couple. Now we get to see what happens AFTER the ""happily ever after...."" (It's hilarious!)

We see:
  * Bruce Willis (""Red"") Frank is in a domestic frenzy, deliriously heaping his shopping cart at Costco with countless household items.
  * John Malkovich (""Red"") Marvin is horrified to see Frank in this condition. He will do anything...
  * Mary-Louise Parker (""Red"") Sarah has an edge over Frank and Marvin: people LIKE her, but she can only watch Frank's new-found domesticity with a mixture of dismay and affection.
  * Helen Mirren (""Red"") Victoria is in the middle of another ""side job"" when our friends contact her.
  * Byung-hun Lee (""G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra"") Han Cho Bai has a contract to kill Frank.
  * Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Side Effects"") Katja is a Russian operative who formerly worked for the KGB. She and Frank have a ""history.""
  * Anthony Hopkins (""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"") Bailey is our mad scientist.

This PG-13 outing is another wild ride with our favorite foursome, maybe even wilder than the original: Our screening audience laughed all the way through.  Expect vehicular mayhem, endless gunfire and blowie uppie stuff, hardly any profanity, several interesting kisses but no sweaty bodies. Mirren makes a great Mary, Queen of Scots, Parker speaks lousy Russian, Malkovich is fetching in a Carmen Miranda chicka-chicka boom hat and Willis plays Willis flawlessly.

My only complaint is that Brian Cox's character isn't in this one as much, pretty much a passing cameo.

Who would love this movie? Those that love action/ spy movies, as well as those who love comedies, because there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to be had.

5905666,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Red 2 is available for the first time on 4K Ultra HD. Retired black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Wilis) reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives  consisting of Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren)  for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. To succeed, they must survive assassins, terrorists, and power-crazed government officials, all eager to get their hands on the devastating superweapon. Anthony Hopkins plays an eccentric scientist and expert at creating bombs whos been kept under wraps for 31 years because he was deemed too dangerous to be let loose.

Director Dean Parisot incorporates lots of action, and sets up precarious situations that endanger the main characters. Once again, the tone shifts between typical action flick and comedy, but the balance works. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the cast as a Russian agent.

The film is available for the first time on 4K Ultra HD, which provides over four times the resolution of full HD and delivers the brightest, most vivid and truest color with the greatest contrast. The 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release also features Dolby Vision and Dolby immersive audio, providing a theatrical experience for home viewing.

5905684,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Just finished watching ""RED 2"" released by Summit Entertainment.
Based on the original graphic novel published by DC, RED 2 picks up life with retired, extremely dangerous CIA Black OPS agent Frank Moses as he's trying to keep his girl friend safe by keeping her in the gilded cage of domestic tranquility.  It's only when his best friend fakes his death over the release on the Internet about a nuclear device that was smuggled into the heart of the Kremlin during the height of the Cold War.
Now contracts are placed on Moses, so he must go back on the run with his girl friend and old team once more in order to retrieve the device and keep it out of terrorist hands.  Curiously there are two interesting homoerotic moments in ""RED 2.""
""RED 2"" is a fun sequel,

5905918,4,B00EE6C4NW,"RED 2 is a clear violation of the Sequel Law.  (The Sequel Law:  Sequels suck.)  Most of the players return from the original that became a sleeper hit; this group of Retired and Extremely Dangerous (RED, get it?) former secret operatives have grand adventures in Europe as they race against time to find a hidden weapon of mass destruction, planted decades ago by a deranged scientist.  Meanwhile the characters play off of one another in a way that can only be described as fun (and funny).  Bruce Willis' Frank Moses may be fighting some bad guys, but he's never going to take anything seriously, and that's the charm of this RED franchise:  As in the original, it's obvious that the cast members are having a blast making RED 2.

Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, John Malkovich (by far my favorite), Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox all return as the RED group, and in this installment they are joined by Catherine Zeta-Jones (who is aging like a fine wine), Byung-hun Lee, Neal McDonough, and the delightful Anthony Hopkins (playing the deranged scientist).  Memorable moments include Mirren acting like a lunatic and Lee's character destroying a Parisian city block with the ultimate machine gun.  The sequence in the Kremlin is as entertaining as it is hilarious--especially when a Russian clerk tries to hit on Parker's character.  RED 2 is nonstop fun--just like its predecessor--and it's a fun ride because its ensemble is having such a grand time bringing the film to its audience.  I'm just happy the Sequel Law was broken.

5906010,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I've read several reviews stating Red 2 was not as good as the first Red movie.  I respectfully disagree.  Red 2 is full of action, humor and complex characters with a few nice twists through out the movie.  The actors (especially Anthony Hopkins) give believable performances.  What I really appreciate about Red 2 (and the first Red movie) is the way female characters are portrayed...strong, smart, funny and just as capable as the men.  Is this an Academy Award winner?  Probably not.  But it's a fun-filled ride that I enjoy watching over and over again.",1464048000,,559,4.821052631578947

I'm trying to decide if it's a standalone or not.  I think it could be fun without seeing the first one, but it's definitely enhanced if you've seen the first one.",1446854400,,520,4.4526315789473685

5906360,1,B00EE6C4NW,"As brilliantly spontaneous and engaging as the original Red is, Red 2 is contrived and flat on an equal scale - something that I suppose is true of many sequels.  Perhaps my expectations were too high but I found Red 2 barely interesting enough not to turn it off mid-stream.  The characters lost the feeling of spontaneity that made the original so enjoyable.  The plot, though not awful, is forgettable. The gun play and violence was gratuitous and at times so over-the-top that it overshadowed the story.  I only recommend you watch if you just can't find something else that piques your interest.",1440374400,,600,4.796116504854369

5906433,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I would give this a 5, but I've been hearing too many stories about what a jerk Bruce Willis is to his colleagues & crew. Having grown up in Hollywood and meeting many celebrities, I've learned that the one thing you DON'T want to do is meet your favorite actor, because you will most likely hate them after meeting them. I expect that's how it is with Bruce. He's a very talented actor and I like his movies, but his arrogance and disdain for those who have helped him get to where he is, really makes me not like his work as much. So I really liked the movies with a wonderful cast & quite frankly, John Malkovich was the best part of both movies.",1437091200,,649,4.2

I am thinking about not renewing my Prime subscription which is getting more expensive without any prior notification.  Amazon's getting to big for it's britches, and the last place you should be cutting corners is in Prime subscription services................I am far from being the only person who feels this way.

That said, the cast is stellar as usual, but the introduction of the other characters was unnecessary, I felt.  It was unclear what role the new Russian woman actually played (other than the foil for Willis in his love interest) and the story could have just as easily (and I think BETTER) played by the previous characters from the original movie.  The Asian assassin was ""good"" at what he did, but I felt his character was written BADLY.  He needed integrated into the movie better and SOONER.  Not the actor's fault, clearly, and he did well with what he was allowed to do, but it was not a good use of a new character.  I'd rate this a rental on a rainy afternoon only.  Don't buy it unless you rent fist.  You may not need to bother because although the actors hold up their end.....the writing is not very good.",1434412800,,926,4.30635838150289

5906575,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I avoided seeing Red 2 because of the negative stuff I read, and I should've known better. Though the first was wrought with genius and focus, the second is still fun, with clever lines, and the unmistakeably endearing chemistry of Willis-Malkovich-Parker. Helen Mirren is back with kick-ass sass, and  I had just about as much fun as with the first.

You could do a lot worse. Being of ""a certain age"", watching the old farts beat up bad guys is loads of fun, more so than the ""other"" franchise (Expendables). Unlike that series, all of the main characters have an individuality that makes you really care. Kick back and enjoy!",1431388800,,628,4.7

5906582,2,B00EE6C4NW,We loved the first Red but found this disappointing. There are a few giggles and loads of extremely loud action but it's mostly just tedious and irritating. Whatever made the magic in the original was missing here. Lately the oldies on Turner Classics seem to beat the pants off some of this new and mindless crapola...two stars for barely watchable.,1431216000,,350,4.85

But when a movie studio releases dreck like this and pretends it's an action film for people of all ages then I hate the fact that they ever were in the film industry to begin with.

5906743,5,B00EE6C4NW,"What a breath of fresh air; a bunch of brilliant actors having a great time cramming every action movie clich in to a smidge under two hours of rip-roaring brain-out entertainment.

The all-star cast of Retired Extremely Dangerous old-school black ops types are back, saving the world again, this time from a magnificently bonkers Anthony Hopkins. John Malkovich shines again as Marvin and Bruce is, well, still Bruce and everybody is just brilliant; it is not possible to single out a single cast member for particular praise.

Penned by the same writing team as the first film, but under a different director (the same chap who brought us the splendidly daft Galaxy Quest), Red 2 dovetails perfectly with its predecessor. The carefully not quite over-the-top humour is unexpectedly subtle at times and manages to avoid being juvenile & shallow; the cast operates as a skilled and craftsman-like whole (youd expect nothing less from such experienced actors); the pace is relentless and there are some cracking stunts in fancy cars.

RED 2 is massively entertaining, surprisingly witty and superb fun. A perfect case-study in pure entertainment and even better, if thats possible, than the first movie. Simply brilliant  if your heads aching from trying to figure out Cloud Atlas then give it a rest and watch this!!",1421539200,,1316,5.078703703703703

5906774,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Red humorously introduced most of the characters with several surprises and twists. Red 2 didn't introduce any significant new characters, only secondary plot players. Further development of the main characters seemed sappy, unremarkable overkill. Even the opportunity to engulf the new scientist in mystery, for some odd reason, was replaced by advanced warnings early in the movie so there were very few surprises. still, the movie was a fun spoof that makes up for several short-comings by creating truly absurd and/or lighthearted action scenes similar to the first movie.

Shame it didn't do better than the first one, but not unexpected. The troupe is in fine form and Anthony Hopkins makes a difference to the mix. You know everyone is having a ball but nonetheless it`s so well executed...Good action comedies seem all too infrequent nowadays which makes RED 2 a real treat.",1419811200,,448,4.8311688311688314

Malkovich was superb in this role but very reminiscent of his Edward Teach mannerisms.  Perhaps that is the very existence of Malkovich.  Helen Mirrin's character could have been lifted from Ian Fleming's James Bond's female character ""M"" played by Dame Judith Dench should she ever have been let loose in the field.",1417910400,,460,4.784810126582278

A shout out to Byung Hun Lee for a delicious turn as a Korean assassin.  Terrific entertainment with or without the popcorn.",1412467200,,419,5.132352941176471

5907003,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I have seen both Red #1 and #2 at the movies and liked both of them so much that I have purchased them when they came out on DVD.  I liked Reds 2 even more than Reds 1.  This movie can be considered both a comedy and an action film  combination and also has a fantastic cast.  They include:  Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louis Parker, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Byung Lee, Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.  There is nothing like a combination kind of movie which has both humor and action.

RED means Retired-Extremely-Dangerous. In this DVD Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) gets his old CIA black-ops group together again to search for a portable nuclear device. In their quest they run up against a whole group of bad people such as terrorists, assassins and of course the corrupt and power hungry government officials.

If you like an entertaining comedy and action movie with lots of great stars you should check out this Red #2 DVD.  A fun to watch movie.

5907069,5,B00EE6C4NW,"One of those rare instances where the sequel is just as good as the original, maybe even better. I am not a fan of the action comedies but RED 2 is a good mix of the two. I am all about the action and the fight scenes in this movie are so well done. The storyline is excellent for this type of film and will definitely hold your attention. If the Expendables are the senior citizen army. Then RED is the senior citizen CIA. This sequel was so good that there needs to be a RED 3. Another plus for RED 2 is that it is a totally independent story. You don't have to see RED to understand and enjoy RED 2.",1408665600,,602,3.942622950819672

We started watching it and found it to be too abrupt and crude for our tastes and gave up on it after the first 20 or so minutes. Based on the other reviews, it appears this is another case of ""the eye of the beholder"" so I would only suggest, if you have not seen and enjoyed Red, to rent Red 2 before buying it. By way of contrast, we are fans of the Bourne series.

There is no question it is fast paced and filled with action so if that is your main benchmark for excellence this may well be one you will enjoy.",1406419200,,589,3.908333333333333

Other than a flash in the pan, I can't figure out why Catherine Zeta Jones was in this movie. She added little to nothing and then died.

5907227,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I checked the first RED out at the library a while back. Overall, it was enjoyable. But hardly the greatest movie I'd ever seen. It was mildly amusing and I chuckled a few times at the jokes. The action sequences were a bit over-blown and so all-in-all I thought it was just okay. Worth seeing once. Watching films at the cheapie theater all the time a while back, I kept seeing advertisements for this movie even though it was already out. I figured I would see it when it came to the cheap theater, but never got around to it. Then I figured I'd check it out at the library. The wait was long. But I finally got around to seeing this movie. And I was shocked, SHOCKED by how much I like this film.

The first one was amusing, this one is hilarious

First thing is first, you don't really need to see the first RED in order to watch this one. All you need to know is, there's a bunch of spies who are in retirement but are considered R.E.D. ""retired extremely dangerous"". One of them got himself a girlfriend and through a series of traumatizing adventures she found out all about him and decided to stay with him anyway. And thus the stage is set for a sequel. The first film seemed to a have a rather dark tone compared to this one, which is quite frankly absolutely ridiculous most of the time. There is violence in this film but it's far more cartoonish on the whole than the first film.

I don't even remember the plot of the first RED (did it have one?). This sequel has your usual by-the-number secret scientist/secret weapon/chase the macguffin plot. It is however very well done and extremely entertaining. This is because pretty much EVERYONE in this film is likable and hilarious every second they are on film. Take the wife/girlfriend trying to act the spy who is hilarious, over-the-top and believable (she actually has talents, just like a real human being, as opposed to some damsel-in-distress stereotype). Her relationship with the other main character is charming and silly and laugh-out-loud funny rather than the groan-inducing stereotype that most films feature. Then there's the exotic-ex femme fatale, the goofy best friend, the wacky scientist, and the always incredibly charming and way-too-hot-to-be-your-grandmother Helen Mirren. Everyone is going to like at least one of the good guys in this film, and probably most with love them all.

Honestly, if you like dark humor, action films, ANY of the stars of this film, spy films, or just a good comedy, you owe it to yourself to give this one a watch. It is superbly written, delightfully acted, ridiculously entertaining, and wonderfully big-hearted. Recommended.",1404172800,,2641,4.734782608695652

Retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to well, does it really matter why?

What did I think?

Theres always an inherent risk in making a sequel to a quirky surprise movie. Can they sustain the charm without the unexpected character twists of the first film?

Well Red 2 starts off well as a jaunt that doesn't take itself seriously. The action is fun, the premise of the character development is plausible and the laughs are present. However a flat middle means the movie drags a bit and the ending is bland. But Helen Mirren steals the show whenever shes on screen, mitigating the damage somewhat. We're left with a movie thats entertaining enough I suppose but it really lacks depth, emotion and re-watchability.",1403913600,,807,4.826086956521739

It has an all-star cast, the plot is interesting, the characters are well-acted, and the action moves along. The best part of RED and RED2 is the humor in them. There are some great lines, all delivered deadpan, and a lot of comic relief throughout. I really appreciate that there are almost as many women with important roles as there are men. The scenarios are highly improbable, however. How do they get money without being discovered and tracked? How do they get from country to country without being stopped? How do they concoct a precise and complicated plan in minutes? Things get blown up with barely anyone noticing, and gun fights take place in public with hardly a blip.

I watched the first installment of RED and loved it. This movie was still entertaining, but not as good. It seemed like they took the Expendables franchise approach and added more ""past their prime"" actors to pad the cast list.

Catherine Zeta-Jones- As much as I love her, she seemed completely unnecessary in this film. Her character dies rather abruptly, before she has a chance to contribute much to the plot line. Without her, very little to nothing would have changed in the movie.

Anthony Hopkins- one of the villains of the movie. As always, he does the crazy, unpredictable old man angle well.

There were parts of the movie where I was disappointed. Our first introduction to Han is when he is stripped naked, given a kimono/robe, and still manages to complete his contract on an older VIP. With his mission complete the movie misses a potentially cool fight scene with Han escaping the facility with literally nothing but the origami swan.

The car chase scenes were definitely the best part of the movie. Nicely done!",1402272000,,1092,4.756613756613756

The premise of this misery is a group of retired CIA or it's equivalent else-where in TV world. 30 minutes is all it took for me. I understood the plot,, the action and that the actors must have done this for the money.

There was a Red1, and now there is a RED 2. The main players from RED, Bruce Willis, Brian Cox, Helen Mirren, Mary-Louise Parker and John Malkovich return, don't ask why. Frank Moses, played by Willis, and his partner Marvin Boggs, played by John Malkovich return, with Boggs trying to warn Moses of impending danger. One by one all the characters appear, don't ask why, mayhem ensues, the bad guys are killed, maimed or left silent for a time. That's it.

It was like they took all of the good things about the first movie and then killed the second with ad-nauseum repetition. We bought the movie thinking it would at least hold a candle to the first in cleverness. But alas, that flame was snuffed out in the first 15 minutes. Don't waste your time or money.

5907300,4,B00EE6C4NW,"In 2010, DC Comics introduced the world to one of it's lesser known series, R.E.D. (Retired Extremely Dangerous). What I loved about that film was that it took old school action stars and put them into a modern action movie. The expectations for action movies are much higher today, no longer are they just chases, explosions, and gun fights. Today, people expect action films to have some kind of story, characters with personality, and even some humor. RED delivered all that and more and so does it sequel. Even though there are some bigger names in RED's second installment, the humor didn't play as big a role as it did previously and the story moved a lot faster. To some, this may have been a good thing, but for me, too much happened too quickly. I liked it better when we didn't know the characters or what to expect from them, when things were explained, and not just delved into. The first film made RED seem very original, but it's sequel really does play like a story that was adapted from a comic. Don't get me wrong though, while the second film doesn't compare to the first, it is still far better than some of the other action films released lately. You really can't go wrong in having an action film that stars Bruce Willis and John Malkovich, they seem to just be oblivious to the signs of aging and are as believable today as they were in their prime. Alone, this pair would have been terrific, but you add true legends of the screen like Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirran to the cast, and honestly, I don't see how any movie fan would want to miss that! The acting is terrific and the story, while proceeding much too quickly, was still a pretty interesting one. I did really enjoy RED 2, my only wish is that they had slowed things down a little and let us catch our breathe.",1399939200,2,1796,4.445454545454545

Who knows what's going on with the plot or why things happen as they do in the RED series, just go along with the ride and enjoy.

Anthony Hopkins, as the somewhat flakey mad scientist and Byung Hun Lee  as the run amok assassin as well as the original cast all played their roles to the max.  The only problem the stood out about the movie is that with so many fine actors in the tale, the story line became somewhat choppy as each sequence of actors needed to get their time on stage.

Although it starts off full force with no introduction of characters since we should obviously know them from the first movie, that's no problem. Plenty of explosions, and whole scale death as retired  (and not so retired) spies try to survive by outwitting, allying with, and double-crossing each other. A lot of people get killed but most of it is remarkably not detailed, just bang-bang or ka-boom and bodies fly and that's it. It's  tongue-in-cheek, and just violent enough to give it an unreal quality.  John Malkovitch is great as the near-paranoid one with Bruce Willis as the most sane (?) of the bunch.

We loved Red; Red 2 seemed to miss what made the original so enjoyable.  Red 2 tries to make lots of violence look a lot funnier than it is.  John Malkovich pretty much steals the show in this one; Bruce Willis just seems to be going along for the ride.

5907355,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Like a lot of sequels, this second outing wasn't either as much fun or as clever as the first one. It has too much of everything, but lacks the most important thing--the original's film's quirky charm and its darkly comic subplot of a ruthless professional assassin longing for love and normalcy.

I think it was also a big mistake not to have both Helen Mirren and Brian Cox back for the sequel--both helped to give credence to the idea that it was possible to be R.E.D. (retired, extremely dangerous). Red-2 The Sequel goes over the top in every regard--special effects, too many strange characters--but nevertheless falls flat. And it does so because it lacks the tongue-in-cheek humor and subtle digs at our modern society that the first movie did so well. In addition, the plot is too far out even for a fantasy, and even the wonderful John Malkovich seems entirely out of place here. In fact, I can't think of a single funny scene in this sequel. I still highly recommend the first movie to anyone who cares to listen--but sadly Red-2 doesn't come close to the comedic standards set in the first film.",1397347200,,1107,4.676923076923077

Helen mirrim was great as usual, playing the tongue in cheek assassin role.  Carol Zeta Jones was over the top as the russian secret agent, with a thing for Bruce Willis.  But Mary Louise Parker stole many of the scenes, with her attempts to get in on the action.  Anthony Hopkins was a riot as the demented scientist, with his secret agenda.

5907423,3,B00EE6C4NW,"The original ""Red"" from 2010 was surprisingly fun.  A collection of past-their-prime actors play roles of former intelligence agents brought back into the global fight for right vs. wrong.  Morgan Freeman is missing in this outing but is replaced by Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Russian KGB agent.  At least she's better to look at.

Frank (Bruce Willis) is playing house with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and the film opens in a Costco proving the couple is trying to adapt to regular life.  It doesn't last long.  In a convoluted story, an experimental nuclear weapon, built by an imprisoned scientist (Anthony Hopkins joins the party), is about to fall into the wrong hands.  Marvin (funny as ever John Malkovich) reappears to recruit Frank, and Sarah comes along for the ride.

Things get further complicated as Frank's old partner, Victoria (Helen Mirren), has been hired to kill him.  Then there is Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee) who is also out to kill Frank to settle some old grievance.  And the aforementioned Katja (Zeta-Jones) who just happens to be an old girlfriend of Frank's has her own agenda.  The gang continues to have fun with the premise, but the film is long on comedy and short on substance.  The death toll is in the hundreds, most killed with a casualness that is a bit silly.

Frank can still kick ass as can Victoria.  Sarah is a quick learner.  Marvin is as smart as he is funny.  Neal McDonough plays the bad guy who is also well placed in the U. S. government.  He seems to want to challenge Willis in the battle of one-liners.  This is all just a retread of the original, even if it isn't hard to watch.  I understand there are more sequels coming.

I actually watched this movie on a Netflix Blu ray disc rental.  The video resolution was 1080p and had an aspect ratio of 2.40:1.  The disc had a nice film-like quality.  Some of the locations featured nice outside settings and the colors all looked very good.  I did think some of the car chase sequences were overloaded with obvious CGI.  Overall the transfer was crisp and clear with no issues.  While I've gotten Netflix rentals before that left out an extras (mostly recent blockbusters), this is the first time I was shortchanged on the audio.  If you buy the disc you will get a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  My copy only had Dolby Digital 5.1.  While it sounded fine, it wasn't the uncompressed audio I was expecting.  Netflix just trying to piss off its customers again.",1395273600,,2456,4.644186046511628

5907425,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Or else what?  Or else I'll be disappointed I guess, but it sounds a little like the kind of thing someone would say in this movie.
There is a lot to like in this film, although really it should be a guilty pleasure.  It's one of those action-comedy movies
(with a little romance thrown in) that features killings, torture, explosions, lies and double-crosses, but is so funny most
of the time that you can't take all the violence very seriously.  It's not just Malkovich's character that has the funny one-liners
(although I'm sure he had more than anyone else).  Pretty much everyone gets in at least a few good zingers.

It's been so long since the first film I had forgotten what RED even STOOD FOR (retired, extremely dangerous).  I also
learned that ICE can mean something besides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (here, it means Incarcerate,
cannot execute)  It also features as central to the story the exposure of a decades-old plot involving a fearsome
nuclear weapon made with RED MERCURY!  [This had me scurrying to Wikipedia; it is truly amazing the weird stuff
you can learn from watching movies.  Red mercury actually has featured in a number of sting operations of would-be
buyers of nuclear weapons material.  Most ""experts"" agree that it does not exist while a few believe it really DOES
exist but those who know about it aren't allowed to acknowledge its existence.  Even the name is subject to dispute,
as to whether the ""red"" refers to it first being developed by the Soviets, and others believing it refers to the material's
color.  In any case there it is: a real-life rumor used as part of the plot.

Great cast + fast pace + lots of wry humor + plenty of money for blowing things up and special effects = large entertainment
value.  I'll add that I hadn't watched Byung-Hun Lee before; he is a South Korean actor who has had great reviews in non-Hollywood films, and Red 2 is probably his biggest film role (in terms of commercial success).  Although he's over 40, his physique and seemingly boundless energy would have me believing he's far younger, and he was fantastic in his role as a contract killer who (seemingly like everyone in the world of espionage) has a past history with Bruce Willis's character....

Not enough good comedy films these days; if you ever like an action/comedy film, you should enjoy this one.",1395187200,,2350,4.737100737100737

5907428,1,B00EE6C4NW,it was boring.  usually that happen with sequels movies of this type.  Red 1 was far much better.  Hope the producer don't think on a third part it will be a failure.,1395187200,,166,4.125
5907429,5,B00EE6C4NW,"the crew is back in this sequel to Red and they're almost as good as in the first movie. John Malcovich was a lot funnier in the first one,but I still give this a strong two-thumbs up!! Definitely worth the money and time to watch it.

5907436,4,B00EE6C4NW,Reds 2 is just as funny as Reds was. I think they could squeeze another two movies out of this and be just as funny.,1395100800,,116,3.68
5907437,5,B00EE6C4NW,I love the humor and action in this movie. Bruce Willis is a good looking guy for his age. Anything with John Malkovich in it has my vote.,1395100800,,138,3.9642857142857144

5907439,3,B00EE6C4NW,This sequel tries hard to live up to the the original RED. Unfortunately it fails to deliver. It plays like a hurried up effort to capitalize on the success of the original while it's memory was still fresh. I wish the producers had taken more time to develop a better script.,1395014400,,276,4.431372549019608

5907443,3,B00EE6C4NW,"The first one was a blast that was never taking itself too seriously. This one has much less jokes, tries to be serious and accomplish too much which turns into a mess of incomplete storylines and underdeveloped characters. By the end the film was dragging and I found myself waiting for it end sooner.",1395014400,,302,4.611111111111111
5907444,5,B00EE6C4NW,"this is a awesome movie. bruce willis is back in this non stop action sequel to the hit film red. this is just as good as the first movie.

5907448,4,B00EE6C4NW,"There is really not much to say except it's everything you would expect, just no Morgan Freeman. Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones are a great addition and everyone who has returned played their parts very well. If there is a Red 3, because there was a big opening for another installment. I will definitely welcome it.",1394928000,,326,4.839285714285714

5907464,2,B00EE6C4NW,"Few sequals can measure up to the original...and this falls in that catagory. Keeping in mind it as all about fun, and the cast is wonderful, it falls short of all expectations.
There seems to be no chemistry between the characters, the plot line it rediculous, and even the actors seem to be bored throughout.

5907469,4,B00EE6C4NW,"We all loved the movie Red.  A great cast with a fun and unusual storyline that included many cute unexpected twists and turns.  The sequel maintains the cast virtually as it was in the original movie.  However, the action is substantially less exciting and the humor does not come off the screen as well.

It is hard to understand why sequels seem to fall short of expectations, but they usually do.  This one did as well in that respect.  Still a good movie to watch, but nowhere near as much fun as Red.",1394496000,,506,4.387096774193548

Thought Reds 2 would be more of the same and was looking forward to a little mindless fun on a cold dreary Friday evening.  Unfortunately the mindlessness was still there, but the fun was all gone.

Does a great job of bringing back the characters you loved without rehashing the storyline or the formula, it's actually a new movie.  Again, not as many laughs as the first, a little darker and slower, but that was alright with us, as there were both more identifiable moments as well as outrageous or surprising ones.  The action scenes were fun, Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as always.",1394409600,,554,4.52

5907510,3,B00EE6C4NW,"How much you enjoy Red 2 is in my opinion tied to why you liked the first movie. I enjoyed the first Red because it was a witty comedy with a fair amount of action thrown in to keep the story moving. This movie is the opposite. There is a ton of action with a small amount of witty comedy thrown in. There are a lot of action movies out there and for me what set Red apart was the witty and enjoyable comedy. The sequel just doesn't have the same magic as the original. This is not to say that Red 2 is not an enjoyable movie, it's just more formulaic.",1393804800,,552,3.9375
5907511,4,B00EE6C4NW,This is just a fun and action packed movie with lots of laughs!  Enjoyed it more than the first one!,1393804800,,100,4.0
5907512,3,B00EE6C4NW,The first one was better. I didn't think it was as funny and a bit boring. Still love John Malkovich!!,1393804800,,102,4.15
5907513,5,B00EE6C4NW,It's very funny and it is a little on the crazy side.  All these characters work so well together.  The 2 was as good as the first one.,1393718400,,135,3.7857142857142856
5907514,3,B00EE6C4NW,"And thought it was great. But I couldn't make it all the way through this. It was just boring and I love all the stars. So I wasted 4  bucks. Actually feel asleep, never made it to the end.",1393718400,,189,3.8461538461538463
5907515,4,B00EE6C4NW,"In the world of sequels, many movies fall short of changing the storyline enough to stand on its own (e.g. copy of the first movie).  Red2 was not that at all.  However, the character uniqueness had been well established in the first movie, making the moves and action series pretty much unimpressive.  I will say this though, I was entertained.",1393718400,,345,4.716666666666667
5907516,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I love the Red and Red 2 movies.  It is exciting action and amusing at the same time. Of course, Bruce Willis is my favorite actors.  These movies were very exciting and entertaining.",1393718400,,183,4.515151515151516
5907517,5,B00EE6C4NW,This was an excellent movie that we will definitely watch again.  We like it as much as Red.  I really hope to see a Red 3.,1393718400,,123,3.6923076923076925
5907518,4,B00EE6C4NW,I do not know which movie was better Reds 1 or Red2.  How about reds3...is it on the way.  Ok,1393632000,,93,3.6
5907519,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Red 2 is hilarious and action packed. Both Bruce Willis & Helen Miren do a supurb job at entertaining us throughout the movie and John Malkavich, well what can I say?  He is fantasticly funny as they all were in ""Red"". By them both, you won't be disappointed!",1393632000,,259,4.395833333333333

5907521,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I'm a HUGE fan of the original RED, and while this one tries to recapture the spirit and fun of the first film, it really feels like a been there, done that rehash. Whereas in the first film Mary-Louise Parker's character was endearing, in this one she's really pretty annoying with her utter disregard of the danger of the situations our cast find themselves in. When she finally gets to a point where she seems genuinely afraid, it's actually quite satisfying and I found myself saying ""FINALLY!""

Worth a rental if you were a fan of the first one, but lower your expectations accordingly.",1393632000,,591,4.6826923076923075
5907522,1,B00EE6C4NW,I would not recommend this movie. It is not funny at all. We could not watch this movie to the end.,1393632000,,99,3.761904761904762
5907523,3,B00EE6C4NW,"A little disappointing: RED was much more easy to follow, and much more fun for me,
It is very complicated plot and a bit tiring.",1393632000,,129,4.2
5907524,5,B00EE6C4NW,this was a sequel that was as fun as the first movie - great cast and my husband loved the action,1393545600,,97,3.6666666666666665
5907525,4,B00EE6C4NW,This movie has a story driven plot! And that's not all!!! It also has actors portraying roles based on characters from that very plot I mentioned earlier. ALSO! This plot has a conclusion! Roll credits!,1393545600,,202,4.8

5907527,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Seriously I love these guys.  I miss Morgan Freeman, and who wouldn't?  He's amazing.  While this movie isn't as good as the first, it had me laughing and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Who doesn't want to engage in a little senior citizen humor?",1393545600,,241,4.534883720930233

5907529,5,B00EE6C4NW,An action filled but reality impossible movie with funny sidebars and character realignments that moved well and acted as pure entertainment without being a violence teacher.,1393545600,,174,5.730769230769231
5907530,5,B00EE6C4NW,it's a real good movie. you'll love it . I give it a two thumbs up . great cast members,1393545600,,87,3.4
5907531,4,B00EE6C4NW,Nice sequel to the original film.  Geezer fun with tongue in cheek.  Just get a big bag of popcorn and sit back and enjoy the movie and don't over analyze what's happening on the screen!,1393459200,,186,4.285714285714286
5907532,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Bruce and the rest of the gang return for a sequel packed with plenty of entertaining action and quality humor in RED 2! If you liked the first RED, you'll enjoy this one just as well.
The RED movies embody the most simplistic quality of a great flick ... they entertain us.
All the actors provide for a great ride (Bruce and the gang show great chemistry), the action is plentiful and the humor is right on target.  So grab some popcorn and enjoy!",1393459200,,448,4.333333333333333
5907533,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I recommend watching RED 1 & 2.  Their exciting, suspenseful and entertaining movies with complex and well developed plots and characters.  The actors are phenomenal - well, just look at the cast, all seasoned actors.  Bravo!",1393459200,,225,5.194444444444445

The first red was good and entertaining, this movie was just stupid and terrible.",1393459200,,252,4.270833333333333
5907536,1,B00EE6C4NW,"God awful!!!! Complete departure from the 1st movie. Felt like Bruce Willis was hopping across the Europe chilling with his ""buds"" and not working!! And Catherine Zeta-Jones looked like a ""bloated fish carcass"" of her former self. Putting on a tranche coat and a hat DOESN'T make you a Russian spy!!! Some acting is also required but alas that didn't take place. Every one involved in this project should be thoroughly ashamed!!! For putting out such sludge.",1393459200,,458,4.961038961038961

5907539,4,B00EE6C4NW,A good blend of action and comedy that was enjoyed by the entire family. Especially enjoyed Helen Mirren's line regarding getting the bodies from her freezer.,1393372800,,158,5.115384615384615

5907544,1,B00EE6C4NW,this was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. just not what I like. plenty of action and lots of the F word. that spoiled it for me.,1393286400,,139,3.5161290322580645
5907545,4,B00EE6C4NW,This was a fun movie. There was lots of action and a bit of comedy. Some great fighting sequences. I enjoyed it!,1393286400,,112,4.136363636363637
5907546,5,B00EE6C4NW,Most sequels don't reach the level of the original. This does. Adding actors like Anthony Hopkins certainly doesn't hurt. He was great as usual and no one can be John Malcovich except John Malcovich. If you watched RED you have to watch RED2.,1393286400,,242,4.651162790697675
5907547,5,B00EE6C4NW,I bought this movie for my daughters BF he had been asking for it for quite some time.  He really enjoyed it.,1393286400,,109,3.9545454545454546

5907549,5,B00EE6C4NW,Sometimes sequels are terribly disappointing. Not this one. They picked up right where they left off with RED and left us hoping for a RED3.,1393200000,,140,4.64

5907551,5,B00EE6C4NW,"My sisters and I were dying to watch this movie when it was in the theaters, but failed to do so. It was definitely hilarious though, even for people that didn't watch the first Red movie. The downfall of this was that it streams on silverline media which is not capable to stream on google chromecast. (As of now; this may change in the future :D - crossing fingers and toes)
You can always watch it on your laptop or with an HDMI cord though ;)",1393200000,,446,4.1976744186046515

He did a good job in 'The Whole 9 Yards' beside Matthew Perry and Michael Clark Duncan.",1393200000,,265,3.925925925925926
5907553,5,B00EE6C4NW,I admit to bias:  I would pay just to watch Helen Mirren walk across the stage and feel that I got my money's worth.  The film isl one laugh after another with a great cast and tongues stuck firmly in cheeks.  A Madcap spy action adventure.  Just don't try to take it seriously.,1393200000,,278,4.188679245283019
5907554,5,B00EE6C4NW,Loved Reds (it gets better the more times you watch it).  Reds 2 is similar in that I loved it even more the second time than the first!  Its fun and entertaining.  Enjoy!,1393200000,,171,4.121212121212121

5907557,4,B00EE6C4NW,"We watched Red 2 off the recommendation of a friend.  I hadn't known anything about the movie, which often makes me like a movie even better!  Having NOT seen the first one, it was a tad difficult to navigate the relationship between some of the characters, yet once the action picked up things solidified.  There is a great deal of action in this movie and some fun mystery and intrigue.  We enjoyed this movie, and we intend on watching the first one as well!",1393200000,,461,4.4523809523809526
5907558,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Not quite reaching the humor like the first movie.  Actors were great, just seemed like they were reaching and trying too hard for a dialogue that wasn't humorous.  Seems as if all the best highlights were pulled together for the trailer.",1393200000,,238,4.780487804878049
5907559,2,B00EE6C4NW,"I really liked Red.  Campy, funny, good action.  Red 2 didn't even come close.  Poor story line, bad directing, pointless and overdone action scenes.  Don't waste your money.",1393113600,,174,5.107142857142857

5907565,5,B00EE6C4NW,I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun loving and full of action. I would recommend it for sure. Funny,1393027200,,103,4.2
5907566,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I enjoyed this movie so much that in the short time I have owned it, I have already viewed it twice.  Mary Louise-Parker does a wonderful job in this film.  With the variety of actors, you find yourself harkening back to other roles which they have portrayed: Parker in ""Weeds,""  Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs,""  Willis in so many of these action/adventure films and Mirren in her many roles on PBS.  This is a light, humorous, action-filled ride; perfect viewing on a Saturday night when one just wants to get away from from the seriousity of the world.  Seeing Brian Cox in this film reminds one of his role in the ""Bourne"" films.  These films are all of a genre, but they occupy different sectors of that genre.",1393027200,,717,4.511627906976744
5907567,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Great movie...good ole Bruce Willis love these older actors, he always plays the tough guy that survives everything thrown at him.  It's like the third time we rented it.

5907568,5,B00EE6C4NW,"And the fun continues.  While it isn't quite the fun of the first RED, it is still wonderful!  Great characters, great actors, and, of course, a great twist!",1393027200,,157,4.571428571428571

5907590,4,B00EE6C4NW,"As with the first film, Red 2 is a fast-moving action flick with more than its fair share of snappy patter among the characters.  Once again, the charm of the series stems mostly from the perspective of older agents who have seen and done just about everything that the espionage world can throw at them and they can find the humor in it.  There are many bullets flying, but violence isn't graphic at all.  If I had a grievance (and this is more my own age than anything else) is that the soundtrack never lets up.  The music is non-stop.  And it's not *bad* music... it just became intrusive and wearying by the end of the movie and seemed to fight with the strength of the film, which is the humanity of the characters.  But that's a minor quibble, and I would certainly recommend Red 2 to even the most casual action movie fans.",1392854400,,831,4.363636363636363

This group entertains and makes a dark subject like murder and mayhem funny.

John Malkovich is priceless and Helen Mirren is a goddess! Bruce Willis is--as always--BRUCE!",1392854400,,253,4.7272727272727275

5907595,5,B00EE6C4NW,RED2 is a great follow up to the original movie RED.  It was good to see most of the cast and Sir Anthony Hopkins.,1392854400,,114,3.75

Well written, and Anthony Hopkins terrifies me no matter what character he plays.",1392768000,,259,4.711111111111111
5907598,4,B00EE6C4NW,I was a little underwhelmed by Red 2.  It is definitely a fun comedy filled action movie.  But the bar set by Red was SO HIGH that it is hard to imagine any sequel surpassing it.  I was certainly delighted by the film and would suggest it to anyone who liked the first movie.  But don't go in with too high of expectations.  Because your cruising for a let down.,1392768000,,362,4.114285714285714

5907602,2,B00EE6C4NW,"It was a funny movie with lots of action just like in the first movie. There were plenty of mini action plots throughout the whole movie that all became instantly fixed when it was time to focus on the major action plot near the end. They tried to focus on the romance throughout the movie and kinda failed in my book, it was kinda awkward truely. But maybe that's what they were aiming for..

5907616,3,B00EE6C4NW,"We had hoped to have as much fun as we did watching the first one a second time, but alas, it seems that once you've watched the joke about old spies still doing their stuff it just isn't as funny anymore. Maybe if the characters had been given a little typical old age weakness, like a bad back or a trick knee or a need to rush off to the bathroom regularly or even some forgetfulness, it would have perked up the joke and made it a little fresher. As it was, Willis, Mirren, etc. didn't seem to have any age appropriate limitations, even when engaged in combat with younger adversaries.",1392681600,,589,4.315315315315315

5907628,1,B00EE6C4NW,"When none of the original cast members can be coerced into returning for the sequel, you know you're in trouble, and so it is with this protracted and completely unnecessary follow-up to Warren Beatty's Oscar-winning original.  Why anyone thought there would be an audience for this is a question that may never be answered; also, the picture lacks the epic scope and impeccable production values that defined the first film.  Despite the low-rent trappings, Bruce Willis manages to score some points as Eugene O'Neill, but it's not enough.",1392595200,,540,5.125

5907641,3,B00EE6C4NW,Had its moments but felt that individual character quirks were less refined and persistent. Also the love arc felt unnecessary and encumbering to the interpersonal development. Enjoyed for the most part.,1392422400,,203,5.580645161290323

5907646,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I really liked the first RED. Truth be told I can barely remember what the main plot was (something about the president and vice maybe?) but I loved it because it has so much fun with its characters and used them to their fullest. I re-watch it a lot just to see John Malcovich, his ""pig"", and so many memorable moments.

A lot of that is still present though some of the characters from the first one only make cameos and, most disappointingly, Malcovich and Miren have much smaller and less fun roles this time around. Hopkins' character is some fun for a bit and Zeta-Jones is a complete waste (total miscast).

The story still doesn't really matter here. Enjoy Willis and friends being silly and actiony. Still a better Expendables than the actual Expendables.",1392336000,,764,4.651851851851852

YOU'D THINK BRUCE WILLIS COULD HAVE HAD A BETTER MOVIE IN WHICH TO STAR. I ALMOST CUT IT OFF TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE IT FINISHED CAUSE IT WAS BORING, BUT DECIDED TO WATCH THE ENTIRE MOVIE BEFORE I DECIDED ON MY FINAL OPINION.

The makers must've assumed they'd have another hit by pumping up every moment with bullets and useless chaos. No charm or reason to care about these characters, Red 1 at least had patience as far as the story goes. It's time for these agents to retire once and for all.",1392163200,,447,4.270588235294118

Very good casting.  All the main actors are very well known and excellent actors.  I enjoyed it very much and will watch it numerous times.  This is one of those movies that every time you watch it, you see something that you didn't see before.  Very entertaining.  I highly recommend this movie, but see RED first.  RED sets up the characters' backgrounds and explains things that RED2 does not.  As far as sequels go, this is one that does not disappoint.

5907675,4,B00EE6C4NW,Sent this as a gift to my husband's aunt. It was her birthday and we knew she would enjoy it.,1392076800,,93,3.7
5907676,5,B00EE6C4NW,We love both of the Red movies and have watched them more than once.  Great humor coupled with fast action...not a lot of bad lanquage.  Considerable violence but without the blood and gore.,1391990400,,190,4.7272727272727275
5907677,2,B00EE6C4NW,I was unable to down load the movie.  I was able to down load Red earlier in the week but couldn't get Red 2 to down load.,1391990400,,122,3.5185185185185186
5907678,5,B00EE6C4NW,Then you'll love this one too!! Cant get enough!  I'm so hoping they'll make #3!  Buy it! Watch it! Love it!,1391990400,,108,4.095238095238095
5907679,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Red 2, like Red, is a film that you sit back and enjoy. The humor is great and the plot is what keeps it from being 5 star. This should not deter you from watching Red 2. Mary-Louise Parker and Bruce Willis make an excellent couple. He trying to protect her and she wanting to get involved in anything dangerous. Sit back, laugh and forget for a time the news you here that ruins your day.",1391990400,,389,4.131578947368421
5907680,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I now have both movies, and a friend  of mine has asked to borrow these movies. I watched them both over this past weekend and enjoyed them both. They both have a great cast, with a few twist within. I hope they bring out another in the near future. G.Goff",1391990400,,256,4.12
5907681,4,B00EE6C4NW,"We loved RED because it was action packed but NO horrible swearing.  Can say exactly the same thing about RED 2, perhaps it was because they would come out on top, but it wasn't as exciting and on the edge of your seat sometimes....Still quite worth watching!!",1391990400,,260,4.531914893617022
5907682,5,B00EE6C4NW,Loved it! Very funny action packed awesome cast a must see for the whole family.  Would watch again and again.,1391990400,,110,4.5
5907683,5,B00EE6C4NW,The movie was great with outstanding actors playing memorable roles. Movie is action pack with many twist and turns to keep you engaged throughout.,1391990400,,147,5.166666666666667
5907684,2,B00EE6C4NW,"It's just ok... Storyline was boring, but the action was ok. The plot was just stupid and not very realistic",1391990400,,108,4.45
5907685,2,B00EE6C4NW,It was entertaining but that was about it. Very tongue and cheek with no real substance. No one took this film seriously including me.,1391990400,,134,4.625
5907686,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Great sequel to the first movie. It had us laughing and on the edge of our seats! I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially those that enjoyed the first movie!",1391904000,,171,4.548387096774194
5907687,4,B00EE6C4NW,The title really says it all... Its a good movie but you have to keep in mind its a comedy first not an action movie. If you liked the first one you will love this one as well!,1391904000,,176,3.6578947368421053
5907688,5,B00EE6C4NW,I liked the first movie so much I had to get Red #2. i'm glad I did because I liked it more.,1391904000,,92,3.227272727272727

5907690,5,B00EE6C4NW,Funny and full of action.  My kind of movie.  I will watch it over and over again. Fun for all.,1391904000,,95,3.7

5907692,5,B00EE6C4NW,"not as great as the first one, but still well worth watching. the obvious talent in the cast is just great",1391904000,,106,4.095238095238095
5907693,5,B00EE6C4NW,"excellent action and great one liners, as you would expect from this cast. Helen Mirren is awesome in her role.",1391904000,,111,4.6
5907694,2,B00EE6C4NW,They tried to turn this into an action film rather than the quirky dark comedy that made the first film.,1391904000,,104,4.25
5907695,2,B00EE6C4NW,"Take a great cast so people like me will rent/buy this.  Then waste the talent by giving them an assault rifle and hot cars.  Appeal to young people who can no longer concentrate and make the whole movie a violent kill everyone, destroy as many cars and property as possible fiasco.  This is entertaining....yes, but promotes that dangerous motivation in unstable people who can no longer tell the difference between reality and fiction.  I would love to see this cast together again in a real movie for adults!",1391904000,,511,4.7727272727272725

5907697,5,B00EE6C4NW,This was a great follow up to the original Red movie. Bruce Willis is one of a few actors than can make good follow up movies. So I hope this crazy bunch of spies will continue to have more adventures in the future. It would be hard not to like a Bruce Willis movie but I also enjoyed having an older female ALSO being one to kick butt.,1391817600,,336,3.9558823529411766
5907698,5,B00EE6C4NW,Loved the first one and the second one is just as good.  Great cast and a lot of fun to watch.,1391817600,,94,3.4761904761904763
5907699,2,B00EE6C4NW,"Enjoyed the first one more than this.  John Malkovich is always entertaining even when he isn't speaking or barely within camera range.  The rest of the cast was, of course, first rate.  But next time lose Bruce Willis.  He brings the entire movie down with his condescending ""I'm only here for the money"" attitude. The other cast members deserved better than to be forced to act around him.",1391817600,2,391,4.705882352941177
5907700,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I really enjoyed the first version of Reds better than the second. I think the characters were better defined in the first version and I felt that was more enjoyable. Not a bad movie, I just spoiled...",1391817600,2,201,4.45945945945946
5907701,5,B00EE6C4NW,this movie was good because it has a lot of action and drama witch makes it interesting to watch and keeps your attention.,1391817600,,122,4.3478260869565215

5907706,3,B00EE6C4NW,"RED (1) WAS A MASTERPIECE--FUN, ACTIVE, IMAGINATIVE.  RED2 IS GOOD, BUT NOT UP TO #1.  STILL, RE2 IS A GOOD FILM BUT MORE ON THE 'SERIOUS' SIDE THAN THE FRANTIC IMPROBABLE COMEDY/MAYHEM OF RED (1).",1391731200,,197,4.6
5907707,4,B00EE6C4NW,"This movie went the way of most sequels, it's never as good as the first one, but I like it any way because it gives a continuation of the first movie.",1391731200,,151,3.903225806451613

5907710,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Loved this movie! It didn't seem as good as the first one (maybe because dialogue was semi-predictable), but still kept me entertained. Some of the action shots were killer, though. Malkovich's character keeps this movie funny.",1391644800,,227,5.333333333333333
5907711,2,B00EE6C4NW,"I liked a couple of the sequences in this movie, but some parts were too easy to predict.  Enjoyed the first movie a quite a bit, but feel like this is a less universally-relevant movie and just cashing in on the original characters, not really adding anything new.",1391644800,,265,4.520833333333333
5907712,3,B00EE6C4NW,I don't have much to say about Red 2..It is more violent and less humorous.  I enjoyed Red much more!,1391644800,,101,4.05
5907713,4,B00EE6C4NW,"It was a good movie but it had the usual problems of an action sequel: too much action, not enough story development. Truthfully, though, we loved the first REDS and could hardly wait for REDS2.  Loved the quirky characters!",1391644800,,224,4.743589743589744

5907716,2,B00EE6C4NW,This was a prime example of a movie that should have just stuck with one.  The sequel was not anywhere near as good as the first movie.  What a waste,1391558400,,149,3.933333333333333
5907717,5,B00EE6C4NW,Movie was a hoot all the way through...The cast was perfect for the parts and the plot was excellently crafted..,1391558400,,112,4.65
5907718,5,B00EE6C4NW,Enjoy watching Bruce Willis movies.  Have seen this movie two or three times and finally just decided to buy it rather than keep renting it.,1391558400,,140,4.6
5907719,5,B00EE6C4NW,Absolutely loved the movie but had a few problems with the HD retrieving process since we rewinded a few times to see really cools scenes again.,1391558400,,144,4.576923076923077

5907721,5,B00EE6C4NW,"We greatly enjoyed Red and the sequel, Red 2, lived up to our expectations.  The sequel was witty, funny and kept our attention with (mild) suspense.  The cast are perfect and really blend well together.  Can't wait to see Red 3!",1391558400,,229,4.536585365853658

5907727,4,B00EE6C4NW,"This cast has chemistry! The action and humor never stop and left me wanting more. I've grown to love this group of washed up old has-been agents that want to hang up the towel, but just can't seem to stay retired!",1391472000,,214,4.2439024390243905
5907728,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I watched REDS and laughed my but off. It is the best Bruce Willis movie period. I just had to watch REDS 2 and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie, just don't let young children watch with you. The language is bad.",1391472000,,233,4.2
5907729,4,B00EE6C4NW,Love this cast.  Really entertaining although I think I preferred Red 1.  What I don't like is being told I haven't written enough words in the tips and guidelines section here.,1391472000,,177,4.67741935483871
5907730,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I didn't find RED 2 quite as good as the first movie, but it definitely has its moments, and I got several good laugh-out-loud moments.  Great cast, great fun.",1391472000,,159,4.482758620689655
5907731,1,B00EE6C4NW,"I actually never even notice ""Red-1"" at the movies, but got to watch it at a family gathering and I thought ""what a great and fun movie!!""... I mean, even with some of the exaggerated scenes and unbelievable stunts with Bruce Willis, I actually thought to make it even more entertaining and clever. So, when ""Red-2"" came out I was super excited! Then it felt like went through theaters like a breeze, couldn't make it but made a note to self to watch it as soon as it came into video.... To say that I felt asleep in the middle of it, didn't finish it AND didn't care had paid for it... Not sure what happened! So, if you are planning on rent it, just wait until it's available for free on TV.... It's just not worth it...",1391472000,,722,4.239130434782608

5907735,4,B00EE6C4NW,We like the actors in this story. It's a fun flick and the character chemistry is wonderful. Well worth watching.,1391385600,,113,4.7
5907736,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I actually liked it better than RED and I really liked RED also.  Having John Malkovich, Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Anthony Hopkins together is a treat in itself, but add in a great story line as well as excellent action effects and you get this gem of a film.",1391385600,,265,4.3

5907738,4,B00EE6C4NW,This is entertaining. probably one of the best #2 sequel. I really liked the first so this was a natural review.,1391385600,,112,4.380952380952381
5907739,5,B00EE6C4NW,"It's better than the first which was good but not campy enough for my taste. If you like the buddy, buddy, buddy, etc kind of movie like Ocean's Eleven then give this a try.",1391385600,,173,4.117647058823529
5907740,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I did enjoy this movie, but the humor seemed very forced and contrived at times... I mean they were going to beat that gag with ""Mary-Louise Parker having a gun"" absolutely to death.  It got old and many times, it wasn't even funny.  However, it was entertaining and still worth watching if you saw the original. The cast is amazing, I just thought the writing could have been better.  In my opinion: RED was kind of a surprise hit and the producers rushed around to get a sequel out in record time and this is what you get.  I would have taken the time to get a really good script, but that's me.",1391385600,,597,4.256637168141593
5907741,4,B00EE6C4NW,After seeing the original we were excited to see Red 2.  Great cast but just not as funny.  Still completely worth it.,1391385600,,118,4.318181818181818

5907745,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Funny, entertaining, good opting for a sunday night. I liked the actors, and even though the storyline is not that great, seeing all these guys in an action/comedy is fun. Good clean dialogs and jokes.",1391299200,,201,4.771428571428571
5907746,4,B00EE6C4NW,"This was a fun, exciting and funny movie. The action sequences paired with the humor was captivating and entertaining. It was filled with excitement, but the humor kept it from being too intense.",1391299200,,195,4.9393939393939394
5907747,4,B00EE6C4NW,Good movie and funny as hell but not exceed R ed one. Most sequels seem not to hold a candle to the orig inal movie.,1391299200,,116,3.68
5907748,4,B00EE6C4NW,"We watched Red and loved it, we enjoyed this one as well. Very easy to order on my Roku, much better than going to the movies or renting from a video store--and of course, no commercials! lol",1391299200,,191,4.1891891891891895

5907750,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Every bit as good as the original! Just like Red, this movie finds the perfect mix of action, suspense, humor, romance, and charm. Bruce Willis, MLP, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren all return in great form for the sequel, and while more Bryan Cox would've been nice, the addition of Neal McDonough, Byung-Hun Lee, and especially Anthony Hopkins more than make up for that. If you're a fan of the first movie and were afraid this sequel wouldn't hold up, lay your fears to rest.

5907754,5,B00EE6C4NW,RED caught me by surprise -- I knew I would like it because of the wonderful cast but I had no idea how extraordinarily wonderful they would be when they worked together.  And RED2 is just as much fun as the original -- anybody who bought RED should also buy RED2!,1391299200,,264,4.176470588235294
5907755,4,B00EE6C4NW,I am not sure that this movie isn't actually a spoof of spy films. What ever it is it is worth a watch for good performances from lots of aging stars,1391299200,,149,3.838709677419355

5907759,5,B00EE6C4NW,What a hoot.  Loved it as much as Red.  Totally fooled us with Marvin blowing up and the funeral scene with Frank and Sarah was hilarious.  Victoria is great.  It's seldom that a sequel hits the mark; but this one did.,1391212800,,218,4.2439024390243905

I couldn't wait to see it, but I have to say it was a let down.  The pros:  John Malkovich and Helen Mirren were very entertaining.  I wish they would have a spin off movie with these two characters.  The cons:  No real high, no real low, just more of the same with nothing new or interesting.",1391212800,,452,4.056818181818182

Catherine Zeta-Jones makes a wonderful Russian spy chief.  Helen Mirren plays a quiet, demure little lady who just happens to have a talent for killing people.  Her response, ""From my freezer"" (when asked where she got the bodies to put in the truck) is a classic.

Just look at the Expendables where Sylvester Stallone looks like he's one step away from a stroke and Arnold Schwarzenegger looks like he's wearing Depends.  In the case of the first movie in this series, Retired, Extremely Dangerous was actually a good laugh.  Bunch of old spooks, proving they still have what it takes.  They are all a bit nutty but that and Bruce Willis' kidnap/romance make it all the less likely and more humorous.  And that's about where they should have stopped.  But, some screenwriter in Hollywood convinced some producer who convinced some director that more yucks could be milked out of this storyline.

5907809,4,B00EE6C4NW,I think it could have been better - probably had to do with direction because all the actors are heavy hitters and among my absolute favorites.  It was funny but you wanted to be dazzled by an exciting ending that did not happen - somewhat disappointed.,1390867200,,253,4.5
5907810,4,B00EE6C4NW,A good follow up to RED. It was well worth the effort to wait for it to be on Prime.,1390867200,,84,3.25

Our TV is fairly loud and the volume us usually set to around 7, but we had to crank it up to over 90 to be able to hear most the dialog in this movie. It's not that the dialog is just so much quieter than the explosions, etc. (as is often the case in movies). I have not had this problem with any other Amazon Instant Videos in the past, so I'm sure this is an exception.",1390867200,,459,3.946236559139785

I can no longer take his films seriously and enjoy them. He and all the characters in Red 2 try too hard to be funny in one way or another. Well, it's not funny. It's also not fun and adventureous because they don't let you take any of it seriously.  BTW, that bald/shaved head of his is really getting to me.

5907896,4,B00EE6C4NW,Very funny. Great movie to watch with your parents. Bruce Willis is great. Malcovich was just as funny as the first one.,1390262400,,120,4.5
5907897,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Entertaining action film with a story line, but boiler plate for quick sale at theaters and dvd stores.  I always enjoy watching John Malkovich in his paranoid character roles for the comedic twist.  Helen Mirren is always the glamorous assassin in spite of being one of the ""boys"".  Bruce Willis courageous and calm in the face of bullets whizing by and exploding bombs while at the same time taking time outs to kiss the love interest.  Entertaining, but.........",1390262400,,465,4.923076923076923

5907899,5,B00EE6C4NW,Bruce Willis at his best by far. The best action movie since The Avenger's.  Anthony Hopkins pull off a great performance too.,1390262400,,126,4.7272727272727275

Thrilling, exciting, full of suspense, loads of humor and kept me on the edge of my seat. Never a dull moment.",1390176000,,413,4.52

Action comes so fast that you have to look at the movie at least 4 or 5 times to catch what is really going on and how it relates to prior scenes.

5907978,5,B00EE6C4NW,"THEYRE BACK  that band of senior secret agents known as RED: Retired, Extremely Dangerous. The second outing has Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and civilian girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), paranoid Marvin (John Malkovich) and the lady James Bond, Victoria (Helen Mirren) out to track down a small nuclear device invented by crazed scientist Bailey (Anthony Hopkins).

Never underestimate AARP (MI5 agent Victoria is surely an honorary member.)

Hopkins is new to the cast as is Catherine Zeta-Jones as Katja, a Russian spy and Franks former flame; Korean star Byung-hun Lee as Han Cho Bai, Franks ongoing frenemy.

Shake em all up and weve got another fun blend of espionage, superhero action and humor. The stunts are terrific; John McClane would be impressed.

The plot is nonsensical; an excuse to get these characters together and let them do what they do so well. Frank Moses is on a hit list. Again. We find him in Costco, shopping to set up house with Sarah, when Marvin appears with a warning. Frank is a nonbeliever, but events ensue to convince him hes become a target  especially after old friend Victoria, the cool and collected assassin, calls to say shes been offered a contract on him.

Screenwriters Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber, who collaborated on the original Red and are signed up for Red 3, share their enthusiasm in The Red 2 Experience, a multi-part making-of feature, which is exclusive to Blu-ray. Sections on The Cast, The Weapons, The Spy Gear and Tactics, and The Stunts are more entertaining than detailed. But this is information weve all seen before; the kick comes from seeing the good time everyone looks to be having.

Four deleted scenes are short, but don't add to the film. A gag reel doesnt bring much in the way of laughs either; we get those from the movie.",1389830400,,1799,4.856209150326797

5908030,3,B00EE6C4NW,We really enjoyed the first movie. Didn't enjoy the 2nd as well. We liked the interaction among the characters in the first one. This one seems to rely more on the gimmicks.,1389657600,,173,4.4375

5908047,4,B00EE6C4NW,This second movie is enjoyable and you will have a lot of laughs. If you liked Red you will also like Red 2.,1389657600,,108,3.739130434782609
5908048,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Fun fluff.  Good for what it is, fun action sequences, macabre humor, fun and interesting characters.  It does help to be familiar with the first movie.",1389657600,,152,4.8076923076923075
5908049,4,B00EE6C4NW,"This movie is good, has a good cast, more tough-guy action and a hot Catherine Zeta Jones, but I still like Red 1 the best.",1389657600,,123,3.96

5908054,4,B00EE6C4NW,"After enjoying the first Red movie, I looked forward to seeing Red 2.  I was not disappointed!  As always with Bruce Willis and other great cast members, the movie was fun and exciting!  I was looking for something adventurous to watch and this was the perfect combination of action along with comedy.",1389657600,,301,4.75

5908067,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I only bought this because I enjoyed the first one so much. Again this is just a fun escape movie with some unbelievable (I believe Myth Busters proved one of the scenes in RED was physically impossible) fight scenes, but overall for me this is fun.",1389571200,,249,4.434782608695652
5908068,5,B00EE6C4NW,It was entertaining and fun!  I loved how Bruce Willis and John Malkovich play off each other. A good sequel.,1389571200,,109,4.45

5908070,3,B00EE6C4NW,It is funny but it seemed disjointed and forced.  Great actors but the scripted was poor.  Maybe the next installment will be better written and edited.,1389571200,,152,4.8076923076923075
5908071,5,B00EE6C4NW,"True chewing gum for the eyeballs. Entertaining, fun. No deep meanings; soul searching; tear jerking; messaging. Just good clean mayhem, decent plot (unreal), and violence!! Better than a video game!!
Willis et. al. are not over the hill; Malcovich's character is an added treat.
I own Reds also.
I only keep the ""keepers"" in my library and this one.",1389571200,,350,4.9491525423728815

5908074,4,B00EE6C4NW,Just about as good as the first one.  Great plot with lots of twists and subtle humor.  All the actors were fun to see together with lots of action and comedy,1389571200,,158,4.064516129032258
5908075,4,B00EE6C4NW,I still love it!  Bruce Willis has never been so awesome and Helen Mirren is my idol.  One of the few movies I could watch more than once.,1389484800,,138,3.892857142857143
5908076,5,B00EE6C4NW,Good clean fun fast and funny! Will most definitely watch it again and again and again and again and again.,1389484800,,107,4.4

5908078,3,B00EE6C4NW,"While the first RED was a fun trip down 1980s action movie lane, this second installment is lacking in pace.
It could have been just as good as the first, but for some reason it was not captivating, not thrilling and overall
just adequate to watch once.

Stick with RED #1.",1389484800,,273,4.352941176470588

5908081,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Excellent action movie.  All the stars were first rate.  Helen Mirren never looked better than when she was behind that .50 caliber machinegun.  I have already watched this movie several times.  I have never seen Mary-Louise Parker in a movie before, but she fit in perfectly with the rest of the A-list actors.",1389484800,,311,4.811320754716981

 we would recommend it. red would be a 5 star.",1389484800,,152,4.0
5908084,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Same story recycled?  Hardly!  Basically, you trade out Anthony Hopkins for Morgan Freeman, as far as actors go, and you still get a can't miss evening of entertainment!",1389484800,,169,5.0
5908085,4,B00EE6C4NW,and I thought the first was pretty good. I would recommend the movie to anyone who likes action movies.. really,1389484800,,111,4.6
5908086,1,B00EE6C4NW,"I liked the 1st RED but this one...yuck!  It was so segmented that you couldn't really follow it. It just didn't flow--very choppy.  And almost random---here's Catherine Zeta Jones and now she's dead, we're in London now we're not...oh wait we are back in England, we're in Russia now, etc.",1389484800,,290,4.78
5908087,5,B00EE6C4NW,"If you saw Red 1, you will absolutely love this sequel.  Many of the same characters are involved along with a few new ones.  The story is action packed and makes many twists before coming to a surprise ending!!

The two hours that this movie runs went by in absolutely no time!!  The extra features that are included in this Blu-ray are great!!

If you never saw Red 1, this is still a great movie and actually stands on its own!  While I think it is a lot more fun if you have seen Red 1 first, do not hesitate to get this movie if you had not seen the original movie first!

I would highly recommend this movie.",1389484800,,614,4.109243697478991
5908088,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I'm a Bruce Willis fan and really liked the first RED movie.  This one is just as good and interesting.  It kept my attention the whole way and had an interesting twist.  Lots of actions, things blowing up and great character interaction.",1389398400,,238,4.619047619047619
5908089,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I really love this one. There are some really great lines, lots of action, some laughs and I cannot tell you how much I enjoy watching Helen Mirren KICK ASS! It's pure entertainment and doesn't try to be anything else.",1389398400,,218,4.475

5908091,5,B00EE6C4NW,I enjoyed Red and decided to rent Red 2. I enjoyed watching both of them. I like renting the Amazon Prime movies,1389398400,,112,4.136363636363637
5908092,5,B00EE6C4NW,The group is off again on a new adventure and it is as tight and well played as the first one.  Suspend credibility when you watch it and you will have a great time.  Hope they do more of these.,1389398400,,194,3.825

5908106,5,B00EE6C4NW,If you loved Red. You will love Red 2. What a great cast of actors and actresses. Get a copy for your home collection.,1389398400,,118,3.9583333333333335
5908107,5,B00EE6C4NW,"This is obviously a follow-on to the original Red with many of the same cast members, but adding Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Mary-Louise Parker.  Red and Red 2 are similar in concept to the action movies with older casts, such as Expendables and also reaching back to Space Cowboys.  This is an action comedy involving a group of active and ""retired"" international assassins trying to kill one of their own and find a bomb as well.  The plot, which is more of a romp through London and Paris, revolves around an ensemble of very likeable characters with some very funny toss-off lines.  Lots of action (gunfire, chase scenes, and did I say gunfire?)  and lots of very good special effects with help from IL&M.  Anthony Hopkins delivered (as usual) a very high quality performance as one of the more serious characters in the ensemble.  Helen Mirren was also excellent and deadpan funny again in her role.  John Malkovich was entertaining again in his crazy character role.  Overall, very enjoyable actors, enjoyable characters and a fun action film.",1389398400,,1063,4.926966292134831
5908108,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Not as good as RED.  Several funny scenes, but kind of went overboard with trying to be funny so storyline got very cheesy.  Would have been better to back off the comedy, there was actually an interesting storyline, but it got lost.",1389398400,,233,4.523809523809524
5908109,4,B00EE6C4NW,Found this movie just as enjoyable as the first one. I love watching Helen Miren been watching her since she was on pbs in suspect she is very good as an actress and I am glad 6to see more of her the others were just as good to watch.,1389398400,,234,3.795918367346939

5908114,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Just as in the original movie, John Malkovich steals the show.  The action is non-stop, the fun is non-stop and it's worth the price of this movie just to watch the different facial gyrations that Malkovich portrays for his character.  Highly recommended.",1389312000,,255,5.0476190476190474
5908125,4,B00EE6C4NW,It is really entertaining - thanks to Bruce Willis' wit!! The story is good and the action is extreme throughout the film.,1389312000,,122,4.590909090909091
5908126,4,B00EE6C4NW,great follow up to Red. It is rare that the sequel is as good as the original. Both were great fun.,1389312000,,99,3.761904761904762

5908134,5,B00EE6C4NW,"My husband and I are older adults but not too old to appreciate this movie. Helen is so great in her part. Lots of great actors/actresses. The plot was as crazy as the first movie and if you are willing to overlook the impossibility of the events and a few silly things that don't make sense, this movie is a joy to watch. The movie moves along fast enough that you don't have time to think about those until the second or third time it is watched.  I have never been a huge fan of the actress chosen as the love interest of Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) but they do pull it off even though the chemistry really isn't there. Or maybe I am just jealous... Given those caveats this movie is a lot of fun with lots of action and plot twists. Definitely worth the money to watch and own. But there is gratuitous violence and a tendency to paint Government as the bad guys. We had no problem watching the movie on amazon prime on the TV or over wifi on a tablet.",1389225600,,954,4.1567567567567565

Bruce Willis playing his usual Die Hard Persona for laughs is taking care of his would be homicidal love interest Mary-Louise Parker.  It should be noted that she loses her new shiny Walther the first time she uses it.  Helen Mirren still smoking hot at her age when asked where she got the bodies replies ""from my freezer.""  Anthony Hopkins is a droll madman with a bomb and John Malkovish is the same conspiracy theorist as in the first movie.  Catherine Zeta Jones makes an elegant soviet agent and competition for Parker.  It's all improbable but it moves along looks good in Blue-ray.  What's not to like.  Regards,",1389225600,,714,4.656

Please suspend belief in the goings on here and just kick back to enjoy this film.  I loved the various characters, many in continuing roles, as retired spies that can't seem stay out of trouble.  Lots of violence here as in the first film, and the light-hearted approach to it all may leave some viewers turned off.  It's basically a spoof on many genres of films, so one can't take it seriously.  Includes lots of interesting locals around the world.  Bruce Willis is having fun here, not trying to win any Oscars with his performance.",1389225600,,656,4.612068965517241

OK, it's not Academy Award material... But this cast is superb and just plain fun to watch. The story is not as original as its predecessor but it kept me interested and has some great unexpected twists. The blend of action, comedy and pacing are solid and kept me engaged throughout the entire movie. This one was much funnier than the first RED but maintained the edgy feel that I enjoyed in the original.

Byung Hun Lee is the new Bruce Lee & of course Anthony Hopkins was great with a slight comic edge. Interesting soft side to Bruce Willis towards Mary Louise Parker. All around great entertainment worth the $$ to buy.",1388966400,,480,4.172043010752688
5908218,4,B00EE6C4NW,"The first ""Red"" movie is one of my favorite movies.  It wasn't anything groundbreaking or original and the plot was somewhat convoluted and hazy, but it was still a roaring good time nonetheless, featuring a good mix of action/adventure, humor, and even a bit of romance that was sweet without being sappy or mushy.  A solid cast of stars and good writing certainly helped, and it seemed that everyone involved -- Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Richard Dreyfuss -- was having just as much fun as the audience.  So I was eager to see what a sequel would have in store.

As is the case with so many other sequels, I found ""Red 2"" wasn't quite as good as the first movie.  But it's still a fun film, and worth watching if you loved the first.

Sarah and Frank (Mary-Louise Parker and Bruce Willis) are trying to settle into a peaceful civilian life together... but Frank's CIA past comes back to bite him when the paranoid lunatic Marvin (John Malkovich) tries to warn them of impending danger.  One car bomb later, Frank goes about rounding up the surviving members of the old team, including the elegant assassin Victoria (Helen Mirren) and the lovestruck Russian informant Ivan (Brian Cox), as well as femme fatale Katya (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a familiar face from his past.  The gang learns that they're being framed for the theft of a powerful nuclear device, and to clear their names they have to find said device and the scientist who developed it (Anthony Hopkins).  But not all is what it seems to be in this mission, and who's an ally and who's a foe turns out to be not so clear...

One thing this movie does better than its predecessor is the plot -- it's actually fairly coherent, if not exactly original.  The first ""Red"" movie's main flaw was that the plot was convoluted and often got lost amid the explosions and gunfights, whereas ""Red 2"" has a plot that manages to stay clear despite various double-crosses and subplots that crop up throughout.  And the actors still appear to be enjoying themselves -- even newcomers Zeta-Jones and Hopkins seem to understand exactly what kind of movie they're in, and play their roles deliciously over-the-top.  The one exception is Byung-hun Lee, who plays his role as an assassin with a grudge against Frank fairly straight throughout -- though his maniacally cackling scene with a machine gun lets him cut loose a bit.

The new additions to the cast, however, don't gel as well with the returning cast members.  Zeta-Jones felt superfluous in the film, little more than eye candy and a means of causing friction between Frank and Sarah, and her character is pretty superfluous.  Likewise, Lee and Hopkins don't quite fit in with the rest of the cast, and feel oddly out of place among the returning cast members.  This is only to be expected, I suppose, seeing as most viewers grew to love Frank's gang and any newcomers are going to have a hard time winning the hearts of the audience as easily.  I rather missed Joe's presence in the film as well, though having him suddenly come back from the dead to join the rest of the cast would have been impossible to pull off believably.

All that said, however, ""Red 2"" is still a lot of fun.  Like the first film, it deftly balances thrilling action sequences and wicked humor, and knows full well that it's not a serious film but a madcap adventure.  And as far as sequels go, it's still a decent film -- not a masterpiece and possibly a step down from the first film, but still fun and well-done.

Worth a look if you enjoyed the first movie, or if you just want a good mix of action and comedy that doesn't take itself seriously and has an excellent cast to support it.",1388966400,,3705,4.615853658536586

5908243,4,B00EE6C4NW,It was entertaining. Liked seeing my favorite people still doing action. You need to see the first one to understand it. Both were enjoyable to watch.,1388880000,,150,4.8076923076923075

And RED 2 joins them. It has its serious moments, as well as its comedic, action, and witty ones, along with Bruce Willis trademark bloody face and Matrix-esque camera tricks such as Bruce getting into a car as it is sliding sideways. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, or that needs saying, other than if you liked RED, this is maybe just a little bit better, and if you haven't seen the original, buy it along with RED 2, you will not be sorry.",1388793600,,646,4.015503875968992

5908271,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Laughed throughout.  It is what you go to the movies for, to get away from reality for a while.  John Malkovic is hilarious!

Rent it you will not be sorry.",1388793600,,156,4.133333333333334
5908272,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Very fun and action packed!. It combines espionage with humor and avoids sappy romance. Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Mary Louise-Parker at their finest! This one was every bit as good as t! he first one",1388793600,,220,4.815789473684211

5908274,2,B00EE6C4NW,"Far fetched but funny. RED was a decent movie, and as a sequel RED 2 would appeal to adolescent boys.",1388793600,,101,4.1
5908275,1,B00EE6C4NW,My expectations were high based on the original film.  This was nothing like it and dragged quite a bit.  Perhaps if I hadn't seen the first one I would appreciate this more.,1388793600,,174,4.40625
5908276,4,B00EE6C4NW,We liked it very much but it was not as good as RED. RED 2 did not have as good a story line. MLM,1388793600,,97,3.0833333333333335

5908278,5,B00EE6C4NW,The key characters are back and the crazy ex-spy humor is even funnier and engaging this go-around.  Catherine Zeta Jones and Anthony Hopkins give really good performances.  These over-the-top spy/adventure flicks are really entertaining.,1388793600,,238,5.970588235294118
5908279,4,B00EE6C4NW,Malkovich and Willis make a great pair. Supporting cast superb. Good sequelt to Reds 1. Willis is an endearing character and so is Mary Louis Parker. Good movie enjoyed it would recommend.,1388793600,,188,4.90625

5908281,3,B00EE6C4NW,I think Red was better but Red 2 is worth a watch.  All of us agree that Helen Mirren is by far the best character.,1388707200,,115,3.6

Rent Red and  only watch the trailer for Red 2. You would have maxed out on the entertainment value of both pictures without having to serve the time.",1388707200,,178,4.393939393939394

5908287,4,B00EE6C4NW,Bruce Willis is really all you have to say about movies.  He is a decent actor and does a great job playing action characters who still have a sense of humor.  I saw this at the movie theatre and couldn't wait to purchase it.  It even convince me that I needed to go back and watch the first one.  I liked 2 enough that I didn't bother to test out 1 before buying it.  They are both worth owning and watching over and over again.,1388707200,,429,4.0
5908288,3,B00EE6C4NW,"A Sequel starts in a disadvantage, and in rare cases does it build on, or improve from the prequel. So, that is why this is standard, prequel was good, sequel not so much.  It was underwhelming, though it had an ingenious plot with a great Anthony Hopkins. Had some good action scenes, and some good twists, but again there was this sensation of ... ""mmmm ok"" at the end of this one versus the ""man, that was a great movie, I'm gonna buy it"" that the first one left you with. I'd give it 3.5 if I could as it is between ""OK"" and ""Like"".",1388707200,,536,4.104761904761904

5908290,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Good action, good characters, decent comedy at points.

Only downside,

It's done almost episodically, they go to one ""set"" (Moscow for example), have a story ""sequence"", then move on to the next place.

And I'll grant it's all logical and each ""episode"" is fun and progresses the plot.

BUT, after the first few of them... well, the pace just gets a bit tiring to me.

Almost a break it into two parts, and view it that way to really enjoy it without getting burnt out in it.",1388707200,,476,4.425287356321839
5908291,4,B00EE6C4NW,Red 2 is as good as the first one. Bruce Willis worries about his girlfriend a little too much; but the mix of action and comedy shines through and I could see the franchise continuing. It's good to see the oldersters getting together for their kind of adventure. I'll be awaiting the 3rd installment.,1388707200,,301,4.592592592592593
5908292,5,B00EE6C4NW,Red and Red 2  are among the funniest movies.  We've watched them over and over and can't stop laughing.  Terrific cast and great script.,1388707200,,137,4.625

5908295,5,B00EE6C4NW,Reds 2 is just as good as Reds and funny as ever.  These are the type of movies you need to put yourself in a good mood when the day has treated you like crap!,1388707200,,159,3.5428571428571427

5908297,5,B00EE6C4NW,Another high action movie.  It continues with the same lovable characters as in the original RED movie.  What can I say... it is a Bruce Willis movie.,1388707200,,150,4.518518518518518

A lot more killing and all in all I won't watch Red 2 again.  Red, I will watch again!!!",1388707200,,214,3.840909090909091
5908300,2,B00EE6C4NW,"I had heard how much better this was compared to RED, the first. I bought it as I loved RED. I was disappointed as it didn't keep my interest. I still haven't watched it all, I got bored. So, maybe where I stopped, in fairness to the movie, maybe that's where it started getting good, near the end. Lol. Idk. I like the cast of actors, that can get me through it, I like movies that I don't have to think to much, just escape, but must still keep me interested. As I do find it fun to try to guess what's going to happen, the end, twists, in other movies, but not with this type of film, it's just to escape, few laughs, then back to the real world. Recommend? If you did like RED the first one, if you can find it at a good price, then sure. Maybe rent it first. It just wasn't what I was expecting after the first being so fun. I have never read the comics that this movie based, so I'm just a reg.person, no background on the movies, but do enjoy. Mostly # 1.",1388707200,,962,3.989637305699482
5908301,5,B00EE6C4NW,The movie Red 2 was full of action and comedy at the same time.  It would appeal to almost anyone at any age as I did not recall any bad language.  I loved Red and was eager to see Red 2 when it became available on DVD.  I recommend it to anyone.,1388707200,,246,3.6923076923076925

5908304,3,B00EE6C4NW,Cute characterless star packed fun.  Hellen Mirren steals every scene she's in.  What if they had a writer too?  Hmmm.,1388707200,,118,4.8
5908305,5,B00EE6C4NW,Good sequel...the addition of the new characters gave a lot to the movie and the original case was top notch just like the first one...Malkovich is a hoot!,1388707200,,155,4.571428571428571

5908332,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Like Red, this provides some good laughs from a stellar cast. As a sequel, it mainly suffers because we aren't surprised by the characters. But half way through I did something I never do, which is stop to read the MPAA ratings guide, because I couldn't believe it was rated PG13. There is of course wholesale slaughter as well as murder of characters central to the story. There are the more intimate moments, such when Victoria pours acid on bodies in her bathtub, or Han murders someone. If you're wondering if you should sit down on couch with your 10, 12 or 14 year old, look for something else. I'm glad my kids missed it.",1388620800,,628,4.469565217391304

This sequle to Red has a great story plot...the story is funny and has lots of action. If you are not into violent movies, then I suggest not watching this movie.

It has a great cast and all play the rolls very well.

If you like action packed movies with a humorous side, then I strongly suggest this movie!",1388448000,,550,4.372549019607843
5908376,4,B00EE6C4NW,"If you saw the movie RED then you know the amount of fun there was to be had in the story of a retired CIA agent designated as RED or Retired Extremely Dangerous. Bruce Willis in the title role of Frank Moses carried the part of with perfection as did his fantastic supporting cast. With the exception of Morgan Freeman they all return for this sequel that, like most sequels, doesn't quite live up to the original but still offers a good night at the movies.

This time around Moses and his now girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) are settling into being a mundane average couple which he relishes but bores her to tears. One day at Costco they're approached by ex-spy Marvin (John Malkovich) who tells them he needs their help. Not wanting to put Sarah into harms way Frank turns him down only to see him blown up moments later.

But Frank isn't convinced that he's actually been killed and rightly so. When a group of agents captures Frank for an interrogation it is Marvin who rescues him. Not long after their friend Victoria (Helen Mirren) calls to let them know that MI-6 has given her a contract to kill her and the US has given the same contract to old foe Han (Byung-hun Lee). On the road the threesome do their own form of interrogation and discover that an old project they were involved in back in the seventies has spy agencies all over trying to track them down. Word has leaked they know something they don't and now the only way to survive is to find that information.

Their search takes them around the world beginning in Paris where they run into Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones). A top Russian spy she was often the weakness that Frank fell for. Whether she is there to help or hinder the group slowly unveils itself. In any event she puts Frank and Sarah at odds as any old flame would if she suddenly showed.

Eventually the group discovers that the project they were a part of involved a nuclear device that was smuggled in to Russia during the Cold War. Now it seems someone is trying to track down the device and activate it or at least take possession of it to use elsewhere. Just who is behind it all gets confusing at times and the end result isn't something you see coming at first.

Included this time around is Anthony Hopkins as Bailey, the weapons designer who created the bomb in the first place. His character offers some comic relief as he seems to be either out of his mind or heavily drugged by his captors. Either way he gives a new character some life that is up to the standards set by the rest of the cast.

While the movie offers less reality and tends to offer action along the lines of it's original format (i.e. a comic book), it doesn't matter. What it offers is spectacular entertainment from start to finish. The only thing that slows this film down is the constant jump from one country to another but each country they visit offers more obstacles to overcome which they do in grand scale.

There isn't a bad performance in this film. Standing out is Malkovich as Marvin. Malkovich is known more for his performance in heavier material but does a tremendous job being the comic foil to Willis' hard knocks hero. The only thing I was disappointed in was the parts offered Miller and Mirren. Both seem underused here but then maybe that's just my perspective.

All in all this is a fun movie that you can enjoy with a big bowl of popcorn. Just sit back and go for the ride, have some fun. I'm not sure yet if I would qualify this one to sit on the shelf in my collection but it is well worth watching.",1388448000,,3548,4.430981595092025

5908402,5,B00EE6C4NW,This was a gift to my husband because we liked the 1st one so much.  The Red2 exceeded out expectations and we just loved it!!!!,1388361600,,128,4.12
5908403,5,B00EE6C4NW,"loved the first movie, and this sequel was great.  the actors/actresses do a good job and left me in stitches.  the one liners were thought out, and the cast worked well together.  i did not buy this, but rented instead.  I suggest saving the extra dollar and rent the standard and not the hd.  if your wifi connection slows down it will cause glitches.",1388361600,,353,4.453125
5908404,3,B00EE6C4NW,"not as good as original, moved slowly and could easily have knocked off at least 1/2 hour.  I bought the first one on dvd, probably won't buy this one.",1388361600,,151,4.206896551724138
5908405,4,B00EE6C4NW,Funny movie with lots of action.  We have the first one and had to have the second one so we can marathon anytime we like.,1388361600,,122,3.88
5908406,2,B00EE6C4NW,This secuel is just a poor repeat of RED...nothing to get exceited about  If you had just placed a 2 on the original it would have been better,1388361600,,142,4.071428571428571
5908407,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Loved the sequal. Good action, fairly clean humor. Just goes to show you can have a good movie without all the nasty crap hollywood thinks sells movies.",1388361600,,152,4.666666666666667

I thought Amazon was a legitimate retailer,  They took my legitimate money.,",1388361600,,276,4.5
5908409,3,B00EE6C4NW,I loved Red 1. However Red 2 lacks pretty much everything.  Please don't try to make Red 3.  Wouldn't watch it again.,1388361600,,117,4.2727272727272725
5908410,3,B00EE6C4NW,"We loved RED so we were looking forward to seeing RED 2. When we finally had a chance to sit down and watch it, we were both very quiet through the whole movie. Yes, there are funny parts. Yes, there are good plot twists. Yes, the characters are still fun. However, the overall movie kinda feels like it is pieces parts of more than one movie thrown together. The ending seems almost anti-climactic. But then I find myself smile over a scene or two and chuckling about parts. So it feels almost like I didn't enjoy it, but just not quite. I had to rate it with 3 stars because it left me feeling too conflicted.",1388361600,,611,4.275862068965517

5908414,3,B00EE6C4NW,"While I really enjoyed RED, this one wasn't as much fun.  More action and they seemed to try to add the one-liners, it just didn't work.  Maybe we just had high expectations from the original.",1388361600,,192,4.457142857142857

5908416,4,B00EE6C4NW,The movie was pretty good but I wish it had less cursing in it. The first Red did not have this much language in it. Still a good movie though.,1388361600,,143,3.8

Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker have good chemistry. Worth the watch when there is nothing else you want to do but lounge.",1388275200,,264,4.196078431372549
5908425,1,B00EE6C4NW,How sad.  Stupid fighting and shooting in place of writing.  Phenomenal waste of great talent.  There should be a law against sequels.,1388275200,,134,5.0
5908426,4,B00EE6C4NW,"This is a good sequel to the original.  If you like original you should enjoy this one too.  I usually hesitate to watch a Bruce Willis films since his films seem to be getting worse all of the time, this one wasn't too bad.",1388275200,,224,4.068181818181818

5908431,5,B00EE6C4NW,Loved the first Red and the second one is as good.  Miss Ernest Borgnine in this one but think he would be proud of it too.  Lots of titles out there to choose from but it you like action and good action movies this is one you need to watch,1388275200,,240,3.78

5908433,3,B00EE6C4NW,"A sequel rarely lives up to the original that spawned it, and ""2"" is no exception. Three things make it watchable at all. One is the cast. Failure to thrill cannot be put on such esteemed actors. Another is, of course, the action scenes. Thirdly, and most importantly, is that having seen the first film, the characters have already been established and so it is easier to get right into the weak plot. Decent watch that doesn't require much brainpower.",1388275200,,453,4.675

5908437,3,B00EE6C4NW,A sequel which feels like a sequel. Much of the fun and surprise of the first film is missing here. Good thing the actors are good otherwise it would be a very flat movie.,1388275200,,171,4.0588235294117645

5908453,5,B00EE6C4NW,I laughed throughout the whole movie.  I love the characters and how they are portrayed.  Great actors have joined this one and deffinitely do it justice.  It's in our library.,1388188800,,176,4.8

5908455,5,B00EE6C4NW,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  We both enjoyed it very much.  the movie is funny and has alot of action and of course Bruce Willis.  Several great actors in this movie.  We enjoy it mainly because we are around the same age group as the characters, and they prove age really doesn't matter. And you just do not know what people are capable of.  If you saw the first Red, you definately need to see this one too.",1388188800,,423,4.172839506172839

5908459,1,B00EE6C4NW,"Just reviewing the movie content, I would give this four stars- very entertaining and love the cast.  The fact that the blu ray wouldn't load or play is unacceptable, and I find I'm not the only one to deal with this problem.  This was a Christmas gift for my husband and a major disappointment to have to now wait for the replacement to be sent before he can even enjoy it. Whatever happened to quality control? Good customer service is nice and all, but how about fixing the problem to begin with to save the consumer the hassle.",1388188800,2,531,4.408163265306122

5908465,5,B00EE6C4NW,"A lot of gun fire, but should know that from the first movie. Some comedy and violence but thoroughly enjoyable. If you like action with a slight comedic twist it's worth watching.",1388188800,,180,4.65625

5908469,3,B00EE6C4NW,"If you loved the first REDS, you will probably like this squel, but that will probably be about it.....like.

Basically same premise, retired CIA who are bored in their retirement and get caught up in another bad-guy scenario to show that are better than their younger counter-parts.

Same old, same old, but the characters are great and Mary Louise Parker has a much better and funnier role in this movie.",1388188800,,406,4.785714285714286
5908470,4,B00EE6C4NW,My favorites in this film are Helen Mirren and John Malkovich.  The assassin trying to get Moses while Moses is trying to get someone else is kind of tedious until ties in at the end and gives fuel to some good jokes.  Not as good as the first but still funny.,1388188800,,260,4.078431372549019
5908471,5,B00EE6C4NW,This is the second in the Red seies. The by play and action were great. I enjoyed the entertainment and felt I got my money's worth,1388188800,,131,4.076923076923077

5908473,5,B00EE6C4NW,I loved everyone in this movie. I saw the original & knew I would buy the sequel even after just seeing the previews. I actually think I like this better than the original. They only thing I wish is that they wouldn't have killed off Morgan Freeman in the first.,1388188800,,262,4.26
5908474,5,B00EE6C4NW,An amazing sequel with an amazing cast! There is a lot of non stop action and comedy in this movie!,1388102400,,99,4.0
5908475,5,B00EE6C4NW,I was thinking about how good the first Red movie was and was hoping the sequel would not be disappointing. It certainly did not disappoint as so many sequels do. It's definitely a keeper. I loved the scene when Catherine Zeta Jones drives up and does the donut turn for Bruce Willis to slide into the driver's seat. Every bit as good as the similar scene in the first movie. Bruce and company at their finest :),1388102400,,412,4.363636363636363
5908476,2,B00EE6C4NW,Great stars in movie that is sub-par. Some good action scenes but mostly just plain silly.  Look out for red mercury.,1388102400,,117,4.571428571428571
5908477,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I absolutely loved ""Red"" and ""Red 2"" was not a disappoint.  The same great characters with a few new ones made the film outstanding.  I hope there will be a ""Red 3"" maybe with Bruce Willis marrying ""the girl"" with some explosive high jinx from ""Martin"".",1388102400,,253,4.478260869565218

Wasn't too thrilled about the accent of Catherine Zeta though. Fun movie. Will be purchasing a copy of this one as well.",1388102400,,257,4.863636363636363
5908480,5,B00EE6C4NW,Usually 2nd and 3rd movies are dogs.  This was great.  A must is you like Bruce Willis and comedy.  All the original people which was nice.,1388102400,,139,4.269230769230769
5908491,3,B00EE6C4NW,"A follow on from the original RED, which I thought was better. RED 2 has a great cast but something is lacking in the movie. However still entertaining if you like action movies",1388102400,,177,4.393939393939394

5908493,5,B00EE6C4NW,Red 2 is so much fun to watch and listen too!! This is the Blu ray + DVD + Digital copy and that works out great since our portable DVD player is just that....DVD not Blu ray. Ton's of extras which are fantastic. I have zero complaints. Highly recommend this one.,1388102400,,263,4.176470588235294
5908494,3,B00EE6C4NW,"The able stars of the exciting, believable RED #1 fall short in RED 2, not because of acting ability and various skills, but because the writers and director relied on constant loud explosions, murder and mayhem and a poor plot to struggle through to the end.  Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and their able co-stars do a good job with material presented to them.  If there is an R.E.D. 3, I hope the writers will put more 'meat and potatoes' into the script.  Delve deeper into the personalities and past of the five main actors.  No barrage of back-flashes, please! (only if necessary - but clearly presented as back-flashes) but unleash your brains and allow them to develop a story line worthy of these fine actors.  RED #1 was a 5-star presentation.",1388102400,,766,4.7293233082706765
5908495,5,B00EE6C4NW,There is more comedy in this movie than in the first.  Marvin is hilarious and yet very savvy in this sequel and the killer turns out to be a good guy after all.  A great movie all the way around!,1388102400,,196,3.875
5908496,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I thought that Red was the best movie of the year so eagerly looked forward to the sequel. The problem with this movie is that there was little suspense. Everything they did worked, everything planned was perfect.. It was like the entire world just sat ideally by and let them do whatever they wanted. It was all too perfect. I have watched Red several time but doubt I will watch this again.",1388102400,,392,4.458333333333333

5908526,3,B00EE6C4NW,"It was good, but just a lesser rerun of the first one.  In fact, you really needed to see the first one (which I really really liked) to understand the dynamics of this group.  Great actors, they had fun making this movie - but not as fast moving as the first and you are not surprised by the background as you were in the first.  Fun movie, you smile a lot, and few outright laughs (not slapstick) just predictable.",1388016000,,416,4.2405063291139244

Notice that if you watch the trailer they only show her for a split second, but she actually dominates a lot of scenes. Just really really bad. Don't pay--wait for it to be free on prime instant video if you are curious and then thank me when you are able to stop watching it without paying 4.99.",1387929600,,463,4.333333333333333

It was a great afternoon escape!

5908535,1,B00EE6C4NW,"What a hideous waste of time. The film and I am being generous calling it that, was a disjointed slapdash amalgam of elements, none of which fit together at all. Bruce Willis is so enamoured with himself he can barely stand to be on screen with his actor peers. I'd seen a couple of interviews with Willis prior to the Red 2 debut and he was intolerably rude to the reporter. I should've guessed the film would be crap.",1387929600,,419,4.3164556962025316

5908546,4,B00EE6C4NW,The first episode was a big hit for us.  We've been patiently waiting for the right opportunity to watch RED 2.  This didn't disappoint.  Helen Mirren is a riot. How could she EVER be type-case after these movies.,1387843200,,213,4.552631578947368

5908554,5,B00EE6C4NW,"As with most Bruce Willis movies, this one is for entertainment, and doesn't attempt any big social or moral message. The dialogue doesn't always flow smoothly and the humor is often strained, if you can suspend your disbelief and lower your expectations, you can spent an enjoyable couple of hours with this film.",1387756800,,314,4.943396226415095

Anthony Hopkins rocks husband role in this with a brilliant performance",1387756800,,317,4.25
5908556,5,B00EE6C4NW,I just love the retired fogey badass concept of this movie it's one of the best action flicks just above the Jason Statham wave.,1387756800,,128,4.375

5908558,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I love the actors that played in this movie, but the acting was terrible.  One of the things that I think hurt the movie is something that I don't usually like to comment on. Plastic surgery! There's nothing wrong with plastic surgery if one really needs it, this person was absolutely beautiful before it. The reason I'm commenting on this is because, one of the main characters could not show hardly any emotion or even move her mouth properly to even act. It did seem like she had to look away from the camera in some instances to hide the fact. I think it affected the movie. It wasn't just her acting involved, others played a role. The whole movie could have been better done. One of the main reasons I rented this movie was because of who played in it.",1387756800,,759,4.382978723404255
5908559,4,B00EE6C4NW,Not a bad movie. A very fine line between funny and being corny in some scenes. Would recommend as it was not a bad watch. The cast combination was good as in the first Red.,1387756800,,173,3.9714285714285715
5908560,4,B00EE6C4NW,This movie is extremely funny!  Lots of action and great one liners!  Well known actors in this movies make the movie well worth watching.,1387756800,,138,4.708333333333333

5908562,5,B00EE6C4NW,"This one definitely trumps the first movie.  Easily.  The rapport between the characters is interesting and funny.  The action is different and a lot of fun.  There a quite a few thrills and twists that keep the story rolling.  Of course, the acting is superb.  You cannot get a better cast than this.

If you want a film with heart, with punch, with a sense of humor, you HAVE to see this.  Better yet, buy it.  It is worth it.",1387756800,,428,4.25
5908563,1,B00EE6C4NW,"It's like they made up the plot as they went; add explosions, high body count and voila! The dialog is terrible and delivered in the most ham handed way by some actors I consider capable of much better. I think Malkovich was drunk, stoned, or off his meds throughout, can't figure out which. Please message me if someone knows. Willis, Mirren & Sir Hopkins just phoned this one in. Collect paycheck at go. CZ Jones was just plain hard to watch. Sad that this was considered an anticipated summer blockbuster. Even sadder is, as of writing this, almost 50% of the 500 some reviewers gave this 5 stars. Hollywood has no incentive to rise above pap like this when people enthusiastically eat it up. For the record I rented this video stream under duress.",1387756800,,751,4.611940298507463

5908573,5,B00EE6C4NW,"I know I'll probably get some flack for the title, but I really liked this movie.  Movies based off of comic books stretch the realm of possibility, but are so much fun.  Most of the originals are back and funnier than ever.  It is a movie I rented and then bought as it was definitely enjoyable enough to watch a few more times.",1387670400,,329,4.190476190476191

5908576,5,B00EE6C4NW,Who else but Bruce Willis could pull of a serious action comedy. Kinda like the Whole Nine Yards. You know it is a comedy because in real life we wouldn't still be alive. All the cast are perfect chooses.,1387670400,,204,4.256410256410256

5908578,5,B00EE6C4NW,We liked the first movie Red and was excited to see most of the same characters back in Red 2 with Mary Louise Parker role being increased. The interplay between the characters is very good and you need to catch some of the punch lines.,1387670400,,236,4.266666666666667

5908582,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Everyone kicked butt in this. I'm not sure they really needed to added Katherine Zeta-Jone's character, but the action was intense, the plot was good as far as action movies go, and Bruce, once again, reigns.

5908586,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Good entertainment for the whole family though a lot of guns and physical action! It seems that in order to show realism most movies today go overboard with the blood and gut scenes - more equals realism. For me it makes me want to fast shuttle past these scenes and go on with the rest of the movie.
Red2 was pure fun and safe for me to watch with my 10 to 13 year old nieces and nephews. The first Red was just as fun and I have no complaints in the action scenes also.
Sorry for not including the plot of Red 2. It is a bit simplistic but again I just enjoyed the movie. The actors genuinely seem to be happy working with each other.",1387670400,,636,4.015748031496063

5908597,1,B00EE6C4NW,"This movie is terrible.  I didn't see the first one, so this may be old news.  RED 2 can't decide if it's a comedy or a spy thriller or if it's funny or suspenseful.  Apparently, killing Federal agents, an Air Force General and a variety of other innocent people is something to make light of.  And torture is funny!  The characters are 2-dimensional wisecrackers and the acting is terrible (although that's probably not the fault of the cast).  I'm shocked that actors of the quality of Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins would be associated with something so beneath them - they must have been paid a lot.  Unless your time has no value whatsoever, this movie is a complete waste of two hours.",1387584000,,693,4.585365853658536

5908602,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Ok I normally don't like these types of movies--I usually don't watch many Western movies to be honest.  But despite the glorification of a bunch of assassins, I really enjoyed this movie...non stop action, great acting, especially by Malkovich and Mirren.

But I'm really writing this review to give a shout-out to Lee Byung-Hun.  He might be ""just another Asian actor"" to some; many reviewers even got his nationality wrong.  He is South Korean; and in fact, he is one of the most respected actors in S. Korea.  If you don't mind subtitles, watch some of his movies and dramas.  He truly is an amazing actor!!  I believe his movie ""Masquerade"" (although I think the title translates more to something like 'the man who became king' --sorry my Korean isn't perfect}, anyways, the last time I checked, it was this highest grossing movie ever in Korea.

I'll stop rambling now.  Good movie!

5908618,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it for enjoyment and it's style. My comment comes from the fact, that as often happens with sequels, this movie focuses more on giving more ""bangs and  booms"" from stunts, than the interactions between the actors/ characters that made the original so much fun. Still worth a look.",1387411200,,320,4.818181818181818

5908626,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Red 2, in hubby & my opinions, may not be quite as good as Red 1, but it is doggoned close.  Plenty of action, lots of humor, and just plain good entertainment.  We've read that actors/actresses are already lining up for a part in Red 3, so we are hopeful that it will be written and filmed soon.
The interplay between Frank and Sara are fun, as well as good ol' Marvin (No Marvin, you aren't ""old"" - I don't want to get shot for saying that you're old!) is a real scene stealer.

5908631,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I just adore this franchise. The cast is simply what makes it work. As usual John Malchovich's character steals the show. His wackiness combined with Bruce Willis's straight guy persona is just gold. And let's not forget Helen Mirren's character - so cool, calm, and mercenary. We lost Morgan Freeman in the first one but woo-hoo here we get Anthony Hopkins as a Jekyll & Hyde scientist who's been imprisoned for 30 years.  Is he just charmingly batty or a madman? Catherine Zeta-Jones pulls off the deadly Russian spy. However, I think she could have been utilized more. I love the unexpected addition of hitman Han - I do hope he gets to stay around for more sequels.

5908637,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I enjoyed Red 2 from start to finish.  It was mostly transitions from one gag to the next, and I hardly stopped laughing.  There were, in fact, so many laughs that there wasn't much time left for plot and character development.  Maybe it's because I'm getting old, but I like a little more depth in a film than this one provided.  The lack of depth in the script is my only negative observation; everything else was very good.

Because of its near-cartoon character (it did have comic panels), I rated Red 2 down a star from the original Red, which is one of my favorite recent films.",1387324800,,584,4.420560747663552

5908647,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Although I did laugh more in this one as compared to the 1st RED, it wasn't enough to offset the ""forced"" story line which was predictable and not nearly as interesting. All-star cast though but again, I am not a fan of Mary-Louise Parker in this role. Even worse in this movie than the first. Just didn't appear ""natural"" to me.

But Helen Mirren was magnetic!!! #CougarAlert and yes, I am in 'love"". She just thoroughly convinces me without a shadow of a doubt as to the role she is trying to sell the viewers. Outstanding actress that radiates confidence.

The first film was one surprise after another. Fast paced and scene to scene so different yet able to just melt into one another. A smooth, clever film.

After seeing Red 2 ...boy was I wrong. Great story line, strong ensemble cast (nice additions of Catherine Zeta Jones and Anthony Hopkins) pacing was perfect....all in all a fun ride. What made the first movie and continued in the second was the solid contribution by Mary Louise Parker. From her ""babe in the woods"" facial expressions in Red to her ""agent in training"" fun and games in Red 2...Parker nailed the role and grounded the cast and story line. ...critical in a fast paced, comedy/shoot em up with a serious theme. The rest of the cast carried the standard story (nuclear device ...ready to go off....must save world) and through their wealth of talent made you just not care. Not the first time quality acting has made up for stock writing. Great fun from beginning to end...cant wait for the next one....M Banducci",1387238400,,984,4.687861271676301

5908655,5,B00EE6C4NW,"This type of movie is what is missing in films today. They aren't reinventing the wheel here or going for oscars. I would describe this as a romantic comedy of action adventure. Very little romance. All action/adventure but that same lack of ""in your face"" extremism.

In true comic book fashion, they keep you interested in what's going to happen next, like a choose your own adventure. You know the possible options so it's fun to guess every step of the way. The choices aren't surprising, just fun. Violence isn't gory. People get stabbed and shot WITHOUT blood-splatter and guts everywhere. We laughed, we relaxed, we were engaged in the outcome. My teenager even got into it. Think, The Avengers or James Bond with a group instead of one and without the romance scenes.

I give this movie 5 stars, not because it's so amazingly different that you're going to be surprised, but because the actors took the chance to entertain us alone, without having to SHOCK us. Maybe that in itself makes it amazingly different these days.  I will pay to see more of these.",1387238400,,1064,4.709677419354839

5908659,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Retired CIA agent Frank (Bruce Willis) and his eccentric long-time partner Marvin (John Malkovich) are back in action, though reluctantly, to fight back the assassins and save the world. In the globe-trotting story we meet familiar faces like Franks girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), MI6 sniper Victoria (Helen Mirren) and her Russian friend Ivan (Brian Cox), as well as new characters such as Korean hitman and martial arts fighter Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee) and Russian agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones). You also get Steven Berkoff, Anthony Hopkins, Neal McDonough and David Thewlis, plus nice locations, so what else do you need?

RED 2 has an impressive cast of players, but lacks one thing  style. The story that looks as if written back in the 1990s is underdeveloped and predictable at best. Old characters lost their charms partly because they have little to do (or as to Mary-Louise Parkers Sarah, she has much to do here). New characters are mostly uninteresting, with typecast players.

Im not saying RED 2 is terrible. It has old-school action sequences, such as shoot-outs and close combats, all competently done. They are fine, but nothing memorable. Perhaps director Dean Parisot, best known for his hilarious Galaxy Quest, is not the right choice for the material that requires the right balance of comedy and action.

5908671,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Another fun ride with the characters that we developed in the movie ""Red"".  The Movie was fun to watch and was enjoyable and help develop the characters further.

The gags and one liners, are just not all that humorous. These actors know how to do humor, but they don't get much to work with in this sequel. The first installment was a blast.

Victoria (the shooter) plays second team and Marvin is man of many talents- driver, pilot, relationship counselor. He is not half as crazy as he sounds. However, Baily is. There are several unforeseen twists in the plot and nail-biting escapes. **5 stars
Unfortunately, I expected more of Katja than just Frank's ex; she cannot date from his service days, and she is not believable as a current intelligence operative. Ivan, Victoria's inamorato, appears only to whisper endearments to her. Han tries to kick Frank to death, and tries again, and again. **minus one star",1387065600,,700,5.149122807017544

5908686,1,B00EE6C4NW,The movie stunk. No star would be the correct rating.  Cannot believe these 'mature' actors and actress would stoop so low for a paycheck. There is no other reason why they did this.  Bad ending for one-time good actors.,1387065600,,220,4.615384615384615

In reviewing it, as a stand alone, it has lots of action and interplay among the characters.  Anthony Hopkins shines here - of course I cannot think of too many movies where he doesn't.  But being compared to the first one is where is falls down somewhat.

It seems that they toned down John Malkovich's character some.  Much to the detriment of the character he portrayed in the first movie.

But it is a good movie and I highly recommend it.",1386979200,,563,4.388349514563107

With RED I was blown away by how he actually shows up and delivers in acting and action. The supporting cast was incredible, the action top notch and the humor was perfect. The first RED film was funnier due to the fact that I was completely caught off guard at how well written the script was. This one has more action which I welcomed. Not sure if its in the works, but I really hope there is one more on the way to complete the trilogy. Excellent job to all involved with the making of this movie.",1386892800,,644,4.286885245901639

5908761,3,B00EE6C4NW,Of course the sequel is never as good as the original. It was okay. I should have waited until it was free to watch though. All action all the time movie. The story was okay so it does keep you interested throughout. The aside dialogs are cute and some are funny.,1386633600,,263,4.176470588235294

5908772,2,B00EE6C4NW,"We loved the first one. Lots of violence, yes, but enough humor to turn it into a farce. This one goes over the top. The character's personalities have changed and do not ring true. Violence that is way over the top- overkill you might say. I won't bother watching this again.",1386633600,,276,4.431372549019608

5908779,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Awesome, funny and full of action. Bruce Willis always makes a movie great. Granted the stunts were great and in real life impossible but that is what makes a movie great.

5908791,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Oh man, I thought the 1st RED was hilarious, but they well out did themselves in this one. Loved the scene where the Asian hit man shoots 12 gazillion rounds at Willis and his buddy, totally leveling cars, cutting them ( the cars, that is ) in half with what looks like a Gatling gun.  Then he stops and asked the Willis character "" Moses, you dead yet?"" and Willis answers "" Not yet!!"". Killer man, simply brilliant.
Bruce's squeeze is funny and just cant wait to get into the action. Helen was as good as she always is in every movie she ever starred in.
So, yeah, I LOVED it. Who knew Bruce Willis could actually act AND be funny? Certainly not me....",1386460800,,654,4.274193548387097
5908792,4,B00EE6C4NW,"RED 2 brings back retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Willis) who reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device.

For those like me that enjoyed the first installment of RED, you will get more of the same and enjoy this movie as well.  With this band of characters, especially Malkovich, who mix a good balance of humor with the action sequences that the movie is known for.  Malkovich's nutty character kept me laughing all the way through with his antics.  The action is fun and fast paced and the story, although not terribly original and pretty straightforward and transparent with no hidden secrets really, is entertaining all the way through.

Hopkins also does a great job as the crazy mad scientist and has always done well in those type of roles bringing an almost comedic craziness to the character.

I think this a good one to watch and enjoyable. Like I said if you liked the first, you will like the sequel.",1386460800,,986,4.670520231213873

It expanded the 4 main characters backgrounds and allowed them to show some more quirks to their already unique personalities.  If you liked the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker, you will see the expansion of the two of them as a couple and it is very funny.  John Malcovich is as usual excellent and Helen Mirren is so witty and classy as the MI6 sharpshooter assassin.  The new 4 ""bad guy?"" characters added just the right touch to a movie that is just about fun and super action sequences.  I hope they release a directors cut and hope there is more interaction with the Anthony Hopkins character.  He was so perfect in his role.

The unique and diverse relationships bring lots of laughs.  There are few movies we would watch repeatedly, this is one of them!  We laughed through out the entire flick and have shared it with visiting family over Thanksgiving who really enjoyed the humor, too!  My personal fav's are John Malkovich and Mary-Louise Parker...such a hoot!  Also enjoy that it can be full of adventure and comedy without offensive language at every turn.",1386374400,,591,4.801980198019802

5908844,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Funny, and well written.  Great cast with excellent comedic timing.
There is no need to watch Red 1, but I would since it is the beginning of the character development and adds to the enjoyment of this second installment.",1386201600,,221,4.666666666666667
5908845,2,B00EE6C4NW,"Boring movie for a 60 year old audience. Everything in it is predictable, with the exception of John Malkovich's lines and his delivery of them which make the movie worth seeing. Malkovich gets an A for his performance. He should win a best supporting actor in a comedy award for this. He took a handful of blah and made it into a great role with great lines.

I should mention that I'm not a big fan of action comedies. I never really liked the Lethal Weapon franchise. I do find Downey Jr amusing in the Iron man franchise.",1386201600,,525,4.357142857142857
5908846,3,B00EE6C4NW,wasn't as good as the first one-Bruce Willis was great - so was the rest of the cast -Helen Mirren class act - the action was there but it just the same - Bruce Willis's girl friend in the movie is so stupid (don't think anyone in real life is that stupid) that it sort of belittled her character,1386201600,,296,4.033898305084746
5908847,5,B00EE6C4NW,"RED 2 picks up where RED left off, minus, of course, Morgan Freeman - bummer, I liked him. But along with Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker and Helen Mirren (from RED), we get Byung-hun Lee, Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones added to the mix and fray. And, what a mix and fray it becomes!

Zeta-Jones is great as a Russian secret agent (who had a relationship with Willis earlier in his CIA black-ops career). She and Parker have some great back-and-forth scenes. Lee is hired to kill Willis and, well, I don't want to spoil anything, but he does a fantastic job in his killer/assassin role. And, Hopkins, he is just amazing. What a versatile actor. You can really believe, the way he acts, that he has been held captive and probably experimented on, aside from other activities that may have occurred to him, for three decades.

Once again the Retired Extremely Dangerous crew must stop the worst of all possible scenarios from happening while avoiding being captured or killed by both enemies and friendlies. And they are forced into it after an online document attaches Willis and Malkovich to a very dirty secret that happened 30 years earlier, though they were not part of it, that very much threatens life today. As for Parker ... well, she is itching to get back into some action. Seems our lil Kansas gal doesn't want to stay in Kansas. Mirren does not have as prominent of a role, but she is very in-character as she is reactivated by her British spy masters. Malkovich is classic and just as paranoid, if not more so, as he was in the first installment.

This is a rocking shoot-em-up, explosion-filled, car-chase-full, action-packed flick with ample one liners for comedy relief that is a very worthy sequel to the first. Not sure if I like one over the other. They are both worth the price of admission (or DVD or Blu Ray) and a great back-to-back evening and, for me, earn 5 stars for pure entertainment value.",1386201600,,1945,4.697947214076247
5908848,4,B00EE6C4NW,"Lots of action, but not as fun as RED. It did not have the enjoyable dialogue that made the first movie so much fun. Plenty of action but short on plot. There was not enough of Helen Mirren and none of Morgan Freeman.",1386201600,,217,4.069767441860465

5908855,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Red was a lot of fun. It was an original story (based off a comic book series), the script was witty and had some terrific actors. Of course, when a movie does well, the studios want to do a sequel. Unfortunately, sequels with rare exception (e.g., The Godfather II, Empire Strikes Back) are as good as the original. Such is the case with Red 2. Although witty in parts, it falls flat when compared to the original.

5908869,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Still fun movie.  Even though Bruce Willis has become self absorbed.  I was not sure if I was going to watch it.  Considering his last New Die hard films which were terrible.  He just looked like a guy instead of acting but just was there doing whatever without any added character in fact the Die hard character wasn't even there. It was as if someone else was playing the character, no charm to the character just lada do this and move the character to do that.  Anyway back on the review.  This one surprised me.

Mary-Louise Parker acted as if she was sleep-walking through the entire movie; even the villain was one-dimensional. Anthony Hopkins was annoying as a befuddled menace; love, love Helen Mirren but she was under-utilized; Bruce Willis, another one of my faves, looked confused throughout; the only saving grace being John Malkovich, who was hytserically funny but his role couldn't support the whole film.

Willis and Malkovich should team up again because they have the chemistry of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in the Road series of films the latter pair did back in the forties and fifties. They really work well together and I hope somebody thinks of more to do with these two together. They were the heart of the film and it was greatly funny.,1385856000,,429,4.443037974683544

5908927,3,B00EE6C4NW,"Red (Retired Extremely Dangerous) was about retired agents being hunted by the CIA, and them having to step out of retirement and kick ass once again.  Red 2 is more of the same but, in my opinion, done a bit better.  If you enjoy the first Red you should enjoy this film.  I did not enjoy the first Red, despite some good performances, but I did end up enjoying this one.  I found it a bit funnier, the villain is much better, and the action scenes are vastly improved from the first one.  However, the film still has many of the problems that Red had that drag the movie down.

There are many things that the film has going for it.  First off most of the main cast returns here like Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, etc.  We also have new cast members joining in like Anthony Hopkins, Byung-hun Lee, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Everyone does a good job performance wise.  John Malkovich and Anthony Hopkins practically steal the show.  They steal every scene they are in.  John Malkovich was the best part of the first movie, and he is one of the best parts of this movie.  Anthony Hopkins is great in everything he is in whether it is bad or not.  Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job too.  Im glad that she is getting more work.  I like how she plays off Bruce Willis in the film.  I think that they have better chemistry than Bruce and Sarah Ross.

Byung-hun Lee as Han was also great.  He was my third favorite character in the film.  Hans character is basically what Karl Urbans character was in the first movie, except Han, in my opinion, is much better.  He is also quite funny and has the best action scenes in the film.

The action is ramped up in this which is definitely a plus.  I thought that the action in the first movie was mediocre at best.  The final action scene in particular was rather lame.  In this movie the final action scene is much more fun and intense.  It felt like there was much more at stake and it was more of a sense of challenge and urgency for the main characters which was lacking in the first film.  The effects were much better as well.  I also like more diverse locations.  The last film took place in many locations as well, but only confined to the United States.  Here we go from America to London, to Russia, then back to London again.  I cannot comment on the 3D since I did not see the film in 3D.

There are still many problems with the film.  First off the Mary-Louise Parker (Sarah Ross) character still annoys me.  In fact I find her more annoying here than in the last film.  Like in the first movie out of all the characters I find her gags to be the weakest and not funny at all.  Granted she does have more to do here and she does have a nice moment near the end.  However, she is still annoying and has to be saved multiple times again.  Since she is a main character it becomes a major issue and brings the movie down for me considerably.  Again, she felt out of place and should not have been in the movie.

Another thing that bothered me was this CIA agent played by Neal McDonough.  He was played up as a major threat at the start of the film, but then becomes basically a throwaway character after that, which was weak.  You cannot introduce a badass character in the beginning then just throw him away like that.

Overall, if you are a fan of the first Red then you should enjoy yourself.  Even if you did not care for the first movie you might like this.  I did not like Red but enjoyed Red 2 despite its problems.",1385769600,,3499,4.266768292682927

The plot, twisted and turned now and then just to keep us glued, is simple that of a retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. The team includes John Malkovich (absolutely hilarious role for him), Mary-Louise Parker (often stealing the show), Helen Mirren (gorgeous as ever and having the time of her life knocking off just about everybody who gets in her way). The other folks who are on varying sides of the law (nobody really plays by the rules) include Anthony Hopkins (in stellar form), Catherine Zeta-Jones, David Thewlis, Brian Cox, Byung-hun Lee (in a brilliantly choreographed martial arts role and the physique to match), Neal McDonough, and Tim Pigott-Smith among others.

5908974,5,B00EE6C4NW,"This movie was a lot of fun.

Most sequels never live up to the original. In my opinion, Red 2 is much better than the first movie. What I liked most was the mix of comedy and action. It was consistent throughout the movie and everything blended smoothly.

Synopsis: Frank Moses/Willis has a new life with his girlfriend Sarah/ML Parker but is sidetracked when the government puts out a hit on him and Marvin/Malkovich and declares them terrorist. Apparently Frank and Marvin had some involvement regarding a project during WWII called ""Nightshade."" Moses and crew are thrust into a wild ride across the planet to fix everything.

Action: Fight scenes are great and well done. An excellent car chase. Several gun battles. All the main actors in this movie get their chance to shine. I really enjoyed watching VIctoria/Mirren. She totally kicks butt and can handle her guns. Han/Byung-hun Lee adds a little KungFu action.

Acting/Writing: Most of the time I separate acting and writing. Not this time. Usually, when a lot of top notch actors get together, the movie suffers in many other areas, especially writing. Not in this movie. Everyone worked well together. Everyone got their funny moments and there were plenty. Unlike a lot of movies I have watched recently, this movie did not have to rely upon vulgarity nor profanity.

Family friendly: Very little cursing. Lots of killing/shooting/fighting. No nekkid people nor sexual stuff. So, basically the violence is the worst.

If I had to pick one negative about this movie it would be Sarah/Parker. I found her to be a wee bit annoying. She seemed out of place.

This movie is well worth the rental. One of the better movies I have seen this year. I rarely give 5 stars to a movie, However, since this movie shines above the competition with great acting/writing/action, it is getting the full 5.",1385510400,2,1851,4.857142857142857

He spends his days relaxing with his girl, shopping at Costco and not killing people. When he meets up with his old friend Marvin he is forced back into his old life, this time not only to save his life and those around him but the world as well. First off I did like the first Red but I wasn't crazy about it and wasn't sure a sequel was needed. After watching this one I'm still not sure a sequel was needed. The original was fun and entertaining but the best part hands down was John Malkovich and his eccentricities. I was looking forward to that more then anything when I started to watch this one. I was disappointed in that regard because the ""voice of reason"" and the one to go to for advice was Malkovich. That is totally different from his character and I'm not sure why they changed it. As for the rest of the movie it seemed flat and phoned in. While it wasn't all that terrible it just didn't have the same feel of the first one, but not unexpected. Most sequels are that way.

For the life of me, I cannot figure out why they decided to make Mary Louise Parker's character an absolute moron in this film. It took at least 1 if not 2 stars off of my rating.  The made her an incompetent imbecile.

5908995,3,B00EE6C4NW,"I just watched this movie an hour ago, and I can barely remember anything about it.

Oh, wait. It's coming back to me. Bruce Willis is Moses, an aging ex-spy. He's Retired but also Extremely Dangerous (R.E.D.). He's trying to settle down into a comfortable home life with Sarah, one of the most annoying female characters I've ever seen on film. She's played gamely by Mary Louise-Parker, who normally I love, but the character herself is written as this inspid tag-along who constantly causes trouble with her ignorance, but then throws a fit when Moses doesn't want to include her in the espionage or give her a loaded gun. And when she DOES manage to assist with the spy stuff? Why, she does it all by kissing people or being sexy, letting the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think of her: dumb but hot. Her constant bickering and whining with Moses is meant to be funny, but I found it annoying.

Moses is joined by an old co-worker, the scatterbrained Marvin who is played perfectly by John Malcovich. He basically steals the show every time he's on the screen. Together, Moses and Marvin must figure out who has recently revived in the public eye an old, failed mission they undertook long ago. Something called Nightshade. Along the way they will encounter a seductive Russian agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones stoutly refusing to do anything even remotely resembling a Russian accent), a brilliant physicist (Anthony Hopkins stealing the show as much as Malcovich), old friends (Helen Mirren openly refusing to take any of this seriously), and old enemies (Lee Byung-hun as a one-note Korean contract killer).

These actors all throw themselves into their roles with goofy abandon, providing the only real treat of the film. It's fun enough to watch them mug and smirk their way through the script. The story, however, is uninteresting and vague when it should be its clearest, with the stakes never fully clear for the first half of the plot. By the time things start to make sense, it becomes hard to care too much about the plot, which always feels secondary to the explosions and constant gunfire anyway.

""Are we supposed to care about these characters?"" my girlfriend asked in the last third of the movie. ""I mean, they sure are killing a lot of innocent people who are just doing their jobs.""

That's true, too.

I'd probably rate the movie higher -- it DOES just want to be a loud, firey, shoot-em-up -- if the dialogue had been tighter, but most of the script reads like a cheesy sitcom. I kept expecting to hear muted trombones quacking after every clunky joke or quirky aside. The film does have its funny moments, but those are mostly in the reaction shots of Malcovich and Willis. I don't think a single line even got me to chuckle.

As loud, chaotic, and senseless as a fireball, the film dissipated from my memory as quickly as smoke. It was fun to watch at the time, but a lack of meaningful characters, interesting dialogue, coherent plotting, and relatable protagonists made this film, overall, a mostly forgettable experience.",1385078400,2,3060,4.795066413662239
5908996,5,B00EE6C4NW,Just as good as RED!!  Very entertaining We purchased because we will watch it again and again.  You won't regret it.,1385078400,,117,4.523809523809524

5908999,4,B00EE6C4NW,"""Red 2"" hits Blu-ray and DVD and begs the question, ""Does it live up to its predecessor?"" All of the gang from the original is back for more action hijinks minus Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. While this sequel doesn't hold the same charm, it still makes for an entertaining diversion from the anxieties of real life as we're taken globe-trotting around the world for a couple of hours.

Ex-CIA Black Ops agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) find themselves teaming up with their old friends to find a portable nuclear device that went missing. They soon discover they're in a race against time with other organizations wanting to get their hands on the deadly weapon. The adventures take them around the world in their dangerous search as they try to stay alive amongst the crossfire of friends and foes.

The audio and video transfers for ""Red 2"" are wonderful. The movie is presented in 1080p High-Definition (2.40:1). The picture is clean, vibrant, and easy on the eyes. The 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround drops viewers right into the thick of the action with plenty of explosions and gunfire to keep them alert.

Some might feel ""Red 2"" is a little light in the special features department. ""The 'Red 2' Experience"" takes audiences behind-the-scenes with an array of featurettes centered on the weapons, cast, and stunts in the movie. A gag reel and deleted scenes are the only other items included.

""Red 2"" is rated PG-13 and with good reason. There's a lot of blood and violence as one would expect from an action/spy thrill-ride. Adult language is used as well. In a world of over-the-top R-rated action flicks, ""Red 2"" is really a rather tame good time for the mature members of your family.

I couldn't help thinking something was missing from ""Red 2."" It feels like a reunion with characters you came to love in the original. At the same time you still mourn the absence of Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. Anthony Hopkins does a relatively good job filling their shoes with his charisma as the scientist who created the lost nuclear device. While it's technically more of the same that we got from the first film, ""Red 2"" has enough humor and energy to keep viewers interested.",1385078400,,2220,4.770833333333333

5909007,5,B00EE6C4NW,"There are very few sequels Ive seen that can hold a candle to the original films.  Most of these follow-up movies are lacking in some area, whether its story or script, or even a miscasting of the characters.  But RED 2 does not fall anywhere into this category of part-two-hell.  Instead, this sequel takes the franchise to another level.  The result is a highly entertaining film full of laughs and rapid-fire action.

I enjoyed the first RED a lot, as did my whole family.  We liked how the humor was mixed skillfully with the action, which in turn made us laugh and even cringe in certain places.  But RED 2 gives this and so much more.  I can honestly say this is one of the few films that actually transcends its predecessor.

RED 2 is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  But two primary components make this movie a huge hit:  the story and the acting.  The plot is very interesting and is filled with twists and turns.  But even so, my youngest (who is 10) did not have a problem following what was happening.  The storyline is great and intricate, but it does not overwhelm the audience in the least.

The acting is also a huge plus for this film.  Bruce Willis returns as the main hero, Frank Moses.  And with him, as before, are John Malkovich, the enchanting Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker.  But we are also treated to newcomers like Anthony Hopkins, Catharine Zeta-Jones and  Byung-hun Lee.  This star-studded ensemble blends perfectly onscreen, giving a cast that any filmmaker would sell his soul to work with.

RED 2 is a massive win for me and I hope director Dean Parisot considers making a third film; I would definitely give it a look.  I recommend giving this one a shot, especially if you haven't seen the first RED.  I suggest getting both and making a night of them.

Catherine Zeta Jones is great as a Russian General - incredibly hot, she prompts a jealous reaction from Frank Moses' wife (Ms. Parker).  Reprising their roles from RED is Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Mary Louis Parker, and John Malkovich.  Brian Cox rounds out a superb cast.

On Rotten Tomatoes, this film garnered just a 42% rating from the critics - this says a lot more about the collective incompetence of the critics, since the film is objectively a fabulous action/adventure/comedy.

5909037,4,B00EE6C4NW,"""Red 2"" is an even bigger and better comedy action thriller than 2010's ""Red"", featuring everyone's favorite ""retired-extremely dangerous"" spies.  A superb cast has a blast with the plot and the dialogue as the action runs from Kansas to Washington DC to Paris to London to Moscow.

Retired spy Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is attempting to live a quiet life with girlfriend Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) in Kansas.  Old and very paranoid friend Marvin (John Malkovich) warns them of the resurrection of a mysterious Cold War plot known as Operation NIGHTSHADE.  Marvin disappears in a car explosion and Frank is taken in for interrogation by the CIA's nasty Jack Horton (Neal McDonough).  Frank will of course escape and go on the run with Sarah and the resilient Marvin.

It will turn out that the answers to NIGHTSHADE are inside the head of Dr. Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but deranged scientist held incommunicado by Britain's MI-6 for the last thirty years.  Frank, already wanted by the CIA, MI-6, and the KGB, will also have to contend with a paid assassin named Han (Byung-Hun Lee).  He will get help from a former MI-6 operative (Helen Mirren), a former Russian spymaster (Brian Cox), and a former KGB agent and ex-lover (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Together, they will have to find a reclusive information peddler known as the Frog, sneak into a high security detention area, and break into, and out of, the Kremlin.  The action and suspense are virtually non-stop, and if the plot doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense, it's all tongue-in-cheek good fun, well done by a group of talented actors with impeccable comedic timing.  Recommended as an afternoon's good entertainment.",1375488000,17,1699,5.01067615658363
5909038,5,B00EE6C4NW,"The film incorporates Wikileaks as the new problem child for Moses Frank (Bruce Willis) and company. An article claims he and Marvin (John Malkovich) were involved in a 1979 operation called ""Night Shade."" They have become wanted men.

In an expanded role Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) our meek lady from Kansas has become a thrill seeker and joins the group as they travel the world to find ""Night Shade."" In addition to Interpol and the Feds looking for our heroes, there is also a hitman (Byung-hun Lee) after them and Victoria (Helen Mirren) is also contracted to kill them...Malkovich proclaims ""Friends don't take out a contract on friends.""  They are allied by KGB agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to the displeasure of sweet innocent Sarah who says...""Can't we just kill her?""

The film is filled with Malkovich one liners which we enjoyed in the first movie. The expanded role of Sarah added to the feature. This is perhaps a notch below the first installment, but a worthy action-comedy sequel that will be in my collection when it comes out.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. One half spoken f-bomb.",1375488000,78,1110,4.919786096256685
5909039,4,B00EE6C4NW,"I loved this film.  Yes the plot is so thin as to almost be transparent.  Yes it is filled with car crashes, car chases, and the most heavily armed but incompetent adversaries on film.  But the CAST -- and the ACTION -- make this into an exciting romp by some very talented actors.  It is hard to overshadow Bruce Willis in any film but this cast manages that.  John Malkovich steals the show as ""Mad"" Marvin and does as much acting with his face as with the dialog.  Helen Mirren is clearly having the time of her life playing Victoria and she is great.  Anthony Hopkins as the mad scientist plays it to the hilt.  Byung-hun Lee as the assassin hired to kill Willis is marvelous in his incredible fight scenes plus adding some real subdued humor about his plane. Also he introduces the new Gatling gun just released by the Army and that scene alone is worth the price of admission. Oh yes -- Bruce Willis was in this film -- and yes he does a good job but it is hard to surpass this team of actors -- he keeps up because he is an excellent actor but he has stiff competition in this sequel to Red. This is a non-stop action film with a simple plot but with a team of actors at their best and having a great time in the process.  You gotta see this film",1375401600,69,1253,4.16597510373444
5909040,5,B00EE6C4NW,"Saw the movie recently and I intend to order the DVD.

This film is funny, witty, has action galore and tons of star power in an ensemble cast.

The relationship between Frank and Sarah was handled beautifully, Marvin is still bat-crap crazy, but lovable and Victoria chews up the scenery with the best of them.  Throw in a kick ass assassin, mad scientist and worldwide exotic locations and you have the perfect formula for non-stop entertainment.

Highly recommended.  If you liked Red, you'll love Red 2.  Nuff said, I'm ordering my copy now.",1375142400,6,545,4.806451612903226
