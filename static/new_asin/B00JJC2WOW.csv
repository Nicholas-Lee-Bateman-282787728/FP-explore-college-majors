8651233,4,B00JJC2WOW,First trading course on Photography that made sense to me. He didn't confuse me with various adjustments between FStops and shutter speeds like all the other courses I've tried to take. Only item I would say could use a little improvement was a couple snibbits like metering didn't make much sense. However I was able to figure it out afterwards.,1446249600,,346,4.783333333333333
