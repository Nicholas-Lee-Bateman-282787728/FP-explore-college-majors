7036320,5,B00UEM9TY2,"This movie has an excellent plot that features what solid relationships can be like if both partners are searching for truth, morals and values.
It certainly is an awakening to most kids in this generation that lack many social skills.",1430784000,7,235,4.9
7036321,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Fantastic movie that will make you rethink modern dating.  A must see for married couples, for those thinking about getting married, and for anyone looking for good old-fashioned entertainment.",1430784000,9,193,5.655172413793103

7036323,5,B00UEM9TY2,"If you like a love story, romance, and an ending that has to be seen, then believe you can have a good movie without the promotion of vulgarity or premarital relations. A movie that doesn't need to show the distraction of skin or the biggest names to sell its great story. Love waits. True friends are loyal. Obstacles overcome. Forgiveness found. Refreshing value of humor in an old friendship is not overstated. And you can wait for the right time, with prudence and virtue without being weak. That's not just a theory. This is not a bells and whistles movie. But what you will get in this story of great subject matter (which has its tense moments) is a smile to span the faces of you and your date in the end. And you will want to see it again. This is a story America needs now. I am still amazed at all the facets of the different relationships and quality of show that were illustrated in just 1hr 55min. Can't wait for the DVD!",1429833600,71,935,4.348571428571429
7036324,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I saw this movie twice at the theater and enjoyed it even more the second time.  In today's ""hookup culture"" what a breath of fresh air to take a look at what God intended a beautiful relationship to look like ---- where each honors and respects the other and where they choose self-control over self-gratification.  When did treating women with respect become a joke? asks Clay.  This movie ""resets the bar"" for every single or divorced person, to not only be patient and wait for God's best, but to know that His grace is sufficient to cover any past mistake.  A beautiful and redemptive love story where, truly, love conquers all!  Highly recommended!  5 Stars *****",1429574400,136,669,4.724137931034483

7036326,4,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned is appealing to some and unappealing to others not just because it has such a counteractive/countercultural, Biblical view of matrimony, but also because of its Forrest Gump-like blend of troubled relationships with artificial, even sappy scenes, but its truly no worse than a Hallmark movie.  (And Im not criticizing Hallmark movies, just understand why some people would dislike em.)  Ive become gracious about movies feeling too artificial and learned to pay more attention to the acting, script, and themes than the tone.

Old Fashioned grew on me after a while, having real emotional power in sections.  The male must learn to be less unhealthily puritanical and resolve his guilt about his former hedonism, and the female learns to face fear of another relationship failing.  The male actor, who also wrote and directed it, Rik Swartzwelder, had little appeal to me for the first half, but I was patient and the movie eventually showed me that hes NOT SUPPOSED TO BE very appealing, but unnaturally aloof socially, needing the companionship of a woman.  His great-aunt becomes the voice of the audience toward the end as she urges him to get past his self-righteousness.  His eventual love interest, played by Elizabeth Roberts, is quite a bundle of energy and charm.  I find it somewhat implausible that she becomes so interested in him when hes so emotionally aloof, but the second half makes up for the fakeness by exploring some serious issues of two people with bad past relationships trying to create a godly relationship of their own.  I think most outside the Christian community will see it as just a reactionary movie to the popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey, but I hope some will appreciate how it is trying to inspire decency in viewers, as our culture is over-sexualized and dysfunctional.  Even with the stilted dialogue and stereotypical view of the secular world which Christian movies such as this have, I liked it for what the second half does with the stakes of their relationship.  It became a movie I could take quite seriously as the characters really struggle through issues.

I identify with all the Christian messages, for Im a Christian myself, but the movie has merits as a movie, too.  I cant determine who would or wouldnt like or benefit from it, but I encourage you not to listen to mainstream opinions, for mainstream opinions are the ones which condone destructive sexual excess in society.  Surprisingly to me, one secular, usually hostile-to-Christian-values website, RogerEbert.com (Roger Ebert is dead, but still has a movie review website other people write for), has a positive review of Old Fashioned.  Check it out by Googling Roger Ebert Old Fashioned by Glenn Kenny.",1427414400,78,2730,5.022172949002218

How refreshing to have a movie about a man who has decided that following Jesus Christ translates into pure behavior when with an attractive woman.

It's really quite good, I loved it a thousand times.  Even if you aren't extremely Christian,  it's wonderful that the movie expresses the type of devotion to your spouse that it does.  It's a super good movie,  the plot,  the characters,  all of it. Can't wait to buy it.",1502496000,,514,4.28125

7036371,5,B00UEM9TY2,"originally,  I gave this movie two stars, and rated it as boring, but gave it a second watch.  I apologize for the first review..  This movie is, for sure, slow in getting started.  The plot was for me a little hard to follow due to the slowness of it, but the overall story line is of a return to moral decency.  A movie that reflects the original standards set forth through God's word in the Bible, and I'm thrilled to have such a movie among my video collection.  I believe this movie has a lot to say about respect and decent behavior, as opposed to the moral degradation of society today.  It is truly as it is titled  ""old fashioned"" .  And if you're tired of watching what first appears to be a nice family film, only to be surprised by a steamy bedroom scene, thrown in for effect, as if they can't sell a movie without sex and violence.  If you want to watch a movie that has returned to a time when life was simpler, truer, and more respectful and obedient to God, and others, to a time where moral decency is the norm, then this is the movie for you.  It truly is ""Old Fashioned"", and a delight to watch",1500249600,,1115,4.187793427230047

There is so much pressure these days to date around and end up in bed with the person immediately, but this movie gives a different perspective to dating.

7036379,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Loved this movie! The original marketing was wrong in pitching it as a romantic comedy focused on ""the right way"" to date or do courtship. It is not a moralizing movie, really, but shows the issues with either approach to relationship, from fearful caution to wild abandon. It is really about people and the things that make it hard to really trust and connect.

The story was definitely worth telling but it came across as pushy and self-righteous all the while trying so hard not to be either.  I am tired to death of romantic movies or romantic comedy meaning you have to sit with your remote, at the ready,  so you can fast forward or mute what is happening so you can watch and enjoy without the too common excuse for romance being offensive.
I'm grateful someone tried to make a movie that doesn't insist that all good romance is more more more sex.  I only wish someone could tell a lovely story without clean acting/storylines ending up totally plain and where good people aren't portrayed as simple minded loners.",1495238400,3,778,4.4822695035460995

I don't want to give it away, but the ending was really cute and memorable and moving. It could have used more in-depth messages about Christ and Christianity. My husband was driven crazy by the main male character  in the movie was kind of dry and irritating, a little too puritanical, it bothered me a little too. His character could have been given a little more depth and background, and made to be a little warmer even though he had his principles. Overall I personally enjoyed it,  although I wouldn't see it with young kids again.

7036406,1,B00UEM9TY2,"This was by far, the dumbest excuse for a Christian movie that I have ever seen! I have been a Christian for more than 40 years and I could barely find any traces of the Gospel in this pathetic movie. First of all, it was boring, big time. It just didn't flow. At all. Secondly, it only mentioned Jesus name once in passing, and in a very offhanded way. If the main character was a Christian, he was certainly a very messed up one. He was consumed with guilt, imprisoned with his own rules and ""trying to live a good life"" the way a typical non-Christian would. He wouldn't go to church because of the hypocrites, a true Pharisee. Also, he looked to be about 50 years old and his love interest looked to be 20 years younger which was kind of creepy. Then, even though he said he believed in the Bible,which clearly teaches a believer not to be unequally yoked with an unbeliever, he ended up wanted to marry an unbeliever. This whole movie did not make a lick of sense and was a complete waste of my time!",1488240000,9,1005,4.267015706806283

7036408,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I missed seeing this in theaters, and time has gone by without me watching it.  I finally rented it from the library this weekend and was caught off guard by the quality and caliber of it.  Let's face it, I am glad that are so many Christian based films now, but sometimes they are not very will acted/produced.  This was a well-thought out and acted film.  The soundtrack was good too!  I like that it does not shy away from real life situations when 2 adults date, and deal with past relationships and the wounds that people carry from those.  Good date movie for sure.",1487980800,,571,4.390476190476191

7036410,1,B00UEM9TY2,One of commenters (typical feminist) responded that a man should respect a woman's body and emotions. A woman should respect a man's body and emotions and God. Chivalry never left. Typical feminism. I agree with God that a husband is head of the house and a wife is to submit to her husband.,1487894400,2,291,4.509433962264151
7036411,5,B00UEM9TY2,LOVE this movie.  Thought-provoking.  Different than the average romantic comedy.  Forces one to consider the traditional values on dating and relationships that have built the Judeo-Christian family unit.  Watched it again a year after purchasing and loved it still!,1487030400,,267,5.769230769230769
7036412,3,B00UEM9TY2,"The woman who chose this movie to show at our church movie night ended up very distraught  She apologized repeatedly because some of the things in this movie are NOT appropriate to be shown in a church, including scenes in a bar where people are drinking a good deal (they don't act drunk, but maybe should be), a scene with a striptease at a bachelor party, and scenes from a ""Xposed"" DVD with drunk college girls who presumably take off their clothes and do thing for the camera.

I would not recommend this movie be shown with kids in the room.  The themes and ideas (not to mention the aforementioned scenes) are quite adult.  While no actually nudity is shown, it is clearly implied.  There is discussion of past sexual relationships and pornography, and it is suggested that one character helped produce some type of porn--nude women if not sex.

Aside from that warning, I did like the movie.  I found it very strange that a Christian man so dedicated to purity that he won't enter a room with a woman in it if they are alone and who makes his female tenant stand outside while he fixes things in her apartment would be interested in dating a free-spirited woman who is not a Christian.  They discuss in-depth everything about their lives from likes and dislikes to their pasts and how many kids they want to have and yet don't discuss the fact that he is a Christian and she is not.  And then after taking a firm stand about how he won't date anyone, he dates her.  Unless by ""date"" he means ""have sex with.""  It didn't seem like that was all he meant.

Watching the characters grow and find love is what the movie is about, and it is interesting. Some of the plot is contrived (one fight and they both seek out a one-night stand--him after nine years of a stance on purity?  Okay, sure. Both at the same time, both with the same result...just to add drama and misunderstanding to the movie and show that he's kinda a bigger jerk than her in some ways despite his high ideals...whatevs).

It's a flawed movie, but I think it's deliberately so.  As one character says, it's messy wherever you go.  Life is messy, relationships are messy, people are messy.  Despite that, love is possible, and marriage is worthwhile.",1486857600,,2223,4.5175
7036413,5,B00UEM9TY2,My wife and I consider this a very romantic movie. We really appreciated the message of getting to know someone intellectually emotionally very well prior to marriage and prior to physical intimacy.

7036494,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I have a hard time watching Christian movies, which often have B grade acting and rely on over dramatization to further plot. Once I realized this movie was religious, well, let's just say, I felt very critical. How were the religious folks going to be portrayed? Was I going to feel more sympathetic to the antagonists?

It is surprisingly well done. Yes, the story line moves slowly, but each scene feels carefully written and acted. The main characters' substance is revealed like an onion, one layer at a time. The message of a moral right and wrong is clear. Yet, the understanding that we can be redeemed from sin is just as clear. It's not a movie for children; perhaps older teens if monitored or discussed. In summary, this movie won't leave the viewer feeling empty, instead filled.",1467590400,2,792,4.739130434782608
7036495,4,B00UEM9TY2,"I enjoyed this gently paced Christian movie about a diverse couple who meet and fall in love.  I thought it was sweetly romantic the way the attraction and romance built between Clay and Amber.  Clay was reckless and immoral during his frat days in college and consequently hurt people he loved.  When he comes to the realization that he needs to become a better man, he sets strict guidelines for himself in regards to being around and dating (or not dating) women.  I admired that he was determined to keep his life clean despite the ridicule he got from those around him.  Amber has been through several relationships and keeps her bags packed , so to speak, and ready to hit the road again.  But she becomes fascinated with Clay's viewpoint and is drawn to his gentle humor and careful consideration of her.  When he makes it clear he won't date her, she starts ""breaking"" things in her apartment to get him to come around.  It was funny.  :)

Although I agree with some of what Clay believed in regards to relationships, he definitely took it above and beyond.  The whole marriage counseling thing when they weren't even engaged was strange & unnecessary  but it did make for some laughable conversations.  And there were some thematic elements that definitely gave the film it's PG-13 rating.  Things like Clay's memories of his immoral frat days and the stripper that comes to his friend's bachelor party.  As well as some topics of conversation between both his and her non-Christian friends.  Other than that, the film might be a little strange to some but, like I mentioned above, I think it was sweetly romantic.

I always look at the one stars first to see what is the worst opinions ... weird.  If you expect this movie to be hard core Christian, it isn't.  If you expect it NOT to have any edgy scenes ... then you will be disappointed.  But while the material isn't for young kids, it is a movie that I want my 12 and 13 to watch.  It shows the impact that bad decisions and relationships could have in our lives.  It shows the characters wrestling through how to have a relationship that is actually meaningful and principled and from that honors the other person.  It shows that being principled comes from our core and faith.

What is incredible is the author of the movie not only wrote it but directed it, published it and played the lead role.  Cinematography was incredible.  Depth of the plot line was deep and challenging.  It pulled at your emotions and left you hanging ... only to end extremely well.  Watch the whole thing.

7036545,2,B00UEM9TY2,"I had high hopes for this film, but it fell short. I was hoping it would be a clean, family friendly romantic comedy that promoted good values. While it did bring a few laughs, and it did advocate high dating standards and chivalry, it did not manage to do so without a deluge of inappropriate comments, innuendoes, and implied dirty scenes. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to make their case for high morals, by showing the consequences of low morals and standards, but in my opinion, they went a bit too far. It is not a film I would recommend to young viewers, or even to adults.",1456876800,,585,4.4766355140186915

Like ""The Redemption of Henry Myers"", this is a movie that we are sure to watch again.",1456444800,,369,4.6461538461538465
7036549,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Many (from public critics to individuals here) who have ranked this film poorly are missing the point of the film.

The film portrays (rightly so) how a relationship between a man and a woman should be: one of love and respect. For each other and, perhaps most importantly, for the One who created personal relationships many centuries ago. The film demonstrates how beautifully simple non-judgmental love can be between each other. On the other hand, it also pictures how  (many of the) ways of the modern world are so perverted in relationships in this modern time.

None of us are perfect. The film shows us that and more. It offers hope and a chance to begin anew...in a  way God meant it to be. We are free to choose a life of admiration, moderation and inspiration moving towards greater happiness and fulfillment. Or we can keep on doing things the way the world does them and continue to strike out over and over again.

While a blossoming romance is the center of the film's Christian message; respecting God first will bring happiness and peace of mind and true love between a man and a woman. On the other hand, it shows real world struggles and a sense of betrayal (real or imagined) not only between the couple (Clay and Amber), but in many of the other characters featured as well. And who hasn't dealt with these issues? We're all human.

It evokes a sense of wisdom from elder individuals from Clay's aunt (whom he admires) to two of his best friends. And yet it does it in a light-hearted, humorous, down-to-earth manner.

Finally, the faith of Clay and Amber in their relationship with God and each other comes to the forefront near the end of the film in one of the most tender, touching and tear-jerking moments on the silver screen. It is not condemning, rather it is transforming. It is romantic and thoughtful. Elizabeth Ann Roberts (as Amber) shines in the spotlight.

The movie succeeds in getting one to examine the deeper meaning of life beyond the love for each other. There cannot be a deeper form of love without God at its center. The way love was meant to be and does it oh so sweetly.

This is the kind of film one will want to see over and over again...in the presence of loved ones.",1456099200,2,2217,4.550251256281407
7036550,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I loved this movie. Being a Christian and dating after you've already done and been some place else is hard. I think ppl are being too hard on the movie and faith-based in general. Clay violated drunk, vulnerable women as a young man.  He has a lot of guilt and punishes himself thinking he isn't worthy or capable of having a christ-like relationship.  Jesus loved the poor, the sick, the sinners and the voice he said he hears is the holy spirit convicting him and that's the subtle change he becomes. This is just the beginning of their journey w God. Amber is also damaged, but she changes too and even tells Clay, ""I couldn't...something is different."" The holy spirit is amazing when you want to do good for God. Critics ease up. This love story where they are honoring God's principles  are only the beginning for Clay and Amber. Clay even says""It won't be easy.""  For me, it's about finding love, allowing Christ to work in their lives, forgiveness and redemption....Jesus bore the cross. Grace is given upon each of us for our wrong doings. And every day the devil presents himself to keep two ppl apart that are trying to do it God's way.  That's where you see the temptation in another situation arise in this movie. Both overcome! We are human and everyday is a challenge.  I hope somebody else got what I got out of it.",1456099200,3,1332,4.529166666666667

7036553,1,B00UEM9TY2,"Quick disclaimer: I am a devout Christian and have been all my life.
This movie portrays Christians as totally unable to handle the most basic relationships, even friendships, with the opposite sex. The male lead is not only a terrible actor, but he's controlling and honestly quite creepy. The female lead is basically a stereotype of manic pixie dream girl, and honestly I have no idea why she puts up with this man's attitude.
This movie honestly seems to believe that anything other than the courtship model is sinful and shallow. I have to wonder if the guy who made this has ever actually been on a date or had a conversation with a woman that doesn't revolve around marriage. If I met a man who said he would never be in a room alone with a woman, I'd run the other way, as it implies he is unable to control himself in private.
Quite honestly, the only realistic and relatable character in this film was the stripper because she got cheated out of a day's wages.",1455667200,6,970,4.4858757062146895

7036716,5,B00UEM9TY2,"It's awkward a bit but it's tone is one of a kind. The funny thing is my husband said that the movie seems to be directed by the main character and it was delightful to find out that it was. I absolutely adore this movie and it has so much value in it I had to watched it back to back. I'm grateful to God that He shows us and inspires us to Love past each other's flaws and past sins because that's exactly what God did for us. God is real and He is LOVE.
  I appreciate how Clay's theories in the movie were guidelines on how dating should be and how to protect each other's hearts as well as bodies. It is soo needed in today's world!
  Lastly I liked how the movie touched on self-righteousness something I've been struggling with for years and blessed be to God that He led me to this movie. Although God is perfect, pure and hates evil, He allows a way for us sinful people to have a genuine relationship with Him through the death of His son Jesus Christ. ""The Good News"" as the movie points out :-). There is forgiveness of sins and God's holiness and wrath on sin has been appeased through Jesus.
  I think everybody should watch this movie!

But, even at that, when the person we love catches us with another person of the opposite gender as them, that causes jealousy toward the person God has for us. It also does not make the problem easier, but more difficult!  In the end, Clay and Amber solve their argument and their relationship is reignited.

7036758,2,B00UEM9TY2,"Not as expected.  I sent it back.  My Mom watched it and told me there are inappropriate scenes that children should not see.  The two main stars (who like each other) discuss whether pre-marital sex will be in their relationship, should they have one.  It was advertised to be a love story, but it wasn't like Hallmark would have done.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for being old-fashioned, having high morals, and being a Christian.  Why doesn't the guy just tell the girl that likes him the truth?  The reason he doesn't do what she wants him to is because he's a Christian, but he won't say that or explain.  I was expecting a nice love story, not this.  This was supposed to be the opposite of 50 Shades of Gray, which is disgusting.  This could have been done where it didn't make the male starring in it come off as very odd.  High morals are needed in this society where many couples livestogether, then marry once they are convinced the relationship is going to work.",1445299200,4,975,4.451977401129944

God sees what we need and His arm is not shortened. He will give us our hearts' desire if we are willing to work on ourselves and also believe and wait for His best choice for our life partner.",1444521600,,416,4.2125
7036783,2,B00UEM9TY2,"Talk about the most unbelievable story ever written. A former ""soft porn"" movie-making, player, frat boy who came up with a bunch of ""principles"" that could have been the same principles for a Mormon, but wait he abandons one huge principle: not to be unequally yoked and not participate in ""missionary dating"".  But what can you expect? He doesn't even go to church, because it's full of hypocrites anyway. We have no idea what faith this so-called Christian professes. He could be Mormon--he never mentions Jesus or the gospel, other than saying that ""God found him"".

The movie makes Christians look dumb because ""being religious"" is just not cool and he never really talks about his faith, but about his dumb dating theories. Of course being religious is just not cool today, because that would mean you have some standard that you live by.  When asked which parts of the Bible he believes in by his girlfriend in the movie, Clay doesn't have an answer.  No defense of his faith or the Scriptures.  The only thing Clay defends consistently throughout the movie is his dating principles, which may or may not correspond to the Word of God, but that doesn't matter because this movie, like the theology and view of the Christian life that it promotes, is shallow and vague.  If you took away the girl and the dating principles, there wouldn't be anything left-it's obviously the center of the movie.

The subtitle of this movie, ""Chivalry Makes a Comeback"" really is the pervasive theme of the movie.  However, it is devoid of any references to Christ and is devoid of any real gospel content.  Perhaps, the one redeemable quality is Clay does have a strong desire to respect women and create healthy boundaries in a relationship.  However, this is ruined by the sappy, worldly, method employed by the makers of this movie to be attracted to a story that is interesting, but unbelievable and far from the Christian ideal.  Just ask yourself a few questions after you watch it. Would you want your son dating an unbeliever?  What about the nature of Clay's faith? Why is he not in a healthy Church sitting under the teaching of the Word of God and accountable to other Christians?  Are these unnecessary?  How is Clay's view regarding relationships formed by the Word of God?  Why are all of Clay's friends unbelievers?  Just what is explicitly ""Christian"" about Clay?  I would venture to say precious little.  And then, at the end when the girlfriend gets hammered and almost sleeps with that bozo, radio show guy and Clay almost sleeps with his old girlfriend. Yuck! That was awful!  Is this a normal courtship that should be the new standard for Christians? Perhaps some worldly view of chivalry makes a comeback in this movie, but it is a far cry from anything resembling a healthy, Christian relationship.

Added to all this unhealthy portrayal of Christian relationships and Christian stereotypes and clichs, you have what has become standard fare in the majority of Christian entertainment: bad acting, unbelievable dialogue, unauthentic characters and a lot of bad art.  More sentimental drivel for movie critics to not take Christians seriously.  I am by no means hard to please, but you'd be better off with a different Pureflix movie.

He noticed that she was not a ""serial dater"", and she'd told him about courtship, as she and her friend (now husband) were walking it out.  So many truths in this movie....a great way to introduce youngsters, both male and female, to the art of honoring and respecting yourself and others, and treating others as you yourself long to be treated (the age-old, but not decrepid, Golden Rule!)

The reason was more due to the extreme inconsistencies with the main character's faith. So utterly and thoroughly nonsensical, I turned it off halfway through. I could not stomach watching the movie to the end. This ""old fashioned"" movie did not strike me as old fashioned in the least, only a slower paced  film portraying convoluted ideas of Biblical precepts. The protagonist refuses to go to church because of hypocrisy, but frequents bars with a friend (who as it happens, is living in sin with his live-in girlfriend)--interesting Christian ideas.",1441152000,11,653,5.160377358490566

The main characters are cute and everything, and I found some of it to be funny--like the parts where she would go outside while he is fixing something... That was sort of adorable, but as a whole I found it boring. I'm not sure I'd watch it again, but it was worth a view, especially if you're from Tuscarawas County.",1441065600,4,667,4.178294573643411

7036916,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Such a lovely surprise. Heard of this through Rene Gutteridge who wrote the novelization. Saw the trailer and was instantly intrigued. After all, it's not often a romance film doesn't rely on sex scenes nor unnecessary language. It's also not often a Christian film takes risks and gets mature. This film grinds both standards.
Things happen from the start that I start wondering about (starting with the leading lady wearing an arm cast), but the further it gets in the film, the more I realize it's a story-driven movie, not afraid to show the darker, more painful side of honest dating. It also has a dash of awkward humor to ground it a little. The main actors don't have Hollywood-grade looks, that helps it be more believable.
This has become one of my favorite romance films, and I'm ber picky, especially for the elderly aunt's forward mouth and attitude (about time a Christian film have someone like her!).",1440115200,,916,4.80379746835443

We watched it with our 15-year old daughter, whom we have taught the concept of courting (for the purpose of marriage) vs. worldly dating...  I was so eager to see the movie, after reading the info. about it, I was certain I would want it permanently in our Christian DVD library that I did not even view it b4hand.  We both had the same opinion that the lead male character, Clay, pick and chose which things he wanted to adhere to in a courtship (not being alone with a woman that was not his wife, or not kissing on the lips b4 taking wedding vows); but he continued to drink beer himself and hang around his old buddies who partied as well.  At first, we thought Clay was having flashbacks to his ""old life"" ... then, after rewinding...realized he had only certain standards about some things... the part about him not faithfully going to church was a ""thumbs down"" also.  Thankfully, this character still had an influence on the friend who lived out of wedlock, etc.  We enjoyed the ending...but were disappointed with Amber in part of it.  This movie is definitely not of the same caliber as the Kendrick Bros. movies or God Is Not Dead and Do You Believe movies.

The characters are real to life--broken, histories, looking for purpose and love--and the story line provides a delightful change of the usual passion-driven sexual attraction seen in most movies. The story doesn't end with a slam dunk ""you all need Jesus"" finale, but takes the characters where they are and watches them grow and mature spiritually and emotionally as they follow scriptural principles and commands. Not a little kids' movie, as it deals with some deep sins and difficult psychology, but would be good for early and late teens and anyone dealing with love, romance, and life-long commitment.",1439856000,,640,5.163461538461538

The main two characters were surrounded by older cars, older home furnishings, they listened to radio shows on older-style radios, etc.  This symbolism was even more inherent when the friend of Clay's who was living with his girlfriend had brand new, more modern furnishings.  Anyway, I thought that was neat.  In general, the movie was a very cute romance, with lots of funny moments built in.  I really enjoyed all the romantic tension that was built up throughout the movie, without any kissing or those love scenes we've so come to expect over the years.  It was refreshing to not see what I've been trained to expect.  I really enjoyed this movie and decided that I needed to own it, not only so I could watch it again whenever I want, but so that I have another movie that I would be 100% okay with my kids watching.",1439769600,,989,4.64367816091954

After getting our tickets, while walking to our theater, a theater showing 50 Shades of Gray just let out... people were just walking out... no conversation... no smiles... nothing. When we finished seeing Old Fashioned, the audience applauded; people were standing outside talking and smiling about this movie. A 10 year old girl was talking about the movie to my Fianc in the restroom.
Without giving away the plot, if you want a movie that holds women in high regards, meaning that the are not just objects for pleasure or vice versa; you truly want to see the chinks in the armor, not just a fairy tale where they live happily ever after; a movie that values a religious point of view about marriage and dating; then this is your movie!
I rate this movie as the best movie I have seen in the past year, and this rates better than The 100 Foot Journey! I will be buying the DVD of this movie when it comes out! Thanks PureFlix!",1439251200,,1175,4.419354838709677

7036951,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Finally, a movie where the couple doesn't take one look at each other, think they're hot and then fall into bed.  That's what is so refreshing about it.
Clay knows his weakness and knew that, in his past, was not really a 'gentlemen'. He is so haunted by his past that he has decided not to be in the same room with a woman by himself. But, he uses God's Grace as a barrier and it could, eventually, make him lose Amber, who is the best thing that has happened to him.
Amber is more of a free spirit. She goes as far as a full tank of gas will get her.
At first, she doesn't know what to make of Clay. But, the more she gets to know him, the more she wants to know.
They both have pasts they'd rather forget and they find solace in each other. All without making out or jumping into the bed.
There's more than enough eye rolling smut out there.
I am glad to have found this movie.
I highly recommend Old Fashioned.

7036952,4,B00UEM9TY2,"I wasn't sure what this movie was about when I began to watch it.  I didn't really know any of the actors, so not a top of the line movie.  But it was trying to teach a lesson of purity before marriage which is so lacking in our world today.  It was refreshing in the fact that the main male character has strong principles and tried very hard to stick by them in spite of the peer pressure from his friends.  The one friend who had a radio program was not a good friend,  who seemed to have jealousy issues over the main character's stance on purity before marriage, and ridiculed him throughout the movie, even on his radio show.  It seemed like most of the men he knew tried to get him to relax his views.  He explains by the end of the movie what he used to be like, and why he chose to be old fashioned, even if it meant never marrying.  There are a few scenes of a sexual nature, so I would fast forward it past them.  They really weren't needed to get the point across.",1438992000,3,976,4.0680628272251305

7036965,5,B00UEM9TY2,"A fresh departure from altar call Christian movies. Not that we have not appreciated many in that genre. The Gospel was there, the acting was good, screen writing and directing, camera work, cinematography, the movie had a warm and believable romance but not necessarily made with a view to show it in churches primarily. I can see a lot of unbelievers being deeply touched by the Holy Spirit in this film.",1438732800,,406,4.732394366197183
7036966,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I have to admit, when I first started this movie, the acting seemed weak and forced. Especially from the main character. I was afraid I was going to be watching one of those horribly done, stereotypical, Christian movies, but I stuck with it and surprisingly both the acting and the plot picked up very nicely. The movie makes arguments from all perspectives on what ""love"" should look like. The characters feel real. The Christians aren't overly uptight to the point that you'd be afraid to take them out in public and the movie doesn't go out of the way to make non-believers look awful. There is one character in particular who is made to be unlikable, but for the most part, everyone is portrayed as not being perfect and having struggles regardless of what they believe, which is realistic.

Wouldn't recommend it for a younger audience as there are some adult references made. Those references, while surprising, didn't really make me not enjoy the movie though. It made it seem more real and a heck of a lot less cheesy. It doesn't shy away from reality at all, which is worth mentioning when it comes to Christian entertainment. Nothing inappropriate is ever shown of course, but there are some comments made by some characters that definitely warrant some discretion if you plan to watch this with the whole family or something.

Ultimately, Old Fashioned starts off a little slow, but it picks up. It kept me genuinely interested (which is mildly surprising considering what genre this movie is). The character and morals of Clay Walsh (main character) really don't fit into today's society at all. To the onlooker, they seem silly. Pointless. Overly religious and downright... old fashioned! But that's the point. There aren't enough men like Clay today. We need more men who will stand up for chivalry. As Clay puts it, ""When did treating women with respect become the joke?""",1438732800,,1887,4.857142857142857

7036984,2,B00UEM9TY2,"I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, and was really looking forwards tho seeing it. I was, however, very disappointed when I actually watched it. First off, I was surprised at just how un-Christian much of this movie was. There are many sexual innuendos and inappropriate suggestions throughout the movie. While I realize that the main characters come from checkered pasts, there was really no need to bring so much of oft into the story. Secondly, God was mentioned a few times, but He really had almost no impact on the characters lives. Clay, for example, is a ""Christian"" but doesn't go to church anymore because the people there just weren't perfect enough for him. Also it bothers me that he has these high and noble ideas about relationships, but they are presented as his theories rather than a result of his faith. Then the girl he wants to marry is not a Christian, in fact she kind of mocks at the idea; but that is perfectly fine with Clay and he never mentions it.
 The bottom line, I was very glad I decided to watch it before I recommended it to the family. I don't think this is really a family movie, nor do I think this is a Christian movie. I am very disappointed with this movie overall.",1437955200,17,1221,4.450892857142857

7036994,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I have to admit that I was somewhat surprised at how deep and beautiful this film turned out to be. It is not a religious film per se, but rather, a portrait of brokenness, compunction, and longing for something transcendent, something with true meaning, a yearning for redemption through a higher love. The male lead was struggling through past darkness in an effort to reach a higher place when he encounters a woman, who broken like himself, had the natural clarity to see the moral beauty of his character and hence ultimately provide him (and herself) a way out of his rut. The guy was trapped in an inertia of repentance that seemingly kept him in bondage as opposed to liberating him. He was going in the right direction but just failed to see in front of his nose.

While a low budget film with some pedestrian quality acting skills (on the part of the guy), I was mesmerized by this film. It was a gorgeous symbolic work of art. Absolutely gorgeous! In a certain respect, this film may be one of the best of its kind in the totality of the symbolism and meaning. I gigantically love this film!",1437782400,2,1102,4.51

7037008,4,B00UEM9TY2,"I had been looking forward to this movie ever since hearing about it around the first of the year, so I suppose I might have been predisposed to like it. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of characters and their story lines. It wasn't just a happy, fluffy, old-fashioned love story. In fact, some of the story -- concerning the life the main character used to live -- was dark enough and intense enough to make me uncomfortable. However, for me, this made the message of God's redemptive love shine that much brighter. The film is beautifully shot and the actors did a fantastic job drawing me into the movie. Also, I didn't feel any of the awkwardness that tends to hamper a lot of lower-budget films. If you like films with redemptive storylines, I think you'll enjoy Old Fashioned.
(I knocked off one star because I personally didn't appreciate that drinking was shown in a favorable light--even the main character participates frequently in it. My family has reaped the whirlwind of alcohol's destructiveness so I know how slippery the slope of ""social"" drinking can be.)",1437523200,,1090,4.803191489361702

The genuine, sincerity to respect the emotions of ""Amber"", the love interst of the main character ""Clay"", and to guard her heart is a focus we have saddly lost in today's purtuit of love. Stories like ""Old Fashioned"" should be the fairy tales we believe in. Life will be messy but love is a healing thing, not a weapon. Decency should be expected. And the tender, passionate embrace of grace can breathe life back into the most broken of hearts.",1436832000,,534,4.515463917525773

7037044,5,B00UEM9TY2,This movie I recommend for everyone. It is about how courtship and relationship should evolve. It is also about forgiving oneself for past sins and moving forward.

7037048,4,B00UEM9TY2,"I had seen the romantic movie ""Old Fashioned"" promoted on my Facebook feed a few months back when it was in theaters, but I don't get to the movie theater much, so I needed to wait for the DVD to come out. It was not what I expected at all, but I was pleasantly surprised. Clay Walsh is a former wild frat boy who has abandoned that life in favor of a quiet role as the owner of an antique shop who has very strict rules when it comes to dating. He refuses to be alone anywhere with a woman and wants to reserve even kissing for marriage. Amber Hewson is a free spirit who rents the apartment above his shop. The characters struggle to develop a relationship and learn valuable lessons about themselves in the process.

It is rated PG-13 and rightly so - there are several conversations about sexuality and both the characters have less than ideal pasts. This movie is a real conversation starter when viewed with teens. One can discuss various ideas and ideals about dating and courtship. While Clay takes an extreme view, this is one area where it is certainly better to err on the side of caution than take the opposite path. It also has important messages about mercy, forgiveness, and being able to start over even when one has made some very poor choices.

While certainly not the best movie ever made, it is a good story with some laugh out loud funny parts and a quality message. Definitely worth seeing and discussing with teens and young adults.",1436659200,,1455,4.466165413533835

And also how the man was ostracized not because he was living out his newfound convictions but because he was constantly talking about it. Rather than point to the Word of God about why he believed the way he did and have a good attitude about it, it always came up as his own personal ""theory"" and he was sullen and reclusive, filled with a ton of self accusation and self pity. If he truly felt forgiven and free this would not have been his state of mind nor what he projected to others.

It's quite charming throughout, well written, and for the most part well acted (Elizabeth Roberts is outstanding). The direction is good and requires you to pay attention. I think what stands out for me is how it handles adult themes directly, but tastefully. It exposes without exploiting...a lost art.  I'm looking forward to more from Mr. Swartzwelder.

It is a Christian dating movie, but the woman the man is ""dating"" isn't a Christian. And the ""Chivalrous"" man doesn't go to church anymore b/c people aren't perfect. So this guy has all these morals and standards for dating b/c he is a Christian, but no such rules about dating a believer OR being in church. Hmmm. 3. Instead of dating in a godly, loving, affirming way, they basically interview each other from a book of questions. Could have just had a real relationship w/ godly principles and purity applied to it.",1436140800,6,665,4.459016393442623

7037091,5,B00UEM9TY2,"You know from the beginning, this is one of those faith-based flicks, but it's really not. Clay, who is supposed to live a faith-based life, is a hypocrite. He doesn't! You can see that he wants to, or to appear to, but his aunt brings it out in the open, hitting him with a left-hook towards the end with her great line, ""you're so into yourself that you could be a dot!"" You also know that it's a love-story, right from the beginning. You know what's coming from the first scenes! However, the interactions between Clay and Amber are kind of phony in the beginning. You can finish their lines. Clay is being drawn into love, but is kind of snarky with Amber in his responses. If you are patient and can hang on, you'll find that the movie takes a turn for the best. Amber is able to see through Clay's narcissistic behavior and discover his goodness. Actually, she discovers it before he does. He is like many of us, who after living a very selfish existence, have to learn how to love and be willing to love--and that means giving instead of just taking. Clay and Amber both face the challenges that lead away from love and conquer the most difficult obstacles: themselves! That's reality! Like the French say, ""C'est la vie! C'est la guerre!"" Goodness wins out! Clay comes to life extraordinarily for his own sake and Amber's.",1436054400,2,1330,4.522821576763485

Acting and dialogue uneven and often uninteresting.  I appreciate the message, that's why I wanted to see this film. But the ""hero"" was weak and ultimately was dominated by the ""heroine.""  He seemed to be unable to articulate his reasons.  His convictions were weak.  For example, if he believed the way he did, why would a landlord, single, rent an apartment to a single woman ?  He seemed to have some vague concept of avoiding the mistakes of his past, but unable to put them into practice with any forethought.  There are many other things I could mention.

Watch it at face value as an entertaining romantic story, or take the time to dig into the layers and explore the vertical aspect of relationship and redemption that transpires in both Clay and Amber.  This movie doesnt pretend to have answers to love or romance.  Rather, it invites the viewer onto a path of intention and integrity while struggling with the messiness of the world and pain of past failures. And of course, as eluded to in its title, this process for Clay and Amber sweetly hinges on the concepts of old and new."" Find this in obvious, subtle, and sometimes surprising places throughout the movie...

I highly recommend Old Fashioned.  You may find yourself, like me, watching more than once.  And now Im off to read the book!

7037113,4,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned offers a different and strict perspective on the dating game.  For those singles trying to date in a more conservative manner; societal influences do not make it exactly easy.  The film's main character, Clay, exhibits some strong motivations and beliefs about his stance on relationships and the value of ""old fashioned"" courting.  The characters work very well to bring the film's messages to light.

The film is not 100% Old Fashioned.  As the viewers learn more about the characters and their pasts, there are scenes of a more PG-13 nature.  There is some talk of past partners and some scenes of past activities which add to the film but may surprise some viewers expecting a completely ""clean"" movie.

Would I recommend Old Fashioned?  From a film standpoint, the acting and film making is not of blockbuster caliber--but, for those looking for something a little different and a little thought provoking on the romance movie scene--this film does offer that.  The characters connect well and the film's message will appeal to Christians.  Having said that, there are scenes in the film that may not appeal to those seeking a totally 'clean' movie.  (Remember, much of the movie's theme focuses on the fact that the main character realized that he was living his life in a way that didn't bring him joy and peace and opted for a rather drastic, Christian based, lifestyle change.)

7037116,5,B00UEM9TY2,Absolutely delightful and charming like a fairy tale come true!  But the truth is this pursuit of a relationship was no fairy tale but the walk of a man looking to do life differently and a woman who fell head over heels with the man who respected and cared for her as she was created to be cared for.  Ric provided a refreshing look at the mess our society lives in.  I saw this at the theatre and hardly wanted to leave.  My husband and I couldn't wait for the movie to come to DVD.  Spread the news!  It is possible to date with God's views in mind even if the past has been splattered with a life lived upside down.  A redeeming and powerful story and a breath of fresh air.

7037118,5,B00UEM9TY2,"This is a wonderful movie that reminds us of what love is supposed to be.  Courting makes a comeback in a story that feels real, not corny.
Having our teenage daughters see this movie was a priority and they enjoyed it.  We wanted them to see what a good man looks like, sounds like, and acts like; and the importance of setting standards for yourself, not settling for anything less.  For those already married, it's a wake-up call on how to rekindle the romance that brought you together in the first place.  The story is realistic, as are the characters.
This opened on Valentine's Day, which was appropriate.  It was playing on the other side of the theater from 50 shades of Grey, also appropriate; as these movies could not be more different.

All 6'4"" 310 lbs of pro athlete, me! LOL! God renews us in such a beautiful way it's hard to describe. I lived a former lifestyle as the male lead character in the movie which made the movie even more personal but Jesus helped me grow up. 1 Corinthians 13:11 - ""When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."" The thing I loved best about the movie is how he humbled himself so often and constantly fought temptation while often giving glory to God for everything. The female character was excellent. I loved how she respected his faith enough where she met him halfway while she was trying to understand him.

NOTE: I read someone's review that gave it 3 stars -""I was very much eager to watch this movie because I am a Christian and I agree with the worldview of the main character; but I also found the personality of the main character very awkward and somehow unreal. It reveals someone fearful and full of issues. I don't know... It did not convince me to recommend it...""

I think this person missed one of the great points in this movie and about God's grace. We, as Christians or believers, are like little babies sitting on a floor trying each day to sit up. We rock left and rock right, and tumble over losing our balance in our efforts each time. The one day we are able to stand up. We're still rocking and wobbling on our feet. Then we get to the point where we can run, even awkwardly. But we fall again losing our balance. MY POINT? As a believer we are ALL ""awkward"", damaged and infants according to God. But that's what makes his grace that much more beautiful. We get to fall and tumble again and again, trying to walk as God wants us to in life. But God is there to pick us right back up! EVERY SINGLE TIME! The character in this movie had it right and wrong. He trusted in God's command to be obedient to the word. But he sometimes forgot to give the forgiveness, grace and compassion ""to others"" in the same way God gave it to him. He beat himself up trying to be perfect! IMPOSSIBLE! That seat is taken by jesus!  This self-beating isn't from God. This negative ""I am not worthy or THEY are not worthy"" attitude comes only from the enemy - Satan! Don't fall for it. We, as Christians and believers, will continue to fall and rock during our walk for the rest of our lives! BELIEVE that God will always be there to pick us up because HE WILL. He promised to and he always keeps every promise. I love the character's grandmother for hitting him with the hard and direct truth! Thank you Jesus!",1435104000,7,2762,4.257142857142857

My pastor used to say that sometimes we are so heavenly minded that we are no earthly good.  I also thought his aunt was wonderful and was a cool influence on him.

And although there are differing views on courtship, this didn't seem like a good example of a courtship. Instead of previewing the movie, we allowed the children to watch it. Mistake.

7037163,5,B00UEM9TY2,"This is a remarkable movie!  Rik Swartzwelder conceived and wrote a beautiful, compelling story filled with rich symbolism and layers of meaning. His artistic and professional skills, as well as the work of his team, resulted in beautiful cinematography and a powerful presentation of his message. The characters in this tender love story are real in their flaws and struggles; the voice of reason is succinctly, and at times, humorously, offered by a wise elderly great aunt. Underlying and woven through the romance story is a gifted, subtle presentation of hope, redemption and healing that is inviting. For me that was reminiscent of New Testament renditions of Jesus way of teaching. I have watched the movie multiple times and seen something newly inspiring in it each time. Some critics have noted that during the first half of the movie, the protagonist, Clay (played by Swartzwelder), is rather dull, but that is intentional: it presents him as the rather joyless person he has become as he tries overly hard to ""perfectly follow self-imposed rules"" and ""go it on his own"" in an effort to deal with his deep regret for past mistakes.

The Characters: Flawed, ""real"" characters you can relate to as well as a struggle we all face. One I'm looking forward to watching again.

The Plot: Relevant and well thought-out with a climactic scene that leaves you smiling for days.

The Setting: Understated, keeping with the overall theme, but powerfully symbolic.

The Romance: This is a love story unlike any other I've seen on film, owning its share of heartache as well as the push/pull & playful banter we all want in a romcom or a real life relationship.

The Pacing: Old Fashioned encourages deep contemplation of issues normally glazed over in your average chick flick. The film's pace is in keeping with its old fashioned theme and works incredibly well for its target audience.

7037171,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned brings a breath of raw honesty to the screen and somehow paints it with both a heavy and lightly graced stroke of warmth, bringing to life a tapestry of words, ideals and principals that would be helpful to any soul meandering its way through this life.

Besides the warmth of the colors, youll also be enveloped by the warmth of its slower paced story telling.  Slower paced in the best and most remarkable of ways, as to allow the story to unfold naturally and more lifelike rather than continually hitting the viewer with unrealistic ideals and outcomes; simultaneously serving as a lesson in the backdrop of the story taking place in the forefront, that there is deeper beauty to be seen when we slow down to truly see it.

Its a movable, inspiring and livable work of art.  Piece by piece, layer by layer, were introduced to new depths of the characters as well as their flaws as an abundance of love and grace gently fill in and slowly begin to heal each and every broken space thats brought to light.

Clay and Amber are beautifully cast in this fictional story that in the end teaches us all about a very factual one, that even amidst all of our broken imperfections, our hearts ever remain invaluable and worthy of love, grace and forgiveness.  We just need believe it.

The film also carries within it the feeling of longing for home, that feeling we all crave; an authentic and true safe haven from a world that at times, seems to consciously be working to tear you apart, seam by seam, stitch by stitch.  And home won't always be found inside the confines of four physical walls, sometimes its found within the figural four walls of another persons heart, but regardless, its always a place that ultimately brings healing to us.  In many ways this film will act as a home for many of you, a starting point and a place where you can come back to center and learn to forgive both others and yourselves.  Let the grace wash over you.

Is it packed with action?  Well, not in a worldly way, but its most certainly packed with authenticity and goodness.  And ultimately, isn't that what most of us are longing for, just some old fashioned goodness?

It perfectly stitches life together with a thread of invaluable lessons, some lighthearted (you'll laugh and you'll cry) others a little more heavy, but all with a gentle splash of both love and grace.

Were all broken and worthy of love, grace, forgiveness and redemption in a world that often harshly judges and criticizes.  This story will wrap itself around your heart and likely do some mending of it at the same time.  After all, thats what the best stories do.  They leave you better for having heard them.  And most importantly, thats what love will do.  -danna",1434672000,2,2740,4.598765432098766
7037172,5,B00UEM9TY2,"When a big-screen faith-based romance hits the screen the same weekend as the highly-anticipated adaptation of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, it could be coincidence. But probably not. More than likely, its clever counter-programming that Hollywood types have done before, such as offering a new family feature on a date when an R-rated raunchy comedy opens.

Old Fashioned is the polar opposite of Fifty Shades, which should interest not only Christian audiences, but also perhaps anyone hesitant to subject themselves and loved ones to a big screen glorification of sadomasochism. In all actuality, this programming choice is putting love in a side-by-side contest with lust.

Old Fashioned is the story of Clay Walsh (played by the films writer/director/producer Rik Swartzwelder), an antiques dealer who is shy, guarded and moralistic. When a new girl, Amber Hewson (Elizabeth Ann Roberts) arrives in his small Midwestern town, shes intrigued by his faith in God and his convictions. Through the story, the film reveals the flaws of both characters and the emotional healing they can provide to each other.

The story may sound familiar but the film offers well-developed characters and a charming, compelling story. Walsh delivers some of the films best lessons, both through his spoken convictions and his backstory, which offers a glimpse of how he arrived at them.

Because of those convictions, Walsh has to make some hard choices, such as not being alone with a single woman or even walking out on a bachelor party offered for one of his friends. These are real-life dilemmas and its refreshing to find a main character in a film choosing the high road. In Old Fashioned, younger viewers will find a solid but counter-cultural approach to romance with principles that will help them avoid their own mistakes. Older ones will enjoy seeing romance kindled in the lives of the likeable main characters.

If Old Fashioned is to be judged simply as a movie alone, it would pass the test. It is well-produced, well-acted and well-written. However, as a player in a cultural standoff, ala David and Goliath as Swartzwelder has proclaimed, it serves a much bigger purposeto show the world the road of self-gratification it doesnt have to follow. Like Gods Not Dead or Left Behind, even a moderately-successful run will send shockwaves through the culture. Its definitely a movieand a causeworth getting behind.",1434672000,3,2420,5.147582697201018

I really enjoyed watching the characters figure out this whole ""old-fashioned courtship"" thing.

I wish I had known these principles when I was dating in high school and beyond.  It would have made a huge difference in my life.  I'm now passing these values on to my daughters and this movie helps me deliver a positive, wholesome, albeit unlikely, message to my daughters.  The message being that they are valuable in the Lord's eyes first and that they can and should wait to meet a man who values them, loves them in a respectful and godly way, and knows there is so much more to a relationship than sex.  A fantastic movie with an excellent message, believable characters, gorgeous scenery, and an ""old-fashioned"" feel to it that hits the mark perfectly.",1434672000,,790,4.489510489510489

It's not flashy. It's not action. It's not shoot'm up, fast car, explosions. It's 2 people who've made a lot of bad mistakes in life who are tired of making bad mistakes. Spoiler alert. It moves s-l-o-w. But for a reason...you're getting to know the characters, just they way they get to know each other. The way we should get to know a girl we MAY realize we want to marry someday. And it does get intensely gritty and painful. However, the realities of PAST stupid decisions and actions eventually come to the surface almost destroying a beautiful relationship...but, by God's grace...you'll have to watch the incredibly simple, incredibly awesome ending. It will blow you away. We don't have to spend a lot on our girlfriend/wife...we just have to spend our heart on them. This movie helps to find that heart.",1434585600,5,978,4.626436781609195

In this day and time, that is so important. I love that this movie is based on God's idea of love and not society's. I loved it!",1434585600,,300,3.8548387096774195
7037186,5,B00UEM9TY2,"The movie, Old Fashioned, was refreshing to watch. I pray that each of our 4 children find this type of wholesome romance as they come of age.

It is sad that this type of behavior is deemed 'old fashioned' in this day and age. As taken from the movie, ""When did treating women with respect become the joke?"" My concern is that we have become so desensitized by what we are seeing and hearing in the world around us, that wholesome, romantic love is perceived as dull and boring. When in fact, it is beautiful and fulfilling.

I am thankful that this was a movie that I could watch with my teenage daughter. I appreciate that this type of wholesome romance had her so captivated that she was upset when the movie ended because she was left wanting more.

Old Fashioned is good for singles as well as those who are married. It reminds us that relationships are not easy. When my husband and I got married we took vows before God and our family and friends to take one another to have and to hold from that day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish; until death do us part. 19 years of marriage have proved that it is not always easy, but it IS worth it.

In addition to the overarching theme in the movie, there are multiple underlying themes: The power of the Holy Spirit to change hearts and lives. The importance of standing for one's convictions even when it is not the easy choice. The impact that living a faithful and consistent life can have on those around you. The value of having a spiritual parent type figure (in this case an aunt) that you can go to, who will give it to you straight, not sugar coated. The effect of expressing a genuine care for others, desiring to hear their story. Amidst all of this, the writer kept it real. Clay seemed to struggle with understanding that he had been washed whiter than snow (Psalm 51:7), which in our finite human minds, it is difficult to comprehend that we can be separated from our sins as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12). Clay and Amber were not perfect, they were human. Clay had unsaved friends. He was mocked for his beliefs. He was viewed as odd. He ruffled feathers and got in a scuffle over it. Clay and Amber questioned one another, got upset, and experienced temptations.

I commend the writer of Old Fashioned and applaud those who took the step of faith in getting this movie to the big screen. I look forward to what they may produce in the future. May they be blessed in their endeavors.",1434585600,3,2542,4.388535031847134
7037187,5,B00UEM9TY2,What a enjoyable movie.  I even took 3 teenage granddaughters to see it and they loved it.  It was so genuine & different from what they see on television.  Made me feel so good to have exposed them to something morally decent.,1434585600,,227,4.357142857142857

We had to drive almost 2 hours to see this movie, and we were so glad we did.  The minute it finished, my son asked if I would buy it once it came out on DVD, but I had already decided to surprise him with it within the first few minutes.  We will be showing this to all of his friends, guys and girls alike.  This is a movie that got us thinking, and got us talking, because it affirmed the way my son feels - for once, he didn't feel so alone in his thinking.  He has felt he was born in the wrong era, and that no one understands why he is waiting for the girl God chose for him... thanks to this movie, this is a conversation that will be easier to have with other kids, and it may change the way they treat each other.",1434585600,,788,3.9683544303797467

7037221,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Very rarely does a film come along that I so highly endorse!

So many times Hollywoods movies, although of the highest quality, acting and excellence, violate my conscience or my soul.  Wether its violence, sex, language or trashing traditional values, I feel dirty after see those movies.  Many times films that espouse high virtues can be so poorly done, the message is lost in the lack of excellence.

My wife surprised me on Valentine's Day to see this limited engagement film I never heard of called Old Fashioned.""  Oh my God, what a beautiful piece of work it is.  I was so taken by the film, I had to rush back and see it again and now I have ordered it on Amazon so I can watch it over and over and show it to everyone important to me.

The film has its own minor flaws.  Only so much can be done on very limited budget.  The male leads acting (who also wrote and directed the film) is acceptable, but not the best.  The production value and cinematography, on the other hand, have solid quality and interesting effects.  The acting of the female lead and female supporting actor are outstanding, on a par with the best Hollywood can offer.  These actors are completely unknown making it even more impressive.

The film does not have an in your face Christian message, to its credit, but it does show a very traditional and counter cultural model of the man setting the boundaries for dating and sex vs the woman and through his spiritual leadership how he inspires her to higher virtue.  The main character, Clay, is not a goody two shoes.  He has a very flawed and sinful past and current struggles, but he is real.

My goodness this is a great film and yes I highly recommend you buy it and see it over and over again with those you love.  You won't be disappointed.",1434499200,3,1778,4.438271604938271

The movie Old Fashioned was being released the same day as Fifty Shades of Gray, which is exactly the type of movie I DON'T want to see with my husband or a theater full of strangers. So for Valentines Day, I thought I'd surprise my husband with tickets for Old Fashioned. All I can say is when we left the theater, we were full of joy and smiles. Everyone leaving had those same smiles and warm hearts. I preordered the DVD so that I could have in my small  collection of movies that I will watch again and again.

As a parent, this is a whole family movie and I am especially glad that the character with the relationship standards was the male (Clay).

7037234,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I had the great pleasure of catching an advance screening of ""Old Fashioned"" before its theatrical release, and I loved it.  It is a lovely, romatic story, and the film is visually stunning.
Some of the early reviews were not very favorable towards Rik Swartzwelder (who wrote, directed and stars in the movie), but I thought he did a great job as Clay.  What these reviewers apparently didn't get is that Clay is not SUPPOSED to be easy to love in the beginning.  He is stubborn, extremely hard on himself (and others), and a bit stodgy.  By the end, he has experienced great personal growth and he has become a bit humbled and much more likeable.  Elizabeth Roberts (Amber) is utterly charming, and the actress who plays Aunt Zelda is fantastic.
I am not what Amber would call a ""religiouso"", and I loved that this movie, while quite spiritual, does not beat you over the head with its Christian message.  Regardless of whether you are a hardcore Christian or an atheist, I think we can all agree that relationships in this day and age are hard.  Far too many people become romantically involved too quickly, without really getting to know one another, and that's a problem.  Yes, the characters in this movie go in the extreme opposite direction, but they also acknowledge that their method of courtship is not for everyone.

The reason it didn't get 5 stars is because old fashioned values are good, but old fashioned technology is bad!

7037237,4,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned is a different kind of movie. Usually all love stories talk a lot about sex and going out with many different partners, but Old Fashioned tells about a young man, Clay who has a past that he wants to forget.
  Clay was a playboy whom got tired of it and started to follow God. He has many new rules about what a relationship should be like. He even goes as far as not being in the same room alone with a woman. I admire couples who put God first and keep their relationship pure, but I do think that this movie goes to far the other way.
Clay really has a self-righteous attitude and his Aunt tells him what she thinks of it and him. That really gets to Clay and makes him think. He was trying to hard to be prefect when no one can be.
  Both of the main characters in this movie are very likable and do a great job.  I will recommend this movie If you like a love story, romance, and an ending that is the best part of the movie and where both partners are searching for truth, morals and values.

7037239,3,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned is a film about a man committed to Christ, and a woman running from life. While Clay Walsh struggles to live-out his commitment, he thinks he is unworthy because of his past. In the midst of his struggle, Amber rents the apartment above his shop and does everything in her power to test his convictions. Somehow he finds that endearing and falls in love with her. Obviously, he also found it a bit disconcerting, but puts the blame on himself instead of her. Amber admires Clay's old-fashioned ways. Even if her friends think he's a whack job. Clay's friends have issues of their own, but encourage his relationship with Amber.

While I know strippers, pornography, and discussing sexual parters are all part of modern day, I didn't expect them to be so prevalent in this ""old-fashioned"" movie. While it doesn't show anything inappropriate, there is a ton of sex talk, and a lot of other innuendo and such that is implied. All of this was left out of the trailer, blurb, etc., so I was completely blind-sided by it. Again, I understand the need for some of it, but I really think they put it on a bit thick, and could have handled it better.

All that said, my husband and my mom loved it. I probably won't be recommending it, but they both would.

~ My Thoughts~
I loved this movie!
This movie was art.
The music was art.
The cinematography was art.
The unusual way of interspersing scenes was art.
I find it hard to describe...
You're in the middle of a scene,
you suddenly switch to another,
then back to the first repeating until the scenes have finished.
I've never seen it done like this. Amazingly, it worked.
It was like listening to private thoughts.
The chemistry between the characters was art.
The scenery was gorgeous.
The antique shop, the apartment, the town made me want to move there!
Where is it?
The story was beautiful.
It was so real.
It addressed real life issues and the baggage that comes from a life of self-centered sin,
no matter the form.
Real Christianity and faith was portrayed clear but natural way.
It showed progression, growth, building trust, taking a leap of faith.
It was just beautiful.

You'll soon read my review of the novelization of the movie. I read the novel first just because that's the way I like to do it. The movie screenplay was written first, then the novelization, and finally the devotional book. Obviously, there was more detail in the novel. Reading it first made me appreciate nuances of scenes that I might not otherwise have caught. But, this movie stands on it's own. It's complete. It's charming. I liked it a lot. I'll definitely watch it again.

Now, about the PG13 rating.
Take it seriously.
This isn't a movie for kids or young teens.
Since I read the book first, and had read details, I chose not to allow any of my teens to watch it with me the first time. My husband and I have a long standing rule about previewing movies. I was nervous about how much of Clay's frat life from nine years earlier would be shown. These scenes were handled very tastefully. You got the gist of what was going on without seeing skin.
After watching this movie, I will allow my seventeen year old daughter to watch it. It will make her aware of some things to avoid and also how beautiful a pure romance can be. I'll probably have my other teens wait until they're a bit older.",1434412800,2,2115,4.534031413612565

A romantic-drama ~*Old Fashioned*~ feature film DVD,  2015

About the movie:
DVD Releases on June 16, 2015
115 minutes // Genre: Drama // Rating PG-13

My Review of ~*Old Fashioned*~ romantic feature film:
From the moment Amber opens the door to the antique store, I absolutely love the inside of the door ~ the certain shade of green that says, ""Welcome."" An entry, no further... yet; welcoming a new day, new beginnings to celebrate.

Aunt Zella puts things into perspective. I loved her. First, with her Blue Willow teacups, and then her outspoken caring ways that surround Clay with acceptance, counsel, assurance, and searching.

And the children ~ ""He knows your giggle, and He knows your name."" Yes, He does! First visit to church together, and the children are singing, wholly open.

Learning that you cannot earn to remove guilt of your past, a newness ensures as walls come down and the realization of a Love so pure, given exactly for you.

I am looking forward to reading the book based on the screenplay to recapture the moment and beautiful lines that transpire to freedom.

***Thank you to Propeller for inviting me to be a part for the DVD tour of Old Fashioned. You will be glad you came. This review was written in my own words. No other compensation was received.***",1434326400,,1308,4.756637168141593
7037242,4,B00UEM9TY2,"The creators of OLD FASHIONED are to be commended for their attempt to counter the message of free love without repercussions that is pushed by most forms of entertainment offered in our current society. Its primary focus is on treating women with respect and that fact that it is possible to save physical intimacy for marriage.

I will admit that for at least the first half of the film, I thought that Clay was way too self-righteous in the way he came across. I admired him for standing up for his values but his attitude would (and did) turn most people off. Amber, on the other hand, seemed to be just a little too flippant. At first I thought that Clay was just a challenge to her and she was determined to break him down. Somewhere along the way, she actually became attracted to the very traits that she had ridiculed at first.

Despite his self-righteous attitude, Clays character was appealing and he did loosen up before the end. I personally thought the very best part of the film was when his aunt told him exactly what she thought about his attitude.

I would recommend that parents make it a point for their teens to see this movie at least once. Its time for our youth to know that Hollywood does not have all the answers.

I received a copy of the DVD from Flyby Promotions Blogger Network in exchange for my honest review.",1434326400,3,1341,4.483606557377049
7037243,4,B00UEM9TY2,"I saw this on opening night and now old the DVD.  I'm glad there has been an alternative to the 50 Shades stuff and hope that this movie touches lives.  As a person who is more traditional myself, it was very encouraging to watch a movie with characters that are living a lifestyle closer to my own.  I hope that this can be used as a tool to point out that relationships don't have to be the way they are depicted in other types of films and that God really does have a plan for us all.",1434326400,3,487,4.0
7037244,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I really had no idea what to expect from this movie. It has a lot of good reviews but I thought it was just a movie for people who are dating. I was wrong. I've been thinking about this film since the last scene played. I think this storyline is one to make the watcher think not shove certain views into your face. The acting is very good and I thought it was really well made. Clay and Amber both have a lot of dirty laundry in their past and I liked seeing how Clay had become a changed man but was friends with people who obviously hadn't changed. A lot of tough topics are brought up and the movie leaves it to the viewer to really decide your own opinion. The movie is rated PG-13 and I would say that is valid and teens and older should watch. This is a good movie for people in a relationship or single-either way I think it's worth a watch.

7037246,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I have heard the story , read the book and seen the movie and it inspires me and warms my heart every time. It is must see! Wonderful story to ponder (in depth) in this often superficial world that we live in today.",1433635200,,215,4.023255813953488
7037247,5,B00UEM9TY2,Wonderful movie.,1433548800,,16,7.5
7037248,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned is a very special film.  I watch a lot of movies.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but the writing, editing, acting, and cinematography by David George (Stunning by the way) is pretty much perfect.  Youre a very talented man Mr George and hats off to you for making Ohio look so gorgeous.  A feat not easily accomplished!  I don't often use the word ""perfect"" to describe a film, but this one deserves it.  I think it transcends the genre it's in which is really saying a lot.  I think over time this movie will transcend not just the faith based genre it's connected to, but the romantic/chick flick genre as well.  Yeah.....it's that good!  So, having said all that: WHERE'S THE BLU-RAY PUREFLIX ENTERTAINMENT???!!!  As a studio you are putting out some pretty good stuff and building up a solid library.......I think over time that ""Old Fashioned"" could easily become one of your best-selling titles as word of mouth spreads.  While it didn't get the publicity that ""God's Not Dead"" did, I think it would have easily done around the same box office or better if it had, and if it wouldn't have come out during a month long blizzard in the East!!!  I had several people tell me that the only reason they didn't make it to the theatre was because of the horrible weather.  One family I talked to turned around on the way to the theatre and went home it was so bad.  I have promoted this film to just about everyone I know and I can't express just how disappointed I am that a remarkable film like ""Old Fashioned"" is not receiving a high resolution home video release on the Blu-Ray format!  For the record, I have ordered the DVD to put some cash towards this release in the hope that it will help bring about a proper Blu-Ray release to those of us truly wanting to see the film look the best it possibly can on our HD displays.  It was filmed in high resolution..please make it available to the home video buying public in high resolution!  Thanks in advance to anyone reading this review that is in a position to do something about making a Blu-Ray release of this amazing film available to the public.

Update: 6/17/2015  If it wasn't bad enough that Pureflix chose not to give this film a Blu-Ray release; it appears that the DVD has serious compression issues.  This happens when too much information is squeezed onto the disc.  A few minutes into it on a 46"" HD TV, my wife and I looked at each other wondering what was going on.....it's like our vision kept going in and out of focus.  At chapter 8 around the 33:00 mark it's really on display how egregious the compression is while looking at Lucky Chucky's mic in the studio.  You know it's bad when it's obvious on your 17"" computer monitor, much less a 46"" TV or larger.  Shame on you Pureflix!  I expect this kind of quality when I purchase a 4hr long cartoon disc from Dollar General for my kids!!  I'm beyond disappointed in your lack of quality control for such a beautiful work of art.  The folks behind this production clearly put forth their very best to tell this story, couldn't you have at LEAST given it a proper home video release?!!!  My copy will be returning to Amazon.  Will someone at Pureflix please FIX this and get this film released properly?!!!!!!!!!!!!  Like on BLU-RAY????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of us that are huge fans of the film; it would seem that purchasing an HD download from one of the many places offering it will be the best that is ever available.  If the producers were smart; they would see to it that a special Valentine's Day edition 2-disc DVD and Blu-Ray were released at some point in the future.  While I haven't purchased an HD download yet, I suspect that the picture quality will be significantly improved since it won't have the commentary track and other things that forced the compression issues on the DVD.  The commentary track with Rik Swartzwelder & David George is very good and well worth a listen.  I look forward to hearing any comments from other fans that are able to compare the DVD to an HD download.  I will report back once I have had a chance to check it out myself.

Update: 2/23/16  Pureflix has re-issued a new DVD of ""Old Fashioned"" fixing the compression issues.  Thank you Pureflix for listening!  While I am still very disappointed in the lack of a blu-ray release, it is now watchable on standard large screen TVs and projectors.  The smaller your display is the better it will look since it is still in low-res.  Since I no longer have my original copy I don't know what the original UPC code number was, but here are the numbers from the re-issued DVD for those that want to make sure they receive the right version.  There are two sets of numbers with the first being in the standard black & white UPC code and the 2nd set right below that.  UPC Code #8  57533 00389  9.  Below that the other code is #PFEGEN899.  I suspect that this additional code was tied to the re-issue, but I'm not sure.",1433548800,48,4994,4.533557046979865

7037251,5,B00UEM9TY2,"Old Fashioned is Incredible filmmaking, because of an equally incredible storyline. Here are five reasons to purchase the DVD:
. Old Fashioned's story is true and rich, borne of characters that are believable,
. The cinematography is top notch as are all the other production values,
. The acting is impeccable (kudos to Rik Swartzwelder, Elizabeth Ann Roberts, Dorothy Silver and the entire cast),
. The message is convincing and clear, enhanced by offering main characters who are flawed but open to change,
. How often do you get a chance to support quality faith-based entertainment?
Kudos to Rik Swartzwelder (who wrote, directed and played the part of Clay and to the entire cast and crew of Old Fashioned!)

And here's one bonus reason to pick up the DVD:
. Did you notice how many reviewers have mentioned they saw the film in theatres multiple times, saying they got something more of the film each time they saw it?

Please do yourself a huge favor and purchase the DVD!",1433376000,16,980,4.792899408284024
7037252,5,B00UEM9TY2,"I have now been ""courting"" a beautiful Godly lady since December of last year. We both have resolved in our hearts and lives to know nothing but Jesus and Him crucified.

We have failed miserably at times with maintaining God at the center of our thoughts, words, and actions regarding our feelings and attraction for one another. But, we continue to be brought back to His throne of Grace and mercy over judgment.

We had just began reading a book entitled ""choosing Gods best"", which outlines the God honoring progression of a relationship towards marriage, when I first saw the trailer for this movie. And it was like a confirmation from God that He was honoring our desire to build our relationship upon Him. I took my lovely lady on Valentine's Day to see it and it touched us both deeply and gave us additional encouragement to continue pushing past the temptation to give up and just follow the worlds formula for dating.

We both loved the movie!
And now ever since, she frequently refers to me as ""stress boy"" and I will reply by calling her ""pretty lady"" :)

We both recognize and point out the term ""old fashioned"" when we see it in random items and messages...

I fight back tears of joy when I hear the song ""clocks and calendars"" by Ivan Colon because of what it now represents through the movies influence on our relationship.

It has energized our relationship in simple ways, yet they are making a big impact in our growing connection with one another.

I have preordered a copy of the DVD and it is scheduled to be in my mailbox on June 16, and we are getting a group together to watch it that night.

I imagine at some point I will have to get another copy of the DVD because it will either wear out from being over played or it will be given away to another couple that desires to seek God first, love second...

Thank you Old Fashioned for becoming a neat little part of our relationship :)",1433289600,,1911,4.45272206303725

7037257,4,B00UEM9TY2,"This is a review of the film, not necessarily the DVD.

Old Fashioned has an agenda. Is that a bad thing? Agenda films can be highly entertaining. Fahrenheit 911, Supersize Me and other films have been successful despite having a specific worldview to promote. People who disagree or haven't made up their minds on the issues can still appreciate the effort in the film.

The film tries to be the antithesis of the hollywood love tropes, and this is it's strongest asset, and also where it gets a little blinded. We get a good shot at a story in which two people are drawn to each other because they discover each other, not because the script prescribes it. The biggest thing this film has going for it I would argue is NOT that it is telling ""the other side"" or a safer more conservative or religious 'friendly' film. Rather that it manages to be, for the majority, surprising and unexpected. This is a story we haven't seen done to death in one form after another.

Does the film have weaknesses? Sure. It drags in places (though it chooses to be slower paced, which is fair) and definitely has a sappy innocence and cheesy Hallmark movie feel. The acting might be a distraction for some who are looking to poke holes in the film, but if you're willing to let the film take you on it's ride, it's definitely not the worst of indie films and even has a few (not a ton, but it's share) convincing heart-string tugging moments.

I enjoyed the film and appreciated that the story and subject was virtually unexplored by hollywood, so it seemed fresh and new. And despite having to tiptoe along the edge of being preachy, I'd say mainly manages to avoid pointing fingers. Indeed, to the film's credit, one of the best parts of the film is the willingness to call out the main character's almost blind dogmatic adherence to what is ALMOST an arbitrary set of self-imposed rules. The film doesn't represent ultra conservative values as the solution to the world's problems, but rather acknowledge that people have differing viewpoints, and that successful relationships are built on being willing to accept others when you're NOT perfect and don't always see exactly eye-to-eye.

I'd recommend this film if you're not the type to immediately get bored with made-for-TV movies, if you enjoy simple and engaging love stories, or if you have the curiosity to visit something new, and experience a different worldview on the things it means to be in a relationship.",1433203200,3,2457,4.717948717948718

A new way to be Old Fashioned. Buy this dvd. Bribe your teens to watch this movie with the ""not hip"" title. You'll watch it again..and again. Much healthier and more satisfying than a bag of chips.

It's only been recent when our culture has turned to ""hook-up"" dating and stripped the meaning of true love out of a girl-meets-boy relationship.

8705507,5,B00UEM9TY2,"This is a very intriguing, little-known gem of a film. Honestly, I am not a fan of current films per se, but this is an incredible exception. Engaging, novel idea of romance/dating against the grain of typical premarital physical involvement. The quirky, wonderful surprise ending alone is worth watching the film. Great background songs of little-known music. (Get the movie soundtrack CD of these!). Have I peaked your interest yet?:-) Even better with each viewing. Thank you, Rik, for your vision in putting out this film.",1531267200,,526,5.127906976744186

8705510,5,B00UEM9TY2,"An excellent movie, despite the inclusion of ""Lucky Chuckie"" (Radio Shock Jock)  as a constant irritant and reminder to edit around his obnoxious diatribes. I know there are people like that,  embedded in our world, but why do we have to endure them in good movies like this? His character adds nothing to the story and just pours cold water on an otherwise warm exploration of people loving, learning and growing in their lives. Rik Swartzwelder wrote an excellent screenplay (and did some understated but powerful acting)  depicting complex people with bad and good in their souls, but the radio shock jock just blathers on, poisoning the atmosphere. I haven't watched a movie this powerful in a long time. Too bad there is a huge zit on the enigmatic face of this Mona Lisa.",1528848000,,777,4.7835820895522385
8705511,5,B00UEM9TY2,Thank you. You've made a movie that my daughter can watch with her boyfriend & actually help her grow a relationship with instead of add pressures to it. That's all I can add.,1528243200,,175,4.333333333333333
