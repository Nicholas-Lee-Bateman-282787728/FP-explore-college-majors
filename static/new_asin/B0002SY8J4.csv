8031482,4,B0002SY8J4,"For anyone who loved Knots Landing this mini-series is terrific. Best of all it brings back Donna Mills as Abby Fairgate Cunningham Ewing Sumner and reunites her with William Devane as Gregory Sumner. The pairing is fantastic! This couple really made one of the longest-running series on television compelling.
