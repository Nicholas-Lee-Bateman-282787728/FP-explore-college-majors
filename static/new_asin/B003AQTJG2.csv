4104397,4,B003AQTJG2,"Writer/director/producer/musical scorer/actress Julie Delpy brings to the screen a character from history that few know.  The film is based on the true history of the woman known as The Blood Countess, but after viewing this film it is obvious that the actual figure on whom the story is based was a brilliant political mind, a woman of noble breeding who could read and write in four languages, who once widowed was able to successfully defend her lands from the warring Turks and exact control over the reigning Hungarian King Matthias. But back to the history of the character as written by Delpy.  'Countess Elizabeth B&aacute;thory de Ecsed (B&aacute;thory Erzs&eacute;bet in Hungarian) (1560 - 1614) was a countess from the renowned B&aacute;thory family of Hungarian nobility. She is considered the most prolific female serial killer in history and possibly the most prolific of any gender. She and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls, with one witness attributing to them over 650 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Erzs&eacute;bet herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later. Later writings about the case have led to legendary accounts of the Countess bathing in the blood of virgins in order to retain her youth.'

The film opens with voice over by Istv&aacute;n Thurz&oacute; (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) who relates the story of his only love. We are privy to the strange behaviors of the young Erzs&eacute;bet who had a sadistic streak and was at birth promised to be the bride of Ferenc N&aacute;dasdy (Charly H&uuml;bner). She became a beautiful woman and Erzs&eacute;bet (Julie Delpy) married General N&aacute;dasdy, gave birth to children, and together they were the power couple of Hungary.  When N&aacute;dasdy dies, Erzs&eacute;bet meets and falls passionately in love with Istv&aacute;n Thurz&oacute; (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), a many 19 years her junior, but Istvan's father Gy&ouml;rgy Thurz&oacute; (William Hurt) prevents Istvan from remaining with Erzs&eacute;bet.  Left alone Erzs&eacute;bet remains a powerful warrior, dallies with the sadomasochistic Dominic Vizakna (Sebastian Blomberg), but fears her young lover will forget her if she ages.  She discovers that the blood from virgins will restore her youth and thus begins the serial killings to support her vanity.  As questions of debts owed to her by the King there is an investigation of her personal history led by Gy&ouml;rgy Thurz&oacute;  and without proper trial she is condemned to house arrest in darkened sealed rooms in her own Csejte Castle where her fate is sealed.

The film is beautifully designed, costumed, photographed and scored, and Delpy manages to pace her story credibly and well.  For this viewer there is an absence of gritty passion that would make the history more indelible: Delpy and the remainder of the cast fail to create fiery on-screen chemistry that would have brought a sense of stronger impetus to the heinous acts that occur. But as a piece of rarely known history it is a fascinating film about a strong woman of the past and the impact she had on her country ... and on legends!

4104403,1,B003AQTJG2,"I skipped through the more gruesome parts eager to get to conclusion. The medieval period was depicted well, but time was not well spent watching this sordid story.",1401321600,,164,4.892857142857143
4104404,1,B003AQTJG2,"I did not complete this film. The director seemed to be substituting vicious bloody scenes for pertinent story content.
The main character had no redeeming qualities that caused any interest in what happened to her.",1401062400,,215,5.171428571428572
4104405,1,B003AQTJG2,"This was the most terrible movie I have seen in a long time. The acting was horrible, and the storytelling was awful. It will be a very long time, if ever, that I will see another movie made by, or staring Julie Delpy. There is nothing about this movie that is recommendable.",1400976000,,275,4.3076923076923075
4104406,4,B003AQTJG2,"Love, lust, envy, greed... and gluttony, Hungarian style! Great costumes, great script, great story... and Julie Delpy also wrote the music?  The story inhabits two plausible plot lines. The first is the legend of the bloodthristy countess, drunk and decadent with power.  The second, is a jealous king who begrudges his debts to the wealthy countess, begrudges that fact that she is richer than he, that she is fighting his wars for him, that she is a woman.  What better way to put down a rival noble that outshines you than to invent a monstrous story.  Witchcraft, I tell you!",1400976000,,580,4.77
4104407,5,B003AQTJG2,"This was quite an experience. The acting was splendid. Enjoyed watching the plot played out. It reminded me what's really important in life. Worth the time spent watching,",1400889600,,171,5.142857142857143
4104408,1,B003AQTJG2,"Having an interest in European history, particularly British, I thought this would be an interesting period piece, paralleling James 1.
Instead, it turned out to be one bed scene after another. After about 15 minutes, I turned it off.
If you are interested in history, don't waste your time on this movie.
If, on the other hand, your interests lie in the vapid, prurient boob-shots, this may be the movie for you.",1400630400,,413,4.75
4104409,1,B003AQTJG2,"I should have read the reviews.  It seemed like a feminist costume drama in the summary, but it's a gothic bordering on horror.  Wooden narration, stilted delivery of characters in scenes--probably because most of it seems looped later in a studio.  Daniel Bruhl as the love interest Istvan seems too effeminate to have engendered her lunacy in his rejection of her (that was staged by his father).  Nothing likable about the protagonist.  I didn't have a stomach for the bloodletting.",1400544000,,485,5.0125

4104415,4,B003AQTJG2,"Wasn't expecting the ending. This was a horror story without total gore. I am not into horror movies and had no idea of the story line however as the story unfolded, I was intrigued and hooked until the end leading me to want to do further research on the character.",1399680000,,266,4.34
4104416,1,B003AQTJG2,"I casually started watching this movie because of the actress, Julie Delpy. I said, hmmm, a historical drama with a strong female lead, sounds good to me. Looking back, I wish I had read the reviews as I find when I have a recollection of this film hideous images fill my head and creep me out. I did not finish watching it and what I did see I wish I could erase.",1399075200,,364,4.069444444444445
4104417,1,B003AQTJG2,"The description that is provided leads a prospective watcher to expect that the story line will actually have the Countesss strength of character and indomitable sense of self worth as woman overcoming male dominated biases to contribute significantly to the struggle against the encroaching Turks. Instead of that, the ultimate dominant theme seems to be a vain attempt on her part to stave off the ravages of encroaching age by use of the blood of a succession of murdered virgins.

Since my tastes don't run to the vampire, werewolf, etc., genre, I found the watching experience both disappointing andfor the last half of the filmvery boringdespite writing and acting that's a cut above the moronic entertainment fodder that characterizes the usual late Saturday evening ""Creature Feature"" type of fare.",1399075200,2,806,5.248062015503876
4104418,3,B003AQTJG2,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

""Snow White"" was not able to portray the true nature of a woman in search of eternal beauty, hence, her evil nemesis was far removed from the end product of virginal perfection. Not the case for this deplorable inquisition of age and virtue. Being unfamiliar with Delpy's uncanny abilities in the realm of all that is film, I was overwhelmed with her many contributions to such an intractable historical conveyance.

My first reaction was how does organic matter create powerful enzymes to effect a youthful appearance? Silly girl, however a poignant aspect of the narrative. Provide me, at least, the ingredients of the witches broth that defines silken softness? I will have many less complaints of accents, sullen sex scenes, miscasting and score.

I will complement the introduction of the ""God made Man in His Image"" and its transpose, but the more impressive allegory was that of the glorified man in battle. Very poignant and relevant today as that Commandment from Moses is most deviously interpreted for judicious use in greed and power.

I applaud Delpy's provocations of this display of deeds undone and recommend for the more refined film reviewer.",1398988800,,1202,5.055555555555555

4104421,5,B003AQTJG2,"she was great in this movie.  She played such a great part and made the countess come alive!  Very scary too.  unfortunately, although this is not a true story, this could have been a true story.",1398729600,,195,4.361111111111111
4104422,4,B003AQTJG2,"When I picked this movie, I had no idea what it was about. I was thinking it was going to be a romantic historical drama. Boy was I wrong and right all in one! By the time I realized there was a lot if gore I couldn't stop watching!",1398729600,,232,3.7551020408163267

4104424,3,B003AQTJG2,"Historically accurate? Not by any stretch of the imagination.

However, I do recommend this to those who have no idea who Elizabeth Bathory was in history.  I think it might make people after watching the movie go and look up more information on her history and compare it to the movie.

Finally, Julie Delpy is a great actress.  She had very little to work with in regards to the script but I would have liked to see someone else do better.",1398124800,,441,4.407407407407407
4104425,1,B003AQTJG2,"I was truly disappointed in the story which deviates so far from commonly accepted facts of her life.  For example, her husband dies at least six years earlier in the film--and history suggests that he indulged her by building a torture chamber...  The film suggests insanity nurtured by a man seeking both power and money...  Never let the facts get in the way of a good story, but this is not even a good story because the woman herself is not particularly likeable.  For my wife and me, this was time not well spent.  (Incidentally, a good story can make a good movie even when it strays far from the historical facts--see Braveheart, for example, and check out it's time lines for the principals.)",1398124800,,701,4.620967741935484
4104426,5,B003AQTJG2,"This movie  shows what happens, when someone inherits a vast sum of money, then uses it to rise to power. Elizabeth Bathroy, is
that type of person, but along the way things take a turn, when she looks in a mirror, to wipe away some blood from her face, after striking one of her servants. She then becomes obsessed, with the idea that it seems to make her look young, than what she is.
However, along her murderous way obtaining blood from her victims  by various methods of torture, to use as her so called lotion of youth, she begans to be investigated for her crimes, which results in fatal end. The moral I find of this movie is, power has its price, which can be deadly.",1397520000,,676,4.31496062992126
4104427,4,B003AQTJG2,"Hungary royalty were depicted in a very brutal way in this movie. Slow at parts, but interesting study how upbringing affected the Countess.

4104429,4,B003AQTJG2,Good acting..interesting story. Julie Delpy did a marvelous job as someone lost to the entire world around her. Good job.,1396310400,,121,5.1
4104430,3,B003AQTJG2,.It appears to be a rare look into the life of a famous historical figure and turns into a horror story that has been around for ages and largely been discredited. Don't waste your time.,1396137600,,186,4.3428571428571425
4104431,2,B003AQTJG2,The acting was terrible and if this is based on true story...the darkness and cruelty was too much for me...pretty sick.,1396051200,,120,4.761904761904762

4104433,2,B003AQTJG2,Julie Delpy should direct and leave the acting to others. Her countess was dry and unlikable even as the villain. The other actors had nothing to work with in their scenes with her. They all sounded like students reading Shakespeare in a high school literature class. Costumes and scenes were good. I didn't watch the entire film; I used the bar at the bottom to skim through and watched less than half of it and still understood everything that went on. Not a film to watch on the sofa with popcorn.,1395014400,,500,4.5054945054945055
4104434,1,B003AQTJG2,too brutal...was not able to watch how horrible she was to people and so turned it off.

I am sorry I signed up for Amazon Prime...hope you change the selections to better than this. .,1395014400,,277,4.3076923076923075
4104435,1,B003AQTJG2,I stopped watching this after the first 30 minutes.  There was so much gratuitous violence and cruelty that I saw no reason to continue wasting my time.  The characters were wooden and the story line almost non-existent and served only to justify? the violence. Only if you enjoy seeing heads cut off and blood spurting everywhere would you want to waste your time.,1394841600,,365,4.777777777777778
4104436,4,B003AQTJG2,It started out interesting but ended up strange and a bit gory. It did keep my interest though since it's sort of a tragic love story.,1394755200,,134,4.1923076923076925
4104437,5,B003AQTJG2,"It is a great movie of around the 1600 century. How a countess has to rule her people and how she is hate by her neighboring male rulers, who conspirer against her to imprisoner on false charges.",1394323200,,195,4.297297297297297

4104440,5,B003AQTJG2,"I had reservations about viewing this film because I thought it would be just another of those blood & gore stories.  As it turned out, it wasn't all that bloody and if you like ""classic horror"" movies, this is one for you.  It is a film about desperate love, betrayal, greed, and revenge.  All the things that help to make up a really good plot.  The film takes place in 17th century Hungary at the time of the Turkish invasion of Eastern Europe.  The costumes are authentic to that period, coaches are correctly designed, the castles very impressive, having obviously been shot on location, and there is a certain sympathy for the arch-villianess due to the environment that help to mould her way of thinking and her tragic end.  The lovers, played by Daniel Bruehl of ""Krabat,""  Julie Delpy of Disney's ""The Three Musketeers,"" and William Hurt of ""Moby Dick,"" make up an experienced acting team whose performances really carry the film through to it end.",1392854400,,957,4.728915662650603

4104452,4,B003AQTJG2,The only reason i gave this movie a 4 is that it was hard to watch at times given the graphic nature of some of the scenes. Acting is good and story is a bit shocking. I just found the degree of human cruelty hard to look at and think about,1391472000,,240,3.7254901960784315
4104453,2,B003AQTJG2,"This movie has really made it clear that Julie Delpy can neither act nor direct. I believe that if you replaced the entire cast here with solid wood puppets, perhaps voiced by Microsoft Mike, the stiffness of acting and nuance of emotion would remain largely unchanged. This I find especially dissapointing coming from William Hurt who has proven on many an occasion to be very capable. The editing was also not great but you may not notice when trying to bare the awful line delivery. The costumes were okay but had that problem where everything looked just a little too clean for the period (i.e. not lived in).

So, after all this negativity, why not just one star? Well, I did make at all the way through the movie. It is an interesting story which deserves a real director and talented actors.",1391385600,,798,4.619718309859155

4104456,4,B003AQTJG2,"This movie has so many positive attributes, but the whole is not equal to, much less, greater, than its parts.
It has excellent production values. It concerns a time and place seldom portrayed in cinema. Casting is excellent, especially Julie Delpi. The story line is intriguing. I suppose editing may be its downfall - it suffers (we suffer) in the latter part of the movie as the inevitable ending is drawn out far too long. It has an air of Christian Anderson tales that draws one in.
The movie is well worth watching, if only for the costuming and set designs, and some interesting solutions to plot issues. I just felt that it would have benefitted by a reduction of 10-15 minutes (IMHO).",1391126400,,693,4.642276422764228

Apparently, the portrayal of her punishment is spot on, although I'm not sure if the film really conveys the sense that it was 4 years from the time she was ""sentenced"" until her death. If you like historical films, you will probably enjoy this. Not someone I had ever heard of before, but certainly a strange woman - if, in fact, she did what she is supposed to have done.

A lot of people have a misunderstanding of the medieval times. The movie did a great job representing the time. You can see that in her time women had rights and spoke their minds, the people in her time, didn't act that much different from us. You also got to see that the royals had less freedoms than the peasants. You could relate to any of the people in the movie. You get to see that Erzsbet was human as anyone else. She had many affairs with women and men. To the people that think homosexuality is newly invited thing. Think again! It's been around since forever.

The acting was superb. I do not know how historical accurate this movie about her life is, because there are some that don't think she did those crimes, and it all was made up to ruin her. I never found her that interesting, to kill with unjust reasoning as she did, just turns me off. But this movie makes you be the judge of her.

The movie portrays a great ruler, a very powerful woman that spiewhirls down to a very weak woman, who's obsess in staying young. The movie shows her lunatic quite well, to how she sees what she thinks the blood is doing to her, to what everyone sees. In the end her obessiness vanity is her downfall. I think her punishment was quite fitting for her, which I will not tell. Does this make me want to read about her? Yes. All in all a very good movie.",1387065600,,1618,4.333333333333333

""History is a tale told by the victors.
Who are the victors? Barbaric warriors, mad kings, and greedy traitors. Maybe most of our histories are made up of fables fabricated by those glorious victors.""

We do get the basic facts and unlike ""Bathory' which paints her as not a serial killer , this is probably more accurate.  The times were very dark indeed. the Austrian Hungarian empire was in a 200 year war basically with the turks who were out to conquer Europe. At the same time witch burnings, and the inquisition was in full force.  It was just a truly monstrous age of terror.  The husband of bathory was one of the empires greatest warriors and he is depicted that way. We do get a more sober type of countess here. In legend she has black masses and human sacrifices , but the reality is probably much more like this. She thinks blood makes her younger so she kills many young women to get their blood. It makes more sense than the sensational black masses and devil worship scenario. Whatever the truth , we do get to see a powerful woman that was hated for it. If she hadn't gone wacko she'd would be remembered for her greatness , not for her evil.  I think the lead actress nailed the cold countess perfectly , who is a sociopath and a product of her times. Only she is a true nightmarish figure of history even for her sinister age.  I don't understand the one star reviews complaining that this is violent sick movie. EH?

In the end, I felt more sorry for her.

Julie Delpy was outstanding as a director and actress. I have never heard of her before this movie, a fact which I deplored greatly. The film described the countess' dreadful action but managed to slip in the alternative explanation for the myth of the blood countess which was that the story was fabricated by a count, jealous of her power and wealth. It was about power, greed and the desire to dominate a strong and beautiful woman by using deception and her weakness for young handsome man.

Julie Delpy CANNOT act... from what I understand about her past movies it is no surprise to many.  Ms. Delpy reads her lines as though someone is behind her with a que card because the director can't get her to properly act out a single scene.

On the positive side, and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of less, was due to the great acting on the part of the others in the movie and that the story and script were very well crafted.  The scenary and costumes completely fit the era and times and though it is a dark and somewhat depressing type of movie it is still enticing enough to watch to the very end and still come up not feeling as though your time was completely ill spent.

If you can get past Julie Delpy's acting, you can enjoy the whole rest of the picture. I wouldn't go so far to purchase this movie, but if your a Prime member you can watch it for free, which in this case, I happened to be.

4104576,3,B003AQTJG2,"The Countess has a great premise in making the viewers visualize the story of Countess Elizabeth Bathory also called ""The Blood Countess"" and was said to be an inspiration for Dracula. Bathory's story is a fascinating one and I think what it makes it even more interesting is that we will likely never know the whole story and the truth (there's even the possibility that she was framed). Still, centuries after she died and committed atrocities rumors persist about Erzebet Bathory: did she commit those crimes? Approximately how many young virgins were killed? Obviously it's not a ""nice"" story; in fact it's a rather dark and evil one if you must know the truth.  The Countess is very much French actress Julie Delpy's brainchild for the most part as she wrote, directed and starred in its lead role.

I don't know what viewers were expecting given that this film is obviously more of an independent release than a major release one, the acting in The Countess is a tad dry but I don't think it's awful; the performances are not so bad for a relatively low budget movie. Obviously the movie is not historically accurate and is more of a re-imagining of Elizabeth's tale. I can understand why to complains but I can't recall many movies that tackle the tale of Bathory and this one while not superb is not awful by any means.  filmmaking wise it was a good move and shows a more human aspect to it that justifies the murders. I thought Julie Delpy made a brilliant Bathory in some ways and she portrays her as very cold and intelligent woman yet she is also mysterious and reserved as you would imagine but there's also the part of her that loved and still loves; the part that hurts when her heart was broken. Love was integrated in the movie as the reason she committed the crimes (with her accomplices of course) Although some are complaining that she's not acting as evil or possessed as they would've liked but obviously this isn't the Elizabeth Bathory they wanted to give to viewers this wasn't the angle they had in mind for her. The way I see it they wanted to show a more human angle to her and less folklore fantasy that have accompanied her tale for centuries now. But there's just that something that doesn't make her give a truly great performance, it's as if she's holding back or doing too much and there's very little I liked that they didn't go with the predictable bathing in blood thing, in the movie she is not seen bathing in blood although she does put her hands in it and put it on her face. To Delpy's credit it is a complicated role to portay and I thought she still did a good job. They would have done well to explore things like Elizabeth's childhood further and her education being that she knew many languages, how she tortured others (but in The Countess they show accomplices using a device that I don't think Bathory ever used as it seems she preferred to inflict the punishment herself, however, that would have been interesting to see) and her taking over where her husband left off for instance.

I think most of us would expect a more savage and ruthless Elizabeth Bathory from this film but instead what were getting here is a more psychological and perhaps more complicated approach to her. I must say I enjoyed the film but to be honest the running time is a bit short for a film on one of the greatest true horror stories the world has known. The Countess runs at an hour and 35 minutes and while it covers a lot of territory and most of what is important I thought it would have strongly beneficiated from at least an added 30 minutes or even perhaps potentially an hour. They could have explored her childhood more and developed certain aspects and elements further because at the end I felt it was short for such a story. Overall it doesn't end up being THE definitive film on the story of Countess Bathory and maybe that will come someday but its best we have so far and it's very enjoyable and not the worst independent film I have seen. I have had a fascination for Countess Elizabeth for some time now and although the film is not perfect it's certainly a good imagining of her story and her romance and the result is enjoyable. As a fictionalized account of Elizabeth Bathory it works well but some of the acting left a little something to desire and I was left with the feeling that the movie ended up being too short as I already mentioned.

4104578,4,B003AQTJG2,"The movie itself is very well done, historically well that depends on just how well the viewer is familiar with the history of Hungary, and their knowledge about the characters portrayed in the film.

Count Ferencz Nadasdy, Erzsebeth's husband was a feared War-Lord, and a General who fought the Turks, and supported the Habsburg King, but was not a blood thirsty person who sat on top of Turkish corpses and drank wine!  Nor was he so arrogant towards the King, as portrayed in the film!! Yes, he was extremely rich, powerful, and the King owed him a lot of money, for services rendered on the behalf of the Crown. The King's Treasury was unable to fund and pay for the wages of the soldiers to fight the Turks, and Count Nadadsy loaned the sums to the Crown used his own resources to pay for cost of war.

Count Gyorgy Thurzo, was the Palentine, Viceroy of the Kingdom of Hungary, or what was left of Hungary during the Turkish occupation and constant wars. Thurzo was a shrewd, power and money hungry person with great political influence at the Court of the Habsburg King. Thurzo was not from the old noble stock, but gained his nobility through marriage and of commerce.

Countess Erzsebet Bathory, was old nobility. Her relatives included the Chief Justice of Hungary, the King of Poland (Istvan Bathory), and the Prince of Transilvania. She was also protestant and not catholic. She was extremely wealthy on her own, and when she married the Count Nadasdy, their combined wealth made them the largest landowners and the wealthiest nobles in Hungary at the time.

Erzsebet Bathory, was no saint for sure, she was intelligent, head strong, fearless, and very well educated when females usually were not. She was also a loving mother. She had five children with her husband, two died at very young age, which was very common in those days. Her marriage was arranged and was not based upon love, but to keep the families wealthy and powerful. Count Nadasdy was away most of the time fighting the Turks after his death she was even more isolated than before. While she was no raving beauty, she needed a man in her love life, and had several lovers.  Was she vain and only worried about her fading beauty? Aren't most females? They certainly keep all the cosmetic companies and plastic surgeons very rich!!! This was before such; she tried and used other methods such as herbs and herb baths to keep her skin supple.

In reality there was a power struggle, between the Crown (Habsburgs) and the anti-Habsburg Hungarian leaders, Catholics and Protestants,  the Habsburg Crown against the Turks and a few other factions thrown into this toxic mix! Let's not forget a bit of greed, envy, vanity and such sins.

What is the truth? Was she a blood sucking, deranged murderer who had young virgins killed in order to bathe in their blood? Or she was innocent powerful, head strong wealthy protestant woman (who secretly supported her nephew in an anti Habsburg rebellion, anti catholic) who was by all these traits dangerous to the Crown, who was trialed unjustly not even front of a Court, but by a signed order by the catholic King, obtained by the Palentine for their own personal gain!

She was above the Law.  She had the ""Pallos Jog"" a term which reserved for extremely high and old nobility in Hungary. She had the right to kill any of her servants or even lesser nobility without any punishment who lived on her lands, as they were her property.

By having a judgment and warrant against her signed by the King, the King did not had to repay all the monies that he owed to the family and she forfeited some of her lands to the Crown, given to Thurzo, and the remaining went to her son.  The Crown witnesses and accusers for the trial were her servants. These servants were uneducated and full of superstitions, and their testimony by the way, were obtained by torture. They would say anything including that she practiced witchcraft, drank blood, bathed in blood and they saw her killing young girls, she was a lesbian, a devil lover and etc. Thus a myth of her was fabricated and it was left to the superstitious ignorance which was so rampant to spread, with some well place propaganda by the Palentine, to this day. To all who do not know the reality she remains a monster, a blood sucking vampire. While in reality she was more of a tragic character who lived in a loveless relationship while married, she could had marry again but she did not wanted to marry any lesser nobility to give her immense wealth away. She was too wealthy, too powerful, too head strong for her own good, with a large dose of vanity about her aging body. Was she sadistic, mean? She was distant and she was above the Law, she knew that, but she loved her own children, and could show affection towards other children, as this was shown in the movie, sort of.

The myth states that she was walled into a room. However, that was not the case. She was confined to her castle at Csejte, accused of being a monster, where she died shortly at the age of 54.

However, one thing that was absolutely correctly stated in the movie ""History is tale told by the victors"" and the victors in this case were the Crown and the Palentine, Count Thurzo.",1341446400,2,5221,4.617044228694714

4104580,1,B003AQTJG2,"For a movie about blood, The Countess is surprisingly lacking in passion. The characters seem distant and it is very difficult to believe this countess, so ruthless and successful as a power broker and commander of both king and armies, was tragically consumed over a jilting by her young lover--enough to bleed virgins in an attempt to regain a youthful vigor.

The story is unconvincing and, also, a puzzling misrepresentation of the circumstances that produced one of history's most infamous serial killers. Although I heard first about Bathory from this movie, on looking further, it seems The Countess is fictitious not only in terms of the warped romantic justification for her killings, but the machinations behind her rise to power is downplayed, as is social context of her cruelty, and the complicity of servants and family members. Even the tools she chose to kill and torture are apparently fictitious.

So with lackluster acting and sickening scenes of depravity that are merely cinematic invention and not compelled by real events, the film is a disappointing waste of resources. Delpy would have done better to explore Bathory's ruthlessness and cunning, and her cruelty, which apparently evolved openly and while her husband still lived, not opportunistically after he died.  It would also be revealing to see the countess within the context of her depraved family, who intermarried to preserve their fortunes, but actively undermined each other's interests. Erzabet's depravities were apparently schooled by observing disgustingly inhuman acts perpetrated by numerous others in her extended family.

I gave the movie one star merely for piquing the viewer's interest in learning what is really known about this historic psychopath.",1337558400,48,1748,5.368613138686132

4104584,4,B003AQTJG2,"Julie Delpy wrote, produced, directed and starred in this perhaps somewhat-fictionalized historical account of the Countess Erzebet Bathory (1560-1614), an infamous, noble Hungarian widowed by her warlord Count.  This historical figure has been known as the Blood Countess and Countess Dracula, has been compared to Vlad III (Vlad the Impaler), and was loosely associated with witchcraft.

From early childhood through marriage, and leading to the death of her husband, Erzebet (Julie Delpy) is painted with all the makings of a ""typical"" noblewoman with ""typical"" white-people-problems of the time.  We see the potential for both compassion and cold sociopathy in the future of this powerful and highly intelligent woman.

 In her late thirties Erzebet meets and fancies Istvan (Daniel Brhl), a young noble and the son of Count Gyorgy Thurzo (William Hurt) whose recent advances she denied.  Young Istvan is quite sincerely taken with Erzebet, as is she with him.  But she finds herself transfixed on his fine skin and, ill-comparably, her aging skin (as she is nearly twenty years his senior).  Little did she know that Gyorgy would use her love for Istvan against her for years to come.

 After promises to be together, Erzebet waits for Istvan.  She becomes obsessed with ""looking worn and old"" and resigns herself to continuous fasting and prayer until Istvan answers her.  Later, actions of self loathing, self mutilation, and bondage fuel her descent into madness.  After some provocative suggestions from a vamp-like nobleman and a random household accident, she learns to find comfort in the rejuvenating properties of virgins' blood.  Her young handmaid plays the scapegoat of this psychosis as she is periodically drained.  As time passes, Erzebet's addiction to sanguineous cosmetics increases and so follows the body count with her state of mania.

 The film is presented with a strong feministic tone in support of Erzebet's integrity and actions despite her psychosis, as if told by Erzebet as an autobiography.  Delpy was fantastic.  Much as with Anonymous, an admirable job was done with a limited (i.e., non-Blockbuster) budget.  The cinematography and wardrobe were fantastic.  The set design should be noted for effort, but it takes a big budget to properly emulate the grandeur of nobility in period films.

4104590,4,B003AQTJG2,"Writer/director/producer/musical scorer/actress Julie Delpy brings to the screen a character from history that few know. The film is based on the true history of the woman known as The Blood Countess, but after viewing this film it is obvious that the actual figure on whom the story is based was a brilliant political mind, a woman of noble breeding who could read and write in four languages, who once widowed was able to successfully defend her lands from the warring Turks and exact control over the reigning Hungarian King Matthias. But back to the history of the character as written by Delpy. 'Countess Elizabeth Bthory de Ecsed (Bthory Erzsbet in Hungarian) (1560 - 1614) was a countess from the renowned Bthory family of Hungarian nobility. She is considered the most prolific female serial killer in history and possibly the most prolific of any gender. She and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls, with one witness attributing to them over 650 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Erzsbet herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later. Later writings about the case have led to legendary accounts of the Countess bathing in the blood of virgins in order to retain her youth.'

The film opens with voice over by Istvn Thurz (Daniel Brhl) who relates the story of his only love. We are privy to the strange behaviors of the young Erzsbet who had a sadistic streak and was at birth promised to be the bride of Ferenc Ndasdy (Charly Hbner). She became a beautiful woman and Erzsbet (Julie Delpy) married General Ndasdy, gave birth to children, and together they were the power couple of Hungary. When Ndasdy dies, Erzsbet meets and falls passionately in love with Istvn Thurz (Daniel Brhl), a many 19 years her junior, but Istvan's father Gyrgy Thurz (William Hurt) prevents Istvan from remaining with Erzsbet. Left alone Erzsbet remains a powerful warrior, dallies with the sadomasochistic Dominic Vizakna (Sebastian Blomberg), but fears her young lover will forget her if she ages. She discovers that the blood from virgins will restore her youth and thus begins the serial killings to support her vanity. As questions of debts owed to her by the King there is an investigation of her personal history led by Gyrgy Thurz and without proper trial she is condemned to house arrest in darkened sealed rooms in her own Csejte Castle where her fate is sealed.

The film is beautifully designed, costumed, photographed and scored, and Delpy manages to pace her story credibly and well. For this viewer there is an absence of gritty passion that would make the history more indelible: Delpy and the remainder of the cast fail to create fiery on-screen chemistry that would have brought a sense of stronger impetus to the heinous acts that occur. But as a piece of rarely known history it is a fascinating film about a strong woman of the past and the impact she had on her country ... and on legends!

4104591,2,B003AQTJG2,"Actors should not direct themselves in movies (Clint Eastwood the only exception) and this proves the Rule. Julie Delpy wrote a halfway decent script but she needed outside Leadership to bring out the True spirit and Life of Erzebet Bathory. The acting was wooden and without life, and the script and supporting roles without depth. This could have been an amazing movie, maybe even Oscar worthy--true life, amazing settings and costumes, interesting story. But the direction and cinematography, the editing, made this a mediocre film barely worthy of note. Too bad. The life of Erzebet Bathory, the first recorded female serial killer, is one of the great mysteries of history and certainly worthy of better. I suggest you wait until Amazon drops the rental price to $1.99, or until Hollywood puts this in the hands of a better actress and director, before watching a movie about the Amazing Erzebet Bathory",1319932800,2,908,5.06
4104592,5,B003AQTJG2,"This is not a film for the faint of heart. It is unforgiving and tough to watch at times, though beautiful and moving; it is a tour de force performance by the splendid Julie Delpy. Highly recommended. Not easily forgotten.",1319846400,2,223,4.6
4104593,5,B003AQTJG2,"Julie Delpy writes, directs and stars in ""The Countess"", a tale loosely based on the infamous Hungarian Countess Erzebet Bathory (also known as Elisabeth Bathory).
The director wanted the audience to look at the life and tribulations of the countess through a female lens, while trying to banish all those perceptions of Bathory being evil into something that has nothing to do with witchcraft and the dark side at all, but it is actually the countess descents into madness because of her lover and her enemies.

I think Julie Delpy has achieved that and she is perfect in her role as the normal-turned-to-a-madwoman Countess Erzebet Bathory. You can see she loves life, her subjects and after the mourning of her husband's passing, she does seem normal until she meet Istvan Thurzo (Daniel Brhl). She fall madly in love with him although he is much, much younger than her.

Still, Istvan loves her too. And that's when the problem starts as people begin to talk and Istvan's father (William Hurt as Gyorgy Thurzo) whom earlier tries to win the heart of the countess but failed now has a very intricate and evil plans to ruin the countess. From here on you can see how these plans drive the countess to the edge of madness.

I applaud Miss Julie Delpy for her great works in this film. Very underrated in the festival circuits, sadly. This movie is very talky, but the reward when the film finishes tastes as fresh as the young virgin's blood.",1316908800,27,1443,4.718253968253968

4104597,5,B003AQTJG2,"Taking the stance that history is told by the victor, this tale of ""the Blood Count"" looks at her life both as a romantic tale and also as a tale of tragedy. First you see the woman and her life as a maried woman, then as a pwerful figure, then a social giant, then a lover, then a fiarytale, and finally a shatter enigma. It is all told from the lips of one that was there, and the tale is something of a cautionary one and also one that seems pained and heatfelt. This makes it different, remarkably so, and something that interests more than the normal persons that might otherwise find themselves watching a story on this particular subject.

From costuming to the way the subject is spun, this is rewarding. True, it is not the way you would normally see this subject but that is not a bad thing. Breaking with tradition can be strong and, looking into what it says, an interesting stance. It has a way with thoughts and a way with perspectives, putting us just slightly out of reach of truly knowing. It does not make excuses, offering instead obsession as a remark for murder, and it does not coat the subect. Perhaps it is not as bleak as some other ventures into this idea, but it is nonetheless dark.
