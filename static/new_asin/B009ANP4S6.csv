5309532,2,B009ANP4S6,"The year 2012 sure is getting a raw deal when it comes to being associated with catastrophic events. First, we're speeding towards the end of the Mayan calendar which supposedly signifies the coming of the apocalypse. Now the Asylum marks the actual beginning of the end as ""12/12/12.""

Armageddon might occur on December 21st, but the official kick-off begins on the 12th when the son of the Devil is born. At least that's what this over-the-top and completely disgusting low -budget mix of ""It's Alive,"" ""Grace,"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" wants us to believe.

Baby Sebastian's birth on December 12, 2012 is marked with tragedy from the moment he arrives in the delivery room. The doctors delivering the baby are brutally and inexplicably murdered. After taking the newborn home, it becomes evident to mother Veronica that something is very wrong with her child. Death seems to surround him wherever he is. She soon realizes Sebastian is the child of Satan and will fully embrace his evil calling on December 21st.

As a movie, I have to say that ""12/12/12"" isn't all that badly paced or put together. There are still the amateurish camera angles and bad acting we're all used to with the Asylum's movies. What ruins this is its mission to push the envelope of tastelessness as far as they can and get away with it. I'm all about giving the audience something shocking they can drop their jaws at, but they go way too far in my opinion.

Let me give you just a few examples of sections of the film where I was looking away and closing my eyes in abhorrence. They show the demonic child coming out of the woman's private parts. You want to talk about causing someone to never want to undergo natural childbirth. Now add a highly inappropriate incestuous situation between the mother and child. Top it off with a rather graphic rape scene and you get a good idea of the sort of quality you can expect from ""12/12/12.""

I love horror movies and enjoy the ""Satanic Panic"" films of the 1970s and 1980s just as much as the next fan does. I understand why the Asylum felt the need to exploit such foul matter. Many genre fans are always looking for someone to push the visual limits of gore and violence. The Asylum wanted to get those people's attention. I just think there are certain places you don't go and many of them were visited in ""12/12/12.""

Movies like ""12/12/12"" make me angry. I enjoyed the idea of the movie going into it. It sounded like a fun little flick that would scare up memories of several other classic films I've appreciated. It turned out to be a completely joyless experience I found myself abhorred by. I actually turned it off and then decided to watch the entire thing so I could properly review it and warn potential viewers about it before they see anything they'll never be able to unsee.",1355443200,9,2812,4.625250501002004
5309533,1,B009ANP4S6,"You take a crappy screenplay and shoddy direction, really bad effects and makeup, lousy acting, put them all together and sell them to Asylum, a company that specializes in dreck like this.  It is not at all scary and the creepy baby is one whose face nobody even seems to notice!",1355443200,,280,4.490196078431373
5309534,1,B009ANP4S6,"I'm not sure if this movie was poorly written or poorly edited. Probably both. The acting was very bad too. This movie left me very confused like I had dozed off and missed something. There was one scene where a guy gets killed and it's never acknowledged, like it was a scene that was supposed to be cut out but they forgot. I think a couple of friends got together and decided to make a movie just because they could but ran out of money half way through. It was painful to watch to the end but it was already paid for. If I could give it no stars, I would. Please don't waste your money. Some horror movies are so stupid, they're laughable. This movie was not even that.",1367884800,,673,4.184615384615385
5309535,3,B009ANP4S6,"The idea behind it was good. The execution not so much.

Their first mistake was the baby. We never see it unwrapped (sheets) and the very few times we did see it it looked about as amaturish as you can get. Granted I'm sure they couldn't find or use a real life baby for the closeups, but still. I'm sure they wanted it to look ugly.....most babies are ha.

Second: The attacks...sigh...if this were a Chucky Doll sure it makes more sense, comes alive when it chooses too and carefully kills everyone. here the baby kills everyone vampire style. The other deaths i never understood. Seems anyone who comes near the baby is possesed into killing themselves....except the sister and detective. why?

The acting from the entire cast isn't bad. Some didn't do as well as others, but I think the script could take the blame on that.

Some questionalble moments like the deaths in the hospital. Why wasn't the mother arrested? In reality she would have been. Second why did the mother keep the baby knowing it kills? Third, how is her sister and the detective and the creepy guy the only ones to live after coming in contact with baby?

I watched the film mainly and only to see some of my favorite actress'. The film overall is not terrible. Hey I have amazon prime trust me theres alot of worse movies out there that'll make this one look like a box office hit.",1366848000,,1358,4.504065040650406

5309538,1,B009ANP4S6,"This isn't even a ""B"" movie this must be  ""D"" or ""F"".

First of all, I am damn glad I got this out of the ""Big Red Box"" because it was only a dollar, but still it's a wasted dollar because I took this back immediately. I can't believe they spent money to make this.

Let's forget about the fact that it's far from original. That much I expected with the slew of movies about Doomsday and evil children. With that said, why on planet Earth would these people release a movie where the baby looks absolutely awful? I mean at least try to fool us with something that could pass for a real baby. This baby looks like a monster to start with, and you mean to tell me she was surprised the baby was an offspring of the devil. Correction, the baby looks like a doll she's holding, and you can see it. They didn't even try to hide it, it was obvious, it was right there in the camera. The acting was absolutely abysmal. Again, no big shocker there. The last straw was when they showed this monster watching his so-called parents making love and in the next scene you see vulgar relations happening between this child and mother, and that's putting it nicely. I was done after that. The director had to be one sick individual to agree to tape something like that garbage. The screen-writer's were sick for writing it. I don't know what they were trying to prove, or if they were going for shock value, but they failed miserably. I don't think there's one good thing I can say about this movie. In fact, I couldn't even finish this crap, and the only reason I gave it a chance to begin with is because I have been pleasantly surprised in the past by some ""B"" rated movies. Too bad I can't say the same about this one.

On top of that, the main guy, or the so-called villian (couldn't even tell you what his name was) was absolutely awful. I wonder who owed him a favor because he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.",1362182400,2,1910,4.239010989010989
5309539,1,B009ANP4S6,Soooooooo bad couldn't even finish it. Wrong for a company to have even produced it! Everything from acting to story line and visuals  hokey.,1360713600,,141,4.875
5309540,1,B009ANP4S6,"This moving does not begin to describe the total waste of time. Bad acting, directing, editing, photography. Tell me, did people actually get paid for putting out this garbage?",1359936000,,176,5.103448275862069
5309541,1,B009ANP4S6,"This movie has got to be the WORST movie I have ever seen in my whole life of any genre. The plot is bad, the script is bad, the acting is bad, the props are bad, the camera is bad, and the music is bad. The ONLY thing the movie has to offer are the full breasts of the baby's mother. But after a few minutes, even this effect gets boring. 12/12/12 is the date of a rotten tomotoe, a loser, a -5 star rating, 5 thumbs down.",1358899200,,423,3.8181818181818183
5309542,1,B009ANP4S6,"Doesn't anybody remember the ""Omen"" series of the 1970s in which a baby named Damien Thorne is born and grows up to be the Antichrist? The series was no great shakes as movies go except to instill gratuitous horror in the audience, but it does happen to have been the Original. Predating ""Left Behind"", and for sure predating this bit of thinly-disguised plagiarism.",1356566400,,366,4.825396825396825
8538633,1,B009ANP4S6,"A young couple have a baby but they find that it is a child of evil.

I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this film. It feels as through someone had an idea but absolutely no further thoughts about how it would be translated to the screen. There is no coherent explanation as to how the wife became pregnant with this 'child' or who the real father is. Nothing really happens in the film except dozens of murders (all badly realised). There doesn't seem to be much in the way of a script - it seems to be pretty much ad-libbed, the result being far too much unnecessary swearing for the sake of swearing and not a lot else. The acting is high school level, but maybe this is because of the lack of direction provided by the 'Director'.

The development of the story is amateurish and distasteful - we just end up with a baby killing everyone in sight. The baby is also portrayed as a particularly ugly Yoda, making the whole thing laughable.

I bought this (more the fool me) on Blu-ray and it is an Asylum standard good presentation (for all the good that does) and it has a decent DTS-HD MA audio track.

But all up this is an awful film with questionable content and really nothing to recommend it.",1483574400,,1227,4.368421052631579
8538634,5,B009ANP4S6,"I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews on here. It's an asylum movie, so I don't know what people expected. They are constantly putting out controversial movies and while some of their material seems silly / immoral to some people, other syfy / horror movie fanatics like myself love it! This movie is kind of like the serious version of Hell Baby. For the record I loved that movie as well. Sara Malakul Lane is easily my favorite sci fi movie actress and her role in this movie is one of her best. It's good to know that she is not a snobby actress who refuses to do nude scenes because it is demeaning to women.",1453420800,,628,4.3760683760683765

8538636,5,B009ANP4S6,"Judging by the other reviews, I might be wrong here, but I think that 12/12/12 might be the next Birdemic. Just like that movie, this is so bad that it's wonderful. I can't believe more people didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. I howled with laughter often, and the movie is also plenty gory. And I can't forget to mention that there is also some nice nudity. It's as if I saw a different movie than everyone else.

It's true what the other reviews say...the movie is horrible in every aspect.
Five stars for the best acting performance (the one minute of angel Erin O'Brien...who, if u don't know, is the nurse at the desk at the beginning of the movie)
One star for the rest of the laughable b.s.
So I suppose it averages out to two stars. Maybe.",1402790400,,412,4.1625
8538638,1,B009ANP4S6,Please don't waste your time and money on this horribly lame movie.  I'm ashamed I bought this thinking it would be a fair horror movie.  If you like bad movies that are so bad it's actually a little funny then you might enjoy this.  The effects aren't that impressive at all.  Abort buying this or renting at all costs.,1396569600,,320,4.372881355932203
8538639,1,B009ANP4S6,"My heart sank when I saw the ""Asylum"" logo popping up. These are the people that make the sort of stuff that ends up on the idiotically-named SyFy Channel - Siamese sharks, that sort of thing. In fact, from the montage of clips, I saw only one that I'd seen that was worth anything at all. Don't be gulled, it was worth very little.
Anyway, woman gives birth to Devil Baby which promptly kills the two attending doctors and spends the movie trotting around LA or somewhere looking for it. It's a pretty deserted LA or somewhere, something we should note well. Baby winds up in the hands of a guy with tattoos on his face and that's about it.
The body count rises in direct proportion to the temptation to turn this mess off. Rotten script, peppered with such profundities as ""You effing bitch"" (wow...) helps to anchor this awful film to the bedrock of mindlessness whence it sprang. Terrible acting and lame direction make sure that it sinks.
The baby itself is an absolute horror. It's a plastic thing with no moving parts and it grows horns at the end. It goes for the jugular which means that its intended victims have to writhe and make some sort of effort to make it look like they are trying to pull the damn' thing off. Good luck with that.
By the way, right at the end, the mother's t shirt is torn, exposing her boobs. When the film FINALLY grinds to a halt, it is in one piece. While we're on the subject, note the hideous boob job scars on the sacrificial victim at the start. UGH.
If you watch the ""Extras,"" it's apparent that no-one involved in this has the slightest degree of self-consciousness. I can't say it's a pity because whether this had been played for laughs or not, everything about this reeks of childish amateurishness. Enough said. Put this on a double bill with 13/13/13 and you've got three hours of the very worst ever committed to celluloid.
Wait, with the advent of 2014, I'm sure some idiot will have an epiphany and realise that if he made 14/14/14, he could market a trilogy. There's always someone stupid enough.",1388275200,,2050,4.498659517426273

8538641,1,B009ANP4S6,This was a very disappointing movie to watch and think I should be reimbursed because it was soooooo bad! I didn't even want to watch to whole movie because it was that bad.,1371945600,,173,4.2727272727272725
8538642,4,B009ANP4S6,"This is one of the worse films made by Asylum. I am a lover of their bad films and this one tickled my funny bone.

The DVD cover similar to ""Rosemary's Baby"" leaves no mystery as to the identity of the baby. The film opens with a Mayan calendar, some Bible verses, and words spoken about pharaohs just to cover all the bases. Our ""Damien"" or Sebastian in this case is born C-section, the kind of C-section where they use no anesthetic and the mother (Sara Malakul Lane) cries in pain.

Our infant, which looks like an ugly prop from a David Lynch film, was apparently inspired by the bunny in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" as he can fly around and grab people by the jugular with his long razor sharp teeth. In spite of the kid having teeth and clearing out the birthing room in a deadly fashion, mom ignores it all and opts to breast feed...ouch!

12/12/12 is something that is used by a doomsday cult, most likely because my nephew born on 6/6/66 is boring and sells insurance.

The detective (Steve Hanks) has a fondness for lollipops...Oh where did the writers come up with that?!

This is a low budget film that goes absolutely no where. The plot doesn't flow well and is haphazard. The dialouge and acting was bad, but if you are going to use bad actors, rule of thumb is to use pretty D-cup women so us guys won't care...thanks Asylum.

This is a great film for bad Asylum film lovers as the budget and special effects are worse than usual.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, rape, nudity (Sara Malakul Lane, Bonnie Grinberg) 4-5 stars for Asylum fans, 1 star for non-fans.",1368144000,,1580,4.446366782006921
