6096960,5,B00GOVRVTM,"I already bought this dvd from amazon.co.uk, and watched it.

I was pretty impressed.  It has a dark brutality that just screams out at you, and many of the scenes were darkly terrifying.

I also learned that clowns are made of people, and therefore you shouldn't kill clowns.

I heard this was the new Blade Runner.  I can see some similarities, but this is not a replacement for Blade Runner.  It is a good dark movie about a dark future.  I laughed at bits of it, because parts of it are quite clever.",1397174400,10,504,4.354838709677419
6096961,5,B00GOVRVTM,"'Blade Runner' is my favorite movie of all time, and I never thought anyone would succeed creating anything that captured its mood, themes, style, and substance. 'The Machine' does this incredibly well. So well, that it's not fair to compare it to 'Blade Runner'; instead, I'll say that it's the perfect companion to the classic noir sci-fi flick, and more recent AI/robot/cyborg fare such as 'Ghost in the Shell'.

And keep an eye out for Caity Lotz; I think we'll be seeing lots more from this hauntingly talented actress, and I cannot wait.",1397088000,4,543,4.838709677419355
6096962,4,B00GOVRVTM,"The first movie of the year (2014) about the Technological Singularity is sometimes familiar but comes to interesting conclusions. If we humans as flawed creators create Technological Children and visit our sins upon them, how might they react? Stylistic, sometimes melodramatic, generally concerned more with ideas than action, The Machine is an important entry in this genre of science fiction, a genre that seems to want to tell us something important about the future. Caity Lotz, so wonderful in the CW's television series Arrow, is also wonderful here.",1397001600,45,558,5.3522727272727275
6096963,4,B00GOVRVTM,"I was looking on Amazon for something to watch and came across The Machine.  It only had 3 reviews at the time, but I figured why not.  It wasn't like it'd be the first time I stopped watching a movie.

I'll tell you, I was really surprised.  This was a pretty good sci-fi flick.  I'm not much of a review writer - so I don't really know what to say other than I enjoyed it; I liked the premise, the plot, the acting, and all that happy stuff.  Why did I give it 4 stars and not 5?  Because I think it could have been fleshed out a little more.  Don't take that to mean it isn't worth watching though - because it is.

6096965,5,B00GOVRVTM,This is one of the best movies I have seen in the last few years. Similar in feel to Blade Runner yet still very original. The movie doesn't get caught up using CGI or ton of special effects yet when it does they serve the story. Very well done movie.,1397001600,67,251,4.04

6096968,5,B00GOVRVTM,This movie will end up a cult classic. A great story and wonderful acting bring you into a well told tale of man and machine.

6096976,4,B00GOVRVTM,"Great movie recommended for intelligent viewers who enjoy science & AI movies. The actress really did an amazing job in her dual roles. Very believable & enjoyable to watch.

The film would have benefitted with more background info & explanation of supporting characters. The lighting was too dark & the location was too dark & dank for an AI site which would normally be a spotless, clean white dust free lab. Especially a defense project. This is the fault of the director and his crew. There were some interesting, unique special effects.

The use of the word ""machine"" in the title & dialogue did not fit the film. Perhaps Android would be a better word. As well as cyborg. It reminds me of the Mona Lisa episode of the new Outer Limits. So it needed a softer, more descriptive title. I nearly passed up this jewel because the title made me think of some macho Van Diem war movie. If the title had implied AI, android or robot, I would have immediately grabbed it. However, I also agree that the war with China theme was 35 years out of date, inappropriate & off putting. In fact, it was not necessary to specify an enemy when developing weapons. Fortunately, it was only briefly mentioned in passing.

I also would have liked to have seen a longer ending & further developed story.

They clearly failed to market this film & give it a decent release. It is a British film. Possibly independent. A lot more could have been done to extend the story & the Ava robot role.

Still an enjoyable film & recommended except for those chronic whiners & complainers who are never satisfied.",1478649600,2,1584,4.58303886925795

6096978,4,B00GOVRVTM,I have an obsession with robotics so this type of movie is exciting and thought-provoking for me.  It will be interesting to see if we fuse our personalities with avatars or machines in the future.,1475193600,,197,4.628571428571429
6096979,5,B00GOVRVTM,"If this had been a Russian film made 30 years earlier- it would have been hailed as a masterpiece: well, actually, the good news is it is a masterpiece!

This is a highly intelligent and inventive movie and scripted to a dialogue that will sharpen our wits. The theme is Artificial Intelligence; androids; and a simmering, but distant threat of war between China and the West: we have a script for a very fine film.

The Machine is a movie that takes us into a sinister and violent journey into the unknown, but is grounded in life surviving thoughts of mortality,  leading to love and possibly compassion? It is very much a cult film belonging to British ownership, with an enjoyable sense of dark humour: A highly entertaining movie in a futuristic style of an early Russian masterpiece of film making?

The theme of the film will generate the horror of what is probably going to happen in anticipation of this story....and will ponder the question of the likely winners and losers of control....from war-torn and brain damaged soldiers to the experiments liken to Frankenstein and The Borg.....the soldiers of misfortune will try to engage in conversation, and those who do, will only speak in despair: they are imprisoned and treated like lab rats?

The scientists, Vincent and Ava will have no fear of adventure and discovery, but they may have agendas of their own fancy but Ava is different and a brilliant, new scientist she could potentially be more dangerous than the principle chief - a character that is wonderfully played in confidence and polished style by Denis Lawson........Vincent and Ava are charismatically played by Toby Stephens and Caity Lotz respectively  they remind me of Mulder and Scully ( from the X Files ) ....buzzing and engaging....

Most of the action takes place in an underground building  the lightening is top draw affects, and keeps us gazed constantly at the screen: the music ( or incidental music ) is genius to keep you attentive to the action with a sinister mood of anticipation. Outstanding in my opinion: I very much like this movie, and will watch again!",1475107200,,2102,4.851955307262569

6096982,5,B00GOVRVTM,"Finally, a good sci-fi movie without a load of crappy cgi!  I loved the actors as well.  Caity Lotz was amazing in both her roles, and the dystopian laboratory was very well done!  The musical score was perfect too.  It goes to show you that a great movie can be made without using crappy cgi that won't look good in a decade or so.  This movie has that elusive timeless quality like THX-1138 and will look just as good in 25 years.  Bravo!",1471305600,2,440,4.240963855421687

A UK film. Many may not understand the urgency and conflict of Thompson's interest in the android. The British Government's presence on the secret base was due to a crisis that had arisen where Mainland Chinese troops would likely take over the city of Taipei, Taiwan in a matter of days and that combat could occur at night where British soldiers would need to advance one city block, fight, and be fluent in the Chinese spoken language even if those soldiers are android.

6096998,5,B00GOVRVTM,"The film is a must see for those interested in robots, androids, and humans merging with machines or implants that take our senses to an incredible new level. Two artificial intelligence experts, one with an ailing daughter, come together to work on designing a sentient, thinking machine, a true A.I.
  Beautiful Caity Lotz plays both the role of one of the A.I. researchers and later the female android created by the Ministry of Defense. Two parts that are completely different. The latter character is a robot named, ""Machine"", who is made of metal and fiber optics with a gel-like/ plastic ""brain"", reminiscent of Ava's in Ex Machina,containing an artificial neural network system patterned after the human brain of Caity Lotz's assistant character which had been scanned to a certain degree prior to the assistant's accidental death. Machine somehow becomes sentient and although childlike as well as sympathetic, she is also a lethal, Military weapon.

As some other reviews here alluded to, The Machine is a bit like Ex-Machina, but on a tighter budget and with a bit more action and much less depth.  Toby Stephens is great, but I found Caity Lotz's character a bit predictable and typical.

6097032,4,B00GOVRVTM,"As 2015 moves into ""award"" season films, my favorite so far is ""Ex Machina"" which I've seen a couple times.  I thought it would be fun to take a look at this sci-fi flick from the U. K. by Caradog James who wrote and directed.  Both films deal with artificial intelligence and the resulting possibilities of a sentient being.

In this film, which takes place in the near future, the world is close to war again with the western allies tethered against China.  Both are trying to develop an artificial warrior to take drone strikes to a new level.  This plot has been played out many times in the past in film, so let's try to put it aside.  Nothing new there.

Leading the research for the Allies is Vincent McCarthy (Toby Stephens, TV's ""Black Sails""), who is not necessarily keen on the idea of warriors but does have an unlimited budget and access to an underground lab (shot in Wales).  He has an ulterior motive however.  His young daughter has a severe brain disease which he is hoping to cure.  Auditioning for a position with Vincent is a young American scientist, Ava (Caity Lotz, TV's ""Arrow"" and ""Mad Men"").  Of course there has to be a bad guy in all of this.  He as the head of the operation, will do whatever it takes to get the soldiers operational.

Thomson (Denis Lawson) in fact, manages to ""kill"" Ava as her inquisitiveness crosses certain boundaries.  She's reborn however thanks to Vincent's skills and becomes the most promising Machine in the works.  There are others who are still around but haven't lived up to expectations because of a loss of language.  Led by Suri (Pooneh Hajimohammadi) they speak in gibberish.

Given an obviously limited budget, Caradog cuts corners by dimly lighting the entire film.  So some of the intricate details are somewhat obscured.  I've never quite understood why somebody's office looks like it is lit by a 60 watt bulb and a dark shade.  In any case, the film is well acted and has some nice byplay between Ava/Machine and Vincent.  The early part of the film is mostly a set up and requires some patience.

The story owes a lot to previous films like ""Star Trek,"" ""I-Robot,"" ""Blade Runner"" and especially the silent classic ""Metropolis,"" where the actress plays both a human and a robotic creation.  While the film doesn't hold up to the brilliance of ""Ex Machina,"" it didn't have the budget either.  This is a fine example of a well-done ""B"" movie and worthy of a look.",1437782400,,2432,4.615384615384615

If you only watch the trailer, then go to bed & dream about it, it will be a far better experience than the actual movie! Look up synonyms for the words ""slow"", ""meandering"", ""forced"", ""artsy"", ""titillating"" --- you'll be more entertained. I would watch ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" again, before I would watch this a second time, (unless I went back to smoking pot, like I did 40 years ago when I watched THAT). Now I'm seriously thinking about NOT watching ""Ex Machina"", (I almost watched instead, but for the fact this was $3.00 cheaper).

like things went really fast paced, and what was going on, and the history of the tech..
I guess the environment, and the context were not elaborated enough. OF course you
could just watch and re-watch the movie and pick up and theorize about things, which
I guess could be enjoyable? but that's not really what I want to do.

6097088,4,B00GOVRVTM,"MY CALL:  Hardly an action movie at all, this clever sci-fi film is much more about the gracefully nave evolution of sentience in an artificial being.  And at that, it does a fantastic job!  You hardly notice the humble budget, which was handled very well.

During a Cold War with China in the future, a new kind of arms race begins to create artificial intelligence.  And like SkyNet (Terminator, T2), HAL (2001: A Space Odyssey), ARIIA (Eagle Eye), David (Prometheus) and VIKI (I, Robot) have taught us, this never tends to turn out well.  Kind of has me wondering about this Siri phone voice chick now.  Speaking of which, there is a lady Cyborg in this movie named Suri.

This film captured my interest right away.  In the first act of the story our lead scientist Vincent's (Toby Stephens; Black Sails, Robin Hood) approach to assessing a program's self-awareness and human-like cognizance involved thought exercises that are brilliantly simple, they make sense to us (the viewers), and we can tell when they're successful or not.  Adding conflict to the story, Vincent has a dying young girl with brain damage who lacks even the self-awareness of the programs he is assessing.  But great things can emerge from conflict.  And whereas this family-centric conflict finds little development through the course of the story, the film remains quite successful in its greater aims.

Vincent's place of employment is a research facility littered with early prototype cyborgs made from brain damaged ex-soldiers that have lost their capacity for oral speechand they all seem shady, untrustworthy and dangerous.  They also seem to house a mystery.

Vincent takes young scientist Ava (Caity Lotz; The Pact, Arrow) under his wing to develop next-gen artificial intelligence and she is much more sympathetic to their Cyborg subjects.  Ava is very curious, and that's not good in an industry loaded with secrets.

Long story short, Vincent makes a Cyborg with Ava's consciousness.  Cyborg Ava is smarter, more aware, and more compassionate than past prototypes and has an immediate attachment to Vincent.  But she is also nave, scared, easily manipulated, and modifiable.  Caity Lotz does an even finer job playing the enchantingly child-like Cyborg as she does the scientist.

When the action begins (towards the end), Caity Lotz convincingly moves with robotic precision in brilliant contrast to an elegant and tastefully shadowed nude dance scene humanizing her early in her development.  The action is nothing special, but it's every bit as good as it needs to be to keep our attention--with a few brutally cold, robotic, and entertaining moments.

Written and directed by someone (Caradog W. James; Little White Lies) of little experience in the sci-fi genre, I feel this film was extremely successful in concept execution, did a solid job of world-building (despite the limited sets and budget), a nice job in story development, and a perfect job in depicting Cyborg-Ava's mental development.

This is surely a must-see for any fan of Sci-Fi.  Just don't go in expecting laser guns and six-armed monsters.  This one is a bit more subtle.",1416614400,,3136,5.1

6097115,4,B00GOVRVTM,"The question of 'what constitutes human' has been explored in a number of movies. It's good fodder for sci-fi cinema and this is a decent entry into the genre.

Here's the scoop. An A.I. specialists accepts money from the Ministry of Defense in the hopes of helping his diseased daughter. A new, female A.I. specialist signs on to help the former create a self aware machine. She is murdered and the MoD will turn her into a new, nearly indestructible, fighting machine.

I liked this flick. The set-up is not an excuse to film a lot of action/violence. I also liked that there were a few good special effects used very strategically. They weren't overloaded for the ""Wow"" effect. This is shot well and well acted. Seeing Catie Lotz make the transformation from human to droid is really good. And she handles the hand to hand combat scenes with genuine authority.

This seems not to be a big budget film, but what money they had was used wisely. I never felt I was watching a cheap flick. It all worked well. The sets weren't huge and were lit in such a way as to hide the bones. Lotz's glowing eyes effect was cool and creepy at the same time, but obviously not that expensive. This is just a well realized, efficient film.

6097134,4,B00GOVRVTM,"How much of a person's brain can be replaced with technology before they are no longer human? If a machine can learn and grow, is it only a machine?

With medical and computer technology reaching forward into sci-fi territory, these are actual questions that we may one day have to ask ourselves. And they are are some of the questions that pop up in ""The Machine."" While the main plot is one that has been done before, it's handled with a kind of brutal delicacy, some strong direction and powerful acting by Toby Stephens and Caity Lotz.

In the not-too-distant-future (next Sunday A.D.), Britain is embroiled in a cold war with China. Scientist Vincent McCarthy (Toby Stephens) is in charge of giving cybernetic implants to brain-damaged soldiers; while they seem to become mute soon after, they regain all their physical and mental faculties. He hopes that he can use this technology on his daughter, who suffers from a debilitating neurological disorder.

Then he meets Ava (Caity Lotz), a brilliant young scientist who has created an A.I. which is almost human. With her help, Vincent begins work on a sentient android by scanning her brain into a quantum computer... and after she's unexpectedly murdered, Vincent uses her likeness and brain scan for The Machine (also played by Caity Lotz), a gynoid who is almost indistinguishable from a human.

In fact, she's a little TOO human -- she feels emotions like fear, love and remorse, and has a sense of morality that Vincent encourages. She also is capable of communicating with the cyborgs. Since the sleazy government/corporate boss Thomson (Denis Lawson) wants a mindless killing machine, he's not too pleased by this. So he demands that Vincent lobotomize away Machine's humanity.

The plot of ""The Machine"" is one we've seen before -- someone builds a robot who turns out to be more human than expected -- but Caradog W. James does an excellent job without being too preachy. It certainly helps that he includes some very realistic aspects to the story, such as conflicts with China and medical advances that are actually plausible (such as prosthetic limbs connected to the nervous system).

And James uses that bedrock to build a very simple yet emotionally complicated story, which slinks along in moody, tense scenes that click together by the end. The movie is rather slow at times, focusing mostly on Vincent discovering how human Machine is while Thomson tries to corrupt her. After so many quiet scenes, the gruesome and chaotic climax comes as a bit of a shock.

The movie was made for less than a million pounds, and at times it shows -- almost the entire story takes place in a military base, with some generic hallways and a big leaky airline hangar. However, the special effects are beautifully done, and James cloaks the bleak sets in shadows and bright lights, puddles of glimmering water and red, foggy alert lights.

This is also a movie that heavily relies on its actors, and both Stephens and Lotz are absolutely sublime here. Stephens plays Vincent as a prickly, worn-out man whose only enthusiasm seems to be for saving his daughter, until he encounters the pure humanity of Machine.  Lotz is also quite excellent -- she plays Machine with a wide-eyed, childlike wonder at the world, which she maintains even after coming face-to-face with its horrors (""I just have to make you dead inside, like you tried to make me"").

There's also a good supporting role for Pooneh Hajimohammadi, who gives an effectively silent performance as the leader of the cyborgs. And Lawson also deserves some praise for being a very plausibly despicable villain -- like the real-life military, he doesn't care about wounded veterans or innocent people. He just wants obedient super-soldiers and new ways to kill. It's all too realistic.

While the concept is not new, ""The Machine"" is a slow, powerful little sci-fi movie that sets itself in a chillingly plausible future world. If nothing else, watch it for Stephens and Lotz's excellent performances.",1410393600,,4012,4.946508172362556

6097140,5,B00GOVRVTM,"The Machine, despite it's unoriginal title, is a really good movie! It can be a little dull or boring sometimes and the pacing is a little slow, but the plot and storytelling is really good! Similar to ""Robocop,"" an ambitious bright expert in their field is killed by criminals and her body is used to serve as the catalyst for her lifelong project, a sentient A.I. codenamed ""Ava"" (Caity Lotz). A leading expert on artificial intelligence technology (Toby Stephens) helps to make the childlike cyborg Ava understand what it means to be human and value life. Only there's a problem. The ones funding Vincent's project to help create Ava are a shady military organization that wants to use Ava as a literal supersoldier. And with superhuman strength, durability and reflexes, Ava is their ideal killing machine. Will Ava learn to value life and humanity  and break free of her initial programming to kill all enemy soldiers?

The movie is well directed as CGI is very limited here and most of it is just really good makeup, standard effects, and props. Caity Lotz comes off as a veteran actress here and both has the looks and acting ability to play a role like this, as well as any ""superheroine or female bad-ass with a heart of gold"" role. (She also plays Black Canary on The CW's ""Arrow."") Lotz is also in *insanely* good shape! One might mistake her for an Olympic-athlete-turned-actress.  The pacing works and the relationship between the innocent and childlike Ava and her mentor/father figure Vincent works well. As a TV Movie (in some markets) and Direct-to-DVD movie (in other markets), this film was seriously underrated. If you like sci-fi that feels more realistic and adds more human depth to it, you'll enjoy The Machine.",1409961600,,1735,4.85472972972973

6097151,2,B00GOVRVTM,"Good style over substance that devolves into shlock. It starts off promising and the two lead actors are excellent and make this film watchable, even during it's cringeworthy moments. Any comparison to Bladerunner is purely superficial with the 80s type soundtrack and dark, bleak visuals.

While the movie begins with some promise about an experiment gone wrong, it's apparent rather early that the story is told in disjointed fashion and the science quickly devolves into total shlock scifi cliche. There is a connection between the doctor's sick daughter and his new assistant but the connection is not made clear, neither scientifically nor emotionally. ""Cool concepts"" are introduced that make you think that there is more going on, which there is, including the presence of your typical cardboard villain. There are many gaping plot holes and things that make you go ""huh?"" (such as why greater care wouldn't have been taken with machines... which is answered by the fact that the plot couldn't have moved in the direction it did if the script made too much sense.)

Unfortunately the middle and ending are predictable and rather silly. Caity Lotz does a phenomenal job to pull off a believable android and Toby Stephens does a great job as the lead actor. But the script makes him a 2 dimensional character and all of the characters in this film are pure cardboard. There is no reason to care about them. What made Bladerunner such a great film is where this one fails by a very large margin. Someone could have helped with the choppy editing and a second and third pair of eyes to create a more plausible script with a meaningful message rather than what we've all seen before numerous times just done with a little more visual style.

Watchable but if you're expecting Bladerunner or even decent scifi, you'll probably be disappointed.",1408579200,,1844,4.922829581993569

6097161,3,B00GOVRVTM,"This sci-fi film is set in a future of somewhat questionable believability for me, which included a prolonged world recession and prolonged new ""cold war"" between China (and allies, I assume) and Western powers.  Having been produced in Great Britain [one of the producers is the ""Welsh Assembly Government""] the ""bad guys"" here are the British Ministry of Defense which would like to develop androids good enough to pass as human, infiltrate enemy command and control areas and kill the leaders.  The ""good guy"" is an artificial-intelligence researcher Vincent McCarthy, who has more personal motivations: his dream is to be able to transfer the memories and personality of a living person into an electronic brain, as a way of saving his own child, who otherwise is doomed by Rett's Syndrome.

So there's the set-up to the plot, which of course involves androids with intelligence [some kind of co-mingling of human and artificial] and whether they will turn against their creators or not.  On the spectrum of fears and hopes, this film is substantially darker in tone than ""Her"", but not nearly as grim as, for example, ""Terminator"".  I didn't feel it broke very much new ground.  One of the lesser actresses, playing one of a bunch of brain-damaged fighters who were salvaged by the addition of artificial intelligence, somehow stood out for me as more interesting than any of the ones who took up most of the screen time.

6097179,4,B00GOVRVTM,"Wow. I had never heard of this film, randomly came across it, and decided to give it a chance based on some positive reviews. This is one of the best science fiction films that I have seen lately. The premise mines the endlessly fascinating subject of artificial intelligence, and does so with nuance, even considering the fairly quick pace of the story. Very tight construction overall.

The main thing that I would say is that The Machine is exceptionally well directed. It is a work of both technical skill and artistic instinct. This is not the sort of cheap sci-fi that you may be wondering if it is, if you are anything like me. It may not be a huge, behemoth of a film, but it incorporates some very cool, perfectly utilized visual effects, and the shot composition is fantastic. Perfect visual choices for the material. The writing and acting are solid, and in the case of the lead actress of course, notably good.

There are certainly traces of Blade Runner, A.I., Her and other films, but this one stands on its own just fine. It is serious, thoughtful science fiction. Not perfect, but critiquing the occasional scientific implausibility is really missing the point, here. This is not a documentary, but rather a fictional drama. That being said, it is in my opinion and impeccably well-made film and one of the best examples of recent film-making in this genre.

The box design makes the film look like a terminator film but it's way better than the last few Terminator films and could easily replace Rise of the Machines as a birth of AI film.  This film was more about the creation of complex AI and what to do with it and less of an action film.  There is action in it but that is not what drives the film.  My one problem with the film, is that it was shot to dark but I wish that every film I saw had a problem that minor.  Many of the scenes use expression and movement to convey things like in Blade Runner.  I loved this film and will be buying it, This review is based on the four days I had to rent the blu ray. Spoiler, The ending has you wondering if the advanced AI need humanity or not.  You can either believe on or the other.  I want to believe that ""the Machine"" is crying out of happiness that the AI daughter loves her ant that she has a family buy she could just as easily be crying at knowing that her human husband will be a thing of the past.

Otherwise it's a story that's been told many times before - minus the hundred machine guns - find the second Outer Limits series from the 80's and watch ""Valerie 23"" from the first season, a vastly superior piece of work, as is its sequel ""Mary 25"" in season four.

But back to this pile of rubbish - rubbish writing being the prime culprit. As soon as we're taken by the emotional evolution of the main character the film instantly devolves into a typically sophomoric shoot-em-up. A thousand bullets pierce flesh, the dead bodies pile up, the rivers of blood flow. Idiotic, almost insulting to the viewer's intelligence.

If they had left out the guns and the cookie-cutter bad guy boss, and cut it down to the relationship between the machine and her creator, this could have been a brilliant film. But no, that would have required some intelligence, which this film entirely lacks. What a waste of talent. And, except for Ms. Lotz's performance, one's time.",1403654400,,1193,4.896039603960396

6097229,4,B00GOVRVTM,"Very few movies try to help us envision how machines or cybernetic organisms become sentient beings, though there are plenty that show apocalyptic visions of how things go wrong afterward. Often the method of this process is not that interesting to many just looking for a good action flick, which is why you see some mixed reviews for this movie. I myself almost turned the movie off during the first five minutes.  I am so glad I stuck with it. It still has action if you wait for it. But let me make the case for why else you should give this movie a chance.

This evolution or bestowal of consciousness is where modest budget THE MACHINE excels. Of course you still have to suspend disbelief a little. Here we have wounded soldiers from a near future war being used as guinea pigs for interface with cybernetic implants or replacement parts of the body, including areas of the brain. That's just a springboard as they begin to create the cybernetic organism from scratch.  Ethical issues are also tackled as broken solders are used and discarded.

Vincent is a driven artificial intelligence engineer obsessed with his work because of his dying daughter. He wishes to map human consciousness and transfer his daughter's own into another being he will create. He is forced to make a deal with the devil, so to speak, as he accepts funding from a powerful entity from the Ministry of Defense (MOD).  But the real desire of the MOD is to use Vincent's research to create the ultimate warrior. Vincent hires a young prodigy in the AI field (played by Caity Lotz) who has just made a breakthrough in creating true artificial intelligence. Vincent begins combining both of their work and even maps his assistant's brain and body as the first test case.  Secretly, he is mapping his daughter as well. They soon ""give birth"" of a type to a sentient cybernetic organism with both the physical features and some intellect of his assistant. On a subconscious level, the being has also been programmed with martial skills that Vincent is not aware of. This new being is her own person, despite having the assistant's brain map transfer. Caity Lotz plays both characters and shows a surprising depth as she gives life to the new being with child like vulnerability, the awkwardness of a machine, and the hardness of a weapon. At the same time, she is completely believable and charming as the witty, intelligent scientist. She is so stunning!  Her dance background and amazing physique effectively humanize the machine as she discovers art and beauty in the form of music and dance. That sounds cheesy, but I can tell you she had my attention. Vincent happens upon her, and watches in awe, as she dances despite never being taught. It's a surprisingly beautiful scene and there's some chemistry going on.  However, the machine's true applications become apparent as she matures and understands her environment.  Conflicts develop between Vincent and the MOD and you know things have to go wrong.  That's where the action comes in. Can this machine feel affection or instinctively know right from wrong?  Can Vincent save his daughter before conflict erupts?

You will see other reviews specifically mention Blade Runner as a connection or inspiration. In truth, it's mainly the music that is sometimes reminiscent of that movie. This production is really not like Blade Runner. However, if someone said - write a prequel to show how a Blade Runner type world could eventually happen - this is a plausible genesis. Just don't expect this movie to resemble that one much in any way. The CGI use and special effects are very modestly applied. When they are, it's subtle but very cool in my opinion. I really liked the way they made her skin slightly luminesce when the machine is processing information or changing a mood. It was just beautiful and clever while maintaining the feeling we are still dealing with a machine.

3/4ths of this movie is spent showing the development of the new being. If you are interested in the process and willing to wait for the action, it will be a very rewarding experience. For those not interested in dragging out the how or why, it may not hold your interest. I suggest getting through the first 15-30 min before passing judgment.",1402012800,65,4255,4.80437756497948

The content is enough for a 45-50 minute show, but the runtime is 95 minutes.

Some of the filler is watching Caity Lotz in translucent latex or form fitting clothes.  Nice for a few minutes, but get on with it!

Literally too.  They can afford to power petaflops of processing, but not a few LED lights?

Some of the cinematography and score are reminiscent of 1980s era SciFi like Blade Runner, etc.

6097236,3,B00GOVRVTM,"THE MACHINE is competently made, occasionally deep but slightly underwhelming sci-fi film. The story is about a government employee who works with robotics. His daughter is sick, and he hopes to find a cure for her through his work. Shortly after taking on a new assistant, Ava, she is killed and he puts her consciousness into a machine that has her likeness. One thing I did like about the movie was that it took its time with character development and raised those interesting questions that many other sci-films only flirt with: the question of whether AI can ever be considered ""alive"", what it means to be human, etc. Character motivations were also explored to a degree, which helped to flesh out the material despite the short running time. The only fault I can find with it is that there wasn't enough payoff in terms of action or suspense. The movie was definitely building up to something (which I won't spoil), but the way in which it was resolved was kind of messy and could have been handled in a better way. Still, I did enjoy it. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning. There were elements of it that reminded me of BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Overall, this is more of a thinking person's sci-fi, which isn't bad, it's just not what I expected.",1401321600,4,1285,4.640350877192983

6097240,5,B00GOVRVTM,"If you are fan of  cyber punk novels William Gibson etc. you will like this. the only  flaw is perhaps its a bit low budget. There are so many movies like this that are unwatchable, i was hesitant to bother giving it a try. I just have to say its really cool even down to the 1980s, ""they live"" type music.  I can understand some people not saying its good based on the non-blockbuster budget treatment this film received.  I'm sure some of those people just loved transformers 2 and 3. Sure those films look good but basically they have no story, just travel around the world to new locales.  Its like robot filled travel guide(now lets go see the Egyptian pyramids etc.)  But the machine goes nowhere and has minimal CGI on screen, but does actually have a cool story. The pacing is pretty good and seems to keep your interest up.  Like I said cyber punk has been done many times in films, but rarely  has someone pulled off something like this. While a film like Blade Runner is a classic, and has some amazing moments it does seem to drag at times.  And the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" seems much more fleshed out as is ""the machine."" Even though it would count more as short story.  and even if they did remake the  ""the machine"" as a big budget film just as likley the new producers would  screw it up rather than improve it,",1401235200,3,1347,4.344

This sci-fi story was not one of those movies. It tackled a classic sci-fi topic of the possibility of a man-made robot/machine becoming a self-aware sentient being, and the questionable morality of humans that comes with it: The ""Ghost in the machine"" if you will. The character development was great and you actually care about the characters, go figure! Something lost in much of the flash, glitter, explosions, and obscenely unrealistic action sequences in many movies of today. Don't get me wrong, I love a great thrill too. But the special effects in this movie were quite good and used as part of the story, not to compensate for something otherwise boring. Basically, it is definitely a great pick for sci-fi fans!

This is an old theme dealt with in classics ranging from the I robot series by Issac Asimov, the ""Terminator films"", Blade runner and so forth. The basic plot in this film surrounds a computer scientist is developing AI while working at a somewhat creepy appearing military installation run by the British government during a vague conflict with China. The ostensible goal of the project is to find ways to aid brain injured soldiers. The doctor is aware of potentially more sinister aspirations of the government but ignores this because he believes his work is the only way to save his daughter who is dying from a degenerative brain disease, ( Rett's syndrome). Eventually he succeeds in developing a fully functioning android that apparently is self aware. Like most sci-fi androids the machine is faster, stronger and much harder to injure than a flesh and blood human. The plot thickens as the governments plans for the ""Machine"" run up against the scientists plans and the ""machines"" own proto-humanity. The movie gets points for effectively spooky atmospherics, and conceptually interesting ( if not particularly novel) plot. Like most science fiction movies looses points for almost complete lack of connection with anything like real science. That is the movie throws out terms like quantum computing, etc.. and without any real appreciation of what that means. Although this is a sin of most sci-fi flicks there are exceptions who do a better job of avoiding this, think Robert Wises adaptation of Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain. Anyway not a bad way to while away the time if not much to do on a rainy Saturday, but overall mediocre at best.",1400716800,,1837,5.026229508196721
6097257,2,B00GOVRVTM,For a low)er) budget sci-fi movie it wasn't half bad. Although the plot could have been better and it fell short a couple of times. The special effects were pretty good. Not bad for a first time director,1400716800,,203,4.368421052631579
6097258,3,B00GOVRVTM,"I want to give this 3.5, but I can't give it a 4 in absence of that option.

Premise of the movie is decent if entirely predictable (really nothing new to the table here at all). Acting is good, the actor who plays the main scientist and the actress who plays the android both do solid jobs.

Here are the main problems with the movie:

- Music is a CATASTROPHE. It sounds like something out of a 70's movie. I know that's what they were going for, but taking music from Blade Runner or some low-budget 70's sci-fi movie doesn't give this an air of nostalgia; on the contrary it's almost like the soundtrack is mocking the movie. Normally a bad musical score I'd just ignore, but this one truly detracted from the movie

- The head guy who leads the labs quickly shows his cards as being a nasty guy. He was so thoroughly one-dimensional as to not be believable. His part was hastily and lazily created

- Implanted humans who've lost the ability to speak talk in a frankly very uncomfortable manner. I didn't enjoy their screen time on a visceral level

I wish I could 4-star this, but the music compels me to prohibit such a grade. The movie is worth a rental, I suppose, but we've seen much better movies about AI in the past.",1400716800,,1229,4.344978165938865

Known for taking their time to develop plot and relationships through a lot of talking, the English often do a fine job with period pieces. However, this is not a period piece, and well, it really started to drag about 20 mins into the story -- and then it just kept dragging.

Kind of a Terminator meets Robocop meets the darkness in Alien  ...but not as big budget as those movies and definitely not as layered as those movies. The female actress in The Machine was really good in machine mode and all the actors did pretty well....but that is all that should be given notice. ok...the graphics were semi-decent too. But I wish it was worth my $3.99 rental fee. It is not a movie you would wonder about. Not a complexly layered movie. Just kind of superficial in its delivery. The dialogue is decent...more real....which keeps to the act of being human vs. being machine. Just wish it had more to give. If it was the beginning of a book series or something...maybe then it would stand a chance...but who knows. ...but I don't need another Resident Evil either.,1399939200,6,887,4.72258064516129

Loved this rental so much I immediately pre-ordered the upcoming blu-ray release and bought the soundtrack. It was a great throwback to a type of dystopian, fear-of-robots style of science fiction I loved so much in the 80s and early 90s, but had a great deal of sophistication that raised it above its ""b-movie"" roots. Caity Lotz was completely captivating in her roles, and it was great to see Denis Lawson chew up his role. It's amazing that a film like this can do so much with such a relatively small budget, and be *so* much more satisfying on an emotional level than similar material (Terminator Salvation comes to mind).",1399852800,14,752,4.704545454545454

I've been on a mad-scientist film kick recently and I just watched this and Splice. What a difference between the two films! This one I recommend.

The Machine has the typical ""can science go to far theme"". There is also a dash of military.

What I love about it is the lead, Caity Lotz. She's on fire! I normally don't like many modern actresses because their parts are so flat. Not with Caity. She actually plays two roles and she's believable in either. The roles are well constructed so kudos to the scriptwriter!

The special effects are beautiful. Yes, there is nudity, but it's tastefully done. Please note I'm writing this in the same paragraph as special effects. The creation of the Machine is unique. Kudos again to the technical director and the special effects team.

The locations for this film are simple. But that simplicity does not take away from the story. The actors bring you into it.

This film reminds me somewhat of the Terminator, but I cannot say it'll be exactly the same. While both have action, the Machine has much more drama and depth.

The only reason it's 4.5 stars and not 5 is because I was not able to understand Cyborg speech. It wasn't automatically subtitled. I do not know if it was intended as a creative design. That is a very small complaint.

Unlike Blade Runner, this is not the kind of movie I would watch repeatedly, even if the story was considered good.  It still lacks the mystic and the real world feel of the era in which Blade Runner was portrayed.  For example.  It is always dark, like in Blade Runner, but there is no city walk, no people, only a base which made this a budgetary type decision, but it takes away the rest of the world and culture and nuance you find Blade Runner.

The troops don't seem to mind and play along as the head villian puts Ava through her paces far longer than is needed to prove she is quite capable of ripping them all limb from limb and is impervious to all weapons.  Yet her heart is pure and she trusts the male lead implicitly even though ever time he dumps her to rush to his ailing daughter more death games happen in his absence.

At a little over 90 minutes, it drags along with wonky CGI, risible dialog and non-existent character development. I felt bad for the actors having to do their best to make anything of this.

Every possible cliche is jammed into the plot, from the scientist ""I'm only doing this to save my daughter"" routine to the innocent child-like robot being forced to do bad things and then ""falling in love"", to the cringe-worthy ""This is her consciousness, her soul!"" line - and let's not forget the demented lady looking for answers about her son. Add in a generous mix of evil government characters doing evilly, governmentally things and it's the sort of rehashed crap that even TV shows wouldn't dare try out these days.

There's some artsy cinematography that tries to disguise that it was clearly shot in a parking lot but the production standards really don't hold up. The lighting is bad and the 80s synth soundtrack is dreadful (Vangelis it ain't). There are some murmurings comparing this to a Blade Runner prequel but that's just an insult to a classic that doesn't even warrant considering.

Having a story and developing character is not the same as a balls to the wall action flick.  If you can't stand a story and just wanna see boobs, guns, and gore don't rent this movie.  Although there is some tasteful nudity it's not gratuitous and just illustrates the grace and form of a robot made in a feminine form.  Also there is a bit of action but this movie is more about the complexities of creating an AI.  I found it intelligent and well acted.  If you like Science fiction at all I would rent this movie.

But I hate movies that make me scream ""turn the damn lights on"" because, you know, why would a research facility need romantic ambient lighting for every scene that wasn't outside at night in the rain.  Well the better to see the glowing eyes of living machines I suppose. The script was fairly tight and a lot of interesting scenes that unfortunately just seemed to be excuses to let bullets fly.  And it was riddled with clichs - the scientist who is trying to save his dying daughter, sort of, the wide eyed enthusiastic all too curious new girl scientist who is sacrificed to create the subject of the film, the Machine, and who, by the way, loses her serious voice once she becomes a machine and suddenly sounds like a kitten.  And the robots chattering in private amongst themselves while hapless humans struggle through their lives.  You know it won't end well for any of the humans.  But there was one real problem that was never explained and would have made a nicer ending.  In the opening scenes  it appears our protagonist scientist dies.  Then as the action progresses we seem him working on his project.  I kept waiting for the aha moment when he finds out he's a machine but is he?  Who knows ? That kind of went nowhere.

The gore and violence was not excessive but may be a little gruesome for some.  The plot was not very creative but they stuck to the point.  There was not a dull moment in the film for me.  The only reason that I gave it four stars was because I really wanted more for the machine herself.  She (or it) showed such genuine curiosity that I found myself wanting her (or it) to experience more, as odd as that sounds.  I guess I'm saying that I really connected with the characters.

However, the soundtrack was incredibly stagnant and as bad as one can imagine in low-budget movies. Personally, I believe the soundtrack sets the backdrop and should work with a movie, not against it.  Some more creativity should and could have been developed in this area. This is why I give it three stars.  The only good part was when they used classical music for a certain part of the movie. With the synthesizers being advanced the way they are today, its very tempting to use ""one button"" compositions with prefab sounds and rhythms.

It took an idea (intelligent machines) and extrapolated the idea into an awesome story. You will enjoy the plot twists as the machine struggles with the good and bad of humanity.

You will leave off thinking on matters deeper than merely entertainment.

6097347,4,B00GOVRVTM,"It's a shame this story was [not quite] wasted on such a lackluster screenplay. This just-under-Hollywood-caliber movie is slow at times, occasionally spending too much time in certain scenes, some seeming unnecessary altogether. The importance of some characters (like Suri) and plot points (like everything that Suri does) are initially overstated, only later to end up under-utilized, to the point that the story might not have even needed them at all.

Watch this movie, because ultimately it does turn out to be a decent, 4-star Sci-fi/Action flick, with really good performances from Lotz (who actually looks better here than she does on The Arrow, if you can believe that), Stephens, and Hazeldine (who is just as creepy here as he is on Resurrection).

6097348,4,B00GOVRVTM,"This is by no means a new story, but The Machine is surprisingly delightful for a movie about a killer robot. There are some outstanding performances as the characters transform through the story. The intelligence tests are witty and fun. The birth, and growth of the main character is superb, well acted and easily draws out an emotional response from the viewer.

Some of the standard material that are arguably needed for a story line were the military backdrop and the villain. Though I wouldnt say they were poorly acted, there was just nothing new to be seen from them. As an American viewer, I found the main villain to be overly British and thus obvious, having more to do with an evil school master than the head of a military research organization; but that could be just my failings as an American.

My only gripe with the movie is the length! In the age of the three hour movie, this movie being only one hour and 30 min left me wanting for more! Perhaps just a peek at the future to come, a hint of robot assassins in China with scenes of elegant baileigh, sharp metal and blood; it is Science Fiction in the end.",1398124800,2,1126,4.461165048543689

The special effects are simple, adequate and, for the most part, fairly well done when compared to your average B flick. The acting itself is good enough, no stellar performances ... the two main actors basically do an adequate job keeping this film from being a cheesy low rate B movie.
The story line itself is somewhat intriguing. While not totally original (this is like a cheaper version of I Robot or Bladerunner), there are better movies that explore the world of artificial intelligence.

6097360,5,B00GOVRVTM,"I just finished watching this movie and was greatly impressed considering the low budget and lack of major actors. Others have written about the story and I won't rehash much except to say that it's only major fault is that it has the same problem many movies I lump in this genre,such as Sunshine and Pandorum, have. Which is after having 3/4ths of the movie being fairly contemplative the final act is a fairly unimaginative action shootout. It's not a badly done one really, but I would have probably appreciated if it had remained a little more consistent.

The acting is actually great throughout and very convincing, Caity Loitz in particular does a great job of portraying the android as it progresses from simple naivety to ruthless killer and finally to a mother figure. If she hadn't pulled that off so well the movie wouldn't have worked nearly as well as it did. That being said, between the neon blue glowing eyes and body that has red backlighting like an Alienware computer she looks like something out of Tron Legacy much of the time (not in a bad way at all though).

What I really enjoyed most about the movie was how it had an even-handed approach to a number of science fiction topics that are normally covered in a very dystopian and negative light in other movies (after all the titular Machine of the movie is essentially the Terminatrix from Terminator 3). Namely computer augmentation of the brain, cybernetic prostheses, and artificial intelligence. In fact for a change from most science fiction which concludes with the machines being destroyed and the implication that humans should actively avoid trying to ever create artificial life (*cough* Battlestar Galactica *cough*), The Machine instead leaves with a subtle message that artificial life will essentially be humanities children and it may be natural that they eventually succeed us or redefine us.

It's been said before as well, this movie has a lot in common theme-wise with Blade Runner, which is true. What's interesting though is that like many science fiction movies nowadays the concepts covered are far closer to home now, and the setting of the movie seems close around the corner within a decade or two, and not some distant horizon.

All in all, fantastic movie, and if you liked Blade Runner, Dark City, Cube, or Pandorum i'm sure you'd like this movie as well.",1397779200,3,2360,4.86318407960199

6097365,4,B00GOVRVTM,"My guess is that if you like the trailer, then you'll probably like the movie.

I got more out of it than I expected/feared from reading some of the lower rated reviews; and felt it was well done for a budget film.  So was worth the basic cost of an amazon rental on this at-home movie day afternoon to distract me from the inevitable mindlessness of  busywork/chores at hand.

The movie did have some bloody/bone breaking/killing spree type scenes that you could see coming.  So if you're sensitive, you may need to trust that they will come as expected, and then be prepared to look away during those bits...I did, and so none of them really caught me by surprise so much that they made me queasy.  However, had I chosen to watch all the fighting scenes, then the movie probably would have felt too unnecessarily violent for me - but I realize that's a matter of personal taste, and so this comment is mostly a heads up for those of us who are more sensitive about violence, but still like this type of story.

While the movie ending was somewhat anticipated, it also contained enough of a twist to make me think more deeply about what the writers were saying about the future of humanity, machines, and the their inter-relationships - which mimics the strengths/weaknesses of human creators.  Some of this has been said before, and will be repeated again, but I enjoy this type of story.  So, as long as the story and cinematography are relatively well done (and they avoid problematic gore & gratuitous sex/nudity, etc. that just serve to take away from the story and push it too far to make it enjoyable), then I'm game to watch these kinds of stories again and again to see what kind of fresh elements they'll try to insert in the subject next time around.",1397606400,2,1762,4.550632911392405
6097366,2,B00GOVRVTM,"Looking back after renting this movie I would not do it again if I had it
to do over again, it was bad and pointless.  Just one of these shows that
portray an evil military program trying to make killer robot soldiers, so of
course they make the ""machine"" a good looking woman! LOL.

Cold, dark and sterile, the story was like the military installation, and you
wonder how the two, or three protagonists ever got there or worked there.
Experimenting with people, and wounded soldiers was also just in bad
taste and gruesome, but not in a way that furthered the plot or made a
point.

While it was not unwatchable, i.e. 1/5, it was not OK or entertaining, i.e. 3/5,
so that leaves 2/5, I did not like it.  This belongs on NetFlix for free.",1397606400,,738,4.364963503649635
6097367,4,B00GOVRVTM,"In the near future China and the west get into a cold war, one where China kicks butt. The background material is almost insignificant. This story concerns the creation of machine implants in humans as well as the artificial intelligence question, similar to the ones asked in ""I, Robot."" Vincent ( Toby Stephens) works with new hirer Ava (Caity Lotz) to create...whatever it is the military wants. Vincent also has issues with his special needs daughter and seeks help for her.

The film is imaginatively done in a limited setting. The plot breaks with much of the formulaic trash that make up block busters, but not totally. Good red and black film for science fiction and conspiracy fans.

6097371,4,B00GOVRVTM,"I decided to watch the movie as the lead actress is from a tv show I watched. The trailer was pretty cool.

Its a drama with some combat. I liked it much better than Gravity which disappointed me. The special effects are pretty decent. I think much of the ""dark"" scenes are for effect and perhaps to not kill the budget on special effects. The plot, dialogue and acting were better than some major productions I've seen.

If you're into action movies with sex, sexuality, nudity, graphic violence, etc., this is not the movie for you. But if you watched Riddick and were angry by the end for lack of originality, bad dialogue, use of sexuality to replace a good plot/effort, this may work for you.",1397433600,,697,4.523809523809524
6097372,3,B00GOVRVTM,"Not sure how to critique this since the movie's direction and subject really did appeal to me but I felt it should have been made during the 80s instead of now. Before watching it I had assumed it was going to be a low budget B movie you might find on the sci-fi channel or Netflix but surprisingly it was a little bit better than that. However it's not perfect and I can understand if someone doesn't like it or felt it was just a one-timer.

Movies it resembles:
Ghost in the Shell (1995), Terminator 3 (2003), Universal Soldier (1992), Robocop (2014), Battlestar Galactica (2004), i-Robot (2004)

What it needed:
Ending - Endings are important because it gives you the last impression so it can hurt the film if not done correctly. The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly and after little to no important dialogue and looking off into the sunset the credits begin to roll. So you're like, that's it?

Budget - It needed a bigger budget. The reason for this is because some of the scenes, backgrounds, and locations are not that interesting. They could expanded their creativity by putting more thought and artistic work into these things. The robot is wonderful to look at but you mostly see modern rooms, lab hallways, and typical settings.

Camera - You can always tell a quality of the film by the type of camera they used. They could have used a higher budgeted movie camera that you expect for cinema released films. It looks like a movie made for television or sci-fi channel. There are a lot of dark rooms and shadows instead of brightly lit rooms for details. Some dark scenes were I guess necessary to hide the machine's naked body.

Characters & Acting - There are no big names or unforgettable faces except one and that is the actress for The Machine. The others character's moods and personalities are not likable, therefore you don't care if anyone gets killed off. The Acting is not terrible but not great. The Machine is more machine like and less ""some pretty actress trying to be machine"" than I expected. She did a somewhat satisfying job in creating a robot's personality.

Action - in an action movie about a fighting machine you would expect a lot battle scenes and high suspense moments but there are not very many and they are pretty short. I wanted more of that but whatever.

Story - A computer programmer who I forget his name is trying to create advanced artificial intelligence. He hires a woman (Ava) who has successfully done so. But the corrupt, (I think it was the british government?) or weapon research facility they work for want to use the robot to infiltrate enemy territories and assassinate key members in the war. We never see that happen because the robot has a conscience to save her programmer (who is trying to save his daughter) and put an end to the corruption. Overall it was just okay because it could have used some more work. I can't recommend it since it lacks in the areas mentioned above but if you're into science fiction, ai robot movies, and bored I recommend giving it a try.

6097374,4,B00GOVRVTM,"Some of the scenes are shot in very, very low light. Opt for the HD version if you can. A great film betrayed by its own rush to conclusion. (Spoiler, don't read further...) We can understand her skin is impervious to bullets, but in the last scenes where she is relentlessly struck by a dozen automatic rifles, at the very least, her clothing should have been torn to shreds. It's these types of flubs which stretch credibility and undermine suspension of disbelief. Caity Lotz and Toby Stephens's performances are both brilliant.

8625726,4,B00GOVRVTM,"This film was good, with a bit of bad, and happily no real ugly. 'The Machine' was an entertaining film overall with many beautiful and lyrical moments. There were some interesting ideas considered in the flick, such as AI being the future of humanity, an AI response to beauty, and an exploration of the definition and development of consciousness. Other good things were some of the wonderful sci-fi imagery in techonology, including a video wallet photo, and more. I like the bizarre language of the AI/former soldiers (although, like many of the film elements, that was under-utilized as an aspect of the story), loved the shades of Bladrunner, and the overall story. The bad is that there is an overly long set-up, parts of the beginning of the film felt discordant, as moments felt fragmented, and unconnected to the over-arching plot. Also, some of the dialogue was very on-the-nose and delivered in the wrong scenes, to the wrong character, with the wrong tone, thereby losing the potential to improve the story. So often the impact of scenes were lost due to such seemingly minor creative choices. Speaking of plot, by far the worst issue with this sci-fi action film (my fave genre) is that it wanders (unlike BL). The movie has no apparent over-arching plot, or very much at stake, or the scenes where we would see what was at stake were not written/filmed. So, the high-impact visuals and violence are far less impactful. With no ticking clock, and no character revelationto emphasize any stakes, with no obvious goals for anyone, organization or individual, the film was less satisfying then it might have been. Plotting is a decided art, and a writer/director does have time for creating magical ambiance and setting that related tone, but for the story to work the plot must be good. This story did not have rising action or rising tensio for me. Still, this is a writer/director to watch and this movie was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. You may lobe the tory even more, so happy viewing~*",1496102400,,2017,4.815561959654179
