2517311,4,B000EDWLXC,"I have seen all the episodes on this DVD after having been subbed by fans.  First of all it is incredibly beautiful and the action is great.  If you are a computer graphics fan you will love all the action scenes in this OVA.  The characters are good, though in this DVD they haven't been explored in a lot of depth, it's mostly just premise.  So far the primary plot is pretty cloudy, though this could be partially due to the fan subs.  It seems like it has a lot of potential, but I'll have to wait for the other two DVD's to find out.",1145923200,,538,4.085714285714285
2517312,5,B000EDWLXC,"I placed an order for KARAS after I saw the opening sequence of the first OVA on the Web. The 2D, CGI and awesome gothic composed music (not some blasting crap heavy metal) mixture gave me the impression of that this is something special and a lot of artistic values have been put in.

More to come after I received the DVD.",1143417600,5,324,4.225806451612903

2517316,5,B000EDWLXC,"This anime is fun to watch. This anime is a little serious and somewhat hard to follow, but is somewhat interesting to watch. This anime features a being known as Karas who fights deadly monsters that feed on humans. Karas can be reborn as different people when one Karas is defeated. Karas also helps heal the spirits that are injured in the human world. This anime has some forms of gore so I wouldn't recommend this anime for young children. I do highly recommend this anime to hardcore anime fans or any fans of manga.",1356912000,,522,4.505263157894737

Action, Aventure, Fun, likeable characters,great effects, great visuals, good looking characters, a good story, even if you have to watch it twice and watch Karas the Revelation to completely understand, which I Did. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU WATCH BOTH AND READ THE MOVIE SUMMARY/FACTS BEFORE VIEWING THEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON INITIALLY. In fact, I just rented this movie again so that I can watch it and Karas the Revelation together again. THAT BEING SAID, DON'T GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MOVIE IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND it's just that the plot isn't laid out in an elementary fashion. I am so impressed by these two movies, that I plan to purchase the dvd of both movies to add to my collection of movie favorites.  I also recommend Vampire Slayer D and Danta's Inferno which are also excellent MOVIES!",1275264000,,1048,4.721311475409836
2517318,4,B000EDWLXC,"Imagine if every city chose a special champion to defeat monstrous mechanical demons -- becoming the armored superhuman known as Karas.

That's the concept behind ""Karas - The Prophecy,"" the first half of a sprawling, lushly animated series about a mystery hero who spans the worlds of demons and humans. The rather underdeveloped characters hamper the story somewhat, but the scintillating animation and explosive action sequences make this a brilliant experience -- and the twisty-turny plot doesn't hurt either.

Two black-armored men engage in an explosive aerial battle, until ex-Karas Eko triumphs over his successor. Three years later, a young doctor named Otoha awakens in an enchanted house, under the command of the city's avatar Yurine.

At around this time, Tokyo is being attacked by the gruesome cyborg demons called Mikura, and harmless small demons are falling seriously ill. Otoha -- the new Karas -- is charged to destroy the Mikura, who are also being hunted by the mysterious superhuman Nue, and investigated by demon-obsessed cop Sagisaki and his skeptical partner Kure.

But Eko has a plan in mind for defeating this new Karas and getting ahold of Yurine. When a battle between Otoha and the Mikura takes a nasty turn, Nue's true nature is finally revealed -- and when the Karas is called on to defeat a gruesome spider-Mikura, Eko takes the opportunity to target the source of Otoha's power... and his life as well.

""Karas - The Prophecy"" is a bit of a brain-teaser -- several parts of it (including the first several scenes) don't make any sense until you see all of it. And there are three subplots which seem only mildly connected to each other. Then you go back and watch again, and suddenly all the little hints and disjointed puzzle pieces snap neatly into place.

Fortunately the twisting plot is riddled with moments of quiet beauty (Otoha tending to the sickly demons), humour (Nue chatting with an adorable little snail-child), and poignancy (the whole story about Sagisaka's mentally-ill daughter). And there's plenty of horror speckling the story, especially the Mikura with their glowing eyes and metallic roars. The height of freakiness is undoubtedly a girl dessicating into a mummy as she talks to her friend.

But what truly sets ""Karas - the Prophecy"" apart is the action and animation. Every fight with a Mikura is a kinetic, razor-sharp mingling of swordplay and acrobatics, full of bloody spiderwebs and water attacks. And the animation is simply stunning -- everything is depicted realistically, but with exquisitely glowing colours, deep soft shadows and lots of brilliant little details. For example: the spiky raven armor, the blinking Karas talisman, and the vast epic sweeps across a snow-covered Tokyo.

Unfortunately ""Karas - The Prophecy is recognizably the first half of a story. Not only does it end on a massive cliffhanger, but some of the characters feel... unfinished, as though their development is yet to come.

Otoha is one of these -- he's a nice guy with a good heart, but he's something of a blank until the last scenes, though Stan Staley is brilliant here. Eko gives off a feeling of ennui and bitterness as a Karas-turned-supernatural-mob-boss, which is somewhat dampened by Matthew Lillard's lifeless performance. But Nue is a brilliant piece of work -- a monstrous, unnatural creature struggling to overcome his base self.

""Karas - The Prophecy"" is obviously the first half of a whole, but it's a brilliant half -- richly animated and haunting. And it leaves you hungry for the second part.",1230768000,,3562,5.0528109028960815

2517320,5,B000EDWLXC,I was very very happy with this movie. It came early and was in perfect condition! Thanks!,1223942400,,90,4.352941176470588
2517321,4,B000EDWLXC,"Karas: The Prophecy is the first of two installments of this Tatsunoko Productions movie series (Gatchaman, Speed Racer), honoring their 40th anniversary. The Karas movies were created and directed by Keiichi Sato, who also contributed to several other anime works including Big O and Wolf's Rain. Overseas licensing was given to Manga Entertainment for distributing and voice-over dubbing. The English audio track features the vocal talents of Jay Hernandez (Hostel, World Trade Center), Matthew Lillard (Scream) and Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly).
Karas: The Prophecy went on to be one of the top-selling anime DVDs in the US last year.

PRODUCTION and ANIMATION
Spectacular is the word for Karas's animation. The quality is up there with Hollywood grade animations, with its smooth movement and beautifully crafted character designs. But most notable was the 2-D/3-D fusion. Karas is one of the first anime productions in which I have seen two-dimensional animation really blend nicely with 3-D CGI graphics. Initially, the original announcement trailer (available on DVD) featured some sample blends that were typical compared to other anime and simply looked terrible in comparison to the final product. The magnificent detailing really add a lot to Karas final animation. The visuals alone make this film worth watching.
The rendering of the 2-D artwork also appears to be top-notch quality as well. The rendering and tone of the 2-D animation seemed very un-anime like and is almost reminiscent of the last theatrical American 2-D animated films we saw (such as Dreamworks Sinbad & Road to El Dorado or Disney's Treasure Planet). It is still anime but with a Western touch to it.

SOUND and MUSIC
Here is yet another area where Karas really shines. Again, very theatrical. All the sound effect were crisp, clear, and realistic. Volume of voices was all balanced well to create depth and a lifelike dialogue experience.
One of Karas's biggest benefactors is its musical score performed by the international-renowned Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. The music is professionally played and executed with emotion and dynamic qualities. Simply a thrill to listen to. However, there is one downside: there is a pretty limited track list most likely to the budget being spent on the Prague Orchestra performing what song tracks they have and/or animation. But once you've gotten used to the epic orchestral tunes, it's not a problem. Bottom line: Limited music selection but at least it's performed extremely well.

The DVD includes two versions of audio: regular 2.0 stereo and a special Dolby Surround EX 6.1 mix which just adds to the intensity of this series. (hopefully next)

STORY
Here in the story department is where Karas takes a hit. So far through the first movie its story line just isn't anything really good: just average. Aside from that, the storyline is almost completely implied, if not too implied. There are so many major subtle aspects of the story the viewer probably won't pick up on all of them. After viewing the film for a second time, there were many moments where I thought, 'Oh I see...' as I noticed small details that added to the story.

Characters are a unique bunch but individually nothing incredibly special as of yet. We have the stoic, 'man of few words' hero, his equally emotionless and mysterious partner/master Yurine, a ditzy reporter girl, a slick pistol-wielding anti-hero, a young confused investigator and his troubled strong-headed elderly partner. By far it is this elderly character, Mr. Sagisaka who has any story depth to him and an actual background. Oh and of course we have our villains who are all your typical villains. And we still hack yet to see the master villain, Ekou, in any action besides the movie intro...
Although is minimal character development and low story progression, I anticipate, from the ending of Prophecy, that the next installment Revelation will indeed be one and hopefully provide at least a satisfactory finish.

The Karas series is has very strong production values and a great studio working behind it. The visuals and orchestral music score is enough to make this one of the must-see anime of this decade.

Karas: The Prophecy slips in with a FOUR out of FIVE.

+ = Scintillating, fluid animation, practically seamless 2D/3D hybrid technique, high-quality musical score performed by Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, on English dub - solid cast featuring professional American actors.
- = Extremely subtle story, static characters, limited song track, annoying cliffhanger.",1212796800,,4551,5.190735694822888
2517322,5,B000EDWLXC,"Incredible fight scenes for a about 1/3 of the movie with an amazingly confusing storyline for the rest of it. The story is explained in ""Karas: The Revelation"", but that does not cut down on its intensity at all. If anything, I'd think you'd pay more attention to try to figure it out.

Movie opens and closed with a fight scene. The fights are mostly cgi incorperated into an animated backround. They take the animation seriously though, from animating cold foggy breath the the rainbow pixelization that you get from touching a moniter screen.",1202342400,,546,4.808510638297872
2517323,5,B000EDWLXC,"Karas is one of the best Anime i have Ever seen

The animation part is great, good story, and Characters
i do recommend it a lot for everyone.",1199923200,,142,4.071428571428571
2517324,5,B000EDWLXC,"Karas is one of the most beautifully-rendered presentations I've ever seen. Hand drawings and computer graphics are seamlessly blended, and the attention to the detail is outstanding. There is enough chaos during action sequences to get you into it, but unlike many recent American action film releases you can still tell what's going on.

Karas doesn't seem to try to reinvent the wheel as far as original story concepts go, but they don't need to. They take that wheel and give it a whole new shine.

The Karas and Mikura designs are awesome, and viewers may enjoy seeing their slight resemblance to other anime movies and series. The Karas designs in particular remind me of Bio-Booster Armor Guyver.

The action scenes, like the rest of the movie, are beautifully done and extremely detailed, and the Karas movements are very fluid, making it easy on the eyes.

There is absolutely no lacking in the sound effect or music departments either - it sounds like there are some tracks presented in this OVA series that could definitely reach legendary status, particularly the introduction.

Karas to me has great replay value - the details of the story (particularly the identity of certain characters) became much more clear to me after a couple more viewings. For full effect/enlightenment you may want to watch it both in English dub and Japanese sub. I prefer the Japanese sub myself, as the actors sound much more convincing to me. And rewatching such a beautiful OVA series to understand the story is definitely not a bad thing!",1199232000,,1534,4.9073359073359075
2517325,1,B000EDWLXC,"The slick CG fight scenes aren't enough to pull off this anime.  The story is a mess.  It is incoherent and jumps all over the place.  It's all mood with no substance.  I don't care about the ""brooding"" Karas character or the other wannabe ultra cool characters who walk around aloof like rejects from a James Dean audition.  Save yourself some time and get something with originality, story and characters (like Ghost in the Shell, Paprika, Akira or Porco Roso) rather than a pitiful patchwork of rip offs that Karas is.",1198368000,,521,4.681318681318682
2517326,5,B000EDWLXC,"Just like my other review of the second part to this series, all I can say is AWSOME!! Worth the money for any fans collection. Definitly worth having.",1194998400,,151,4.428571428571429
2517327,5,B000EDWLXC,This is a great movie!!!! I can't wait for the 2nd one to come out. A must BUY!!!!!,1187827200,,83,3.6666666666666665
2517328,2,B000EDWLXC,"KARAS is a highly produced, beautiful piece of work, packed with action, CG, effects, and exquisite design. But perhaps too much, as KARAS comes across like a pent up teen orgasm. It's an unfocused mess spilling everywhere, without any intent. It's all about the action. No foreplay, no cuddling afterwards, just a hyper-heated kettle letting out pressurized steam. Was there a story somewhere in this? The CG guys forgot to render out a coherent plot and character development! It's as if a rabid director with intense visions (and a lot of money) escaped from prison and molested a top notch animation studio.

If they took 30% of the budget out of the visuals and put it into a real story department, it STILL would have been great looking, and it would have had a good story... a watchable story, too.

But alas, it was not meant to be. What a shame.

Fast forward through this mess. You'll see all the great work, without having to bother trying to decipher the bad script.",1185580800,,978,4.674418604651163
2517329,5,B000EDWLXC,"As soon as this anime began I knew I was going to like it.  It was instant action with organic and dynamic camera work.  The camera really gives you the feeling of speed that the characters are moving at!  The story is very well written and is complemented by great voice acting!  I can not wait for September when the second set of 3 episodes of this OVA are suppose to be released!  I went down and pre-ordered mine directly after watching this first set.
This dvd is a great buy if you love action oriented animes with a great story line too boot!",1183593600,,550,4.25
2517330,5,B000EDWLXC,"This beautiful film is candy for the eyes and mind.  The traditional animation is flawlessly blended with the CGI, giving a wider variety of visual effects that are unique and ingenius in their creativity.

The story itself is a bit confusing the first time around.  It mixes the modern day world with otherworldly happenings.  A basic knowledge of Japanese mythic and supernatural beings and their cultural standings would be helpful, but not neccessary.

I really like the animation style and character designs.  The movie is beautiful and extremely interesting.  Hopefully the sequel will answer so many questions left over from this film.",1183420800,,642,5.235294117647059
2517331,5,B000EDWLXC,"Darkly excellent.  For the price, you can't miss but the end leaves you hanging and in need of the sequel.  It's that good!  But it's only half the story!  Or part of the story.  Could this be the beginning of a series of feature length episodes?  Now that's exciting!  I can't think of anything to say that's bad about Karas.  Everything is very well done.  It's just not finished.  Buy it!  Or just get it!  You won't be disappointed.",1183161600,,436,4.379746835443038
2517332,5,B000EDWLXC,"This is some of the best anime I've seen.  The visuals are great.  The action sequences are some of the best.  I compare it to the fight scene between Cloud Strife and Sephiroth in Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children.

Go the the extras menu and highlight the top most extra. Then, press the right arrow button and you should be highlighting a spot in the upper right corner.  It might take a few tries, but it is well worth it if you liked the english voice actors!

This was a great movie and I want to buy it as soon as I have the money!  The animation was spectacular and music was...AWESOME!  I'm not a big fan of CG animation and robot/weird armor, but somehow in this movie it didn't really bother me!

2517337,1,B000EDWLXC,"Thank God this was only a rental. It look very promising during the first couple of minutes of aerial fighting. But you quickly realize that this anime is nothing more than one big lump of nonsense.

You have been warned.",1168300800,3,284,4.775510204081633
2517338,3,B000EDWLXC,"Karas: The Prophecy is apparently the first part of an OVA anime series created by the guy behind such classics as Gatchaman, and Speed Racer. But it seems he's trying something new these days, and that newness manifests itself in the form of Karas.

Karas begins with a fight. A beautifully choreographed fight that makes the pleasure center of my brain that loves amazing visuals go crazy. In fact, all the fights in Karas are beautifully choreographed. Art direction is top notch here, and animation is never lacking. Each frame looks like a real work of art, with beautiful shadows, lighting, and original character designs. The style is very cool, and a little bit more realistic than most anime, as the characters actually have lips. All the men are also bishonen, so female anime fans will definitely like this series if they're into stuff like that.

However behind the stunning visual effects there is very little meat. The plot is hardly there at all, and the only character that we get to know a little bit is the inspector who is convinced that demons exist. The other characters include his assistant, who thinks he's crazy, a weird guy who seems to be harboring some secret power, a guy in a cowboy hat who for some reason doesn't appear much after the first 20 minutes, and a weird androgynous kid who seems to be commanding people to do different things.

There are a lot of other characters too, but I doubt they actually matter that much. None of them are developed, and any place where they could be developed is scrapped in order to fit in another beautiful fight scene. At the end of the day, however, visuals just don't account for the lack of coherent plot or interesting characters. In 10 years this level of animation will probably be standard anyway, and then all you'll have is a generic looking series with bishonen guys and no replay value. I feel sorry for the people who had to spend so much time animating something that is much more fluff than substance.",1166227200,2,1987,4.671428571428572
2517339,5,B000EDWLXC,"Karas was a masterpeice. Anime at it's finest. It made me angry though. The ending, supposed to be a cliff hanger (since it is a supposed series), wasn't very good at all. The animation style was excellent and voice acting was spot on.

2517340,5,B000EDWLXC,"Cons, I had to watch the movie twice to get the story and fully appreciate the fight scenes as they are fast.

Pros: Great graphics, good/average story (once you get it), definately look forward to the next volumn. The fighting in the movie is nice (again you may have to watch it twice to get it).

The movie is worth buying.",1163635200,,326,4.327868852459017
2517341,5,B000EDWLXC,"At first glance it seems like the movie isn't worth what little money you paid for it. The characters (on the back of the box) looks like something out of the 80s and the beginning is just so unfocused and slow. You literally have no idea what's going on.

I had thought I wasted my money on this and wouldn't even bother to buy the second volume. But my mind change when suddenly the story line began to pick up and broken ends were tied together. Things started to make sense.

The fight scenes in this are too short, but there are quite a few fight scenes to pass around and are to die for.

The end of the movie leaves you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.

So, if you're looking for a good anime series that's even balanced with a good story plot and animation, but don't want to spend a hundred dollars, or more, trying to keep track of all the episodes this mini series is perfect.",1162857600,,897,4.167630057803469
2517342,3,B000EDWLXC,This anime story was confusing and had no backround what so ever about the story. The animation was good but choppy and too fast during the fighting scenes to see all that was going on. All in all not worth the price.,1161388800,2,217,4.190476190476191
2517343,2,B000EDWLXC,I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused.

It has the right amount of adventure to quench my thirst for it. The voices are superb (alot of the voice talent i didn't know it was them until the credits). The anime was beautifully done. The CG couldn't have been done better. The whole anime was intense had me rooting for everyone (except for the bad guys). And the storyline.... *looks dreamy* WOW!

Now there's six dvd's (three have been released in Japan) and I can hardly wait to see the next one.

This has to be one of the best anime's out there. If you're an anime fan or just like a good, heart pounding adventure with some really good fighting scenes this is the anime for you.",1158451200,,793,4.351351351351352

The first time I watched this, i Iliked it regardless of my misunderstanding of the entire story. But the second time, it all clicked wonderfully. The entire thing, as much as it doesnt make sense, clicks together magically. I guess that comes with all animes and their nonlinear storylines. Overall, 3rd times a charm. I cant tell you how many times I've bought a movie/anime and felt regret. No regrets at all with this one. I'm even proud to own it.",1157328000,,553,4.54
2517346,4,B000EDWLXC,"I agree with all of the points made in the other reviews.  I enjoyed this anime for the fight scenes and the depth.  The fight scenes, as everyone says, are incredible.  Fast paced, complicated and well animated, they keep you watching.  The credits during the opening became a bit tedious during the last few since they interrupt the aerial combat which CAN be tricky to keep track of.  However the remainder of the fight scenes are great.

  It is important to note, however, that any comments you find about lack of narrative are absolutely true.  There is no explanation of ANYTHING that is happening, not from any of the characters who have such knowledge nor any dramatic narrator.  This is something I actually enjoyed about the story.  During the first ten minutes I was blown away and completely oblivious as to the REASON why what was happening, was happening.  However, this is a story where one can piece together the various elements through watching the story.  This isn't to say, treat it like a detective story, but rather to say, while watching, you will see characters do or say certain things that make you think ""I think he is this kind of character and this is his backstory etc...""  Your experience with other movies, anime, and science fiction will guide your intuition.  Put simply, the narration is non-existent, so you create it.  I enjoyed watching this story and talking with my friends about who was who and what their goal was.  The depth is present because the lack of narration allows you to wonder at the reality of the situation.  Bit by bit the questions of who, where, when, why, and how are all answered, but while you watch there is an alluring freedom to the lack of explanation.  By leaving the story up in the air, it draws you in with the tantalizing possibilities it suggests.  In the first few minutes you are presented with the presence of transforming warriors with incredible powers, a seemingly normal girl with abnormal importance, and a police detective who seems to know more than most.  The amazing story that this world COULD become drew me in like a terrible crime with no apparent motive.  Why are they fighting, why is she important, what is the detectives connection to anything?  I watched and continue to watch this story to attempt to answer these questions, and thus far the answers have not dissapointed me, nor the creation of more questions.  I highly recommend this Anime to anyone interested in fantasy or science fiction despite the requirement of patience.",1157155200,2,2524,4.775981524249422

2517348,4,B000EDWLXC,"After watching this one time through you will either think it was an awesome production of action and effects (geared towards those with a small attention span and thirst for raw action rather than a good story line) or that it is a complete mess. I admit that I enjoyed what I thought was mindless entertainment, but at the same time was left slightly disappointed with what I thought was a Hollywoodish Anime (not a good thing). However I was fortunate to see one OVA  at a time, therefore I watched the first OVA about three times, the second two times and at last all three together (these three are what make up the contents of this DVD). So by the time I finished this first half of the story I pretty much understood it.

This DVD entails a complicated kaleidoscope of events that eventually jumble into a collage of a story.  Honestly this is a very good anime with a very good story once you are able to breath it all in. It appears as a mess because the director throws everything at you almost at once; however I believe that is what he intends. As the story goes on the knots that make up the story untwine (OVA to OVA). So expect the first OVA to be the most complicated and confusing. but if you Read the summary first the story will make more sense the first time you watch it.

Finally, the animation and CG is second to none. It is an extremely beautiful anime.

You spend a lot of time early on saying ""HUH?"", but things slowly start to clear up.  Hopefully, the next installment will tie up a lot of strings.

The fights?  Way cool.  Often too fast to keep up with who's doing what, let alone who's winning.  I think that's the point, though.  A lot of the combat literally takes place in the blink of an eye.

You're left to guess what is going on and how these characters relate to each other and the overall story.  The fight sequences can be entirely too fast to follow.

All you truly know is he is in a coma.

After finally giving in, went out and brought it.  Let me say that I have watched it over a dozen times and each time the feeling of (Damn) rush over me.  The art work is primeo!  The story reels you in, and the soundtrack is one of a kind.  Sets the mood and is excellent!!  I now sit waiting for the rest of the story.  Who is Otoha?  Why was he chosen or how did he chose himself?  Question after question.  I would suggest this anime to everyone that likes state of the art anime along with one of the best stories of the year.  Come on part II!!",1149292800,3,715,3.8413793103448275
2517356,5,B000EDWLXC,"What we have here is a highly underrated title with some truly impressive animation, music, voicing and an engaging story. I'll start with the story however as that is where this title gets most of its complaints. It is a complicated story that certainly isn't told in the clearest of fashions. Of course, it is still told and though it probably takes two viewings to really grasp the story it is all there clearly enough aside from the obvious factors that will show in the 2nd volume. It is a story that makes you to pick up on it rather than simply forcing itself on you and to really fully understand it I seriously recommend viewing it at least twice.

Now on to the animation, which is an amazing display of hybrid traditional/CGI animation which is put together very effectively. Neither type seems lower quality than the other, both the CGI and the standard 2D are very well done and have very fluid movements. The detail is quite impressive and the budget for this title really shows in the animation.

The music has a very cinematic and dramatic feel and is one of this titles strongest points. The voice acting is well done as well, both in English and in Japanese.

The latest big hit in the anime world has been Advent Children, but I must say honestly that I enjoy Karas so much more than Advent Children. The animation isn't quite as detailed in Karas but the movements seem a lot more real and organic and the action actually gives the illusion of action more effectively than anything in Advent Children did. The story, while a little difficult to pick up on at first, is a much more in depth and quality story than what Advent Children provides and while I will freely admit that not everyone may be able to ""get it"" from the start all the elements are there, you just need to pick up on them and it will take a few viewings to do so.

I highly recommend this one though, it's a very well done anime in every department and while the story isn't laid out for the viewer perfectly it is still all there regardless and just requires some perception to really get it. It's a relatively inexpensive title and it's worth every penny.",1149120000,8,2146,4.4808184143222505
2517357,5,B000EDWLXC,"Karas is a wonderful blend of excellent story, stunnig animation and audio (both voice and music) to blow your mind.

This review is in defence of criticisms of this movie.

It has been said that the story is hard to follow.

However i would say that about most good anime the first time you watch it, also this is only part 1 and so the story is not yet complete.

The story has been criticized for being nothing we haven't seen before.

Ok so we have seen a hero fighting blood sucking evil before, but this is far removed from any other movie of that genre i ever remember seeing.

the camera work and choice of cuts has been said to make it choppy, but does it not add to the tention and visual power of the piece?

This movie is easily one of the best.

Once the series is complete i'm sure it will take it's place among the classics such as Ghost In The Shell, Ninja Scroll and Akira.",1148947200,,890,4.16374269005848
2517358,5,B000EDWLXC,"I'm writing this for your average unbiased viewer of not just anime but anything cool.  I would say that this is a man's man movie, but I had some chick watch it and she thought it was pretty good, I don't think you have to be a critic to understand that if a female can appreciate this movie that it must be pivotal for the anime demographic.

If I had to list the repertoire of anime I own for credit, I'd list Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Ninja Scroll (series and OAV), Berserk, definitely the Ghost In The Shell: SAC series, Dual: Parallel Trouble Adventure and even Tenchi as some of my favorites, I got all sorts of series here, there, and in between but those are some of my favorites.  Just goes to show there's eclecticism in my choice and no bias.

The animation of Karas is unparalleled!  If you take one thing away from this review, it better be that the fight sequences are stunning.  Anybody who's seen this is instantly amazed by the opening of Karas.  The fight choreography is amazingly detailed, the movement of the characters is fluid, construable, and physically realistic.  However of course there are supernatural elements fo the fight scenes!  They're as innovative now as the Matrix was when you first watched it...  The story is gripping and I get the same response from every viewer who's watched it with me, everybody wants more.  WHERE'S THE REST OF THE STORY???

The voice acting is what you'd come to expect of your typical protagonist, antagonist, supporting characters, etc.  Nothing disappoints at all.  Everything is as you'd expect for a real life counterpart of the characters.  No cheesy voice dubs except for one character, some weird little water creature, but it's nothing to cheapen the overall experience of Karas.  The animation is breath taking...to give this series anything less than 5-stars is inequitable.  To be fair and say the least, even the worst critic would have to acknowledge the avant garde nature of this film.

Anyway, to summarize, do yourself a favor and get this, so for this price, you have to ask yourself--can you afford NOT to get this???  Don't pass it up and regret it for the rest of your natural life...",1148860800,,2167,4.70026525198939
2517359,5,B000EDWLXC,"To begin with this is definitely one of the most `action' packed anime that I have ever seen, and I have seen many. As for action I refer more to the high quality and astonishing action scenes. Obviously, I will restrain myself of criticizing the story because this is only the first part of supposedly two (the other one is called Karas: Reveletion)
Apart from it, some said something like that the story was weak or whatsoever. To begin with, if you have seen Blade, there was basically a vampire hunter chasing and killing vampires in order to safe the world. Here we have a similar pattern in which Karas is trying to stop the old Karas in order to safe Tokyo but the story goes beyond that (sorry guys, you'll have to watch it :-) ).

Outline of the Story:

So that to avoid confusing the ones who have not seen the anime I will restrain myself from using names but concentrate more on the story.

In Tokyo, two worlds are one, meaning that the material world (the world as we know it) and the spiritual world (ghosts, spirits etc.) coexist together. The ones that keep the order is a little girl, who is something like a guide and protector to Karas, and Karas (a man who belongs to both worlds, well something among these lines, and something like the ultimate warrior). The problem is that ghosts are attacking and killing people. The reason, `Karas 1' (former Karas who turned into a bad guy - bad Karas :-P) wants to seize power over Tokyo. `Karas 1', used to be Karas but he was discussed with the way humans behaved and left `a job opening'. Then he returns to seize control over Tokio and also `smoked' `Karas 2' (his replacement). After a couple of years a new Karas is found, let us call him `Karas 3' (the good guy); who is basically the one who stands in-between of `Karas 1' and his success.

To all this come along a guy (belonging to the good guys) who uses all sorts of guns in order to kill demons and he himself is not human. In addition, a police officer who investigates the deaths (something like X-Files) and his partner, a father who wants to prove to the others that the spiritual  world exists, a female reporter who also escaped a demon attack; plus all sorts of demons.

The anime, till this point, falls in the category of: science fiction/ action / and fantasy.

Music:
The music is absolutely fabulous, which is a successful combination of the Prague Orchestra (for the ones who are not so familiar with this kind of music, the Prague Orchestra is considered to be one of the best in the world) and pop/rock music.

Animation:
Very good (when not fighting)
Superb (when fights are going on), combination of 2D and 3D

Dubs:
Very good and professional done, they have hired for this reason three known Hollywood actors (for the English dub)

Price:
Cheap for that kind of anime and has extras such as a comic book, trailers, interviews and the making of Karas.

Recommended or not?

Highly recommended !!!",1148515200,5,2939,4.5141242937853105
2517360,5,B000EDWLXC,"The combination of 2-D and 3-D animation in Karas: The Prophecy is absolutely stunning, though it is lauded enough in other reviews. The story, on the other hand, has unjustly been given a lot of criticism. Of key importance is the fact that this movie is only part one of two. Much is left unanswered at the close of this film. It is a complicated film, and will no doubt take several viewings for the pieces to start to fit together. This is not a bad thing; on the contrary, I was pleased upon the second viewing to notice certain things that I had missed before. Karas challenges you to pay attention and think about the events it shows. This film is not for viewers interested only in amazing action sequences (which the film executes wonderfully), but for those who also enjoy a challenging plot that will not immediately reveal its twists. I eagerly await the second half of this amazing film.",1148342400,2,900,4.561728395061729
2517361,4,B000EDWLXC,"The American release of Karas: The Prophecy has been compared to Batman, which is a little misleading.  The Karas is sort of a ""Spiritual Batman""....that is he doesn't mess around with petty purse-snatchers but goes straight for the denizens of the demon world who ambiguously threaten all of humanity.  In fact, he doesn't really interact with the ""real"" world as humans know it.  The story is a little vague but The Prophecy is just part one of two (the Japanese version is a 6 part series and from what I've heard 'The Prophecy' release is the first 3 parts spliced together.)

The animation and action sequences are amazing but would be more enjoyable with a better developed storyline. The musical score is excellent and powerful for the over the top action sequences.  I highly recommend this movie just for the animation if nothing else.  Hopefully the second half will fill in the gaps in the story and make it a more complete experience overall.",1147478400,3,954,4.786585365853658

2517363,5,B000EDWLXC,"I don't usually dig OVAs all that often. I myself, enjoy TV episode versions of animes the best.. however, Karas is quite the exception. The animation is amazing, but on top of that they've managed to blend 3D CGI into scenes perfectly. Something I haven't quite seen so prolific in an anime before.

The story is pretty unique and interesting and while you may find it a tad confusing the first time viewing, your second viewing (trust me, you'll want to watch it again) will help clear up things better.

Probably my only complaint with this release is that they decided to merge 3 OVA eps together to make a ""movie"" out of it. There are a few awkward moments where you can tell the credits should have rolled but instead a new scene starts up. I don't see why they couldn't have just kept the episodes separated on here... don't see the need to make a movie out of it. Oh well.. a minor complaint i suppose.

I look forward to ""part 2"" AKA the next 3 episodes",1147219200,8,962,4.363128491620111
2517364,4,B000EDWLXC,"Karas was really hyped up a lot, at least from what I personally heard and read about it. It's a terrific anime that is groundbreaking in some areas, but it also has some severe faults, so it does not deserve all the hype it gets.

The Good - Obviously, the fighting scenes. The mix of 2D and 3D graphics is spectacular. The directing and fight choreography during these scenes is even more spectacular. I've seen a lot of CG shows with awful 3D fight choreography, such as Final Fantasy Advent Children. It's also critically important in shows like Karas that one knows how to blend the 3D CG in a way that does not look out of place next to the non-CG scenes, whether they be live-action or cartoon. Karas does a great job of making the 3D CG animations fairly consistent with the style of the 2D cartoon animations that it uses. Although to be honest, I think the 3D still graphics are slightly too photo-realistic and would blend better with live-action than cartoon anime. Animation-wise though, the 3D and 2D in Karas work together very well.

The music is also very good in Karas. The BGM is well-composed, like good American orchestral action movie music. The ending song is a bit different, a Japanese rock/pop song, but it is very nice also.

The Bad - Practically everything except the fighting scenes. I initially took a very optimistic view towards these scenes, but in the end I have to say that the non-fighting parts of this show are awfully done. It seems as if Karas turns into an entirely different show when no one is fighting. The directing style is different and just plain boring. The way the show plays out is also poorly planned. Things drag on for no reason, and viewers are left confused as to what is going on simply because most of what they are seeing is irrelevant to the main story issues.

The two detectives that drive the non-fighting parts of Karas are UTTERLY useless. They have done nothing of significance to contribute to the storyline thus far, and should never have existed. They only cause the show to drag on and be three times as long as it would be without them. This DVD only has the 1st half of Karas on it though, so perhaps the detectives will play a more critical role later on. They better, from my point of view, I've wasted so much time looking at their ugly mugs.

In a similar vein, the 2D anime drawing style in this series is not something I'm fond of. The drawings are almost nasty bad. The only people I could stand to look at were Yurine, Otoha, Nue, and the female Karas. Everyone else was ugly and nasty to the extreme and repeatedly struck me with temporary blindness.

Overall though, for the 9 to 15 dollars this DVD is going for, it's a total bargain and everyone should pick it up. It's a far better show than Final Fantasy Advent Children, coming out at the same time in the same places.",1146787200,11,2856,4.482692307692307
2517365,5,B000EDWLXC,"... but in a good way!

This is simply a fantastic anime movie.  Even the casual fan of anime and animation in general will enjoy Karas: The Prophecy.  The action sequences are spectacular, expanding on the anime themes of transformation, beast/machine, and demons in truly epic fashion.  Yes, the plot and variety of characters may leave your head spinning, but that only means you may need to watch it twice ... which you will want to do anyway.

Don't let the affordability of the DVD put you off.  Cheap doesn't always mean ""cheap"".  In this case, in means affordable, quality entertainment that doesn't scimp on production values.  My only complaint would be that the 2nd part is not due until sometime this fall.  That is just too long to wait.",1146614400,2,750,4.707692307692308
2517366,5,B000EDWLXC,"Even though this is only the first volume of a two part series, I'm sure that Karas is going to be one of the best, if not the best, anime of 2006. It has everything that all good anime have, including excellent animation, both 2D and 3D, which is blended in Karas so perfectly it's difficult to tell difference between the two; the music is good as well, with emotional tracks that highlight the intense, non-stop action; and of course their is the excellent voice-acting on both the English and Japanese tracks. The only thing I was unsure of was the story, that's because it wasn't yet finished.

From what I gained, though, it follows a Karas, a warrior capable of entering both the spiritual and physical world to do battle, who is thrust into a battle with a former Karas known as Eko, a man who is meddling in the two worlds of existence in Tokyo. Spirits are growing sick and humans are dying left and right. To make matters worse, monstrous, robotic demons known as Mikura are prowling the streets and Karas must put a stop to them in order to save the humans who are the Mikuras' food source.

Karas is somewhat of a cross between Blood (for it's dark settings), Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (for the crisp animation), and Kakurenbo (for the elements of horror). So for fans of the mentioned anime, this will definitely be an anime for you. What am I saying... Karas is an anime that really shouldn't be missed if you consider yourself a fan of anime. It has the power to stand right alongside Akira, Ninja Scroll, and Ghost in the Shell as anime's classics.

A quick note on the DVD: It's very cheap, as in inexpensive, yet it's loaded with special features, including a mini-comic book (not manga) with a special Karas adventure. You don't expect a DVD to have this much for so little, which only adds to the appeal of Karas.",1146441600,29,1836,4.5075075075075075

I cant remember the last time any anime, scratch that, any movie for that fact has drawn me in and kept my attention all the way through. A bit confusing at first what is going on, but it unravels throughout the movie.

The 2D and 3D effects mix together so well, you stop looking for the differences and just enjoy the show. I'm telling you now though, you won't be doing yourself or anyone watching with you any justice without a descent sound system and at least a 27 inch screen.

There's no doubt that the ending of this movie will have you craving more, but the next one in the series doesnt come out till september. So I say get your jollies off now and enjoy the best thing since peanut butter and jelly. No kidding though, it is on par with Final Fantasy: Advent Children and Akira.

So Dark Horse Comics really bagged a biggie when their one-shot comic Karas was adapted into a 6-episode OVA series. The original comic written by Phil Amara(Spyboy)received moderate success in 2004, and then became a full-on superhero anime by Tatsunoko Production, who already have a history of superhero anime like Speed Racer, Gatchaman Casshern, and Teknoman. So they mixed on some flawless cel-shaded animation to create this ""Batman meets The Crow"" hybrid!

 In modern day Japan, sections of Tokyo major city has their own guardian spirit known as a Karas guarding it. Each Karas makes a contract with a cat-like spirit called Yurine who all share a similar appearance(except in hair color), however Eko, the Karas of Shinjuku, rebels and takes over his city. Three years later, Eko has amassed a mafia of demonic ""mikura"" to control Shinjuku, but a new Yurine is born and contracts the comatose ex-Yakuza swordsman Otoha to be the new Karas to take Eko down. Along with this, we see how the lives of common people effected by the supernatural happenings going on, including a special two-man police investigation unit, a hapless mascot girl, and the local yokai who try to survive in the ensuing chaos. Most notable is the outcasted mikura Nue who seeks to free his brother from Eko's control, but both of the brothers are part Eko's scheme to seperate Shinjuku into it's own kingdom. When the mikuru start branching out all over the city, Otoha reemerges as Karas to fight the Eko, along with a female Karas from another part of Tokyo. Each Karas takes on the appearance of a crow-like samurai with the ability to turn into a miniature saber jet, or a juiced-up Batmobile, so the final battle between this trio of Karas makes for an incredible showdown.

The OVA series was release in English by Manga Entertainment, but as two separate compilation films, Karas: The Prophecy and Karas: The Revelation, which was probably a bit confusing for anyone who picked up one of these titles on their own without knowing it was part of a series. Karas obtained enough popularity in Japan to include the actual Karas character in Capcom Vs. Tatsunoko, but its release in America didn't have as much lasting power, slightly due to a serious lack of exposition involving the nature of these supernatural beings and how their existence is interwoven with the common human world. The dub is exceptional with Jay Hernandez and Mathew Lillard, plus Piper Perabo and Cree Summer both voicing Yurine with Summer replacing Perabo for the second film. The anime has been released in America as two DVD volumes, and a 2-disc DVD set, but so far no English Blu-Ray has been made available outside of the U.K.",1524441600,,2897,4.896130346232179
