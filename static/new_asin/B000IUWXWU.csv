The whole idea of a 'road movie' is that the characters encounter different things and different people along the way and these things and people make an impression.  The story - and there actually is one - is that the boy doesn't want to go in the beginning but when he realizes the significance of the journey, is compelled to finish it on his own.",1192320000,4,410,4.453333333333333
8147527,3,B000IUWXWU,"""The Russian Disease"" is alcoholism. It's one of the most common health concerns in this country, and the efforts of the health authorities to combat it do not yet show sigs of success. This movie is wrapped in the results and portents of this fatal illness. a slow flow of darkness,  fluid darkness or at best a quasi-ocuro portrait of hopelessness.",1187481600,2,350,4.737704918032787
8147528,1,B000IUWXWU,"I very much enjoy movies produced outside the USA and was very let down by this Russian movie.  I found it very hard to complete the vieweing of it, even at 1.5 speed!  Many scenes are extremely SLOW in pace with unnecessary video repetition of things. Acting was OK but not especially good and the story was not interesting. If you want to see an excellent Russian movie, please watch ""The Return"".  There is a world of difference between the two movies in all aspects of ""movie making"". I feel that it is what making a motion picture is all about. Don't bother with Roads to Koktebel.",1171238400,3,586,4.457943925233645
8147529,2,B000IUWXWU,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  Many, many of the scenes are way too long with no action or even narration.  For example, there is one scene where the boy is looking out the door of a box car as the train is moving - and all you see are the trees and fields going by.  Also, the story is very weak, if, indeed there is even a real story there.  To me it was just a collection of encounters with various people along the way.  The only reason I can see for one to watch this movie would be to get some glimpse of how the people live in Russia and the old Soviet Union.",1167782400,4,575,3.8803418803418803
