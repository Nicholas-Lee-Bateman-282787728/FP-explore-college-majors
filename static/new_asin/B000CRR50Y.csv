2472668,4,B000CRR50Y,the first season was better,1415318400,,27,4.6
2472669,5,B000CRR50Y,Perfect gift -- my friend was super impressed that I was ble to get him this.,1410912000,,77,3.875
2472670,5,B000CRR50Y,"Great continuation from Season 1, with twisty plot lines and plenty of atmosphere. I was sorry to see the departure of Michael Fassbender as Azazeal, head of the Nephilim, however, the arrival of a satisfyingly complex Mephistopheles helped a lot, as did the  now teenaged Malachi, half human, half Nephilim, and his machinations. The satisfying end had me wanting more, which, alas, was not to be. Well worth it for fans of the Gothic.",1408752000,,436,4.891891891891892
2472671,5,B000CRR50Y,Works great on my new Sony multi-region DVD player.  Glad to finally have a copy of Season 2.,1408665600,,93,4.166666666666667
2472672,1,B000CRR50Y,"Unfortunately, this is not a review of the DVD since I've been unable to watch it. I did not understand that it is formatted for the UK only, so I can't watch it on my DVD player. This is frustrating as I loved the first season. I wish the descriptions were clearer for dummies like me.",1404950400,,286,4.125
2472673,3,B000CRR50Y,Enjoyed season one immensely so was really looking forward to season two.  It was somewhat disappointing - story shifted to other characters - but am glad I purchased it.,1402704000,,170,4.862068965517241
2472674,1,B000CRR50Y,"I didn't know I couldn't use this on U.S. players. I don't think this would play well even if it did play in the U.S. There are five DVDs packaged into a half-inch container. I don't expect these to be genuine. Probably copies. I need to return them, but I don't have a car.",1392422400,,274,4.092592592592593
2472675,1,B000CRR50Y,"I cannot rate this item. Didn't even open it. Shortly after I ordered, I realized I wouldn't be able to play it here in the US, so I sent the merchant a cancel shipment message right away, but guess they didn't get it. I returned it to the merchant unopened.",1384473600,,258,4.18
2472676,5,B000CRR50Y,"I love this show so much, but I feel like they rushed the story line too much. we go from one episode (spoiler alter) where Cassie doesn't want anything to do with Azazeal to them jumping in bed together... Just saying, they should have taken their time with this story line because it had so much potential.",1373500800,2,308,4.421052631578948
2472677,5,B000CRR50Y,"Please Release Region Free, or at least a Region 1 version of the 2nd Series!! Ideally, BBC would release Series 1&2 on Blu-Ray in HD for Hex! Thanks!",1351555200,,150,4.392857142857143
2472688,5,B000CRR50Y,I loved Season One of this series. I'm sure I'm not the only one in the Region 1 area that has been waiting for Season 2. WILL SOMEONE WHO HAS THE CLOUT PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?!,1341360000,,185,4.027027027027027
2472689,5,B000CRR50Y,"I was lucky to watch season 2 on an all region player. Where season 1 starts off slow and sluggish, season 2 gives us more insight into the characters with some unexpected surprises. All performances are superior and you want to keep watching one episode after another. It kind of draws you in. For me, Leon is the character that shines the most with Thema and Ella excellent as well. Some similarities with Charmed, but season 2 of Hex is better. The only dissapointment was the final episode which I was not sure they knew was the end. On further reflection, it reminded me of the ending to Harry Potter- Half Blood Price, where you see Harry, Ron and Hermine together and are given a sense of the bond they share and the strength they draw from each other. You feel that more danger is on the horizon. You leave Hex feeling the same way and on reflection this is not really so bad. Much more edgy than your traditional ending.",1280793600,11,929,4.43859649122807
2472690,4,B000CRR50Y,"I have been watching this series on dish and bought the first season because I absolutely fell in love with it.  I am completely upset to find out it was canceled.  This show had potential.  These shows and movies that the States produce are not as steamy and daring as this show was and like one of the reviewers said, it made Buffy the Vampire Slayer look cute at times.

I am hoping to get the second season on discs.  I have most of them recorded from watching them on TV.  But to own them would be so much better.  I will miss this show, so I guess I'll have to find something else to entertain me on Sunday nights.  Oh well.

Hurry US and get season two on DVD.",1264291200,4,667,4.069230769230769
2472691,5,B000CRR50Y,i LOVE this series! just one thought...when is it going to be released for the U.S.? there are MANY fans here who own the 1st season & are STILL waiting for the 2nd season to be released that is encoded for the U.S.!!! 'nuff said!!!,1259366400,40,232,4.177777777777778
2472692,5,B000CRR50Y,"Happy with video, and avail. of region 2 here in the states, have an all region player and like alot of the series offered in region 2 only-this store solved my problem. Thanks",1252886400,,176,4.363636363636363
2472693,1,B000CRR50Y,"I watched seasons 1 and 2 on TV and fell in love with this show. I rushed out to buy the first season, assuming the second season would be available later... here I sit, still awaiting the second season's arrival. It is my feeling that all of us who purchased the first season and cannot get the second season (unless they have a region 2 DVD player...) should be fully reimbursed for the first season if we will never get the second season here in the states. To have only season 1 available is just a tease to those who love the show. Anyone else who feels the same should let the distributors of this show know! I wouldn't buy a candy bar knowing I could only eat half of it...",1247702400,8,680,4.198473282442748
2472694,2,B000CRR50Y,"The Second Season of Hex was a great disappointment to this viewer.  I really liked the first series and was looking forward to the next.  By the fourth episode, I lost all hope of it getting any better.

A demon hunter is introduced in this season and becomes the main focus.  In fact, most of the secondary characters now move center stage and not even the evil spawn taking over the school can save the dullness.  I had to force myself to keep watching in spots - NEVER a good sign.

Season Two is almost a stand alone series with little in common with the great First Season.  Not even having Thelma stick around can save it.  Maybe this was due to having the extremely loyal Thelma (we are talking friendship to the death kind of loyality) switch alliances.

Maybe the first series set up a higher expectation that this series just did not meet.  Or maybe, it was just the unbelievably crappy ending.",1217462400,8,905,4.463414634146342
2472695,4,B000CRR50Y,"The second season of this great British series about a young supernaturally-endowed girl, her dead lesbian BFF, and her seduction by Evil Incarnate is naturally must-see material for fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hex-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000OIOOVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hex - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supernatural/dp/B000RGX0LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supernatural</a>-themed shows in general; and for a while it delivers.  Big time.  And then, as the climax appraoaches it all goes horribly wrong.  But more on that later.

""Hex"" was a very original creation with a lot of adult material that would not fly on stateside television.  This show often makes the purported edginess of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-The-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;look downright cute at times.  The actresses are too sexy for this world, the character-development is outstanding, the story is killer, and the stong supernatural aspects are integrated very well but never overdone.  Initially, Season Two's best aspect is the arrival of The Annointed One, a firey redhead named Ella who shocks Thelma (the impossibly charming lesbian ghost) by responding to her lewd remark when normally only the protagonist (Cassie) and the demonic Azazeal can see/hear her.  Great moment.  Ella's arrival signals a complete series overhaul, one so bold that it puts to shame supposedly earth-shaking events of other series.  I was dumbstruck and in complete disbelief that any television show would attempt such a coup.  Great, great television.  I can't really get into the plot without Season One spoilers,  but I'll just say that Ella's very existence is only to stop the Apocalypse from going down.  Azazeal proved too cunning a foe so now she turns her attention to his son Malachi, the Antichrist who we met at the end of the first season as a wee baby.  Well, he grew up fast and begins his eventual world domination by taking the campus by storm.

Azazeal, the consumate smooth bad guy, makes his exit at this point which damages this show to no end.  Malachi (like most of the guys in ""Hex"") comes off as a tool and just isn't as threatening or charismatic as his pa. A stupendously unlikely/unbelievable romance creates strike two and throws the story into even more turmoil, leaving poor little Thelma to shoulder the burden of keeping ""Hex"" entertaining.  And she does...until Ella pulls the single most boneheaded move in television history and essentially destroys her afterlife, making the audience forget why exactly we liked The Annointed One in the first place.  Oh, right: bada$z wiccan warrior woman with sexy red hair and a talent for demon-slaying.  Still, you will have no love for her by the end of the show and it's ridiculous to think a centuries-old immortal soldier could be so clueless, romantically or otherwise. An impromptu kendo match (British schools are SO cool!) against one of Malachi's handlers and a battle with a demonic pixie-nurse are among Ella's great moments, but her actions over the last several episodes put her high up on the list of most incompetent heroines ever and leave a bad taste that will never be washed away -there is no third season.  Political wrangling between angels and demons was a great concept but when angels start making forceful sexual advances on the world's supposed savior then one has to rethink the definition of the word ""angel"" and the very concept of good and evil.  The problem with that is that this was a short series -19 episodes over two seasons- and there just wasn't time to flesh these concepts out...or in this case even give them more than lip-service.  That simply makes them an annoyance.  Strike three.  But I just can't bring myself to say that ""Hex"" struck out. I still love this show.

I suspect that the show's impending cancellation led to bad scripts and hasty storytelling because the first dozen or so episodes were an amazing narrative full of conflicted but charming characters, edgy humor, stylish supernatural coolness, and some amazing twists and turns.  Then it all just went to hell as if on cue.  Season Two should have been a no-brainer 5-star piece of pure supernatural awesomeness. Season One was a bried-but-encouraging jumping off point and the story just got better during this season until the other shoe fell.

As it stands, however, ""Hex"" only retains it's ""awesome"" status up to a point and then becomes borderline unwatchable as it nears the finish line.  That is a damn shame because this was a brilliant series that really deserved better.  I'm giving this a tenuous 3 1/2 stars and rounding up out of a spirit of generosity for a show that I have a soft spot for and that I feel other fans of supernaural television that pushes the envelope NEED to check out.  It's still a great show, but I just wish it had been handed better; it could have been a Buffy-killer.  Enjoy, but prepare for heartbreak.",1212796800,26,5157,5.374378109452737

8101683,5,B000CRR50Y,"I started watching this series from Netflix - but they only have the first season on DVD. So I ordered this second season. Come to find out the first four episodes were part of the first season set I previous watched. No big deal, I just hadn't known that they were actually part of the second season. The rest of the episodes are what I wanted to see. There are 5 DVDs in this set.

The series isn't bad - it just takes a really long time to get going. Anyway, I won't spoil anything and talk about the story.

These are region 2 DVD (PAL) which means they will not play in a regular US DVD player - I have one of the all region players and they worked fine for me. I'm happy with my purchase.",1428364800,2,694,4.021739130434782
