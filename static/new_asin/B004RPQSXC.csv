4461019,5,B004RPQSXC,"An unforgettable performance by LOLA ALBRIGHT. The only other time that this gorgeous, talented actress was cast properly was as Edy in PETER GUNN. Oops! I forgot she was also superb as Tuesday Weld's mother in LORD LOVE A DUCK...OH! and JOY HOUSE...",1341273600,4,250,4.837209302325581
4461020,4,B004RPQSXC,"I'd never heard of ""A Cold Wind in August"" until this release on DVD-R by MGM/UA Limited Edition and I followed film quite diligently in the mid-sixties.  This one originally dates to 1960 and is the first directorial effort by Alexander Singer who would follow this with ""Psyche 59"" in 1964 and followed it with a real career killer, the cliche-ridden Lana Turner opus in 1965 ""Love Has Many Faces"" (great title!) wherein she played an aging jet setter who marries an aging beach boy (Cliff Robertson) and mixes with a number of aging beach boys and company (Hugh O'Brien, et al.) too over-the-hill to be believable even though Lana was never asked of that question.  She just piled on the drama.  The highlight of the film was when Turner is gored by a bull.  The dialogue was equally laughable.  But ""Psyche 59"" and especially ""A Cold Wind in August"" are rewarding.  Lola Albright and Scott Marlowe make a good team even though the film looks somewhat drained of life, but their romance is quite winning in our sympathies even though most of us come to learn this type of thing, a mature woman with an underage boy generally doesn't work out.  The fact that it does today in some cases makes a case for MGM/UA to release this film again to admirable results.  ""Psyche 59"" had a ethereal quality about it.  In this one, you can marvel at the electricity between the characters and be satisfied even though you can imagine what Hollywood would have done with the story today.  It can be generally attributed to taste as the film could have very easily played up the exploitation angle and perhaps not gone equally unnoticed.  Written by Burton Wohl based on his own novel and photographed by the great Floyd Crosby; music by Gerald Fried.  Recommended.",1304640000,14,1753,4.6742671009771986
4461021,4,B004RPQSXC,"(A COLD WIND IN AUGUST -1961- B+W, widescreen) - Filmed shortly after the cancellation of TV's popular and ground-breaking gangster noir-ish 'Peter Gunn', co-star Lola Albright ('Joy House', 'Lord Love a Duck', 'The Monolith Monster') shines as a stripper and former prostitute who seduces and ultimately falls for an impressionable working-class seventeen year-old boy who happens to be the building superintendent's son, who comes to fix her sink pipe and sticks around to check out the rest of her plumbing. They tumble hot and heavy for each other, acting out their romance in full public view, which was only mildly shocking to some back in those days (today, it's mandatory jail time and sexual predator status for the rest of your life along with a social pariah tag and unemployable character listing on your resume, but back then it was simply ""robbing the cradle"" and warranted  mere gossip from the neighborhood jealous fat moms in housecoats and hair rollers - I ain't sayin' it's right, I'm just sayin'). Boy, we've come a long way, but I'm not certain I'd call it 'progress'. (When I was a kid, almost every boy in my school and on my block had a crush on an older woman somewhere - a teacher, a housewife, a friends mom, a department store saleswoman - but it wasn't considered 'criminal behavior' whether you were the subject or the subjectee. It's a double-standard, I know, because I think men who lust after young girls are creepy degenerates...). I'm certain this is the reason why this flick has never seen daylight before this limited MGM release.

Scott Marlowe is competent as the 17 year-old who hangs around with his buds and girlfriends in alleyways and streets of what appears to be New York City, and has a great relationship with his father, who knows of his affair with 'the Madonna', as he refers to her, and never tries to discourage the relationship, he sees it as part of growing up, and the absence of a mother is probably one of the reasons, or so we're kinda led to believe. But Lola has a sleazeball ex, a sugar daddy in the form of Herschel Bernardi (also of 'Peter Gunn' fame), and a serious drinking problem, so things get complicated rather quickly. She isn't a bad person, she does favors for other women in the building, she's rather pitiable in fact - to help her ex from getting knee-capped by the mob, she agrees to go back to stripping for a week at a downtown dive, and don't you know Scott's friends decide to go to the joint to see the fresh meat and quickly report back to Scott, who's reluctant to believe them. Well, seeing is believing, and after he witnesses the stage show, is understandably crushed. Now he puts two and two together and realizes that Bernardi is more than a 'friend', and feels like a fool. Youth has a way of recovering quickly however, and before you know it, Scott is back with his own age group and a local girl, and poor Lola is forever forlorn. Such is life in the cruel daylight hours of the Naked City in this part cautionary tale, part True Romance saga, and part sexploitation timepiece from director Alexander Singer.

Lola Albright is superb in the role; it's only 80 minutes long and flies by, so it must have something going for it. It's tawdry, enjoyable trash, if nothing else. If it had nudity, it would be one of the best 'Something Weird Video' nudie film classics from the 60's. For what it was, I enjoyed it, but I like Lola, the rest of you will have to decide for yourself based on these disclosures. 'A Cold Wind In August' has some torrid steamy moments...",1302998400,29,3557,4.61611374407583

4461025,5,B004RPQSXC,I love black & white movies and this was no different. I was caught up the story immediately! The guy looked a little older than the 17 years he was supposed to be but I believed his character. I loved the burlesque references & I was glued to the screen til the abrupt ending! The story itself made me a little uncomfortable considering how young the male character was but it was lots of fun to watch.,1453680000,2,403,4.246753246753247

4461027,5,B004RPQSXC,This was pretty unexpected in terms of the depth and detail of the relationship between the teen boy and older woman. The description says she is a stripper and prostitute but I did not see any prostitution. She was trying to get out of the stripping scene but got pushed into a local show where her young man sees her act and flips. She is clearly damaged from her life experiences but wants a normal life. I had a hard time believing that the boy could so easily walk away from her at the end to go play stick ball.  The rest was well done.,1447977600,3,542,4.161904761904762
