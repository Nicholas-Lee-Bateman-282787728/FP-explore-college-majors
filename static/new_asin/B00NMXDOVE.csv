8679265,5,B00NMXDOVE,"This is a fun, quirky, colorful little movie!  Fans of Zosia Mamet (who plays Shoshana on HBO TV series ""Girls"") will be delighted by her fast talking/witty character here as well.  Jee Young Han is sassy and fun. Paul Iacono does and great job - I don't know how he kept a straight face through most of the film, where his character is in absolutely ridiculous circumstances constantly.  Awesome to see Jaleel White here (TV child star who played Urkel in ""Full House"") - his character has some deep nuggets of wisdom amidst alot of nonsense. A really fun story about friendship, fantasy, and NOT growing up.  Surprisingly good little rap music bit by Zosia and Jee.  One of the best things about this movie is that the set where most of the film takes place - the apartment of Z and G - is so colorful and fun.  I watched it a second time just to pause and get a good look at all the funny little details of the set. Then I watched it a bunch more times just because it's awesome.  Can't wait to see what is coming up for Zosia Mamet's career. We need to see more of her.  And we need more quirky little movies like this!",1467331200,,1123,4.264150943396227

There were so many parts of this movie that I could barely contain myself during because I was laughing so hard. It was brilliant and well worth the watch. Highly recommend.",1415577600,2,269,4.510204081632653
