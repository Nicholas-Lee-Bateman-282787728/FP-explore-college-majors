7833095,5,6302969638,I love this version of the Scarlet Pimpernel.  David Niven does a wonderful job in this more rousing adventure version.  HIs disguises are a hoot.  Worth getting in any collection.,1472342400,,180,4.933333333333334
7833096,4,6302969638,"PLOT: DAVID NIVEN as Sir Percy and in COLOUR in this fun addition to the Pimpernel TALES~

this one STARTS fun~ the guards at the GATES of Paris are busy letting an old hag go through and then followed by Soliders who are CHASING the HAG~ yet another clever ESCAPE by the PIMPERNEL and his gang~ and then they help and entire~ ""FRENCH Aristo Family"" in a lovely Chateau  surrounded by the blood thirsty french MOB~ The Pimpernel and his BAND ~ sneak them right through the mob in a huge WINE cask~  now back to Jolly old England~Sir Percy very dandish DAVID NIVEN is the toast and fop of English Society. this one starts slow and builds FAST~!  We see the most celebrated couple are at ""odds"" as Lady Blakney (lovely) Margaret Leighton who through BLACK MAIL helps pass on to Chauvlin the CLUE to the scarlet pimpernel at the BALL~ David Nivin shines in this one AS HE PLAYS THE ""DULL SIR PERCY""... ""french"" HOW CAN THEY TEACH EVEN THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO SPEAK IT?"" has you laughing out loud~ his costume as the ONE legged man to get into the French embassy to get the Letter to clear Armond (Lady Blankey's brother Armond) is first rate~ now a horse race is the BET with the price Regent (JACK HAWKINS) to get Percy over to FRANCE to rescue yet more ""aristos"" from the French Tribunal but now Chauvlin KNOWS his identity~ and Lady Blakney as she finds out the Pimpernels~ ""hidden"" identity from the RING ...NOW.... ALL roads lead to FRANCE~ ~ the ""FOCUS"" IN this one ARE costumes and characters by Niven who is most HOMELY as the old woman and handsome as Sir Percy~ Margaret Leighton is beautiful and ""tragic"" and a VERY SAD Margarite~ the final escape at St. Michael Monistary is excellent. this has NEVER been released on DVD and the VHS copies are hard to find. this version has both HUMOR and some very good acting by Niven who gives it his all to rescue the Aristos. I GIVE THIS 4 OUT OF 5 for acting, CASTING, *** excellent *** English Country Side and COSTUMES. THIS TAKES THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL AND THE ELUSIVE PIMPERNEL IN THE PLOT FROM BOTH BOOKS~ the ONLY negative thing I can say about this one is Leighton is beautiful BUT IS AN ""overly""... TRAGIC Margarite~ but IS the ONLY flame haired ""MARGARITE"" described by Orczy in all the books~and Chauvlin is Cyril Cusack~ who has the sneaky mean looks down perfect~

ALSO SEE THE **RETURN OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL ** WITH BARRY BARNES AND SOPHIE STEWART* ANOTHER FUN PIMPERNEL ADVENTURE.

filmed in England and not relased in the USA for over a year~ maybe someday they will release this on DVD~ HINT HINT HINT~!~~",1330214400,3,2572,4.508583690987124
7833097,2,6302969638,"If I hadn't already read the book and watched the movie version with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews, this would have been a hard movie to follow.  David Niven does a great job acting for the time period it was filmed (1950) but the VHS is blurry and the audio is not great.

Best off to buy the VHS or DVD version of ""The Scarlett Pimpernel"" with Jane Seymour.  It is most entertaining and I never get tired of it.",1127174400,3,416,4.175
7833098,4,6302969638,"This great movie captures the spirit of the book--with several improvements on the original too. David Niven gives a wonderful portrayal of Sir Percy Blakeney(bart.) Although the film was made a long time ago,  the characters' refreshing sincerity comes through.
The film starts off  in the typical ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" method--France, Mme. la  Guillontine, the old hag, a thrilling carriage chase--but as it progresses,  it starts to take on a familiar, yet refresshingly unique look.
My  favourite part is when--. Sorry, I really musn't spoil the movie.
""The Elusive Pimpernel"" is available now. Watch this movie and  you will come to love it as much as I do.",919814400,17,660,5.121495327102804
