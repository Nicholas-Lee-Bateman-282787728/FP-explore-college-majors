8488632,5,B005XGVF82,"This is perhaps in my opinion one of the very best railroad videos displaying the abilities of the C630's in fabulous scenery, and it is by far one of the best videos showing the hardworking men and women in Canadian railroading. Lots of good segments of car handling in quaint Canadian communities that rely on the railroad for service and it shows the skills of the engineers and conductors doing their dangerous jobs. Just a great video for any train buff or model railroader. Would make a good gift.",1382745600,,503,4.662921348314606
