8031628,5,B0002T71GK,"Disney pales compared to these feisty, imaginative, delightful perversions of various musical classics.  The action flows from the music, not vice versa...  High Note would be a perfect way to teach kids to read music.  No one is safe from satire here.  Liszt, Rossini, Strauss.  The director is a genius.  Such detail..like Bugs ears gently moving in rhythm as he plays the Hungarian Rapsody.",1432598400,2,393,5.0625
8031629,5,B0002T71GK,"My life has been altered for the better.  My grandkids LOVE these cartoons with the great music. I constantly hear requests for Grandpa's cartoons and Grandpa's music (rock n roll). Also, my wife loves me even more (after 41 years).  She is an elementary music teacher and is overjoyed by including the 'classical' stuff with cartoons. Happy wife...happy life.  It's a win-win in my house.",1358726400,4,389,4.953846153846154
