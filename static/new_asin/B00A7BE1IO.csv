8547745,2,B00A7BE1IO,"I will never understand these DVDs that just have a person sitting there with a boring, slow, monotone voice-over playing while the person in the video just does the positions and moves. I honestly couldn't get past the first part of her just lying on the floor. I guess I want to feel more connected to the person I'm watching. Personally I found the Atoning Yoga DVDs with Sarah Sutton much better. She reads you a Scripture and then leads you through the class herself. Maybe I'm just nitpicky but I figure it's my workout so it should be something I like.",1450137600,,559,4.490196078431373
