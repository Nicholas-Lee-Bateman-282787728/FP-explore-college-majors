5817840,4,B00DI0135K,"Chris Potamitis (Liam Hemsworth) has always wanted to be a cop, but as is the case with most recent graduates, he's on a waiting list, so he takes a job as an armored truck guard. Almost as soon as he starts working there, Chris is scared by the amount of money and the lack of security at the place he's working, and stupidly mentions that fact to his best friend, Eddie (Michael Angarano). Eddie immediately plans and executes a robbery, which both the police and Chris's mobbed up bosses thinks he's involved in. Now his life is endangered on three separate fronts and he's not sure where to turn. Empire State is a tremendous thriller based on a true story, written and directed by Dito Montiel, and if you don't know the name, you should. Montiel made a stunning debut, telling his life story in the film, A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints, in 2006 (On of our Must See Movies). Montiel's career has been all up hill from there. He grew up on the streets of Brooklyn, and all his films are based on real life stories from the neighborhood, that were forgotten a long time ago. With Montiel films you're always guaranteed a few things, a well written story, a tremendous cast, lots of action, and lots of eye candy, and Empire State does not disappoint. This film has everything from the insider angle, to the mob, inside the police investigation, and of course Liam Hemsworth at the center of it all. Big brother Chris may get all the recognition in Hollywood, for being the all-mighty Thor, but baby brother Liam, really does get better and better in every film I see him in. Empire State has a little bit of everything, it is well written, and comes at you from so many different angles. This film was so much fun to watch, it's the kind of thing you want to see more than once, and it's streaming so if you're not doing anything right now, go check it out!",1468454400,,1864,4.453216374269005
5817841,3,B00DI0135K,"truly meh

love the rock, chris/liam whichever hemsworth is not a cute as normal - or maybe there's a difference between them I haven't noticed. This was just a total meh. It's ok at best. Surprising that this caliber of star power was willing to do this film. Could have been so much more.

Disappointing. Star power brings it up from a 1.5 to a 2.7 which rounds to 3 stars. Make no mistake, this is NOT even a 3 star movie. It rounds up.

You can even see cake make up on the Rock at one point. Yikes. I would expect that until he's in his 70s - when hiding it will be difficult. No eye candy. Plot/dialog may be based on true story but could have been done better. It's as though the writer/producer/director/film studio owed a greek a favor and so they ""collaborated"" to put out a terrible movie. I'd use a worse word, but amazon would block the review....",1467331200,,860,4.263803680981595

5817872,2,B00DI0135K,"Let me set the scene for you: the Rock and his cop partner are time travelers from the year 2015. You can tell by the way they dress like they just walked out of a Planet Fitness on their way to a Chipotle. They go back in time to the early 80s or late 70s and meet up with a tall blonde Greek teenager who has the charisma of a red apple and a best friend who is the most annoying person on planet earth. Some things happen, a dog gets shot, a turtle gets shot in the cheek, a guy gets shot in the mouth - and then there are about seven characters who appear and then never show their face again. There is a scene in the end where everyone is pointing guns and cussing at each other. And then the Rock, dressed like he just walked into a Coscto naked and walked out wearing the biggest mom jeans they had, saves the day. He must have had a clause in his contract that said ""I will never dress in character, especially if it's supposed to be the 70s. I will only be costumed as the actual character that I am in real life, which is The Rock, a big man who wears even bigger cheap jeans.""

Set in 1982 New York City, Empire State is a crime drama based on a true story about Chris Potamitis (Liam Hemsworth), a newly-employed security guard for an armored truck company. Chris gets involved with a cash heist when he unwisely tells his childhood friend Eddie (Michael Angarano) about the companys ineffective security system.

Frankly, I don't know why this story had to be made into a film. The heist itself is not very unique. The description of the Greek American community the heros family belongs to is perfunctory. Empire State struggles to be both a thriller and a drama, but either way the film fails to interest us, except several scenes that elicit the feel of run-down 1980s New York City.",1396051200,3,968,4.688235294117647

After seeing this film, I think it should've been titled How Not to Plan a Robbery or If It Can Go Wrong, It Will. This had to be the most inept and inadvertent heist in the history of crime.  From beginning to end, it was nothing but a mistake, presaging complete failure, with the main character planning the thing then backing out but still being so gutless he can't say ""Ni"" when his friend decides to go ahead without him. As far as the characters are concerned, everyone who got shot didn't get it soon enough and I kept wishing the so-called ""best friend"" would get his just so someone would shut him up. This was a very uncomfortable film to watch, lots of yelling and violence and repetitious dialogue.  I just kept waiting for the ax to fall since even the main character who  is relatively innocent, just wasn't innocent enough. To have the real Chis shown at the end of the film was a let down after viewing Liam Hemsworth portraying him in the film. Entertaining in a way, more of an example of what not to do if you're going to rob something....and yet, it has some appeal because of the actors' abilities in the parts.",1389398400,,1341,4.417004048582996

The dialogue is curse word filled mostly with little else, miscast with annoying characters (particularly Eddie, who does a great job at being annoying), and the under-use of Dwayne Johnson. Johnson appears sparingly in this movie and even he can't really save the lack of excitement in this movie.

I am not sure how much Empire State is based on a true story but I hope it was more exciting than how it was presented with not much happening throughout the whole movie.

5818022,3,B00DI0135K,"Liam Hemsworth is simply not proving to be the ""main event"" attraction that film studios are hoping he'd be - at least nowhere the near the heavyweight caliber of his older A-list brother, Chris Hemsworth.  The youngest of the Hemsworth brothers has only been in Hollywood for a few short years, but he is struggling to carry films on his own - and might just be overexposing himself.  He's had notable roles in The Last Song (with his fiance Miley Cyrus), The Hunger Games, and The Expendables 2.  However, like his role in The Expendables 2, he has proved to be just that - expendable.  Since his role in the Stallone-powered action flick, Hemsworth has trickled out two less than entertaining flicks, Love and Honor and Paranoia.  Clearly, Liam Hemsworth is best utilized when he's surrounded by top-name actors, like Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, and Harrison Ford - but does the presence of Dwayne Johnson help his newest attempt at a lead actor in the straight-to-video film, Empire State?

Directed by Dito Montiel (The Son of No One), Empire State stars Liam Hemsworth as Chris Potamis, an armored car security guard that helps plot the biggest heist in United States history (when it originally occurred in 1982).  Chris applies to be a police officer, but is rejected due to having a prior record, forcing him to seek employment with an armored car company.  There, he discovers the company heads don't have an exact count on the millions of dollars in storage, and that they also leave it guarded by minimal security.  Chris, and his friend Eddie (Michael Angarano), decide to make a play for the cash.  At the same time, a detective, James Ransome (Dwayne Johnson) has been watching Chris, trying to figure out his intentions towards his place of employment.  Emma Roberts, Jerry Ferrara, and Michael Rispoli also star in supporting roles.

Empire State loosely follows the events of the 1982 Sentry Armored Car Company robbery, and while the original premise of the story remains, there's definitely a great deal of flare added to this film.  As far as the film goes, it features some interesting qualities and some bothersome qualities.  First, Liam Hemsworth actually thrives in this role - even though the role calls for an Italian, which he is most certainly not.  He tries to do his best Brooklyn accent, impersonating the real life security guard, Christos Potamitis.  Unfortunately, this blond haired Australian is severely out of his element in this New York-based bank heist.  Hemsworth portrays a likeable character, even though it's difficult to fully realize where the character's heart lies.  One minute he's playing Robin Hood by stealing for a family in need and the next he's plotting to steal money for...well, it's never really explained why he's so desperate for money.  Chris Potamitis is essentially a character without rhyme or reason - and that's mainly due to poor scripting, not Liam Hemsworth.

The starring roles in this film are extremely out of whack, with Dwayne Johnson - one of the hottest actors in Hollywood, playing second fiddle to Liam Hemsworth.  The actor, known to the WWE Universe as the Rock, is at a point in his career when he should be second to no one.  He's coming off a heavily hyped main event at Wrestlemania, not to mention a successful first half of 2013 - starring in Snitch, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Pain & Gain, and Fast & Furious 6.  True, he shared starring roles in several of those films - but only because they included Mark Wahlberg and Vin Diesel.  Regardless, Johnson should be the face and selling-point of every film he's in from here on out.  Unfortunately, he is cast in a secondary role in this film, which only briefly allows him to show off his full potential as an actor.  One thing is for sure - he absolutely dominates each and every one of his scenes, rising above the generic dialogue and making the best out of a role that he probably regrets taking in the first place.

For a film that has gone straight to video on-demand (VOD) and direct-to-video, it sure does showcase a more than capable and extremely talented cast.  Emma Roberts is obviously one of the most recognizable names on the roster, but she's only present for a handful of scenes - many of which are pointless.  She's a character that could have easily been written out and it's a crushing blow for her talent to also go by the wayside in this film.  Most scenes - as far as the supporting cast goes - are ""owned"" by the charismatic and overly talkative Michael Angarano.  His portrayal of Eddie, Chris' best friend, is completely buried by Empire States' lack of advertisement.  And, while his role can be horribly annoying at times (which is the point), it's still an impressively acted part that will go largely unrecognized.

Overall, Empire State can be painfully stale at times - even though the cast is quite an enjoyable ensemble.  It's usually a pleasant feature when a film incorporates the real-life newscasts - to help give an authentic, documentary-style feel to it.  Sadly, there's very little authenticity present in this flick and that's just one of several deficiencies that held this feature from hitting the big screen.  This company ""heist"" might have been a big deal at the time, but the crime almost seems tame compared to the films out there these days - you know, the ones with attractive villains skimming billions from corporations.  Anyway, it's hard not to like this film (mostly due to the presence of Dwayne Johnson), yet it pales in comparison to the majority of every other bank heist film that's ever been made.  Still, try to look past this film's shortcomings and give it a whirl.  The film isn't up to the standard of most quality Hollywood releases - and as long as you realize that before viewing, you should find it to be at least as entertaining as a made-for-TV movie.

He lives in a neighborhood of Greeks, along with his loud mouth, foul mouth friend Eddie (Michael Angarano). He is the classic idiot side kick who messes everything up.

Eddie has big dreams for the money that Chris guards and desires to be a big shot, even though no one can stand him. Dwayne Johnson plays the investigating officer and comes in about half way through. His name as well as Emma Roberts are over billed for their roles. The film is based on an actual robbery, and like real crime, it is more akin to ""dumb crook news"" than a master criminal.

The film makes for an entertaining action drama.

Going in I was expecting a heist movie and I am usually a big fan of that genre. For a movie with a cast like this I was really expecting a lot more. I'm not talking about the acting because The Rock and Baby Thor aren't the best around but at least they make action movies entertaining. Thats's where the disappointment sets in. This is just about the least exciting heist movie I have seen. The only thing that really saves it and makes it worth watching is the fact that this is a true story. Hard core fans of The Rock will most likely like this more then me though but be warned that he is a secondary character and Hemsworth really carries the movie.

In general it does a very good job of evoking NYC in the early 1980s, before it all got cleaned up and sanitized, but then it gets loads of little details wrong. Why? Some of the cast, like Michael (I Could Be Dana Carvey's Little Brother) Angarano, fit the period perfectly. Others, like Liam Hemsworth and the Rock, are disastrously miscast and don't fit the time or their characters at-effing-all. The Rock doesn't even try -- he looks and acts entirely like a pumped up movie star in 2013 who was air-lifted into a period movie just to give it some star power, and ruins every scene he's in. Thankfully there aren't many. Anyway, a larger problem is that after a good start the story never really ignites, it just sort fizzles along from one predictable moment to the next.
