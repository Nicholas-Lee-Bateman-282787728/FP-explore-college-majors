3986216,1,B002TVQ4CG,I was dissapointed to find that In Hell was not on any of the disc. I thought I was getting three movies but don't know what happened?,1358553600,,134,4.0
3986217,4,B002TVQ4CG,Great for the Van Damme lovers as well as enjoyment for those who like action movies. Nice variety plot wise.,1358294400,,109,4.5
3986218,5,B002TVQ4CG,"I was hesitant to purchase this at first because Amazon has all of three of the movies in this set listed as ""Full Screen"".  I found this odd because In Hell was strictly ""Wide Screen"" in it's original stand alone release.  These compilation packs are 'almost' always re-branded re-releases of the stand alone versions, not to mention two of these movies are now out of print as far as I can tell, so I took a gamble... And I'm glad I did!

Derailed is on a labeled disc by itself.  It's bare bones with just the movie and scene selection.  It is the ""Full Screen"" version.

The second disc contains In Hell on one side and Wake of Death on the other.

In Hell contains a scene selection and a ""Making of Featurette"".  It is the beautiful original ""Wide Screen"" version!  Looks and sounds great!

Wake of Death includes a scene selection, ""Making of Featurette"" and the original trailer.  The film itself is a ""Non Animorphic Wide Screen"" transfer.  It is ""Wide Screen"" but is formatted for a Full Screen TV.  If you watch it on a Wide Screen set then it will still be ""Wide Screen"" but the picture will not fill the screen entirely and there will be black bars at the sides as well as the top and bottom.  The picture looks excellent regardless of the odd Wide Screen transfer.",1271376000,16,1278,4.429184549356223
3986219,2,B002TVQ4CG,"Wake of Death and In Hell, should have been released in theaters in the U.S. Wake of Death played theaters in Europe and was a hit. In the U.S. they both could have been Van Damm's comeback films. Derailed- stinks. If your a film junkie, do not buy this triple feature. All 3 films are full screen. You really only need Wake Of Death and In Hell. I purchased both from Amazon marketplace sellers and got them cheaper than the cost  of this set. In fact Wake Of Death was the best $3.00 movie I ever purchased. (.01 cent plus 2.99 for shipping) Whats funny, I am not a fan of JCVD, I just kept reading great reviews on both films and the fact that Ringo Lam and Simon Yam where involved (One of my favorite HK directors and I am a fan of Simon Yam)in the making of each film.",1267488000,8,774,4.125827814569536

3986228,4,B002TVQ4CG,These 3 are not the best but are still loaded with action. The fight scenes are very good. Great DVD,1396396800,,100,4.05
3986229,5,B002TVQ4CG,"A 3 movie value pack that gets adrenaline pumping. Van Damme doesn't disappoint. High octane action times 3. Some of Van Damme's lesser known films, but definitely worth adding to a collection for any fan of beat 'em up action films.",1396224000,,233,4.7073170731707314
3986230,5,B002TVQ4CG,"Derailed is pretty awful, Wake of Death is, according to the internet, one of JCVD's best modern movies, but i personally wasn't all that impressed, but In Hell is definitely one of his better movies",1393372800,,199,4.714285714285714

JEAN CLAUDE CAN ACT WELL - SHOULD GET MORE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BIGGER BUDGETS AND GO TO THE BIG SCREEN.",1374796800,,122,4.3478260869565215
3986235,5,B002TVQ4CG,"Great!. The DVD multi-packs are a great idea. I loved it. There were those (movies) that I would like to fine by Van Damme in multi-packs but they weren't, available. Please offer more combinations of movies.",1371772800,,208,4.805555555555555
3986236,4,B002TVQ4CG,"My husband is a huge Van Damme fan.  When I saw this triple feature one, I had to get it for him.  He hadn't seen any of them before and said they were all pretty good.  He was happy with them.  I watched them with him and they weren't too bad.  So I would recommend them to Van Damme fans out there, or even folks who like action movies.",1364860800,2,338,3.8405797101449277
3986237,5,B002TVQ4CG,"Jean-Claude Van Damme at his top martial arts form.  The fighting scenes were exciting to watch.  It takes him awhile to get mad to really get going, but once he does look out bad guys.  This DVD was a steal.  If you are looking for action than this is the one.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1361664000,,305,3.9344262295081966
3986238,4,B002TVQ4CG,"Derailed-No stars! Everything in this movie really is horrible! Fights, story, music, editing, effects, etc. Do not watch this one!
Wake of death-3 1/2 stars! Now this is more like it! The story telling can be a little sloppy at times but for a low budget movie this one caught me off guard. Decent Action, great acting by Van Damme! He is so much more interesting as a dark or broken character. And 100 times better than Derailed! LOL
In Hell-3 1/2 stars! Another good straight to video film for Damme! Decent fights and good performance by Damme! I thought
it was interesting that Damme was not a fighter but a regular guy turned into an animal. Alot better than the cheesy Death Warrant film!

So in my opinion these are two of his best straight to video films, buy if your a fan and stay away from Derailed! LOL",1360540800,4,815,4.433333333333334
