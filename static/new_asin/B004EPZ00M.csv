4349877,5,B004EPZ00M,"I went to watch this wonderful movie in the theater with my friends and I was amazed at how wonderful it was. I also watched the first one when it came out in 2003 it was also funny and awesome. Rowan Atkinson is one great actor that I admire. I have watched the first one 87 times and the second one 3 times already. Both of them have great story lines, amazing actors and yet a relativly low budget. All the action is mindblowing and in Johnny  English Reborn, you would never know what was going to happen in the end on your first time watching it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes watching movies between the ages of 2 and 94!!! TOTALLY 10/10",1329696000,,656,4.2063492063492065
4349878,5,B004EPZ00M,"This movie is a well written, action packed, dimwitted flick with the characteristic Johnny English intelligence (literally.)  His adventures and misadventures alike will leave you chuckling throughout the whole movie.  But beware, you have to like the persona of Johnny English if you want to enjoy this movie, otherwise you will just think it is stupid.",1329177600,11,355,5.321428571428571
4349879,3,B004EPZ00M,"Johnny English, Britain's (or perhaps the world's) most incompetent spy comes back in ""Johnny English Reborn,"" a sequel slightly better than the original made in 2003. This time the sequel has more action and on-location scenes (partly in Hong Kong and France), but its jokes largely remain the same - well-executed and sporadically funny, but predictable and nothing original.

""Johnny English Reborn"" opens with Rowan Atkinson's bumbling MI7 agent training and mediating at the Tibetan monastery, who was dismissed from the organization because of the fiasco in Mozambique. However, the disgraced agent is called back to mission again by the agency in order to stop the plot to assassinate the Premier of China. Gillian Anderson plays Pamela Thornton, his immediate superior. Rosamund Pike (""Die Another Day"") is Kate Sumner, an MI7 psychoanalyst and Johnny's love interest.

""Johnny English Reborn"" sends up some scenes and conventions of the spy genre including James Bond films; the golf scene reminds us of ""Goldfinger"" and the climactic snowmobile scene, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."". But the film is mainly about Rowan Atkinson's character and his physical gags, some of which are funny (like a wheelchair chase), but nothing creative and brilliant compared with his earlier works.

Supporting players include Dominic West as Simon Ambrose, a capable agent Johnny respects, and Daniel Kaluuya as Johnny's partner, but not Ben Miller, who was effectively cast as Johnny's sidekick in the original.

As a whole ""Johnny English Reborn"" lives up to its name as far as the action of the film goes, but its comedy leaves much to be desired.",1327449600,3,1648,5.254752851711027
4349880,4,B004EPZ00M,"If you just want to sit there and laugh your head off, this is the movie. And, all of the jokes are very original, you don't see them coming. The people in the theater were laughing out loud. Think of a more modern Inspector Clouseau.",1321142400,5,234,4.222222222222222
4349881,4,B004EPZ00M,"I saw this in the theater twice and laughed out loud both times. There is one crouch joke in the beginning, otherwise it is a clean, action packed, fun movie for the family.  I don't remember the first movie, but I  do remember I thought it was stupid. This is better.",1320969600,3,268,4.235294117647059
4349882,5,B004EPZ00M,Rowan Atkinson shows once again why he is widely considered to be one of the top living comics. In lesser hands this film would not have been worth the price of admission. It took me back to the glory days of Peter Sellers and the inimitable Inspector Clouseau. Atkinson is also supported by a strong supporting cast including Gillian Anderson and the very lovely Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day). I can actually remember some James Bond films that I didn't find as entertaining as this movie is. I don't know why it took eight years to get this sequel. I would not mind another outing for Johnny English if it is as much fun as this one. Be sure to watch the end credits for one last scene!!,1318204800,27,691,4.40625
4349883,5,B004EPZ00M,"Johnny English has been 5 years in retirement in Tibet learning the ways of the master. He is called out of retirement for a mission to China to hunt down ""Vortex"" an assassination group out to kill the Chinese premier. There are 3 keys, or key parts that must be gathered together to have access to a secret weapon.

The first good joke was the ""Toshiba"" sponsor sign for MI-7 secret services. The humor is more than just slapstick. Rowan Atkinson combines the sophistication and intellect of James Bond with the zaniness of Peter Sellers. Indeed, for those who loved Peter Sellers would also enjoy Atkinson who doesn't attempt to copy Sellers, but rather create a character in his own style reminiscent of the master. The early scene with the cat had me laughing out loud at the classic style of Atkinson.

English is aided by agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya), a sidekick that has his own failings. Excellent use of the sound track. Worth seeing. Simply hilarious.

Good family movie for the older kids. Imagine a good comedy without all that crude humor (okay it has some kicks to the groin). No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1317686400,47,1120,4.704081632653061

I don't think I found anything at all funny here, except for Gillian Anderson's ludicrous fake British accent (and maybe it's just me, but she always seems so incomplete as an actress without David Duchovney.)

4350374,5,B004EPZ00M,"Fascinating. I was not a Rowan Atkinson fan until watching Johnny English, and now I want to find out as much about the fellow as I can look up. I had seen the heart-warming Mr. Bean movies and knew they were patterned after another set of mime-character films starring a French actor known for his comedic genius, made some years ago. The Bean movies reminded me of Pee Wee Herman's Adventure, and I put Atkinson in the same category as the star of those films, and held my opinions to myself, neutral.
But after watching this very accomplished actor play the part of a smooth secret agent with a flair for doing funny stuff, I can recommend that any people out there who are Bond addicts, LISTEN UP, because you will thoroughly enjoy Johnny English, and Johnny English Reborn.
The beautiful women, fast cars, clever plots, admirable villains, elegant backdrops of exclusive European destinations are all here in sufficient abundance to satisfy, and the smooth Johnny English delivers a better product than most of the actors playing serious secret agent roles.
It's the most good clean fun that you'll get from a theater experience than any movie on the market, bar none, and will keep you glued to your seat from the explosive starts to the hilarious endings. Mind you, don't make the mistake of thinking this film is a low level B-movie production. It is the slickest produced spy movie that I have seen in years, and I am an official James Bond geek..",1475971200,,1456,4.713725490196079

He is a gifted comedian who makes burlesque slapstick just as funny today as it was in the 1920's. His situations are made all the more absurd by his apparent nonchalance and chameleon-like adaptability to any circumstance.

My wife and I have now seen this show three times and will probably see it that many more and laugh at each gag as if we had never seen it even once. People who have worked with Atkinson claim that he is a tireless perfectionist who can wear out a director, crew and the rest of the cast in his efforts to do something exactly right. Well, if that's his major flaw, we the audience are the beneficiaries!",1421625600,,714,4.409090909090909

4351198,3,B004EPZ00M,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Atkinson's masterfully cringe-worthy portrayal of the incompetent & accident prone wannabe spy in the first film, we just had to get another fix of his unique brand of humour when this second film came along.

Is this film as funny as the first one? No, I don't think it is; it is funny but it is also just a little too slick. There are some superb comedic moments where Atkinson's immaculate timing and expressiveness really shine, but the bumbling fool of the first film has disappeared to be replaced by a less obviously funny, more suave & sophisticated English. There is no sign of Bough (except in a special features deleted scene), instead we have a young aspiring trainee for a side-kick and, while that works pretty well, the chemistry between Bough & English was a key to the humour of the first film. Gillian Anderson makes an creditable Pegasus (but without the gravitas of Tim Pigott-Smith's portrayal) and Dominic West is the perfect No. 1, but the absence of a baddie of John Malkovich's calibre leaves a bit of a hole in the plot. This film is funny in a more subtle way (that wouldn't be difficult!) and I think it has tried a little too hard to make a satirical observation on the contrast between the old-school secret service and the modern soft, cuddly & heavily sponsored outsourced government agency.

It is fair enough that a sequel has to be different from the original, otherwise it would just be an un-original rehash of the same theme and in this the film succeeds, but perhaps at the cost of tear-streaming, sides-aching raw humour. It isn't that this isn't a good or funny film, it is, but I don't think it bears comparison with its predecessor.

Its perplexing though, there are several notable actors, a decent budget and Atkinson is clearly a funny man but it just doesnt come together? It is part Mr. Bean, part Maxwell Smart, part Leslie Neilsen and yes, part James Bond. But it only comes part of the way to being any of them and ultimately it is disjointed and unoriginal. A few latter scenes have a good idea underpinning them but the film fails to get you into a laughing mood from the start and they suffer accordingly.

The kids watched it on Netflix, adored it, and asked for the blu-ray for Christmas. They really wanted me and their dad to watch it with them, and while we didn't really want to, we did. We laughed our heads off. This sequel is much, much better than the original Johnny English movie. It's still a juvenile and silly style of comedy, but it really is hilarious.

The original ""Johnny English"" is better, but it's still great to see his character again.

I've seen this movie 4 times now. Rowan Atkinson is IMO an awesome British comedian. Seeing Gillian Anderson in this movie was a treat (I've seen half of the X-File shows and all the movies). Rowan's a Mi7 spy who is nothing compared to 007. Everything Johnny does is by sheer dumb luck. There was quite a bit of Rowan's typical comedy. But my favorite part is during the credits.

4352760,4,B004EPZ00M,"Honestly, I'm shocked.  My son and I laughed quite a bit at the first movie, and still bring it up now and then (usually by simply saying ""flebby""...).  I expected something a little more dumb and silly, something I'd ""tolerate"", but I still couldn't resist it.  I'm so glad that I picked it up!

First the movie is a little different mostly around Johnny English himself.  He's been in Tibet training with Monks to become more in control of himself - but it's still Johnny English so he's pretty easily distracted and silly.  My favorite scene in the entire movie is a chase scene that I relate to the old ""Pepe Le Pew"" cartoons, the guy is jumping around, over fences, between buildings - but Johnny is using his training to remain wise and follow him through more conventional means (instead of scaling down the building the way the guy that he's following is doing, he simply takes the elevator).  I laughed out loud at every turn, much to my surprise.

There's another long chase scene where Johnny is in a special wheelchair that can go 60MPH.  If you watch the extras, you'll see that this thing was for real and not all of the high speed parts were done with a stunt double!

Last - watch the credits!  There is an AWESOME scene that they cut from the movie to add to the credits, and they did a great job with it.  He's cooking and cutting items to the sound of music, and Rowan Atkinson's perfect comedic timing shines through in this scene - it's a must watch!

Honestly, if you enjoy this type of humor or especially if you saw the first one and liked it, do yourself a favor and get this movie.  Now that I own it I know I'll be re-watching it now and then when I need a good, silly laugh.

All the while, Atkinson is showing off his comedic talents, but in this case as a spy who just has bad luck, not a total incompetent. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",1353801600,,438,4.4875
4353045,3,B004EPZ00M,"For the first half hour or so Johnny English Reborn is a surprisingly funny spy spoof that's a huge improvement on the dire first big screen outing for Rowan Atkinson's hopeless yet supremely self-confident spy who was originally dreamt up for a series of credit card adverts and seemed ill-suited for anything longer than 30 seconds. Where that misfired more than it hit, the sequel begins rather well as the now disgraced spy is called out of his retreat in a Tibetan monastery (where he's learning, among other things, the martial art of dragging boulders with his testicles) by a reluctant MI7 to uncover an assassination plot aimed at the Chinese premier.

Some of the jokes are out of date - his sparring with Gillian Anderson's unimpressed spymaster, all impeccable but monotonous pronunciation, is like a flat rewrite of Judi Dench's scenes in GoldenEye that's 16 years too late - but there's plenty that does raise a smile or the odd laugh, not least a particularly well-executed parkour chase scene across the rooftops and along the dockside of Hong Kong where the joke is that, despite obvious audience expectations, English's ineptitude constantly fails to materialise as he never puts a foot wrong and repeatedly outthinks a killer with a minimum of effort. But once the action leaves Hong Kong it obviously forgets to pack the jokes for the return trip and becomes a tired but watchable run-through of stale routines that weren't that funny when they were being done back in the 60s when people first started making mediocre Bond spoofs - the clumsy would-be knowing banter with a villain over a game of golf, the gadget filled chase scene (here in a motorised wheelchair), the assassination attempts by a ridiculous villain (here an elderly Chinese cleaning lady) survived through dumb luck rather than skill... you've seen it all before, and better done, and compared to the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OSS-117-Cairo-Nest-of-Spies/dp/B0037FUCMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies</a>&nbsp;it seems stuck in the last century in the wrong way.

There are some compensations, with the biggest surprise how much better Rosamund Pike is here than in her genuine Bond film, Die Another Day, giving a much more natural and appealing performance in a role that's not much more than reaction shots and exposition before turning into the romantic interest just because that's part of the formula. It's a shame that she doesn't get more to do, but that could apply to most of the cast in a comedy that seems to have been made by a director who doesn't really want to do a comedy in a classic case of trying to turn the film he's been hired to make into the different kind of film he'd rather be making instead.

That problem is increasingly apparent from the deleted scenes on the Blu-ray and director Oliver Parker's rationale for cutting most of the funnier moments purely to keep the story moving while bizarrely leaving the now redundant and occasionally laborious moments setting them up in the final cut: in this kind of film the story is really nothing more than a near irrelevant coat rack to hang the jokes on, and it's the jokes that should take priority. As he rationalises his decisions as ""small sacrifices worth making"" to get to the next mundane plot point you can't help thinking he's the kind of director who'd cut the farting cowboys out of Blazing Saddles because it wasn't really moving the story forward. Not that there's much originality on display in them, but some - an extended walk-through the newly privatised MI7, English so preoccupied with trying out the gadgets in his car that he doesn't notice machine-gun firing killers are chasing him or a throwaway gag with some exploding chewing gum - are much better than what did make the final cut even if they did need a bit of tightening. The same could be said of the deleted scenes presentation as well since the disc doesn't offer the option to skip Parker's near-identical explanations for cutting the jokes out of a comedy.

Aside from a decent 25-minute making of and a not particularly funny gag reel the rest of the extras are the usual puff pieces on how Atkinson is the comic Messiah, though his perfectionism is absent from what makes it to the screen in the last two thirds of the movie. Like so many movies shot digitally rather than on film the 2.35:1 widescreen picture quality tends to vary from sharpness (usually in studio scenes and the Hong Kong section) to a rather soft, pallid, undetailed and lifeless look (most of the exteriors) but is acceptable.",1351900800,7,4631,4.956241956241956

He is called out of retirement for a mission to China to hunt down ""Vortex"" an assassination group out to kill the Chinese premier. There are 3 keys, or key parts that must be gathered together to have access to a secret weapon.

The first good joke was the ""Toshiba"" sponsor sign for MI-7 secret services. The humor is more than just slapstick. Rowan Atkinson combines the sophistication and intellect of James Bond with the zaniness of Peter Sellers. Indeed, for those who loved Peter Sellers would also enjoy Atkinson who doesn't attempt to copy Sellers, but rather create a character in his own style reminiscent of the master. The early scene with the cat had me laughing out loud at the classic style of Atkinson.

English is aided by agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya), a sidekick that has his own failings. Excellent use of the sound track. Worth seeing. Simply hilarious.

They are different kinds of comics. So if you buy this film thinking ""Ah, Peter Sellers"" you will be very disappointed.

You probably know the basic story. A disgraced spy, studying in Tibet, gets  a call from MI7 to come back to the fold, he's the only one that can do the job. Surprised and pleased, he goes back to England to find about the job. Apparently an assassination is being planned and a former agent knows all the info will only talk to Johnny English.

Of course, you know there will be double agents, pratfalls, physical comedy and to me, much fun.

I am sure the UK has plenty of actresses looking for work. And I am not a big fan of Gillian Anderson's acting.

AMAZON REVIEWS, by contrast are mostly just people giving their honest opinion, with no money being slid under the table.

The critic for this movie called it ""HYSTERICALLY FUNNY"". No. What is hysterically funny is the fact that everyone now knows that you, movie critic, have no integrity. If I were a bit drunk, having a great day and were a tad more mentally confused, I MIGHT go so far as to say this movie was mildly, sporadically, childishly ""amusing"". No...that's going too far. Call it ""NOT totally devoid of humor"".

I always liked Rowan Atkinson a bit. Just a bit. British humor - aside from Monty Python - always seemed to me to lag behind American humor by a few decades. (Maybe 'cause we get the shows 20 years after they're filmed.) This movie may show Atkinson at his prime. Unfortunately, I think his prime was about 1970, and he doesn't appear to have updated his material. I have seen every one of his slapsticky-type gags hundreds of times in hundreds of movies since then, and most were done hundreds of times better, fresher, more original and FUN NI ER. That's about it. Old, tired gags, lackluster-ly performed.

I only watched the first half of the movie before I trashed it. Now, just think about those totally lame TV show ""comedies"" that are anything but, and think about how you will just sit there watching it, HOPING that something will soon strike your funny bone. Just HOW BAD does it have to be for you to totally give up and turn it off? This movie was THAT BAD.",1332115200,,1842,4.592705167173253

It is really truly funny, with lots of hilarious scenes, has great action, and Rowan Atkinson, who plays his role as Johnny English very well.  It also has a great plot in the story.  I think that this is a really awesome movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really entertaining movie that will make you laugh.",1331856000,3,379,4.478260869565218
4353397,4,B004EPZ00M,"One of the first few movies that we have rented and watched streaming via our Blue Ray player.  Amazon has done a great job with their online movie rentals.
Johnny English is classic ""Bean"" comedy with a few twists.  Don't expect some action movie, just a wholesome fun family flick!",1331683200,,283,4.64
4353398,5,B004EPZ00M,"Quality was great, received the DVD in good condition, and really enjoy being a customer with Amazon so far.  As for the movie:  This man is so funny!!!  Johnny English Reborn is even funnier than the first movie.  That is most unusual for the sequels to be better than the original but it is.  We even loved the directors commentary.  It showed even more how hard everyone worked and just seemed to enjoy the project immensely.  We all had a great time watching this for family night.  Everyone was laughing about as hard as I was.  We never buy a movie until we have seen it first and determine if it's a keeper for our collection.  But, we just had a feeling about this one and so glad we have a copy.  If you need to raise your spirits, get this movie; because anytime you need a good laugh this DVD will do the trick.",1331596800,,822,4.2387096774193544
4353399,1,B004EPZ00M,"Doesn't even deserve the honor of being called a parody. An obvious Bond 007 takeoff that was just dumb, not funny. Had that silent movies slapstick feel in which the viewer's time is better spent in watching the originals. Slapstick was funny the first time through especially since movies were still a novelty and anything that appeared on the screen was capturing, but reruns just get old. Basically the plot is of an MI7 agent who continuously makes stupid mistakes that help the bad guys more so than if he did nothing at all. Not to be confused with, or even in the same conversation with, the Peter Sellers' Panther movies although there seems to be, politely stated, a lot of borrowing from his movies.",1331510400,2,710,4.688

I must say that this movie is FUNNY AS HELL !!! Best Movie he's done yet and the FUNNIEST Movie to come out in the past few years!!!!
This is for ALL Mr. Bean fans, or for someone who wants a good laugh!!
Oh, and don't forget to watch the ending credits as there is a ""Special"" Scene that is just Genius!!",1331424000,6,396,4.223684210526316
4353401,3,B004EPZ00M,"I agree that the deleted scenes were way funnier! I had been so looking forward to the sequel but found the movie a little boring. Tried a little too hard, I would say.
Gillian Anderson is horrible here! Looked pretentious with a pretentious accent that keeps slipping! And what happened? She looks so dried-up and skinny - lost all her gorgeous curves! Her face looks wasted and ill.
Rosamund Pike is lovely but I find her role underdeveloped and she could have been more interesting! Only Agent One, the baddie is somewhat watchable.. And yes. They should have brought back Bough instead!
All in all, kind of stilted.",1331164800,,619,4.7407407407407405

4353645,2,B004EPZ00M,"I just finished watching this.

I hate say it, but something went wrong here?
No where as funny as the first .

Johnny English Reborn is kinda a failed satire .
As much as I like Rowan, Aka, Mr Bean.

They story is trying to be edgey... with character that far from it.
 Things were too fast paced in this. All characters seemed rather dull.
There was too much editing in this movie. proof is having about 20 mintues of
deleted scenes that were more funny than movie.
Director wanted edgey, faster, movie. Well he got it.
The result is just 2 stars rating.
I think this the final Johnny English.",1330732800,,595,4.333333333333333
4353646,4,B004EPZ00M,"With the continued success of the James Bond franchise, the occasional spy spoof is inevitable.  The resurrection of Johnny English is likewise inevitable.  And while not totally successful, this movie made me laugh a lot and is ultimately quite entertaining.
Rowan Atkinson is perfect as the deadpan agent who invites disaster and mayhem.  He ranks right up there with Inspector Clouseau in comic ineptitude.  Gillian Anderson brings an icy persona as English's no nonsense boss; Dominic West is good as arrogant agent Simon Ambrose; and Rosamund Pike, a former Bond girl, is the sexy psychologist.
There are plenty of hilarious sight gags and many action scenes parallel some of the 007 films.  JOHNNY ENGLISH REBORN doesn't set any new standards in film parody, but I had a good time.",1330560000,,787,5.069767441860465

4353649,2,B004EPZ00M,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of the original Johnny English movie, and also a fan of Atkinson... all I can ask is WHAT HAPPENED??  This was a movie that I WANTED to like so much and it almost felt awkward watching scenes that you could tell were SUPPOSED to be funny but fell short rather terribly.  This is a case where I blame the writers completely, as I had no issues with Rowan Atkinson's performance, and I thought Gillian Anderson was a neat casting choice but there are just too many weak moments to save this film.  Sure, we've got a bigger budget this time so they upped the scale of action sequences, etc. - but that's not what you watch this movie for.

There were TWO scenes that brought me to the floor laughing, so I didn't regret seeing it completely, and sure enough they happened to be somewhat minimal moments where Atkinson commanded the screen.  If your a fan of the original feel free to take a rental peek, but by no means don't purchase this film blindly.  I can't imagine them even attempting a 3rd film after this, such a shame.  They should have brought his talented and hilarious side kick Bough (Ben Miller) back.",1330387200,,1148,4.412322274881516
4353650,5,B004EPZ00M,I actually nearly fell out of my cinema seat from laughing at the 'conference chair' scene. I think I embarrassed myself but my husband was actually SNORTING with laughter - (which I had never heard before) so I was slightly less embarrassing. I never did really like Mr Bean or Black Adder so was doubtful that I would like the first Johnny English film but it just made me laugh so much and this latest one made me laugh even more.  I strongly recommend it.  Really good fun. And very much a family film.,1330387200,,506,4.372340425531915
4353651,1,B004EPZ00M,"Because the world was simply chomping at the bit to get more of bumbling secret agent Johnny English back in 2003, he made a return to the big screen eight years later and Johnny English Reborn was... born. I, however, found the sequel only slightly more bearable than the first film and another unfortunate waste of Atkinson's comedic talents. Reborn finds our wacky hero off the grid and training deep in Asia when he is called upon once again by MI7, this time to help thwart an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier; double crosses and pratfalls ensue. If you're familiar with Rowan Atkinson's previous work, then you know what you're getting here. Expect a lot of broad, slapsticky humor in service of well-worn spy spoof clichs, and if that's your thing, then have at it. But, there's no guarantee this will appeal to anyone outside of its target PG demographic.",1330387200,2,875,4.801324503311259
