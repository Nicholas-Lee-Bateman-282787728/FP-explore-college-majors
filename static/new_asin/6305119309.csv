976451,4,6305119309,"Carry On Cleo is perhaps one of the funniest and best of the Carry On Collection.  This technicolor film has all of the ""Carry On"" cast including guest appearances by Jim Dale and Francis DeWolf. Cleopatra never had it so good.  If she did, she would have died laughing.",1204588800,,270,4.489795918367347
976452,4,6305119309,Ummm........... These movies are not out of print they come from the carry on collection for the price these sellers are selling them for you could by the whole collection for that price. the series gets five stars..................,1149552000,,232,5.131578947368421
976453,5,6305119309,"Carry On Jack is a terrible film and never should have been released on DVD but .... Carry On Cleo is far and away the best Carry On film ever. Everything is right and the gorgeous Amanda Barrie makes the bloated Elisabeth Taylor look like a reject. Almost every time she appears she seems to be taking a milk bath. It's easy to see why Caesar and Anthony desire her. How can Leonard Maltin give this only two stars? Of course he gave Charlotte's Web three stars so he's not to be taken too seriously.

Carry On Cleo and Amanda Barrie are so great that this release gets five stars even though Carry On Jack should have long ago been buried in an unmarked grave.",1111622400,,662,4.296
976454,4,6305119309,"Carry On Jack (1963) was the series first historical epics and is easily the most forgetable. Its not so much that its a bad film, but whats lacking in this is the true spirit of the Carry On's, probably as there are so many of the regulars missing - theres no Sid James, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor, Hattie Jaques or Kenneth Connor. Only Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey are the main regulars to be featured in this, though Jim Dale has a cameo role in this who starred in many of the 1960's Carry On's. Bernard Cribbins, who to be fair, blends in with the cast as though he'd always been a regular, plays Albert Poop-Decker, an unlucky man, who after years of struggle, finally wins his commission only to have his identity, rank and uniform stolen from him by Sally (Juliet Mills) who he soon falls in love with.  The historical accuracy is impressive with the sets and the costumes but this Carry On film misses its mark slightly though Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey are on fine form throughout.  An adequate comedy.
However the real reason to get this DVD (which compensates for the patchy Carry On Jack) is the inclusion of one of the series best and most fondly remembered entries in the series - Carry On Cleo (1964). When the great epic disaster Cleopatra starring Elizabeth Taylor was abandoned from filming at Pinewood Studios, the Carry On team took full advantage of the lavish sets and extravagent costumes, making it all look and seem more expensive than usual. The hopeless Hengist Pod (Kenneth Connor) comes up with the  idea of a square wheel to stop carts from rolling downhill - amusing stuff! However he and his neighbour (Jim Dale) are soon captured by invading Romans and are rapidly sold off as slaves. Julius Caesar (a superb comic turn from Kenneth Williams, taking lines such as ""oooo I do feel queer"" and ""Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in for me"" to new heights) has caught the flu from Britains damp climate and is unaware that his best general, Mark Antony (Sid James) has joined up with Cleopatra (played beautifully by Amanda Barrie), Queen of Egypt, to overthrow him.
Carry On Cleo is consistently amusing with Kenneth Williams and Sid James putting in one of their finest roles in the series. Charles Hawtrey also crops up hilariously being as overly camp as ever, in the role of Seneca whilst Joan Sims plays Calpurnia, which she plays to perfection as the tempramental, nagging, vase-throwing wife of Julius Caesar and this type of characterisation eratically became something of her trademark in the series. One of the very best in the series and was certainly the finest film they'd made up to this point. Classic British comedy at its very best!",1036368000,12,2699,4.726114649681529
976455,4,6305119309,"One of the best of the series, being lucky enough to have a reasonable plot combining various influences from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar to the Elizabeth Taylor film Cleopatra. Amanda Barrie reminds us of how utterly gorgeous she was before she was in Coronation Street, whilst Sid and Kenneth W. excel in their usual roles, Ken's first line being 'I do feel queer!' delivered in the way that only he could get away with. Eric Rogers' comic score is serious and oriental when necessary, but light enough just to underline the humour for the majority of the scenes. Charles Hawtrey, for once in the role of dirty old man, demonstrates that his range was wider than was ever required in most Carry-On films. Special praise must however be reserved for the costumes and sets, allegedly re-used from the Cleopatra film, they make the film look much more expensive than allowed by the usual Carry-On design budget. This film features a classic mid-period script from Talbot Rothwell, seeming neither as old-fashioned as the early films of the series, nor as vulgar as the last. Watch out for Jon Pertwee, heavily disguised as he was in each of his four Carry-On roles. This is well worth ($)of anyone's money, but if you can afford to wait, the widescreen DVD would probably show the scenery  to its best advantage.",1004918400,,1311,4.826666666666667
976456,4,6305119309,"Carry On Cleo is one of the series entries that will always be remembered. It simply is classic British comedy at it's best. When filming at Pinewood studios for the disastorous epic, Cleopatra, starring Elizabeth Taylor, was abandoned there, Peter rodgers and Gerald Thomas just couldn't resist the advantage of the lavish and spectacular sets, making it all look a lot more extravagent than most of the other Carry On's that were filmed on a shoe string budget. the cast are all on top form with Kenneth Williams as Julius Caesar and Sid James as Mark Anthony, delivering the funniest lines. Also included in the cast are Amanda Barrie in the title role, Joan Sims, Jim Dale, Kenneth Connor as well as guest appearances from acclaimed classical actress, Sheila Hancock and Warren Mitchell from the classic sitcom, Till Death Do Us Part.
Hilarious from beginning to end and packed full of classic one liners (""infamy, infamy, they've all got in for me"" cries Kenneth Williams as Julius Caesar as he is about to be killed). This is a absolutley essential Carry On and is a great one to induct somebody who has never heard of this long running and triumphantly succesful British comedy series.",990921600,5,1192,4.848039215686274
976457,5,6305119309,"If the above title has you chuckling, this is the movie for you! A spoof of Anthony & Cleopatra done in the inimitable Carry On style. Jim Dale & Kenneth Connor as the heroic Ancient Brits, Sid James as the  asp-chomping Mark Anthony, and Bernard Bresslaw as Agrippa the bodyguard  are all classic characters.

976794,5,6305119309,"Looking at some of the ""recent"" reviews, oh, circa 1990, perhaps: I wonder why someone would complain the film was dated and silly. Of course it's date, duh, look at the promo, moron.  However, It WAS silly then and thankfully at least for myself and dog, we both had previously seen this film, liked it then just because it IS silly; now liked it because it is dated and silly. I stumbled upon it, took the shot and now must ask if I really want to cancel Prime, next month before renewal, IF they come up with more of this ""dated and silly"" stuff.  This is Python and so many other freekies, I just love this older, more ""tacky"" form of silly and senseless. It needs to be senseless, IMO, so we can turn off, tune out and just cool it for a bit. Made and produced befroe 2000 or as most of us boomer don't give a darn's think of it: You millenials grasping at what may be: nuthin' new. Another date line. Big whoop? ersonally, I have not yet encountered vampires, ghouls, ghosts, visitors or whomever...has not happened. Bills, I get. Trans-inferational deducts of axion products for speculation still leave ME kinda cold.  I dunno.  Still, like it or not due to the boomers such as myself out there, these programs will c151401ontinue to be requested; and since OUR GEN has more money, we shall buy it. Want financial success?
