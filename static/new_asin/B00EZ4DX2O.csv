8610634,5,B00EZ4DX2O,"Amnesiac begins with an Irish folkish song that makes me wonder if Simon & Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"" is actually based around Irish folk since this song resembles the Simon & Garfunkel classic so much.

The story in the intro is that in 1979 a man had a home, wife and a kid like any other... but he did terrible things.

When the story begins, it alternates between two sisters along with a man (who I think is the black-haired sister's husband) participating in a Ouija board experience, and the man we hear in the intro about doing terrible things to his family.  This man is constantly seen outside somewhere in Ireland.  The two sisters do nothing but fight for 20 minutes.  They fight over jealousy issues (""mom liked you more and considered you the golden child!"") says the one girl to her black-haired sister.  The one sister is trying to contact her dead baby.  At least I think so.  She's certainly desperate to get this seance underway and demands her black-haired sister participate in it.  The black-haired sister is the one who acts a little snotty assuming that her sister trying to contact her dead baby is weird.

Turns out sacrifices and rituals occurred in animals and children in this very room.  We now see men in a cave with deformed faces and metal things attached to their faces.  They all moan and act weird.  One man grabs another and shakes him violently.  They all wait for this mustardy substance to squirt from a wall.  When the group tries to escape the Ouija board room the door fills up with red vines.  The sisters contact someone who's in control of the situation and if they don't obey him, they won't be able to escape the room.  The man they're contacting -who is also the man walking around Ireland- also lost his son.  At least I think so!

The sisters ask questions through the Ouija board if the man's in this room with them or in a box.  The man answers with ""baby"" and the sister who lost her baby is suddenly overwhelmed with baby screams.  The man of the group changes his voice into a demented sound and gets dizzy questioning why the black-haired sister got startled over the baby answer.  It's not her baby after all.  The man with the two sisters envisions being in a cemetery with the man who lost his baby, and whom the group is trying to contact through the Ouija board.  His voice continues the demented-ness.  A bag of blood hangs down as the black-haired sister questions who he (the man walking around) is going to kill.  The man's voice continues dissolving into a deeper-voiced demonic blur and it's almost funny how this scene lingers on way too long.  He envisions the man who lost his baby (and who we know now killed his baby) coming up and stabbing him beside the cemetery.

The black-haired sister begs ""Stay with her"" since he's dead.  Who?  The baby!  The other sister slaps some sense into her as she accuses the baby's death of being her fault.  They hear a baby crying in the room above while the man stands up with a zipper over his face.  The lights flicker as he strangles the black-haired girl much to the satisfaction of the dude in the cemetery imitating a strangling motion.  The sisters think it's best to pick up his body and throw it into the closet nearby.  The black-haired sister becomes angry she's trapped in a demonic underground room with witchcraft going on.

The sisters think about ways to communicate with the spirit.  The baby killer man is walking around outside chasing after someone who is favoring his knee.  He limps all the way to a dead body as the baby killer man from behind wraps up a rope and wraps it around the man's neck while he's attending to the dead woman.  It's not nice to not let people mourn.  We see the black-haired sister fall over dead.  The other sister (the mother of the dead baby) goes ballistic.  She's now the only one in the room alive.

She hears ceiling knocking while the man who was just outside in the cemetery and strangled the dude in the scene prior is now in an underground room watching a puppet show on TV.  Yup, the baby killer dude.  He lets a woman in.  It's his ex-wife.  She's worried about him since he's in a poor state.  He wants to know how his ex-wife can leave him for that... small rag?  That's what it sounds like he says in reference to another man.  We're making sense again.  It's been a while since the story did that.  Hold on tight- it won't last!

The baby killer man is now outside hanging puppets on a clothesline in the woods.  He strangles a stuffed bunny and blood pours out.  ew!  Who'd fill a stuffed bunny with ketchup?  The man returns to his cave and hands the blood-filled bunny to his ex-wife.  He claims he'd never hurt his son but his ex-wife doesn't know that.  The baby killer man was gentle and funny but he's different now with mood swings.  She was afraid to speak.  He never laid a finger on her though.  He mentions killing their son.  Oh did you?  I'd like to hear that explanation please!  It might, you know, make some *sense* out of this story.  No explanation yet.  Darn!!

He plays the puppet show for his ex-wife.  A little girl in the movie hears trembles and the baby killer man watching this gets excited.  I can't understand the rest of this scene due to the thick accent of the narrator woman.  The woman from the puppet show on TV makes her puppet eat jelly off a plate.  The ex-wife turns the program off and says she'd never get away saying something like that on TV.  The baby killer man claims the puppet woman is not who she claims she is.  It looks like her but it's someone borrowing her face.  The man says the story we just heard about how the little girl is meant for him.  ""My TV's been horrible for a while now!"" he syas.  Oh he must have Directv too!

He talks about the seance that occurred with the two sisters and the man.  This baby killer man saw someone else there- a man from the future holding a suitcase.  The baby killer man is outside again.  He sees a woman holding her baby beside a tree.  The baby screaming is so annoying he has to cover his ears.  He knew it- the dead mother with the baby would try speaking to him.  Now he's being tormented by her.

The ex-wife says the baby was crying day and night and would disappear for days on end.  The man doesn't remember this, nor does he remember the animals burning on the fire.  Turns out these images we see of the man are just dreams and thoughts in his head.  The ex-wife encourages him to get out of this room and see his aunt.  He says without his ex-wife there's no use.  No use seeing doctors or anything.

The man says he scares himself because someone won't let him stop.  He has to rely on it because it becomes a part of him.  What is ""it?""  A new life growing inside.  The ex-wife recommends counselling and help because this isn't a common problem.  The man mentions his ex-wife sneaking around.  He watched the secret meetings and purposely drove himself to madness.  The ex-wife says that's not at all true and that she tried getting him some help.  He calls her a liar.  She tries to leave the room to go back to her boyfriend but the baby killer man won't let her go.  He wants her to bring that man to him.  While grabbing the man she questions what the man was doing on one particular instance.  He says he was watching her but the ex-wife was lonely.

The ex-wife screams that there's no way she's letting this man near her baby.  The man begins to strangle her in anger.  She insists he's a freak who needs help.  He lets go of her throat and bangs his head.  Yup, he's a mighty frustrated man.  The man looks at his ex-wife's throat.  There's a black mark on it.  She gets serious and demonic and asks if he remembers.  Now his anger diminishes as the ex-wife asks if he remembers what he did in the woods.  He must've done something because he's no longer angry.

He gets quiet instead of angry so we can safely assume he remembers.  The TV turns on by itself so we can continue viewing the puppet show.  The man grabs his head again.  ""My god I did it!"" he says.  He killed the baby.  He mentions a woman holding and cradling a dead baby appearing to him while his ex-wife took a nap.  This woman would always put poison in the man's ears.  He wanted the nothingness to stop so he followed his ex-wife into the woods.

We now see a flashback of the man talking to his ex-wife normally in another location and not knowing what she means when she mentions murder and wanting her baby.  He says she doesn't have to stay here anymore.  She smiles in a demonic way as we see her bloody hand.  It's actually the ex-wife who has the dead baby- not that woman in the woods!  The man realizes this.  The sound of bees quickly swarm up the stairs.  The man pulls back the curtains and we hear a demented voice with lights flickering, but this is just a mere distraction so we can't read the red words on the wall.

The man cuts his hand open as his ex-wife stands by and laughs.  He says she hasn't won yet.  The man places a bloody knife on the wall and asks if he's there.  The knife moves across the wall.  A demented voice from the ex-wife speaks but the man tells her to put a lid on it.  Meanwhile the knife continues to dart around the wall in a bizarre way.

The man says manifestations are going to happen.  His ex-wife with her new demented voice... agrees? disagrees?  I can't tell.  Oh, disagrees.  She's not hear to have a picnic with the man after all.  She's now flashing around and walks backwards through the wall.  The woman on the TV puppet show says she tried to help the ex-wife but wasn't able to.  She's happy talking maliciously to her puppets.

We hear baby screaming louder than ever as the TV flies off the cabinet and forward towards the guy.  The cut on the man's hand disappears and the lights flicker like mad.  Someone jerks the desk forward now.  The man gets angry and pushes the objects off the desk.  Just then the tension slows down allowing the man time to apologize and pick up a small blanket.

Suddenly a red-lit woman peels through the walls and approaches the man.  She looks like the Ouija board sister from the first half of the film.  In a demented voice she says she won't give the man his son back.  The demented voice of the woman says he was a bad husband.  The man says he found a knot in his baby's empty carton.  The evil looking woman asks if he felt isolated.  He says he did.  Maybe this is the therapy session the ex-wife recommended earlier.  We all assumed an actual licensed therapist- not this!

The man says all he had to do in order to kill the baby was just be there.  When he got back it was still daylight.  he broke into the baby's room and noticed how quiet he was.  The man picks up the stuffed bunny rabbit.  He says the baby didn't make a voice when he placed the rabbit over his body.  The baby kept looking at him like he wasn't there anymore.  The man stayed with the baby all through the night.  The baby wouldn't wake up even though he stayed with the baby.  Why couldn't this just be a bad dream?  The baby died in his sleep.

The demented woman disappears while the man picks up the upside down TV and places it on the wall again.  We see the man outside looking at a scuba diver who's standing on top of a hill.  He walks up the hill after the scuba diver and grabs his head.  The baby killer man sticks a red missile into the throat of the scuba diver as blood squirts.  We hear baby screams as the scuba diver rolls down the hill.  He almost rolled into the pond but not quite.  The man walks down the hill and pushes him into the pond.  Okay cut!  cut!  This scene needs a second take to get it right, hehe.  He's supposed to go in the pond the first time, hehe.

The man grabs the scuba diver's head, pulls the mask off and looks at him while he drowns.  The man walks away with the mask in his hands.  Back in his cave the man pulls out a knife and cuts his wrist.  We hear the intro story again how the man was like any other man with a wife and kid.  The movie ends.  The credits theme is really pretty with piano- not at all folkish like the intro melody.

To put it simply, even though the storyline makes no sense whatsoever, the sister who lost her baby and who was using the Ouija board with her sister, comes back from the dead to kill the man who killed her baby.

This movie made no sense at all so I enjoyed it for completely the wrong reasons.  Even trying to figure out this big mess of a confusing storyline is a recipe for disaster.  Sure, you can grasp the main chunk of the story- a man killed a baby, and the woman with the Ouija board wanted to contact her dead baby, but those are the only two things that make a lick of sense.  The strong Irish accents make the story that much harder to understand.

The hilarious part (besides the entire story) is that it appears a high budget production was used to make this movie.  The actors are all really believable in their roles and Amnesiac looks like a quality movie on the surface... but the writing is beyond bad!  Another hilarious part is that I purposely avoided watching this movie for a long time assuming I was saving the best for last.  I guess I was right.  It's the best at something- humor!",1499212800,,13239,4.307973962571196

Since I brought it, I gotta try one more time to sit there and watch it in it's entirety.

I can't recommend this; because even I can't sit still to watch it.  LOL",1389484800,4,371,4.111111111111111
8610638,2,B00EZ4DX2O,"After losing her baby, Kate (Gemma Deerfield), her skeptic sister Bec (Edwina Lea) and her boyfriend Thom (Leon Florentine) decide to contact a spirit using a Ouija board, and a nice wooden board at that. They contact a spirit of a man (Jon Stoley) who also lost a son and his story is told as a subplot. You sprinkle in some amnesiac madness and a pagan baby killing cult and you have a story.

The actors are Irish and spirits use voice enhancers making understanding them difficult.  This is a low budget avant-garde type of horror film that had a few good horror scenes, but for reason decided to bore us with long scenes explaining the past told in a haphazard fashion. I liked the effect of the opening singing, but the poetry which followed went too long.

This film was under the working title ""Wyke Wreake"" and will have a narrow audience.  Unfortunately I was one.
