Very hard to find,but worth getting if you want the english language version that was released in the United States under the title Body Snatchers From Hell. The one I received was the German release.",1493337600,,268,4.604166666666667
8431426,3,B004IZVD1S,"If you like 60's scifi horror, this one may be worth a look. It does not come near the creepiness or semi-brilliant quality of Planet of the Vampires, but is somewhat on par with Queen from Outer Space.

The bad: the characters are not well-written, and some of them randomly lurch from one way of thinking and behaving to another in ways that lack motivation. Melodramatic subplots involving a political assassination, a mad bomber, and corporate / political bribery also detract from opportunities to instead create mood and atmosphere, and are not coherently folded into the main story.

The good: At the same time, the movie does have some creepy moments, some cool 60's special effects, and nice use of color. Also, while I do find the political and terrorist content to be very cumbersome, it does mark the movie as a very self-conscious product of its time, and seems to be part of a conscious effort to create theme and make social commentary. There are frequent references to the ongoing Vietnam War (one of the characters is a recent widow of an American soldier killed in the war), and of course high profile assassinations and terrorism had become an awful sign of the times. Similarly, Japan's unique perspective on nuclear annihilation and apocalyptic threats is very present. I also really like how the movie ended. It's one of those movies that really comes to fruition in the closing minutes, and in quite striking fashion.

So, bottom line, definitely worth a look for fans, but those who more enjoy mainstream contemporary scifi or horror may want to look elsewhere.",1353628800,,1585,4.884758364312268
