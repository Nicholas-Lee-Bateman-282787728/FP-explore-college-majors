1689134,4,B0000639GP,"Chac: The Rain God is one of those very rare DVD's that offers a unique film with an even better audio commentary.  I did not give this my highest rating because the film is slow and would not entertain everyone.  It is very dry and subtitles are a turnoff to most (I'm used to them because I watch a fair number of foreign films).  Not all that is spoken is translated, which I found a little annoying.  I would like to have known more of what the Diviner was saying.
The film itself is a mix of documentary and a somewhat slow, but satisfying story.  The characters are all well-drawn and it is a true Journey film where we enter two worlds - the world of the villagers and the world they enter as they are led by the Diviner to prepare for the rain ceremony.
The commentary, though, was a tremendous surprise.  I buy few DVDs that don't have commentaries, but most are pablum compared to this.  Robort Klein is humble, informative, reflective and gives great insight, not just about the film process in working with non-actors, but also about the Mayan world.  I am an avid Mayan reader and want to do my own film on the Maya, and this film was fulfilling on all counts.  It is sad, also, from his view two decades later, to learn what happened to these people.  The commentary is actually better than the movie and a movie about the making of this movie and what happens later would be at least as satisfying.
NOTE: You do not have to be a Mayan enthusiast to enjoy this film.  All you have to be is someone who cares about the loss of richness created by the encroachment by Modern society on other cultures.
This film will leave you thinking for a long time afterwards.  And that is good.",1023062400,15,1694,4.3428571428571425
1689135,5,B0000639GP,"This film reflected how separated we have become from nature. We no longer hear the voices of our ancestral lineage. We have become dead in a world that pulsates, speaks and interacts with us each and every moment.
In this film we see how ceremony and ritual helps to bridge that gap and bring us closer to our world.
If you get an opportunity watch Rolando Klein's 1974 documentary ""Chac: The Rain God"", a film about the Tzeltal Indians of Chiapas (South America)living in the remnants of the ancient Mayan Empire. During the ceremony, the shaman uses sound, which mirror Kototama child sounds..., to call upon nature's elements. The beauty of this film is how it embraces the purity of being connected to one's world through ceremony. Each action is of ceremony and ritual...ripples upon the water of life.
Hidden is not always hidden, sometimes it is just not seen because we fail to look. This film mirrors both man's faithful interaction with the divine nature of life, and his skeptic beliefs which tear him from the fabric of life.",1002931200,6,1038,4.772222222222222
1689136,5,B0000639GP,"""Chac"" was filmed in the seventies using native Mayans as actors.  In his only film, director Rolando Klein lived with the Mayans in Chiapas, Mexico and recruited them as actors.  When he was done he feared he had changed their lives and their culture forever.  The movie is done in a spare, ethnographic style without flashy Hollywood sound or special effects.  The result is to draw you into another world and by the time the Diviner goes into a trance and calls the Chacs, in order to bring rain, you are a believer in his power.  You also witness the disintergration of the village leader when he loses his faith and  believes his power is being usurped by an unscrupulous Diviner.  The shocking ending proves the Diviner true and the faithless headman's destruction is assured.  The film, which also relates the story to the Popul Vuh, the Mayan creation myth, is a must have for those interested in the Mayan culture or spiritual quests.",996192000,6,943,4.7073170731707314

7958935,5,B0000639GP,"I saw this film when it was released. It is incredible and wonderful and magical in a way that so indelibly scored in my imagination that I have never, ever forgotten it. The scene where the duende (gnome) turns into a jaguar is myth visualized. I have looked for this film for a very, very long time. This morning something told me to check again, so I bought it here!

7958938,1,B0000639GP,"Most people, I think, would find this movie very confusing.  I did, and I have spent almost a year in the hinterlands of Guatemala and am very familiar with the people today as well as the beautiful ruins of abandoned cities. It's a painfully slow movie and at one point the translation of dialogue stops completely.

Don't waste your time.  There are better ways to understand other cultures.",1301270400,,393,4.75
7958939,4,B0000639GP,"I'm a lover of Mayan culture and was very happy to find this film at the public library.  I did find the first half rather slow and I actually stopped watching it, intending to return it.  When my plans changed I decided to finish it and found that the second half is more interesting.

The most intriguing figure in the film is the Diviner.  Whether he is played by a local villager or a professional actor I don't know, but he is magnificent.  I think that if he had not been present I would not have bothered to watch the rest of the film.  His physical apprearance is splendid; he looks like one of the gorgeous carvings on Mayan temples.  He doesn't speak much but his actions are direct and powerful but graceful.

The story itself is simple.  The film will appeal to those who are interested in this culture.  Others may find it slow.

Another reviewer recommended listening to the director's commentary.  I did not do this but if I have time I will do so.  He said it's better than the film.",1276041600,,999,4.364130434782608
7958940,5,B0000639GP,"This is a superb ""little gem"" of a film was shot in Chiapus Mexico in 1974 in the area around San Cristobal de Las Casas. With one or two exceptions, the actors are all residents of the village where most of the filming took place. It is an area of stunning beauty. Chac was an early example of a film style that combines a theatrical script with a documentary approach. Chac contrasts the ancient mythology  (drawn from the Popul Vu) with contemporary village life of the Maya. It is a film for adult viewers. This is a film you'll likely want to share with friends which may lead (as it has with me) to the purchase of multiple copies; ""gifts"" from my lending library!",1259625600,4,670,4.403225806451613
7958941,4,B0000639GP,"Doesnt fall into any of the routine categories. If not for these kinda movies, view of the diversity of existence as such a different culture would be lost completely in a few decades.",1207612800,,184,4.606060606060606
7958942,5,B0000639GP,"This film is profoundly well done.  The director creates the feeling that you are truly among these descendants of the Mayans who have lost their contact with the ancient ways.  In the midst of a drought, they seek a diviner who can ask the rain God Chac to send rain.  The problem is that the village chief considers the diviner to be a witch, and possibly he sees his power threatened also.  The men of the village are led on a quest to obtain the needed materials for a ceremony -- the ceremony takes place -- and then we see the denouement in which (I don't think this is a spoiler) possibly all links to the past are destroyed through foolish behavior.  The actors were apparently locals, but they were truly outstanding.  The man who played the diviner did a fine job.  Actually, the entire film must be seen to be believed.  I shudder to think that this movie sat in a closet (one copy left only) for 25 years.  How many other works of genius have we lost?",1106092800,5,963,4.335195530726257
7958943,4,B0000639GP,"Chilean filmmaker Rolando Klein traveled to southern Mexico--the Chiapas region--to film Chac the Rain God in 1974.  Chiapas is next to Guatemala, yet the language spoken in the film is not Spanish but a Native American dialect indigenous to that region.  Because of the simplicity of the story, it's impossible to tell when this actually takes place.  We do know that it must be at least the 19th century because the cacique, the tribe chief, has a rifle that resembles one from around that period seen in American Westerns, among other venues.

But aside from the rifle, this could be set as much as a thousand years ago.  Villagers in a small tribal settlement are afraid of losing their crops because of no rain.  They consult their shaman but all he wants to do is get drunk.  In desperation the cacique and the men of the tribe consult the tribal elders and they tell of a diviner who lives alone high up in the mountains, who can bring rain to the village.

The mens' voyage to the diviner results in a much longer voyage he takes them on--through roaring waters and lush jungle, and finally into a deep cave where a critical element for the diviner's ritual to bring rain is found.  But the cacique is not happy; he is sure the diviner is really a witch who is mad and temporarily convinces two men of the group of 12 who have traveled to turn back.  In doing so, the cacique falls upon a bizarre noctural experience--whether dream or reality, who can say?

Shot through with this kind of magic realist, or surrealist imagery, Chac is a film that pulls the viewer in as surely as smoke arises from fire.  The primary emphasis in the film is on the elements--fire, water, earth, sky--because that is what and how the characters in the story know, and live, and function.  Those who are used to slam bang one-action-a-second American cinema would do well to steer clear of this film.  But for anyone needing a cinematic experience in which a main character is the land itself, Chac is a great film to immerse yourself in. The beauty of the jungle, the open blue sky meeting the lush earth, the great night fire that's set ablaze to perform the rain-making ritual, the roaring waters--all these move us.  These and the diviner.

The diviner's the primary human element who commands our attention; he moves the film forward and, even closer to the four elements--in mystical ways--than the villagers themselves, he gives the film its intriguing power; the villagers are in awe of him for what he can do, and the viewer will be too, I believe.

Highly recommended.",1103587200,8,2567,4.631346578366446
