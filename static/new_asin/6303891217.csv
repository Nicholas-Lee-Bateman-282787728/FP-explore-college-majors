722832,5,6303891217,"This documentary  paints an unflattering picture of my home town, Omaha, Nebraska in the mid 1960's. The story is about a minister in a Lutheran church in a neighborhood that is changing from white to black. He wants members of his congration to reach out to families of a black Lutheran church by socializing informally with them. The ""leaders"" of the white church cannot stomach it but alibi their cowardice by saying that step is ""too much too fast"".  Ernie Chambers, a spokesman for the black community in Omaha then and now is a calm voice of reason,as it turns out, telling the minister the truth about what he is attempting, pointing out that his own will turn own him. They do and he resigns. At the time Chambers was perceived as a ""wild eyed radical"" whose demands for equality were also considered to be too much too soon. In retrospect it is clear that he was villified by the traditional Omaha media for his desire for humane treatment for his race. No network would run this documentary because it was considered too inflamatory. It shows me how much things have changed and how small minded some in my former home can be",1306627200,,1135,4.586206896551724
722833,5,6303891217,"I will nearly always hands down endorse anything Mr. Chambers preaches. I have seen him in action and I know he preaches the gospel. The gospel of humanity. As someone who watched him captivate a classroom of students with the wit and energy of a magician and then gave each student a solid gold gift of knowledge; as someone who has been so moved by the power of his words; lightning!; whether a person agrees or disagrees; Ernie Chambers is a force, he is a light; he is a gift from God, even if he would argue that; I shall argue it right back to him; his eternal fight for justice is the light of humanity; the way a soul gets all lit up from seeing the raw fight in action; I urge everyone and anyone to witness Mr. Chambers and buy this documentary. There are detractors who will say that he is racist against white people and I have seen a different sort of Legislator; someone who goes in search of the broken down, the invisible, the ones who have gone unseen by society; someone who fights for the helpless, for the sick, and the kicked down, the poor, and for animals; I shall not join in on this warfare upon a warrior who has so unselfishley given over his life unto others; hear the call and force yourself to wake up and listen. Just listen and ask yourself if you do not once hold a certain stereotype or premonition about another that may be in need of a challenge. There is a certain honesty in asking oneself the question; who am I prejudiced against and how can I fight this. I plan on purchasing this documentary and keeping it in my forever library of forever voices right up there with Martin Luther King Jr. There are some people who are beacons that do not go out; though they may step away from the pulpit, their voice clangs the bell and forces the soul to rise up and question the status quo; question, question, question. Such a voice clears the way for everyone. Such Courage. Do not turn away from such courage. Hold the hand and take the time to understand. Mr. Chambers is one of the reasons we are fortunate enough to call Mr. Obama President, today. I do not believe that if such a man had not come before, then the way would not have been cleared. People knock him down and down, but you know what. That is blindness. It is ignorance. This documentary, no doubt will show the dark face of ignorance, and then hopefully the voice of clarity rising from the ashes. Ernie Chambers, is a legend, and his voice shall never be diminished. This documentary is such a gift, such a jewel. Any HS educator whether it is civics, sociology, history, political science; what have you, would be missing out, in not purchasing this. Do not miss out on this opportunity to spread the word. Continue the dream; continue the hope. ~",1268956800,,2750,4.404715127701375
722834,4,6303891217,"This documentary is masterful in its presentation. It gives a glimpse into what is wrong at the heart of the Church. This characters in the film identified a problem and thought of solutions with the typical human response to change, ""No, thank you"". It is ashamed that while we have come far, it is still evident that we have far too go to view each other as someone creatd in the image of God.

While this movie deals with a specific situation in a specific time and place, the essence of the movie is overriding and relevent to a present culture on issues of respect, human dignity and the gospel.

The reason I gave it a four is I felt the documentary's ending was poorly executed. It a condensed down to only minutes after long discussions. Insight into the decision making process, more interviews after the pastor left of the church and himself would have been a tremendous asset.",1224806400,,887,4.572327044025157
722835,5,6303891217,"This needs to be promoted better because no one has heard about this, but if they did, watch out. Ernie Chambers? I've never heard of this man, but i'm honored to know that he exists. This documentary is brilliant, especially for it's time period.",1156896000,5,247,4.636363636363637
722836,5,6303891217,"Having lived through this time, I was born and raised in Omaha, I now understand why I think the way I do.  Ernie Chambers and Dan Goodwin were, and still are, my barbers.  The conversations that went on in the barbershop were not staged, these are the type of exchanges that go on in 'Spencer Street Barber Shop' to this day.  This is where I earned my degree in 'Common Sense'  Thank God, I am now equipped to deal with the unfortunate reality that is America.  I wish I could say Omaha was unique, but it was not...this type of thinking goes on everywhere I have lived, now it's just a bit more covert, both black and white.  While I applaud Min. Youngdahl's effort, I was not surprised that he 'resigned'.  We all need to step away from our comfort zone...this documentary is our 'Picture of Dorian Gray'.",1147305600,10,809,4.425675675675675
722837,4,6303891217,"How does a church respond in a time when the country is exploding over the question of civil rights? The answer can be found in this documentary film of one church's response to the crisis. Filmed in 1966, the leaders of Augustana Lutheran Church in Omaha, Nebraska share with us their fears, hypocrasy, and racial prejudice as they come to grips with the social reality of their times.
  The pastor of the church makes the first move in listening to the voices of Blacks in Omaha who bluntly tell him the truth of what is going on. Moved by their words he challenges the church's social committee to initiate a ministry that can bring understanding and reconciliation among the groups.
  In watching this film you will witness the process of how a white church attempts to come to face the weakness of their faith, sense of justice and fears of reaching out. Every small step that they take is done with caution but they try. We see a church for the first time being confronted with the reality of what it means to be a Christian.
  As a sociological study of race relations and the white church this is an excellent film. You see the theological, social and cultural differences as to how two groups view Christianity. The African-Americans do not spare their white Christian counterparts in condemning them for not living up to the Christian gospel.  Augustan Lutheran Church is a good example of how a church can change and become relevant to the issues of its time if it will step out on faith. You will be hopeful at the outcome of this film as two groups struggle for reconciliation.",986083200,19,1590,4.617021276595745

7854411,4,6303891217,"An artifact from the 60's, this film follows a progressive minister of a Lutheran church in Omaha as he attempts to bring his white congregation to exchange meetings with a Black church. The discussions between the members of his church are agonizing as they confront their deep unacknowledged racism. The film begins with an intelligent incisive analysis of Black/White conflict made by a Black barber as he cuts hair, who predicts what will happen to the minister on his quest for racial progress. ""A Time for Burning"" is still totally relevant for today -- sadly.",1458259200,,566,4.968421052631579

7854413,3,6303891217,"I bought this documentary/movie because I live in the great state of Nebraska and  I see State Senator Ernie Chambers on television alot of time expressing his points of views. As we all know many news agencies are bias &  only report part of the story. I wanted to watch & listen as he expressed his opinions and too see if he waivered though out the years.

This is a good documentary and though I don't agree with his opinions all the time, he does make a lot of valid points. His opinions have not changed thoughout the years but time has not healed all wounds in Omaha. Omaha leadership has not done enough to help North Omaha. Just for the record, I'm white living in South Omaha.",1428624000,2,686,4.34375

Clear depictions of various views, including those of well intentioned but effete liberals of the 1960' and '70s.  Great, great reference to use in comparison between then and now, to see how far we have gotten.  Chambers is one of the most articulate leaders of the 20th and 21st centure.",1406851200,,411,4.8428571428571425
7854417,5,6303891217,"Wow!  This was a very enlightening documentary that showed that racism exists in the heartland just as much as in the South.
It was fun to see Earnie Chambers in his younger years.  The director of the movie said that he thought that Ernie should consider a career in politics!",1387152000,,277,4.52

I was pleased at the quality of the product that I received.  I know that this aired almost 50 years ago but I felt like I was sitting in the meetings as members of the church discussed racism and what to do about it.  This is as relevant today as it was then.  I am impressed!",1364256000,3,396,4.171052631578948
7854419,5,6303891217,"A Time for Burning is a film that grabs your attention immediately, both mind and heart. This 1966 documentary shot by the Lutheran Film Associates examines the efforts of Rev. Bill Youngdahl to rally his all-white congregation to have ten families meet with ten families from an all-black congregation in their mutual city, Omaha, Nebraska. What starts as what Youngdahl calls, ""Just a little thing"" soon blows up into conversations political, economic, personal, ethical, and theological.

Youngdahl is a wonder to witness as he never loses his cool during his uphill battle with his congregation. His calm demeanor is matched in word and wisdom by 30-year-old black neighborhood barber, Ernie Chambers, who gives Youngdahl the foreboding warning, ""If you try to do something, you'll get kicked out of your church"" in the first six minutes of the film. In the following scenes, several white men ask Youngdahl why the church must ""be so revolutionary"" with such a controversial issue, that it's taking ""a gamble,"" that this potential ministry could split the church wide open and could destroy ""What we've built up here."" It leaves the viewer wondering, exactly what has the church built up here in terms of radical, Christ-like hospitality? The question of ethics and deferring responsibility rises every other minute throughout the film.

The hidden main protagonist is layperson Ray Christiansen, whose heart is caught in a tug-of-war, sometimes hesitant and sometimes embracing of Youngdahl's idea. Christiansen's personal journey is powerful to witness as he listens to men say the same hesitant things he had said only a few days before, as he listens to Chambers ask him honest questions, and as he speaks with his wife about the importance of the situation: ""We've got our foot raised to take this first step... and we haven't got the guts!""

For someone like me, who didn't live through the 1960s in the US, the fear in these white persons over such a notion must be experienced to be believed. It is at once a reminder of how far we've come and how far we have yet to go in this journey of reconciliation. It also invokes other issues facing the church and other institutions in similar ways today. To this, Rev. Youngdahl asks an imp0rtant question for the church to consider today: ""Where does the element of the prophetic come into our ministry?""

Shot in cinma vrite or ""fly on the wall"" documentary style, this 55-minute film produced by Bill Jersey has editing that keeps the story engaging and is able to display stunning truth from all persons involved. In fact, the film opens with a title card reading, ""This film is dedicated to the people of Omaha, NE, who openly shared their doubts and fears."" Truly, persons' emotions are honest and starkly presented here, warts and all. A Time For Burning was nominated for Best Documentary Feature in the 1967 Academy Awards. Too controversial for the three major networks, they all passed on airing it, leaving it to PBS to run it in the midst of its historical context of the late 1960s.

The DVD presents the grainy, black-and-white film as well as it can. The image is clear and sound is well captured throughout the film, save a second here and there when the boom mic was being moved to another speaker. The commentary track features several voices including Jersey, Youngdahl, Christiansen, and Chambers and it lends engaging insight into how these men took in the events they lived and witnessed. There's a brief biography and statement from Jersey, as well as some information on Lutheran Film Associates, still up and running at lutheranfilms.org. A twenty-minute conversation with Ernie Chambers provides the young barber an uninterrupted pulpit several decades later and it's from this piece that the best parts are culled together for the audio commentary. I found the original song for the film written by Tom Paxton, arranged by B.G. Kornfeld, and sung by Ronnie Gilbert to be uplifting and I wish there was more information so I could find a copy to purchase.

A surprise gem of a special feature comes in the form of trailers, something I don't usually think of as a worthwhile special feature. Yet Docurama Films has included a solid list of information about 111 films in their catalog and a selection of eight trailers (none for A Time for Burning, sadly). The most fascinating trailer, to me, is a ""commentary track"" trailer of the oft-parodied Bob Dylan's ""Don't Look Back."" That trailer tells exactly how and why Dylan made the now-famous lyric-highlighting signs and explores why it's such an iconic image of American rock and roll.

I first experienced this film a month ago in an educated-related seminary course and have since experienced it with family and in a group discussion setting with teenagers in a church. It's definitely an attention-grabber and students had plenty of quotes to write down which struck them to ask about or discuss. There is also a free discussion guide available online with good questions and a list of civil rights events to give the film greater historical context which can serve as a starting point for discussion ([...]). Empathy for all persons in the documentary will be key to a group viewing and discussion. For as Ray Christiansen interprets himself, ""I am just such an infant that I know nothing other than the urgency.""

Thanks for reading.
