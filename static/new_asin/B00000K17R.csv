8127462,5,B00000K17R,I was tired of having all of my dinner napkins just sit there and not doing anything. Then I discovered Impressive 1 Minute Napkins on VHS and my life was changed forever.  When I saw how I could make my napkins stand out at a dinner party and become an extension of myself I could hardly believe how my life would transform from that moment.  If you have never seen a true napkin folded into a bird then you are not living life to the fullest.  Don't miss out on this great video that could help you or someone you know transform their life of boring square folded napkins into a life of napkin folding mastery.,1373068800,,612,4.258620689655173

However my students  in the middle school where I teach, once they get past him, enjoyed learning different napkin folding techniques.  He does go over each style several times so everyone understood how to do most of the different styles and techniques.  But every year I have to warn them ahead of time about how strange he is or the 13 and 14 year olds are either rolling in the aisles or recoiling in disgust.  ""HI I am Chef Ted.  I am not really a chef but my friends......My students think he is bizarre.
I bought this DVD to replace my old vhs version that was broken.",1221868800,,652,4.347107438016529

Really easy to follow instruction for a beginner like me. Everyone should have one of this DVD.,1188345600,,256,4.953488372093023
