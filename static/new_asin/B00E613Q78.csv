5891819,4,B00E613Q78,"This is a fun flick: An Italian beauty spends her life reviewing 5-star hotels across the globe. It's interesting to see the ways she ""grades"" the property's presentation to customers. Not only do we get to see fascinating locales, we tour beautiful top-grade resorts. The only real down-side is the sub-titles (the movie is in Italian) requiring one to take eyes of the screen to read the English narrative. Also, it would have been better with less family drama (who cares about the sister's love life?) and perhaps an in hotel, one-the-job, romance. Gardia's drop-dead gorgeous and the screen-play, although predictable, keep one's attention. For this movie the heroine's final rule for grading 5-stars is ""Trust Your Instincts"" (and have a look at the movie).",1467417600,,763,5.112

5891833,5,B00E613Q78,"A leisurely, yet not boring pace.  A strong female lead gives us a glimpse into an unusual career which ultimately alters the trajectory of her life and asks us to evaluate if the choice is worth giving up what is considered ""normal""  Is she really unhappy having bypassed the marriage, kids, home or does her choice reflect what makes her most happy, an introverted life of solace?  Does being alone really make you lonely?

5891837,2,B00E613Q78,"The scenery is stark and sterile-- just like the life the main character leads.  This film never gets underway. The portrayals are one dimensional and dull -- just like this film.  It's only rewarding moment is when we briefly meet an interesting Englishwoman. Then the story line dies again.

5891839,2,B00E613Q78,"Having personal experience in the hospitality business, I was weary of the setup for this movie. Nobody, if they have better choices, want to be in the service business and deal with the public, and dangit smile whether you feel it or not, it's all so fake. The main character seems to enjoys her job but doesn't look that happy to me. The whole look of this movie, to me, is of a tired woman, doing her glamorous job but deriving little satisfaction from it. She looks hunched with tired steps. Did she meet all kind of interesting people on her travels? NOPE, in fact she has to make up story to conceal her presence. Did she sightsee while on her job? NOPE, she seems to spend all her time at the hotels doing her job, and it's home-airport-hotel-airport. We only get a glance at the end that she does leisure travel with all her free miles. The ending is unconvincing. The only people I cared about in this movie are the newlywed couple not treated right, we all been there. The rest, they try to tell me a story but it's not convincing.",1424995200,,1041,4.371134020618556

5891850,3,B00E613Q78,"I have mixed feelings after watching the movie. The premise of the story sounds fascinating. The actors are likable. Most of the scenery pleasant. The trailer led me to believe that I would get to see the glamour in Irene's career and what made it so worthwhile to be in it. In addition, the interesting story on the relationship with her sister could have been more touching. You don't get to feel for either of them much (nor anyone else really). I understood from the previews that we would see the pros and cons in the life of the two sisters. It is so chopped that you don't get feel either life is good. The narrator at the end tells you the moral of the story which would have been better played out in the movie. I was disappointed. I do hope a remake is done on the basic story but with more depth to the characters and more insight into the worlds of the sisters. There were moments where a bit of humor could have been added. I wish they had shown more of the beauty and glamor in her travels. Characters drink and smoke often which does not add the the scene but is sometimes distracting. If I could cast the remake it would be:
Irene : Margherita Buy, Nicole Kidman or Catherine Zeta Jones
Silvia: Fabrizia Sacchi, Naomi Watts, Emily Blunt
Anyway, because the actresses were so likable I will keep the movie. The subtitles were good. I will wait a while before I watch it again and see if I like it better. Ok to watch but don't expect excitement",1419120000,,1459,4.328467153284672

5891856,3,B00E613Q78,"This was a movie showing the artifice of life in luxury hotels with paid-to-be-perfect help compared to living in the trenches of real and imperfect family relationships. It seemed the more protagonist tried to find things in error with the ""luxury life"", the more she became aware of how she had missed the mark in her real life. Her own apartment was a shambles with dead plants, bare spaces, dust, and very little in the refrigerator except old frozen vegetables to eat. I really hoped she would make a commitment to another person and stop the treadmill of travel as a hired mystery shopper, but the ending wasn't life-changing or satisfactory. Her life continued without making plans for the end of it. When she wouldn't be able to wear those 3 inch heels, when her constant expenditure on clothes to ""look the part"" continued to make savings impossible for her retirement, and her travel schedule limited a real investment of time in family, what would she do in old age? Move in with her sister and brother-in-law? She actually chose to let somebody else have the life she should have had instead. She kept on blindly ignoring the inevitable march of time. She could at least have taken time to get her hair done better since 5 star hotels always have beauty salons inside as part of the amenities.",1417996800,,1305,4.703056768558952

5891861,3,B00E613Q78,"Short on location shots, but a pretty good script that is more serious about life than expected compensates. The movie provides a sober look at the life of a ""globe trotting"" resort reviewer. I was looking forward to scenery from locations in exotic locales considering sponsorship of the Leading Hotels of the World. Unfortunately, the script limits travel inside Europe. The story is strong because it delves into the complications of romance and aging for someone with a life on the road. Excessive cigarette smoking, lack of interesting scenic shots and weak character development lead me to rating this no more than 3 stars. Pretty much a waste of time and money.",1417651200,3,668,4.973214285714286

5891864,5,B00E613Q78,"This was an excellent movie. I saw it at a movie theater in New York. I found the exacting details of what makes a top 5 star hotel great fascinating. Unfortunately, due to bad reviews from pedestrian ""film critics"" pandering to the masses, the film was only screened in just a handful of theaters in the US. What a shame as it was a gorgeously shot film and a typical ""European"" film with a subtle plot and a realistic ending. It's great that the DVD is available.",1417046400,,465,4.35632183908046

This story seemed a bit contrived to me and shallow really.",1416009600,,280,4.6938775510204085
5891868,5,B00E613Q78,"Lovely and deep without thumping you over the head with plot or ""message."" It doesn't answer anything, but gently raises questions. The hotels are beautiful, she's beautiful, her clothes fit perfectly as only an Italian woman of a certain age wears to perfection. There's the fact of some loneliness without depression or dwelling on it, and the fact of connection with all its imperfection.",1415836800,15,391,5.125

8601669,4,B00E613Q78,"What if you could stay in a 5 Star hotel whenever you wanted, eat marvelous meals and stay in the lap of luxury? That is the job, Irene, played by Margherita Buy, has, and this attractive woman in her forties lines her job. We learn from her, what the expectations are, and if a hotel misses too many marks, the hotel's rating is in jeopardy. A high stakes game, since no one knows who the mystery guest may be,
Irene lives in a spartan apartment when she is at home. She eats drab food, but eats well when she visits her sister and brother in law, and her two young nieces. Her life is good, but many around her feel she is missing out on family and children.

As we follow Irene around the world and see the gorgeous settings and luxury, we do see Irene is lonely. She has friends, but she begins to question her life when she meets another woman who talks about the lack of intimacy in life. This is a satisfactory film that lends a glance at the luxurious side of life. A peek into the other world, and a questioning of priorities.
