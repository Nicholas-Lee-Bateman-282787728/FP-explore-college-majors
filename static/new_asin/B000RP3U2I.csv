8202074,5,B000RP3U2I,"For the age of the VHS (manufactured about 1985), the video tape was in surprisingly good condition!
Delivery of the tape was much faster than predicted (5 days vs predicted 10-14).  Wish someone had
converted it to DVD before this!

Although the environment in which the video was recorded (about 1985), Dobson does a great job
presenting the information!!!  Every parent should watch this video prior to bringing their child home from
the hospital.  The information in the video would probably reduce a lot of stress in the home among family
members if parents had an opportunity to learn these topics!!!",1437609600,,606,4.97029702970297
