8266964,3,B0017RFXK2,"I vaguely remembered these from a few years ago, but I apparent;y remembered them as more exciting.  The artwork reminds me of Batman Beyond, but the story lines are almost non existent.  the writers also felt there had to be some kind of moral to each story as well.  a distraction, but little else.",1392163200,,300,4.518518518518518
8266965,4,B0017RFXK2,"Loonatics is a very confusing series. Not in terms of the episodes themselves, but what it is. It's almost like a mix of Looney Tunes and X-Men in the 28th century. Descendants of the original series (Ace Bunny, Lexi Bunny, Tech. E. Coyote, Rev Runner, Slam Tasmanian, Danger Duck, etc.) are set up with magical powers when a redioactive(?) meteorite impacts on the planet.

The first season goes its own way easily enough, with the weekly villains equal parts descendants of the original Looney Tunes bad guys (Ophichus Sam), all the way down to Sylvester and Tweety.

In the second season, every episode it seems has an homage to the original 'Tune shows. There's even an episode where Tech keeps falling from a cliff while on Rev's home planet. And he isn't even chasing the guy!

Like I said, confusing. It's Looney Tunes: The Next Generation meets X-Men, with the series trying to be worthy of both, and ending up in some middle ground.

Despite all that, I liked the series; the animation was great for the time, and I liked the first season's intro theme. As long as you don't take it too seriously, and you like slapstick, this is a good collection.",1319673600,2,1157,4.6568627450980395
