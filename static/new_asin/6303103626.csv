7839050,3,6303103626,"Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town

It starts with a view of a modern house. Ma is breaking eggs for pancakes. Three bathrooms but all in use. Note the top loading automatic clothes washer. Pa milks their cow. [A double did the milking.] They won a free trip to New York, railroad tickets are in the envelope, plus a ten-year supply of Bubble-Cola. The 9PM curfew bell was ended. The police are looking for a bank robber. Their fifteen children run for breakfast. Pa uses ketchup, not syrup. A tired driver arrives at the Kettles old home. Anybody home? Pa arrives to find the visitor asleep. Will he rent the place? He wants quiet to write poetry. [Why is his voice rough?] He calls New York to tell of his plan to let the Kettles carry his bag of money. An Indian has a chest of jewelry - to buy back Manhattan! A streamlined steam locomotive pulls a load of coaches.

Ma and Pa are greeted by their daughter-in-law. Will the wrong bag be taken? Those old taxis had an open roof so people could see the sights (high rise buildings). [No seat belts.] Note the box used as a suitcase (a good solution for a one-way bag). The Kettles learn that one bag is missing. A friend of Louies asks for that bag. Joe will keep an eye on them, he suspects a double-cross. A representative for Bubble-Cola brings their schedule and tickets to shows. Tom Kettle arrives to greet them. He has an investment scheme. The caretaker makes oatmeal for the kids. They listen to the Hallicrafters radio. Or will they try television? The Kettles ride a sight-seeing bus, then get off. See the panorama? Look how small the people are! A man takes their new bag. Two policemen watch Little Joe, then burst in to open the bag. [No search warrant?] But it only has scrap paper! Why would anyone want to steal an empty bag asks Tom. [This is New York city.] A man asks for the bag then runs off. There is a waiting time at the nightclub. The policemen are watching Louie. Routine checkup?

Ma and Pa chose a carriage for their trip. Once around the park. Louie calls Pa Kettle about that bag. Ma goes to a Beauty Salon, she will get the full treatment. Do not feed the animals. Louie finds the bag empty. Pa is questioned at the police station. Talk! [Note the wearing of hats.] Tom tells a detective about the bags, he has an idea. Ma shows up at the police station to ask for Pa. She looks pretty. They look at the pictures. The man who got the original bag calls Mr. Kettle at the Waldorf-Astoria.

There is a humorous conversation. The police have a plan to catch the robbers. The Washington State Police arrive at the Kettles new home to get Shotgun Munger. Munger is glad to see the police! [Is that believable?] In New York men follow that cab. The Kettles arrive at the Mastersons home. So do others. Buckshot on toast? Tom talks to George. Ma and Pa ask for a square dance; Pa will call. [Whatever happened to this traditional dance?] The Lieutenant arrests Louie. New York is a nice place to visit but theres no place like home. The Kettles find a surprise at home. So too the little darlings. But youve got to watch them.

Betty MacDonald wrote The Egg & I about her years at a chicken farm in Washington state in the 1930s. Raising chickens for eggs was a small business for family farmers then. Their chickens were free range, and later sold for meat when they stopped producing. Do you know how eggs are produced today? What will happen to the Kettles children after they grew up?",1388361600,2,3459,4.406885758998435

Although it only comes in VHS it doesn't matter to me. Love these shows
and love to learn that family and happiness along with a little right
from wrong on the side puts me in a reality check.",1238371200,,262,4.0576923076923075
7839053,3,6303103626,"Although THE EGG AND I, which came before, introduced Ma and Pa Kettle (Marjorie Main/Percy Kilbride) to film audiences, this is the second of their series as principals. While residing in the modern home that the pair had won in their first solo adventure, Pa wins a trip for both to New York City, with their apparent only problem the locating of a babysitter for the 15 Kettle children, solved when Shotgun Mike Munger (Charles McGraw), a bank robber in search of a hideout is willing to take on this formidable assignment. The Kettles agree to deliver an empty bag belonging to Munger to his ""brother"" Louie (Gregg Martell) in Gotham, not realizing it contains $100,000 in stolen cash and the fun begins with gangsters tailing Pa and the police keeping a watch on the thugs, all while Shotgun Mike discovers the tribulations of dealing with a surfeit of wild Kettle offspring on the homestead. Veteran Charles Lamont, who wears the director's hat for most of the Kettle titles, is also at the helm of other series efforts for Universal, including several Abbott and Costello larks, and shows a sure hand at briskly moving this type of material. The reactions of the pair to big city life, widely different from their Pacific Northwest roots, forms the core of the comic scenes which comprise the bulk of this feature. Despite the defined character of the scenario, a string of episodic set pieces is primary, some of which are wonderfully funny, while nearly all work well in vaudeville fashion, especially for Kilbride and Main, with their portrayals and timing often borrowing from Laurel and Hardy. Sight gags are in generous supply, frequently presented apace so that the viewer must be alert for them amid the general hilarity. Richard Long acts as Tom Kettle, eldest of the brood, and he and his fiancee Kim (Meg Randall), both regulars of the series, are of particular assistance to their elders in this affair. The cast is well stocked with excellent character performers, notable among them being Martell as the leader of Munger's henchmen, along with Jim Backus as another bandit, and also present are Ray Collins, Bert Freed, Ellen Corby, Emory Parnell and Olan Soule. Special photography by David Horsley adds impact to a comedy that is completely light-hearted, one of the best of the Kettle series.",1128211200,,2316,4.910714285714286
7839054,4,6303103626,"Ma and Pa Kettle were first introduced in The Egg and I, as incidental characters to the story.  A humorous interpretation of ""country folk"" at a time when our nation was surging ahead technologically,  these films provide a poignant glimpse of this transition period.  Pa  Kettle displays penchant for winning sweepstakes (a true underdog and  underacheiver, this is the only financial contribution he seems to provide  for his family of 17).  Having already won a modern home in The Further  Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle, Pa now wins a trip for two to New York City  paid for by the Bubble-Ola Soda Company.  The usual series of screwball  mishaps color this movie with a refreshing (by modern standards) bolt of  humor.  First Pa finds a babysitter for the children back in Cape Flattery,  Washington...who turns out to be a notorious gangster from New York passing  himself off as a poet.  When Pa goes to deliver a package to the gangsters  for his new found friend he finds himself entangled with the police, the  gangsters, and a corporate climber mistaking him for Kettle the underwear  magnate.  The simplicity of the Kettles working within the context of the  modern urbanized environment allow us to laugh at both sides.  This film in  particular is among the Kettle best, and among the essentials within the 10  titles.",962409600,25,1333,4.848214285714286
