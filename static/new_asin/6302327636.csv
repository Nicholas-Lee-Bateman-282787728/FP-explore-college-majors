7824348,5,6302327636,"This is one of my favorite Bowery Boys film. Still offered on VHS tape. Who still buys VHS tape? Don't even see the machines for sale. Anyway, Amazon and all Bowery Boy fans let's nicely ask the studio to move twenty years into the future and offer this great old Bowery Boys meet Old Dark House movie on ""DVD"".
As a side note a great version (remastered) is available on Warner Brothers Archive Collection ""The Bowery Boys Volume Two"" Spook Busters is the first movie in this 12 Volume set. Every movie is crystal clear with perfect sound. At this writing it is hovering around $40.00. For those only looking for a very entertaining  ""Old Dark House spoof movie"" please Warner Brothers offer this very fun movie on DVD...",1448064000,,722,4.596899224806202
7824349,4,6302327636,"Spook Busters features the Bowery Boys; several of the members are Dead End Kids all grown up. The leader of the gang is Slip (Leo Gorcey), a fella with a big personality. He manages the struggling exterminating business the boys have going, and when they get their first job, he jumps at the chance. Unfortunately, the house is rumored to be haunted, and it is, but not by ghosts. Some scientists are doing some secretive work inside- work that they don't want to be discovered.

Sach (Huntz Hall) acts as the clown, constantly getting into trouble. Gabe also provides the beautiful girl in the form of his wife, a French beauty (Tanis Chandler). The gags and the story of this film read like those from a short subject, but there are plenty of things to run the time to feature length. Sometimes it gets slow and predictable, but the personalities in the gang make it fun.",1173830400,,874,4.602564102564102
7824350,3,6302327636,"In 1946 the East Side Kids would change their name, for the final time, to the Bowery boys as Leo Gorcey would now become Muggs Mahoney as the leader of the gang.  With the change the boys films would now become almost completely, three-stooges inspired, slapstick romps with little of the gritty drama of their East Side/Dead End kids days.

Spook Busters is the perfect example of a film that plays out like an extended Three Stooges short.  The boys have just graduated college...well...actually they graduate from exterminator school and become professional exterminators.  They get a call to clean up the pests at an old spooky house so it can be sold.  Naturally nothing is that easy as the boys find a mad doctor and a gang of henchman are hiding out in the house and try their best to scare the boys off.  Stealing another page from the Stooges, the mad doctor wants to put Sache's brain in th head of a gorilla.  There are plenty of comedic spooky moments and sight gags in the movie and it's a fun comedy horror film.",1109289600,4,1027,4.548913043478261
7824351,4,6302327636,"When my brother and I were kids, our dad always watched Bowery Boys movies with us.  Being, himself, a poor streets kid from Scranton, PA during pretty much the same era, he seemed to really connect with the flicks.  This particular movie I remember enjoying thirty years ago, as I do today.  It mixes the typical high jinx of all the Boys' movies with some innocuous monster movie spookiness.  Great nostalgic fun for the adult, and great silly, G-rated fun for the kids.",1044835200,6,472,4.650602409638554
