8447271,1,B004XNNUZ2,This movie is awful.  Don't waste your time.,1499644800,,44,4.5
8447272,3,B004XNNUZ2,"Not very realistic, although the acting was very good. Facial expressions, and comments were good.  The premise of a man (Finbar) just going away was disturbing. When he is found and hearing about his Mother's pain of his unknown location, (her even thinking he was dead,)  the response of Finbar is oddly indifferent.. Then he follows with another perplexing move. There is no explanation of why Finbar left, or why he chose to stay away as long as he did. Not knowing why some of the characters did certain things in the film, make me give a 3 star rating.",1483401600,2,558,4.57
8447273,4,B004XNNUZ2,Once again you can see Jonny's amazing talent here. Finbar's quest is interesting to watch & relate to.,1458345600,,103,4.777777777777778
8447274,4,B004XNNUZ2,"well, it is a friendship story and its somehow touching, but i find it lil bit frustrating cause it ends with no conclusion.. leave me hanging with big question mark in my head.  Yea, may be a man's life is one long journey.. and maybe this is the part of the journey of those two boys.. though all the drama, time and devotion which Finbar's friend put into wasn't lead to any type of specific answer.  Its poetic other than dramatic.  Young Jonathan Rhys Meyers is brilliant in this movie, so I give 4 stars for that.",1403308800,5,519,4.329896907216495
8447275,5,B004XNNUZ2,"I'm not going to say this movie is fantastic, but JRM is so adorable in it!  He also speaks in his real accent!  If you love Jonny, you won't be sorry!",1400803200,5,151,3.838709677419355
8447276,4,B004XNNUZ2,"A couple of reveiwers mentioned the quality of the product not being up to par, as it's a re-pressing. I wanted the DVD so badly, as it's Colin Farrell's first appearance on film, he was still attending Gaity Drama school at the time, and as an extra did not get a mention in the cast, I know Amazon stands behind it's products so I purchased it. The quality was fine, no problems and I enjoyed seeing the cheeky youthful Colin greatly!",1345939200,4,436,4.395061728395062
8447277,1,B004XNNUZ2,"My copy did the same exact thing as the other reviewer's did. It kept freezing and jumping every few minutes throughout. I returned it and explained the issue to Amazon, and was sent another copy - which had the same exact issues throughout. This Film Four MOD program is a good idea, and I'm glad that Americans are able to purchase British films unavailable through other channels in this country, and I don't even mind the occasional lesser quality transfer when it comes to older films, but they should at least work properly. This film and Baby Of Macon have defects in the authoring of the DVDs, and until somebody on Film Four's end fixes this, Amazon will keep selling defective DVDs.",1312848000,3,692,4.680327868852459
