2304226,5,B0009NSCU8,"I was a big fan of this series will working overseas.  I could access the BBC television feeds and enjoyed Chef!, Monty Python and another must see but little known series called ""Allo Allo"".  I agree with many of the other reviews found here about the series, seasons one and two are superior, it is a shame that season three fall short.  There was a major change, director, writers, some characters and the format of the production in mass doomed what was a great and witty series. I can recommend season one and two without question, but stay away from season three unless you need to see the contrasting decline.",1212537600,10,616,4.581818181818182
2304227,5,B0009NSCU8,"I have watched this so many times, I can quote it by heart. Lenny Henry makes Gordon Ramsay look like a kindergarten kid .... and Lenny is actually funny!",1202601600,,154,4.344827586206897
2304228,5,B0009NSCU8,One of my two favourite BBC shows (the other is Vicar of Dibley). Lenny Henry (Chef) is absolutely hilarious!,1199750400,,109,4.7894736842105265
2304229,5,B0009NSCU8,Another excellent British comedy which makes me wonder how Americans can settle for Seinfeld or Friends...I'm going to buy the entire series today!,1171238400,4,147,5.434782608695652

2304303,5,B0009NSCU8,"Watched this years ago, and then it disappeared! Lenny Henry is super hilarious, playing the ""finest"" chef in England, possibly the world! It's British humor at it's best. I wish he would've continued this series until...forever!!!! But since that's not possible, I'll take what I can get.",1403136000,4,289,5.170212765957447
2304304,1,B0009NSCU8,"From the irritating theme song to the complete lack of humor, this is the most awful example of British ""comedy"" that I've ever had the misfortune to experience.  It is a rare occurrence that I have nothing good to say about a comedy series,  and it may be unfair in this case since I didn't actually watch the whole DVD.  Part way through the third episode, I couldn't tolerate it any more.  I had read reviews likening this show to the brilliant ""Fawlty Towers"", but in my opinion those reviews were overly generous and possibly tainted with the predispostion that if the show is British it is innately superior to other comedy series.  The characters are one-dimensional and have not been given any qualities with which the viewer may connect, so ultimately it's like we are viewing a bunch of noisy goldfish: we don't care about them, but we can still see and hear them.  And that, my friends, is unnecessary.",1398729600,,913,4.6397515527950315
2304305,5,B0009NSCU8,I love British comedies and this one does not disappoint:  Lenny Henry is absolutely hysterical and this series is intelligently written and performed.,1376784000,,151,5.565217391304348
2304306,5,B0009NSCU8,I bought this for my nephews 20th b-day.  He wants to be a chef.  I love Chef and all other British sit-coms so I thought he would like it.,1373155200,,139,3.7586206896551726
2304307,5,B0009NSCU8,"I have never worked in a kitchen but having seen Gordon Ramsey loose it on camera, I can only imagine what might go on behind closed doors. The first season of Chef! is outstanding, hilarious and contains some of the funniest bites I have ever seen/heard.",1356825600,2,255,4.565217391304348
2304308,5,B0009NSCU8,"This is the first season of ""Chef"", and introduces us to uppity chef de cuisine Gareth Blackstock and various people in his life, namely his wife, Janice (a brilliant and witty woman who knows how to handle her flighty husband),his kitchen staff at the
upscale Chateau Anglais, and many others. Hilarious and worth watching over and over again.",1354233600,2,344,4.948275862068965
2304309,5,B0009NSCU8,"The dvd set arrived in excellent condition and very promptly. This is one of my favorite British comedy series. If you have ever worked in a commercial kitchen, you have got to see it. Can't wait to get the next season.",1351468800,4,219,4.365853658536586
2304310,4,B0009NSCU8,"If you like Frazer, You'll love this. It made me smile from start to finish. The chef's wife was a charicter that developed as the series when on.",1346630400,,146,4.25
2304351,5,B0009NSCU8,"Pay no attention to the one star review. This is a very funny show especially if you've ever worked in a restaurant. Garrett is a typical chef - an arrogant, self important S.O.B. - but very funny. Him calling the wait staff morons is how most chefs feel - believe me I'm a waiter (moron). The rest of the staff are typical of a high end restaurant. I hope you enjoy this show - season 3 is not as funny but still watchable- as much as I did. Doug",1335571200,2,447,4.033707865168539
2304352,5,B0009NSCU8,"Just as his character Gareth Blackstock would aerate a Malbec before serving, comic mastermind Lenny Henry stands back in this episode of Chef! and gives the supporting cast room to breathe.

Gareth's two-star Michelin restaurant, Le Chateau Anglais, receives an unexpected visit from his father (Jamaican comic legend, Oliver Samuels), and dear old dad is not impressed with the French cuisine his son is serving. When Dad goads Gareth into accepting a challenge which must be seen to be believed, only under-appreciated line-cook Everton Stonehead (the delightful Roger Griffiths) has the ability to save the day.

A five star episode chock-full of i-rey laughs.

*****",1316131200,4,671,5.371428571428571
2304353,5,B0009NSCU8,"Serious profession, indeed.

Gareth Blackstock (Lenny Henry) is the best at what he does, and what he does is run the kitchen of Oxford's fictional Le Chateau Anglais. Gareth is overbearing, rude, pompous, and prone to disparaging outbursts aimed at his long-suffering kitchen staff, but underneath Gareth's brusque exterior lies a (reluctantly) sympathetic boss.

The series high-point arrives with the episode 'Rice and Peas' (season 1, episode 6) when Gareth's mercurial father (played by Jamaican legend Oliver Samuels) swoops in to steal the show and doesn't relinquish the reins until the episode's closing credits.

A word to the wise: season 3 sees the program turn into a studio sitcom, and even the talented Mr. Henry can't save it from run of the mill rote.",1316131200,8,768,5.17741935483871
2304354,5,B0009NSCU8,"This is a fantastic show. Lenny Henry really shines. I first saw this on its short run on my local public television station, and I really appreciate amazon prime carrying this and a few of the other classics like ""Vicar of Dibley.""",1314144000,5,232,4.5476190476190474
2304355,5,B0009NSCU8,"Yes,it took us sometime to realize how funny and smart this series is. Its fast and very sophisticated(so put the subtiltles on).
Once you get into it, you are hooked.
Our family can watch it again and again, just like Seinfeld and Vicar of Dibley.
BRILLIANT.",1304726400,2,259,4.6521739130434785
2304356,2,B0009NSCU8,"""Chef- Season 1""  is a British comedy.  Overall it has the same theme as many of American cooking competitions.  The Chef in charge of incompetent underlings shouts and slams down dishes and pans.  If you like to laugh at striving cooks being humiliated it may appeal to you.  There are some quieter comedy moments, but overall it is just offensive to the senses.",1296259200,,363,4.698412698412699
2304357,1,B0009NSCU8,"I purchased the Chef based on the reviews that I read.  None of the reviews included ""canned laughter"" and had I known that, it would not have been a program I would have watched or a DVD that I would have bought. This is an AWFUL show! The actors are corny and in need of lessons, but if you enjoy a program with canned laughter, this is the show for you.  We love the BBC shows and have many of them but this was a real dud.",1281916800,3,426,3.8850574712643677
2304358,4,B0009NSCU8,"The show is primarily about an imperious chef and his staff, running a kitchen in an upscale French cuisine restaurant. The pompous, ""Britain's finest"" Chef frequently bursts out in eloquent oratory, mainly on how low his lowlife employees are. The Chef is a perfectionist, to the extent that he will ignore the law by buying illegal, unpasteurized Stilton cheese to get the taste he wants. Then there is his beautiful wife, trying to reign-in his excessive spending on ingredients and feeling somewhat neglected. What is a bit unusual is that with one minor exception the show does not involve wine.
The writing is witty, engaging and sophisticated. It derives its humor from plausible situations, rather than stuff like sticking pencils in your nose to get a laugh, and it does not use profanity or vulgarity. The episodes are amusing, there are many funny moments, but you will not fall out of your chair laughing. To those more familiar with the culinary arts, there are more humorous moments in the preparation of certain dishes.
One thing the show does, it makes you want to cook, or at least eat something really delicious. Also, the people with high blood pressure who put salt on their food only in their dreams, may find the show helpful, as the Chef presents a most compelling and rational case against salting food. After watching that, one may feel perfectly fine not using salt and liking it.",1247788800,3,1406,4.8625
2304359,5,B0009NSCU8,The Chef Series One was incredibly funny.  I'm going to buy the other sets. The writing on this show is wonderful and the actors are superb. You won't regret owning this copy.,1234828800,,175,4.46875
