6228813,4,B00HV9EA8Q,"3.5 stars, rounded up due to Jewel Staite and weirdness factor. Make no mistake, this is a romcom. It appears to be Not Rated, but it could probably pass as R... not surprisingly (given the movie's title) there are a ton of sex scenes, but they are included for humor and don't reveal the body parts that seem to upset some folks (i.e., genitals, female nipples).

PROs
 Actors. Given that most of the characters were caricatures rather than plausible people, the actors did well with what they were given. Sci-fi darling Jewel Staite (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B004XUMMFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis/dp/B004WJT5H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis</a>) is the protagonist, and supernatural serial star Natalie Brown (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B009T3AGVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>&nbsp;[North America], Bitten,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strain/dp/B0112OT5QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strain</a>) appears all too briefly for a couple of simulated sex scenes. The actors have numerous credits to their names, so if this film doesn't work for you it's not from a lack of thespian talent.
 What you get is an expanded romantic comedy (i.e., it doesn't focus on one couple, it focuses on several couples and the dissolution of their barriers), which is good because if you find one or two of the couples particularly unpalatable, the movie isn't necessarily ruined for you.
 The story moves along at a good clip and only gets bogged down by some of the generic romcom scenes towards the end.
 The humor. There are several scenes that will make you laugh even if you are wanting to pan the movie. I can see how this Could be nearly non-stop laughter for many people; I was satisfied with an average of one laugh every five minutes.

CONs
 The humor. Yeah, I know I just said it's a PRO, but it's also a CON because it isn't consistent in quality. Some of it seems written for teens or other people who are new to sex. Some of the lines will appeal to folks who've had very few partners, other lines will appeal to those who've had many. It's a crapshoot.
 Are people really like this? Truth is stranger than fiction, but these people are pretty strange. Maybe small towns really are like Garrison Keillor portrays them?
 All things considered, it's somewhat predictable when characters start pairing off.
 I *love* indie films, but often the music is extremely obnoxious. This one features several artists who I would like to go see perform simply for the opportunity to smash an instrument atop their pretentious, invariably white craniums. Really, music supervisors of indie films need to get out of the habit of choosing crap music with lyrics that have absolutely nothing to do with the picture... yeah, I know it has to do with $$, but even AI-generated music would be an improvement over a soundtrack with lyrics.

My favorite line: ""And they say that it takes a village to raise a child..."" (context is everything, you'll have to watch)
Moral of the story: Everyone has essentially the same face when they achieve orgasm.
Final thoughts: A happy ending, if that's what you want in a movie. The plot is about a writer who will be in hot water if she doesn't write a book on very short notice, and I can't help but think this movie was written under the same pressure.",1463184000,13,3566,5.524770642201835
6228814,1,B00HV9EA8Q,I thought it was stupid - I drunk-ordered it by mistake when I first got my Firestick.,1481760000,,86,4.117647058823529
6228815,5,B00HV9EA8Q,"Back in the 50's, the British made a number of modest, charming and gentle comedies (often with Peter Sellers) that weren't LOL funny but kept a smile on your face throughout.  Later, Bill Forsyth (Local Hero) managed the same effect. Delightfully humane comedies, with a tinge of weirdness. Now the Canadians have produced several more, e.g. A Dog's Breakfast, and Y.P.F. (which this very much resembles).  And , for trivia buffs, the latter all have major links to Stargate:  Atlantis.
  This is, in part, a modest ribbing of small-town life, but is more about relationships (with no treacle). The simulated sex is played for humor, and the nudity is contextual and limited (and if that's a body double in Jewel's big nude scene,  I don't want to know that.  Ever).  Like the other films mentioned, it is pleasantly satisfying
  If you have been deterred by Amazon's BD-R warning, in case BD-Rs are as inferior to BDs as DVD-Rs are to DVDs, don't be. I haven't seen a BD-R before, and this one has a dark label side which  makes it hard to see the data side, but the latter does appear much darker than a standard Blu-ray.  There is no indication on the box or disk that this is anything but a Blu-ray, and my Oppo reads it as a standard Blu-ray. The bit rate is between 20 and 30 Mb/sec, like an ordinary BD. The picture is crisp and detailed (and the film has high production values for a small, indie film), and looks beautiful on a big screen. Indeed, if this really is a BD-R, I see why they blocked them from the North American market; you could record far better ones off satellite than you could buy from the studios (with all that annoying garbage like forced previews and time bars, which this disk doesn't have).  I don't buy DVD-Rs because they are standard def visual hash, but I won't hesitate to buy BD-Rs if they all look as good as this one.",1481155200,,1860,4.5

6228824,5,B00HV9EA8Q,I went into this expecting a cheesy B movie and found my expectations completely blown away. It's a great story about how people aren't exactly who they appear to be and appearances may be deceiving. Don't like the word ORGY scare you off; it's hilarious.,1470614400,2,255,4.688888888888889

8636310,5,B00HV9EA8Q,"Started out pretty slow, and if you pay attention to what is happening - you'll understand why Orgy is in the title, and laugh quite often as the story moves forward, backwards, trying and trying to succeed - it may not be the greatest movie - but in the end, it all makes sense and if you're like me - you'll smile feeling although it started a bit slow, it was so totally ridiculous, silly, dramatic, and at times romantic that you'll be glad you watched. Oh, and not a movie for when kids are around... LOL (some nudity and situations)",1531872000,,538,4.336633663366337
8636311,3,B00HV9EA8Q,it's a bit silly. not exactly what I expected but I guess it's ok.,1529107200,,66,3.7857142857142856

8636313,3,B00HV9EA8Q,"I think most of the people who down-voted are mad because they were looking for porn and didn't get it. Getting turned on is not the point of this movie. It's a goofy look at how awkward adults can be about identity, relationships and sex. There are a few laugh out loud funny moments, and some others that are at least smile-out-loud. Mostly it's just that sort of sweet, lovable rom com stuff, like when the two guys left out of the orgy decide to ""make lemonade"" and get it on. Maybe the characters don't totally stand up to scrutiny, but at least it's not as boring and plastic as the standard Hollywood versions.",1522454400,,617,4.421052631578948
8636314,5,B00HV9EA8Q,This movie was fantastic! Great one liners and the plot never got super cheesy. Fine holiday fun!,1516752000,,97,4.764705882352941
8636315,5,B00HV9EA8Q,"Cute little rom-com with a twist.  Probably should have given it a 4, but I have a strong Jewel Staite desire bias and Katharine Isabelle is hot sexy fun. Polly (Tommie-Amber Pirie) definitely appealed to my geek side. A bit silly, but so are almost all rom-coms.",1511827200,,263,4.595744680851064
8636316,5,B00HV9EA8Q,"This was great, I do feel for Kathrine Isabell though, it seems like no matter the movie they try to get her as nude as possible. Loved her character though.",1504224000,,157,4.266666666666667
8636317,5,B00HV9EA8Q,I liked Jewel Staite's acting in this challenging role.,1490659200,,55,5.222222222222222
8636318,3,B00HV9EA8Q,"This is a funny little Canadian movie about a relationship advice columnist, Cassie (Jewel Staite), who returns to the small town where she grew up and - you guessed it - plans an orgy. Cassie hopes the project will revitalize her career by making it the subject of her next book, but the old wounds it reopens and secrets it reveals complicate matters. It has some stock characters (the nymphomaniac, the basement-dwelling nerd, etc.) who make things predictable at times, and with a conclusion that isn't as outrageous as the movie intends, it doesn't quite...umm...stick the landing. All the same, in spite of its raunchiness, it manages to be a sweet, funny and heartfelt romantic comedy.",1487548800,,692,4.974137931034483
8636319,3,B00HV9EA8Q,"this is an ok comedy. the sex scenes were not erotic per say except for the beginning of the movie and the one with Jewel Staite.
. as you had Lauren Lee Smith in here do sex scenes that were not erotic so that would definitely meant that someone owed her a big favor or the scenes were meant to be comedic rather than soft core porn.(or in Lee's case hard core). the extended or deleted scenes were much hotter. even the bloopers were a bit hotter than the movie itself.

if it were to see a scantly clad Jewel Staite getting laid I would give it five stars. hell I would give it 10 stars. but the script was bad as well as the editing of the movie. there was not enough to really get involved with the characters unless you saw the deleted scenes. as seeing the movie only will not really make sense per say or at least have fleshed out characters (no pun intended).",1483920000,3,868,4.166666666666667
