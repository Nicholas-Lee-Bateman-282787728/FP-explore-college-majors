I just wanted to add my 'Well Done' to those who have already voiced their appreciation for the fine performance by these guys. This is a quality recording that speaks well of the producers and editors as well Four Play themselves. This is the only thing that will make a 14 month old hold still for a while.

Now this new one features Larry Carlton on guitar replacing Lee Ritenour. And after about tewnty years the smoothjazz group is still retaining it's musical edge. All the way to the contient of Africa. The music sounds great with songs like Bali Run,Galaxia and Amazing Grace. The playing of Harvey Mason on drums,Bob James on keyboards,Nathan East on bass and vocals and Larry Carlton on guitar. Makes a great life perormance for all to enjoy. My only complaint is that there are no special features on this DVD.A behind the scene interview with the group would have been nice. Or maybe a behind the scenes look at the making of the show and the trip to Africa.

To make this short, I was astounded at what I witnessed. Fourplay used their smooth jazz repetoire as a mere platform to explore opportunities to create and excite. The juxtaposition of music with a great groove and on-the-edge musical adventure featuring in-depth interplay between players and virtuosity of improversation left me hungry for more.
I purchased a CD of their music and listened to it on the way home. To my displeasure, I found the recordings with some exception to revert back to the smooth jazz that I, franky, have slept through in the past.

And yes I'll concede Lee has a bag of electronics that helps him get his sound - but isn't that part of his genius?

Harvey is superb.  I'm a drummer and can appreciate his talent.  His solid groove and timing are trademarks.  He doesn't have the Gadd licks or the Weckle fluidity but wow - what a great player!

Bob is mellowing as the years pass.  I have so much of his discography.  I always hoped he'd pull off Kenny Baron or Benny Green licks on the keys - but then again, that isn't Bob James.  Bob has to be one of THE most tasty key men on the planet.  Just the right note at the right time. His creative prowess is impressive.

Then we have Nate the Cat! This dude is - well - wow!  What can you say? I gotta say in my book he is DA bass brutha!  The Bro can sing, play and whistle!  His playing is tasty and never overbearing.

3153542,5,B001675YL6,"I went to see them at Blue Note Nagoya. Then I watched this DVD in Capetown. Their performance was better on this DVD than Nagoya. I guess this is because they spent 5 days in Tokyo and the show I went was their first show at Nagoya. This show in Capetown has much enthusiasm in their performance. And it shows their relief from their world tour ending at this wonderful town. It is such fun to see these cats playing each instrument flawlessly and impeccably. If you like Fourplay, just buy this.

This concert was held in the city where i was born and even though i no longer live in South Africa, it will always have that extra special significance for me.",1247011200,,327,4.655172413793103
3388038,5,B001675YL6,This was a wonderful wonderful event!!! So cool watching them play! I have been a hugh hugh fan from their inception and this is the net best thing to being there.,1245628800,,163,4.290322580645161
3388039,5,B001675YL6,"I went to see them at Blue Note Nagoya. Then I watched this DVD in Capetown. Their performance was better on this DVD than Nagoya. I guess this is because they spent 5 days in Tokyo and the show I went was their first show at Nagoya. This show in Capetown has much enthusiasm in their performance. And it shows their relief from their world tour ending at this wonderful town. It is such fun to see these cats playing each instrument flawlessly and impeccably. If you like Fourplay, just buy this. Highly recommended.",1244505600,,517,4.51063829787234
3388040,3,B001675YL6,"I am a huge Fourplay fan, however this concert was lackluster at best. It had its high points over all it was very generic. I guess I was hoping that he concert was better than the CD which was the worst they have every done.",1244332800,3,225,4.022222222222222
