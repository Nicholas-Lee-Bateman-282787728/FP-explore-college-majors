3921828,5,B002FG9N4Q,"E1 Entertainment (formerly Koch Home Video) partnered last year with the Archive of American Television to release some extremely rare television shows from their archives on home video. Nearly all of these shows have not been seen by the public since they were broadcast over 50 years ago! Thanks to both early videotape and Kinescopes (live TV broadcasts preserved on film) we are able to re-live what were originally one-time performances. This DVD is one such event.

The Barbara Stanwyck Show was one of many ""anthology"" shows (Four Star Playhouse and The Loretta Young Show were others) that featured original half-hour stories (comedy, drama, suspense) usually (but not always) starring the shows' host. Because there were less commercials then the actually story ran about 27-minutes.

This DVD collection (marked Volume 1 - so we may get more I hope) contains 15 episodes (including the pilot). Each has been listed by an earlier reviewer so I won't repeat them here. Stanwyck did not appear in EVER show and it is comedian Milton Berle who helms the black comedy ""Dear Charlie"" - which would have been a perfect episode on Alfred Hitchcock Presents. These shows were shot on film before airing and the prints are superb.

I remember watching a few of these when originally aired and even remember one of the episodes. What id didn't remember was how many times Stanwyck plays a liberated and strong female role as the owner of a business. There are at least three here in which she takes on that role, long before ""women's liberation"".  One episode in particular - ""Daragon By The Tail"" - has lost much of its relevance because of the end to the cold war and the threat of Chinese Communism. But that's a minor gripe.

With excellent packaging and high production values, this set will allow younger generations to understand the high quality of American TV before ""reality TV"" and the need to pay for HBO to see quality scripts  and quality acting on TV.

3921829,3,B002FG9N4Q,"This gets three stars from me because it is a rarity. I never saw it, it was produced years before I was. Dated TV fodder with lame, stagey scripts. B-Grade, aging Hollywood movie hag, Barbara Stanwyck is carefully photographed to help hide her 50+ visage. Cool that she co-produced this short-lived show. Anthology type shows were all the rage in the early '60s (eg. Playhouse 90, The Untouchables, The Twilight Zone etc.)
Stanwyck's TV show didn't fly because others were better. Maybe she was broadcasted opposite a western TV show. Go figure? Her mid to late 60s western series, ""Big Valley"" was a hit.
The opening credits are vintage Hollywood style with an announcer and TV AD built-in presentation. Love that. A glamorous Stanwyck to the the right of the screen; coiffed,gloved and gowned looking like a drag queen! It is as dated as Lorretta Young's old show. Filmed by Desilu!",1262908800,,885,4.867549668874172
3921830,5,B002FG9N4Q,"Barbara Stanwyck was a class act unto herself. She could be great at comedy, drama, and melodrama as she proved time and again over her long film and T.V. Career.  But here in this DVD of her first Television series from 1961 she shines like a rare star sapphire.
  I won't go into a list of the shows or who the quest stars are since my fellow reviewers have covered that aspect all too well. What I will tell you about this wonderful surprise from Miss Stanwyck and company is that each half hour show is superbly mounted as if it were a feature film. Great lighting, direction, acting, music, story, the entire resources of Desilu where thrown at the show and with great results. These treasures are mini movies that pack a wallop as few other shows of the period did. Some are ahead of their time in fact. That they could pack so much story and drama into each 24 minute episode just leaves me astounded. A short story can be just as compelling here as a 90 minute feature.
  A brilliant and fun collection that you can revisit again and again and well worth spending the bucks on.",1262736000,6,1085,4.378109452736318
3921831,4,B002FG9N4Q,"A fan of Stanwyck since I was a child and saw the Big Valley then grew up to see  her classic films including Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers--this show is suprisingly contemporary with excellent scripts, surprising guest stars and Stanwyck's emotional range on vivid display.

And I have to say whoever did her wardrobe surely deserved accolades as well, the gowns are magnificent at the beginning of the show and her wardrobe for the ""Little Jo"" episodes is distractingly sexy.",1261267200,6,513,5.023529411764706
3921832,5,B002FG9N4Q,"For fans of Barbara Stanwyck, this 3 disc DVD set is like finding a vein of pure gold in a mine of lost treasures. Included are 16 episodes of the BARBARA STANWYCK SHOW which aired during the 1960-1961 television season, plus an unaired pilot. Although the series lasted only a single season, it earned Stanwyck the 1961 Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Series"". After viewing these DVDs, it's easy to see why she won.

Stanwyck stars in 16 of the 17 episodes. The exception is one in which a sleezy Milton Berle plays Romeo to two old maid sisters, scheming to become the heir in both their wills. The shows starring Stanwyck fit nicely with the roles she played on the big screen. In the majority of them, she plays powerful, sucessful women - female executives, wealthy wives, a psychiatrist, even an atomic physicist. In several, her career causes problems with her family life. She was certainly not afraid to play unsympathetic characters. Her only repeated role is that of Hong Kong importer-exporter Josephine Little in two of these episodes.

Two of the programs are westerns. In the first, she is Charles Bickford's mail-order bride. The marriage gets complicated when her first husband in the form of Gerald Mohr shows up. In the second, Barbara is the wife of the town marshall. She has to nurse her sick child and protect her home against a man who has come to town to kill her husband.

The brightest gems of the collection are the ones closest to film noir. Disc 1 opens with her playing the wife of a deputy sheriff. She is handcuffed to punk killer Vic Morrow trying to get him to the nearest town and into jail. Will the punk escape? Will she get him into the slammer? Will she make him cry ""mama""? In the terrific episode ""Night Visitor"", saucy Julie London invades Stanwyck's home and with the help of her boyfriend Michael Ansara, who is also Barbara's butler, takes her hostage in an effort to force her to open her safe and hand over the stacks of cash inside. Delicious! ""Confessions"" is a TV cousin to DOUBLE INDEMNITY. When Barbara walks through his door, third rate lawyer Lee Marvin sees his big chance to get the girl, frame her husband for murder, and end up with a bundle of money. It's ""straight down the line"" one more time, with deadly results, of course.

All the programs are crisply written and directed. In her introductions, Stanwyck makes a point of  mentioning who wrote and directed each episode. This collection is also a reminder of how much television lost with the disappearance of the half-hour dramatic anthology series. This collection is solid gold.",1259971200,26,2625,4.697826086956522
3921833,5,B002FG9N4Q,"The great Barbara Stanwyck, on nearly everyone's list of the five best film actresses of alltime, starred in this long-unseen one-season anthology series for NBC in 1960-61, which was a critic's darling but apparently did not pull in high enough ratings for the network to renew it for a second season.  Stanwyck would go on to win the Emmy award for ""Best Actress in a Dramatic Series"" at the end of the season and the show quietly slipped away into TV history after that although for decades it has been the subject of much lament by Stanwyck buffs at the frustration at not having the chance to see the acclaimed program.  Now almost 50 years after it's initial run, THE BARBARA STANWYCK SHOW has at last been unearthed! Sadly, a number of episodes are to date not known to survive (most alarming is the fact that this set has only 15 of the 36 episodes produced although the accompanying booklet says a ""volume two"" set is in the works, it seems apparent that at this point most of the remaining episodes have yet to be found.)  Several of the episodes here are in less than pristine shape, with a few scenes with film scratches or imperfect picture quality but one suspects in many cases the producers of this set were working with mostly 16mm film prints and most likely single copies of most of them.  The print quality generally is very good to excellent however and let's just be grateful we have these considering the unknown status of most of the other episodes.

Barbara Stanwyck proves again and again in these episodes she well deserved that Emmy.  These little 25-minute dramas may have to use economy to tell their stories (the endings are often a bit rushed) but most of the episodes are highly satisfying.  Stanwyck's roles run the gamut to fashion tycoon to brillant physicist to upperclass housewife and, as in her film roles, Stanwyck is always believable and natural.  She also has a number of excellent costars including Ralph Bellamy, Charles Bickford, Gene Raymond, Ellen Drew, Elizabeth Patterson, and Lee Marvin.  There's also the excellent character actress Doris Packer, a very familiar face on television during this era, giving Babs a run for her money as her domineering mother-in-law in THE SECRET OF MRS. RANDALL, my favorite episode of the lot.  There are lots of other notable supporting players although it is disappointing the Anna May Wong who appears in one episode is not the famous star of the 1930's but another actress who used the same name.

Barbara Stanwyck a few years later did enjoy a big tv success with the western THE BIG VALLEY which won her a second Emmy and ran for four years.  Nevertheless, I can't help but feel THE BARBARA STANWYCK SHOW was the highlight of Stanwyck's small screen career and I can't wait for ""volume two"".",1258502400,20,2783,4.7272727272727275
3921834,5,B002FG9N4Q,I remember seeing reruns of two or three episodes of this series about 20 years ago on an independent TV station and truly enjoyed them. I'm looking forward to the DVD collection. Barbara Stanwyck was a fine actor!,1252368000,2,214,4.657894736842105
3921835,5,B002FG9N4Q,"Originally named ""The Barbara Stanwyck Theatre"", this anthology series starring the four-time Best Actress Oscar nominee made its debut on September 19, 1960, on the NBC television network.  Renamed ""The Barbara Stanwyck Show"", the series ran for only one season, despite the fact that its host and star received the Emmy Award as Outstanding Actress in a Television Series (Lead).  A total of 36 episodes aired, but the show never went into syndication following its initial run; thus, it has been virtually unseen by the general public for almost half a century.

This eagerly anticipated DVD collection includes 15 of the series' first 22 half-hour episodes, plus the never televised pilot episode.  Missing are the first four episodes: ""The Mink Coat"", ""Good Citizen"", ""Discreet Deception"", and ""The Seventh Miracle""; episode 10, ""We Are the Women Who Wait""; episode 12, ""No One""; and episode 13, ""The Cornerstone"".

The search to locate, preserve and restore the long lost gems offered in this collection has taken years of hard work and dedication on the part of the copyright owner and a handful of determined archivists, assisted by loyal fans of the supremely talented Miss Stanwyck.  Their efforts are especially appreciated by happy viewers like me, who have waited decades for the chance to see one of their favorite actresses in her first, acclaimed weekly television series.

3921841,5,B002FG9N4Q,This first season set of short TV stories features (in many cases) Barbara Stanwyck. The stories are provocative and interesting - a real treat to watch. Ms. Stanwyck introduces each story and is looking as glamorous as ever. There is no TV programming available like this show in today's television. It is a very nice set to have in your TV series collection. I plan on buying Volume 2.,1399766400,3,387,4.6231884057971016
3921842,4,B002FG9N4Q,"Stanwyck never did a bad acting job in her life, but the other thing this has going for it is well over 1/2 the episodes were directed by Jacques Tourneur (& a couple by Robert Florey). Much better than I expected. My only complaints are:
1. The volume varies a bit too much from show to show
2. The Milton Berle episode that Stanwyck sits out is pretty bad; it's an obvious take off on Arsenic & Old Lace (with the roles partially reversed) & is almost embarrassing to watch.

I did not see this when originally broadcast, & it's been a pleasant surprise. While the quality varies, at least half of the episodes are superb. Some parts of the negatives are a bit damaged. I don't THINK this is a Kinescope; the picture quality is better than that in most places.",1395532800,,762,4.366197183098592
3921843,5,B002FG9N4Q,"Barbara Stanwyck was one of the top stars in Hollywood and at one time was the highest paid female star. Like many of her contemporaries in the movie business, she saw the possibilities of extending her career in the relatively new medium of television. Her first attempt to break into television with a series of her own was this series which consisted of an anthology of shows, each with different characters and stories (with the exception of two installments that featured the same character and setting), often featuring other Hollywood guest stars and up-and-coming new actors on their way to stardom.

This DVD set includes half of the episodes of the show on three DVDs along with a booklet of background information and episode outlines.

All but one of the shows in this set stars Stanwyck in the lead. The quality of each individual episode varies slightly based on the writing and story type, but overall is of a high standard. Stanwyck is at her best in the stories that feature a strong-willed woman similar to her role of Victoria Barkley in her iconic television show Big Valley, as in the first episode on the DVD ""The Key to the Killer,"" but she is also believable in the more soapy, romantic stories as well such as in ""The Sisters.""

Although her first series only lasted one season, it won Stanwyck an Emmy Award as Best Actress. Her acceptance of the award is included as a bonus feature as is the never-aired pilot episode for the series.

Recommended, especially if you enjoy playing ""Spot the Stars"" during classic movies and television shows.",1394150400,2,1568,4.7749077490774905

So why the four stars?  The remastering department has given us transfers that are somewhat soft in nature.  Edges are not as sharp as they could be.  Compare these transfers with those of the Perry Mason series, The Fugitive, and Burkes Law, anthologies from this same time period, and you can discern the differences
High definition and Blu-Ray have spoiled us.  The higher resolutions offered today serve to create a more demanding audience that is becoming evermore sensitive to picture quality.

Barbara Stanwyck, one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood, gives a superb performance in every episode. From a jailer's wife, snotty wife, victimized hostage, scientist, saloon owner, and etc, Barbara gives all of her best performances in these rare 14 performances. There is only one show, which doesn't feature her. It features Milton Berle. It is funny but doesn't compare to Stanwyck's performances. This is a dvd collection, which you will want to save and rewatch again. From watching this dvd collection, I want to buy more Barbara Stanwyck movies and her most famous show, The Big Valley. Also, I hope the researchers are successful in finding all the remaining lost episodes of the only season of the Barbara Stanwyck Show. So, as fans, we can watch Volume 2 of this collection. This is worth your money. Enjoy.
