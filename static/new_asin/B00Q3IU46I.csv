8690232,5,B00Q3IU46I,"mad respect after already having the skhayes couple (ninja night warriors) ad trainingin his shadows of iga camps and seminarsin warly  80s
then able to get the hard to get  dvds by hatsumii back then foundations of ninpo and togakure 2 vhs set and then robert  busseys set and rbwi set were very cool by the way since i had only got to to o to one of his camps he was trure to what he did

this set is the set of dvd that turned it all around for me as far as the bujinkan was concerned and helped make sense of the basic system. of bujinkan as skh system had these techniques but were not broke down in this manner

this is a great set even now! great start!
 his books are great to contain lots of kuden type stuff.
hope it helps you guys in the kan system as it was shaking out from late 80s into the new bujinkan budo taijutsu. it did me helped me aot but i see know there need to be a filler like this one for this gen to the next but those are available by others if sought .

 i learned ""togakure ryu ninjutsu"" then i didn't come back to the bujinkan stuff to the 90s and was lost in the whole budo taijutsu philosphy alot of people said it was the same but it was it was just taijutsu and some of it was watered down at that this helped. yea to all those its the same but there ARE things that just either aren't taught or aren't taught publically anymore which frankly i found fun.back when i was younger the camps were great fun. but again its till there good luck finding it or proving your worthy to learn it...",1433030400,2,1524,4.02317880794702

8690234,5,B00Q3IU46I,"I owned the four videos on VHS made by Black Belt that are included in this single dvd. Wasn't sure if it was a reproduction of those vids by Jack or something new.
I'm glad I have them on dvd now, but a mention of that in the description would have been helpful.
I enjoy Jack's taijutsu and the dvd is great.",1425340800,4,309,4.0
