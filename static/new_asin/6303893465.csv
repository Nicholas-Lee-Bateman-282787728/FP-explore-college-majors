Well presented, fast and interesting.
Lots of direct, as well as peripheral information.
Kids love it.  I love it.",1241308800,,163,4.821428571428571
8324344,3,6303893465,"Purchased video to use as supplement for History Of Medicine class (4th grade).  Was unhappy with the way things of a ""mystical"" nature were included in the material.  I don't  understand how the Producers could justify including information on Tarot Cards in the video.  After all, we were looking for information on Skeleton's, not an introduction into foretunetelling.  Also,I didn't care for the many references to man's ""evolutionary"" process from beast to man.  Again, wasn't looking for a intro. into the Theory of Evolution.
The material that did foucs on the Skeletal System was good, but cluttered with a great deal of unecessary tid bits that took away from the video itself. I ended up turning off the video about 5-7 mintues from the end.",1063324800,11,751,4.968
