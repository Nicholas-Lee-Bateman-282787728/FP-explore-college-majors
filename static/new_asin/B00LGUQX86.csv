6486376,5,B00LGUQX86,"I really enjoyed this movie for the simple fact is that it does have some truth to it back in the earlier days when dragracing was starting to gain popularity. There was a lot of people trying to manipulate the sport and dominated and control it. When I used drag race and came against a factory team. They found in a lot of ways to get me disqualified because they did not want a farm boy showing up a factory sponsored team, so this movie deftly has a lot of truth to it, and for that reason I enjoy it",1419897600,11,504,4.05

6486383,4,B00LGUQX86,How often do you see a classic Willys anywhere? A somewhat silly and predictable story line...but the cars and racing scenes make up for the story defects. A blown Willys is the stuff of legend and as an old hot rodder my dream car. Gregg Henry is suitably cool and Robert Culp is a suitable villain.,1517529600,,300,4.375

6486390,5,B00LGUQX86,"Great drag racing movie that catches the world of the early privateer excellently! The Willys in this film just makes your skin tingle with the though of how fun it would be to drop the hammer on. The best part is that it isn't a spit and polished movie car, the doors don't stay closed, gotta slam'em and recheck them just like a real willys. Street racing, crooked cops, money hungry promoters,almost more of a documentary of early drag racing. what more could you want!",1502841600,,472,4.564705882352941

8665761,5,B00LGUQX86,"I have been collecting "" Drag Racing"" & "" Car Movies"".  Yes ""Hot Rod"" is a made for T.V. movie but please don't let that dissuade you from being interested in adding it to your car movie collections because it is GREAT!!!  So is the 1983 made for T.V. movie ""Catch me if you Can""...which is very hard to find on D.V.D.!  Some times these made for T.V. films end up better that big budget blockbuster movies because they are forced to make up for a lack of budget with better storylines, more developed characters & good clean family fun!!!  The fact that so many made for T.V. movies have become cult classic's that are heavily sought after by collectors helps support my claim.  Made in 1979 "" Hot Rod"" A/K/A Rebel of the road, is placed in that last year of the 70's ushering in the 80's & does a good job reflecting the changing attitudes not only of those two decades but through the characters hints at the attitudes from the 50's & 60's as well using well placed lines from the characters & the soundtrack provided by a D.J. that is introduced as  a hitch hiker picked up by our "" Hero"" telling him "" I don't care where your going , I've been standing here since 1959!""  The whole history of drag racing is subtly given to the audience through dialogue through out the movie, its roots, its sub culture, and even its anti-hero rebel appeal.  Don't look for any Oscar winning acting or huge budget explosions ...just sit back reminisce and have fun.  Lots of Fun!!!  And if your a Muscle Car lover watch closely & you will see many fine cars!",1532217600,,1547,4.358885017421603
