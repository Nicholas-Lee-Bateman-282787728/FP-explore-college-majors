8503462,1,B006QZ889S,"BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!  This is another cheese, jerk off, bootlegging under reviews. The band in no way endorsed this, so you're giving your money to the thief who made this box. All it is: is the Smiths under review and the queen is dead under review.  No other footage.
I love the Smiths as much as anyone! However, do yourself a favor and just buy the smiths under review and the queen is dead under review.
You will save money, this cardboard box, not support a bootlegger, and maybe Mike and Andy will get some of the money.  I'm sure Morrissey and Marr are doing o.k. financially. Not to say that Mike and Andy aren't but they deserve more credit. I know Morrissey and Marr wrote the songs, but this is one of the most underrated and underappreciated rhythm sections ever.",1426896000,6,772,4.539568345323741
