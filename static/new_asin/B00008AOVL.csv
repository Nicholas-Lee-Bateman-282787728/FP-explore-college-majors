1832787,4,B00008AOVL,"I just returned home from a sneak preview of this film at my university.  It is truly a lot of fun.  It provides one hell of an adrenaline rush.  The star of the film, Jason Stratham, is sure to appear in more films to come after whooping some serious ass in this European fight fest.  Watch out Vin Diesel; this dude is one tough ...  Shu Chi, Taiwanese hottie and porn star, make this sweet eye candy on all levels.  The cars are hot, the fights are sick, and the music (Stanley Clark) keeps you one the edge of your seat from the very first scene.  If you like Luc Besson (he's the screenwriter) stuff, I highly recommend you check this one out.",1034035200,,648,4.219512195121951
1832788,2,B00008AOVL,"I happened to catch this one on a VCD...(Yeah, for real). Since Jackie Chan and Crouching Tiger broke barriers between the Hollywood and Hongkong industry. movie-makers have been capitalizing on the East-meets-West action market. Jason Statham is a promising new action star. But this Luc Besson/Corey Yuen movie is formulaic and weak. It has the classic French espionage theme that Besson is famous for crossed with mindless action scenes from Hongkong director Corey Yuen. Apparently, Jason Statham learned to bulk up and star in his own movie after a confusion as to who the REAL STAR was in Snatch, where Brad Pitt hail victory of course (Well DUH!). I thought the Chinese girl (Shu Qi) was annoying and had zero chemistry with Statham. I liked Statham in Long Stock And A Smoking Barrel, and Snatch especially. But if you don't see this one, you ain't missin much. I would just wait for the DVD to come out. But watch it if you enjoyed movies like Rush Hour, Kiss Of The Dragon, or The Professional.",1033862400,,1004,4.775862068965517

1832870,3,B00008AOVL,"The Transporter won't win any academy awards nor would I even classify it as a good film, above average seems more fitting. Regardless, it's an entertaining movie that really never takes itself too seriously even if at times the plot elements are a rather serious matter. I use the term plot pretty loosely as it's more so just an excuse for Jason Statham to drive and kick people in the face. In other words, typical for most action movies. Plots are only really there to necessitate the action.

Action itself can be a little hit or miss if I'm honest. There's two stand outs in the opening scene as a getaway driver that is well choreographed and has a few notable lines while establishing Statham's character. Other is the fight down by the docks that's just pure fun where he beats back an ungodly amount of goons. Ending sequence is a little meh and drawn out for my liking which is a little disappointing. Overall though it's good enough which really just sums up the movie as a whole. If your looking to kill an hour and a half and like action flicks, The Transporter is a good enough option.",1475625600,,1100,4.5

1832876,5,B00008AOVL,Unrealistic action of course like any action movie but those scenes are exciting none the less. I really enjoyed this movie and Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors. A lot of action but also quite funny. I can't wait to watch the sequels.,1474070400,,244,4.444444444444445

1832903,4,B00008AOVL,"This movie certainly brought Jason Statham to my attention.  As an actor he can frown, which isn't much.  But as an entertainer he brings a ferocious presence to the screen that better actors must envy.  He has a powerful athleticism that makes his set piece martial arts battles seem to be within the realm of reality.  He beats up loads of bad guys and does it with such sureness and vigor that we assume that the right guy could actually accomplish the task.
  Statham as a young man made a mark as a well regarded diver.  He has a divers physique, tall. slim-hipped and broad shouldered with long arms.  He surely has bulked up his muscles since his youth and the director has the shirt off him at every chance.
  His character, the Transporter himself, speaks little and acts much.  We discover that he had an active career in the Army but now works outside the law helping people to move things from here to there near Nice in France.  What things has no concern for him.  He needs to know how big, how heavy and where the package must be delivered.  And the very high transport cost, naturally.  This kind of close lipped hero, his unique code of business and his warm friendship with a French police detective make the film memorable.
  The film has fathered a string of films, three with Statham and now another with another actor as well as a TV show.  Without Statham the films are not tolerable.",1467504000,,1407,4.4940711462450595

1833135,5,B00008AOVL,"Well, Jason Statham is hands-down one of the most exciting martial artists to watch ever.  His monotone worldly attitude and bone-dry humor add to his default kick ass cool.  Hence, a perfect marriage for Statham and this story.  There are 3 Transporter movies, each equally exciting, well produced and written. But the standout in the  trilogy is No. 1 here--primarily because of the outrageously cool soundtrack music arranged and produced by Stanley Clarke (bassist and former member of Chick Corea's Return to Forever).  It's funky, quirky, lowdown and dirty--perfect for framing the Transporter's antics--and particularly his various nemeses.  The whole premise--ex-military freelance pro driver delivers any ""package"" no questions asked--is a great one, and there is even a TV series (seems like it's French) featuring Chris Vance (Prison Break) capably filling in the Transporter role. For an entertaining and kick ass movie time, watch this Transporter, and then watch the next one, and then the next one.  Hell, then binge watch the TV series!",1428364800,4,1052,5.378048780487805

1833296,4,B00008AOVL,"While it certainly won't win any awards for originality (nor did it), THE TRANSPORTER is probably the best solo vehicle for Jason Statham that I've seen up to this point (to include stuff that has come out more recently). It's an all-thrills, no frills action movie with minimal character development and a logically incoherent plot, but the action sequences and Jason Statham's charisma as a leading man more than make up for the flaws in the narrative. Certain elements date it a little bit (a few soundtrack cuts in particular), and it almost feels like a relic of the 90's except for the fact that this came out in 2002. Still, I have great nostalgia for these types of movies and I had a great time watching it. Not only that, but there was some humor peppered into the mix which makes it contrast favorably to other similar movies that take themselves a little too seriously.

Usually, somewhere along the line, someine else wants to either derail the deal or intercept the package.  This is where the various skills of the Transporter come into play.

Statham is an action man.  His characters are men of action.  This seems to come almost effortlessly to him.  It is a pleasure watching both of him work: actor and character.",1408320000,,576,4.633663366336633

The plot is great as is the cinematography but the acting by Jason Statham is somewhat mechanical while the acting of Matt Schulze is the best in the movie. There's so much action that there's not much time for the actors to explore the characters. The entire movie is basically a collage of short filmed action snippets, but it works. The cinematography is excellent for what at the time was a low budget movie. Luc Besson at Europacorp produced the movie and he is an expert and efficient movie making. On the official Transporter movie website ([...] there is a staggering amount of information on the production of this film. They list all the weapons used (by type and name) and there was over 100 weapons (props) used in the production! I love this movie!

And Jason Stratham does a really good representation of a the cavalry shortchanging himself because he can't get past his own sense of honor.  I'm not a dude so I don't really like this movie but impersonally, this movie is a three and a half star piece of entertainment.  It's well done and a very awkward point is ably made about how the Chinese see the West and how it doesn't matter if it is misrepresented as something dirty.

It's about kindness done to someone who herself is very kind but not in a position to save herself and it is about gratitude regardless of what does or doe not transpire between them.",1387670400,,729,4.377777777777778

As is the case in most of these types of movies, the plot's a bit thin, and you need to suspend reality a bit to buy into the spectacular escapes with bullets zinging and nary a hit.

There are some original fight scenes such as the oil slicked hero sliding and taking out a gang of bad guys and fighting a group of thugs in the enclosed space of a bus.  There's one scene where the hero, with arms bound, kicks a guy who approaches just over his shoulder - awesome.

For the ladies, watching Jason Statham fight shirtless in some scenes is a real treat.  Overall fun for action movie lovers, especially in the martial arts genre.",1380240000,,758,4.463768115942029

So, what was one of the coolest parts of the classic James Bond movies? Seeing what incredible car he'd wind up driving in a car chase around picturesque, winding European roads. Hey, that's a movie all by itself. Sure is. Add some incredible fight scenes, a few explosions, and a seemingly ordinary guy as the lead: ""Frank Martin"" could be me or youThat's his appeal. The everyman hero . . . Jason Statham sells it, and his ordinary English accent is part of his anti-Bond relatability. Dress impeccably (wing tips and driving gloves!), drive a nice car, and have mad fighting skills, that's all you really need to be 'secret agent' cool. That's all? Jason makes it look easy.

1833541,4,B00008AOVL,"""The Transporter"" is a fun popcorn action movie.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should we.  The plot concerns a fellow who is paid to transport things or people, no questions asked.  He's a skilled driver and adept at eluding trouble -- the latter in no small part because of his cardinal rules: don't deviate from the schedule and don't ask questions.  When the noises coming from the trunk of his car pique his curiosity during one job, he violates both rules and finds himself in the midst of a mess of trouble, resulting in amusing entertainment for us.

""The Transporter"" is very violent, in a cartoonish way.  There's nothing macabre or gross, but if you object to guns, car crashes, explosions, and martial arts-style fighting, this isn't for you.  If you enjoy movies like ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Die Hard"", the James Bond movies, and the Bourne movies, you may well enjoy ""The Transporter""",1366070400,2,912,4.84516129032258

1833644,3,B00008AOVL,"Jason Statham began his solo action hero career with a film made by two diverse kings of cool cinema: writer Luc Besson and director Corey Yuen, the latter making his return to American cinema over a decade after his contributions to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;series. With such a collection of talent to drive the production, a guy like me expected great things, but ended up sort of disappointed. It's hard to criticize the film since there's nothing really wrong with it and it has some really cool moments, but overall it seems to merely graze the target instead of nailing it.

The story: Frank Martin (Statham,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>) is a transporter - an expert auto driver and fighting machine who'll deliver anything in his car, even armed bank robbers making their getaway, if the price is right - who finds himself caught up in a deadly game of human trafficking when he finds out that his latest delivery is a kidnapped young woman (Qi Shu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gorgeous/dp/0767851161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gorgeous</a>) with knowledge of a massive moving operation of immigrant slaves...

Since his solo debut with this movie, Jason Statham has been the only performer in the last decade-and-a-half of Hollywood who's consistently thrown himself into the role of action hero. Forget Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel, and even Sylvester Stallone - none of them can match Statham's track record, and he has a considerable leg up on them thanks to his indulgence in martial arts. With that said, while he does pretty good drama-wise, his physical talents don't seem fully realized here. The fight scenes compose only about 50% of the film's total action content, but as the attraction I was most looking forward to, their lack of consistency weighs more heavily on this review than it might on others. While I liked the fight on the bus and got a kick out of the oily garage brawl, all of the encounters seem overly reliant on dreadful quick-cut editing, and at least the first one also indulges in debilitating close-ups. Statham's kicks are nice, but the nicest of them - a sort of flipping dropkick - was almost definitely performed by a double. The vehicle scenes are pretty good also, with the highway chase drawing parallels to the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, but they're not what I'm after.

The story and characterizations are stronger than you'd expect from a run-of-the-mill action flick, and what else would you expect with Luc Besson behind the pen? The relationship between Statham's character and Qi Shu's is nice, despite including mandatory out-of-nowhere sex, and I love how endlessly hammy and obviously evil the main villain played by Matt Schulze is. He'd pretty much play the same role two years later against Steven Seagal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Reach/dp/B000255LCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Reach</a>, but it's a bit more refined here and able to be taken seriously. With that said, the film definitely has a problem with its pacing - the finale really sort of sneaks up on you - and I can't help but reference that indecisive feeling of unfulfillment that comes with movies that Besson wrote/produced but didn't direct. The man got so much juice out of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leon/dp/B0006GVJEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B00008ZZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>, whereas in comparison something like this that has his handprint on it but not his auteurship sort of feels like a full-course meal that was interrupted midway through. Corey Yuen is my favorite action director of all, but drama- and development-wise he just can't hold a candle to what ol' Luc can do (co-director Lous Leterrier would do much better on his own three years later, when he directed Besson's Jet Li vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unleashed/dp/B000A2IPQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unleashed</a>).

In a surprising turn, the film's PG-13 rating doesn't work against it: blood and excessive language isn't missed. It's a decent action movie and probably more accessible to general viewers than any number of other offerings from both Statham and Yuen, but it's definitely not the best work of anybody involved.

1833648,4,B00008AOVL,"More fun than most in the genre, `The Transporter' understands how to create a lasting impression by combining both forms of intensity, physical and mental.  Of all the action stars vying for the next drop-kicking lead role, Jason Statham may be my favorite.  He just has that extra something that gives him an edge over the competition.  He knows how to break some bones, but he also possesses an `everyman' vibe to him that gives him a sense of realism.  The film has a more promising start than finish.  In fact, the brooding atmosphere and gentleness that pervades the opening half of the film is all the more sensational accompanied by the manic displays of perfectly executed violence.  The second half of the film free-falls a tad as the storyline and overall plot development becomes clich&eacute;d and formulaic, but Statham continues to use his skills to perfection and the chemistry he has with Asian beauty Qi Shu is enough to spark a flame (although I would have loved to see more of that love scene).  If you are looking for an action film with more brains than average, check this one out.  With some low-key and lived in performances and a backdrop that will make your mouth water (his home alone is beautifully captured), `The Transporter' is far better made than one may initially believe.",1318809600,,1307,4.777777777777778

The first time I saw Jason Statham was in The One. I certainly didn't think too much of him at the time because of his character's unstable British/Brooklyn hybrid accent and the lack of action he got in comparison to Jet Li and.. the other Jet Li, and I had no idea he'd transform into the kind of action star he turned out to be afterward. Then came The Transporter, a Eurasian concoction of film-making helmed by great French director Luc Besson and soon-to-be protgs Louis Leterrier and Pierre Morel and choreographed by long-time Hong Kong veteran Cory Yuen, who coincidentally worked with Li (in addition to at least half his other movies) and Statham (for the first time ever) in The One. Whoever came up with the idea to bring Yuen into these movies did a great job. Shallow and simple plot aside, The Transporter and its sequels have never been about the story, but about Frank Martin kicking butt and driving a fast car. The Transporter series is one of my favorite guilty pleasures of escapist entertainment because of the sheer style that accompanies the character of Frank Martin and his exotic adventures. He's calm, collected, where's a snazzy suit, performs some very elegant martial arts moves for a buff British guy, and looks cool doing it all at the same time. It's almost like James Bond and the whole ""deadly and debonair gentleman"" theme, but without all the espionage, gadgets, and actual attempt at developing a story. In fact, after watching this again just recently I have to say the action and driving sequences become more and more appreciable every time I see them. If not for the PG-13 rating, G.I. Joe-esque ""laser bullets,"" and occasional moments of cheese and campiness, I'd probably be so bold as to consider this ""quintessential"" for action junkies. However, I think part of the overall fun is its B-movie-ness and its ability to not be taken as seriously as other films in the genre.

Video - 3.5

Presented by Fox in 1080p at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using the now-outdated MPEG-2 codec The Transporter looks pretty decent, all things considered. Colors are vibrant with a reddish tint to skin tones, and film-grain has its fair share of screen time as well throughout a majority of the movie. Detail and textures are relatively fine, though close ups varied between ""somewhat crisp"" and ""really smudgy."" Perhaps more disc space or a more advanced video codec could've made for better sharpness and higher bit rates. Black levels and contrast are better than the SD-DVD, but again, being one of the initial BD releases before all the studios got the hang of encoding, much is left to be desired. Artifacts and debris are also present, though it's actually less than what I expected, especially in comparison to other transfers I've seen produced on more recent films.

Audio - 4.5

Although the video is just sub-par, the DTS-HD 5.1 track more than makes up for it. From the very beginning where Frank drives his BMW 735 around Paris we're immersed into the world of The Transporter with a very healthy dose of bass from Stanley Clarke's popping score and a mix of various car, crash, tumble, and clicking sound effects from the chase. Action sequences involving weaponry and fisticuffs do a good job sweeping between the high and low ends, with automatic weapons and crunching sounds being most prominent. Dialogue is clear and legible outside of all the thick accents from the actors and separation of music and sound effects is excellent. The only quality keeping me from calling this a reference track is the somewhat subdued LFE levels. They seem to be more accentuated by the music rather than the action itself, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it takes out just enough oomph to make this worth showcasing. Fortunately, though, the sequels fix that.

Extras - 1.0

Aside from trailers, there's only a commentary track featuring Statham and producer Steven Chasman. It would've been nice to see an interview by Luc Besson or maybe a vignette about the martial arts or driving choreography...

Overall - 3.5

The Transporter is full of testosterone and oozes cool all over the place. For me, it's also the beginning of what would become a pretty good action career for the actor formerly known as the character Bacon. He definitely has what it takes to be that sort of in-your-face, do-it-all action hero. And while the general opinion may be to call this a popcorn movie, I'd actually disagree and say pay more attention to the ""craft"" of the movie itself. The martial arts, stunt driving, music, and cinematography, while not part of a spectacular story, are actually very well-coordinated by some very talented people. With decent video quality and an excellent lossless track, action fans would do well to break Frank Martin's Rule #3 and take a look at this package.",1277164800,8,4845,4.8347406513872135
1833655,3,B00008AOVL,"Jason Statham's career has enjoyed a meteoric rise.  The Transporter (2002) was the first film to feature the rugged Brit in a lead role, and provided the opportunity for him to showcase his skills as a martial artist, and former professional driver.  Co-directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans), and with Cory Yuen focusing on the action scenes, the film is a slick and flashy affair, that's low on reality, and high on stylized action.  Co-written by noted French filmmaker Luc Besson (Le Femme Nikita, The Professional), the film is set in France, and features Statham as Frank Martin, a professional driver, who transports items from one destination to another, for a fee.  Martin lives by his own set of rules, but life gets complicated, when one of his packages turns out to be a beautiful Chinese girl named Lai Kwai (Qi Shu), and his customer named Wall Street (Matt Schultze), decides that the Transporter should be eliminated.

Although the film's premise is paper thin, things are played completely straight.  Setting reality aside, and going along for the ride, is not that hard to do.  The action is fast and furious, and Statham has an uber-masculine screen presence, that can be overpowering.

Frank and Lai end up together, after Martin makes a retaliatory strike at Wall Street's mansion, that leaves the place in shambles.  Wall Street is working with Lai's father, Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), in smuggling human cargo, and is determined to obliterate the Transporter.  Complicating matters, is coffee craving police Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand), who keeps poking his nose into Martin's affairs.

Corey Yuen includes several impressive Hong Kong style fight sequences, one in a bus garage, inside a bus, and another exquisitely executed ballet, battling in a pool of oil.  Somehow degreasing himself, Martin then parachutes onto a truck with the prisoners, taking it on a mad ride to the finish.  Throughout the film, the action is tempered by Martin's deliberate effort to avoid killing, unless absolutely necessary, resulting in a ton of leg wounds.  At the time, co-star Qi Shu was trying to learn to speak English.  She proved to be capable actress, and a quick learner, as she handles the dialog well enough, and has decent chemistry with Statham.

At this point, films like Death Race, the Crank films, and two Transporter sequels, have made Jason Statham, the foremost exponent of this kind of frenetic, over the edge, action thriller.  As he continues to expands his range, and hone his acting skills, the upside for Statham's film career, appears to be nowhere in sight.",1272067200,,2609,5.030232558139535

Jason Statham is very cool in the lead and it's he that makes this a fun film. I also enjoyed Shu Qi, a very pretty woman; the witty dialog of Francois Berleand and some stylish, tongue-in-cheek directing by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen. Another director whose films are known for their hip styles also co- wrote this: Luc Besson.

Some of the action scenes are outrageous. To Statham's credit, he did most of the action scenes himself. I guess he's a tough guy in real life, too. He's pretty amazing.

1833670,5,B00008AOVL,"We have become die hard fans of Jason Statham movies. The Transporter series being one of his best, we own all three. An English actor, Statham was born in Sydenham, on the south east London, growing up playing football and diving. His first experience with movies came from being cast by Guy Ritchie, British director in a 1998 hit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and later in the 2000 film Snatch.

In 2002 Statham was cast in the role of Frank Martin, a driver that transports cargo without asking questions and under strict rules: Stick to the deal, Don't ask names and Don't look in the package. Statham's martial arts background allows him to perform most of his own stunts and it is simply thrilling to observe him in action.

The first Transporter brings us a hard driving courier that soon enough brakes one of his own rules, looking to see what he is carrying to find a beautiful young woman that involves him in the inhuman trade of people to be used as slaves.

Frank Martin is good at what he does but when he gets involved and his passion is aroused he is a lethal weapon, unstoppable and effective. If you like action packed movies, this is the series to obtain. Don't miss it !",1238544000,,1197,4.481651376146789

1833673,4,B00008AOVL,"In The Transporter, British action star Jason Statham plays Frank Martin and gets more than he bargained for when he breaks one of his own rules. As a transporter, he gets paid lots of money to deliver packages between parties that aren't very nice. One rule is to never look in the package. Martin breaks this rule when he discovers he is transporting a live body. Martin delivers the girl, then on his way home the people who took the girl try to kill him. Frank doesn't like this, so he returns to the home where he delivered the girl and wipes them out. Frank wants to be done with the situation but the girl (beautiful Taiwan actress Qi Shu) wants him to help her find out what the bad guys are up to.

This is a quirky action film. The fight scenes are set to original music that turns the martial arts laden fights almost into comedic opera. Statham's Martin is an interesting character, but almost too subdued for a viewer to sympathize with. Action films can still be entertaining without strong character development or story. This is one of those movies. The plot exists to go from one fight scene to another.

The Transporter was obviously successful enough to spawn to sequels, and Jason Statham has gone on to star in many movies. Still, this movie isn't close to a Bond or Bourne film. This is a good movie to rent to see if you'll like its type of Hong-Kong martial arts-type action. Then, maybe, you can move onto the sequels.",1232323200,,1443,4.482889733840304

Jason Stratham as Frank Martin is excitement personified. One fight scene after another mixed with bullets, bombs and car chases. If one took the time though, their wasn't an unnecessarily high body count though. Didn't matter in this one. It added or took nothing away from this movie. The ""marose, cold , steele willed"" protagonist (Martin) gets too involved with a client and delivery package sparking all the action, and from that point on the action never stopped. The oil fight scene was the only bit of humor, and was funny enough.  The story was good, though it really wasn't preaching. So the story wasn't a big player. The romance was minimal, but appropriate. Could have been a little more of it, to explain more of Martin's concern for his love interest, whom he just met. The intrigue was also minimal. This will not go down as one of the greatest movies of our time, with a mystery unlike any other. Not necessary. This is all about a foot to the face and a hiyaaa! across the neck. Well Done. Very Well Done.  Stratham is an action star I plan on watching in many more such films.

1833679,3,B00008AOVL,"The Transporter tries to be a thrilling James Bond-like adventure, but ultimately turns out to be prime material for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Unrealistic, but more importantly poorly constructed, this gauche thriller only succeeds in being unintentionally hilarious - which oddly adds entertainment value the creators couldn't have planned for.

Frank (Jason Statham) only has three rules for transporting: 1. Never change the deal; 2. No names; 3. Never open the package. For the right price and proper dimensions he'll get the job done, no questions asked. And his ex-military skills ensure that his getaways are clean - and look good. Although he's not unaccustomed to breaking the law and aiding criminals, Frank has morals that betray the often iniquitous business of professional transportation.

So when Wall Street (Matt Schulze - going along with the no names policy, apparently, several of the characters are only given generic monikers in the credits) hires him to transport a package that turns out to be the bound and gagged young Asian woman Lai (Shu Qi), his mixed feelings get him involved in helping her uncover a smuggling operation run by gangsters who will stop at nothing to see him dead.

Frank is prepared for every single situation, which makes his careful pre-planning more than convenient. Scuba gear for a hasty underwater escape and the knowledge of truck routes for following enemy vehicles are the least of his uncanny abilities. Every scene is merely a setup to get from one stunt location to the next, and it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that Frank's constant unlikely reappearances are beyond good luck. During his journey from jail to office buildings to bus yards, he's accompanied by irksome music that makes each coincidence noticeably more intentional.

The action itself is frequently amusing, with excellent choreography and riveting stunts, especially when he kicks down doors to get to baddies, fends off axe attacks, and slickly maneuvers in massive oil fights. Frank likes to lose his shirt during every other scene, volley with Shu Qi's laughable dialogue, and deflect rockets with cookie trays (a scene in the trailer that never made it to the theatrical cut). Statham's not the typical action star, but he has a certain intrigue all of his own. What he lacks is the silly and catchy one-liners that usually plague these kinds of generic action films - for which there are countless moments that they could have been aptly applied.

In the tradition of cheesy action flicks, The Transporter's car chases, martial arts and stunts are quite enjoyable; plus there's a delightfully witty show-stealing performance by police inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand) - if only that annoying storyline didn't keep popping up. But maybe that's expected from director Corey Yuen, recognized for his martial arts choreography on X-Men and Lethal Weapon 4.

Transporter is a high action movies involving an ex-Special forces soldier who earns his living transporting ""packages"" for various clients, mostly shady.  In this movie, the transporter ( Jason Stratham )violates his own rules ( he's real big on rules ) and looks inside the package, doesn't like what he sees and doesn't complete the delivery.  Bad idea, now the client is after him, along with the police.  The movie is set in the French countryside so if you don't enjoy the thrill-a-minute action, just enjoy the view.

Highly recommended for fans of Jason Stratham  , James Bond movies, and high action movies, especially car chases.

1833688,3,B00008AOVL,"Ay Caramba! Where to start with this fast paced ""Ronin"" meets stock Jet Li movie. I'd say it was a movie about cars, but that's really only true for the first 1/3rd of it. I'd say it was also about cool kung fu, but that's only for the middle 1/3rd of it. And I'd say it was about waaaaay over the top fight sequences and physics defying stunts, but that was the last 1/3rd of it. So I guess I'll start with the first 1/3rd of the movie and work my way through it in sequence, so that we all know how well this movie started, and why it developed 4 flat wheels, blew its head gasket, and subsequently ran off of a cliff. By the way, ""SPOILERS AHEAD!"". Consider yourself warned!

Jason Stratham is a ""transporter"", that is a professional wheelman, or for those of you not in the know, a getaway car driver. Clients, typically those with criminal tendencies who need someone with a good set of wheels and the skills to use them, contact Stratham's character, Frank Martin, and contract him to serve as their getaway driver. And the man plies his trade with unbelievable skill, without so much as a dent or scratch. Frank lives a life of seclusion along the beaches of France after retiring from the military. At least that's his cover to local police investigator Tarconi (played well by really likable Francois Berleand) who is ever suspicious of our main character.

Frank is very careful in his job. He lives by 3 rules; 1 - Never change the deal, 2 - No names mentioned, and 3 - Never open the package. When Frank takes a light job transporting such a package in his trunk, he breaks one of his own rules and looks inside the package to discover a Chinese girl inside. Still trying to maintain his business ""ethics"" Frank pretends he didn't see anything and delivers the package to the intended client, a smarmy playboy/crime lord type played by Matthew Schulze...who I'm pretty sure was hitting on our hero there for a moment. I think. At any rate Schulze's character knows that Frank's looked inside the package, and attempts to kill him via the use of an exploding suitcase he's asked Frank to transport to another client.

Now, up until this point in the movie everything was working hunkey-dory, which is when the director decided to pour about 2 lbs. of sugar into the gas tank. Stratham, having narrowly avoided being killed, goes on a kung-fu rampage against the goons at Schulze's house, and once finished there steals his Mercedes, one that has a certain Chinese woman hiding in the back seat. This is where the movie starts to ask you to suspend your disbelief. It will be asking this a lot of you in the remaining hour of the film, and in ever-increasing levels.

From here we know that the Chinese woman, played by rather cute Shu Qi, is named ""Lai"" and was being used as some kind of bartering chip, or as a hostage, or something. The movie is never really clear on why she was being transported, although I guess it might be because she's nosy and put her cute nose somewhere it didn't belong. At any rate Frank cuts Lai loose in his seaside villa and the two ponder their next move. The next morning, Frank's house is attacked by a bunch of goons armed with enough ordinance to make 3 sequels.

After the predictable escape and a totally out of left field sex scene, the plot tells us that this whole mess is about 400 Chinese people trapped in some shipping containers that are about to enter port. Lai wants Frank to help her rescue those people from Schulze and her father, some sort of demented Chinese business man/crime lord with no sideburns. The plot kind of goes in several different directions at this point, and at no time follows anything remotely resembling the word ""linear"", although ""predictable"" somehow becomes the mantra of the entire film. There's more kung-fu in this movie than you can shake a chopstick at, and enough over the top antics to keep you paying attention long after the plot has ceased to matter. And it will cease to matter, trust me. And the stuff that just totally disregards physics...it's mind boggling. Here's an impromptu list of absurdities that would keep Einstein busy with formulas long after he'd conquered the Theory of Relativity.

- How exactly did Lai manage to open the door on the car while taped into an office chair, let alone climb into the thing?
- Bullets ricocheting off of oil soaked concrete don't make sparks, but will blow up an oil can floating in the ocean
- One can throw a tire iron, while off balance and clinging to the underside of a truck moving at 60+ mph, with only one hand and successfully smack a driver in a car 10 feet away through an open window. And right in his temple. Ow.
- 200 Chinese people will easily fit in a truck trailer, with lots of room to spare. Also they don't go to the bathroom or eat for a week at a time. When Lai opened the back doors it should have smelled like a poop factory in overdrive. Instead one slightly disheveled child meanders out and the trailer isn't even half packed.
- The piece de la resistance. The infamous parachute scene. Are we supposed to believe that after an impromptu drop (never mind that he dropped from the plane in front of the convoy and then magically appears behind it, in mid-air) from 500 feet that his expensive steerable parachute (which all crop dusters are equipped with) travels at least 70mph? I'm not even going to touch the probability of his actually even being able to *land* on top of the truck, let alone getting into physical contact with it. I don't think there are Navy SEALS alive that could duplicate this one.

Other things I learned from this film:

- All hired goons are masters of the martial arts, in one form or another.
- Said goons are pretty courteous, always taking the time to attack people one at a time, even when outnumbering them 10 to 1.
- Chinese women on the lam can cook local cuisine on their first try and not only make it edible, but make one overly sentimental about it. I wanna see Lai try doing pit-cooked pork shoulder barbecue in one try. Then I'll be a believer.
- European truck cabs are big enough to be apartments
- European buses have lots of foot long metal bars laying around on the floor. If you ever find yourself in one and wonder why watch this movie and you'll understand.
- A stethoscope and a submachine gun are standard ship container searching equipment
- French gendarmes apparently drive in subcompact police cars. This may be fact, but if the local police here start using Honda Civics I *will* be moving.

So after all this, why give the movie 3 stars? Well, to a certain degree there were some things the movie got right. The first 1/3rd of the movie is fantastic. I really, really enjoyed it and wish that the director could have kept it going. The soundtrack is surprisingly good. The music used fits the different scenarios nicely and adds just the right amount of feeling for the scenes.

This is a movie that caters to a particular kind of viewer. If you enjoyed ""Ronin"" or ""Heat"" this is *not* going to be your cup of tea. If you loved either of the ""Matrix"" sequels (unlike the original, which was pretty solid), ""The Fast and the Furious"", or ""xXx"" this is gonna be a wonderful experience for you, one you'll want to hastily add to your collection of style over substance collection. And you know who you are. :)",1201737600,,7338,4.510526315789473
1833689,4,B00008AOVL,"'Some Rules Should Never Be Broken' could have easily been a tagline used in the advertising for this movie. Sometimes when we break the rules the consequences really hit us hard, which is the case for the main character Frank Martin, in the Cory Yuen (acclaimed Japanese action film director) directed surprise smash hit ""The Transporter"" starring Jason Statham.

""The Transporter"" focuses on ex-special forces soldier Frank Martin (Jason Statham) who makes a living transporting various items for high-paying clients who value timeliness, reliability, and above all else, secrecy. He is a man whose life is dictated by a strict set of rules that he abides by; however, on his most recent job Frank makes a costly mistake. He breaks what could be called his 'Cardinal rule', the one that dictates the transporter is to never open the package he is delivering. But once the rule is broken there's no going back. Now, Frank finds himself on the run with the very package he was assigned to deliver, a young Asian girl who has been trailing an international slave trading ring, and he must summon all of his training if both himself and his package are to survive the pursuit.

I'll be honest, when this movie was first advertised to arrive in theaters, I really didn't give much thought to seeing it. There didn't seem to be all that much appeal to my tastes in the movie. To me, I thought it was just another mindless action flick with little to no story, having one action scene after another being held together by flimsy dialogue that wouldn't have even been acceptable by B-movie standards. So, needless to say I merely forgot about the movie for quite some time, until I happened to catch a glimpse of the trailer for the sequel. What caught my eye with this preview was the fact that if this kind of movie was getting a sequel, then maybe there was more to the original film than I had given it credit for. So, shortly before the release of the sequel, I decided to break down and rent ""The Transporter"" figuring if nothing else, it will distract me for at least 90 minutes, and who knows maybe I'll even be entertained on some level. After all, someone must have thought the original was pretty good if it warranted a theatrically released sequel rather than one that is straight-to-DVD as most sequels of this variety would have been.

The story for ""The Transporter"" isn't deep by any means, lets not kid ourselves about that. Even though it's not all that original, and contains a basic plot that has been used countless times before, the dialogue was surprisingly well-written, and the fights were flat-out impressive during some of the action sequences, that you easily overlook the simplicity of the story. Of course, when watching a movie such as this, you really aren't looking for something all that complicated, so there are times when simplicity is the better way to go, and this movie is definitely one of those times.

But this movie would have been nothing if not for the charismatic screen presence of the movie's lead, Jason Statham (""The Italian Job""). Statham brought such an easy going attitude to the character of Frank Martin, when coupled with his intense charisma and screen presence, he took what was a run-of-the-mill action flick and elevated it into a hugely entertaining and memorable action movie that thrills audiences from start to finish. The supporting actors were mostly solid in their performances, all the characters were heavily cliched, but some of the actors appeared to take it upon themselves to add depth to their characters, allowing for a much more enjoyable experience. It's no doubt in my mind that they were the primary reasons that this movie wound up becoming a big hit in theaters, raising this film above the mediocrity it was most likely destined for.

Regardless of how good the actors or the story for any action movie may be, the movie will be nothing if it doesn't feature impressive action sequences that blow the audiences socks off. Which is exactly what many of the numerous action scenes do in ""The Transporter"", and what's more impressive is that Jason Statham performed a majority of all his stunts. With his intense screen presence that can't be ignored, and his impressive athletic ability as showcased in the numerous fight/stunt sequences it's easy to see why Statham is quickly becoming Hollywood's newest action hero.

If you are a fan of martial arts movies, action films from the likes of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme, then ""The Transporter"" is a movie that will be of great interest to you. And in my opinion, will entertain you ten times more than any of Seagal or Van Damme's efforts from recent years, plus the acting and storytelling are better than most entries are in this genre.

""The Transporter"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.",1189296000,,4849,4.813925570228092
1833690,4,B00008AOVL,"I'd never heard of this film or it's principles, and watched this based on the Amazon plot-summary and multi-star rating. I was engrossed thruout the flick, and rank it as almost as good as Jet Li, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Chuck Norris action classics. The ""almost"" is because the martial-arts sequences seemed somehow slightly sluggish, tho often commendably novel.

The characters and plot (including some great car/van chases) were better than most of these classics, the dialog more real, and the French scenery a great plus. The bad guys were great scumbags, and got the upper hand often enough to keep the good/bad tension steadily absorbing. The intrepid female lead was an appealing and believable gamin for our stone-faced Hero to save repeatedly, and the (predictable) outcome of the drama was straightforward and satisfying.

Kudos to all who brought us this addition to the Thriller / Action / Martial Arts genre - More more!",1182470400,5,940,5.058064516129032
1833691,4,B00008AOVL,"The Transporter is Jason Statham's first big solo role in a movie, and it is a success with the followups of Transporter 2, Crank, and the anticipated upcoming film ""War"", where he fights one on one against Jet Li.  Jason has participated in several films before Transporter in somewhat lesser roles such as ""The One"" and ""The Italian Job"", but the Transporter finally lets this man shine - and he brings a character to the screen - Frank Martin - who is intelligent, skillful, strong and one downright cool guy.

The movie has a good and promising beginning, showing off the cool factor of Frank Martin immediately.  Followed quickly by an intense car chase scene, the movie never lets up after that - whether it be action or suspense.  The story is not too interesting, but it is put together well.  Frank discovers that a package he is transporting is carrying a live body inside.  Frank's ""tough-guy attitude"" is worn down and he breaks his own rule by opening the package.  The receiver of the package is no dummy, and realizes that Frank broke the rules and has his car destroyed.  Frank, fortunately absent from his car during the explosion, seeks revenge but ends up with company along the way by accident - the girl inside the package.  From here the story begins to take off as Frank becomes entangled in the situation all the more.

While there isn't a tremendouns amount of action, the spacing of action works well enough.  The final 20 minutes are huge, easily containing the best scenes in the movie.  I especially liked the fights in the bus garage and the final highway truck scene which reminded me very much of the truck scene from ""Raider of the Lost Ark"".

Transporter is a great movie for Jason Statham.  I really enjoy this guy, and see a good future for him.  His martial art skills are truly entertaining, as is his stunts and acting.  This is an hour and half of just great relax entertainment.",1182211200,,1919,4.616519174041298

He usually doesn't look at his deliveries but he ends up getting involved with the vietnamies girl and eventually finds out that her father is loading up his people and bringing them into the country for cheap labor.

Below ""B"" grade acting, pathetic story line, and a sound track cut straight from an early 80s porn movie.

The stunts and action was so choreographed that every punch or kick was filmed separately and then put together to try and form some sort of fight scene. It was more a comedy than an action movie as I was laughing at how bad it was. I don't know how this made any money at the box office.

I couldn't believe I sat through the whole movie I will never get that 88 minutes back.

Wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. There needs to be a rating below 1 Star.",1151366400,,831,4.142857142857143
1833701,4,B00008AOVL,"I'm not a huge fan of action movies, and I really didn't have high hopes for this one, but The Transporter turned out to be a pretty enjoyable flick.  The story, the action, and the characters are all held together by the cinematic equivalent of Crazy Glue, but somehow that doesn't really matter all that much.  This movie is really all about the action, which comes at you almost non-stop.  It pushes the envelope of realism to the breaking point a few times, but it's unusual and therefore interesting.  Jason Statham is basically a one-man wrecking crew, and he has a style all his own (which lies somewhere in between traditional martial arts and basic street thug tactics).  It's quick and intense and, most of all, purely entertaining.  I've never seen a fight such as that waged on an oil-covered surface by Frank and an assembly of goons.  It's just one example of a slight comic touch that seems to define much of the action and special effects - you will witness several ""oh, come on!"" moments in this film.

We don't learn a whole lot about Frank Martin (Jason Statham).  We know he is ex-military and that he currently earns his living transporting dubious goods.  He's a meticulous perfectionist who lives by a few simple rules - or at least he did, until his current job came along.  It should have been simple - pick the bag up here, drive it to there, deliver it, and go home 40 Gs richer.  A flat tire changes all that, as he can't help but notice the bag resting atop his spare tire in the trunk is moving.  Enter Lai (Qi Shu), undoubtedly the most attractive piece of cargo he's ever transported.  Now you might expect Frank to let the girl go - but Frank always honors his deals.  That would have been the end of the story if his client hadn't double-crossed him in the end.  They really shouldn't have made Frank angry.

As luck would have it, though, Lai seems to have established some sort of bond with Frank.  Coming to the aid of a damsel in distress isn't really part of his nature, but Lai shows no compunction to flee from this man who was himself less than kind to her.  She tells him a story of Chinese citizens being shipped via packing crate for lives of slavery, and he eventually gets involved in the whole mess - but only after those same guys come calling in a most direct fashion.  There's a weird dichotomy between Frank and the local police investigator that moves the plot along to its conclusion, which is actually a good thing since the slave trade story tends to meander a bit on its own.

Frankly, I don't find Jason Statham charismatic at all, although he's certainly efficient at what he does.  Qi Shu, on the other hand, breathes the only signs of life into a film that would pretty much stagnate without her.  This really is quite an unusual film.  It makes clear from the very start that you can't take it seriously, and the basic story is a rather muddled affair, yet it succeeds largely in terms of its action alone.  That isn't how things are supposed to work - yet I can't deny that I found The Transporter quite entertaining.",1151107200,,3080,4.476702508960574

Jason Stratham plays Frank Martin, a transporter for hire specializing in safely getting items from point A to point B.... for a hefy price of course.  His life is pretty good until he violates one of his most important rules and then gets caught up in a scheme with enough action to keep you on the edge of your seats for most of the movie.

If you enjoy movies with great acting and a sound-proof plot, then this is not your movie.  Jason Stratham does okay.  The most entertaining person in the film, in my opinion, is Francois Berleand who plays a French detective (and he does an even better job in the second movie).

1833721,5,B00008AOVL,"Jason Statham is the jolt in the arm that Western action films needed.  His appeal to me recalls a latter day Steve McQueen.  Aside from being up to physical demands of the role in a sly understated way Statham gets into the skin of Frank Martin, disillusioned ex-Special Forces officer turned amoral transporter for unsavory parties.  The film is a great hodge-podge of American, European, and Hong Kong action styles.  Director Cory Yuen manages to comfortably weave edge-of-your-seat car chases, gunplay, and hand-to-hand combat into the film's narrative.  The film's basic plot of Frank having a change of heart after uncovering a white slavery operation has resonance and doesn't come off as a cheap ploy to engender sympathy for Frank.  Definitely an action film whose reputation will grow in time.  Bring on ""Transporter 3"".  I'm listening.",1137196800,4,847,5.176470588235294
1833722,4,B00008AOVL,I must admit that I agree with some of the other reviewers in saying that Jason Statham bassically is the film. Of course the story isn't really all that impressive but the idea of a transporter that is a ex special forces man and he just can't stay away from trouble is genious. To sum it all up this movie is really all about amazing car chases and fantastic fight scenes and they chose the perfect man to execute both. Even though some of these scenes look a bit unrealistic the rest of them are perfect. The only problem i have with the film is the camera work. You can hardley see some of the fights because of bad angles but other than that the movie is an action packed work of art.,1137024000,7,689,4.18796992481203

It was lame, and the fight scenes were so unrealistic and over the top that they weren't even fun. On top of that, the fights weren't well made. And it's the action that should make or break a movie like this. And here, it clearly breaks it.

Mediocre at best, don't ""transport"" this DVD home.

And what a shame, co-written by the wonderful Luc Besson. This had me thinking: this guy's slipping. That's too bad.

The acting is fair but more mediocre than good and the love story thrown in a la James Bond is random, pointless and stupid. I hate it when they do that for action movies. But love story or not, this movie isn't worth or rental or a sequel.",1136160000,,890,4.285714285714286

The Transporter gets checked out with a new transfer for this re-release. The 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen RSDL transfer is quite good, with strong colors and sharp detail. Contrast looks good and blacks come across nicely. Some minor print defects can be glimpsed, but they're very rare.

  SOUND:

The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix from the original DVD is carried over to this disc. It is good solid track, with lots of dynamic range and dialogue is audible throughout. However, some might prefer the DTS track,which contains a lot more bass and is a bit more juiced. The dialogue is a little more difficult to hear during action scenes, but it is still audible. The rear-channel activity is impressive on both, with lots of sound separation and directionality. There also are French and Spanish Dolby Stero 2.0 mixes available.

1833739,3,B00008AOVL,"As you might expect, a film about a hard-hitting kung fu driver for organized crime goes much heavier on the chopsocky than on characterization or plot.

It just doesn't make sense that she's getting carted around in the Transporter's trunk.  Of course, the actual reason is ""it's in the script,"" and she is simply the MacGuffin.

Ultimately, Statham's likeability and kung fu skill, and the fact that this film keeps moving, are its saving graces.  If you are in the mood for some action, and you're willing to just roll with the movie rather than think about it too much, this is at least worth a rent.

Some of the acting by the supporting actors is rather bad on the other hand though, Jason Strathan has a very natural and commanding presence on screen and makes an interesting choice for an action hero.

There is very little difference between the two editions, so if you already own this movie you might want avoid this one unless you are a completist.

New to this edition is an ""Inside Look"" that features the trailer for and a brief behind-the-scenes featurette on The Transporter 2 (2005) which promises more of the same only cranked up a few more notches.

There is an audio commentary by actor Jason Statham and producer Steven Chasman. The two men offer anecdotal recollections of making this movie with the occasional gaps.

Another new extra is ""Behind the Scenes...The Transporter,"" a 35 minute featurette that explores various aspects and mixes on the set footage with clips from the movie. It shows how some of the exciting car chases were orchestrated, rehearsal footage of Statham's fight scene in the bus (with some funny bits as he tries to get a knife trick right) and how certain special effects (i.e. explosions) were done. This is a good look at how this film came together.

Also included is the previous version's making of featurette that was more of a promo puff piece.

There is a ""Storyboard-to-Film Comparison"" for some scenes from the movie that allows you watch the storyboards and the film separately or view them both simultaneously.

""Extended Fight Sequences"" features the first edit of three fight scenes with optional commentary by Statham, Chasman and director Yuen. Statham is candid in voicing his disappointment at the cuts that were made because they disrupted the rhythm of the sequences. Yuen talks about how he wanted the action to service the story and not the other way around.

Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, a former military man who's turned into a transporter, with his own set of rules. On a seemingly simple job, he breaks one of his own rules (rule 3: never look in the package) and his entire world blows up in his face. Suddenly, Frank is sucked into a dark world of human slavery and organized crime.

The fight scenes are amazing to watch, they held me spellbound, and the chase scenes are simply fun. Other reviewers are pointing out the plot holes. There's a few, but frankly, who cares? This isn't Alfred Hitchcock, nor is it trying to be smart, high drama. It's more analogous to Quentin Tarantino. It's just action for the fun of it.

If you're looking for a movie that will enrich your life and make you think- go rent Schindler's List. If you're looking for a movie that will entertain you, thrill you, and make 90 minutes race by- then get yourself a copy of the Transporter.

Highly recommended for all action movie buffs.",1124582400,,1102,4.445544554455446
1833760,3,B00008AOVL,"This action movie is a ""short attention span"" movie watcher's dream come true.  But can a movie have too much action?  The Transporter might just fall into this category.  Just about every scene in this movie contains a car wreck, fight, or explosion.  After a while, you almost get bored with the constant action.  Some of the fight scenes are totally unbelievable, guys are just standing around waiting to get kicked in the pie-hole.  If this were a video game, I would be complaining about how bad the enemy A.I. was.  One scene where ""The Transporter"" tries to commandeer a truck, is almost a identical rip-off of the truck scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", only not even half as good (or humorous).  After all is said and done, I do have to give the director and writers credit for making a consistent action movie, there is no fall off here, from the start of the movie till the end, kick-butt action!

Bottom Line:

If you can overlook the rip-offs and stupid fight scenes the movie is definitely worth a look. Now stand still so I can kick you in the head!!!",1123891200,,1068,4.487046632124352

The scenery in this movie is beautiful (until it gets blown up) and the action is nearly non-stop.  I certainly wasn't bored.  Jason Statham does a fantastic job with his character.  No, he doesn't have a huge amount of dialog, but his character doesn't require it, nor does he.

A person with a very interesting review(one starrer) said some pretty interesting things about how the cops managed not to catch him.

I might want to add my bit to that. I don't know why/how they never shoot the guy's head off when they get a chance to. Instead they sent 10-15 men to beat him up who eventually somehow get beaten up. Oooh he's probably like one of those video game characters that just keep hitting the bad guys and dodges bullets somehow,someway.

All in all watch this movie if only you're bored to the extent that you know you might fall asleep. Hopefully the sleep will come only after the first half hour of the movie. Until then you can try and stay awake. Pardon my sarcasm but this has a very poor ending,much of which I thankfully didn't follow.

This film does not deliver either of those things, but what it is does deliver, it delivers in spades.  The opening of this film is absolutely terrific and it maintains a wonderful action torque throughout its first half.  While the second half drags a bit, due to the fact that it's hard to keep an action film burning on pure adrenaline alone, I was very pleased with the overall results.  The camera work is really well done in this film and the action sequences could not have been better.  Jason Statham is very comfortable in this role and I hope to see much more from him in the future.

As stated, the opening of the film is killer and the premise is quite intriguing, formulaic though it is.  We are presented with our tough guy--a man whose criminal life is directed by a system of uncompromising rules, making him very likeable and principled.

Jason Statham, plays Frank - a transporter who will transport anything without asking any unnecessary questions and following few simple rules - one of which is never to look into packages he is transporting.

His problems begin when he decides to take a look, because in the package he was transporting there was obviously something alive and moving.  The package is a chinese girl Lai (played by delightful Shu Qi), whose father is involved in smugling Chinese slaves.  She wants to stop his father and in a process involves the transporter, who happens to be very well trained in combat.  Here the chase and the non-stop action begin with one good guy fighting against a whole organized gang of bad guys.

Other than the chases and fight scenes, and in spite of the unbelievable scenes, I liked the Frank's character - his head is screwed on right - he is focused on what he is doing, he is well-organized, he plans whatever can be planned and when things don't work out, he just moves on - there is no waste of time or energy on bemoaning one's destiny or planning vengance for damages suffered.

And then the wheels start to come off. The setup is perfect and the early scenes with the girl are well done. The action sequence in which the hero turns out to be a kick-ass fighting machine feel right because it's all driven by the story.

And then he gets her back to the house and all the logic drains from the film. The action follows the familiar action sequence (how BAD the bad guy is; the big chase; the bigger set-piece fight; the final showdown; the heart warming ending: I miss anything?)

If you keep that in mind and don't try to nit-pick it, you'll enjoy it much more.  It's meant to be fast, furious and outrageous.  It's the perfect antidote to boredom.

Jason Statham is a rising star.  I've seen his limited role in Snatch, but he gets to take his career to a whole new level as The Transporter.  He's refreshing to watch with his cool, collected British manner.  This movie would have been a complete flop without him.  After countless Van-Damme and Segal flops in the last decade, Statham is the new action hero to cheer for (don't get me started on Vin Diesel).

The film is beautifully filmed on the south coast of France (a nice change from the streets of L.A.).  A primitive musical score tries to keep the action alive.  And, Wow!  What action!  Stratham demonstrates his kick-boxing talents and makes mush out of anyone who crosses him.  But it's the suave, Bond-esque manner in which his character conducts his ""business"" that makes this a really cool flick.

The movie has logical flaws and exaggerations.  I mean, lots of them.  But I reserve my critical judgment for more serious films.  Thankfully,  Luc Besson has left this one open-ended and ripe for a sequel.  Maybe the bugs will be worked out of the next one before it gets to production.

1833800,5,B00008AOVL,"This 2002 film is action all the way.  So much action, in fact, that the story doesn't matter.  It plays like a young man's fantasy - fast cars, things that blow up, and a pretty girl to decorate the scene.  The English actor, Jason Statham, is cast as the cooler than cool hero.  He lives is opulent splendor on the French Riviera and is supposedly a former soldier with the British Special Forces. He now makes a living by transporting packages and/or people in his luxury BMW car.  For example, the beginning of the film shows him pulling up at exactly the right moment at a bank heist.  Four bank robbers in masks rush to get picked up.  ""The agreement called for three,"" he says.  There is no time to argue as the police are closing in and so they shoot one of their members and throw him out of the car.  Of course there is a car chase, with dozens of police cars falling off cliffs or banging into each other as the transporter's car leaps over barriers and is totally immune to all the bullets being shot at him.  And that's just the first five minutes.

The transporter's next job consists of delivering a small suitcase to a location.  All goes well until he gets a flat tire, opens the trunk and sees the suitcase moving.  When he opens it, he finds the lovely Qi Shi, a pretty young Chinese actress who manages her role well, in spite of the fact that she speaks very little English.  No problem though because there is very little dialog anyway.  Mostly, things blow up, including our hero's luxury house and the pair are forced into a daring underwater escape.  There is more and more action and more and more people getting killed and some sort of redeeming value in the plot about saving Chinese slaves from a cargo container.  The most important thing in this kind of film, however, are special effects and  the martial arts of the hero who can knock out a dozen armed men with a few well-placed kicks.

This is a film targeted to teenage boys.  So what is it that kept the eyes of a mature lady like me so glued to the screen?  Perhaps its because the action was so intense and outrageous that it just locked in my attention in a way that wound up to be totally relaxing.

Unfortunately it's pretty much the same stuff and by choosing this one over the aforementioned you are not really going to be seeing that much better.
The packaging of this movie has one or two things you should know about. First of all this is a LUC BESSON produced movie. Yeah, that's right, it is a Luc Besson presents ""The Transporter"" but is not labelled as such because most ""Luc Besson presents"" movies are really bad in plot, structure, story and dialogue in favor of big explosions and car chases. In essence, The Transporter is the exact same sort of hokum, except for Jason Statham showing us that he can do some stunts and in fairness he does them well.
If you did not like ""Taxi"" then you will not like this one. If you liked Taxi then you can expect pretty much the same thing - terrible plot that is just there as a convenience to show some car chases, punch-ups and shoot outs. It was good to see Statham doing the action hero thing although he does lack a bit of charisma and the hard man side does not come through as well as it should because of various scenes that give him a heart.
The plot is really full of obvious holes with totally unbelievable scenes (especially with the detective) and has something to do with a mafia dealing in slaves and Statham being double-crossed on one of his transporting jobs. Cue various set pieces involving Statham doing some stunts, beating up the bad guys and saving the day. In terms of storytelling it is a way below average for its type, but the action is not bad and at least the fun fight sequences and odd laugh help save this one from being as bad as the one star screenplay.
Only watch this one if all the good rentals are out. Older teenagers or young adults will probably like it and although there is a lot of violence it is not generally bloody and is played out more as a display of martial arts and stunt work than for graphic shocks making it somewhat family entertainment on par with the latest Bond flick.",1075939200,2,2109,4.410256410256411

1833806,3,B00008AOVL,"While watching 'The Transporter', I was reminded of the days of Jean-Cladue Van Damme & Steven Segal movies. The late 80's & early 90's was a time in movies when one man could take on a whole crime syndicate by himself and win. I mean look at the similarities in place here: One white guy takes on an asian bad guy with a cool, tough talking henchman. He gets the asian girl and he uses kicks and punches more than he uses guns. I mean it's like I was watching a Van Damme movie made in the year 2002.
That's not to say this is a bad movie. Just don't go into this expecting great acting or a drama filled plot. Jason Statham plays a Transporter. Basically he will transport anything to any location for a fee & no questions asked. He has certain rules that have to be abided by. He ends up breaking one of his own rules by opening a package that he was paid to transport by a rather bad man (Matt Schulze). He finds a young asian girl (Shu Qi) inside the bag. To make a long story short, the bad guy tries to blow up the transporter. He gets pissed. Goes back to bad guy's house and preceeds to kick everyone's ass. And so the movie starts.
Like I said, this will not win awards for writing or acting. It's a fun action movie. That simple. Jason Statham makes it better than it should be by being a decent actor. This is a Van Damme movie with a WAY better lead actor. He shows that he can be a lead in an action film and make it work. I would love to see more of him in this genre. The rest of the cast is rather average. Statham definately owns this movie. And that's the way it should be in a action beat-up movie.
I would check this out if you like mindless action flicks. This tries it's hard to be a Hong Kong martial arts action movie. It doesn't get to that point, but it's definately worth owning if you can find it for cheap.
The DVD itself is pretty good. I can't complain about the picture or the sound. The extras aren't great, but they are passable. There is a commentary track, some deleted scenes, a making of featurette, and a trailer.",1072915200,3,2053,4.135
1833807,1,B00008AOVL,"I have been a bit concerned recently about the lack of RRDMs (Really Really Dumb Movies). I love RRDMs - some of them offer so much fun it is a crime to miss. Well, I finally hit a jackpot with ""Transporter.""
There are movies where plot is built upon a single stupid idea. ""Transporter"" is not that kind of a movie - each stupid plot idea is followed by the next one that makes this one look like a gem of a human culture. I am confident they used one of the big soap opera scenario writers to write a scenario for this one. Too bad they weren't allowed to put one of the characters in a coma...
You know, criminals are apparently really bad when it comes to driving. Most of them tried many times but failed to pass for a driver license. That's the basic premise of the movie. What, you are not rushing to buy or rent it yet?! Read on. Now, since the crooks cannot drive, they need a driver for hire to drive/transport them. The kind of driver that can transport a briefcase or a bag from one French town to another without asking questions. The one that is able to drive the bank robbers for some half an hour in a small town completely surrounded and followed by police cars and not get caught and/or identified (note to myself: move my bank accounts from small French coastal towns back to US on Monday).
So everything goes fine: the crooks get same day delivery without giving in to FedEx, the cops are happy because even though they suspect the protagonist to be the transporter, they cannot prove it (not a single scratch on his car - his driving instructor must be a happy man). It all goes downhill however, when he manages to look into a package during one delivery.
I will not delve further into the plot as I don't want to spoil your fun. The premise discussed here is nothing compared to the rest of the film. I especially liked the girl's father (Ric Young). He looked so unnatural (in Michael Jackson kind of sense) that I was sure that he would reveal himself as a woman at the end of the movie. All in all, the actors fit the plot perfectly: there is no Cannes or Oscar kind of performance here. Oh, and you actually get 2-in-1: a movie AND an endless BMW commercial, which makes ""standard"" product placement employed in other films nowadays pale in comparison.
To conclude: run, don't walk, to rent this movie: you will have so much fun it will hurt.",1070755200,13,2368,4.347629796839729

1833809,4,B00008AOVL,"If the world were a different kind of place, Jason Statham would be a huge star. But as it is, despite strong showings in this film and in ""The Italian Job,"" he's not.
Actually, Statham has all the right stuff: he's athletic, intelligent,sexy, honest (to a point)and physically imposing for a short guy. You know the kind of guy you'd share a bottle of Tequila with, let your sister go out with, have beside you when you go to beat up your brother-in-law or drive your Mom to the mall. He's a guy's guy and a woman's guy. He harkens back to the Gables, Stewarts, Fonda's of the world. He's the strong/silent type with extras. I'd really like to see him as a romantic lead, maybe in a film with Drew Barrymore or Jude Law.
This film is nothing new plot wise but it's done with style and grace and the scene of Statham and a bunch of bad guys and a drum full of motor oil is a classic.
If there is any justice in this world, Statham will be the next James Bond. But being that there isn't much, let's hope he has a long, brilliant career instead.",1068768000,35,1044,4.225
1833810,4,B00008AOVL,"Like an exotic sports car, ""The Transporter"" is a triumph of style, with some great things going on under the hood, but not a few rough edges.
The film has a very non-American look and feel to it, which is alternately part of its charm and a bit off-putting. Jason Statham is a winning action hero, strong, sexy and cool, and doing his own stunts in a fashion more bruising and bone-jarring than even a young Jackie Chan ever achieved.
The story moves along at a rapid clip, and if the logic is sometimes entirely absent -- especially the lack of a response to some of the violence and explosions in the streets and in sleepy French hamlets -- the action set pieces are so good, it's hard to argue.
Statham's combat scenes in particular are nothing short of amazing. While they sometimes stray into the overly stylized fighting style in this post-""Matrix"" film industry, the danger and outright pain of the fight sequences is convincing and thrilling.
""The Transporter"" feels like the first Statham-starring film BEFORE his inevitable breakthrough film. Catch him here and be first in line for whatever that huge action hit will turn out to be.
Highly recommended for action movie fans looking for the next great action star.",1068595200,,1225,4.755868544600939
1833811,3,B00008AOVL,"This film starts off absolutely excellently, with great pace and dialog, violence, a wicked car used immediately in a fantastic chase, good music, and a great on-location foreign setting; it's basically a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BMW-Film/dp/B000GV1VRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BMW Film</a>.  Then you get a little plot, some complications, and some more really good fighting and shooting action.  The opening was excellent, and I was looking forward to a great film.  But as the film went on, the holes in the plot and the continuity just got bigger and bigger, the lead actress' ability to act got weaker and weaker, and the story got more and more stupid, until by the end it was just absolute crap.  I was thrilled watching the opening, but by the end I was glad I'd not paid to see it.

I'm a Statham fan, of his work with Guy Ritchie, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-One/dp/B00005V1WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The One</a>, and cursing John Carpenter for killing him off in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghosts-of-Mars/dp/B00003CY6P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghosts of Mars</a>.  Statham is buff in the role, if a bit flat, due to his character. He's methodical, thorough, and completely professional, and it clearly applies to all aspects of his life.  Yet in all he goes through--he goes through a lot--he barely shows a trace of anger, or surprise, or anything else.

Qi Shu is awful as the female lead, hollow and awkward, not knowing what to do with her arms.  She's at her best when bound and gagged early in the film.  The only time she comes off convincingly is when she's speaking Chinese.  She is grotesquely thin, and just not that attractive, as stock Asian film beauties go.

I can see why this film didn't do well in the US.  It's just too Euro, with the unfamiliar French scenery, the Mediterranean architecture, the metric measurements, the too-thick French accents.  Even the Chinese actors are mushy when they utter their English.  But luckily, when it counts everyone speaks English. And the bad guy's English is excellent.

Much like other action films, physics takes a holiday, with bullets penetrating 8-inch thick stone walls.  A bad guy takes an entry-and-exit shot to the head, and all it leaves is a smallish glob of brain-goop on the back window of Statham's perfectly maintained BMW.  Compare this to Vincent capping Leon in the face in ""Pulp Fiction.""

The obligatory love scene is comical, in that there's nothing in the preceding 30 minutes to create any chemistry or tension between Statham and Qi Shu.  And there's no romantic follow-up of any kind, no hand-holding, no knowing/loving looks, nothing.  Awful.

The plot and continuity just get worse and worse as the film goes on.  Statham jailbreaks with a hostage--cut to Statham in some beater Saab, with no police chase.  He hops in a launch called ""Cassis"" at the quay, which in the next scene has been transformed into the ""Mannon.""  My 7-year-old daughter noticed this continuity flaw; why didn't the filmmaking professionals catch it?

Later, in a port the size of Marseilles, how is Statham going to find a single container full of undocumented Chinese?  With a stethoscope, naturally.  This place handles probably 10,000 containers/day, stacked in blocks 10 across, 20 deep, and 10-12 high, yet apparently he plans to listen to each one.  The flaws just accelerate.  The bad guys ignite some sort of fuel/oil in the choppy waters of the harbor with weapons fire, but the same shots fired onto an oil-covered floor do nothing, not even sparks.

Granted, the fights are choreographed very well, in that Statham gets to take his shirt off a lot, and his moves are the coolest, strongest, most acrobatic, etc.  The bad guys, who at one point outnumber him something like 9 to 1, come at him singly, each politely waiting their turn to get punched senseless.  He beats and belts, but doesn't kill any of the bad guys who after all are all out to kill him (what about the two hapless cops in the trunk of his blown-up BMW?).  Statham goes down only once, right when the plot needs him to, with a single kick delivered by a little guy whom Statham punched the living hell out of earlier in the film.  Weak.

The final chase is an action-packed joke.  Statham parachutes from a crop duster (where did that sport chute come from?) onto a truck moving at probably 60 mph.  The bad guy appears on the opposite side of the truck from where his vehicle was less than 20 seconds earlier.  Throughout the chase, there are two containers full of Chinese immigrants in the convoy, but Statham saves only one.  Where did the other one go, with its assumed slavery-bound immigrants inside?  And when they open the container up, it's not absolutely packed with people, but is only about 1/3 full, and there's no dead bodies in there, no piles of trash, no filth, no wretched urchins half-dead from 20 days locked inside a tossing metal box.  Instead, a delightful and cuddly little Chinese child wanders out of the darkness for a loving hug from the wooden Qi Shu.  Barf.

At times, the highly original Stanley Clarke-of whom I am a huge fan-soundtrack just wasn't matched to the film, its pace, mood, or scenes.  There were a couple of times when really pounding hip-hop rap was playing, loud, over a fight scene or chase taking place in the south of France.  That's just too forced, trying too hard, a sad ploy to be too cool, to appeal to one demographic too many.  The soundtrack also was just too intrusive at times, taking over the action itself.  This reflects poor post-production.

In conclusion, go ahead and watch, don't ask too many questions, and try to avoid paying for the experience.  You'll get a fantastic opening, some good stunts and cool fighting, but characters and a story that unravel faster than the speed limit on the southern French autoroute.",1068163200,8,5997,5.057026476578411

Jason Statham had been great in Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Unfortunately I was saddly disappointed by The Transporter. It was long, boring, and had lots of mindless and pointless action scenes.
And I think I know what the problem is.
The DVD includes 20 minutes of unseen action footage that has been added back in. I made a friend watch this DVD who had seen it in the theaters and he to was amazed at how bad it was, he didn't remember it being this bad.

1833813,2,B00008AOVL,"There are intellegent action movies, those with interesting plotting, those with chemistry between the leads: The Transporter is not one of those films. The Transporter is action qua action.
The plot (what there is of one) is simple Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a transporter. He is the personthat can get any package anywhere no questions asked. Sort of the Fed Ex version of James Bond. Martin lives by three simple rules: 1) Don't change the deal, 2) Don't ask for names and 3) Don't look in the package. On a routine transport Frank breaks one of his rules and finds beautiful Lai (Qi Shu) in a bag. Lai's father and a mobster named Wall Street are importing slaves in cargo containers into Marseilles. This must be stopped. It is here that all semblence of reality goes out the window and the movie reverts to mindless action.
There is not much holding the film together and at times looks like one big extended car chase/ fight scene.  Sort of a BMW commercial with violence. The film is the English language debut feature of martial arts director Corey Yuen. Yuen was helped by French action director Luc Besson. Their collaboration leads to a beautiful looking film that really is a bit of a mess.
Statham may be an up and coming actor in the Jean Claude van Damme mode but he is not there yet. Shu is quite beautiful but she has not mastered enough of English to be more than eye candy and the PG-13 rating does not help to create the sexual chemistry necessary for the pair to work.
This Fox DVD has additional star and producer commentary, a making of featurette, and extended fight scenes with or without commentary. The added fight scenes , to be honest, didn't look a whole lot different from what appeared in the finished cut of the film. A problem with the special features is that some are located on each side of the disc. I hate flipping discs to get to other featres.
On the whole the Transporter doesn't offer much more than mindless action . Check your brain at the door and watch it for what it is. If you absolutely need to add it to your collection look for it as a previed DVD or in the bargain bin.",1065744000,8,2128,4.4704370179948585

The premise is actually interesting.  The whole rules thing is interesting as well.  I can't say it was a bad story as so much as it was kind of boring.  The story kind made you want to see the next fight scene, which kept coming.
On the fighting, the movie scores an A+.  The fighting makes the movie worth seeing.  I'd say the fight scenes are just a notch below The Matrix in excitement but in my book The Matrix is the gold standard of fight scenes.  Which means that they're pretty damn good.
The ending is pretty anti-climactic and ho-hum.  It's a good movie but not one I'd watch over and over again (my standard for judging movies).",1063324800,,805,4.2368421052631575

Gotta love that.

The story is not deep or even very hard to predict.  What is great are a handful of fine performances, some fantastic fight scenes, great snappy dialogue and a pace that keeps you interested till the end.

He obviously had not seen the old silver case ploy in 'Ronin'. But he shouldn't have to. ""This film is fun"" one of the film makers tells us in the special features. Yes, I love seeing two policemen murdered by the indirect actions of the dirtbag hero while carrying out their lawful duties. And the police chief just let's him off the hook?

1833827,4,B00008AOVL,"I finally got around to seeing this movie and man am I bummed I didn't see it on the big screen. Jason Stratham (""The Italian Job"" and ""Snatch"") is one of the most exciting talents around and this film shows him off perfectly!
Not only were the pyrotechnics great (heat-seeking missles destroying a castle-like chateau on the French shore), the hand-to-hand was brilliantly choreographed and executed. There wasn't a wire in (or out) of sight! Like Jackie Chan, Stratham uses everything within his environment as a way to win even though he's always out-numbered by the bad guys. Barrels of used oil? Great! He spills it, rolls around in it, now they can't grab him (he'd lost his shirt by then) without slipping right off! But unlike the wonderful Jackie Chan, when Strathum hits, it's pure streetfighter - you know it hurts and hurts hard. He uses brilliant tactics - not just brawn - to turn every dire moment to his advantage and ends up coming across like a real man's man, a genius at survival and winning.
The opening scene amps up the tension as Stratham, a retired Army special ops officer, picks up 4 guys who have just robbed a bank of millions in bearer bonds. His contract, however, was for transporting only 3 people, and the car's shocks wouldn't handle the additional weight. He calmly tells the robbers that they've broken one of his three rules and refuses to drive. I won't spoil the rest, but suffice to say it turns into a wonderful car chase through the streets of France.
His second job doesn't go so well. The ""package"" is a girl who is being hushed up so she cannot inform the police about slave trading. Stratham ends up complicating his simple life for a cause, somewhat aided by the French policeman who knows what he really does but refuses to give him a lot of grief for it when there's no real proof because he respects ex-military men.
Stratham's unique blend of physicality, great voice, charm and testosterone has no equal. He deserves to be a huge star. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 4 instead of a 5 is that the climactic ending failed to live up to the quality of the beginning by just a tad. It's also not one I would watch over and over, but it's definitely worth seeing once or twice.

1833828,3,B00008AOVL,"Jason Statham has the look and charisma to be the next Vin Diesel, if only he was given a better chance. Take a look at his latest movie, ""The Transporter."" He owns this movie. He takes control and lets the audience know this picture is his. In every action scene, we don't doubt his worthiness to be up there with the action greats. Now all he needs is a plot. And that's the film's biggest problem. The plot, which seems a little contrived at times, takes up a little too much time where there could be a tad more action. Thankfully, unlike many other films, the movie ends at just the right time and doesn't opt for a fake cop-out where you think the villain is dead but then he returns. Statham plays Frank, an ex-soldier who now works as a transporter for people most likely wanting illegal services. He's very good at what he does, but one day, he delivers a bad package and now his life is on the line. Filled with exotic locations and very cool stunt pieces, ""The Transporter"" provides a very satisfying rush.

I have never seen him in another movie, but I think he is physically appealing and has what it takes to be the white guy version of Jackie Chan and Jet Li.  The DVD version is nice to own/watch because of the extra features.  And it confirmed my suspicion about this move.  That someone said ""hey let's make a martial arts-kinda-movie with lots of explosions and fights scenes.""  Then everybody got up and started blowing stuff up.  And ofcourse someone forgot to write a decent script.  The positive side of this movie is the exposure of Statham and Shu Qi to American moviegoers. They are both gorgeous looking people. Statham is all muscles, compact and fast but can actually act when  required. Shu Qi holds her own in this movie.  You can tell she couldn't really speak English because she carefully enunciated her lines, but that's a minor distraction.

That's what I felt after watching this hugely enjoyable action romp from director Corey Yueng who has collaborated with such as Luc Besson in the past in movies like ""Red Dragon"". This movie has a distinct European feel, not only in locations, but also direction, and one could be forgiven for thinking this was a Besson movie. This notwithstanding, it is a great roller coaster action flick, with some very well choreographed fight and action sequences. Mr Statham plays retired special forces hardman Frank Martin (why do they always retire so young?) living in the South of France who is a highly paid, feared and reveared professional courier, sporting a customized BMW, and formidable array of weapons (himself included). Regardless of the cargo, he conducts himself with consumate expertise, and deadly force where necessary, but is essentially a morally driven ""good guy"" who just happens to work as a mercenary. Quickly embroiled in a kidnapping, and attempted murder he stirs up a veritable hornets nest of villians who are not only armed to the teeth, but also ruthlessly led by a sadistic and equally die hard nemesis played by Matt Schulze. You can easily watch this movie over and over again for it's non stop action pace, and very slick direction, but the more discerning viewer, will want to leave the intellect behind, as this is pure adrenaline junky material. I would have given this movie 5 stars, but for a couple of reasons. Some of the fight sequences just cross the line a tad on believabilty (even in this genre of escapism) and the amazing ability of all character (Statham included) to endure taking the kind of punishment that would drop a Rhino, and still bouncing back like new. The only other moan would be the annoying habit it seems today, of multiple scenes and sequences that appear in the trailer, NOT being in the film! - if you check out the extended features on the DVD you'll see.

Jason Statham who is in theatres now in ""The Italian Job"" was on the British Olympic team in Seoul in 1988 and puts his athleticism to good use in the many action sequences in the film.  Particularly intricate, the DVD shows how the fight scene in the cab of the truck was staged, making maximum use of movement in a confined space.  Similarly, the sequence on the bus is excellent and the comparison cuts on the DVD of interest.  I also appreciated that it was cold in the sequences with the oil, which was actually syrup, and that you could actually see Statham's breath in the extended fight sequences.  Matt Schulze who lost about 40 pounds from his appearance in ""The Fast & the Furious"" so he could literally fit into the truck cab fight sequence does a nice job as the villain ""Wall Street.""  Robert Mark Kamen also wrote screenplays for ""A Walk in the Clouds"" with Keeanu Reeves, ""The 5th Element,"" and all parts of ""The Karate Kid.""  I like how he handled the romance with Lai, Chinese actress Shu Qi.  It seemed like the chemistry clicked.  Ric Young who I've watched numerous times in ""The Corruptor"" has also appeared in ""7 Years in Tibet"" and ""Nixon.""  He does a great job of being unlikable as Lai's crime-boss father Mr. Kwai.  I particularly appreciated the cameo appearance of French actor Francois Berleand as Tarconi the police detective.  What great soulfulness in his eyes as he takes a fairly minor character and gives it a great fullness and believability.  Jazz great Stanley Clarke's music score was also excellent.  Some of the plot does stretch believability in a James Bond sort of way such as parachuting to the top of a moving truck; however, if we believe Bond can parachute into a moving plane, perhaps this is great cinematic magic too.  All in all, this is a great rainy day DVD, one I've enjoyed repeatedly.",1054684800,,1961,4.627167630057803
1833836,4,B00008AOVL,"Jason Statham is the next big action star in Hollywood.  It seems it goes in streaks where there are definitive stars for periods of time, but lately it seems we've been introduced to many of them (i.e. Vin Diesel and now Statham).  The Transporter is the movie that will give Statham his much needed exposure.
For the movie itself, it was a step above the average action flick.  The action sequences were incredible, and something we don't see in every action movie.  There were a few scenes that I said ""that's impossible"", but who cares.  I'm not watching to see real life.
The first 30 minutes were wonderful, with the opening car chase being the kicker.  It was one of the better ones I've seen in a long time.  Everything just unfolded very well, but the movie eventually slowed down to develop some plot, and it sort of brought the movie down.
The directing was smooth and had good editing.  The music was a breath of fresh air.  It just seemed refreshing and new, and it definitely added to the movie positively.
The Transporter is a good film if you're looking for terrific action, not for a movie high on plot.  4 Stars",1054598400,2,1129,4.517241379310345

I'm gonna grab 2 machine guns and blast  everyone ending, which I like.  But only 3 people die, and no machine guns are used in the climax.  Is that the kind of ending people expect from a movie throughout the first 70 minutes with guns blazing and rocket launchers blowing up?  A simple answer, no.  What ever happend to the movies who had a huge punch in the ending, like Scarface, The Matrix, Exit Wounds, The Terminator, 1 and 2, and alot of other movies.  Lemme guess, maybe it's cuz this movie was PG-13, instead of R.  Well if that's the case, whoever said PG-13 action movies are dumb are absolutly correct.

I agree with the other reviewers that the action was definitely exciting, though at times it borders on the outrageous -- at least I can fathom Neo taking on 30+ opponents and winning (the concept of the Matrix allows for it), but even a military-trained operative in the ""real"" world would be sore pressed with the odds that Frank (Jason Statham) faces in this movie.  Similarly, there were stretches of the imagination abound -- surviving rocket launches and machine gun fire unscathed -- but the tempo of the action sequences made up for poor acting.
Ric Young, who had a great cameo in the first season of Alias, was working from a poor script (""I paid thousands of dollars... for you to learn English, the least you can do is speak it!"").  I find it hard to believe in the character with such lines.
The total twist in plot around the middle of the movie is rather disconcerting.  I liked the first forty-five minutes when the character of Frank made sense.  I agree again with other reviews -- developing a conscience mid-movie doesn't fit the character development.

Unfortunatley this recycled and at some times slow effort (even at the short running time of 90 minutes) just seems to never get going.
Despite the cool cars, cool lead actor and actress, The Transporter doesn't seem to transport us anywhere.
The villan is goofy and not even that scary.
I was impressed with the fight scenes and the kung-fu style fighting.  Which seemed a little weired considering the guy is supposed to be from France.
If you've seen classic movies like The French Connection, or even more recent one's like The Bourne Identity, then you will be dissapointed by this effort.
The DVD is also not exciting at all.
Very minimal extras.  They don't even give you the standard ""Cast & Crew"" section that tells you about the stars in front and behind the camera.
Over all, not a terrible effort, but nothing great either.  Same goes for the DVD.",1053907200,,947,4.625
1833843,4,B00008AOVL,"I really enjoyed Jason Statham's performance in John Carpenter's `Ghosts on Mars.'  I was therefore very excited to see that he's taken a real step up in `The Transporter,"" where he plays an operator hired to ferry illicit material via car from one specified point to another.  As such, the premise is weak.  (Why would you need to hire someone to do this?)  But the film, which is overflowing with both action and incredulity, is entertaining nonetheless.
Jason falls for a cute Oriental Babe, Shu Qi, whom he discovers in the trunk of his car stuffed into the zippered satchel that he's delivering.  She has gorgeous eyes and shapely legs.  Her beauty, unfortunately, doesn't improve appreciably once the duct tape binding her mouth is removed.
Her Confucian father, however, is an even pricier piece of work.  He has wild eyes and plastic looking skin.  But even more distracting is the spidery toupee he wears that looks, on most occasions, as though he applied it to his scalp backwards!
The movie's action sequences and cinematography, thankfully, are first rate.  Jason spends a lot of time driving a pristine black BMW around the lovely streets of Monaco.  He dodges armor piercing rounds and wire guided missiles which completely destroy his house.  He does a reasonable imitation of both Jet Li and Jackie Chan as he brawls (seriously and comically) with numerous bad guys throughout the film.  And he finishes with an exciting Vin Diesel XXX-like drop-from-the-sky-by-parachute-rendezvous to hijack a Mercedes eighteen-wheeler led convoy to save the day - and win the girl - while simultaneously rescuing us from her father's hideous appearance once and for all!
If you watch this feature, don't bother counting the flaws in the plot.  You'll quickly run out of fingers.  Even so, `The Transporter' is still mindlessly entertaining.  I just hope that this movie indicates that better films are yet in store for us...from Jason Statham!",1053820800,2,1946,5.056426332288401
1833844,1,B00008AOVL,"Don't get me wrong. I love a god action film. ... But this film, Transporter, is for the kids. Large caliber automatic weapons and handguns produce as much recoil as cap pistols, bullets somehow produce lighted streaks when sailing through the air and walls, and guided missiles are so slow to arrive on target that folks can see them coming and have time for a spot of dialogue before leaping to safety.
The film makers are only boys playing guns in this movie. Forget the ""realism"" with regard to firearms. The story itself is so clichd I could barely believe it was being rehashed one more time. It was yet another ""cold professional/assassin slowly reveals a heart through his forced protection of hostage/victim"" storyline. As is often happens, the filmmakers and actors involved haven't got the skill to pull this trick off, and things are quick, sloppy and unconvincing.
The holes in this film are so huge as to make the whole thing comic. My favorite part is when a phalanx of bad guys assails the hero's chteau in France with everything from AK-47s to heat seeking missiles for a full one to two minutes, spewing rivers of spent cases the whole time, without either stirring the interest of any neighbors or police.  The tough guys don't seem tough. The bad guys don't seem bad. Finally, the musical score and dialogue belong in a bush-league soft-core flick.",1053388800,,1368,4.772151898734177

Since then he has acquired a blackbelt and alot of rippled muscles to make his first starring role in ""The Transporter"". Statham plays Frank Martin, a former british special forces agent who now works as a transporter for just about anything. His code of conduct is, never change the terms of the deal, never learn each others names, and NEVER look in the package. His latest assignment involves tranporting a duffel bag across europe, and he winds up violating the golden rule and finds Lai (Mega-babe Shu Qi, in her first american film), a somewhat talkative Chinese girl. She reveals that her father is a slave trader, and wants her as part of the family business. With this information, Frank reforms and agrees to help Lai bust up her father's operation. This is as good an action movie as it could've been, in fact better. It's got chases, explosions, gratuitous PG-13 level nudes, kung fu fighting, you name it, because this movie is likely to please just about anyone in need of escapist thrills. It's not every martial arts movie that has a fight in a bus station, with the floor drenched in motor oil, and the hero strapping bike pedals to his feet to execute the kicks without falling on his butt.",1053388800,4,1300,4.607758620689655

Also just like Vin Diesel in xXx and/or The Fast and The Furious he is very smooth with cars and women.

1833847,4,B00008AOVL,"If the second half of this movie had been able to duplicate the action and fun of the first 45 minutes of this movie, it would be one of the greatest action films ever made.
But, well, they didn't.
The movie starts out going full speed (literally) while introducing you to Jason Statham's character--a detail-obsessed courier who delivers packages for bad guys. His reputation is built on his 3 guiding principles: Do not renegotiate/change the deal; no names; and don't look in the package. Of course, he winds up breaking his own rules which puts him and the human ""package"" in mortal danger.
Fighting his own instincts, he gets involved with trying to help the woman. The movie gets sort of predictable from this point on, with the standard love scene/kidnapping/show down with the main enemy.
What saves this movie is Jason Statham, and the lack of cheesy one-liners. Jason's moves are extremely good, and there are some scenes when he looks almost Jackie Chan-like (almost).
Overall, it's much better than average, but not without its flaws. One last thing--the techno sound pulsing through the movie is not the U.S. soundtrack for the movie. If you want the music from the movie, you have to go to www. Amazon.com's UK site.",1053302400,,1230,4.834123222748815
1833848,4,B00008AOVL,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy an action flick last night, but when my hubby popped in Transporter I found my attention held almost against my will.  I don't generally choose action for my own movie nights.  Unexpectedly, the combination of incredible but well-pulled-off stunt sequences and the undeniable charisma of Jason Statham hooked me in.
In case you (like most law-abiding citizens) didn't know, a transporter is the guy who not only acts as a high-priced delivery service for such savory folk as mobsters, but also occasionally lands gigs driving the getaway car from the scene of the crime.  From the opening scene where he is doing just that, our transporter, Frank Martin, is clearly the best in the business.  A series of improbable car stunts and narrow escapes during the getaway chase establishes the general fast pacing of this movie and the slick professionalism of our ""hero"".  And guys, his Beemer almost has enough gadgets to qualify as a 007 model.
This transporter made the fatal error of breaking one of his own rules when a mobster hired him to deliver a package:  Never Look Inside.  Sure enough, he discovered a conscience within himself.  From that point on, his fate was set against the powerful underground smuggling cartel dealing in human cargo.
The chase scenes, fight scenes, and general action that ensues throughout the film are interspersed with just enough plot twist to keep it interesting and just enough humanity to keep it grounded without becoming maudlin.  This is a somewhat toned-down version of a James Bond-like fantasy, set in the beautiful rural countryside of France and riddled with bullets and explosions that take out cars and buildings instead of entire islands.  Of course, there is the obligatory gorgeous female who can't keep her hands off of Martin.  Great for the testosterone and the estrogen all at once.
In the end, the Transporter did its job:  I had fun without rolling my eyes once.

1833849,3,B00008AOVL,"Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen's 2002 film ""The Transporter"" can be best described as watching a live-action video game: the film offers lots of action within the framework of a very weak plot.  The film's main character, Frank Martin (Jason Statham), earns his living as a mercenary, who stealthily transports items (including people) across Europe in his black BMW, which he meticulously maintains in immaculate condition.  He prefers to work on a nameless, ""no questions asked"", basis with his clientele, but demands exacting descriptions of the cargo with regard to dimensions and weight. He is paid quite handsomely for his services so that he can live in a rustic house overlooking the Mediterranean Sea along the southern coast of France. A local policeman, Tarconi (Franois Berland), keeps a close eye on Frank by making unexpected visits to his seaside home.  When Frank is hired to transport his latest package, he notices that it moves when it is dropped into the trunk of his BMW.  Along his leisurely drive to transport the 'item', he stops for food and makes the mistake of offering water to the person inside his trunk, an annoying woman named Lai (Qi Shu).  Having violated his own rules, Frank gets himself into trouble with her consignee, Darren 'Wall Street' Bettencourt (Matt Schulze), who attempts to kill Frank.  Frank returns to seek his revenge upon Bettencourt, but unwittingly rescues Lai and continues to dig himself deeper into trouble.
The biggest flaw in the film is the development of Frank Martin's character.  Initially, he is presented as being a very cold, uncaring and calculating perfectionist who is prepared for virtually any situation.  When he feels sympathy for the person that he's transporting in his trunk and becomes embroiled with her problems, it comes across as being totally unapt.  Another major flaw is the film's editing, which is highly reminiscent of playing a video game: i.e., people suddenly appearing out of nowhere and Frank's very elaborate defenses conveniently matching every circumstance.  The film does have a few memorable scenes including the demonstrations of Jason Statham's martial arts skills, the bank robbers, and Frank's home being attacked.
The acting is average to below-average (especially Qi Shu and Ric Young, who plays her father Mr. Kwai) and the weak plot is predictable.  However, the constant mlange of flying bullets, rocket-propelled grenades, explosions and car chases make for a mildly entertaining film that I rate with 3 out of 5 stars.  If you are looking for a lot of action, but don't care about plot, ""The Transporter"" can give you just that.  If you haven't seen the film, I advise renting it first to determine if this is a film that you want to watch more than once.",1053043200,3,2763,5.046153846153846

When he gets a flat, he sees that the package is moving.  He instantly knows what it is, it is a person.  He breaks his own rule and looks into the package and sees a pretty young woman.

All that aside, if anyone is looking to claim the aforementioned mantle of being a big screen action hero, be it Jason Statham.

He is disciplined, organized, patient, precise, and always on time.  Until his curiousity gets the better of him and he stumbles upon a plot organized by international slave traitors.  Hong Kong action vet Cory Yuen makes The Transporter his English language directorial debut, and Statham is a more than fitting actor for the role and this is a showcase of his goods as the next big screen action hero.

I could only imagine some of the horrible things that happened, I didn't have to see it. That's actually makes more of an impact on the mind. GREAT IDEA! It's like a scary movie, if you don't know where the killer is or if you haven't seen the monster that's lurking it's much scarier.

The amazing action sequences is worth the money alone. I loved the bullet flares, or flashing, they added, it almost looked like Star Wars or some kind of Sci-Fi. Pretty cool touch.
Thinking back, I don't even remember any cursing. If I'm right about that, then that's a shocker. Movies like FORMULA 51, Back to the Future trilogy and PREDATOR 2(and hundreds more) are ruined  by all the foul language. It is refreshing to watch a movie made in the year 2002 with this consideration. Some may argue, all the reasons I liked this movie take away from the reality of it.

She eventually helps to persuade him to join her cause and free the smuggled slaves. As I said though, the plot is more of an excuse for the action. The movie itself is fun and reminiscent of a Hong Kong style action flick. I'm sure that was the intent of director Corey Yuen, a veteran of HK action movies. Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Professional) adds to the talent serving as co-writer and co-producer.
The disc contains both widescreen and full screen version of the film in dolby 5.1. The picture looks great.  The sound is pretty good, but I did think the bass track should have been a little more pronounced, particularly during the many explosions. Maybe I'm being too picky here. The extras include some extended action sequences. They are unfinished, but do include an interesting commentary track from Statham and producer Steven Chasman. There's also a making of feature.
No doubt about it, the Transporter is an action junkie's movie. Guys will definitely enjoy it, and it is a worthy addition to your action film library. Fans of HK style action flicks will also be pleased. Others will be content to rent it.",1051228800,,1667,4.788194444444445
1833861,4,B00008AOVL,"Looking like a Brit version of Bruce Willis, Jason Statham made his debut back in Guy Ritchie's classic crime caper/comedy ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.""  Since then he has been given a few side roles here and there in ""Snatch"" (or Lock, Stock 2 as I like to call it), John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars"", and then he teamed up with Delroy Lindo to track two Jet Li's in ""The One.""  But who would've guessed that he finally got his own film, and a kick [butt] action film at that.  Ever since Corey Yuen and Luc Besson collaborated on ""Kiss of the Dragon,"" I knew that any film they did together from then on would be golden. And ""The Transporter"" definitely lives up to that standard. Sure there's nothing new here: how many times is a bad guy gonna get a change of conscience over a hot chick, right? And unlike the others, there is actually some good chemistry going on between our hero and his damsel in distress.
Basically, the film combines some great European atmosphere (The beautiful southern coast of France) with some incredible fight and action sequences. Corey Yuen could pretty much create a fight scenario out of virtually any environment. Now I know you could easily replace Staham with Jet Li, but you know what? He really proves that he can hang with the big boys in this film. I mean, he did ALL HIS OWN STUNTS. How awesome is that? Not even our great American action actors like Sylvestor and Arnold can say that. My only criticsim of the film is that I think they should of beefed it up a little bit and went for the R rating. Other than that I think it's a great little action/martial arts movie with a European flavor. It will definitely make you reminisce over the days when Van Damme and Seagal used to make great Action fliks. I can't wait to see what Turkish has in store for us next. Ladies and Gentlemen, a new action star has been born.",1051228800,16,1873,4.438953488372093

This movie caught me right from the beginning, and other than a few slow-moving parts, never let go. I never noticed once that the plot may have been thin, as I saw it as a basic deal-gone-sour/revenge movie. Not sure what the nay-sayers were even talking about there- Maybe they were expecting Oscar material.

Jason Statham's character is as cool, collected, and thorough as he is lethal. I was totally shocked to see that with all his physical prowess, Statham is not a martial artist per se'. I have seen it 3-times already, and it's a welcome addition to my DVD collection.",1051056000,,665,4.588235294117647
1833863,4,B00008AOVL,"From the trailers, you wouldn't know it. But not only is this film fun and frantic, it's inventive and well-choreographed in a Jackie Chan-esque way. The hero is not one dimensional, but is surprisingly likeable and sympathetic. We see his nature unpeeled throughout the film (well, as much as is possible in such a film, anyway), for example, his strange reticence regarding killing his opponents, and his struggle between the discipline of following his rules and breaking them.
The French Inspector is another likeable and intelligent character (I guess he didn't vote for Chirac), and their standoffish relationship provides another touch of human interest and heart to the film - more so than the female lead, whom I found somewhat annoying - mainly her voice/accent and screaming. There are a couple of minor twists, nothing shocking.",1051056000,,840,5.1838235294117645

The Transporter serves up martial arts and shoot outs in abundance, and should keep just about anyone who enjoys this genre on the edge of their seat.
 Before this film, lead actor Jason Statham was unknown to me. This film definitely put him on the map for me, and should hopefully rocket his career into many more films. Mr. Statham backs his cool, calm acting method in this film with solid sequences of fighting finese.
  As for the lead actress, well...WOW!
  Stylish and slick, this action masterpiece is one of my MUST SEE films for all fans of the genre. Rent it, buy it, see it...you won't regret it. 5 out of 5 stars.",1050796800,,789,4.607142857142857
1833865,5,B00008AOVL,"The Transporter is very entertaining, because of an explosive mix both on and off-screen.  Off-screen, French directing teams (some from Ronin) created awesome cinematography and driving scenes, mixed with Yuen-driven (the credited director) hand-to-hand action scenes, all mixed with--of course--Jason Statham's fighting prowess.
On-screen, Statham has a rare combination of actual acting and physical prowess.  Shu Qi is beautiful, and her character has more going on than just to be saved by Statham (some viewers apparently missed this).  There is also an apparently well-known French actor who works as a semi-friendly inspector, and he does a great job.
Problems with the movie are predictable for something so action-oriented: plot holes, some impossible stunts.  It also has some unique problems, which add to the movies's charms: such as French criminals high and low speak American English (?), Statham tries to do the same (and gives up halfway, like Costner in Robin Hood but reversed), and Shu Qi and the French inspector are at times unintelligible.
But at a basic level, the movie is all about Statham kicking ass, about Shu Qi looking beautiful, and lots of explosions over a sunny European seaside setting.  It all comes together nicely (if often absurdly), and is highly recommended to those who need a truly nonstop action title to round out their collections.",1050710400,7,1379,5.307339449541284
1833866,4,B00008AOVL,"This movie was incredible. The action scenes are some of (if not the) best scenes I've ever seen in a movie.  The oil fight is without a doubt the most original and best fight scene ever made, in my opinion.  Statham is a perfect fit for this role and delivers a flawless performance, as you can't help but like him after seeing what co-actors he has to work with.  If he can make a movie good with these people, he's the man.
However, if you're looking for a deep movie and great acting, beware.  There is, well, no story what-so-ever, and there isn't a plot to be found.  The acting, um, ...; with the exception of Statham and his detective friend.  But, if you're able to lighten up a bit, you can be entertained by the poor acting and sorry story, as I found myself laughing at them in several spots.
There was just one other qualm I had with this film:  the soundtrack.  I'm sorry, but hip-hop background music just doesn't cut it here.  It is really begging for some hard rock music to get the audience's adrenaline up in some of the fights, but trust me, the fights can do it on there own.
Bottom line-if you want action BUY IT.  If you want a well written and well-cast classic, STEER CLEAR.",1050710400,8,1199,4.3125

1833868,4,B00008AOVL,"Keanue Reeves? Matt Damon? Ben Afleck? Those pretty boys are the best action stars of the next generation? C'mon, these guys are more concerned with whether or not their clothes match than actually being the next Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood, or Sly Stallone! Have I lost all hope in Hollywood's future action films? Well no, because I saw a little gleam of hope when I watched The Transporter.
Unlike most recent Hollywood action movies that use Martial Arts (The Matrix, The Bourne Identity, Daredevil) The Transporter brings something different to the table -- a star with authentic toughness. Jason Statham has style, a cool British wit, and the toughness to back it all up, something that OTHER ""action"" stars have been lacking. Although The Transporter may not be an overall better movie than recent action flicks, I would still gladly watch Statham beat the [pooh] out of a bunch of guys than watch Keanue Reeves do ""Kung-Fu"".
The DVD is of pretty good value. The DVD itself contains both Fullscreen and Widescreen versions (Widescreen is the better of the two) and three language tracks to choose from. The extras are all pretty good as well: a Behind-the-Scenes featurette, audio commentary by Statham, a threatrical trailer, and 15 minutes of uncut fight scenes with optional commentary. The fight scenes are the obvious draw here and they don't disappoint. I warn you however, that once you watch the uncut fight scenes, you may feel a little shortchanged with what was left in the actual movie.
Overall, The Transporter was a terrific movie, and it makes an even better DVD. You action fans who are tired of special effects, pretty boy action stars, and overdone camera angles rejoice! The Transporter has FINALLY arrived!",1050537600,,1734,4.982758620689655

Cool car chases, especially at the beginning.  Some creative action/fight scenes, especially the one involving motor oil, and another with a shirt used as a weapon.  The end came to quick and wrapped up too fast for me.  Likewise the end scene was way too corny and C rate.  I've been waiting one year for Transporter to come out on video.  Some of the scenes would have been better to see on big screen.",1050451200,,671,4.338709677419355
1833871,3,B00008AOVL,"I will start off by saying that I enjoy Jason Statham's work in his other movies besides Ghosts of Mars. Snatch was a great movie. This movie should begin to give Statham a name in the industry in America I hope. I want to see more of him and less of that ... Vin Diesel.
This movie was terribly directed. The music is really dumb and constantly missused. Some moments that should have no music have some dumb techno playing that kind of ruins the moment. Some scenes are overly dramatic due to the use of the music. The music of a movie may not seem like such an important thing when it is done well, if it is done bad however,it creates noticable problems for the movie.
The story of the movie was well not existant which for some action movies it is not such a bad thing, but it is so bad when you compare it to the creativity of the fight scenes you find yourself saying ""okay just skip to the next fight scene."" Also the effects they try with the bullet tracers on the guns should have been tossed out. It was a little too cheesy I thought. I did want to see Statham gunning down more foes with those two silver handguns that he has on the promotional poster (which he never has two at a time)though.
The acting was so-so. Not bad on Statham's behalf, but I absolutely cannot stand the guy that was in Fast and the Furious and Blade II. He is a terrible actor and should be kicked out of the industry. I am always glad when he is killed in the movies.
To sum things up, if you want a watered down PG-13 action movie (would have been better at an R rating)that you can fast foward through without having to worry about what is going on  this is the one for you. But if you prefer well written, directed, and musically scored action movies such as the Matrix

The stunts are amazing: from the opening car chase to the multiple battles featuring Jason Statham vs. Large Group of Bad Guys.  I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not say ""Whoa!"" at least ten times throughout the duration.
Statham holds his own in his first starring role, sometimes shirtless and covered in oil (a little something for the ladies).  He proves to be the right mixture of brood and mystery needed for this type of action hero.  And anyone should be impressed with an actor who did a lot of his own stunts (either that or his stuntman is a perfect doppleganger).
Overall, the movie is great fun, but it's not to be taken seriously.  There is a plot that attempts to keep the movie going, but it's only a tiny distraction.  Corey Yuen's direction and the fight choreography are classy enough to make this a better action movie than some.  Need I even mention Steven Seagal's recent debaucles?

It's about a man known as the transporter (played by Jason Statham - Snatch) who does exactly what his title suggests: transports. If somebody needs a case, a package, or even a person delivered to a destination, he'll do it if you give him enough money. He takes no names and doesn't want to know anything more than the weight of the object he is transporting. He runs his business with iron-fisted rules. Oh yeah, this man is  hardcore...
But the transporter makes a mistake. On a routine job, he parks his BMW on the side of the road, gets out, and opens the trunk to find that the package is alive. No, the package isn't alive, but what's inside of it is. It turns out to be a hot Asian girl, and she causes nothing but trouble. From this point on, it's war.
The transporter makes the wrong people mad, but he takes care of business. He makes it evident that he has the talents of both James Bond and Bruce Lee.

In fact, ""Kiss of the Dragon"" was one of my all time favorites.  But ever since Van Damme & Segal started making stuff that mostly made it to the video stores and not the big screen, it seems that there have been a lack of non Asian martial arts movies available.
In my opinion, there is only one scene that really blows.  The scene were after Stracham has kicked everyone's ..., goes looking for a car, finds a black Mercedes, and the girl is in the back seat, still tied up to the chair.  This was a poor decision by the director to keep that scene in.  They should have edited the script before shooting that scene, and made it appear that she was able to untie herself from the chair and successfully hides in the Mercedes.

Anyway, after getting hired to transport a large package to a man who goes by the name Wall Street he gets a flat tire. Opening the truck where the package is to get the tire the package is moving around. Frank becomes overpowered by curiosity and opens the package to find Lai. He gives her a drink and allows her to go to the bathroom and then delivers her to Wall Street(after chasing her in the woods). Wall Street ask's if Frank could transport another item. Unfortualty it's a bomb to kill Frank for opening the package but luckily it goes off while Frank is taking a break. Frank goes back to Wall Street and then steals his car. Lai follows and begs him to let her stay with him. The two fall in love and learn Lai tells him that her family and 400 other Asian's are being sent the Wall Street and his thugs to become slaves. It's illigal in ever single way. Lai and Frank are agast when they learn that Lai's father is in on it too and they try to stop Wall Street and Lai's father in the action packed movie of the year.
The Transporter has an equal share of drama and action. When it's in drama you could actually feel what the character's are feeling. When it action it simply a thrill ride. When The Transporter came out in theatre's I was going to wait for the DVD release but I am really glad that I didn't.
ENJOY!",1036454400,,1871,4.273239436619718
1833891,5,B00008AOVL,"This movie is EXTREME.  The opening scene sets you up for a rollar coaster ride.  I absolutely adore Jason Statham and this movie showed a side of him I haven't seen before.  In this movie, he proves he's a very diverse actor.  He was fantastic as Bacon in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" which is absolutely hilarious.  And He was excellent as Turkish in ""Snatch"".  But ""THE TRANSPORTER"" surpasses any of his previous movies.  Was I impressed?  You better believe it.  Would I recommend this movie to anyone?  I'm recommending it to everyone who enjoys a good action flick.  So... GO SEE IT, RENT IT, BUY IT.  I KNOW I GOTTA HAVE IT!  That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  :)",1036022400,,685,4.463414634146342
1833892,4,B00008AOVL,"Jason Statham is the Transporter.  For the right price he will deliver your package wherever it is supposed to go, no questions asked.  Unfortunately he makes the cardinal mistake one day and finds out what the package is.  His employers take exception to this and the action/adventure slugfest is running at full speed.
This movie has a mediocre plot (the romance that blossoms and the immigrant storyline is somewhat cheesy) that is quite simply saved by the impressive direction and choreography of the action.  I have previously seen Statham only in supporting roles but here he proves that he has the ability to carry an action lead.  Sure, the character is the familiar quiet man who doesn't want to be pushed, but when push comes to shove he is more than able to deliver.
I found the movie to be well shot, extremely stylish, and somewhat substantive.  If anything, it was the best action rush in awhile at the theater.",1035763200,,926,4.75625
1833893,3,B00008AOVL,"""The Transporter"" is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as ""credibility.""
Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  ...
In addition to Statham, who makes for a very ""cool"" action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome ""complication"" that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.
""The Transporter"" is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.  Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",1035676800,,1422,5.1695652173913045
1833894,4,B00008AOVL,"British actor Jason Statham is as cool as any Hollywood male action hero actor, even though this is his first lead role as such.  This guy has got some serious talent!  So what if Guy Ritchie can't make his wife Madonna look pretty on the silver screen.  He discovered Statham on the street corner of London while he was just a con-artist and gave him the opportunity of a lifetime by casting him in his very successful ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels""(just a bunch of British guys having fun on the set) and the even more entertaining ""The Snatch"" (Brad Pitt as a Gypsy bare-knuckled boxing champion).
In ""The Transporter"", a script written just for Statham by French filmmaker Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element"", ""La Femme Nikita"", ""The Professional""), Statham plays Frank, an ex-military turned for-hire get-away man for thieves and criminals, who tries to professionalize his lucrative trade with his ""rules"" and disciplined preciseness.
Frank's quiet and carefully protected world is turned upside down when he unwittingly breaks one of his own rules - ""never look into the package"" which he delivers for clients, and finds the beautiful face/body of Lai, starring Taiwanese actress Shu Qi, the conscientious daughter of a Chinese human snake-head who tries to foil her criminal father's plot to smuggle Chinese immigrants into France.
If you like ""The Hire"" film series made by BMW to showcase their product line, you'll love the adrenaline-rushing car chase scenes featuring a BMW driven by Statham himself, who has done his fair share of street racing in real life.  But this is just the start the film off.  The incredible physical prowess of this ex-British-national-champion-high-diver, which make Hong Kong director Cory Yuen's elaborately choreographed martial arts moves much more enjoyable than the typical Jackie Chan-style-action, makes you wish that the fun never ends.
You quickly ignore how silly the rest of the plot is because of the superb acting by Statham and Francois Berleand who plays a French detective with a sense of humor.  Seriously, would you complain about the dcor if you are ordering takeout Chinese?
See it on the big screen to fully appreciate Statham's performance, and buy the DVD for the hardcore action scenes that got cut.",1035590400,3,2269,5.086021505376344
1833895,1,B00008AOVL,"I have been a fan of Jason Statham ever since 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch'. Then, he got very bad roles. He did away with his british accent in 'The One' and he sounded like ... Now in the 'Transporter' he does the same and it seems the whole cast has a hard time speakin English. Set in Europe, the film starts off with an awesome car chase, one on par like the ones in 'Ronin'. The movie looks to be everything that I had hoped for, a good solid action movie. As the movie progresses it falls flat on its face having the audience hate the dialogue and wishing they had a remote control so that they can fast forward to the action scenes. From the irritating repetition of the transporter's rules (he only has three but he repeats them over 20 times), to the uncomprehendable english of a french liutenant AND a chinese lead actresss this movie MAKES you hate the other people and things (such as bad script) surrounding Statham. Overall, I absolutely hate the story, I hate the characters, I hate that I actually paid to watch this movie in the theatre, and I hate that this charismatic actor is getting lousy roles. But, and a big but... I'm still going to buy the DVD for the solid action scenes and that's all. I will only be going thru the scene selection for watching this movie in its entirety is an absolute waste of time.",1035244800,6,1328,4.358870967741935
1833896,4,B00008AOVL,"The Transporter will take any package anywhere with just a few simple rules: no names, no changes to the deal, and NEVER look at the package.  When he breaks one of those rules to find out he's carrying a beautiful Oriental girl, things go wrong.  When the guys he's delivering her to try to kill him, things get worse.  When they underestimate him, it's their turn to pay.  This is a good movie with a lot for everyone.  It has a few long car chases (the first of which quickly becomes absurd with one of his tactics of escaping the police - but keep watching and it'll get better), a few fight scenes, a love story, and various gun battles.  Enough for any action fan.  The star is really believable as The Transporter (he reminds you a lot of Bruce Willis in the first ""Die Hard"" movie - hopefully his career won't be stuck in the same rut though with ""The Transporter 2: Transport Harder"" and ""Transport With A Vengeance"" or something).  The movie has some great moments, but also has some mediocre ones.  All in all though, I'd have to suggest it...most likely for a rental though.  Still, a great movie from director Corey Yuin.  I look forward to his next.",1034640000,4,1163,4.438679245283019
1833897,4,B00008AOVL,"Corey Yuen the director has churned out enjoyable Hong Kong type actioners for some time.  He's always seemed to exist in John Woo's shadow.  He churns out enjoyable sturdy films (usually with Jet Li) but somehow just short of the brilliance and originality that John Woo wowed the world with.  He continues in that vein with The Transporter.  A thoroughly enjoyable but (with the exception of the lead performance) unremarkable action film.
Jason Stratham plays a mercenary transporter who will transport anything for a fee no questions asked.  He has a set of fixed rules that he follows without deviation.  On one mission he breaks his own rule and opens the package that he is assigned to carry.  The result is his life is in danger and he has to take on the mob to live again.
Stratham is the stand out here.  Even though the script barely flushes out a character for him to play he manages to convey the essence of his character through the set of his jaw, the tenseness with which he holds himself, his clipped responses. It's a beautiful physical performanc and enhances the film even without the humor that Jackie Chan or Harrison Ford often convey in their best work.  He moves well in the action sequences and is fit without being an overmuscled Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Diesel type.
Unfortunately, Stratham is the only actor who stands out. Qi Shu who plays the female lead seems to just squeal and seek protection.  She seems almost creepily suppliant to Stratham.  The villains seem pretty generic as does the Francois Berleand as the detective after Stratham.  Berleand's accent is so thick that I couldn't even understand him when he was talking about Proust. Fortunately, his dialogue scenes are brief.
If you're looking for action, the film delivers on all counts in numerous beautifully shot and staged car chases, explosions and martial arts style fights.  Except for one or two implausible plot points the script is efficient and sets up a nifty premise (though I still have a feeling there is a truck not accounted for by the end of the film).  The movie overdoes the hip-hop and music blasts.  The music seems so generic and just there to add market value that it takes away from the atmosphere of the film.
Still a decent film with a great star making performance in it.  I hope Stratham does more work in the future.  He really does have a powerful range and a sense on how to convey a character well in the cartoon world of action films.  This is not as easy as it seems (witness Vin Diesel's work in XXX or Cruise's work in Minority Report)--Stratham should have a bright future!",1034640000,4,2610,4.698901098901099

1833899,2,B00008AOVL,"I was extremely disapointed at this movie. The first ten minutes set up the story. The ""transporter"" transports things from one location to another. Whatever you need moved, he will take it, no questions asked, and get it to where it needs to go, no matter what. That's the deal. The first ten minutes contained one of the coolest car chases I've ever seen. I was sure the movie would be excellent. Sounds kind of cool right? Wrong. It went downhill from there, in a hurry.
Somewhere in this movie there was a plot. In one scene, there would be a great deal of plot involved, and in others the plot seemed to be forgotten.
There are some movies that can make up for not having a good plot by having good action. This one doesn't fall in that category either.
By far the coolest parts in this movie are highlighted in the commercials. The car chase scene is from the beginning, the rockets blowing up his house, the fight in the mansion where he does that awesome double kick (and where he rings the doorbell and then kicks the door down), the fight scene in the bus station where everybody gets covered with greese, and the chase at the end where he kicks through the windshield of a moving semi truck. That's what they show in the commercial, and that's the only cool parts.
No surprises here. If you liked ""kiss of the dragon"", with Jet Li, then you'll probably like this one. If you thought ""KOD"" had a stupid story, and didn't have as much action as you thought it would, then you'd definitely not like The Transporter.
It was a good try. It had a lot of potential, but this one will definitely gather dust when it comes out to rent. Go only if you can get somebody else to pay for your ticket. Else, wait until it's not a ""new release"" and rent it then.",1034553600,,1758,4.3465045592705165

I don't do a lot of reviews on Movies because I never want to give away to much, some times its better if you don't know what to expect. Like I did ((smile)) I didn't know what the HECK this movie was about my boyfriend and I saw it this weekend. He selected it because he happens to like the Producer (the dude who did Le Femme Nikita)and the Director other works (he does the Martial Arts choreography for some of Jet Li's and Jackie Chans movies). Anyway needless to say I didn't know what to expect so all I could be was either pleasantly surprised or hate it. LOL
The role of the ""hero"" is played by Jason Statham from ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" although in the previous flicks he didn't have as much Martial Arts action as he did in this one. Plot not much kind of far fetch and not clearly pointed out but the ACTION!! this guy is incredible! The movie opens with this slamming car chase scene the music in it was the BOMB!! (very Hip-Hop) it never took a lull (in my opinion) you were on a Fast Pace ride.
He is a transporter of anything.... NO QUESTIONS ASKED. He is good at what he does, precise and meticulous. Of course something happens while he doing a job and ALL HELL BREAKS loose. There is a woman Qui Shi (Japanese action fans will remember her from ""A Man called Hero"" fame) that's thrown into his world and with her comes trouble (same ole scenerio)but here is where the plot gets fuzzy and suspended belief needs to come in. You never really know if he should trust her or not and their are some stunts scenes that are again............  you need to use your suspended belief theory here in order to still enjoy the movie. Overall a good movie I recommend seeing. Had a very Euro feel to it, the setting is beautiful Nice, France.
Understand that the 5 Stars is for the Action and the Soundtrack if I had to take into account the Plot I would probably take it down to a 3 1/2- 4 but seeing as it is one I liked enough to say immediatly after the movie I will buy this DVD when it comes out..... I figure that is a pretty good sign for 5 Stars.

1833902,3,B00008AOVL,"In The Transporter, Jason Statham (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels/ Snatch/ The One) proves he can handle the action star persona that Vin Diesel isn't quite up to, even if the movie he displays it in ain't so hot. The most disturbing problem (and by disturbing, I mean it irritates ever other second) with The Transporter is it's poorly constructed soundtrack. During the action sequences it attempts to implement off genre songs (in hope of irony, maybe?), as done in Office Space or Sexy Beast, but it doesn't work well in this setting. The most despicable part of the soundtrack, however, is the overly dramatic mood music used during the ""emotional"" scenes. This is about enough to make you want to throw popcorn at the screen. That brings me to another problem with the film: namely it's alternation between ""emotional"" and action sequences, with no real story to drive either of them (not that the action needs a story, it does fine without one here). I can see what the director was aiming for, only showing you things from the perspective of the main character--who doesn't know the story himself--but the practice of this idea doesn't play very well. Still, this is an action movie, and thus, delivers better in that area than any other this year (though The Bourne Identity is a better film overall). The chase scene in the beginning is nothing short of stunning in every imaginable aspect and the fight scenes (especially the one involving oil) are brilliantly choreographed and directed. See it while it's in the theaters for these things alone and you won't be disappointed, I doubt you'll want to watch it much past that.",1034467200,2,1641,4.822695035460993

Rule(s) Number 2:  Enjoy the French, martial arts, and don't take yourself too seriously.
Rule Number 3:  If you can't follow the first two rules, then don't go to this movie.  But if you can, then you'll be pleased to find a fun romp though the countryside with enough high caliber fire, head splitting martial action, and curvaceous female attractions to keep you entertained for the duration.
Here's the lay down.  Ex Special Forces operator, Frank (Jason Statham ) is the transporter, a deliver anywhere, anytime, anything kind of guy.  Frank goes about his business with strict rules: no names, no changing the deal, and no opening the merchandise.  He's so good at following the rules that the police know he's involved, somehow, just can't prove it.
 As the previews share so well, Lai (Shu Qi ) is the merchandise.  Once Frank breaks his own rule, opening the package, he has let the Lai out and calamity follows.  Of course that's what we wanted, and apparently, that's what she wanted too.
The chase scenes aren't measurably close to what the fast car connoisseur will be willing to settle for, that is unless you like seeing ample abuse being given to a BMW.  The stunts don't register, either.  Parachute jumping and bullet dodging have long since been taken to their reasonable ends.
The fight scenes are enough reason, in and for themselves, to go and see this movie.  Nothing new, granted, and you can find yourself getting tired of the narrow corridor scenes until you see interesting uses made of metal doors.  Every decent martial arts movie needs a fight sequence to hang it's belt on, and you'll find one here, and never look at a drum of oil the same again.
Apart from that, don't look for a plot.  I still haven't figured out how the girl ended up in the bag.  The characters do a well enough job of smoothing things over, though.  The street savvy French investigator, Tarconi (played by veteran Franois Berleand)  pairs up well with the quiet and athletic Frank.  Shu is a stunning surprise.",1034380800,4,2077,4.735376044568246
1833904,4,B00008AOVL,"I have been waiting for a long long long time for a credible action movie. With a great leading man and awsome action sequences and the time has finally come in the form of the Transporter.

That's why he now does a don't ask don't tell jobs of ""transporting"" goods for dubious characters. He is very precise and strict. This is what has kept him alive so long. That is until he breaks his rule of not opening the package.
Jason Statham is a kick back to action heroes of the 1960's. No male posturing, mouthing off or trying to look pretty. He just does what he has to do. Nuff said. The action sequences---especially the martial arts are incredible. It really is a marvel to watch Statham in fight scenes. The reason I am giving this film 4 stars  instead of five is because the last third of the movie decends into silliness.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE TRANSPORTER [2002] Here we have Director Jet Li and the combination of the latest attempt by the French one-man film industry Luc Besson to produce a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and especially throughout the film, where you get to see Jason Statham do some totally awesome and very dramatic over the top driving sequences in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France and also in Paris, France with the Black BMW 7 Series M760Li xDrive V12 luxury car that will take your breath away and is to some people, if not better than what you will see in some of the James Bond films and check out the audio commentary comments to hear about some hair raising moments. Filmed mainly in the South of France, and adding to this action packed film is of course Jason Statham, who is one of England's rising generation of macho style stars, who holds down the lead as the taciturn reserved and uncommunicative professional driver for criminal undertakings, and the accomplished French actor Franois Berland, a familiar face in art-house films joins in the fun packed film.

Franois Berland plays that beloved stock figure of French crime thrillers, as the police Inspector Tarconi who knows and respects his adversary Frank Martin [Jason Statham], and gets to share a coffee with him while he plays a waiting game in trying to find out if Frank Martin was involved as a driver in a latest bank robbery. Lai [Qi Shu] plays an even  more conventional role of a package Frank Martin [Jason Statham] has agreed to deliver, bound and gagged in his trunk, to a bunch of shady operators led by an American known only as Wall Street [Matt Schulze] who you get to hate big time.

The plot unfolds routinely enough, where Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin falls in love with Lia [Qi Shu], and together they take on the evil Wall Street, a smuggler of Chinese refugees who is in cahoots with Ms. Qi Shu's own father figure Mr. Kwai [Ric Young]. But directors Corey Yuen and Louis Leterrier, keeps the exercise moving with stylishly executed car chases, shootouts and kung-fu confrontations, one of which finds an unarmed Jason Statham polishing off what looks like a dozen criminal henchmen adversaries. Frank Martin breaks all his own rules about remaining neutral and gets personally involved in a complicated plot involving people-smuggling, over the top gunfights, and some equally amazing martial arts action.

The film starts off on a high note, with Frank Martin picking up four criminals coming straight out of a bank robbery. What follows is an excitingly staged, perfectly edited car chase through the streets of Paris that works with a few standard jokes directed at police officers who cannot seem to apprehend one driver no matter how many units of backup they call in. This is our introduction to Frank martin, showing him at his fastest, funniest, and cleverest action hero. Jason Statham mugs, he punches his weight, and he is very funny, very strong, and he is a lot more of a threat than he appears.

Once Frank Martin is established as a quiet, sophisticated loner, he is given another package to deliver. Aroused by a newfound curiosity, he opens the package and discovers that it is a young Chinese woman Lia [Qi Shu], who is most likely on a hit-list, but after Frank gives Lia a moment to herself, she escapes and sure enough complications arise.

Later, we discover she is connected to the smuggling of 400 Chinese people in The United States and the threat of their execution. Though she is not directly behind it, Frank Martin has his suspicions. The real villains are the father of the young woman Lia, who is a businessman named Wall Street [Matt Shulze] whose line of work is so vaguely described and is definitely the definition of a nasty belligerent over the top  movie villain that we all love to hate. Jason Stratham is delightfully cool as the imperturbable Transporter, and Qi Shu brings us a cute face, but despite a poor command of the English language, brings a love interest/woman-in-distress role opposite Jason Statham. Matt Schulze is imposing as the nasty bad guy that we all hate on first impression, as well as throughout the film and eventually and deservedly gets his due comeuppance, especially being an absolutely terrible cardboard cut-out and one dimensional actor.

The action sequences are virtually non-stop, with only the occasional brief interruptions to facilitate minor exposition. Every example of hand-to-hand combat that would feature in lots of martial arts and the bonus of high kicks abound, and enough explosives ammo that could be expanded to supply a small army. The film opens with an amazing thing: a car chase that is not at all boring and it is so outrageously over-the-top, that it is just a great deal of fun packed action that really gets the adrenaline kick in. Overall, THE TRANSPORTER film will definitely satisfy anyone who is on the lookout for a really good and over the top action flick and definitely THE TRANSPORTER film destination moves at great pace and is well worth viewing and especially adding to your Jason Statham film collection.

Blu-ray Image Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment brings you this awesome action packed film in an amazing 1080p image presentation that really enhances the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Although this film was released in 2002, during which time a sequel has been released and Jason Statham has cemented his action-star status, but this film still looks like a new release. The image quality is top notch and looks far superior to more high-profile 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Blu-ray launch titles such  as 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'Fantastic Four.' The film sports a very clean slick look and the visual design aspects are highlighted with very glossy and punchy colours, with lots of shiny surfaces and, during interior scenes, nicely stylized lighting. Blacks are really excellent, and the contrast is really bold, but not blown out of all proportion in the high end image presentation. Without a doubt, THE TRANSPORTER film on this Blu-ray disc delivers an appreciable upgrade over the standard inferior DVD release. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment presents this Blu-ray disc with a clever and active sound design comes through nicely in a 5.1 DTS HD lossless mix. The disc also offers us a choice of three audio presentations of English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Italian: 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and English: 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo Audio. Music and sound effects are an integral important aspect of this film, and at times are interchangeable with all elements are well represented throughout the sound design at various points, providing a spacious feel with a very immersive experience. There is also a nice audio balance with the dialogue, which is not obscured at any point in the film. I really liked the punchy sound design experience of this audio presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Jason Statham and Producer Steven Chasman: First up to introduce himself is Jason Statham and then informs us that Steven Chasman is sitting next to him and are here to input their personal comments on the film who of course were personally involved in this film. The opening shot in the multi-storey car park was shot in Niece and they spent six weeks shooting schedule in that part of France. Jason comments on the Black BMW 7 Series M760Li xDrive V12 luxury car he drove in the film, that has a manual shift and is one of a kind and felt very lucky and honoured to drive it and also comments it was very fast, and the gadgets he got use made it very special to drive, and when he use to watch James Bond films, always dreamed of those special fast cars and now his dream has come true in this film. When we see Jason drive off with the three bank robbers and all that extremely fast driving through the very narrow streets were filmed in real time and most of the time no stunt driver was used and the authorities allowed all the streets to be shut down to interact with the police cars chasing Jason and unfortunately the police eventually do not get there man. The house owned by Jason takes the young Chinese girl Lia, who in the morning makes breakfast and especially bakes the Madeleines de Commercy and when the Police Inspector turns up and gets to eat one the Madeleines and in reality hates and detests the taste and nearly throws up, and in-between shoots Jason and the crew had a good laugh with the situation. As to this house of Jason, that was located in Cassis, Bouches-du-Rhne, France, was built especially for the film and of course we get to see what happens to the house when the gangster henchmen let their fury on it and all the locals came out to film the shoot on their video cameras, but with the film crew had 15 cameras to catch every moment of its destruction and some of the stuntmen got injured. When we see Jason in the prison cell who talks to the actor Franois Berland who plays the Police Inspector, well Jason says he was a very funny person to be with in-between when the cameras have stopped filming. When we see Jason at the Old Port of Marseille where they filmed with the containers and both commentators state that it was totally freezing cold and was a five day shoot, and with the dramatic fight scenes around the containers, Jason informs us that he suffered with very bad grazes with all parts of his body. As the credits roll up the screen, Jason thanks us for watching the film with their audio commentary, and hoped their comments were not boring. Jason also comments that when he first watched the finished film, he was very pleased in what he viewed and also watching the film with all the bad acting scenes cut out and feels the whole experience was very rewarding, especially what was filmed in what they created and especially filming in the very nice locations and felt very rewarded in seeing the film again, and brought back a lot of good and fond memories and feels the film looked really beautiful, and Jason felt the people he worked with were very talented people and again comments that he is very proud to be involved in the film. All in all the audio commentary was quite interesting in hearing Jason Statham talking in a very personal manner, but sadly there were too many silent gaps, but despite this, you should still view this audio commentary, as we hear some very interesting comments about the making of the film.

Theatrical Trailers: Here we get to view five Original Theatrical Trailers and they are as follows: THE TRANSPORTER [2002] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:27]; BEHIND ENEMY LINES [2001] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:35]; SPEED [1994] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:47]; FANTASTIC FOUR [2005] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:33] and THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN [2003] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1:13].

Finally, THE TRANSPORTER film is a great deal of fun, down-and-dirty action packed film, the type we like to view. It is unapologetically politically incorrect, features sleek visual style, and Jason Statham at his best. This Blu-ray release is a pretty good. The transfer and soundtrack are generally excellent, although Fox continues to not deliver many extras on its initial Blu-ray titles. If supplements are important to you, the you may have to wait and hope for a more extensive remastered Blu-ray disc in the future, but suspect this will not happen. Otherwise, overall the film THE TRANSPORTER is good enough to take out for at least one spin, or even more, if you are a fan like me of the awesome Jason Statham action man. Highly Recommended.

7981033,5,B00008AOVL,"The Transporter is a frenetic Hong Kong fueled kung fu actioner set in France but theres no disguising its roots. I don't know if Statham had a break out role before this but hes a serious badass in this role and this is the role that put him on the map in a big way. This is the first and the best of the Transporter series and it never overstays its welcome. There are several times where there are extended action sequences set to techno beats with no character dialogue for several minutes and it completely works. Credit visual and action-oriented directors Louis Letterier and Corey Yuen for one fast, exciting ride.",1512345600,,622,4.5625

I understand that this is supposed to be in the ""fun shooter/bond girl"" category but Jason's rules are just as cheesy as his predictable relationship with the heroine. I felt like this movie gave me nothing but a few nice vistas of France.",1511654400,,294,4.566037735849057
