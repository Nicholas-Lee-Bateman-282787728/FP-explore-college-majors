7035639,5,B00UBY7LDY,"Excellent for reducing tinnitus. I tried several CDs and DVDs to reduce noise of tinnitus in my head and it was this specific video that brought me a satisfactory result. This noise tinnitus reminds me the sound of a pressure cooker or the presence of several crickets in my head. This video ""Lavender Fields"" has beautiful landscapes of France. The photo and the quality of images are great. I enjoy to have a ride in France so easily just by watching a video. The sound that accompanies this virtual tour allows you to forget tinnitus. One can watch the image during an activity but can also only listen to the sound when going to bed and having difficulty falling asleep. I also suggest to ad in the room lavender oil diffuser or bamboos sticks with this fragrance, to complete the experience.",1428710400,,796,4.652482269503546
7035640,5,B00UBY7LDY,"My favourite scent is Lavender, so I had to have this new Virtual Walk DVD!  Just the thought of being in the lavender fields of France was enough and I purchased it from the creators website www.worldnaturevideo.com (where you can watch a trailer).  The 3 walks are beautiful and very serene, isolated from the stress and noise of modern city living.  The HD quality of the video is great!  For people who prefer streaming or downloading a digital version, you can get these from their website too.  I don't own a treadmill, but I use these Virtual Walks DVDs (I have many) with my stationary bike for indoor cycling and the pace is just right for a leisurely bike ride at moderate speed.  I must say that the trailer doesn't do this DVD justice, because the full DVD is much nicer than the trailer.  Some parts of the video are almost like a tapestry, with beautiful shades of green, gold and the purple of the lavender blooms.  You get to see some farm buildings along the way and pass through some stone-walled towns. I usually play 2 walks continuously for a 40 minute ride, but you can do all 3 for a full hour.  It also loops for a longer workout. Very nice DVD for walking/jogging or bike riding!!",1427673600,5,1205,4.465753424657534
7035641,3,B00UBY7LDY,"This was kind of average quality I felt.  Well, it does the job, it does make exercise more pleasant and less onerous, or I would've given it less stars.  But there are a number of changes that would only improve this DVD.  Firstly, it seems to have been shot when the lavender was past its best, should've been shot during peak lavender flowering I feel.  Then it should've been shot using a wide angle lense on the camera, because walking along I can see only a thin strip each side of the beautiful scenery.  Occasionally the camera does stop and look out over the scenery, but I felt like there were a lot of other places I would've wanted to look at more closely.  A wide angle lense would've made this possible.  Another thing is that it seems to be filmed in super low definition.  I don't expect high definition, but for the price I paid (converted to NZD plus postage) I feel it could've been a bit more professional.  I also want lots more lavender, I've never seen the lavender fields in France, but I've seen pictures and I don't feel this video does them justice.  I really think this DVD would be so much better with a remake, the same routes would be fine, I just want to see a bit more of them.

Some pluses: it is very smoothly filmed which is great. It also did make my exercise on my cross trainer fly by, so it does fit the purpose for which it was designed.  The routes were well chosen, they were quite lovely.",1469664000,3,1432,4.302238805970149
7035642,5,B00UBY7LDY,"Excellent quality.  It is like you are walking in France!  I love that there are cars and people in a few of the scenes to make it real.

I wish there was a optional music track(classical, energetic or soft music).",1468800000,,214,4.3

7035649,5,B00UBY7LDY,"This is a BEAUTIFUL walk DVD. All 3 of the walks are quite different and each has their own merit, but my absolute FAVORITE is Walk 1. The scenery is gorgeous and you really feel like you're walking there along the path! But the BEST part of it (for me anyway) is the solitude of the walk. No distractions  - just you and the beautiful scenery - just the way I like and need it! The second track is great also with the beautiful colors of  red rocks, ocean view and green vegetation, Corsica has fantastic scenery throughout, but the third was was my least favorite - just too much activity for me to be able to concentrate on peacefulness. But don't worry, Walk 1 gave me everything I needed to de-stress and relax and MORE. This is a beautiful walk DVD. It makes you want to go there in person! Tony Helsloot did a great job once again with the photography - this DVD makes me happy!!",1441411200,,886,4.267857142857143
7035650,5,B00UBY7LDY,"Crystal turquoise ocean waves and pristine sandy beaches abound on this exciting DVD.  Adding this to my exercise routine has given me a reason to walk a little longer, just to enjoy the sounds of the waves and the lush vegetation.  You can almost feel the sand on your feet as you jog or briskly walk the beach...

There are the standard three 20 minute walks that are featured on all the Virtual Walks DVDs. Each walk is a different beach setting some are very tranquil, while on others you may pass an occasional jogger enjoying the day or witness the coming of a storm with increased waves, distant thunder and increasing winds.  I especially enjoy the storm clouds, wind and more intense waves of walk #3.  The magnificent sunset on walk #1 is worth the price of the DVD by itself, it is relaxing and most enjoyable.

High quality sound and professional, high quality HD with stabilized filming make this video very realistic.  Great way to spice up your mundane exercise routine.",1434758400,,985,4.658959537572255
7035651,5,B00UBY7LDY,"I love lavender and I love this DVD.  It is actually one of my favorites, because it is so tranquil and provides such a peaceful walking environment.  This DVD offers three twenty minute walks filmed in high quality HD through beautiful countryside, small villages with stone walls and along lovely brilliant purple fields of lavender.  The colors in this DVD are magnificent.  I enjoy burning a lavender scented candle during my exercise session which in my case includes my gazelle.  These walks provide a good workout for an exercise bike, treadmill (great for a walk or a jog) or a Gazelle.  Sometimes I play my own music in the background or just enjoy the sounds of crickets and birds on the DVD.",1434758400,,702,4.713114754098361
7035652,5,B00UBY7LDY,"Wow, what spectacular scenery of the Mediterranean Sea complete with the sounds of the waves as they come ashore.

There are three 20 minute walks on this DVD.  The first one is slower and you are walking completely alone on a gently sloping trail surrounded by colorful plants and wildflowers.  As you slowly walk the dirt path, it is just you and the stunning views of the rocky coastline.  This is my favorite of the three walks and is great for a cool down after the other two walks.

Walks #1 and #2 are a more brisk pace workout.  #2 is along an old country road where you'll see other people walking, but no automobiles and enjoy rocky ocean views and a lighthouse.  The last one is along the shore of a busy harbor town where you'll pass boats and enjoy a brisk pace surrounded by the sounds of the water lapping at the dock and the bustle of the busy community.

I've never been to Corsica, France, but after watching this video I'd like to visit.

High quality sound and HD professionally filmed tracks can be looped for a longer workout.",1434758400,,1048,4.416666666666667
7035653,5,B00UBY7LDY,"This is a great DVD for me!  The beautiful rocky coastline and colourful vegetation make the craggy hillsides look like fascinating giant rockeries.  It is so invigorating and my exercise sessions seem to fly by.

The sounds of the seabirds and waves lapping on the shore increase my enjoyment; and there is a lovely blue sky with white clouds above me with the glorious deep blue sea below.  Moving through this picturesque towns quayside with luxurious yachts large and small, it is like being a tourist in this wonderful part of the world.  There are restaurants and shops with people bustling about, and it feels as if I am really there on holiday.  In the distance across the bay there are ancient walls that look like a historic fortress.

I must say with its marvellous views and lovely, fresh atmosphere, this is one of my favourite DVDs for my exercising.",1432598400,,864,4.72
7035654,5,B00UBY7LDY,"This program is a great way to exercise, and it generates wonderful feelings of invigoration and well-being for me.  The scenery is beautiful with verdant green hills and many rows of lovely, deep purple lavender in bloom; and the wonderful cloud formations amid the bright blue skies add to the relaxed summery atmosphere.  I sometimes use lavender scents to enhance my enjoyment as I watch.

The invigorating sounds of birdsong and crickets merge with a church bell ringing across the hillsides.  I enjoy moving through the small French village; it is pleasant to walk along the mix of small lanes and footpaths past farms with green grass and golden fields of wheat.  In one section, there are picturesque buildings on the hillside to the right and glorious lavender fields to the left.  I find this DVD really calming, and the time seems to pass very quickly while I am exercising.",1432598400,,885,4.866666666666666
7035655,5,B00UBY7LDY,"With this DVD the workout on the treadmill makes a lot more fun. Walk 1 leads to very narrow paths through beautiful vegetation, in the background you can often see the mountains and the sea. In Walk 2 you walk a narrow coastal road, sometimes uphill  then downhill again. At many places you have a great view of the beautiful blue Mediterranean Sea and the very blue sky. Later, you walk through fascinating green vegetation and run on to a lighthouse. In Walk 3 you jog between pedestrians along the harbor and you can look at very beautiful and luxurious yachts which are moored there. A very impressive landscape can be seen in this DVD, backed by realistic nature sounds. A very successful DVD, with which makes exercising a lot more fun.",1431129600,,743,4.628787878787879
7035656,5,B00UBY7LDY,"I couldn't wait to walk through the French lavender fields.  Have read about them, and this is definitely the closest I will come.  This lovely DVD contains 3 walks (although it could probably be used with a stationary bike as well as a treadmill), and it displayed beautifully on my HDTV.

Walk 1 provides a leisurely pace taken on paths going by meadows, lavender fields, wheat fields, and trees, and is accentuated by bright blue skies and clouds.  The nature sounds (birds and crickets) only enhanced the adventure.  The only thing missing was the scent of fresh lavender in the air!  Quite relaxing and with no outside interference  just pure nature.

Walk 2 starts on a mountain road above a small and picturesque village.  I loved the varied scenery while the road wound down into the valley.  Enjoyed the occasional building and even a car once in a while.  This segment showed more of the countryside, as well as the lavender fields, and was totally delightful.

Walk 3 starts off by coming into a French village.  The stonework is amazing, the roads are narrow, and the church bells were wonderful.  The walk then opens up into meadows, farmlands, and lavender fields, and is accentuated by the fabulous sounds of nature from birds to bees.  You still walk by the occasional farm and cottage, too.  Its an absolutely stunning snapshot of a French rural area.

I think this DVD is perfect for either exercising or just relaxing.  Personally, I liked Walk 3 the best as I felt immersed in not only the beautiful scenery and lavender fields but also the ambiance and warmth of the French countryside.",1430611200,9,1607,4.760869565217392
7035657,5,B00UBY7LDY,"6 Stars! - The views!!   are absolutely breathtaking!  In Walk 1 you are totally alone with nature, walking along a coastal dirt track, admiring the stunning views to the deep blue ocean and nearby islands/coastline, with nothing but the sounds of the wind, the waves and some seagulls.  It is very different from other walking videos in the series, in that you are not walking on a flat surface, but gently up and down small rolling hills at slow pace.  Nice change!  In Walk 2 you continue at a more brisk pace on an old coastal road (no cars, some people), with more breathtaking views to the bay and culminating at a pretty lighthouse.  Walk 3 takes you walking through a very nice large marina, with its luxury yachts, boats, outdoor restaurants and nice atmosphere!  You can watch a trailer of this DVD on the producers website www.worldnaturevideo.com where you can also buy the digital download version of each individual 20 min. walk.  I use my Apple TV with some digital downloads from this company and they work very well. Stunning HD quality! - Beautiful scenery and a must have walking DVD!!",1429920000,3,1104,4.708333333333333
7035658,5,B00UBY7LDY,"With this DVD, I can get the beach to my house, even though I live hundreds of miles away from the coast. Wave noises accompany the workout with the DVD, so I really have the feeling of being on a beach. The three walks offer everything what you would expect on a beach. Sun, sand, blue water, palm trees, green vegetation, blue sky, but sometimes dark clouds over the sea, which look like an upcoming thunderstorm. There is also a sunset, so you can walk along in any weather or at any time of the day at the beach. My favorite walk is walk 2 with its white beach and lush green vegetation, but even jogging under dense dark clouds is great fun. With this DVD exercising is a great pleasure, as it gives an immediate holiday feeling.",1429747200,,734,4.326086956521739
7035659,5,B00UBY7LDY,"This DVD is ideal for a relaxed workout, it exudes a sense of infinite peace. Here you meet almost nobody and only occasionally a car comes by. You only can hear birdsong and the ringing of bells. Whether you want to work out on the treadmill, exercise bike or stepper, everything works perfectly with this DVD. The speed of the video works with any of these. Sometimes you pass rocks, but you also pass by a small alley of a village, then again you can see the width of the lavender fields. The colors are very soothing and beautiful to look at. A very nice DVD where it all fits together.",1429142400,,590,4.324324324324325
7035660,5,B00UBY7LDY,This is such a tranquil dvd. It's perfect for an early morning walk. You walk or ride through the fields with all the of the beautiful purple lavender. You hear all of the birds & crickets & it is so peaceful. On the other walk you come up on a beautiful village with the sound of bells and then walk through more fields & see cottages. Just a great dvd to get you day started.,1429056000,,377,4.04

8705259,5,B00UBY7LDY,I bought this DVD to use with my treadmill and I love it!  It's filmed to look like you're actually walking outside. You hear birds chirping and see the grass and trees swaying when the wind blows.  Some scenes take you past a Marina where there are people talking and they look your way as if you're actually walking their way. It beats staring at a blank wall in the exercise room.,1520985600,,383,4.305555555555555

I like the 'in town' walk which i found hilarious with people moving out of the way.  Very interesting.  I really like these videos and they help keep me on the eliptical longer.  I would recommend this DVD and am going to see if there's one 'woodland'  by the same company.",1485993600,2,387,4.380281690140845
