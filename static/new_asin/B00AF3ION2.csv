8550736,5,B00AF3ION2,"With Easter around the corner, children can have a double dose of Easter episodes with ""Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Collection""  which comes with previously released ""Dora the Explorer"" DVD's ""Dora's Easter Adventure"" and ""Egg Hunt"".

Does your child enjoy ""Dora the Explorer""? Or perhaps you are a parent who wants their children to watch a safe, educational animated show on DVD? With ""Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Adventure"", children will be treated with a new Easter Adventure episode (featuring new and more detailed animation, a move up in terms of production quality for the series) and also this latest DVD release includes two bonus episodes ""The Grumpy Old Trolls Gets Married"" and ""Dora in Troll Land"".

In this Easter release, ""Dora's Easter Adventure"" features Dora and boots as they are waiting for the Hip-Hop Bunny to visit them for Easter and bring them the Easter Eggs needed for the big Egg Hunt!

But when Swiper swipes all the eggs from Hip-Hop Bunny's basket, Dora and Boots will need your help to make sure that it will be a Hop-Hop-Happy Easter!

For the bonus episodes, ""The Grumpy Old Troll Gets Married"" features Troll excited about his wedding but Troll needs to get to his wedding, but obstacles are in the way. Can Dora and Boots help Troll get to his wedding?

For ""Dora in Troll Land"", Dora and Boots are in Troll Land and not sure how to find the Grump Old Troll. Can you help Dora and Boots?

For ""Dora the Explorer: Egg Hunt"", the following episodes are featured:

  Egg Hunt - Dora and Boots need pre-schoolers help to find all the eggs including the Big Yellow Egg.
  Dora, La Musico - The townspeople are having a musical parade and Senor Shush locks all their instruments in the Music Box, can Dora and Boots save the day?
  El Dia De Las Madres - It's Mother's Day! Help Dora gather ingredients for Mami's cake and help Boots, Benny, Tico and Isa to prepare their Mother's Day gifts.
  Pablo's Flute - Pablo had a magic flute but lost it.  Can Dora and Boots find it?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Adventure"" may be heading to a new direction animated wise as the animation is much more cleaner. The backgrounds are well-detailed and CG generated. Even Dora, Boots and friends seem to have more shading for their colors and more frame animations. Even the map is now entirely in CG. The special is presented in full screen but is vibrant with the bright colors. This is probably the most detailed ""Dora the Explorer"" episode I have seen thus far.

The bonus episodes also feature a more CG art backgrounds but you can tell that with ""Dora's Easter Adventure"", the production for the Easter episode is more detailed and vibrant.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital and dialogue and music is crystal clear.

""Dora the Explorer: Egg Hunt"" features episodes from 2004, so picture quality is not as good as vibrant ""Dora's Easter Adventure"".  There is a bit of compression but children will more than likely not care about the picture quality.  Audio is clear and understandable.

  Dora's Easter Adventure: Interactive Play Mode - Help Dora Explore while watching ""Dora's Easter Adventure"", your child can use a remote and clicking a button when you see an Easter Egg.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I know for my family and I would assume for many other families, ""Dora the Explorer"" has helped a lot of children. May it be to introduce them to Spanish or increasing their decision making skills, the series continues to be popular in America and in other countries.

And with the release of the ""Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Collection"" set featuring ""Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Adventure"", the series takes a bold step forward in terms of look and quality. I am not exactly sure if this is how ""Dora the Explorer"" will look from here on in but if so, parents will happy to know that the series features better animation and backgrounds that are detailed and colors that are much more vibrant. I was pretty impressed with how things look and when you watch this Easter episode, compared to the two bonus episodes, you will notice a bump up in animation and art backgrounds.

And as a bonus, you also get the older ""Dora the Explorer: Egg Hunt"" DVD featuring episodes that deal with an Egg Hunt, La Musico Parade and Mother's Day and more!

My young son literally grew up in his young toddler years watching Dora and through this series, it was very helpful in helping him develop skills on decision making and also learning a little Spanish. And I'm a true believer that these educational children's shows is one of the reasons why he is doing so well in school.

I can easily remember watching him and seeing him really get into the series and taking part in the challenges. And now he's older, doing exceptionally well in school but he has done well since kindergarten and even pre-school and I would like to think that children's series such as ""Dora the Explorer"" were one of the reasons for why he is doing well.

Where most of the ""Dora the Explorer"" TV shows have been instrumental in teaching children Spanish and counting as well as teamwork, the same can be said about this latest DVD.

As for special features, you get an interactive game and also karaoke music videos, so you can sing along with Dora and Boots.

Overall, ""Dora the Explorer: Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Collection"" is great DVD set for parents or relatives looking for safe, educational episodes for children. Parents who have other kids that grew up in the series, will note the more modern and updated look of ""Dora the Explorer: Easter Adventure"" in the latest Easter episode featured on this DVD, especially quality differences compared to the older ""Dora the Explorer: Egg Hunt"".

""Dora the Explorer: Dora's Easter Collection"" is recommended for parents and their young children!",1364601600,2,6612,4.754385964912281
