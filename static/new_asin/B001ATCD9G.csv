8279618,3,B001ATCD9G,"I actually was quite disappointed with this one since I already knew sewing, but in my opinion it's a great dvd for home sewers who want to improve and/or learn how to sew.",1408579200,,172,4.242424242424242
8279619,4,B001ATCD9G,"the video is great for beginners, learning the basic language to use patterns, stitching exercises, how to cut fabric, sewing machine recommendation, etc. Overall the instructions are clear, but its not recommended for advanced.",1338422400,,228,5.735294117647059
8279620,3,B001ATCD9G,"Coni's DVD is very, very basic starting with loading a bobbin.  I checked out this DVD from the library and feel a bit dishonest to write a review because I fell asleep after 10 minutes.  My impression is that it would be suitable for a teenager who has never sewn before.  If you're a more advanced beginner or even an intermediate sewer and would like to improve your techniques, I would recommend Marta Alto's DVDs.  I purchased her shirtmaking, jacket making, jean making, serging, details(lots of super info), full bust and often go back to them to remind myself just how to do certain techniques.  I watch lots of sewing DVDs and I would say that Marta is a very experienced sound instructor and I highly recommend her DVDs.  They are only about $20 or less, too!  I own all her books, too.",1313884800,10,796,4.524475524475524
8279621,2,B001ATCD9G,I thought this video would give me a little insight on how to better construct a garment.  The end result was a matronly button down shirt for a teen.  Following pattern directions would be just as easy.  Ended up returning product.,1310256000,2,232,4.609756097560975
8279622,5,B001ATCD9G,"I am a beginner student.  I went to Connie's website (fashionpatterns) and bought the following items: this DVD (it's cheaper there), the Student Packet ($9) that is used in the 1st part of this DVD, the pattern for the project (Butterick B5047) covered in this DVD, and the recommended interfacing (7927 in white).  I am halfway through it and so far so good.  The only thing that I don't seem to have that is used in the project is a serger machine to hem the bottom of the shirt.  I have not reached that section so I'll just attach my hemmer foot (can be done without a specialty foot) and leave it at that.  I got all my fabric, thread and buttons at [...] at a nice price too.  This is what you will need, besides your sewing machine and tools like scissors, to follow this project to completion.

The DVD is of outstanding quality.  Very well made, good close up shots, organized well, it does move at a quick pace but that's what the pause button is for.  All in all I am progressing well and slowly building confidence.  This really is the next-best-thing to going to a class.  Connie is a great instructor.",1271116800,24,1116,4.3951219512195125
8279623,5,B001ATCD9G,"Although this says volume 4, this dvd is not built upon knowing what is in the other three videos at all. In fact, most people learn the techniques in volume 4 and then if they become even more interested in sewing, then then learn the techniques in the first few volumes (Making a custom bodice is one of them).

This is a dvd for an absolute beginner. However, there were a few things that Connie demonstrated that I never do, for example,in the demonstration of turning a collar point with the student, Connie inserted  the point of a pair of scissors into the corner of the collar to turn it. I involuntarily gasped when I saw her do that!
 There is a very good chance that the scissors would poke a hole in the collar, and even if it didn't poke a hole, it does not make a nice sharp corner because the scissors end is too thick.

Even though its an extra step, I would not advise sewing a collar that way either, from one end to the other. Instead, start from the center of the collar and sew to the point, then going back to the center of the collar and sew to the other point. Sewing from one end to the other distorts the fabric, and even though its a tiny bit more trouble, having a crooked collar is very frustrating because you don't know how to fix it, and you will end up ripping it out, and doing it again, but its still ""off"".

I also would teach to make the stitches smaller at the beginning and ending of a seam instead of backstitching. ""They"" always teach beginners to sew this way, and then later tell them to stop doing that as it creates bulk. These are some examples of the things that are taught beginners, and then later are ""untaught""---and are in this video. Perhaps it can't be helped, and like any subject, you learn to do the basics and then you refine as you go. Collars is one of them. Mine would turn out crooked, or one end round and the other corner pointed. Another DVD, like Margaret Islander's will show you how to not have those problems. Its not in this one, probably because this is very basic.

  I give it  5 stars as a beginner's dvd, with the notations I made above, knowing there will be more advanced tips to learn or unlearn later.

 If you are an intermediate student, you probably already know these techniques as they are very basic: Sew on a piece of paper first, starting with straight lines, then curved lines, then corners. How to pick out your size pattern, how to pick out fabric for your first project, how to cut and pin the fabric without distorting the grain lines (so it doesn't twist on your body later). Even how to cut with the scissors or rotary.  Those things you have to know first, and this video shows you.",1237075200,43,2677,4.3107569721115535
8279624,5,B001ATCD9G,"First, I already sew but wanted to improve the quality of my techniques.  I live in Manhattan and fashion is extremely important here which is why I decided to go to Mood fabric stores for top cloth, and cut and sew my own. For the past 6 months I basically taught myself and then I found that Amazon happened to have sewing-lessons on DVD. I bought first the ones by Sandra Betzina.  They were badly made.  Just now, I bought and watched Connie Crawford's ""Studio Sewing Skills"" and WOW! What a difference in quality.  I was impressed by Connie Crawford's film because:  1.  the clarity and thoroughness of what is depicted (i.e., audio quality and the sense of step-by-step)  and 2. the attentiveness of the person with the camera.  I have to say that Mrs. Crawford paid very careful attention constantly to what she was teaching to the new student and that the person behind the camera did a super job of making sure he gave me (the viewer) every opportunity to SEE what I would normally want to see if I were right there in the room.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with Sandra Betzina's DVD on how to make a jacket (While I could tolerate the irritating metallic echo in S.B.'s video, I felt ripped off every time her camera person did not coordinate what she was trying to show with where he was focussing. I lost a lot of what I could have learned or seen as a result.) The bottom line is that I would like to KEEP Connie Crawford's works and return S.Betzina's.  They are beautifully organized and detailed with nice transitions between the sections.  They go quickly but with a sense of patience and caring as opposed to Betzina's nervous rush.  Honest to God, I so wished I have bought Connie Crawfords Videos six months ago!",1228003200,49,1741,4.527156549520766
