7985215,5,B00008L3XX,"This movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Charles Cullen's work reminds of early John Waters. He explores the seedy side of American culture through his satirical use of graphic violence and surreal humor. Yet, his vision remains unique throughout the film. I was very impressed with his overall style. In this day and age of over wrought, over hyped Hollywood films, it is nice to know that there are those out there that still make subversive films like this one. Although I'd like to see Cullen get a little mainstream attention, it's neat that he flies under the radar. I'm not giving spoilers here, just check out this work of art.",1123286400,,632,4.552631578947368
7985216,3,B00008L3XX,"This is an odd one. The titular character ( played self-indulgently by the writer and director, Charles Cullen) is a fashion-challenged, southern-drawling long-haired dork  we are supposed to accept as a fearsome bounty hunter, but ends up being as geekily unbelievable as Steven Seagal .
The gore is plentiful and appealing, but the lack of budget shows through like a cold sore through makeup. The minimalism of some of the interior sets and shots recall H.G. Lewis at his worst. There is enough humor and irreverence to show promise, but the slapdash story and lack of cohesiveness ultimately undermine this low-budget effort.",1066003200,,629,5.166666666666667
