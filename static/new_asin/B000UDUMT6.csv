8213032,3,B000UDUMT6,"This video provides a historical look at an under canvas circus. The show is a one ring circus with a European style tent which is unique in its erection. Watching the video one realizes the hard work it is to each day erect a tent, care for the animals, present two shows, tear down, and move to the next engagement. Circus fans will appreciate this video while non circus fans will appreciate the historical value of this DVD.",1233100800,,428,4.5
