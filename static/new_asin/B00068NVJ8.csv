2175410,5,B00068NVJ8,Received the DVD set in a timely fashion. The item was sealed properly...Great buy! Would buy from seller again!,1268006400,,112,4.947368421052632
2175411,5,B00068NVJ8,Not only is Jamie a great artist but he is also a hilarious comedian. I suggest this set to everyone.,1258675200,,101,4.1
2175412,3,B00068NVJ8,"package came in less than a week.  Box was damaged and not indicated when i checked out, but the discs were in good shape as promised.",1251763200,,134,4.153846153846154
2175413,3,B00068NVJ8,"I'm very happy with this product. Jamie Foxx is straight guts!!!

It just took a little bit longer than I expected for the cd's to get here. Will do business again.",1234396800,,164,4.290322580645161
2175414,2,B00068NVJ8,"I tried hard hard, but couldn't find a single DVD that I enjoyed in this collection. What a waste of money! Jamie is a better actor and singer than he is a comedian. I might have laughed8 times through all three discs- not good enough. Perhaps I expected too much from Jamie. He just isn't witty enough. He has that schoolground bully type of humour. You can just picture him being the bloke that took the mickey out of the poor kids with low self-esteem. Don't get me wrong, I am no prude and I love irreverence and political incorrectnes, but I feel like Jamie tries too hard. I don't think that comedy comes naturally to him.

This box set is definitely worth a miss.",1172361600,,670,4.36
2175415,3,B00068NVJ8,"The package's general condition is good. However, one of the movies is scratched. The first day i played it, it froze on one part, and now it does the same thing every time. I'm hoping I can fix it with some alcohol or something.",1140739200,,229,4.2272727272727275
2175416,5,B00068NVJ8,"Jamie Foxx is the best comedian on the planet. He keeps you on the edge of your seat with his comedic style, not to mention his unbelievable singing voice. The Texas native has finally been brought to the world and this DVD proves it.  I can't wait until he drops another album!",1124150400,,278,4.346153846153846
2175417,5,B00068NVJ8,the show was ok but the man looked good! DANMM JAMIE!! WHEW!,1115078400,,60,4.083333333333333
2175418,5,B00068NVJ8,"Straight from the Foxxhole is definitely one that needs to be in the DVD collection.  I've been waiting 12 years to own a copy of this.  From the previous review, it sounded like the DVD came from the street bootlegs of chinatown.  It is not as bad as described.  There was about 15 seconds on the DVD where poor ""tracking"" was visible on the video, but the sound was unaffected.  The clarity of the video, overall, was good.  If you're a fan of Jaime Foxx, then this set is a must have...you don't need a review to tell you to buy this set!!!!",1110067200,3,544,4.233009708737864
2175419,1,B00068NVJ8,"all three of these performances are great, but the reason i'm giving this one star is because ""straight from the foxxhole,"" though hilarious, looks like ABSOLUTE SH*T. it was copied from a VHS recording and the tracking screws up on and off during the whole thing (pretty bad during some parts). really it looks like a bootleg. other than that its great, but its hard to believe this is the kind of transfer we get on an official DVD.",1106352000,14,434,4.506329113924051
