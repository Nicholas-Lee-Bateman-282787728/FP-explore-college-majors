6425188,5,B00KGA85L0,"I greatly enjoyed this DVD. I missed the broadcast of this program this year. The DVD has the full program and extra features as well. The extra features include interviews with the performers as well as the full-length Dickens play and an interview with the people who engineered the mechanism that allowed Charles Dickens and The Ghost of Christmas Present to fly above the audience. The concert includes a performance by the organist, Richard Elliott, on the magnificent organ, with its five manuals. During his performance of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, Elliott at one point performs Flight of the Bumblebee on the pedals with his feet while still using his two hands on the manuals. Later in that song, the organist adeptly switches his hands between the manuals at an astounding frequency. He even uses both feet at one point, separated by an octave. Soprano Deborah Voigt is a solid performer; her voice is powerful and without shortcoming. I especially enjoyed The Holly and the Ivy, as well as Coventry Carol. John Rhys-Davies is great as The Ghost of Christmas Present.",1421193600,,1080,4.93956043956044
6425189,5,B00KGA85L0,"Great service, I received the DVD before Christmas which is what I had hoped for.
The DVD itself was fabulous. Thank you!",1420416000,,121,4.545454545454546
6425190,2,B00KGA85L0,A nice program but you should realize that the guest soloists are opera singers. They have magnificent voices but we are not opera fans.,1420329600,,136,4.708333333333333
6425191,3,B00KGA85L0,"I LIKE SOME LIGHTER OPERA, BUT FOR ME I DON'T APPRECIATE DEBORAH VOIGT IN THIS TYPE OF SETTING. PROFESSIONAL OPERA SINGERS JUST CAN'T PUT AWAY THEIR TRAINING SO NO MATTER HOW PROFESSIONALY SUNG IT DOESN'T RING RIGHT TO ME. A LITTLE TOO FORMAL WOULD BE THE WAY I WOULD WORD IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING ANY OF THE PREVIOUS 3 SEASONS UNLESS, LIKE ME, YOU BUY THEM AS SOON AS THEY'RE AVAILABLE.",1418860800,,391,4.444444444444445
6425192,4,B00KGA85L0,Great program.  Seems like every year it gets better!,1418860800,,53,4.888888888888889
6425193,4,B00KGA85L0,"The Mormon's best effort to date, but with John Rhys-Davies how could it miss?  Very enjoyable.  I take one star off due to the uninspired, recycled, recostumed dance choreography.  As a musician I dare suggest the organ solo was the overwhelming highlight of this show.",1417651200,,270,4.955555555555556
6425194,5,B00KGA85L0,"This show is marvelous.  But it deserves a High Definition 1080p Blu ray release. I know that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir produces on its own label, and so they must grapple with monetary issues. Nevertheless it's disheartening to see this appear without the blue case. The Choir has produced two of its Christmas specials on Blu ray in the past, and has elected not to now--I'm sure for a reason. But DVD is old technology; the discs have a short lifespan in years before they begin to deteriorate. And as one's eyes become ""educated"" to high definition, a lessor picture simply seems like a let-down.",1416960000,2,602,4.733333333333333
6425195,5,B00KGA85L0,"Each year the Festive offering by the 360-voice Mormon Tabernacle Choir is more magnificent and breathtaking to the eyes and ears than the previous year - and this one `Let the Season In' is certainly the most visually spectacular of any past productions.  For anyone who has seen the live stage musical of `Mary Poppins' and was in awe when Mary Poppins flew over the audience in the show's finale, well `Let the Season In' tops that, but I won't spoil the surprises for you.

You must see this wonderful Christmas show to experience the eye-popping sequence, `A Dickens Christmas' - the story of Charles Dickens at the time of writing his novel `A Christmas Carol' and starring the esteemed Welsh stage, screen and television actor John Rhys-Davies (`Lord of the Rings') and a very competent cast of speaking actors, which makes this production fly above anything else you have seen in a long time, especially in such a vast auditorium.

I have been an avid fan of the Tabernacle Choir since the time that I was training as a TV director at KSL-TV in Salt Lake City in 1958 at the age of 21.  In that year I had the privilege of working on the very first coast-to-coast TV show of the choir for CBS-TV's `The Music of Christmas' special from the old Tabernacle at Temple Square, before returning to Australia where I had that show screened on television at Christmas 1959.  It was the first time the Mormon Tabernacle Choir had ever been seen on TV 'down under.'  So forgive me if I am somewhat biased when it comes to the exquisite voices of the Tabernacle Choir and the magnificent 100-piece concert orchestra at Temple Square conducted by maestro Mack Wilberg, who accompany the superb voice of operatic soprano Deborah Voigt.  Her interpretation with the choir of the 16th century English carol, `Coventry Carol' (`Lully, lullay, thou little tiny child') will bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened heart.

Miss Voigt also sings `The Holly and the Ivy' and `There Were Shepherds Abiding in the Fields' and Bach's `Et exsultavit spiritus meus' with the clarity of an angel.  She also shows her wide range of talent with the fun song `The Twelve Days AFTER Christmas' and a light-hearted Christmas Medley including `We Need a Little Christmas' (made famous by Angela Lansbury in `Mame' in 1966.  In fact I thought Miss Voigt looked very much like Miss Lansbury).

The hundreds of talented dancers on stage, the Bells at Temple Square, the period costuming, the settings, and the visual effects are beautiful to see, and especially the Corp de ballet dancing `A Russian Christmas Festivity' on point.  Mention must also be made of the dazzling organ virtuoso, Richard Elliott, and his exciting arrangement of `God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' played on the massive pipe organ with its 5 manuals, and some 7,667 individual pipes.  The organ measures 75ft wide and 42ft high behind the choir stalls.  Richard deserved the standing ovation he received.

The 84-minute program in anamorphic 16x9 widescreen is pristine with the clarity of Dolby Stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound and is skilfully directed by Lee Wessman as his cameras swoop across the 21,000-seat auditorium capturing all the color and atmosphere of an old fashioned Christmas of Charles Dickens' day with rustic cottages and cobbled streets bookending the choir stalls.  This DVD also has 41 minutes of Bonus Features, including insightful interviews with Deborah Voigt and John Rhys-Davies, and a `Backstage Making Of' documentary that will have viewers enthralled as to 'how did they do that ?'

I could enthuse further about every facet of this heart-warming musical gift, but I shall leave it up to each individual to make up their own mind when they see this stunning and spectacular Christmas program.  It will, indeed `Let The Season In' into your hearts and your minds!  And in the dysfunctional and threatening times we now experience in 2014, this entire program is a very welcome escape that will take you back to our gentler-seasons of a long forgotten past!",1414368000,10,4035,4.87280701754386
6425196,5,B00KGA85L0,"I haven't seen this yet, since it's not been released, but my only concern is that this concert will also be  available on BluRay as have several of the choir's past Christmas concerts.  It should be another fantastic musical experience.  Everything  the choir does is absolutely World Class!",1413504000,4,292,5.020833333333333

8658281,5,B00KGA85L0,"You can't go wrong with this Christmas annual tradition from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I have all of these DVDs and have just bought this year's DVD with the Muppets. It has become a family tradition to watch these again and again every holiday season. The orchestra, the choir, the dancers, the music, the guest stars--you just can't beat it.",1447632000,,346,4.783333333333333
8658282,5,B00KGA85L0,"This performance was a treat with special effects giving us a unique view of Charles Dickens when he wrote his A Christmas Carol. As in several other years, an accomplished opera singer, Deborah Voigt in this concert, sang with the choir -- her voice matched the power of the world-renowned choir and orchestra. Extras included interviews with the guests as well as how the special effects were accomplished. Altogether, another outstanding addition to our Christmas Concert DVDs. Note that the DVDs for each concert are issued a year after the concert performance and are edited from all three performances.",1428192000,,608,5.151515151515151
