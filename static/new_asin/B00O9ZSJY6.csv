8682844,5,B00O9ZSJY6,"This is a very informative, well-presented documentary on a subject about which I knew very little.  I knew about the Oso slide, of course, as it was covered by the news media a great deal at the time.  But this shows how it happened, why it happened and the techniques that helped rescue people.  The research on landslides has been going on for a long time and Nova shows some of what was done to help understand this particular slide.  It was no surprise that that particular slope would suffer a slide -- it had done so a number of times over the centuries, as have other sections of the same area.

What was a surprise was how fast and how far the slide went.  It was far larger and more powerful than the experts had thought possible.  Heavy rain is usually the prime cause, though not always.  In this case it was.  Dirt is not the best building material and, when saturated slippage increases as does the pressure to move.  Once it started to slide, the landscape turned to mud -- liquefaction is the term -- and it was over in a minute or so.

This episode covers the topic very well.",1437004800,,1093,4.334975369458128
8682845,5,B00O9ZSJY6,"This is definitely a five star documentary.  It is up close and personal in a sobering and thoughtful manner.  I live about two hours south of Oso.  At the time of the disaster there was little coverage that truly revealed the horror this community was experiencing while it was happening.  Most of my recollections of the news reports at the time had to do with delayed traffic because of bridge closures.  With time, hints of the egregious lack of proper land management by the State of Washington surfaced. This DVD elucidates, in a clear and appropriate manner, the unforgivable failure of those who held the reins of power and control who chose to ignore the land use- misuse that caused this tragedy.  It was 100% preventable.",1428192000,,732,4.76984126984127
