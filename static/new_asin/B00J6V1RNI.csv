8648576,1,B00J6V1RNI,I'm returning it. It's not in English.,1502236800,,38,4.571428571428571
8648577,4,B00J6V1RNI,"First, I will echo what a previous reviewer stated: this is a multi-region disk and plays well on my US Blu-ray player, though my TV does complain about resolution when in the menus.  My player is a strict ""rules follower,"" can never skip previews and I have a couple of DVDs from other regions it will not play, so I'm certain if there was even a question, this disk would not work.

With that said, this is a fantastic movie.  My dad brought it home on VHS back in the 80s and we and my brothers laughed hysterically throughout.  I own two DVD copies, one a bad VHS transfer and another a Hen's Tooth version which is generally negatively reviewed due to it missing a number of scenes.  The well-known missing scene I usually see mentioned is where Trinity and Bambino's father/stepfather talks about the time he met their mother.  This scene, while missing from the Hen's Tooth release, is definitely present in this blu-ray as is another scene where they are walking into the ""fanciest eatin' place 'tween here and 'frisco"" and Bambino uses the matre d' as an ashtray for his cigar.  I have not yet found a scene missing from this version.

The quality is really good, far better than the other copies I own, especially considering the movie was released in 1971.  The video is 1080p and the aspect ratio is 2.35:1.  It appears to have two separate English audio tracks: LPCM 2.0 channel and DTS-HD MA 5.1.  The DTS track is not a surround sound mix; no sound comes out of my rear speakers.  There are also two Spanish tracks in the same formats.

Edit: I learned the English audio track gets progressively out of sync as the movie plays.  By the end, it is 0.5 second off and is quite noticeable to me.  As a result, I had to reduce my rating by one star.  Still, this is the best video quality of the movie I've encountered.  I'm hoping to find a blu-ray copy of the somewhat less funny, but still great predecessor: They Call Me Trinity.",1487116800,,1944,4.461756373937677
8648578,5,B00J6V1RNI,"This review is not a commentary on the content, but rather the the specs.  Despite the warning from amazon indicating this is a REGION B/2 disck, it is in fact REGION FREE as the picture of the back cover indicate.  Yes, cover specs are often inaccurate, but I can confirm that this disc is playable on a REGION A/1 player without modification.  Region ""ABC"" (which means ""all regions"" or region-free"") is printed directly on the disc.  Additionally, English and Spanish audio tracks are included.  Video transfer is pretty good considering the age of the film and the 5.1 audio conversion is well done.  My primary reason for posting, however, is to let potential buyers know this is a region-free disc.  Amazon may want to modify the listing to prevent scaring away North American customers.",1466553600,4,793,4.873134328358209
