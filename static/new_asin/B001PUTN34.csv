3762424,5,B001PUTN34,A really impressive documental that makes anybody appreciate the natural treasures that exist in our present time. I would recommend this especial from nova to my friends and relatives.,1320019200,,185,5.413793103448276
3762425,5,B001PUTN34,"Lovingly, thoughtfully made documentary.  I am so grateful for the making of this film, for the dedication of the workers who performed the restoration, and the visionaries who funded this project.  Perhaps most of all, the opportunity to see the exquisite artwork of those who have gone before.",1308182400,,295,5.125
3762426,5,B001PUTN34,"I like Nova, because it's very educational and interesting. To be honest, i love the astronomical aspect of this series and glad mankind have prevailed through the years to keep moving forward in our quest to see where we fit in this vast universe.",1307145600,2,248,4.659090909090909
3762427,5,B001PUTN34,"I highly recommend this DVD which exposes how the National Security Agency, which  with many billions of Tax Dollars invested in its creation and operating budgets, was tracking all of Al-Quaidas communications for years and knew that their opreatives were in the U.S. and learning to fly our aircraft... well before 9/11 and never bothered to notify the FBI or the CIA.

It would appear that this DVD is quite historic and enabled the intel to flow to the proper agencies such that we have the recent good newa of the Navy Seal attack on Bin Laden resulting in his assination. If these things matter to you this is the DVD to have!

Best,

3762428,5,B001PUTN34,"I purchased this video because of my interest in the NSA as I have had with dozens of Federal agencies. The one point that struck me odd was the crash of the computers at NSA at the most critical point just prior to 9/11. The reason it was odd is because the head of the NSA at the time only said that it was a critical time for their computer system to crash, erasing all data to date and unable to track the movements of the terrorists just prior to the attack on the world trade center's two towers, attack on the pentagon and the crash of another hi-jacked plane in a deserted field. I would have been suspicious of the coincident. The timing was too coincidental. I would have suspected it was an inside job and dug further but nothing else was mentioned. Was the NSA in on the attacks? What do they know they aren't revealing and why is it the Bush administration now claims we must give up our personal privacy. Sorry, but I don't trust a government run by religions and corporations.",1270339200,9,991,4.333333333333333

It was a REALLY eye-opening look at how the people of Israel produced our modern Old Testament (OT), while they were in captivity in Babylon.  This was the 70 year captivity during the time of the prophet Daniel.  Could it be that WITHOUT that captivity, we would not have such a good copy of the OT to this day.  It turns out, the discipline of producing a reproducible manuscript was not done by Israel until this period.",1438214400,,477,4.511627906976744

It was made prior to the expose by Edward Snowden about the warrantless basis on which your every communication is being monitored by computer programs and by individuals if you are flagged for using the wrong word or in the wrong context.
You can run but you can't hide.  The thought police are here and they know what you are thinking and where you are if you are interacting in any format.
What it didn't reveal but now it is readily available is that many microphones and cameras are hidden in fake trees and light poles at malls and other large gathering places and these are also used to monitor your actions and comments.  If you think this is making you safer than think again.  They knew about Osama Bin Laden before 1996 and had been watching him and his followers.  They knew he was a threat....

3762550,1,B001PUTN34,"This review is on the episode, ""The Bible's Buried Secrets.""  It's description is:  ""A powerful partnership between science and scholarship breaks exciting new ground in investigating the origins of the ancient Israelites, their faith in a single, omnipotent God and the creation of the Bible.""  This is terrible scholarship.  It seeks to gain what the Israelites were ""really like,"" but ignores or accepts as false the things the Israelites recorded about themselves in the Old Testament.  That's like looking at our Constitution and Bill of Rights, then saying, ""But the early Americans were really against the right to bear arms, against freedom of the press, and against freedom of religion.""  For instance, they note that archeology has uncovered in Israel the idols of multiple gods; then they attribute those to the ""early Israelites""!  The Old Testament records that the peoples in the land before the Israelites had many gods and many idols.  Why ignore a primary text?",1398643200,,978,5.1847133757961785

3762553,4,B001PUTN34,Good balance of science and ideas.  Professors from many universities are interviewed.  The episode on the Bible does not come out pro or con on theology.,1395705600,,154,4.884615384615385
3762554,5,B001PUTN34,"Completely new approach to interpreting meaning and value of pyramid builders.  Takes into account the change over time in where the Nile flows and how far blocks must have been moved.  Also debunks idea that pyramids in Egypt were purely tombs of egotistical pharaohs.  Ties in pyramid builders in South America.  Suggests the structures may be older than traditionally taught in history classes.  The only part that seems scientifically shaky is the suggestion that Egypt may have used high tech cutting methods, but even that part is interesting, and based on some hieroglyphs (but no artifacts).",1394755200,,599,5.197916666666667

3762557,5,B001PUTN34,"Just a taste as far as I am concerned due to having so much background ,but a real keeper for those not familiar with NSA.  Takes more of the mystery out of the Agency.  It makes you want more if your inclined to this field of spying.  Should be popular now that the Agency is getting some publicity.  It is amazing how many years of operation that they kept the lid on until Snowden.  I would recommend this asset.",1392336000,,415,4.2025316455696204
3762558,5,B001PUTN34,I love this entire serious.  Great way to teach any age child or person about a lot of different topics.  The more you know the better understanding you get.

3762561,5,B001PUTN34,"I have been watching Nova Series, ever since it began in the 70""s.  Every episode explores some aspect of the world of science.  The episodes are always presented in a simple and interesting context.  The subject matter includes a full-spectrum of  interesting topics.  There will always be room in my TV life for episodes of  Nova.",1387324800,,332,4.839285714285714
3762562,5,B001PUTN34,This is one of the most interesting shows on all of television land. I would give it 6 stars if possible.,1386806400,,105,4.0476190476190474
3762563,4,B001PUTN34,40 minutes of information crammed into 50 minutes of programming.  Less contrived drama and more hard facts would appeal to me.,1384646400,,127,5.0476190476190474
3762564,5,B001PUTN34,"When you watch NOVA you see the product of work when a person loves what they do. One of my fave is ""Chasing the elements."" I hated Chemistry in school.

3762567,5,B001PUTN34,"The NOVA programs cover a range of topics, in an objective, scientific, relevant, and sometimes humorous manner. David Pogue is a great host. (Hope he does more.). For older students, NOVA can spark interest in scientific inquiry. For adults, NOVA can keep us up to date with the latest ""science"" which is continually learning more about our world and beyond. Fascinating programs. I highly recommend NOVA.",1378252800,,406,5.166666666666667
3762568,5,B001PUTN34,"NOVA has been a great PBS series since I was a kid--some twenty years give or take a few.

I am particularly drawn to Jane Lifshuts for her compassion, commitment and good will. I also like Jay Bonnar for showing his vulnerability and for honesty regarding his shortcomings. By the way he is very lucky to have divorced from his toxic and self-centered wife relatively early; that woman would have sucked him dry.",1375833600,,415,4.942857142857143
3762570,5,B001PUTN34,"Having spent many hours in Engineering and archeology classes this was very interesting to me - if you do not like the history of South America or are a Religious savant that believes that the earth is 5,000 years old then you will have a hard time reconcilling the information provided with what you have been told by others.",1375488000,,326,4.5423728813559325

3762576,5,B001PUTN34,"The amount of information that comes from this program is astounding, learning about how strong the partnership is between scientists and archieologists on their own thoughts and discoveries of new and exciting paths with investigating the origins of the ancient Israelites, their faith which was originally open and included idols, plus becoming a single path to praying to only one God and the stories at creation of the Bible with many hands.  A lot of information, very long program, so maybe not for the younger generation.",1368921600,,528,5.1395348837209305
3762577,4,B001PUTN34,NOVA once again proves that science and history can be entertaining as well as informative. Do you think you know the Maya and what really happened in the Pearl Harbor attack? Maybe you should watch the NOVA episodes on these subjects.,1367366400,,235,4.7560975609756095

This is the kind of TV I really like.",1366761600,,130,4.24
3762580,5,B001PUTN34,"NASA has the largest collection of linguists, mathematicians, and computer experts in America at its Northern Virginia headquarters. NOVA documents how it has transitioned from tracking the Soviet Union (a large entity with a known location) to terrorists (numerous unknown small groups, at unknown locations), and in the process also reports evidence indicating an incredible failure to protect the nation pre-9/11, even though bin-Laden et al were being monitored from 1996, starting with his satellite phone and numerous calls to/from a house in Yemen's capital. Now technology has evolved and messages mostly travel on fiber-optic cables.

The basic problem - NSA did not share information with the FBI. No useful warnings were sounded prior to the embassy bombings in Africa, the Cole bombing, or even 9/11. Their primary excuse - sharing such information was banned by law; however, they could have obtained a FISA warrant, making this legal. The 9/11 Commission did little investigation of the NSA's role and failure prior to 9/11.

NSA has transitioned from monitoring too little to monitoring far too much, lacking good computer programs for zeroing in on the most important communications. This is made especially difficult by the fact that reference to eg. 'a milk bottle' may mean something entirely different.",1366416000,,1322,5.381642512077295
3762581,4,B001PUTN34,"Nova typically produces some great scientific, exploratory episodes. This episode on underwater cave diving is no exception. The ending was a tad banal and inconclusive but the overall episode is terrific.",1363219200,,205,5.645161290322581

3762588,5,B001PUTN34,"This NOVA show featured a once-in-40-year rat population explosion that eats all the farmers' rice crop. So every 40 years there is potential famine and social upheaval. Scientists discovered the reason - the once-in-40-year blooming of a bamboo plant. This specie of bamboo produces giant seeds that have plenty of food in them for the rats. The black rats have a unique ability to multiply quickly if there's a food source.

The amazing thing about this bamboo is the ability to accurately time production of these seeds. It does so this way to make sure there will be too many seeds for animals to eat and some will produce the next generation of bamboo.

I loved this show because it demonstrates how nature is the big determinant in our lives, at least some times. At the same time, I felt sorry for the villagers that have a difficult time with food production when this event occurs.",1325030400,2,890,4.698717948717949
8334819,1,B001PUTN34,"Anyone with even a very rudimentary knowledge of the bible will see this is a very biased and misleading documentary. A simple, straightforward reading of the many biblical references they make will quickly answer most of the contradictions espoused in this episode. They also completely disregard the timeline given in scripture and make up their own. Then they go looking for evidence that matches their bogus timeline which is several hundred years in error. Surprise, surprise, they don't find much evidence when they look at their incorrect time but they claim it is the bible that is inaccurate because it doesn't match their timeline . If they would pay a little more attention to the dates and timelines given in the bible they would be looking at the right time period and find plenty of evidence as shown in other documentaries and sources such as Patterns of Evidence. This documentary is so filled with inaccuracies and clearly misleading information that I must conclude it was made to intentionally mislead people. I had always liked Nova programs but now I have completely lost faith in them to product objective documentaries.  If you watch this episode, I recommend you go and actually read the biblical references they mention to compare what scripture actually says to what nova claims it says.",1517875200,,1313,5.022935779816514
