7886425,4,6305263124,"A very good NFL films video about Big

John, the greatest QB of alltime, and

the Broncos winning a second Super Bowl

in a row. Way to go John. And a Super

Bowl win over Mr Conservative Offece,

Dan Reeves, who was the main reason

Denver lost those first three! Dan

was a very good Coach however, as his

201 wins attest to. He joins Marv Levy

and Bud Grant, a couple outstanding ex-

CFL Coaches who lost four Super Bowls.",1152748800,,428,4.172839506172839

I only wish that we could have played the Vikings...... I will love this video just as  much as the 1998 video.  GO Broncos! One More Time  Butterfly of Denver",919468800,,293,4.196428571428571
