2066257,4,B000286S1U,"TIPTOES seems to be a film made in homage to Little People (Dwarves).  Not a bad idea, especially when the gathered cast consists of some of the finest actors who incidentally happen to be dwarves.  But superimpose on this concept the love interest of people of normal height - an edgy artist Carol (Kate Bekinsale, almost unrecognizable in her artsy costumes and hairdo) and a fireman Steven (Matthew McConaughey) - and the problems of victimization cloud the scene.  Only when Carol becomes pregnant does she discover that Steven has a twin brother Rolfe (Gary Oldman in as quiet a role as we'll ever see him!) who happens to be a dwarf.  How this plays out - the coping with the possibility and eventuality that Carol's baby will be born a dwarf - is the serious side of the tale.  Enough said of plot: further information would taint the viewer.  The saving grace of this film lies in the hands of the supporting cast of dwarves (yes, Gary Oldman plays a little person - and very well!).  The enormously gifted Peter Dinklage takes Patricia Arquette as a girlfriend, the parents of Steven and Rolfe are a delight as are their friends, and the bits of humor that dot the screenplay involve the coming together of Carol's and Steven's parents to plan a wedding!  McConaughey and Bekinsale make the most of this script and the pacing by director Matthew Bright is good.  If it just weren't all so preachy...",1091664000,4,1408,4.668016194331984

2066289,5,B000286S1U,"I'm giving this five stars because it is AWESOME.  It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, belongs right up there in the pantheon of so-bad-it's-good film classics.  I'm so glad I found it. My daughter and I have been amusing each other, recalling it for days.  It's so shockingly bad.  The costuming, the dialogue, the editing, the direction. The writing. The premise.  The acting.  The special effects required to make Gary Oldman appear to be a dwarf.  You have to watch the trailer first, to see it describe his part as ""the role of a lifetime.""  Awesome.  There were some parts where we had to pause it, we were laughing so hard and had to regain our composure.  Although the film is quite preachy about accepting Little People as normal people with normal lives--which they are---it delivers the ultimate insult of having its lead LP role played by Gary Oldman.  I will point out that the great Peter Dinklage is RIGHT THERE the whole time, in an unnecessary and ridiculous supporting role. The movie includes many award winning or award nominated actors, including Oldman, Matthew McConaughey, Patricia Arquette, Peter Dinklage, and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, who is dressed as a clown the entire film, and acts like she is on 'ludes.  Patricia Arquette, a quirkier character, is dressed, and behaves like, a crack whore who scrounged her clothes out of a dumpster behind a Salvation Army, so Kate comes off slightly better here.  The plot basically revolves around Kate's pregnancy with a secret LP baby, her husband hiding his LP heritage, and totally unrealistic, hyperbolic, ridiculous reactions to just about everything, by everyone, in every scene.  Please do yourself the favor of viewing how movie magic makes Gary Oldman look like a little person while sitting on a couch. (Hint: it's like when you see Elmo's whole body on Sesame Street; we were dying.)  Please, please, treat yourself. Warning: eating or drinking during this movie might lead to choking.

One last thought: I wonder what the Little People community thinks about the existence of this film.  I blame not the LP actors in the movie, of which there are many, as there aren't as many acting gigs for them, and they can be forgiven for thinking the movie might have been sensitive and useful-- I make the leap here of imagining the original script having been somewhat reasonable, since the thing got made and such big stars signed up for it. The mind boggles at how far it went off the rails.  People of all sizes, enjoy!! .",1474329600,4,2520,4.793981481481482

2066309,1,B000286S1U,"If I could give this less than 1 star, I would. I don't even know where to start.
There are so many random story lines and plot holes in this movie, it was equally confusing as it was painful to watch.

Matthew McConaughy is born into a family of little people. He tries to hide his family background from his fianc (Kate Beckinsale), until she becomes pregnant, and his brother (Gary Oldman) shows up at their door, forcing them to have an awkward conversation about babies and getting hit upside the head with a stereo (I told you it was confusing). When she finds out what her fianc has been hiding from her, she races to his work in a fit of rage, furious that he kept that from her. The story goes on, the two main characters trying to figure out the best way to go about telling her parents about his family, how to plan a catholic/jewish wedding, and how to come to terms with them having a dwarf as a child. That's the best way that I can sum up the movie without getting into confusing details.
I have no clue why Peter Dinklage and Patricia Arquette were even apart of this movie. Their characters had nothing to do with the story line, and all they did was drink a strange combination of codeine and cognac throughout the entire movie.
I don't know what's worse; Gary Oldman attempting and failing miserably at acting as a little person, or Kate Beckinsale's wardrobe.
Throughout the movie, I often wondered what filming this movie must have been like. Were they embarrassed at what the audience and their peers would think after this sorry excuse for a film came out? Did they all realize how big of a joke it was? Were they all THAT desperate for money?
How all of their agents got them to sign up to work in this movie is beyond me. It was the biggest waste of time I've ever spent on watching a movie.",1454889600,2,1816,4.35693215339233

2066335,1,B000286S1U,"""Its the little things in life that matter"" so says the cover blurb. Not true. This film is so little and it DOESN'T matter  It should have never gotten past the pitch to ANY producer. How they attracted a fine cast is astonishing to me. The premise of a fully grown  man who is hiding from his pregnant fianc&eacute; ,the fact that he is genetically a dwarf (but full size in stature) with a twin brother( a true dwarf)and parents(who are both dwarfs ) could have possibilities. He is passing as chromasomal oddity. But alas, this film fails almost immediately. The fianc&eacute; finds out his secret when his brother comes to visit. He is played as a small person by Gary Oldman through the magic of film making. The fianc&eacute; (Kate Beckinsale) who finds out that she is pregnant, her husband is genetically a dwarf but not expressed physically (phenotype) and his entire family are dwarfs is slightly dumbfounded to say the least. Now there are questions to be asked by Kate. 1)lHow could you keep all this  from me? 2) Will our baby be a midget(politically incorrect). 3) If he is a small person will he have problems? DUH.Hushand Matt: YES HE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS . BIG TIME PROBLEMS. LIKE I WILL NOT BE HAPPY AND HIS/HER BODY GROWTH WILL BE LOADED WITH MAJOR MEDICAL ISSUES. BUT THERE ARE DRUGS LIKE MORPHINE that will help. Kate:WELL I guess that will be okay because its a baby and I will love him/her and I will read all the books about raising a dwarf child. ..  But you my husband to be are the one with the real problem. You haven't accepted who you are. (How insightful) MATT:  I need to think about this. KATE: There is nothing to think about as i am having this child. MATT: Well I need to take a ride. ..  And he comes back and they marry . She is very accepting of her new family of dwarf inlaws as they are truly charming and can not be upset by anything anyone says. Now the tall inlaws (Kates parents) come to meet their new short family who they do not know are dwarfs and finally admit to their true concern. Can the kids get married in a jewish ceremony? Okay !;
The child is born a dwarf and daddy needs to take another ride. Poor mommy as she is very accepting but is alone in all this. Then the dwarf brother shows up again and is very supportive of her and the troubles this child will experience.
The primary actors are so lifeless in their portrayals it is embarrassing . I'll bet they wish they did not say yes to making this movie. Or possible thought people will think this is a comedy. The problem is this not a comedy. It is played as a true drama. Except for the scenes with french anarchist Peter Dinklage who does try to save at least his role in this disaster. If I saw this film in a theater I would have left after the first half hour and demanded my money back. I should have read the remarks of other amazon watchers and taken their advice about this film. Kindly speaking its not very good.
The really good acting comes from the dwarf cast. There is real talent here but wasted on this film  Peter Dinklage plays a french anarchist dwarf who only likes full size sexual partners and believes the only chance dwarfs have is if they arm themselves. Now thats funny. If this was a comedy .Please. Peter does give a good performance .He is amusing.
The killer insult is that a full size actor ,Gary Oldman , plays a dwarf. Kates brother in law. I wonder why. Couldnt they find a dwarf actor to play this part. Sort of outrageous don't you think.
I was hoping to see a good film with quality actors about the lives of dwarfs. Or a film that just hapoens to have dwarf actors. But instead I watched a horribly acted screen play which  I believed insulted the dwarf community (they truly were the best actors on the screen and the only redeemable virtue). This film was doomed from the first time Matt M. took a walk .You should do the same with this film. Take a big walk away.
There are some important topics presented very badly in this film .
I love movies. I love to be informed on topics that I have little knowledge. I love to see good performances and good screen plays. This film was a disappointment in all areas.",1440028800,2,4161,4.353092783505154

2066337,1,B000286S1U,"As far as I can tell, Tiptoes is the sad story of a pretty horrible human being who is ashamed of his family's shared medical condition, who then loses his own family because he is unable to cope with his own son being born with the same condition. And yet, this was billed as a ROMANTIC COMEDY. The funniest parts were totally unintentional and surreal. For example, instead of feeling sorry for a dwarf played by GARY OLDMAN ON HIS KNEES, because he was just nearly strangled to death, I was picturing real Gary poking his head up through a big hole in the cushions of the couch he's ""sitting on."" The dialogue is awful. The ""jokes"" are not funny. The F-bombs are laughably peppered all over the place. Not one single actor gives a good performance, including Oldman or Peter Dinklage. Things happen for no apparent reason and are never followed up on. Just all in all an offensive movie in every sense of the word.",1435881600,,917,4.497005988023952

As he usual does, he disappeared into his role and was very enjoyable to watch. His portrayal of a 'little person' was realistic and sensitive. Peter Dinklage, Patricia Arquette, Kate Beckinsale were all fun, as was the rest of the cast--except for Matthew McConaughey, whose character whined about what a blow life had dealt him most of the way through the film.

2066343,1,B000286S1U,"Agony. Anger. These are two reactions you will need to come to grips with is you are foolish enough to electively watch ""Tiptoes,"" one of the most execrable movies I have ever seen. This film is so legendarily bad that I had to see it, but in retrospect I wish I had watched ""The Room"" twenty more times instead. From premise to script to acting to execution the film is horrifying. Why, oh why, would any of these actors agree to be in this? It must have looked a lot better on paper.

Matthew McConaughey plays Steven, an abusive bully who impregnates his girlfriend Carol (Kate Beckinsale, who opens the movie in the most suggestive way possible,) leading to a tiny crisis. Well a little crisis, anyway. Why? Oh, because Steven has managed to conceal from Carol for a very long courtship that he is actually a twin and the rest of his family are little people. How does she find out? When Rolfe (Gary Oldman on his knees) swings by their place and introduces himself to Carol as the dwarf twin brother she has never heard anything about. I will say this: it is impossible to empathize with any character in this movie but Oldman probably comes closest as a likeable midget impersonator. The plot also features extensive pointless diversions such as a key heartwarming family unification scene involving a sincere devotion to the Jewish faith and an epic poetry recital about flatus. (Seriously.) The two lovers get married and have a little baby resulting in no end of ranting from Steven making him even less likeable, which I had previously assumed to be impossible (""I need new chromosomes!"")  Pointlessly cluttering up the plot (but greatly expanding the running time) is a subplot about an abusive narcissistic French communist outlaw biker Maurice (Peter Dinklage with an outrageous accent) who can't shut up about Marxism while simultaneously demonstrating his lack of empathy to anyone (especially women,)  and his unsavory lover Lucy (the wholly out of place Patricia Arquette.) Their adventures meet no essential needs of the story but do serve to annoy profoundly. The conclusion is particularly creepy and involves a predictable yet entirely ludicrous bit of romance that is unconvincing, implausible, and generally icky. After I saw this I felt like I needed a shower. Just really, really, no.

Even for dedicated lovers of B-movies, independent productions, and, well, just plain bad movies, ""Tiptoes"" is a chore that seems never-ending and is tasteless and offensive in a myriad of ways. Movies about people with differences living in the ""normal"" world can be outstanding (remember ""The Elephant Man?"") but ""Tiptoes"" merely takes an unbelievable premise and goes downhill from there. Mercifully there are no extras (other than a few previews for other movies) on the DVD, presumably because everyone involved wanted to wash the stink off of their hands as quickly as possible.",1425686400,3,2895,4.987577639751553

2066363,1,B000286S1U,"To put it plainly, this is a film in which the pivotal role of a dwarf is played by Gary Oldman, waddling around on his knees with the help of a cane. Other, actual, dwarves are relegated to limited and inexplicably comedic roles with Peter Dinklage playing the most substantial of the roles for real dwarves, a random man whose inclusion in the story defies explanation. Why Dinklage would participate in this is beyond me as he is hardly unemployed. Many dwarf actors face such difficulty and cannot be faulted for taking the work but when he walked on set and saw the Oldman shuffle (did I mention he walks on his knees throughout the film, faking being a dwarf) I am surprised that he did not turn around and go home. In fact, I'm surprised the entire case and crew did not go on strike at seeing such an offensive display of bigotry.

Similar to the exceptional nausea experienced when watching Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer and C. Thomas Howell in Soul Man, sporting their versions of Black Face, I found myself pausing this to pop some Dramamine and, when that didn't work, some Meclizine, just to make my way through this genuine horror show. I haven't been this offended since watching a very white Kate Hepburn in Yellow Face as a Chinese girl in Dragon Seed and that came out during World War II.

How could Oldman do this role, day after day, on his knees, playing at being a dwarf? How much less than his most special and super talented self must Gary Oldman find dwarf actors to be, that he would have the gall to act on his knees while Warwick Davis waits in the wings and Peter Dinklage waits in the wings and every other talented male dwarf actor you can think of waits in the wings ready and able to NOT walk on their knees in a film about supposed acceptance of midgets and dwarves. Not to mention the fact that Oldman's role, as the fraternal twin of Matthew McConaughey could have been better played by Dinklage himself, who was actually born in the same year as McConaughey and not eleven years earlier as Oldman was.

I don't know if I'll ever look at Oldman the same way again. Actually, I'm pretty sure I won't. And what in the world were McConaughey and Beckinsale thinking? What, Beckinsale wouldn't ever really be attracted to Dinklage or Davis or any other highly talented male dwarf actor because she's so bigoted that they had to cast Gary Oldman to make her feel less icky?

There are so many things that just don't make any sense.  The biggest thing is that the whole premise of the movie is not possible.  Matthew McConaughey plays a normal sized person in a family of dwarfs.  He impregnates Kate Beckinsale and while she wants to have the child, Matthew doesn't want the baby because it might be a dwarf.  The vast majority of the movie is him worrying about having a dwarf baby which would not actually be possible.  Of course, it ends up being one and the rest of the movie just keeps speeding down the crazy train.

 Gary Oldman plays a dwarf.  In a movie that cast many ACTUAL little people, the main dwarf is played by (NOT A DWARF)Gary Oldman.  He spends the movie walking on his knees.  It is painful to watch.  It was probably painful for him to do ;-)  The ""special effects"" are awful.  It looks like that Tim Conway character ""Dorf"".

Poor Peter Dinkladge is a french marxist seperatist-for no apparent reason.  At one point he goes on a nonsense rant and then declares he wished he had a crepe.  Because we all know french people walk around eating crepes 24/7. His love interest is Patricia Arquette, in a role so strange I just felt bad for her the whole time. I often wondered what was going through Peter Dinkladge's mind when he was in a scene with Gary Oldman on his knees.

The movie asks us to believe that Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey-who look nothing alike-are twins, even though there is clearly a very large age difference between the two actors.  During one scene, Matthew McConaughey yells that he is a dwarf.  And yet, since he is not walking around on his knees in the movie, I know that he is not supposed to be one. This whole movie is just one unbelievable mess.  So much of it doesn't make sense, it's super weird.",1388016000,3,1932,4.398305084745763

 The plotline is somewhat unique, a couple that is having a baby and they're worried that the baby will be a dwarf since the normal sized husband comes from a family of dwarves.  There's a very weird and uncomfortable side plot but it essentially was not even part of the movie and it's absolute garbage.

So, terrible effects and stupid casting aside this movie is still awful, it's a lot of very good actors at their very worst. The costumes are outlandish but in a very poor way, the outfits look more often than not like something drug out of the garbage can behind a Goodwill. All of the characters are extremely annoying and unrealistic as well as the dialogue. They're worried about having a dwarf baby but they act like it's going to be an unearthly beast even though they are completely comfortable around dwarves at any other point in time.

This movie is only 90 minutes but it drug on to a point I rechecked the length cause I could have swore that multiple hours had passed.  I didn't lose respect for the cast, they have bills to pay but the director should be absolutely ashamed of himself, the only place this movie belongs is the garbage.

2066399,1,B000286S1U,"This movie is a whole different level of awful. How this mess of a movie ever got made would be a great story in itself. I would loved to have been a fly on the wall when the pitch was made:

Director: I know the screenplay seems like it might be in poor taste, but it has little people running around, which is always interesting because they are like regular people only smaller and it has a scene with Matthew McConaughy in his whitey tighties. Also, as Oscar bait, we plan on providing information about what a drag it is to be a little person.

Film Executive: Matthew and little people? Awesome.

 I adore Peter Dinklage and Patricia Arquette and I consider Gary Oldman one of the best living actors alive (despite the many terrible movies he's been in) so it pains me to say that my regard for them has diminished for having seen them in this film. It's that bad! The next time I see them in anything I just know I'll flashback to this terrible movie.

There is so much wrong with this film. Here's a list of the most egregious.

1. Gary Oldman is not a little person. I have no problem with the idea of casting someone who is not a little person in that part. I do have a problem when the special effects are not done well. An attempt was made to pad his trunk and backside so that he presented the typical form of a little person, but it was done so poorly. It wasn't consistent. At one point in the movie I found myself thinking of the movie Young Frankenstein when Igor's hump keeps shifting places on his back. That was intentionally done for laughs, and not suprisingly it had the same effect for this movie as well. I laughed pretty hard.
In another scene, they have Oldman's character sitting on a couch facing the camera. To make him look small, he was obviously sitting beneath the cushions so that only his trunk was exposed. Stuffed, short legs were than placed at an angle to the cushions. So help me, poor Oldman looked like a Muppet. It's not easy being green!

2. Peter Dinklage as a drunk, ill-tempered, Marxist, with a French accent that sounds more like a Russian accent?!? Patricia Arquette as a floozy, hippie who can brawl like a man?!? David Alan Grier as some famous guy who's longest scene is having sex with a little person on a table at a party?!? WHY???? The main characters have very little interaction with these characters, so what's the point?

3. Did you know that one should always use the term ""little person""  as opposed to the term ""midget"" when referring to people who are born with dwarfism? Did you also know that there are many assorted health problems associated with dwarfism? Do you also know that there are 100,000 little people living in the U.S. and that they live happy and productive lives? Did you know... and so on and so on. What a terrible screenplay. The characters in this film are forced to clumsily mouth these ""informative"" tidbits. How could those actors stand it? Did any one of them notice how dreadfully boring and didactic it sounded? A good movie shows, not tells.

4. (Spoiler)
According to this movie, there is a different standard of conduct when dealing with little people.
Apparently, it is perfectly acceptable to leave your husband, who by the way was very upset with the unplanned pregancy and who also throughout the pregancy warned you about the dangers and hardships associated with a child with dwarfism; if he is not acclimating fast enough to his worst fears come true.
 Kate Beckinsale's character leaves her husband to shack up in a cozy home (with a hot tub!) in the woods with her brother-in-law, which is fine because he is a little person which means he is special. Special people and the people that ""love"" them are not subject to the same standards as the rest of us. ICK!
What's most astounding though about this particular ending is that as horrible as the idea is, the filmmakers didn't even bother to commit to it. Kate Beckinsale and Gary Oldman have zero chemistry. There was nothing apparent throughout the whole movie to even imply that they would end up together! No heart-felt conversations or wistful glances. There was one chaste kiss at her wedding, but that hardly constitutes a romance. The second and last kiss in the final scene was so apropos to nothing that came before that I actually laughed with the sheer ineptitude of the whole thing.

So, in summation: MOVIE BAD!

If you should make the mistake of watching this movie (it's definitely riff-worthy, but it's no Troll 2) then you may experience the same sort of pain that I did by seeing some of your favorite actors debased. Allow me to suggest some movies with these actors that will help to expunge the images of their debasement.

Meanwhile, Steven's twin brother Rolfe (Gary Oldman) is on a motorcycle trip with his best friend Maurice (Peter Dinklage). The trip comes to an abrupt end when Maurice picks up a hippy prostitute (Patricia Arquette). Tiring of the noise, Rolfe decides to pay an ex-girlfriend (Bridget Powerz) a visit. Things don't go according to plan and Rolfe gets badly beaten by her current lover.

Lucy is pissed at first but with a little open mindedness she begins to accept Rolfe and the rest of Steven's family. When she becomes pregnant Steven fears their child will be born a dwarf and loses his mind. His subsequent actions are shocking and devastating to his family. The film is  strange partly because of it's handling of dwarfism but mainly because the intended comedy isn't funny. Thankfully the filmmakers don't make fun of little people but show them in a positive light not seen on film before. I assume we're supposed to laugh at the sight of Arquette as a New Age nut or at Dinklage as a murderous Frenchman but I didn't. It's not funny it's distracting. They're both fine actors but rather than add anything to the film they take away from it. This is a nice role for Oldman since he gets to show off his tender and vulnerable side.

He plays Rolfe, a journalist and dwarf brother to a fire-fighter instructor Steven played by Matthew McConaughey. Steven happens to be the only member of his family who is not a dwarf, but he hasn't told his girlfriend Carol (Kate Beckinsale) about the presence of his brother or anything about his family. But when Carol becomes pregnant, he knows he has to tell, but is still slow to do that.

The premise is intriguing in several ways - amiable Steven hesitates to talk about his family, but why? for instance - but the film, which starts off pretty interesting, gradually veers from the topic, not knowing the story it has to tell.

I know Matthew McConaughey is a talented actor, but I am afraid his acting here is far from his best. He should not be blamed, however, as his character is so underwritten and the romance with his girlfriend so undeveloped that I couldn't understand why she was attracted to him in the first place. The same can be said about the relation between Oldman's Rolfe and Beckinsale's Carol, one of the pivotal themes of the film, I think, but ""Tiptoes"" gives only about 10 minutes (out of 90) to depict its process, which should be treated with more details.

Supporting actors turn in fine performances, especially Peter Dinklage as Maurice a radical French, but the subplot concerning his love/hate relations with Patricia Arquette's character just goes nowhere, abruptly cut short before it really interests us.

Sometimes Oldman was photogaphed in a way which suggested that he was sitting on the ground, for example, in a rauncy motel room he's sitting between two beds while Patricia Arquette is rollingaround having sex with another ""little"" actor, the French Marxist firebrand, ""Maurice,"" played by Peter Dinklage, who runs away with the whole movie with his preposterous ""French"" accent saying, ""Ze marriage is for ze morons!""

I liked Dinklage's performance.  I wonder if they could use reverse special effects as cast him as a man of normal height and all the other actors could be magically shrunk to his height like the hobbit boys in LORD OF THE RINGS.  Patricia Arquette as ""Lucy"" looks rough, like she slept the whole night out in the woods the evening before she reported for duty on TIPTOES.  In the screen's most romantic scene, Peter Dinklage braids his greasy black hair into flowing cornrows in homage to Arquette's Bo Derek hairdo in a picnic slash wedding sequence.

Matthew Bright made ""Freeway,"" the nutty caper that turned Reese Witherspoon into a indie icon.  Here he's hardly as successful, but maybe he meant the picture to be as bizarrely truncated as this one.

We saw Chad Everett the other night as one of Ann-Margret's boyfriends in MADE IN PARIS.  How strange to see him playing Kate Beckinsale's controlling father in TIPTOES--and still looking pretty good all things considered.  The movie should have been about his character and had all the others sort of crossing his path at different places.  He still has the looks and charm and talent that made him an acting legend.

The acting was bad and that was surprising given the cast.  I could not feel any sort of connection between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Beckinsale - much less that they could be living together and expecting a child.

Gary Oldman is painful to watch - he hobbles around cramped into a dwarf outfit.  Very Dorf-ish.

And I have no idea what Peter Dinklage and Patricia Arquette added to the movie.  They seem like they are from a completely different movie.

On one hand, the dwarves are heroically postured as being people who physically suffer due to their ""deformity""; on the other hand, they are portrayed almost saintly and without any real cares in the world.  It also throws in the added implausibility of Matthew McConaughey as the only ""tall person"" in a family of dwarves.  When his main squeeze Kate Beckinsale becomes pregnant, McConaughey is afraid their offspring will be a dwarf too, and this is hard for him to accept.  Meanwhile Beckinsale develops a strong kinship with McConaughey's ""twin"" brother (marvelously etched out by Gary Oldman in a bizarre physical transformation), and the viewer doesn't need Cliff Notes to see where this will end up.  Clearly the script is a stacked deck...while it makes McConaughey's character seem prejudicial and uncaring, it gives us Oldman as an accepting soul who sees nothing wrong in having a dwarf for his nephew.  But then why should he?  He IS a dwarf.  While the performances are overall well done, the movie's tunnel vision doesn't allow the viewer to see a complete picture and thus we are left with nothing more than a ""cutesy"" kind of movie.",1127692800,,1533,4.933852140077821

2066460,4,B000286S1U,"This is a very very special film.  The reason it so special is  because it tells a very special story, of which I shall synopsize.

Lucy and Steven have been living together and plan to eventually get married.  However, Lucy tells Steven one night that she's pregnant.  Steven is less than thrilled.  He tells Lucy that although he did plan to have a family with her, this is too soon.  He was planning to have children years down the line.  Lucy doesn't understand why he's so upset; they've talked about raising children a hundred times.

Lucy gets a life changing surprise the next day when Steven's injured brother, Rolfe, drops by Steven and Lucy's home.  Lucy has alway wondered why Steven has never introduced her to his family.  Rolfe is a dwarf -- a little person.  Lucy asks Rolfe are he and Steven biological brothers.  Rolfe says ""You could say that.  We're twins.""  Clearly they are fraternal twins because Steven is a conventional sized tall man, while Rolfe is clearly a dwarf.  Lucy asks Rolfe if his parents are also little people.  The answer is yes.  Here lies the meat of the story.  The reason Steven never told Lucy about his family is because dwarfism is a genetic condition and Steven and Lucy have the potential to pass on the genes to offspring.

This is a story about learning to accept and deal with circumstances in your life that are out of and beyond your control.  I think it's an excellent film for our society to watcha, understand, and learn from.

I thought the acting was excellent.  I had no idea McConaughey was this good.  He's really quite an amazing actor.  Does he always get the recognition for that?  Beckinsale was also very moving.  Gary Oldman was fabulous.  He's an amazing amazing artist and I'm so glad he did this.  Oldman plays Rolfe, by the way.

There are beautiful performances all around, most notably from (surprise) Gary Oldman and Kate Beckinsdale.  McConaughey does his best to make Steve a sympathetic character - but unfortunately his efforts make the character appear more selfish than troubled, never making clear the man's inner turmoil which though hinted at repeatedly, never fully blossoms into convincing pain.

Oldman's turn at McConaughey's dwarf twin brother, Rolf, takes a little while to work, though eventually, as almost always with this actor, he reveals layer upon layer of complexity and develops the strongest character in the film.

What a treat to see Peter Dinklage - in anything - but here his misogynistic, cherry flavored morphine syrup swilling, communist French [...] is an absolute joy and Dinklage clearly revels in taking his role over the top.

Kate Beckinsdale's performance has a ring of truth about it, while being almost otherworldly and spiritual - yet with feet and faith planted firmly on terra firma.  Hers is a deeply moving performance.

Discussing flaws here is an unnecessary exercise since despite several, Tiptoes turns out to be more than the sum of its parts and funny, heartwarming and slightly enlightening movie.",1109289600,4,1383,5.2785388127853885

The respect and sensitivity displayed between the characters was refreshing.  I think tho, that you have to be prepared to watch it with a sense of half-fantasy/half-archetype; sit back and enjoy the costumes and get over the literal hangups - the same as you might have done with Edward Scissorhands.

Kate Beckinsdale shines as always in this story and Gary Oldman was fantastic!  His metamorphasis and physical challenges for this role are amazing!  Matthew McConaughey was wasted and disappointing.  Near the end, the movie finally deals with the heavily emotional charged story of two average people having a dwarf child because the of the father's background - he comes from a family of dwarfs.  This part was great and the whole movie should have started from here.  However, it choose to randomly target issues that ran all over the place but never really formed a cohesive plot (the physical pain associated with dwarfism, the twin brother issue with one being a dwarf and one average, the average child's denial of his family, the political association of the dwarf cause - which I still don't know what it is?).  All the subjects touched upon were fascinating but since none of them were given any substance, the film left this viewer feeling cheated.

Drama is built upon conflict, good movies have some sort of resolution that the conflict. This movie resolves nothing; it ends with the wife kissing her husband's dwarf brother. All the ending seems to imply is that the husband cannot change, but the repercussions are not explored. The wife never actually tries to convince or help the husband change; she just pleads.

2066477,1,B000286S1U,"... I have gripes with two aspects of the movie.

Number one:  All of the women are artificial.  From the sugar-sweet fiancee who makes a couple of (obviously out-of-line with her character and forced into the script) verbal blunders, but otherwise is perfect with a capital ""P"" -- to the perfect mother-in-law-to-be -- to the squeaky-clean, gorgeous hitchhiker with perfect hair, teeth and body.

(In contrast, all of the men are complete losers: one a drunk, one biased against his own newborn to the point of abandonment, another an angst-ridden writer who steals his brother's girl.)

Number Two:  That inexplicable source of income.  The girlfriend appears to be a freelance painter.  Yet she's rich with a designer wardrobe?  No one in the fiance's family seems to have a high-income bracket career, yet they live in a lavish house and own a cabin?  The writer that doesn't spend much time writing.  The drunk that seems to have no career at all.  The fiance that trains firefighters (I'm sure that's a six-figure income.)  And then the female hitchhiker who seems to have all kinds of Bohemien possessions -- in her knapsack?  I just don't by it.

Even in the end, the fiancee takes a newborn to live in a cabin with the writer brother (Gary Oldham), and they live happily ever after -- on what?  Her parents money?  His parents money?  His unbelievable income writing articles between changing diapers and warming bottles?

Aside from those two annoying points, it was still a dismal, dismal movie.",1095120000,7,1506,4.881422924901186
2066478,1,B000286S1U,"How_in_the_world did this movie get made? This movie is without a doubt and without reservation the worst movie I've EVER seen. I mean consider the premise--husband of attractive NY couple is the only big person in a family of little people. Wife gets pregnant; are they going to have a lizard baby? or a little person? or what? And the title, ""Tip Toes"" (with the classic running line that only hollywood could write ""Because sometimes its the little things that count."") Is that title because the husband tip toes around the secret? Or because everyone has to stand on tip toes? Or what?

How bad is it? It was so bad that the only reason I can think this movie was created was as a result of a lawsuit in hollywood, and one of the terms was to create a movie employing all the little people they could round up. It was so bad that it was actually outclassed by another movie we rented -- a shark movie starring Lorenzo Lamas called ""Dark Waters"". Yes, consider the implication of that statement: a shark movie that blew all it's budget hiring Lorenzo Lamas and so didn't_actually_include_sharks (even CG ones, or heaven forbit ones that creatively munched unsuspecting B actors) was better than Tip Toes.

My wife tried to argue that the premise ""sounded interesting"" and that it failed on execution. No no no no no. There were two justifiable paths this could have gone down, but inexplicably chose not to -- as an afterschool special called ""Johnny's got a little secret"", or as a David Lynch movie in which John Malkovich and maybe Laura Dern should also have shown up as little people along with Gary Oldman. How embarrassing this must have been to work on. Surely Gary must have had a moment half way through when he had to slap himself and ask why he was here.

2066481,3,B000286S1U,"`Tiptoes' is a rare social commentary and comedy which takes on what may be one of the very few personal problems not yet explored in a film. As interracial and interfaith relations have been explored up the wazoo, the very premise of this movie raises a little grim. The basic plot is driven by difficulties between a normal sized couple where the man has dwarfism in his genes and is afraid to admit it to their partner until it may be too late. That is, until the woman has become pregnant. The title, then, is a double entendre on dwarfs standing on tiptoe to come closer to normal height and the manner in which normal sized people tiptoe around the subject of dwarfism, especially in conversations with `little people'.

After `Lord of the Rings' where six normal sized actors are represented as sub 4 foot tall hobbits and one dwarf in the company of normally tall characters, it was almost expected that this technique would be used in other movies, so that `little people' can be represented my major name actors. In this case, it should be almost no surprise whatsoever that the top billing given to the actor in the dwarf role goes to Gary Oldman who has made a speciality of really oddball roles, mostly as villains, and mostly with heavy makeup and costuming. This is not the kind of movie I normally look forward to seeing, but the prospect of seeing another Oldman performance decided the issue. He is certainly among my favorite hard case actors, along with Mickey Rourke, Steve Buscemi, and Harvey Keitel. In this movie, aside from his small stature, Oldman plays the role straight up. In fact, the whole movie makes no cheap jokes whatsoever over the premise and over dwarfs. The closest the movie comes to an easy laugh is when the woman's (Beckinsale) normal sized parents meet the man's (McConaughey) dwarf parents and brother (Oldman) for the first time, and the woman's mother strains to bring up a delicate subject.

This movie probably casts more dwarf actors than any since either `The Wizard of Oz' or the more recent `Legend'. And, unlike either of those two fantasy movies, this movie deals with all the mostly good and sometimes loutish side of dwarf characters. I sincerely do not understand why the dwarf actor, Peter Dinklage, playing the most important dwarf role next to Oldman does not get a credit tacked onto the end of the names of the four normal sized actors. He appears on the screen longer than Patricia Arquette, with whom he maintains a plainly sexual relation through most of the movie. The relation between Arquette and Dinklage plays as a kind of counterpoint to the relation between Beckinsale and McConaughey, almost like the comic relief provided by the amateur troupe of actors in `A MidSummer's Night Dream' play to the much more serious goings on between the young human lovers and the spirits of the forest.

Aside from Oldman's transformation into a dwarf, the movie makes almost no effort to disguise incongruous facts about the actors and their roles. The engaged couple have a Jewish wedding, while both actors are about as Irish Catholic as you can possibly imagine. Also, while Oldman and McConaughey are plotted as literally biological twins, Oldman is obviously several years older than McConaughey.

While this is not a thriller, and while you sometimes wonder whether the movie is really going anywhere, it does arrive at a surprising conclusion which is consistent with it's primary theme, where it is the man with the dwarf genes who has a problem with the dwarf child, while the normal mother accepts the child and deals with the medical problems which accompany a child growing up with dwarfism.

Movies with a social conscience tend to entertain me less than a good action, suspense, horror, or sci-fi flick, but I can see and appreciate the skill of the writer and actors in this movie, and I can enjoy another addition to the collection of unusual Gary Oldman performances. I relish the thought of Oldman's getting together to make a movie with Quentin Tarantino. Yum.

I liked this movie until the end.  I could understand when Steven reacts badly to the pregnancy and when the baby turns out as a dwarf.  But I hated that they had Carol, after Steven left her because he did not know how to deal with it all, starts a relationship with the brother.  Not because he was a dwarf but because it seems the only reason she does it is because the brother is willing to help raise the baby and act like a father figure.

At no time did I believe they were these characters.  Also, Kate Beckinsale, while talented and gorgeous, simply needs better dialogue.  She seems to be forcing the words out while ignoring any or all emotional conotation therein.  In fact, the only performance of any special note here is Matthew McConaughey.  He has a few splendid scenes in which he buries all the other actors attempting to steal the scene from him.  There are a couple of scenes where he is sincerely emotional and the other actors look like deer caught in the headlights of a Mac truck.
