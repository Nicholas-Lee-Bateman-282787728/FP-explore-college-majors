Sure, even that DVD set is not perfect, but it is better and complete.

After MGM took over his contract & paired Buster in features alongside Jimmy Durante, Buster left & went over to the poverty-row studio of Educational Films to make some low budget (but still fun) comedy shorts.  These show Buster making the best from what little he was given.",1317427200,,770,6.3238095238095235
8375020,4,B002NF1QN0,"Busters young and rather cute in these I think. For the time era it was filmed, its not too bad. Not those crackly blacked out oldies that are hard to watch. I watched these over and over for a few weeks, prefered them over some others I've gotten. Especially liked ""Mixed Magic"", it had me laughing. Im not easy at laughing.
