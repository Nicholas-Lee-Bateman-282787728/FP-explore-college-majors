8678703,4,B0041P567C,"Remember those cartoon shorts from Sesame Street?  Or School House Rocks?  This animated short film by Oregon native Noah Dorsey pays tribute to that 70's animation style but with a heartfelt and thoughtful storyline.  It's a story about brothers, family relationships, abandonment, love, and forgiveness, but told with dark humor, wit, and great care.
