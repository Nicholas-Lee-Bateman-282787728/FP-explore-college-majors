8756444,5,B01DN25308,"We bought this video and watched it before we brought our new puppy home. We had seen Jeremy do some demos in person and, though we weren't sure it would work for us, we knew we had to try it. Our puppy was placed trained within 3 weeks of being home at only 10 weeks old, she's now over a year and half and her ""place"" is her favorite spot to be. My husband did most of the training, but I think it was super beneficial that we both watched the video so that everything could be routine. The food training was the easiest way to incorporate at least a little training into every day and helped her learn to sit quickly and was easily converted for use now that she retrieves. I also found his timelines on discipline to be spot on for our dog as she aged. I recommend either taking some notes as you watch or rewatching as your puppy grows for refreshers! We constantly get positive feedback on our dog's behavior and I know it wouldn't have been possible without this video. We watched three other videos not by Jeremy that were borrowed from friends, and they did not work as well for me and I did find them easy to follow or relatable like Jeremy.",1502841600,4,1151,4.236363636363636
