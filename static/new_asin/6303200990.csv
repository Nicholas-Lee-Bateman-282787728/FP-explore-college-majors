The makers of this episode have re-invented this stereotype, indeed they have endeavored to embellish this stereotype by suggesting that Irish people are going the way of de-evolution. Ie that in four hundred years when everyone else is so civilised and sophisticated, Irish people will be living among their animals and will be either Darby O Gill parodies (like the attractive sex-mad irish lady looking for a husband) or filthy uncouth unattractive stupid drunks like the male. How the hell they ever got away with such racist garbage i will never know, imagine if a stereotype concerning Jews or homosexuals was used instead of Irish people... There would have been hell to pay. There are really only two possibilities, the first is that the makers are extremely anti-irish racist bigots. The second is that their ignorance and stupidity is of monumental proportions (in imagining Irish people were EVER like THAT). Unfortunately i am a huge Star Trek fan, and this episode as terrible it is both in it's offensive nature and the extremely low quality of the storyline does not succeed in making me cold to the series, but i have to wonder what was going through Colm Meaney's mind as that episode was being screened. Now as to which it is hate or stupidity i have to conclude it must be hate, they had an example of irishness to dispell their ignorance in Meaney.",1101772800,5,1565,4.909433962264151
7841080,4,6303200990,"A Federation diplomat once said the secret of his success was turning disadvantages into advantages, a philosophy that serves Picard well in this particular episode, which deals with two colonies established, by the Mariposa in the 22nd century.  On the one hand we have the Bringloidi, colonists who need to be evacuated because their sun has started shooting off solar flares.  The Bringloidi, who must have all come from Ireland since we are talking accents the like of which have not been heard on a starship Enterprise since Scotty was in his prime, insist on bringing their animals, along with their kit and caboodle.  It makes for a lovely time in the cargo bay, don't you know now.  On the other hand the Enterprise discovers there is a sister colony to the first, founded when the Marioposa crash-landed.  Only five colonists survived, all scientists, who turned to cloning to populate the planet.  However, there are now DNA problems and further cloning will soon be impossible.  Now Picard has TWO problems to solve . . . or DOES he?
This is something of a fun episode.  With all their animals the Bringloidi have turned the cargo bay into a pretty interesting place and they have no qualms about taking advantage of their hosts.  It is rather refreshing to see folk who are so unrepentedly people of the land in the age of warp drive, even though these odd folks have both primitive tools and advanced computers.  However, the emphasis is more on the group as a band of gypsies who have just happened to park on the Enterprise.  But unlike holodeck creations, these people just do not want to go away.  ""Up the Long Ladder"" makes up for the fact that for the most part Picard forgets he has all those annoying civilians and children running around on his ship.  The main thing is I just love those Irish accents in the 24th century.",972518400,3,1844,4.671826625386997
