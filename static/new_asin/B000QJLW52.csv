2839050,5,B000QJLW52,"This Lucia di Lammermoor, dated from 1967, is a classic performance that should be in every opera lovers collection. It documents Carlo Bergonzi and Renata Scotto in their wonderful prime. Both rip into Donizetti's score with beatiful passion. Scotto, at this point, still has some great high notes, unfortunatly the first Eb in the mad scene is pushed a little hard and tends to go out of pitch. The second Eb goes much better for her. Bergonzi was a master of belcanto and this performance will make your heart cry, especially the last scene.
I had the bootleg version of this for years, and I was expecting a little better quality out of this release. I am not sure if this is the original master, it probably is, but the pitcure is slighly grainy and some scenes seem to have a circle around the outer edge. That is really trivial considering the sound and singing are SO SO great here.
I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the ""golden age of singing"" in all of its wonderful glory!",1182124800,14,1006,4.56353591160221

8196589,5,B000QJLW52,"First, the bad news: some scenes look as if they are being filmed underwater -- at least on my screen, I get this glaucous green tinge, in the final scene for example.  Too much of the video is a bit dim.  Then the Enrico, Mario Zanasi, looks good but sounds a bit ordinary.  The sound is mono -- but the voices do come through well.  Most irritatingly, the piece plays like a series of set pieces, because the audience tends to interrupt where they shouldn't.  For example, Scotto has to take a bow in the middle (!!!) of the mad scene.  You can see her trying to maintain character, but the audience won't quit, so finally she gives up and acknowledges them.  There's about a five minute break, which totally ruins the dramatic thrust of the scene.  Likewise with Bergonzi in the Tomb scene -- he has to take a bow after ""Fra poco . .""  Also a negative is Bergonzi's acting -- it's rudimentary when others are on stage.  You can see him position himself to produce the sound he wants, even if it doesn't make dramatic sense.  When he's alone onstage, that matters less, because he isn't playing off anybody and can make his gestures seem appropriate.  So it's a disaster, right . . .?

Except that Bergonzi sings his part more beautifully than anyone else on DVD or CD for that matter.  In 1967, when this was filmed, he was at his peak (his Enzo in the Decca ""Gioconda"" belongs to the same period).  To think that this a live performance (he made two very fine studio performances of the role) makes it all the more amazing.  And Scotto is marvelous too -- the very top of the voice has its typical edge, but her performance is a masterclass in economical expressive gesture.  She's wonderfully touching in ""Soffriva nel pianto,"" for example, and the mad scene is beautifully done, except for that five minute intermission, which isn't Scotto's fault.  Other strengths?  Bartoletti's sensible pacing, and Plinio Clabassi's Raimondo -- he makes him a real character, and sings better than Colombara (on Opus Arte) and PLishka (on the Sutherland/Kraus recording).  Sutherland/Kraus might still be the best musico-dramatic experience, but don't miss Bergonzi and Scotto.",1356825600,5,2170,4.720744680851064
8196590,4,B000QJLW52,My has technology changed. The cast is excellent with the exception of Scotto's I'll-fated husband. The picture quality is poor and sound mono so we really cannot experience the true greatness of Scotto and Bergonzi. Subtitles were superb. This has been a sickness with most DVD operas....cliff note subtitles. Not here...at times you had to be a speed reader. Highly recommended though  Lucia's death scene a little laid back having recently seen newer MET versions.,1302912000,3,467,5.226666666666667
8196591,5,B000QJLW52,"I knew Renata Scotto would be awesome, and she didn't disappoint.  However, I'm relatively new to opera, so I never heard of Carlo Bergonzi.  As soon as he started singing, I knew he was one of the all time greats without looking him up.  I think he has the most beautiful male voice I have ever heard.  I also loved Plinio Clasbassi beautiful bass voice.  Although the picture is a bit fuzzy and the sound isn't as high-tech as modern recordings, it still sounds very good.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Bergonzi's Edgardo is worth the price of admission.",1283644800,5,557,4.565656565656566
8196592,5,B000QJLW52,"No wonder Renata Scotto and Carlo Bergonzi are legends!  I was hooked by their incredible voices immediately, especially Renata Scotto, whom I had not seen in a performance before.  Her range, her control, her gorgeous high notes, her pianissimo were simply wonderful.  Her duet with the flute brought the house down.

Similarly, I had not seen Carlo Bergonzi in a peformance and found his singing utterly fantastic.  Can he hold a note!  What breath control.  Amazing!

I also thoroughly enjoyed Mario Zanasi as Enrico and Plinio Clabassi as Raimondo.  I wonder why their names are not more familiar.  The very fine Japanese chorus also contributed greatly to the quality of this production.

I have yet to see a Lucia di Lammermoor that I didn't like and rated all of them five stars.  This is another winner!  Recommended!",1210636800,4,825,4.934306569343065

Japan, 1967.

OK, this is IT.  Barring the cuts, this is the LUCIA of Gaetano Donizetti. No schtick, no Carol Burnetting around. Just Donizetti and Cammarano's Romantic drama, pure and simple. Real artists, real singers. Performing it straight, as if their lives depended on it. No gimmicks. You watch this 40 year old performance, and you see and hear a kind of authority and rightness of approach that just doesn't happen often nowadays.  Here we have music. Here is all the garlic, red wine, passion and organic Italian musical DRAMA.  The action contained within the singing. It's a miracle, nothing less.

The picture is a bit grainy, the sets standard issue. Does it matter? Give me a break (NO).

We start with Bergonzi. Tenore supremo. Short, stumpy (yet handsome here), gestures of stock vintage. Yet, he creates drama through voice alone;""Vi disperda!"" cuts right to the bone. Debonair in the old-fashioned manner. Ardent, the ultimate tenor hero. Perfect. Voice, voice voice - in awesome form here.  ""Fra poco a me ricovero"" just splendid: it's met with a roaring ovation. Bergonzi and Scotto do not have the sensual interplay of Ricciarelli and Carreras - they don't make a lot of eye contact and are sometimes hilariously buried in their own ""work"" - but they are together all the way vocally and musically.

Zanasi.  ""Another"" Italian baritone of his time, extinct today. A darkly handsome man, he has a commanding presence.  He sings a solid ""Cruda, funesta smania,"" beginning with a slightly muscular overemphasis, yet it suits the piece; but the line,  upper extensions of ease, and expression is just right.

Plinio Clabassi.  A Raimondo of unusually fine caliber, with a mellow, steady, consummately produced tone - he evinces a genuine control over it, and uses it flexibly - no park and bark approach here. Moreover, he makes the character figure prominently: he really delivers a tale in his ""Dalle stanze, ove Lucia,"" setting up the mad scene fittingly.

Scotto is spectacular, nothing short of miraculous here. What may have been accepted as standard then registers as something extraordinary now.  Scotto is in marvelous voice: that brisk, tangy sound, slightly piercing on high, is bracingly clear, pure and perfectly steady throughout. She has never sounded more appealing, nor so classically Italianate in tone and manner.  Her coloratura, while not of Sutherlandian velocity, is neat, in place, and confidently deployed. Trills are not a prominent thing of disctict articulation, yet they are discerned - and importantly, uses them effectively in the line where called for. High notes pop out quite strongly. What's most important here is she does that all-important shaping and binding of lines into an expressive whole; she has a way of magically ""dropping in"" and connecting phrases, with a wide range of dynamics, and her diction is an absolute joy - no alteration of vowels or slushing over of them. She makes every word clear, and meaningful.  The line in ""Regnava nel silenzio"" is ideal, true, unfussed, yet so very sustained on a level of gripping narrative.  ""Verranno a te sull'are"" is pristinely, gorgeously sung, as is ""Soffriva nel pianto.""  This kind of cantabile singing should be taken heed by any budding Lucia today.

But what is most especially distinctive is that in each isolated number, she tells a STORY.  You see in her face, the spontaneity of her delivery of the words and expressions, how they register upon the listener as internal thoughts, given out to the audience. What's most important here, though, is that she is so NOT trying to force external gimmicks onto the characterization.  The question never forms in the mind, what kind of a character IS Lucia? A spineless wimp? Sick from the start? A mad hatter?  No, the Lucia here is one that uninformed individuals will never understand: she is a 19th century Romantic heroine, a girl in love with Edgardo. Scotto reacts in each episode as if the character were hearing the statements of the others in the story for the first time. It has a uniquely-alive spontaneity, unusually free of calculation.  I'm sick of the discussion of whether Lucia is mentally ill from the start, based on her occult meanderings in ""Regnava nel silenzio;"" if anyone knew of literature, religious superstitions and so forth of that time, these were conventional devices in Romantic melodramas. Ghosts and apparitions are commonplace.  So, then, Scotto just accepts Cammarano's text, and tells it without any manipulation or presumption.  She or we do not think Lucia mentally ill from the git-go.

Scotto's emotional honesty never falters, not once.  She is convincing in the scene with Enrico, bringing just the right amount of anguish, her reactions often touching; in ""Se tradirmi,"" you see her pleading to God most plausibly.  In the wedding scene, Scotto is riveting, and does what Mariella Devia had a hard time establishing in her La Scala 1992 video: show the abject despair and desolation of Lucia, as the hope drains out of her. Devia has the astounding vocal technique that kept her singing better longer, but she does not have, by a considerable margin, Scotto's all-abiding charisma and out-there personality.  Back to the Wedding Scene: the sextet, onto the end of the act, just sizzles and explodes with drama - those voices just pour out with thrilling abandon. Exciting stuff, this.

After all my extravagance of description, I'll have to think of ways to go further concerning the Mad Scene: it's a revelation. One of the best, hands down, I have ever seen performed.  Every American soprano and all directors should watch this. This is how it should be done. In the service of the music, no gimmicks.

Scotto is in her element. Intensely musical, letting the scene flow with astonishing naturalness. Again, she's telling a story. The audience doesn't see this, but the TV viewer does: close-ups reveal the soprano absolutely into her music/storymaking.  Scotto has the audience confidently in the palm of her hand, but not for a moment is she calculating or manipulative: it is, rather, an artist in full sureness and specific aim in what she is doing - she's fascinating to watch at every point, you can't take your eyes off her.  She's living the situation moment by moment. We get no hysterics, no forced ""mad acting"" or cheap effects (which I despise). Lucia is totally removed from reality, in her childlike state, moving around like a little ghost in her own little but all-consuming world.  Apart from a few moments of fright (the ""il fantasma"" sequence is powerful), she's deliriously happy, living out her bliss with Edgardo.  Most of all, though, finally, you get the full power and pathos of what Donizetti intended. Scotto weds the text with the music so skillfully so that you get the full effect how how beautifully they complement each other. She does not allow the music to be compromised, so she takes care to make all the actions fit in, rather than standing out, as is the won't of too many a soprano. Scotto's bravura accomplishment is a triumph, and what a fortuitous circumstance that these documents exist, and that we have privy to them.

The bows and biz in the lengthy applause after the flute with cadenza, is however, pure Scotto. She steps out of character to acknowledge the ovation. No objections at all; it is decidedly part of the show. Very much like Cossotto, oh thank thank you, oh so humble me but I deserve it.  I'm beginning to think these kinds of self-possessed artists, who don't display false modesty very well, are the lastingly memorable artists.  Infinite self-belief, a healthy dose of the imperious ego, wanting to please, absolutely certain of their merit, and a kind of inborn dementedness: it translates into a very personal charisma, which defines who they are.

Without a doubt, this is the video LUCIA of choice.  Even though it's cut, it retains and fleshes out the truest spirit of the piece.",1200182400,19,8188,5.011070110701107
8196594,4,B000QJLW52,"I agree with all of the above coments, and have nothing more to add about the glorious singing. Carlo Bergonzi has one of the most beautiful tenor voices of his or any other era. I, personally, was very disapointed in the quality of the picture. I know that that performance was recorded in Japan in the late 60's so I was expecting a clearer picture on my new HD TV. It is fantastic to see & hear a youngish Bergonzi & Scotto. The sound & singing are fantastic and this DVD is worth having for any fan of Carlo Bergonzi.",1197072000,3,521,4.22
8196595,4,B000QJLW52,"Good to see these once private tapes circulating commercially on dvd.

Dramatically Renata Scotto makes a very interesting and balanced character on stage. Neither overdone, nor boring and especially her acting in the mad scene is spot on. Her peculiar childish facial features and petite figure make her a convincing Lucia too. On the other hand I've never seen a soprano milk an applause as much as Scotto does in this performance, not only does it spoil the drama, it makes her look silly too. Vocally her performance suffers from her harsh forte notes above the staff. The middle and lower notes on the other hand are good and her smooth legato brings much to her phrasing but too often has she got to sing a high note and the result is painful. Softly, the results are much more pleasant and the mad scene has some really nice ones until we get to the louder ones.

The leading male cast however compensates for any Scotto shortcomings. Mario Zanasi appears first and his bronze, powerful Italian baritone rings splendidly. Not the most subtle singing for sure but I couldn't stop admiring the powerful core of this voice. He's very keen to show his long breath off but his milking has got no chance against Scotto's! He too is convincing as the evil brother but the voice simply overshadows all other aspects of his character. He'd be a leading recording and performing baritone today.

Edgardo is one of Bergonzi's finest roles and this live performance is a splendid proof. The scene totally changes the moment he enters and pours his first phrase. If Lucia was delighted to see him, I was thrilled to hear him, especially after her top note in Quanto rapito. On stage Bergonzi does his standard acting tricks but I found him surprisingly intense in the sextet outburst. But even his standard tricks work fine and he seemed more involved than most tenors I've seen in this role. Vocally there isn't a phrase he doesn't care for, a note that isn't beautifully sung. It's said that Maria Callas during their MET Lucias would sit behind the curtains after her mad scene and wait to listen to Bergonzi do justice to Donizetti's finale because according to her there was no tenor around who could sing it like Bergonzi. Bergonzi has said that this was one of the greatest compliments he ever received.

Raimondo's lovely duet with Lucia is sadly cut here which makes Clabassi's task pretty thankless but at least the Japanese audience appreciates the scene before Lucia's madness. Angelo Marciandi is Arturo and I fully sypmathise Lucia. You have to see this man to get my point..I burst out laughing! His singing is terrible and the only positive thing I can say is that he seems to understand what he's singing.

Bartoletti gives his singers a lot of freedom and the sound quality is good enough to enjoy the performance. Can't give it 5 stars because of Scotto's high notes but Bergonzi and Zanasi easily raise 4 stars. Everyone's got their favourite Lucia and mine is Mariella Devia who's got a lot of Scotto's good qualities plus limpid top notes. Favourite recording, her 1990 Rome performance in the original keys with all the ornaments and top notes (F).",1184025600,20,3165,4.757741347905283
8196596,5,B000QJLW52,"The two reviews posted as of this writing are on the mark with their five-star ratings.  Scotto's Lucia and Bergonzi's Edgardo present a level of bel canto singing that would be almost impossible to surpass in any era.  This televised Tokyo performance has been available on pirate VHS and DVD for a long time.  The present VAI commercial issue provides a better video image -- you can even see the scenery, which is not particularly important but makes it clear that this release is taken from a different source than the pirate version, perhaps the original source.  It also replaces the Japanese subtitles with a choice of English and other languages, edits out the spoken Japanese plot summaries between acts, and restores the truncated curtain calls after the Ravenswood Tombs scene which closes the opera with two great arias by Edgardo.  This restoration reveals that Carlo Bergonzi's performance of this scene was rewarded with six and a half minutes of applause in the course of no fewer than eleven curtain calls -- in four of these calls Bergonzi is joined by Plinio Clabassi (Raimondo) and Bruno Bartoletti (conductor); in one he is joined only by Bartoletti; and the remaining six calls are Bergonzi's alone, the last one in front of the main curtain.  If you want to see why the audience was so enraptured with Bergonzi's performance, this DVD will show you.  Scotto also provides a beautiful performance which was also very well received.  Any one of three numbers may increase your heartbeat, bring tears to your eyes, and/or excite your soul, and would alone justify the purchase of this DVD: the aforementioned Ravenwoods scene; Lucia's mad scene; and the Lucia-Edgardo duet in the Lammermoor castle fountain scene.  Thank you, VAI.  I hope it will not be long before you give us a similar restoration of the performance of Verdi's Un Ballo in Maschera from the same ""Lirica Italiana"" forces -- also a 1967 telecast from Tokyo, in which Bergonzi's Riccardo is joined by Antonietta Stella's Amelia.  Who knows what else may be revealed by that restoration, but the performance also finds Bergonzi in magnificent voice in one of his best roles.  While we wait, we still have our cherished pirates of that performance (again with Japanese subtitles only), but it would be wonderful to have a restoration like the present issue if VAI has access to the NHK or other superior sources.",1183766400,44,2397,4.920595533498759
8196597,5,B000QJLW52,"For those that are not familiar with Renata Scotto in her prime, this DVD should be a revelation.  Not only is the voice beautiful but her technique is brilliant.  The mad scene is a highlight.  If she is not quite as showy with pyrotechnics as Sutherland and Sills, she is still spectacular.  The pathos and word pointing she brings to every scene is unique. It confirms why many see her as the rightful successor to Maria Callas. Her Edgardo is Carlo Bergonzi, another paragon of operatic style, who matches her note for note with elegance and beauty of tone.  The charisma of Scotto is lacking in Bergonzi, but is more than made up for in his total stylistic commitment.  The two of them have made several important recordings together and the matching of these great voices is always a treat.  Mario Zanasi was one of the best baritones of the '60s.  Although he never achieved true stardom, his contribution here is a major plus.  Scotto did record Lucia very early in her career with Di Stefano and Bastianni, but this was before her vast stage experience.  Every lover of bel canto will want this DVD even if you already own Sutherland's, Moffo's, etc.",1182470400,29,1159,4.665024630541872
