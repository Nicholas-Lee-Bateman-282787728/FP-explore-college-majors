8342921,5,B001CU99NG,Virginia has a Personal Protection Agent certification and this video offers an insight and a good introduction into what good training should be like for executive protection.  I know I have had executive protection for a number of years now and this video offers a good starting point for those thinking about doing this as a career or for those thinking of taking a course like this to protect themselves.  It is a good video and ITC did a great job challenging the students.  I think the fact that only 12 of the 18 students qualified at the end is a good indication of how disciplined and rigorous this ITC training likely is.,1395273600,,631,4.566371681415929

8342923,4,B001CU99NG,"I bought this DVD partly on the recommendation of a Facebook friend and partly out of curiosity about what type of training ITC offered. Having attended Executive Protection training myself and having seen other documentaries of this type, I was hoping to get some details on the curriculum of that particular school.

Firstly, for anyone purchasing this thinking they're going to get a real ""insiders"" view into typical training... you're only going to see around 30% of what's involved in the job and the training. They're covering a 7-day course with less than 2 hours of footage. You're seeing the ""highlights"". If you're buying a video like this in the belief that you'll learn how to train to be a bodyguard... you won't. If you're curious about some of what the typical training school will have you doing, you'll see about 30%. Watch the first hour of The Bodyguard with Kevin Costner and you'll get as good a look at what's involved in actually doing the work... possibly better if you're paying attention.

For entertainment purposes I think it's worth the money. The stuff you see them doing is comparable to most other EP training facilities, though each one has it's one particular style and methodology. The quality of the DVD is decent, though I noticed a few syncing issue with the audio. (From VHS to DVD.) Bu they... it's not an expensive item either.

Overall, I'd say that it's good effort for what it represents which is a snapshot of EP training. I don't regret the purchase.",1303171200,,1497,4.794573643410852
