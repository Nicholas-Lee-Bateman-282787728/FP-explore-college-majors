This movie is great...BUT!If you saw this movie in American theatre and hated it for its plot hole but did not see the Hong Kong version on DVD. Then people you got suckered. The movie you saw in U.S theatre was cut down to 102 mins from its original 122 min version. So I don't know about you but if you cut out that much film out of the original it's no wonder why you hate the film. And this film is in no way like Hero or House Of Flying Daggers nor was it intended to be so why is everyone saying that the film makers are trying to copy those movies. This movie is also been accused to trying to copy The Matrix for using wire works. Wire works has been around since the 60's way before the Matrix and it was basicaly created by the Asians. So if anything The Matrix copied them. And the Graphics are considered cheesy and not realistic HELLO!! this is a fantasy film so there world is not supposed to look realistic. And people think the graphics in movies like MIRROR MASK are cool but the graphics in this is way better than that one. You may take this as one mans ranting but I bet most people around here who claim they like asian movie only like Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon, Hero, House of Flying Daggers. But they never made an effort to see any other asian films that big time studios in america don't import here to show. If that is the case then you should not consider yourselves as fans. Don't rent the U.S release cause your only gonna piss yourself off get the imported version. But don't get the one that has the cover where Jang Dong-Gun Is hugging Cecilia Cheung that one cut 8 to 10 mins of the film get the 2-disc version.",1154563200,,1683,4.213622291021672
7900370,5,7883636286,"This movie is a fantasy epic tale. Many people will give this bad reviews becuase it is not realistic. Its a fantasy. Its not supposed to be. This movie is mindblowing. The story is beautiful. Being a Jang dung-gun fan, i bought this and this turned out to be one of the best buys i have done. The cast is perfect. This is one of the highest budget movies from korea, and it shows. I like how different the characters are and how they are portrayed in this world. If you like foreign movies, or fantasy epics, this is the best out there.",1146873600,,537,4.223300970873787
7900371,1,7883636286,"As some reviewers at the Berlin festival put it: it's a waste of money, fortunately not of talent, as there is none to be found... The picture gets clearer when you realise that the most expensive picture mainland China has over put out is still only around 35 Mil. Dollars, meaning that all of the technical stuff, the cgi and mattes and whatever is around needed to be bought at cheap suppliers in God knows where - or produced in-house, in China. As with most more sophisticated technological ventures, the result becomes apparent: It claims to be basically the same as the 'real' stuff (the Lord of the Rings or Matrix stuff), but you see immediately that all of it is nothing but the plastic variety of the original. Special effects is nothing you can just copy, you have to know it - and the places where people know are far away from Beijing, and much more expensive, too.

Even more expensive are good scripts, because you cannot just go out and buy them, even if you had unlimited amounts of money. Shame is that when you try to run for Oscar material ""in the style of...."" (Tiger Dragon, in particular), you are stuck to a certain kind of narrative, even if you don't know what story to tell. So WuJi is the result of a gigantic effort to shove offical Chinese cinema on a global plattform (including forcing the film on all Chinese screens for a while), with the result of Ang Lee running for Oscars with his little love story (banned from the mainland China screens) and Chen KaiGe defintitely not running for anything, maybe away from the critiques. Sounds fair enogh.",1145923200,,1581,4.566901408450704
7900372,4,7883636286,"I ordered this DVD after seeing the trailer online.  I was captured by the incredible images.  If you want a great plot, you may want to look elsewhere.  If you prefer just sitting back and watching a movie filled with imagination and beauty, you will love this one.",1145577600,2,266,4.5
7900373,5,7883636286,All I got to say is that it's very entertaining and very interesting. The action scenes were great... reminds me of Drangon Ball Z...The story is pretty interesting and it does make sense...Very great movie...great addition to your dvd collection...very worth buying!,1140739200,,267,5.380952380952381
7900374,5,7883636286,"The Promise brings to the screen the story of a slave who kills the king of the land and rescues a princess only to fall in love with her.  If that wasn't a difficult predicament, the realm's most popular general, who happens to be his master, also has his eyes set on the princess.  Little do both of them know that the princess is cursed by the gods...

The film combines fantasy, romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!

Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.

The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.

Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.

Needless to say, the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.

The setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all wonderful!

Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, let alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.

Strongly recommended along with Seven Swords, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The House of Flying Daggers, and Hero, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.",1139875200,,1466,4.963114754098361
7900375,3,7883636286,Fantasy action magic and martial arts are the ingredients of the charming Chinese 121 minutes fairy tail directed by Chan. Like all fairy tails includes a romantic love story. The amazing photography of the movie supports perfectly the really fast action. The Promise is a very good and interesting work and becomes a real promise of what we will see in the near future coming out from the Chinese studios. I will give it only three stars because I believe that the scenario is not that strong as it could be. In the fantasy world everything is allowed.,1139875200,3,553,4.653061224489796
7900376,1,7883636286,"Usually I like chinese fairy-tale-they-fly-and-stop-daggers-with-their-teeth(whatever) movies, but this one was TOO much. I watched it with bunch of friends and we started dying laughing half way thru. By the end of the movie it was a smart-ass-remark contest on some of the stuff in the movie (swiss-army-fan being one of the most hilarious). Man it was just TOO much. Story makes no sense at all, and use of computer animation was TOO obvious not to add to ridiculousness of the overall experience.",1139875200,,500,5.109756097560975
