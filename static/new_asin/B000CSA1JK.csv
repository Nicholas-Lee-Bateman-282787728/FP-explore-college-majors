2472748,5,B000CSA1JK,"A little disorienting at first, this movie is such a rich tapestry with several multidimensional characters that one can't be certain where it's taking us.  The America never seen in American films (except by Haskell Wexler) defines post-9/11 bewilderment within the context of poverty, legitimate faith, and paranoia.  A second viewing--during the director's commentary--reveals that (Leonard Maltin's review to the contrary) the narrative structure is tight.

The central male character conjures up the anomie of the leads in THE PARALLAX VIEW, TAXI DRIVER, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.  The Christian heroine is a good and decent young woman, played with freshness and sincerity and not one whiff of cynicism. The black minister, performed by one of THE WIRE's wittier regulars, offers a more true-to-life representation of black Americans' core values than almost ever reaches American TV or movie screens, and without treacle or bombastics.  One regrets the absence of close-ups in the cameo by Gloria (TITANIC, INVISIBLE MAN) Stuart, but her scene is delightful.

In his commentary, Wenders repeatedly extols the use of DVD cameras that allowed him to complete 60 or 70 set-ups a day in a 16-day shoot.  The cinematography (all hand-held) is astonishingly beautiful.  And Wenders rightly praises his set designer who had only $20,000 to work with and yet came in under budget!

Doubtless, the German director's background affords him the distance with which to comment so cogently on America a couple of months after Bush declared the invasion of Iraq a success.  With its documentary feel and non-mainstream perspective, LAND OF PLENTY will increase in value over the years, as a photo album of conditions and attitudes we can only hope will continue to heal.",1178928000,10,1763,5.264285714285714
2472749,4,B000CSA1JK,"There's a lot to be said for a film that makes profound statements about the 9/11 attacks and its effects on Vietnam vets. Most of us were probably too shocked inside our own little bubble to realize the impact these men felt when exploding planes collapsed the twin towers. But director Wim Wenders (DON'T COME KNOCKING) pulls it off thanks to a fairly good script and even better acting by lead actors John Diehl and Michelle Williams.

Never having seen Diehl in a leading role, this movie shows he's got some serious chops and can act with the best Hollywood has to offer. Equally Michelle Williams pulls off a stunningly excellent performance as the worldly but loving niece who helps Diehl discover himself all over again.

The story ...

Paul (John Diehl) is a Vietnam vet living in Los Angeles. He lives in a fantasy world all his own, believing that he's helping with national security by tracking suspicious looking people with his surveillance tricked-out van. He operates a camera that comes out of the van's sunroof and records activity around town.

Michelle (Michelle Williams, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) is returning from Tel Aviv after years away from the States. Her mother passed away and she's trying to hook up with her last surviving relative in America: Paul. Working at a mission for the poor, she befriends many of its patrons and meets up with a withdrawn Arab-looking gentleman named Hassan (Shaun Taub, CRASH) who also happens to be one of Paul's prime suspects.

Paul witnesses Hassan hauling boxes of borax and quickly learns that it is an ingredient for certain bomb materials. On high alert, Paul records everything Hassan does. This brings him closer to his niece, Michelle. But Hassan lives on the street and is eventually shot to death right in front of Paul, making him believe that someone knocked him off for sinister reasons.

Michelle is beset with grief about Hassan's death and searches for one of his family members. Eventually finding one near Death Valley, she convinces Paul to drive her and the body to Hassan's brother for burial. Paul agrees in the hopes of gaining more information about who Hassan was and what he was up to.

As the nexus between Paul's old Vietnam life and the new one that awaits him with Michelle begins to culminate, we see him battling bad dreams of his time in Southeast Asia but being aided and comforted by Michelle and, to his surprise, by Hassan's death and Hassan's brother.

We quickly learn that Paul went down a bad trail after the 9/11 attacks, his mind sparking up old memories in order to protect itself. He lives in his van, which is his life-connection to the world now. But that will change once Michelle teaches him how to trust again.

The film is touching if sometimes a bit heavy-handed in the dialogue department. We're sometimes forcibly given rather trite information about the homeless and war, but this is easily overlooked thanks to the able acting of its two main characters.",1176336000,16,2967,4.81335952848723
2472750,4,B000CSA1JK,"LAND OF PLENTY is nowhere near as powerful a title for this brilliant Wim Wenders film as the original working title, ANGST AND ALIENATION IN AMERICA.  This is another Wim Wenders wonder of filmmaking, a quiet little powerhouse of a movie that should be required viewing for all of us.  Wenders wrote this moving piece with assistance from Scott Derrickson and Michael Meredith and directs a sterling cast in an exploration of the American psyche post 9/11, and few writer/directors could have keener insight into the state of mind of a country at odds with itself and the rest of the world.

Lana (Michelle Williams) is flying back to the US after a two-year stay on the West Bank. She is the daughter of missionaries, having lived her life in Africa and other missionary fields and she is flying home after her mother's death to deliver a letter to her uncle Paul (John Diehl), a damaged Vietnam vet who has cut himself off from his family and the rest of life and in response to 9/11, his mind being obsessed with tracking Sleeper Cells to destroy terrorists in his own homemade surveillance van.  Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Lana is met by Henry (Wendell Pierce) who is a pastor who runs a mission for the homeless of Los Angeles and provides Lana with a bleak room and a job in the kitchen of the mission.  Lana is full of praise for God for all things, the optimistic evangelical girl who fails to recognize evil.  One member of the mission bunkhouse is a Pakistani Hassan (Shaun Toub) whose garments and fixation on boxes of Borax alerts Paul to his possible involvement as a terrorist.

Lana contacts Paul, desires to connect with him, but Paul is aloof, obsessed with his 'mission' to ferret out terrorists.  When Hassan is the victim of a drive-by shooting Lana is devastated at the loss of a human being while Paul is convinced Hassan was hit by a larger organization.  Paul with his colleague Jimmy (Richard Edson) discover Hassan has a brother who lives in Trona (outside of Death Valley).  Together Lana and Paul transport the corpse of Hassan to his brother Youssef (Bernard White) who lives in a hut in Trona: Lana is committed to doing the right thing, Paul sees an entry into more evidence for evil to quash.  While Lana is warmly entertained by Youssef, Paul investigates the town and finds that the Borax boxes of Hassan's business were innocent means of washing carpets imported from Pakistan.  The coming together of Youssef, Lana, and Paul finally achieves meaning when Paul reads the letter from his sister, Lana's mother, who  somehow manages to erase all lines of prejudice, bigotry, religious differences, misunderstanding - finally giving breathing room to the damaged souls of the brotherhood of man the three represent.

Wenders manages to bathe his story in the light of reality yet maintain an unprejudiced stance in moving his characters through their paths of revelation. The camera wanders a bit, the music blends perhaps too heavily, and the pieces of the puzzle don't always  fit together - much like life doesn't always fall into place the way we expect.  But there is much to learn from Wenders' wisdom and with the aid of perfect performances from Michelle Williams, John Diehl, and Wendell Pierce he has created an indelible work.  A fine film for us all to ponder.  Grady Harp, November 06",1164067200,2,3333,4.7669565217391305
2472751,4,B000CSA1JK,"Wim Wenders has long had a love affair with America.  He is particularly drawn to desolate places in the west and too enamored (imo) with American pop music. I'll get the flaws off my chest right away:  too much pop music, or just over-musicked, and this is my major pet peeve in movies generally.  Silence can often accomplish so much more.  Second flaw is that it just skirts sentimentality.

John Diehl and Michelle Williams were absolutelty wonderful.  Diehl is a dead-ringer for John Sayles but I got used to it. He is a 55-ish Vietnam vet who was exposed to Agent Orange and he is still suffering from PTSD.  He is obsessed with the threat of more terrorism and he is so off-the-wall sometimes it is funny but he has no notion of how he must seem to others and he has little humor inside him.  He is a patriot to his bones and drives around in his home-made detection and surveillance van aided by his somewhat goofy sidekick Richard Edson (who I like so much and am pleased he is in the movie).

Diehl is on the lookout for anything odd or untoward that might in any realm of rational thought possibly be a threat to America.  He notices an Arab carrying boxes of Borax and he is hot on a trail that he thinks will lead him to a terrorist cell.

Enter his niece, Michelle Williams, who has just returned to the US after living in Israel and being involved with both Israelis and Palestinians.  She has lived most of her life in Africa with her missionary parents. Diehl is her only living relative and she searches and finds him. This is the first time I have seen a deeply Christian person depicted in film who is credible and believable and doesn't make me want to puke (exceptions that come to mind are Susan Sarandon in Dead Man Walking and Karl Malden in On the Waterfront).  She has a radiance that stops a few degrees short of boring and trite--so she nails the role and is very touching.

The Arab man is killed in a drive-by shooting (or was it? was it something more sinister?) and Michelle and her uncle bring the man's body to his only relative who Michelle has traced.  Michelle and her uncle have totally different agendas and the resolution is very satisfying.

I didn't watch the movie with Wenders' voice-over commentary but I did watch The Making Of and Wenders has insightful and worthy things to say about America, its position in the world in the wake of 9/11 and what he was hoping to accomplish in this movie.  Really liked it a lot despite its flaws.",1160697600,9,2481,4.441501103752759
2472752,5,B000CSA1JK,"There are so few films which deal with how Americans are dealing with the aftermath of the 9/11 terroist attacks and the fear and paranoia that follow. i didn't find it unrealistic, I think these characters were very believable. I think there are many people like Paul who felt like the government wasn't doing enough to protect its citizens and took on a guardian angel approach. There are other people like Lana who have a different perspective on it, maybe due to her travels and living abroad as an expat which helps her see things from a different perspective, but she is still deeply affected. I think this movie helps us see these two perspectives and therefore helps us deal with our personal grief and feelings about the terrorist attack. It is so important that Wenders has put the issue of 9/11 which was so publicised and hyped in the context of the homeless problem which is so completely ignored. This film is simple, but insightful.",1154304000,2,947,4.710843373493976
2472753,5,B000CSA1JK,"this movie questions about the u.s. politics.

an egocentiric way of perception causes paranoid behaviours. standing on this concept, wenders re-paints a brief picture of u.s. society in a small scale! and i believe, he is very upset about what's going on!

you had to forget about hollywood clichs; timing, action, dialogs and etc...(but as a Wenders movie, it is full of many clichs) if you are bored. it's pity that, this moive tells about this schizoid situation.

also you should check the soundtrack.",1151884800,,506,5.0
2472754,1,B000CSA1JK,"The very definition of corny. An unbelievably paranoid Vietnam vet meets his unbelievably wholesome Christian neice and they witness a drive-by shooting of a Pakistani man.

One wants to contact his family, one wants to paint him as a terrorist. Somehow, his body is released into their care and they drive across California to a trailer park and dump him in a morgue before arranging his burial.

Neice and uncle somehow then ""find each other"" in a corny, dreamy, post-9-11, fluttering flags version of patriotism.

It's not about the poor innocent victim of racial profiling at all. It's all about a sugary kind of patriotism that ends up ignoring the victim entirely.

Don't bother with it. (My DVD arrived from the vender rolling around in a squashed case.)",1148083200,3,761,4.921875

8101719,5,B000CSA1JK,"The Amazing Michelle Williams and Highly Underrated John Diehl bring us a story which is both story-driven and character-driven. In this era of the Veteran and the Mid-Eastern terror threat, these two Oscar worthy actors accomplish what the great Russian theater actor / director (and inspiration for what later became known in America as ""Method"" acting) described as ""Illuminating The Life Of The Human Spirit.""

This film is both a journey into the terrifying aspects of a veteran suffering from PTSD who believes the U.S.A. is under imminent threat of a terrorist takeover, and his ""cure"" by a loving niece who he barely knows, who has sought him out as a fulfillment of a promise to her mother, his sister.

At times funny, at times tragic. This movie will move you.",1463097600,2,771,4.877862595419847
8101720,4,B000CSA1JK,"Wenders never disappoints.  His films tend to be quirky with truly great acting, always leading to something unexpected.  This film is no exception, but it starts rather slow.

I will describe some of the plot, but try to avoid spoilers.  A young lady, who is absolutely adorable and full of good intentions, moves back to the US after spending her childhood as a missionary overseas.  Her mother has recently died, so her only relation is a missing uncle whom she wishes to seek out.  Though she appears naive, she is quite tough and will not be deterred in her purpose, both in the homeless shelter where she works, but also in her search.  The uncle, it turns out, doesn't exactly want to be found, involved as he is in a personal post-9/11 ""mission"" to sniff out terrorists.  He appears to be a ludicrous paranoid with his para-military gear and suspicious of anyone who seems middle eastern or Muslim - he will pursue any lead, fervently believing he will thwart the next 9/11 and utterly humorless.  They make for an unlikely pair, but set out together to return a body to a next of kin for a burial.  What they discover actually brings them together in a very moving way, also exposing where each is coming from and helping them to heal.  It is really beautiful and believable.

According to the extras, this is Wenders' first overtly political film.  It expresses his outrage at what W's America was becoming post-9/11.  I think it only partially succeeds in getting the audience to question their assumptions, but it is an interesting development from one of the most original filmmakers of his generation.  Recommended.",1445040000,,1629,4.767857142857143

8101722,3,B000CSA1JK,"The acting is truly wonderful in ""Land of Plenty,"" but the ending is sappy and awful, ruining what could have been a timeless film.  And, as usual, Wim Wenders has a heavy hand inserting ill-suited alternative/pop songs into the movie to fill out a soundtrack album.  The title song is particularly cruddy.  I enjoyed the film nevertheless, and Michelle Williams is intriguingly adorable and eminently watchable as always.",1375142400,,422,5.176470588235294
8101723,4,B000CSA1JK,"A long time fan of other Wenders' films, it took me a while to warm to this one. There seemed something heavy-handed in the angellic girl serving soup at the shelter. And the mystery of her uncle Paul did not grab me.  But subtelty emerged and the movie drew a rich picture of post 9/11 America and the characters who inhabit it. Wim Wenders passes a humane magnifying glass across the US landscape. And his choice of music is cool as ever.",1343779200,,440,4.365853658536586
8101724,4,B000CSA1JK,"In order to understand entirely the profound devotion of Wim Wenders for North America, we have to make a backward glance respect four remarkable films that would seem to conform a huge poetic canvas about it. Alice in the cities from the middle seventies, Paris Texas (making us aware about the ontological loneliness of the human being), The end of the violence, Million dollars hotel and finally this superb rendition respect the fatidical day 9/11.

Paul is a troubled Vietnam vet (whose resemblance with De Niro is very narrow), worried and extremely convinced another terrorist strike is aboiut to come in L.A.ay any moment.

On the other hand we have his niece is an idealistic woman trying to contribute to aid the homeless people in the middle of that apocalyptical environment of L.A. low depths.

The cryptic shooting of a homeless of Middle Eastern descent will rejoin them through an uneven web of events related with the search of his brother to give the mortal body of Assam.

The last fifteen minutes we will witness the thoughtful reflections of self redemption, mournful nostalgia and poignant anguish in memory of the victims.

A poetic film that deserves to be watched. Despite its slow-paced narrative pulse, the film will catch your attention.

8101725,3,B000CSA1JK,"I love Michelle Williams, she did a superb job, as most of her work. However, I experienced some setback when purchasing, there were confusions with the vendor/s regarding my order, okmovie, and I am still fearful that I could, or maybe charged twice for the item. However, it did arrive promptly and the condition noted. I'm keeping my finger crossed that I am not being charged twice, as the outcome still premature.",1286496000,,418,4.819444444444445
8101726,2,B000CSA1JK,"I agree with Mr. Barton's review in finding this movie established upon simply too many overly raw cliches in its heavyhanded treatment of the subject matter. As well, I am of this opinion despite more liberal political leanings.

It's a shame, too, because Wenders is normally so subtle in his films, which I otherwise appreciate. An impressive performance from Michelle Williams manages to be essentially wasted in the process.",1248998400,,429,5.217391304347826
8101727,1,B000CSA1JK,"First, I enjoyed Wings of Desire back when I was 16.  Buena Vista Social Club was, imo, an excellent documentary.  I'm a huge fan of Eels and (previously at least) give carte-blanche to Mark Everett in his choice of artistic partners.  I respect (though less-so now) Wenders place in Cinema's history.

Second, I'm a former NYC resident (15 years, worked in Tower 1 during the attacks), vote democratic/independent - definitely don't hail from the conservative camp.

Finally, this is one of only a handful (I think three others) films I could not finish out of extreme distaste and dislike for it, despite a fairly great cast including Richard Edson.  It's possible that something extraordinary happens past the thrity minute mark but I can't imagine wishing to trade the thirty minutes I wasted for anything, even if Citizen Kane finished out the remainder.

The movie smacks of aloof elitism like little else.  According to Wenders, Homeless shelters are almost exclusively populated (even in LA) by African-Americans - whose only other place seems to be to manage the shelter.  The characters are little more than card-board cutouts to emphasize Mr. Wenders ridiculously immateur attitude that America has become a paranoid, idiotic morass of rich/poor conflict and anti-arab hatred.

To be sure, 2004 (the year the picture was released) saw one of our lowest points in History, re-electing a chimpanzee to the highest elected office in the free-world.  Nonetheless, that should not overshadow the overwhelming number of rational thinkers that fought against both the GOP convention (NYC protested it in record numbers) and the election of monkey-boy.

Wenders does a disservice both to himself and humanity.  Nothing, in my less-than-humble opinion, has so mischaracterized this country or humans in general than this film since Whity, Fassbinders supposed expose of the American West.

Wenders should lose his right to shoot film after this one - there are a lot of talented, intelligent people with ideas to express.  I am at a loss to explain why he felt specifically inured to commit this narrative to anything other than his ""potential ideas"" notebook - we'd all be the better if he'd let it die there.",1212969600,,2212,5.1225626740947074
