7598831,4,B01ACSKAR2,Thought provoking and a movie worth pondering about after watching it.,1461801600,,70,5.454545454545454
7598832,1,B01ACSKAR2,I would not have given this movie a 4 and a half star rating. It was very slow and dragging.,1461628800,,92,3.65
7598833,2,B01ACSKAR2,"I love these types of movies, right up my alley But I was left feeling a bit empty.  Like I almost wanted to skip forward because some scenes were so predictable and drawn out. I don't know maybe it's just me but I was really not impressed by this film.",1461542400,,253,4.06
7598834,3,B01ACSKAR2,"Not bad, but not great. Another one of those visually opulent and ravishing films with not a whole lot of narrative oomph to go along with the eye candy. They chose three of 50 Italian fairytales from a 16th century collection and sort of interwove them, or maybe interspersed is a better term. One's about magical twins, one's about a giant flee with a beauty-and-beast theme attached, and one's about a rivalry between two spinster sisters. The focus shifts without a lot of logic from one to the next, and each is told so languidly, with so much lingering on the lavish sets and costumes, that the whole thing begins to feel interminable. There are a lot of moments I'm glad I saw, but they didn't add up to a satisfying whole. I kept thinking about Fellini, and about Pasolini's Decameron and Canterbury Tales, obvious precursors, and wondering what they might have accomplished with the giant budget Matteo Garrone (who made the much better Gomorrah) obviously had to play with here.",1461542400,4,988,4.783625730994152
7598835,4,B01ACSKAR2,"This is a beautifully made film. It won't appeal to those used to a more Disneyesque way of depicting fairytales, however, it is closer to the original, dark and frightening fairytales before they become homogenized for mass comsumption. The stories held my interest all the way through, which is rather in today's filmmaking.",1461542400,2,326,5.169811320754717
7598836,4,B01ACSKAR2,"This is an adult tale of three storybook kingdoms which include magic, witchcraft and sorcery. The first tale involves Salma Hayek as a queen in an odd version of ""The Prince and the Pauper."" The second kingdom involves a princess who desperately wants to leave the castle and explore the outside world as her father holds an odd contest for her hand. The third involves a lustful king tricked into spending the night with an old woman.

The three tales swap back and forth in case you get bored. The cinematography was grand and better than the plots, whose theme appears to be: Be careful what you wish for and something to do with birth and death. The sorcerer was going to explain it, but Salma Hayek wanted the Cliff Notes version.

7598837,2,B01ACSKAR2,While visually stunning with obvious production value this film fails to come together to form a cohesive or satisfying ending. Unfortunate. Such potential.,1525564800,,156,5.826086956521739
7598838,3,B01ACSKAR2,"Nice scenery, nice costumes, diverse and multi-talented cast.

I dearly wished that I liked this endeavor more. The intent stated was a fairy tale mash up and perhaps it was but all of tales I think I've never been privileged to read. Also most of these tales seemed to drag on the slow side. Also most seemed to have little moral to the story.

A quick warning to the prudish there is a little vulgar language, blood, nudity and sex.

I watched it once over the course of 2 and a half weeks and I don't think I would recommend it highly to my friends.

If it weren't for Salma Hayek and the nice production values this would rate far lower for me.",1525132800,,648,4.2439024390243905
7598839,3,B01ACSKAR2,"The costumes are great! Unfortunately, queen Salma Hayek had zero chemistry with any other character, including the king and prince. John C Reilly came off as too meek to portray a believably heroic king, but part of that could have been due his inability to play off Hayek. The first 25 minutes of this movie which focuses on Hayek is rough and drags in places. Toby Jones is brilliant with the flea. Vincent Cassel does well in his role as a lecherous king, and the rest of the cast does well with their roles as well.

Continuity is lacking. Example- The bloody raw heart eating scene (the most well known scene of the movie) immediately follows a scene and subplot where they cook the heart. Oops!",1524873600,,701,4.563492063492063

7598842,4,B01ACSKAR2,"I really liked this, definitely not for kids. The only thing I hated was every tale was left as a cliffhanger, no true ending.",1523836800,,126,4.291666666666667
7598843,5,B01ACSKAR2,"I am writing this review because I almost made the mistake of not seeing this movie due to the number of bad/ambivalent reviews.

This movie deserves 5 stars through and through. I think one of the reasons it has so many negative reviews on amazon is because it is not presented here as an anthology film (a collection of short stories), but that is definitely what it is and what it was intended to be (For example, it is stated to be an anthology on Netflix, where it has much better reviews).

If you go into this expecting the three stories to tie together somehow, you will be very disappointed, but if you are a fan of anthology films and short stories, this is among the best I have ever seen, if not the best.

This has been stated before, but if you go into this expecting a series of Disney style fairy tales, you will be very disappointed. However, if you are more a fan of original fairy/folktales as opposed to their modern retellings, the kind that are often somewhat surreal and strange, with tragic twists of fate, and magic that is truly mysterious and rare, you will be completely in love.",1523491200,2,1107,4.443349753694581

7598869,3,B01ACSKAR2,"Visually, the movie is stunning.  The cast is enchanting, the costumes are beautiful and the musical score is very well done.  I probably spent half the movie simply staring at the costumes; even the minor extras are exquisitely garbed, and it makes for a very appealing fantasy setting.  The individual stories in the film are also rather intriguing, if you enjoy fairy tales in the traditional, morbid sense.  As the plot summary and trailer for the film will warn, do not expect a Disney sort of perfect ending.  My only problem with the movie, and it was a big enough one that it kept me from truly enjoying it, was that it seems to leave a lot of loose ends.  To prevent giving too many spoilers, I won't cite the specifics, but two of the three main story lines are left with a bit of a cliffhanger as to what exactly is going to happen to their characters.  I would have enjoyed the film much more if it had given even a single line or scene to showing how the story ends.",1499212800,7,979,4.346153846153846
7598870,4,B01ACSKAR2,If you enjoy dark fantasy you might like this. Definately not a movie to watch with children present. Just don't expect a happy ending. It's definately creative and well acted and the scenery and wardrobe are superb - not a cheap film.  It's sort of cross between Pan's Labyrinthe and a Grimm Fairytale. I found it incredibly interesting.,1499040000,3,338,4.827586206896552

7598887,4,B01ACSKAR2,"How to judge it...
This is not a standard film; i.e., it doesn't really conform to the ""beginning-middle-end"" format to the degree the average American film follows this process. Yes, it does obviously start and end, but what I felt was relevant in this film was the journey it took to get from A to Z. It is an uncomfortable film, with extraordinary situations that certainly highlight the human condition rather well, if darkly, or more cynically. There were some points of light, but overall, it is a sad depiction of humanity. The artistry of the film was pure quality, along with the cinematography and costume designs. The acting was superb. Why four stars? The conclusion of the film was a bit... sudden for my taste.

Overall, this movie is not for the feign of heart (quite disturbing) and certainly not a film for children. Yet I do recommend it if you want to be surprised by a story that doesn't beat to death the same tired norms.",1489276800,,943,4.613095238095238

7598889,5,B01ACSKAR2,"This film restores fairy tales to their proper tone, which is to say, something that Disney hasn't yet ruined.  Anyone who has read the genuine ""Grimm's Fairy Tales"" will appreciate the darkness and realism of this movie.  Poor Snow White, in the Disney version, she dances away like a simple little idiot - the end differs slightly in Grimm's: ""just then, a pair of red-hot iron shoes were brought in...and these [the Old Queen] was forced to put on and to dance in them till she fell down dead"".  What would you do with a vicious stepmother who wanted to eat your heart?  Alas, people like to paint life in pastels and are won't to admit that many of humanity's basest instincts are alive and well - and fascinating.  This film shows the tragedy of intentions good and ill.  With colorful characters, deft acting and beautiful photography, our weaknesses and strengths are shown in parables that impact each other.  Not a film for the faint of heart or the hardened realist.  Watch, listen, tremble and sigh that these fables are on the screen and not a reality.  Or...?",1488758400,5,1072,4.659574468085107
7598890,3,B01ACSKAR2,"Just right if you are interested in seeing something different, but be prepared to have more breadcrumbs than an actual path.

7598912,2,B01ACSKAR2,"This is the worst rating I have given a film all year but it comes with good justification.  The film comes in the style of a fairy tale so we do not have characters that have any real depth.  But I have seen loads of fairy tale style films where the opposite is true.  Often there is not enough connectie dialog for us to follow the story.  It moves slowly.  Some of the plot devices are frankly absurd.  (A woman gets thrown out of a high window, has her clothing catch in a tree saving her life but then out of nowhere a witch appears and casts a spell which turns her into a beautiful young girl.  No connections in this sequence at all.)
  Most of the characters are personally so nasty, weak, weird or vile that we don't much care what happens to them.  Selma Hayek as a queen totally ignores the dead body of her husband who died heroically trying to please her.  After that I didn't much care what happened to her or her plans.  A whole sup plot with a magic baby has no internal to the tale logic, it just happens with no explanation.",1482278400,2,1043,4.185929648241206

7598921,3,B01ACSKAR2,"This fairy tale horror film brings to life the gruesome original Italian fairy tales but needs to work on execution. The ""tales"" in the film in question are not done in singular chunks of story like a regular anthology but have their parts interspersed throughout the film. I know what they were trying to do but honestly it takes away some of the emotional investment you have in each individual stories. They wanted to connect these stories so much that the emotional connection the audience has to the characters is left behind. Another aspect of this film that I didn't care for was that it kept the misogynistic tone of the original fairy tales. (SPOILERS) The queen is hungry for a child at all cost, a princess is raped by an ogre and is brought to her father as a broken woman, the old sisters are vain and greedy for youth. (END OF SPOILERS) Stories like this could have seriously benefited from a more feminist interpretation. What redeems the film (somewhat) is the focus on the grotesque, the monstrous, and the violence found in the original fairy tales brought to strange and quirky light by intense performances by Salma Hayek, Toby Jones, John C. Reilly, and other great actors (who I greatly look forward to seeing in the future). It was definitely worth watching but I hope a reinterpretation of the Pentamerone comes again soon.",1480809600,2,1347,4.736170212765957

It should be pointed out that the source material was compiled by an early 1600s writer, Giambattista Basile, and like many folk, fairy, fantasy, myth stories from those years and prior they were dark, brutal, grim and unmannerly, but fit the times. Take a look at the original ""Little Red Riding Hood"" or more recently Roald Dahl as examples. Basile's collection of stories were an inspiration for many later writers such as the Brothers Grimm.

7599013,5,B01ACSKAR2,"This is from Director Matteo Garrone who brought us Gomorrah and Reality and is his first English language film. For it he has chosen to take three classic Italian Fairy Tales and weave a plot more cunning than a skulk of foxes. We meet the Queen of Longtrellis (Selma Hayek) who is prepared to lose her husband for her own ambitions. In another we have a wonderfully lascivious King played by the understatedly brilliant Vincent Cassel who falls for the charms of two sisters  who are not all they seem.

In the third we have a King (Toby Jones) who loves his daughter so much that he will only let her marry if a suitor should be able to pass a fiendishly difficult test of his own devising. The tales are told separately but are intertwined. The CGI is superb and the locations are often breath taking. The acting is excellent aided by the cinematography and an attention to detail that can only be marvelled at. The sets are top rate too and even as you suspend belief at some stage you do so, willingly as you have bought, heart and soul, into the stories.

These are Fairy tales for grown ups and there are some cringeworthy scenes here but the filth and detritus is juxtaposed with the fabulous wealth and stunning castles that the rich have. The morals of the stories are neither spelt out nor hidden and as such it is great trying to judge what the lesson(s) are. I completely loved this and the two hours flew, magically, by. I must mention actress Shirley Henderson who managed to steal a few scenes  and the make up was completely convincing. It has been a while since I have seen a film that has so much to praise that I can only recommend this very highly indeed.",1470787200,,1677,4.435064935064935

In one case, a character regains her youth and turns on her elder dependent and desperate sister, her youth subsequently withers away...bravo!  However, in another part of the somewhat dissparate stories, another spoiled female character is carrried away by an ""Ogre.""  However, crude, the Ogre appears to love her.  The female character uses the Ogre's love and trust to brutally murder him...apparently he's not good enough for her ""highness.""  Then, she appears to live ""happily"" ever after...this didn't set well with me; I didn't like the message of betrayal with no cost...sorry.

7599033,4,B01ACSKAR2,"Tale of Tales is an Italian film with some big name non Italian actors in some roles, such as John C. Reilly, and Selma Hayek . Everyone speaks English so even those not prepared to read movies, can get into this one.  Being it's Italian, it looks different than your typical American, British, Australian etc film.  There isn't a lot of dialogue, a lot of what is going on is told through imagery.  There is a bit of animal cruelty in it, that you don't regularly come across in English speaking country made films, which is a bit of shame as none of those animal interactions were really needed to tell the story.

Overall it's a nice visual film to watch.  Being that these aren't the fairy tales that have been done to death, you also might be surprised by elements of the plot.  I vaguely remember a fairy tale about a king and a flea from my childhood, but I couldn't remember how it went which is one of the tales covered in here.  It's fair to say that most characters in this film aren't exactly likable.  It's certainly not a tale that I regret seeing though.  The ending wasn't great though, as it seems to jump ahead in time with no explanation at how some characters even met, let alone would be participating in the ending.",1467504000,,1237,4.390350877192983

################SPOiLERS####################

The darker side of fairy tales (and some of them are pretty dark to begin with) is explored to no comprehensible end by inverting some and a passing ref to others, with varying degrees of obscurity. No children are involved -- there's no Hansel or Gretel or Red Riding Hood.

Expect refs to: Snow White, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Jack & the Beanstalk, Molly Whuppie, the Prince and the Pauper, Circe, Oedipus, Sleeping Beauty, Four Clever Brothers, etc. and typical fairy tale trials such as slaying the dragon, guessing something impossible to win the hand of the princess, a woman who must become young and beautiful to marry a king (and in so doing enrages her aged sister), a barren queen who cannot laugh.

It ends with a coronation; so much drama must involve more than one kingdom and the survivors all show up at the end. The one who wins the game of thrones here is a silly but crafty girl who murders her husband, who won her fair and square, and does actually care for her. Even if he is the actor who was in The Hills Have Eyes. She just thinks he's ugly and a brute. And she proves she is too, inside.

There are many grotesque moments, many pathetic and painful ones and very little joy. Men are portrayed as either young and handsome and useless, or rich, nutty, pathetic old pigs, and women as being interested in nothing but money and looks (their own). Only the gypsies represent a family loyalty that pulls together, and this weakness costs them their lives.

In the end, the message seems to be Look Out for Number One. Kindness, charity and love are all repaid with : And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.",1464393600,2,1784,4.662420382165605

But,I get the impression this is a ""European message film"" that simply did not translate for American audiences. Or, maybe I just don't get it. Gorgeous, but kind of empty.

PLOT
The story is alternating sequences following the remnants of three sets of royalty: mother and son, father and daughter, and a king without family who thrives on sexual conquest. At first glance, it appears set in the Medieval or Renaissance periods, but when the King of Longtrellis dons an armored diving suit to hunt a sea monster, we quickly come to realize ""Il racconto dei racconti"" is to be a fantastic tale.

ACTORS
Many great actors, here are a few:
 The formidable and wildly sexy Salma Hayek, both an actress (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frida/dp/B007HJ9LXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frida</a>) and producer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugly-Betty/dp/B003F3NDOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugly Betty</a>), is the unrelenting Queen of Longtrellis.
 Notable French actor Vincent Cassel is the King of Strongcliff, the licentious scoundrel archetype.
 The unforgettable Toby Jones (you've seen him in something) is the King of Highhills (a wise choice for the role), and Bebe Cave is absolutely perfect as Violet, his attention-starved princess daughter who gets more than she bargained for.
 The twins in Tale of Tales are not a product of special effects but are indeed two identical twins.

CINEMATOGRAPHY
Stunning. The early scene of Salma Hayek dressed in black sitting in a utterly white room eating a sea monster's bloody red heart is striking and sets expectations high. Locations are very well chosen, and it's often difficult to tell where our world ends and this fantasy world begins. The style so heavily used in Tale of Tales (not found enough in American cinema of this genre) provides an air where anything is possible.

 Final thoughts  This is not a family movie, mostly due to the lecherous King of Strongcliff, but then we already know from the Brothers Grimm that fairy tales can be pretty intense. Connecting all three crowns, the ending of Il racconto dei racconti is at once grand and understated, and is befitting of what we expect from a fairy tale ending. I hope this one gets its due in the States, but it may be destined to remain obscure here.",1463529600,18,2520,5.455012853470437

7599106,3,B01ACSKAR2,I imagine this is one of those movies made from a great book deep in meaning and plot. The movie fails at capturing that.,1463443200,,121,4.083333333333333
7599107,4,B01ACSKAR2,"Italian maestro Matteo Garrone switches from the brutal realism of ""Gomorrah"" to an equally compelling and equally brutal fabulism in his first English-language entry, a mind-bending, sexy, visually ravishing and very, very funny fairy tale for adults starring an amazing cast including Vincent Cassel, Toby Jones, John C. Reilly and Salma Hayek. (I admit Hayek is unusually wooden,  but the rest of the cast is brilliant.)

As the title suggests, this is a self-reflexive, deconstructive story about the power of storytelling It's adapted from a collection of tales from a 17th Century Italian author and features three parallel stories about the love lives and offspring of three royal families. Located ""once upon a time,"" which here is pictured as 17th Century Europe, the film cuts between the three stories:

In the first, Hayek stars as a childless queen who is offered a magical solution to her woes that requires the king (Reilly) to hunt a sea monster, cut out its massive heart and feed it to his wife.(Yum!) The potent magic spell leads to the birth of two kids - the second to a maid in the castle. The boys are identical twins and develop a close friendship which the queen finds threatening. There's scheming, more monsters. Lovely insights about the nature of true brotherly love.

Toby Jones is hilarious in the second tale about a widowed king who finds human relationships taxing. He is delivered when he meets and befriends a flea. The new bromance isolates him from everyone and he neglects his vapid if well-meaning and very lonely teenage daughter. As the months go by, the flea who grows bigger and bigger and bigger. A shot of Jones hugging this 300 pound insect and kissing its head is just wonderfully awful. Anywho... eventually dad needs to find his daughter a husband. That's when things get kinda weird. There's an ogre, a mountain side cave, an icky sex scene.

The third tale features an incredibly funny turn by Cassel as a perpetually horny king (several seriously hot sex scenes here) who falls in love with the voice of a poor working class wretch whom he sees only from the back. Turns out she's a very old, nasty looking woman who's so star struck -- and convinced she can shake the dude down for money -- that she plays along. Her more scurrilous sister objects but helps. Great early scene has her offer him her sister's finger to admire though the spy hole in her front door since it's the only part of either woman that's not disgusting. Eventually Cassel gets her into his bed ...

The long film (133 minutes) takes patience and imagination to enjoy, but a third of the way though I was totally hooked. The stories are fun, the visuals simply exquisite.",1463356800,2,2697,4.776824034334764
7599108,1,B01ACSKAR2,"I would rather watch paint dry. This was the dumbest movie I have every sat and watched!  It really slow going, abs as for sea creatures or mythical creatures.

Too mellow toned for my taste, I wanted action and adventure and it just didn't deliver.

I took a chance despite the ""truthful ring"" to the bad reviews -- the trailer looks so much better then the actual film.  My bad for tossing the dice with fingers crossed.

7599127,4,B01ACSKAR2,"These tales all focus on characters getting what they want and the price paid for their desire. Initially I found how the movie skipped between different stories a bit disorienting. I think skipping back and forth prevented me from getting too involved because the minute I got really into one story, another would suddenly pick up again.

The brutality of these stories keeps with the original source work although some of the dialogue is pretty predictable and stiff.

The ending image is beautiful and ominous. Achieving what we desire is a delicate balancing act, which can destroy us at any moment. The world is full of both miracles and horror and most of them inextricably linked.

I stuck with this movie until the end, in spite of the criticism written by others, because I thought that 'adult fable' meant a thought-provoking tale about profound philosophical issues.

No, none of that here.  The whole thing is just one horrific scene after another, with no moral message, and no moral redemption whatsoever;  which, I thought, was the point of fairy tales.  In this telling, old age is shamed, youth is put on a pedestal, the wicked triumph, virtue is powerless, and so on...

I really think the motive of the film makers was just to shock, and titilate.  There is nothing profound going on.  Nothing.  You WILL feel sick to your very core after having watched this movie.  I guarantee you.  :-(",1534291200,,885,4.945578231292517

Imagery was gross.  Gore, okay whatever, but naked women were even gross.  Why wasn't this X-Rated?  Story started sooo slllowwwly and slowed down.  I fast forwarded through parts.  And there ended up being no ending.  It just stopped.  Huh?
