7885412,2,6305223300,This Meteorites 2 Pack is NOT the same as the movie that was shown on television!  I bought this thinking it was the same movie I have been wanting to get even though it is not on DVD and I thought it was a good deal.  This 2 Pack is two movies about meteorites which I haven't seen yet since this is not the movie I was wanting.  I am not sure why it is saying it is the same as the movie that was on television and this is very misleading.  So PLEASE be careful when you purchase this 2 Pack since you might get a surprise like I did.,1247702400,6,536,3.8018018018018016
