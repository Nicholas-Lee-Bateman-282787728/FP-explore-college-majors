1690989,5,B000063K11,"This movie has everything: lost underground ""civilisations"", cave mutants, bikini clad cave bunnies, Barbeque Girl, Robbie the Robot (back after all these years with a new head and available for rent, cheap), dinosaurs, a spaceship, topless catfighting, swordplay, laserbolts, stock footage of a volcano and Sybil Danning bounding about in, and almost out of, very tight leather.  It just keeps rollicking along.

Who cares if it doesn't have a believable plot, a good script or decent acting?  If you want a decent laugh listen to the director's commentary and the interviews.  Shot in about six days on virturally no budget, nobody took this seriously, and neither should you.

The eye-candy keeps improving as the movie progresses, too.  Somebody in Hollywood must have made a fortune making bikinis for movies like this.  And Sybil Danning, almost busting out, bounds gleefully around the set, swinging a sword, glowering imperiously down her nose and trying not to laugh as she delivers her lines.  Sybil, the Mistress of the Master Race (she is Austrian) plays the Alien Queen.  (In this one they didn't let her carry a whip, but at the bequest of the other women on the set she punched out the leading actor.)  She is tall, athletic, gorgeous and sexy, which makes her one of my favourite actresses.  Who cares if she didn't have to act?  I've seen her act in other movies, but in this one, she just doesn't have to.

If you want a movie with reasonable T&A, a fast pace, a bit of a laugh and which requires no use of the grey matter at all, I recommend this.  If you want a good movie, forget it.",1153008000,33,1604,4.723021582733813
1690990,4,B000063K11,"The plot has more corn than a corn farm in Iowa. It is not just low budget, it looks like no budget. The humor is crude, the acting is not quite on par with the Tomb,a previous movie where most of the actors came from. But it is a cult classic type. I found it amuzing and a laugh every couple of minutes. The bare breasted cave bunny is odd but I believe that was thrown in to keep you from failing asleep. Overall worth the watch on boring evening when the reruns are showing.",1058486400,6,478,4.042105263157895
1690991,1,B000063K11,"Phantom Empire is a total waste of time and money.  In the view
of the director, the showing of a few bare breasts is an okay
substitute for story and characterization.  I kept falling
asleep while trying to watch this totally boring and completely
forgettable bit of film history.  I'd reveal the plot, but I
don't want to bore you.",1035763200,2,333,4.516666666666667

7959486,5,B000063K11,Phantom Empire is a great movie where Sybil Danning actually punches Ross Hagan so hard that he falls down.  I actually saw that was true in the extras.  All the women in the movie think that Jeffrey Combs who is a science student is so cute that they fall in love with him. Jeffrey Combs looks a little like McGyver.  Robbie the Robot is in the movie.  I also like the stop motion dinosaurs that remind me of the dinosaur movies of the 1920s.,1402617600,,443,4.238095238095238
7959487,5,B000063K11,"Really not a bad movie, everyone seemed to have fun making this.  I won't go into the plot, but the movie itself was very intertaining.  Loved Danning, and Baurer..  Hot ladies worth watching in anything.",1395100800,,204,4.771428571428571

7959490,3,B000063K11,"I bought this VHS Tape( Phantom Empire) almost 20 years ago & for the first time ( I think) since then I brought it back out & watched it again. Simplified( very)Susan Stokey bankrolls an expedition ( let's call it that) that aided by a map from Russ Tamblyn ( a casualty & only known survivor who came back from this area)seeks out a mysterious cave that offers the promise of great riches in the form of diamonds & other valuable rocks. Ross Hagen is the guide who puts the team together & Dawn Wildsmith is his tough as nails sidekick. Included in the team are Robert Quarry & Jeffrey Combs, Mineral/Archeological experts. The team on their way to discovering a lost world encounters Dinosaurs, Cavegirls & seemingly mindless creatures ( that have a problem with light & fire & look exactly like the Morlocks from the Time Machine). All this & now add Sybil Danning to the mix ( thank you) as a sexy Leather clad Alien that needs all involved to mine Diamonds that will fuel her ship away from us inferior beings. This film really disappointed me because so many of this troup are Fred Olen Ray regulars, especially Michelle Bauer( Cavegirl)Robert Quarry, Ross Hagen & Dawn Wildsmith. These are people that made Dinosaur Island & Beverly Hills Vamp a lot of fun. This is probably the most name laden ""B"" Movie I have seen yet the funny just doesn't arrive. Sybil Danning is the exception, this movie gets 1 star without her & 3 stars with her, she really command your attention  every time she is on camera, what a gifted actress. This movie is okay but expect to get a little dizzy watching people all movie long running around in circles & don't expect to be laughing your head off, it's not going to happen. Another reviewer mentioned anything with Ross Hagen in is can't miss. I like Ross a lot & he was good. It's most of the others that didn't leave us with much.",1283126400,,1872,4.489736070381231
7959491,5,B000063K11,"sybil danning plays a mostly quite roll here as the alien queen with little dialog.
whom shows up a little more than half-way into the film, the violence in this Mr.
Fred Olen Ray classic is good comic book. and the script is simple with ""some""
hard language though thankfully NO ""F""-BOMBS. michelle baur's cave bunny is all
body and sign language as communication which is a lot of fun to watch. please don't expect jurassic park here this is a b-movie which also stars jeffrey combs of
re-animater fame.buy and watch.:)

p.s the night owl theatre segment in the beginning is very funny,if you remember

7959492,3,B000063K11,This is a thrown together movie that you should buy only if you need to see a  early movie with an early Jeffrey Combs appearance in it...there is some nudity..a plus for some viewers..It has Sybil Danning as her usual tall rowdy self and Robert Quarry(Count Yorga) has a walk on part but not much else...the acting is sum par..i think on purpose sometimes...I did buy this movie on Amazon and i am happy with it cause i got what i expected...,1266624000,,443,4.402439024390244
7959493,2,B000063K11,"What a pure turkey. But then again if you're viewing this page you probably don't expect Oscar material. I traded my copy, but I didn't pay too much for it so I don't feel too cheated.

Avoid unless you're a fan of bad movies.

There are some special features that might appeal to fans of Fred Olen Ray or T&A in general, so at least there's that...",1257206400,,349,4.1940298507462686
7959494,3,B000063K11,"This is a cheapie starring legendary B-movie icon Ross Hagen as a master spelunker, scream queen Michelle Bauer as a ""cave bunny,"" and Sybil Danning as an alien queen. The plot is almost unbearably silly: some explorers and scientists go on a trek to the center of the Earth, where they discover a land of luscious prehistoric cave bunnies who can't speak a word, but who have crafted rather nice bikinis for themselves. The cave bunnies are entangled with a group of underground mutant cannibals (I never knew that when you roasted a live human female on a spit that you left her swimsuit on, removing only the jeans...) and the three parties spend the first half of the film chasing each other around the caves until a laser-wielding Robbie the Robot turns up to try to stop the fight, though he is defeated by the makeup mirror in a woman's compact. (Really. Don't ask.)

Eventually the explorers plus cave bunny Bauer emerge from the cave in (of course) a land that time forgot featuring an evil, but busty alien queen, Sybil Danning, in the most ludicrous vehicle I have seen in a long time. From then on there is a three way struggle featuring the explorers, the Queen and her minions, and stop motion dinosaurs clearly lifted from another movie (I believe they are from the same source as was seen in the altogether more entertaining ""Galaxy of the Dinosaurs."") They chase each other around the desert, wrestle, and encounter a volcano (more stock footage) before ultimately carjacking the Queen's vehicle, blowing it up in a cave, and finding themselves free on the other side of the cave with millions worth of diamonds they discovered in the desert. Confused? You will be.

This is essentially low-budget monster movie mayhem, and as such is camp of the highest order. It is stupid, but cheesily fun. I recommend it only to people who like campy, trashy mindlessly silly pictures starring yesterday's favorites from the B-movie circuit. The DVD has several extras including a commentary, and a sometimes (though mostly not) amusing introduction from Director Fred Olen Ray; this is part of his ""Nite Owl Theater"" series, which I hope he continues in the same spirit of Joe Bob Briggs. The drive in will live forever!",1166659200,21,2226,4.794270833333333
