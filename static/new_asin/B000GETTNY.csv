2606855,3,B000GETTNY,"This set could be an ideal way for the uninitiated to sample the films of Lugosi and decide if they want to commit to buying more, including better copies of ones presented here.

  First I'll address the logo. I looked forward in dread after reading that Passport always puts logos on the screen in their releases. I expected a large brightly colored emblem, drawing my eye away from the films. In reality it's a rather small faint image that I completely forgot about after the first three movies. In fact, if I had to testify, I couldn't swear in court that it was on every single one, but it probably is. Nevertheless there's no reason for it to be there.

  The first two discs are horrible. Midnight girl is pretty much the same quality you see on cheap editions of any silent film. White Zombie looks just like Platinum Disc's release in their Classic Horror collection. The Death Kiss is the worst of the first disc, with dozens of frame jumps and audio skips throughout. The Mysterious Mr. Wong looks okay, but the background hiss makes much of the dialogue difficult to make out. The pair of Chandu movies are easily the worst quality on the entire set. They look and sound like warmed over crap and that's all I'm going to say about the matter.

  Starting off the third disc, The Dark Eyes of London looks a little better, but it sounded like the speakers on my tv were crammed with cotton. Not hiss this time, just plain muffled sound. The Devil Bat looks the best I've ever personally seen it, but I hope to find a better copy someday. The Corpse Vanishes looks wonderful except for that logo, and the sound is great too. I wouldn't expect to see a better copy anywhere.

  The films on the fourth disc are all passable, although Scared To Death would probably look better if you turned the color on your tv all the way down, since it's main problem is that the colors fade and shimmer, and it's kind of distracting.

  Ironically, the Ed Wood films are the best looking ones in this set, and they occupy the final disc.

  I bought this set for a price that was less than a dollar per movie. Even at that price this wasn't a bargain for me because I had already seen most of these films, and now I'll still be buying them again to get the quality that I wanted. However, for those who are curious and have seen less than half of these movies, this is a good sampler of Lugosi in a variety of roles",1158019200,39,2412,4.382022471910112
2606856,4,B000GETTNY,"I've long been a Bela buff and caught a number of these on TV while growing up, usually in murky, nausea-inducing prints (with commercials). It's nice to have such a broad cross-section of his films all in one set, at a decent price. Generally better-than-average prints, especially on Devil Bat and Human Monster. It would've been nice to have some of the early Universal material in there, but those are out in other box sets, I think.",1155168000,4,437,4.688311688311688

8131230,4,B000GETTNY,"A great collection for an even better price. If you love Lugosi, then you can't go wrong with this collection. I'm a huge fan of old-school movies and was thrilled when I found this compilation. You can't go wrong.",1338854400,,214,4.512820512820513
8131231,5,B000GETTNY,"The worst movies Bela Lugosi ever made, all in one place.  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is just as awful as I remember it, none of the other films reach that level of suckage.  We bought this to have it playing in the background during our Halloween party, and our guests loved it.  I only wish there were a way to make all of the movies on each disc play sequentially.",1261526400,,366,4.126760563380282
8131232,2,B000GETTNY,"I was one of the many Classic Horror fans that got tricked into buying this neat,LOOKING set of classic Lugosi films.

Typical of this companies releases,the quality varies from decent to terrible.
And EVERY film has to have the company's logo at the bottom,so no one can bootleg there public domain prints.....gee,thanks!

The set could impress by rarer titles,but since many ARE available on other labels for cheaper prices(and better quality)it's not really worth it.
The Midnight Girl(1925) is the only rarity,everything else has been released on other sets and sold seperately.

The bonus is a documentary on Lugosi from the ""100 Years of Horror"" Box set,but honestly,i'd reccomend that you'd just buy that set.

Not a great set,seek out a MillCreek set if you want Lugosi on the cheap.",1228435200,4,791,5.061538461538461
8131233,3,B000GETTNY,"not bad.  started from the end and have been watching backwards in years.  some films seem like they have been edited but we're thinking it is just because they are so old.  Oldest ones, Bela is a ""good guy"".  Strange.  Some are boring. most are good.  not one of the best bunches of films but glad to have it to add to library.",1193961600,,328,4.126984126984127
