8760806,5,B01FIAXK26,"I think there's four documentaries all together made by the same team. They're all good with lots of talking heads from a lot of different musicians from LA's metal scene circa 78-89. it kept my interest the whole time, but I'm a huge metal/hard rock fan so...",1528848000,,260,4.553191489361702
8760807,5,B01FIAXK26,"All five of the DVD's from this series are 5 stars! Very comprehensive look at the LA metal scene in the late 70's-early 80's, a MUST BUY!! ALL of them",1523318400,,151,4.066666666666666
8760808,5,B01FIAXK26,"Very informative.  This film (like episode 1 of the series) captures both the feeling and the essential facts of how the Heavy Metal scene on the Sunset Strip, marginally started with the signing of Van Halen and the flood doors of which opened with Quiet Riot and Motley Crue, right through the change represented by Guns 'N' Roses.  The interviews in this episode 2 seemed to me much more meaty and detail-oriented than the interviews in episode 1, and if you really listen closely, you will pick up a lot of information just from the throwaway comments of the interviewees.  Those who really seek to understand the development of Heavy Metal in the 70s and 80s, its dominance in the 80s, and the beginning of its fractionalization into subgenres which typified the 90s, owe it to themselves to watch both episodes 1 and 2 of this series.  It is both educational and entertainment time well spent.",1520035200,,899,4.743589743589744

8760811,5,B01FIAXK26,"This one really answered a lot of questions if you did not experience the LA Rock n' Roll scene from the mid 80's.  As John Bush put it, ""things became polarized"" with the heavier bands, the glam bands, etc.  Then there was the arrival of Yngwie J. Malmsteen.  My favorite part of the movie is Grover Jackson discussing the time when Yngwie was brought to Jackson Guitars to have a guitar made for his own specifications.  Find out what happened!!! No spoiler alert here.  This DVD is something you will want to watch more than once, I assure you.",1474070400,,547,4.484848484848484
8760812,5,B01FIAXK26,Amazing documentary on the L A metal scene of the early 80s !!!!,1473465600,,64,4.0
8760813,5,B01FIAXK26,"Inside Metal The LA Scene explodes 2 picks up where the first movie left off in the era of the mid 1980's. Like the first movie key players in the Los Angeles Metal Scene are interviewed. Some of them are people who became big during that era and others were heavily in the scene and got left behind in the wave of bands from Los Angeles being swept up and signed by record labels. Tipper Gores attack on Heavy metal music that led to warning label stickers on albums deemed not suitable for minors. Inside Metal The LA Scene Explodes 2 covers what was happening in the LA metal scene at the time very well. They deliver the history just as the title says. I think this is a must own DVD for any one who is a fan of heavy metal music, a fan of music history in general and any one who is a fan of the Hollywood/Los Angeles music scene. Upon watching this documentary you can tell a lot of time and effort was put into obtaining all the interviews, fliers and photographs from this era for the film.",1472688000,,998,4.203125
8760814,4,B01FIAXK26,"Review- Inside Metal is a must own for any metal fan. This 76 minute journey, takes us back to the heyday of music, the eighties. They briefly cover topics such as, The PMRC, The Rise of Yngwie Malmsteen, the sessions for the charity song Stars, the LA Strip and so much more. The panel of people to discuss it are featuring Lars Ulrich (Metallica), Stephen Pearcy (Ratt), Carlos Cavazo (Quiet Riot, Ratt), Jack Russell (Great White), Don Dokken (Dokken), Dave Meniketti (Y&T), David Ellefson (Megadeth), Chris Holmes and Randy Piper (W.A.S.P.), John Bush (Anthrax and Armored Saint) and Joey Vera (Armored Saint), Mike Inez (Alice In Chains), Gene Hoglan (Testament, Fear Factory and Dethklok), Ron Keel (Steeler, Keel) and many more. I will say right now, the biggest negative was that they did not cover the topics more in depth. I would have loved this to be longer, and for topics like the fight with Tipper Gore to have been more than just a passing thought. I can remember, what that day meant to music. I can remember, that the warning label stickers, became a very popular t shirt.

I was happy that they covered Yngwie. We all know what a great player he is, and how gifted his fingers on that guitar are. I just wish, they could have had the man himself talk on here. I am pretty sure in 2012, he had some free moments to spare. I love this documentary better than the VH1 one that explored all the facets and sub genres of metal. I felt the VH1 and Sam had an agenda and wanted to feature only people who would pay to do it. To make money off your art in the form of a sheep is always a clever living to make. This documentary, makes me crave to see the other documentaries in this series to see what they have to offer. It was good to see Randy Piper looking alive. Chris Holmes though, still looks insane. I bet if Chris Holmes cut his finger and blood came out of the cut, everyone around him would be drunk by the smell alone. All in all, if you are a metal fan, this is a good little stroll down the 80s and so worth giving it a look or purchase. There were some surprise interviews on here that really made me happy. The bonus features contains a little more footage in the form of deleted scenes. I really cannot recommend this enough to the metal fan, as you have read.",1471996800,,2289,4.373239436619718
8760815,4,B01FIAXK26,"Continues along the same path as part one, but with some emphasis on Guns N Roses.
Enjoyable for those that came of age in the 80's.",1471564800,2,132,4.115384615384615
