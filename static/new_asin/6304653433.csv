7876632,5,6304653433,One of the best bank heist movies ever. I cannot believe Netflix does not have it.,1517184000,,82,4.1875
7876633,5,6304653433,"Seriously underrated film, right up there with (and more emotional that) The Killing, Asphalt Jungle, and Le Samourai.",1510272000,,118,5.611111111111111
7876634,5,6304653433,"I have an old VHS copy. It's one of my all time favorites. Excellent film making. I've watched it so many, many times. Still is interesting.",1427414400,,140,4.423076923076923
7876635,5,6304653433,Interesting and exciting movie.  Also has a supremely funny scene where the bank robbers fool the cops.,1405468800,2,103,5.0588235294117645
7876636,4,6304653433,"A great British heist movie! Bernard Hill is excellent as an alcoholic, out-of work computer expert  who is kidnapped and forced to help a gang break into a bank. A little dated but over-all a good movie with some quirky characters and memorable lines. The only drawback is the typical British sound quality....very poor.",1368144000,,321,4.944444444444445
7876637,5,6304653433,"A Handmade Films Production, This is the British caper film at it's best. A loving father ( a computer wiz ) is informed by those who are involved in the kidnapping of his son  that unless he assists them in their criminal activities he will never see his son again. Given a lukewarm reception by the critics, this film has an interesting story line and an ingenious ending.",1354320000,,374,4.5
7876638,4,6304653433,"This is a somewhat different presentation of a bank-robbery story involving an alcoholic computer expert blackmailed into service by some really sickening dudes who have kidnapped his son.  The head robber, code name Bellman, is a ghastly individual, as is his particularly unpleasant henchman, Gort.
Gort gets killed during the robbery in a horrific accident, an extremely disturbing scene that merely underscores the Bellman's coldness.  The accident portrayed is so unexpected, so heretofore out-of-place in this film, that its impact upon the viewer is stunning.  And at the same time, it could not have happened to a nicer guy.
This is a good movie to see once.  It's probably not one you'll want to view again, but you will want to lend it to friends.",1005177600,6,757,5.032
