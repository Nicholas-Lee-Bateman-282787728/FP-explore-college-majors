8247978,5,B0012VO5KC,"First off, Billy is crazy and so is his buddy TJ, but in a good way.  He's very entertaining and knowledgeable when it comes to hunting the Alaskan wilderness.  It gives a good idea of alot of what you can expect from the terrain, environment and the kind of shape you should probably be in to hunt the beautiful 49th state.  Excellent footage.",1348272000,,344,4.428571428571429
8247979,4,B0012VO5KC,"In the world of self produced hunting DVDs there are two kinds of crap.

Whilst the photo quality of this production isn't quite up to par, the rest of it is very good.

Entertaining, fun and a good look at Alaskan wilderness.",1324339200,,226,4.357142857142857
