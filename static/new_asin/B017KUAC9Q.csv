7507804,2,B017KUAC9Q,"Um, I am quite disappointed with this film for a few reasons but mainly for one reason...no nudity.  Nothing. Nada. Zip. Denied. Zero. Void. Shutout. Zilch. Goose Egg. Zot.  Diddly. Vigour.  Director Jim Wynorski usually comes through with this but not this time.  So, besides that...it's not really good.  Traci is great in it hence the two star rating.  If you like her, watch it.  But, she is not in it that much.  This could of been a good ""bad"" film but it wasn't.  It tried too desperately to be..um...bad.  If this was a made for SyFy Channel movie, I'd probably bump it up to a 3 star rating.  But, it wasn't.  Shame on you Jim...lol.  Still a fan though.",1462665600,7,663,4.425

7507807,2,B017KUAC9Q,"Fracking in Arkansas sets free underground cavern prehistoric sharks that can also borrow through land. Meanwhile five women from the Arkansas babes only prison are out on a work detail when one in the party runs into said sharks. There are two cops running around as well as a woman who aids the women escape into a shark infested trailer.

In the film Traci Lords calls Corey Landis' character ""chin"" and claims it is an obscure reference. The character's name is Adam Levine. If real life Tessanne Chin claims Adam Levine is the father of her child. There may have been more obscured references, but I missed them.

Appears to be a made for TV film.

7507827,4,B017KUAC9Q,"I've seen a lot of shark movies, and when I saw the title ""Sharkansas Women's Prison Massacre"" I realized that director Jim Wynorski had hit on one of the most perfect combinations of B-movie genres in history. I, of course, ordered it based on the title alone. That strategy frequently disappoints (e.g. when I found myself afflicted by the truly appalling ""Psycho Shark""), but here it was bad movie nirvana. Starring Traci Lords as the tough cop Detective Kendra Patterson and a whole lot of girls who were not primarily hired for their acting abilities (as well as a couple of guys), the film surprisingly has no nudity.

The film features a deliciously hilarious plot: at the opening evil frackers blow up some stuff in a mine in Arkansas; after doing their detonation duties they take their truck across a bog, which is ill-advised, because they have inadvertently opened up the earth to connect the world's aquifers with subterranean prehistoric sharks, which promptly attack them in their truck. There are actually a couple of decent underwater scenes in here, and some of the cinematography in the woods and swamp is better than expected. This transitions to Lords and her partner Adam (Corey Landis) looking for clues to a robbery in the same swamp, but they get more than they bargained for when they stumble on a mangled body and a lunatic babbling about sharks. Meanwhile two other cops are transporting five suspiciously attractive female prisoners to a work site in the swamp where they are going to dig up stumps. The girls in their Daisy Dukes stay hydrated by pouring water all over themselves, but one promptly gets herself eaten by a shark.

While the prisoners are in transit, Honey (Dominique Swain), who does not know how to hold a gun, holds up the prison van with a ludicrously complex plan because she's the girlfriend of one of the prisoners. A melee ensues in which a deputy escapes and gets shot in the process; at one point he knocks Honey out but runs off and doesn't take her gun. He was not the top graduate in his police academy class, obviously, and for all his trouble ends up getting eaten by a shark in a sewer. (A sewer? In a swamp? Oh, never mind.)

Honey takes the girls and the one surviving cop to a hideout in the woods, and in a completely random subplot, discovers a first edition copy of Charles Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities"" to read. (Seriously movie?) Honey and her girlfriend retire to their literary pursuits while the other three girls take a soak in the hot tub and decide they want out of this jailbreak. Before you can say ""Carcharodon carcharias"" sharks burrow through the dirt with their armored snouts to eat another girl. They all go into the woods to investigate (""That was no wood chipper!"") After making a meal of peaches and beans (they really mix peaches and chili, which made me queasier than any of the sharks gnawing on flesh scenes), two geologists who are in the woods to monitor the fracking show up at the vinyl-sided outlaw cabin. They reveal...hold on to your seat...that the frackers have unleashed the Sharkasaurus! No, really! It's millions of years old and has lived under the Earth's crust for millennia and is equally predatory in water and on land. As you might have guessed, this means they are all now trapped in the house with sharks burrowing all over the yard.

Conveniently for their predicament, they find a heap of machine guns and ammo in the kitchen cabinet while inmate Shannon (Amy Holt) and junior geologist John (Oscar DeRosa) go for a romantic stroll in the woods. Ponder that. Meanwhile, the surviving guard, Carl (John Callahan, who turns in by far the best performance in the film), has wrestled control of the group from Honey with Michelle (Christine Nguyen) as his right-hand woman. They agree to band together and end the hostage scenario and arm everyone to the teeth. It turns out it's the start of the annual shark swarm, a kind of spring break for sharks, and 1,000 sharks are on their way to the cabin. They use an astonishing decoy to get out of the house and into a cave because sharks can't burrow through rock, but there are causalities. This leads to them wandering around in the cave and hearing the sharks talk to themselves like whales. It also leads to the wonderful line ""If I didn't know better, I'd think we just had an encounter with a land shark!""

As the cast gets progressively thinned the two good guys (Lords and her partner) find an app on their tablet that finds sharks in caves. The stirring conclusion involves extensive use of a rubber dinghy, a totally psychotic episode of gunfire with unexpected results, many fewer cast members, and a particularly enjoyable shark feeding frenzy. I'm not going to tell you how many people survive, but I will say that justice is done, and while you might not be surprised, you will be amused.

It's pretty obvious that ""Sharkansas Women's Prison Massacre"" isn't a good movie, but it works well as an enjoyable B-movie because it has a ludicrously outlandish premise and plot and the characters play it absolutely straight. This is clearly meant to gently poke other (better) movies, spoofing many tropes from a various sources, but the complete absurdity of it with the straitlaced cast makes this one of the more enjoyable B-movies I have seen in a while, especially in the shark subgenre. If you like cheesy movies, this is an eye-rolling feast of the senses.",1480636800,2,5429,4.7215189873417724

Also the roadway was a self healing surface after the sharks swam through it.  Obviously th Arkansas Dept of Corrections sees benefits in providing identical very cool clothing to the inmates that allow maximum cooling for the voluptuous ladies as they labor in the hot weather in th outback of Arkansas.  The town where the film was made looks a lot like Florida, especially with the Palmetto plants and Florida locations.

8739621,4,B017KUAC9Q,"Sharkansas Women's Prison Massacre has all the elements of a killer B-Movie and definitely does not disappoint. Obviously, this film falls more into the genre of comedy than it does horror. It features ridiculously bad CGI, a plot that makes no scientific sense whatsoever, acting so inept that it couldn't possibly be performed that badly by accident and production values that make you wonder if they spent any money making the movie at all.

Surprisingly, the only thing common to most modern day B-Movies that you won't find in this one are nudity, bad language and a lot of cheap gore. The gore is cheap, to be sure, but there is very little of it for a movie that features man-eating prehistoric sharks. There are a couple of risque scenes, but the majority of the film is actually pretty family friendly.

If you enjoyed the ""Tremors"" series of films or Sharknado, you will likely really enjoy this movie. The only reason that I won't give this movie a five star review is the performance of Tracy Lords. She seemed to be the only one in the movie not in on the joke and her part has nothing whatsoever to do with the overall plot. It almost seems like the director had some B-Roll footage of her that he decided to splice into the film to make it longer.

If you are looking for a movie with a coherent plot or good acting, this definitely isn't the movie for you. If you are looking for 90 minutes of campiness and laugh out loud fun this film definitely delivers.",1526688000,,1473,4.50936329588015
