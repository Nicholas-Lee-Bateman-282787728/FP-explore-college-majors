949105,5,6304922329,"In this tape the first enemy of the characters appears as well as yet another new character.  In this tape you will get a glimpse as to Tenchi's origin and destiny.  You'll also learn a little about where Ryoko came from  and how she was born.  Plus if you have watched the previous episodes,  you'll also see why Ryoko did the evil things she did and how she was  forced to do it.  In this tape you'll see the warrior forms of Ayeka,  Ryoko, and Tenchi.  You get to see a clue about Tenchi's grandfather and  why he is the way he is.  Here the dramatism behind the series will really  flare up and you'll see Ryoko do domething unthought of.  Don't worry I'm  not ruining it but it has something to do with a person's eyes when they're  in grief. If you want comedy with a great story and a nice slow building  drama then I believe you'll like the Tenchi collection.  Think about?",958521600,,881,4.242424242424242

7880717,5,6304922329,"Only one word can describe this! AMAZING!!! The 1st Episode on this tape accually made me cry the 1st time I saw it, not because it was sad, but because it is ART! The second episode is just what you expect from Tenchi Muyo! OAV, It is HILLARIOUS, plus it has alot of insight into ALL the characters past, and personallitys This Volume is amazing but, if you haven't seen the unedited versions of Vol. 1-7 you won't understand most of the humor or emotion so, be sure to buy those ones 1st (if you can wait for this one that is ^_^)",990316800,,532,4.174757281553398
7880718,5,6304922329,"This volume has two episodes from the Tenchi Muyo! OAV. The first episode is 'Zero Ryoko.' It is when Dr. Clay, a old classmate of Washu is sent by Tokimi (one of the three goddesses of Jurai) to capture Washu. They go to Earth. Dr. Clay sends his 'killer' call 'Zero.' In order to capture Washu, Zero turns into Ryoko and brings Ryoko to Dr. Clay. The next episode is called ""Here Comes Jurai!"" It is when Azusa, Funaho, and Misaki come to Earth to get Ayeka and Sasami back to Jurai. Azusa is the Emperor of Jurai and Funaho & Misaki are the queens. They force them to come back home but they refuse. Azusa then tells them in order for them to stay, Tenchi has to beat Seiryou, Ayeka's pink-hair suitor. If Tenchi wins, Ayeka and Sasami stay on Earth. Who will win the battle? Tenchi--the lady crazed boy, or Seiryou -- the pink hair suitor?

7880720,5,6304922329,This volume contains my all time favourite tenchi episode-the one with the Kagato/Tenchi battle.  A must see series and one of my fav!,973382400,,134,4.826086956521739
7880721,5,6304922329,"This is probibly the first Tenchi Muyo episode that's more serious than it  is funny, but who really cares!?!  There is still plenty of humor to keep  us laughing throughout most of the show!  And these episodes even include a  kicken battle scean with Tenchi and Kagato (I think I'm spelling that  right)!  Plus for the first (And probibly only time) in the show Ryoko  shows some real feelings for Tenchi!  This is a great tape that any Tenchi  Muyo fan should get!",969148800,4,467,4.518072289156627
7880722,4,6304922329,its preety cool it has action it has adventure and the best part ryoko and  ayeka fighting killing each other a life tenchi rather die but its cool and  buster you better give me a good rate our pay me.,968630400,,202,4.025
7880723,4,6304922329,"The evil kagato attacks the Tenchi gang after kidnapping Ryoko and discovering the incredible power of Tenchi's sword. The resulting battle spans two episodes and includes some important revelations, and the  introduction of the very kyoot, VERY intelligent Washu, the greatest  scientist in the universe. This video is classic Tenchi all the way, loaded  with killer action sequences, intriguing character development and  hilarious comedy. This is also one of three real battle sequences in the  entire OVA series and in my opinion the best. Only a few things mar this  otherwise wonderful video, other than Pioneer's usual B grade dub work, it  can be extremely confusing on the first viewing and is pretty much  unwatchable without viewing at least the two previous tapes. That aside, I  reccomend this to anyone with eyes in their head.",961027200,,841,5.17037037037037
7880724,5,6304922329,"IMHO, this is the best of the Tenchi videos.  Yosho's secret is uncovered, the mysterious Tsunami and the villanous Kagato are introduced, Tenchi's powers mature, and we meet the cutest scientific genius in the galaxy,  Washu!  The visuals are stunning, especially the Tsunami scene and the  battle between Kagato and Yosho.  And the relationships get more indepth.  Why IS Ryoko bothering to save Ayeka's life, anyway? While the video,  overall, takes a more serious tone than the rest, we get a glimpse of the  hidden complexity and emotional depth of the Tenchi series (the first one,  anyway).",958867200,2,597,5.072164948453608
