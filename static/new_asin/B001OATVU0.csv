8330041,5,B001OATVU0,"I had no idea that our adult cravings for comfort food form during our few few years on this planet. The material in this Dvd was absolutely fascinating! While I am not a parent yet, I found the information very applicable to my own life. And if I ever become a father, I will be mindful of the foods that I will feed my kids.

Bottom line: I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is interested in early childhood development!",1286755200,,427,4.271604938271605

A peak at the past sure, but what about solving today's temptations.  Showing me what was wrong when I was a child is not enough.",1285891200,,253,4.478260869565218
