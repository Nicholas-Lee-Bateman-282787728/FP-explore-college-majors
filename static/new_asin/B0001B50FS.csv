1985670,5,B0001B50FS,"This is a great video by 1 guy who made the 6 week trip by raft & on foot hunting in Alaska for moose, caribou & dall sheep.
The scenery is beautiful & it's like your there with him.
I highly recommend this video, well worth the money!!!
Amazing 1 guy did this video alone where other videos take 2 or even 3 people to do.
Great video!!!!!!!!",1078444800,2,342,4.044117647058823
1985671,5,B0001B50FS,With out a doubt this video is the most exciting all time sitting on the edge of your seat movie. I only wish I could have been there with him while this video was being made. I hope some day to be able to say that I was able to do just half of what was in this adventure. Buck if there is any way I could have the pleasure to hunt with you please let me know. The only other thing I can say is you don't want to miss this chance to see all that alaska has to offer in this collection of footage.  ...... HOPE TO SEE YOU SOME DAY.

1985672,5,B0001B50FS,"I have lived in Alaska several years and I can say with out a doubt, this video captures Alaska's beauty from start to finish.  It takes a look at the remoteness Alaska has to offer; from contract bush plane operations, very very remote Dall Sheep adventures, moose and caribou trekking, the rigors and triumphs of remote river rafting to the ultimate harvesting of big game animals, this video has it all.
I rate this video an easy 5 star rating.  Scotty.",1077408000,10,456,4.617283950617284
1985723,5,B0001B50FS,"Incredible! I envy Buck so much! Living near Fairbanks his backyard is ANWR and the Brooks Range.
His only problem will be that Obama will very likely use the Antiquities Act to morph ANWR into a Natl. Monument right before he leaves office as part of his ""scorched-earth"" transformation of America......
For those of you who may not think that's a big deal, well, IT IS! You see ANWR is already plenty protected by federal law (which I don't really have too much of a problem with). However too much of the Brooks Range is already closed to all hunting and trapping as those huge pieces of land have already been SEIZES by the Feds under the ""Noatak Natl. Preserve"" and ""Gates of the Artic Natl. Park."" Once Obama SEIZES ANWR (a MASSIVE piece of pristine land in far northeast AK),  that too will be completely closed to outsiders coming in to legally hunt and trap. I could be wrong, but if you really know what Obama is truly all about, it only makes sense that even more federal control of places like ANWR are a top priority...... Thank the ""R-Party"" for being the gutless linguini-spines that they are..... Screaming about how Obama can't do this and shouldn't do that, and then turning around and giving him everything he wants at the expense their own constituents! All the while racking up another $10 trillion in debt in only 8 years!",1467590400,,1344,4.6
1985724,5,B0001B50FS,Videography left a little to be desired but this was a great movie. Buck Nelson made you feel like you were right beside him in the wilds of Alaska.,1466899200,,148,4.137931034482759
1985725,5,B0001B50FS,Fascinating and inspiring video. Unlike any other... Highly recommend it.,1460246400,,73,6.4
1985726,5,B0001B50FS,Love it,1456876800,,7,3.0
1985727,5,B0001B50FS,"You get the real deal with movies that Buck makes. He's a one man operation and goes to a lot of effort to bring the wilderness experience to his viewers (no Hollywood glitz here). Consider the scenes where he's rafting down a river, he has to set the camera up, raft by, and then go and retrieve the camera. No small effort. I really enjoy his movies and appreciate the effort he made to record the experience.",1453852800,,411,4.35064935064935
1985728,2,B0001B50FS,"For me, somewhat interesting for home video footage. Great trip. Price is far too high in my opinion, I wouldn't pay over $10. Not too excited to watch it twice or share.",1449532800,,170,4.34375
1985729,5,B0001B50FS,A gift for my father-in-law. He seemed to really like it.,1428537600,,57,4.2727272727272725

1985731,5,B0001B50FS,I saw this video the other day. I can say it started a little slow but then I just couldn't stop watching. Such a good adventure. I hope i find time in my fife to do something like this.,1421452800,,186,3.7948717948717947
1985732,5,B0001B50FS,"Wow, what a guy. Let me put it this way: If you ever think you'd like to take a hunting trip thru Alaska, watch this video first and see, if you are up to the Challenge.  Unless you are seasoned hunter like him, I'd think twice of going out there by myself. Bruce Nelson has a deep respect for nature, that becomes obvious right from the start. For people complaining about not seeing the shot he takes, etc. Let me explain one thing to you guys: Did you ever go hunting by yourself, tracking an animal, having a camera with you and filming the whole thing during a shot ? How would that be possible ? I'm currently reading one of his books as well. He is the true outdoors-man and would be an honer to meet him someday !",1384560000,3,721,4.15
1985793,5,B0001B50FS,Watching this DVD ignites the spirit of adventure!  Splendid scenery and  good wildlife footage.  Audience is able to tell that Buck has a love for the outdoors and appreciates what he is doing.,1358121600,2,194,4.818181818181818
1985794,5,B0001B50FS,My dad is an avid hunter for many years. My parents just took a trip to Alaska this year so I thought this would be a perfect gift.,1357257600,2,131,3.7142857142857144
1985795,5,B0001B50FS,Fantastic video.  None of the usual hype and high-five kill shots - one after the other.  This is how hunting is supposed to be.  It's about being outdoors in nature.  Bringing meat home is just the icing on the cake.,1320883200,2,217,4.35
1985796,5,B0001B50FS,"This is a great video considering the entire thing is self shot.  Anyone that can spend a month in the wilderness living it up and produce a quality product like this deserves a good review.

Not 100% sure why he didn't take the wolverines, wolves, and bears he came across.  maybe he has a house full of them.

Loved it and I watch it every couple of months.

Real Alaska!",1315353600,2,373,4.271428571428571
1985797,5,B0001B50FS,"I was worried I wasn't going to receive my video before christmas... but it came very fast, was in perfect condition and my father in law loved it :)",1294876800,,149,4.172413793103448
1985798,5,B0001B50FS,"Buck Nelson's videos are the best.  My husband and I can watch them over and over again and every time we get just as excited as the first.  They inspire us to go on our own new adventures and you really do feel like you are along with him for the journey.  We like to hunt, fish, raft, and camp, and Buck's style of adventure is much like our own.  It is refreshing to see a hunting video where even when he doesn't bag the animal, he still marvels at the experience and enjoys being out in the wilderness of Alaska...which is where we live too.",1273622400,2,546,4.122641509433962
1985799,4,B0001B50FS,I liked this movie it wasn't all hollywood edited and retaped.  It was 1 guy making a documentary of his trip.  I thought it was interesting and plan on buying some of his other movies.,1271548800,,185,4.257142857142857
1985800,5,B0001B50FS,"If I could give this 6 stars I would. I loved this video and Buck does a wonderful job of capturing the wildlife, scenery and the power of Alaska all by himself in this solo adventure. He has a great way of allowing you to share the experience and you feel like you are there. This video  inspired a trip of my own that I will never forget. Thanks Buck and keep them coming!",1259280000,,374,4.054054054054054
1985801,5,B0001B50FS,"I thought that this was a great video.  Buck hunted from the time the aircraft landed until he took off again; something like 6 weeks.  The thing that struck me the most was the fact that he didn't do a thing that I couldn't do, and I found that very compelling.  I am almost 54, and I could do that.  A step slower perhaps, but I could do it.  The folks who have reviewed this video and feel like there is not enough hunting have missed the point.  This video is all hunting, and very little killing.  Hunting is a process and the end result is a successful kill.  The kill is a very small part of the hunt, and the really fun part is being out there for the hunt.  Buck did it right and I can't wait to see the ""1000 Miles Alone"" video!",1259193600,,738,4.0
1985802,5,B0001B50FS,"This is not HD quality video, but I didn't expect it to be. I'm sure
it was shot with a hand-held. The hike through the mountains and float
down river is great. I have not hunted Alaska, but do like to hike it
and really enjoy the wilderness and wildlife when I can get up there; I
have great respect for the Alaskan weather and remoteness; you get a good
taste of it here. It felt like I was almost on this adventure. Observed
animal behaviors and geographic locations I have not seen before, and may never see in person. It was also interesting to observe and listen to an
experienced outdoorsman narrate through wildlife situations that would probably unnerve me - like comming across a brown bear burying it's
kill. There were no drawn out stalks nor kill shots, but IMHO those details
weren't needed. It was a neat adventure that the author put together and
you get a really good taste for what's up there, and how it's done. If you
are into this sort of activity, ... it was well worth my money and time to
tag along for a little bit of the ride.",1250380800,,1052,4.318181818181818
1985807,2,B0001B50FS,"The previous reviews had me believe that this movie would be full of great scenery (no real hunting) and great photography of Alaska.  The photography is only slightly better then a home movie.  A lot of out of focus shots, and he shakes a lot too.  A tripod would of helped!  I would not buy this movie if I had the opportunity to view it first.  I wanted to like it .... but it was not well filmed.",1249430400,2,400,4.076923076923077
1985808,5,B0001B50FS,"The best element of this video is you can picture it as your own adventure.  Unlike most video's and today's big production videos, Buck succeeded in this adventure with no assistance or life line from the outside; he planned a multi-week backpacking and rafting trip and documented it better than most could by themselves.  He made realistic decisions based on his own safety and I could sense his edginess with bear encounters (which would have been my biggest concern).  The sheer effort put into the Ram hunt was motivating, and it was actually refreshing to see him fail and call the hunt a success simply because of the experience and adventure.  It would have been cool to see better footage of him stalking big game and watch all the angles of him making the kill; but that would have required a team of people to pull off the footage and would have taken away from the single element that makes this a spectacular video.  Even though I live in Alaska the odds of getting 6 + weeks off, planning and affording an adventure like this is unlikely.  For now this video is a realistic look into what it ""might"" be like.  I recommend this video to anybody who admires inner strength and adventure.",1203465600,2,1200,4.605633802816901
1985809,2,B0001B50FS,"This is not bad for an amateur type video. I had expected a more professional production to be on sale at Amazon, well I guess I learnt something too. One cannot take away from the fact that the hunting trip recorded is a remarkeable achievement and I am envious particularly since I live in the southern hemisphere and a long way from Alaska. A great story but the production quality is not up to the same standard.",1197936000,2,416,4.415584415584416
1985810,5,B0001B50FS,"This video captures the hunt, and almost everything that goes with it, directly from the hunter's eye. There is no hype, political or environmental propaganda, no ""Hollywood"" narration, no ""spin"" of any kind and no ulterior motives.

The videographer travels hundreds of miles by foot and raft in remote North Eastern Alaska, a wild, isolated, game-rich area held in deep reverence by experienced bush residents, hunters, trappers and dreamers.

Views of of wolves, wolverines, grizzlies, sheep, moose and caribou are personal, if not always ""up close.""

Indeed, the best part of this video is that you see things the way you would if you were an isolated, solitary hunter in the area today, or thousands of years ago.

It's also enough to make you think that you could put together a trip like this yourself; that if you were in good physical condition, could exercise common sense (essential for solitary wilderness travel!), and if you had sufficient experience and equipment that you could hunt this country in this way.

The single complaint I have about this video is that you never see ""the moment of truth."" Not once do you hear the crack of Buck's hunting rifle, which looks like the venerable ""get-it-done"" .30-06.

I'd also have liked more shots of camp. I've spent lots of time in the outdoors and one of the best parts is setting up camp, relaxing around a camp fire and then crawling into a warm sleeping bag and falling asleep to the sound running water, wind and wild animals. There are a few shots of camp, the campfire and the tent but not many. Of course, that sort of thing can be boring to some people.

I'm going to venture that many of us are cut from the same mold as Buck, and that--whether we realize it or not--in one incarnation or another we were hunters, that hunting is woven into the double-helix of our DNA and lives in the wild, primevil instinct deep in our hearts and in the core of our souls.

This is a terrfic video. I watched it every night for the first two weeks I owned it. And I recommend it to anybody who loves hunting, remote wilderness travel, isolated living or the outdoors.",1181260800,8,2124,4.645333333333333
1985811,5,B0001B50FS,"Very exciting, informative video of a journey across remote Alaska. A great primer to help get you motivated for that Alaska hunting trip.",1180915200,4,138,5.043478260869565
1985812,5,B0001B50FS,I would have to rate this DVD a 5 also. I have hunted Alaska all my life and although I have never gone 700 miles alone it brings back alot of memories. I generally don't buy videos because I tend to watch something only once but I have watched this 3 times the first week I had it and will watch it again and again. Definately worth the money.,1175644800,3,344,4.0
1985813,3,B0001B50FS,"I live in Alaska and I would like to say that this video is a great documentary of Alaska's remote wilderness.  It shows all kinds of wildlife and fish from grizzlies to wolves.  I new this was an adventure film, but i also thought i was buying a hunting video too... Before you read the next part I want you to know that I am a very ethical and responsible hunter, I only hunt to fill the freezer so my family can survive.  I watch hunting videos so that i can become a more efficient and humane hunter, so please don't take offense to fact that i didn't like this film because it didn't show the guy making any kills... The adventure was good despite the fact that the guy was a little boring, but when it came to hunting there was very little footage.  It didn't show hardly any stalks and it didn't show him take down any animals.  Plus all he shot was caribou, when i made the purchase I was under the impression that he also bagged Dall sheep and moose.  If I wanted a film that was just observing wild animals I would have saved my 20 bucks and just watched the Discovery Channel.",1175212800,18,1087,4.201923076923077
1985814,3,B0001B50FS,"Anyone who has been to Alaska would appreciate the amazing scenery, especially the shots from very remote areas that most visitors wouldn't access.  the video quality is a bit rough, but understandable considering the circumstances. i do recommend this to anyone who has thoughts of hunting in AK.",1122595200,4,297,5.1875
1985815,5,B0001B50FS,Perhaps THE BEST hunting/adventure video I've ever had the pleasure of watching. My husband is still raving about it 3 weeks later. I felt compelled to watch EVERY moment of this video. Well worth every penny.,1121644800,5,209,4.833333333333333
1985816,5,B0001B50FS,"Very nicely put together video. In our world today of big corporate studios making todays hunting videos, this video shows that you can just document the beauty of the landscape without having to show huge racked animals being harvested in order to get the results of a great hunting video. My grandfather always told me that 90% of hunting was enjoying and respecting the beauty of the landscape. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
