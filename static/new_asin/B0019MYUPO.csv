8274837,5,B0019MYUPO,"This video changed my life when I was a young woman eager to discover my sexuality while a graduate student at the University of California, Riverside.  It helped me see sex and erotic pleasure from and entirely new perspective.  I began to imagine how one could learn to be a good lover the way one learns to be a good painter: by practicing, practicing, practicing.  I've done that and the result is a very happy life.  In my wisdom years I've had the joy and privilege of meeting and working with Annie Sprinkle.  She had inspired my work as well.  Thank you, Annie Sprinkle, you are my hero.",1384041600,2,595,4.462962962962963
