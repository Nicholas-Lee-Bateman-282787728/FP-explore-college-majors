The Collection that VCI provides in it's LEGENDARY OUTLAWS series were all shown over and over again on TV in the 1950s, and then, as the Majors began to give up movies to the small screen, these little gems disappeared.  Well, now they are back!

I didn't think that RENEGADE GIRL, and GREAT JESSE JAMES RAID held up too well over time, however the three Don 'Red' Barry entries remain very watchable, low budget westerns.

The pick of the litter is THE RETURN OF JESSE JAMES, starring the ever brooding, emoting John Ireland. This is one that VCI could easily package with their WESTERN NOIR selections.  A nice script, tight direction and fine cast, lift this one head and shoulders above the rest.  It would also make a nice companion piece for Lippert's I SHOT JESSE JAMES, which also starred Ireland.

The entire collection is restored to top-notch quality, and has some nice bios.  Another good job from VCI and Kit Parker.",1159747200,8,1184,4.685990338164252

""The Great Jesse James Raid"" is the best movie, but pictorial quality (AnscoColor) not quite as good as the others.  I've not seen these movies since on TV in the 1960's, and they are really a lot of fun.  I hope they can sell enough of these Lippert movies to justify releasing more.",1149984000,9,408,4.472972972972973
