6283519,4,B00IO5G5S4,Struggling with dating? Watch this film. Don't fit the mold? Watch this film. Dealing with bullying? Watch this film. Know a ginger? watch this film! A seemingly simple film about a red haired man looking for love ends up dealing with a wide range of issues from identity to bullying in a honest and humorous way. A film for anyone ginger - or not!,1394064000,2,348,4.453125
6283520,3,B00IO5G5S4,Not bad for College level documentary.  But unless you are ginger or love a ginger  probably not for you.,1454544000,,105,4.473684210526316

6283522,1,B00IO5G5S4,"This guy is a f***ing sap.
He is a grown man who still thinks people hate him because of discrimination he faced as a child due to the colour of his hair.
Self-indulgent tripe.

I can only hope this made him eventually feel better about himself so nobody ever has to sit through a sequel.",1454198400,2,288,4.236363636363636
6283523,5,B00IO5G5S4,"It wasn't until several months ago when I heard a  program on Public Radio that red headed people were discriminated against in England. I was totally taken aback. This movie deals with the subject and is focused on an American guy living in Britain who himself is a ""ginger."" Even he didn't like ginger women. One certainly can understand why when you hear his experiences as a child and listen to some of the interviews. The one woman who was interviewed on the street would have made a great Nazi. She apparently has no guilt about expressing herself no matter what terrible things she said to him about her dislike of people with red hair. When she was asked if was right that people should suffer because they were being mistreated because of the color of their hair. Her response was that they should get used to it in time. Everyone seems to be upset because he wants a beautiful woman and not taking into account other attributes. Just remember that the movie is about discrimination and being told you are not attractive to others. That is the focus of the subject - being accepted for how you look, not being rejected because of your appearance. Scotland has had a Ginger Pride Parade. You don't have Pride parade unless there is a need for such.",1454198400,,1256,4.582222222222223
6283524,4,B00IO5G5S4,Kind of sad.  Makes you think about how WORDS can hurt a person for life.,1453507200,2,73,3.8666666666666667
6283525,3,B00IO5G5S4,"The documentary itself was OK I guess.  It didn't really seem to have much of a plot, and Scott Harris (the ginger) didn't seem to grow as a person over the course of the film.  He's still the same desperately awkward ""nice guy"" who's trying way to hard to hook up with women who are way out of his league.  Harris isn't inherently unattractive, but his oral fixation and overtly forced attempts at extroversion don't help his cause. He either had his hand in his mouth or was biting his lip for a good chunk of the film.

The best part of the movie is definitely the blonde woman with the ""Ginger Nuts"" story.  That was amazing.  It really made the movie.  That woman should have her own comedy special.  If Harris really wanted to make a film that showed that bullying gingers was wrong then he should have gone about it differently.  Maybe start by not having a main character who is a dorky ginger that refuses to date other gingers, and don't include anti-ginger interviewees that are that hilarious.",1453075200,,1005,4.50828729281768
6283526,5,B00IO5G5S4,"really great! very relatable and even moving at times, but still funny and light. I enjoyed it tremendously.",1452470400,2,108,5.055555555555555
6283527,1,B00IO5G5S4,I watched this hoping id learn thing about red heads from a biological or sociological standpoint. I watched a dude be somewhat nervous and annoying about girls.,1448841600,2,161,5.0

6283530,3,B00IO5G5S4,"This documentary centers itself around a man who is trying to come to grips with how and why he was mistreated growing up 'ginger,' and also, how the world, in his view, doesn't embrace modern gingers (even though he is bombarded by happy ginger couples throughout the doc). The problem I have with this doc (well, one of several), is that the director only wants to be with a woman that he finds attractive (physically beautiful). Not a woman who is smart, witty, funny, eccentric in a good way, loyal, caring, etc. In fact, he doesn't even like ginger women at all until nearly the end of the doc, when he finally meets a ginger girl that he finds 'beautiful.' Totally lame, and it's obvious why none of the women find him interesting enough to go out with him past their initial date. Really, this doc would probably have been more aptly named Beauty and the Ginger. Because I was hoping that this guy would realize by the doc's end, that all of the hate he was/ is carrying around inside of him is due not to his red hair, but him realizing that he's just sort of a lame, ugly person who needs a whole lot of counseling. Maybe he'll figure this out on his own before the last ginger petal falls off the rose? My guess is that he won't.",1437436800,9,1239,4.344827586206897
6283531,4,B00IO5G5S4,"I LOVED IT!!
fantastic. My boyfriend and I are both super GINGERS, so we had a great time watching this!

I need to buy it again as the new sealed copy came scratched! (somehow!) and I had to return it.",1424217600,2,202,4.05
6283532,1,B00IO5G5S4,"If I could give this documentary less than one star I would. I understand what this guy was trying to do with this movie. I feel his pain...being ostracized for something you can't control, carrying a lot of pain because you wish you could be like everybody else hurts. Sounds like a great idea for a movie. Except that it wasn't. It was poorly executed, slow at times and I found myself looking at the clock wishing he would just grow a pair and get it together. Feeling sorry for yourself is not sexy and I think that is what made the ladies run for the hills, not his red hair.",1418428800,3,580,4.2342342342342345
6283533,5,B00IO5G5S4,Great movie!  The interviews with his elementary school teacher and the women who criticized 'gingers' were particularly captivating.  They showed how vicious people can be for no reason other than what someone looks like.  Watch this movie and be inspired.,1417392000,2,257,5.375
6283534,5,B00IO5G5S4,"I saw this at a screening with Scott Harris. Love, love, love it! Great message no matter what color your hair!",1401580800,,111,4.333333333333333
6283535,5,B00IO5G5S4,"Scott Harris does the most wonderful job of telling his story of being a redhead (which usually equates to being an outsider) with such pure honesty, humor, and yes sadness in this great film.  I highly recommend everyone watch it whether they are a redhead, know a redhead, have ever felt like an outsider, or ever PICKED on someone for being different. It's really a revelation for everyone.  Scott raised money via Kickstarter to make this film and I wish I could have contributed to that. I wrote to him and asked if he would do a followup movie and another Kickstarter to raise funds. He replied immediately and said he plans on it - so I fully plan to donate to that endeavor heavily! I rented this on iTunes, the purchased it and finally bought some copies on Amazon for friends and family. That's how great it is!

Scott has a great future as a filmmaker and we are lucky he shared his journey with us!",1398211200,,910,4.437125748502994
6283536,5,B00IO5G5S4,"I supported this on Kickstarter after seeing something about it on Reddit and was thoroughly impressed by the final outcome. It's an at-times heart-wrenching story about how people who are ""different"" are treated in our society. The film-maker deserves enormous kudos for his film-making, openness and honesty.

Scott Harris is a film-maker who also has a terrible disability; he's a redhead. At least you'd think it is a terrible disability from the way he was bullied as a kid and treated as an adult. Through documenting his search for a ginger-loving girlfriend, he somewhat inadvertently ends up revealing the wounds a lifetime of abuse about his hair colour has caused him.",1394409600,,679,5.117117117117117
6283537,5,B00IO5G5S4,"The documentary has the perfect blend of humor and serious commentary on life and love. Though told through the lens of one red head, the views and emotions are universal.  I screened the documentary with my weekly movie group and everyone loved it, which is rare with this group.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1394409600,,313,4.672727272727273
6283538,5,B00IO5G5S4,"I've seen this film already twice. It's a touching documentary not only about having red hair, but also about self-confidence and finding his place in life. I think everyone can find some aspects of his own life in this film.",1394409600,,225,4.65
6283539,4,B00IO5G5S4,"My hat goes off to Scott Harris for not only sharing his story but the tenacity to take the film on the road and find theaters for screenings. It's documentary narrative style takes the viewer on Scott's journey growing up in the United States, moving to Scotland, his search for love and includes his discoveries while participating in a large gathering of redheads in the Netherlands. This film deserves to be seen by anyone who likes some poignant moments with their laughter, and isn't just for redheads.",1394236800,,508,4.850574712643678
6283540,5,B00IO5G5S4,"I must admit that I have red hair but this movie would appeal to anyone who loves to watch an underdog blossom! Scott has this wonderful way of being really funny and touching at the same time. I laughed, I cried, and I watched the film three times!",1394236800,5,249,4.208333333333333
6283541,5,B00IO5G5S4,"You will be fascinated as the story unfolds and find yourself unexpectedly moved and uplifted at the same time.  Scott Harris is able to present a powerful message about growing up different, bullying and relationships in a wonderfully understated, humorous, unconventional approach.  I have watched it several times and enjoy it in a different way each time.",1394150400,2,359,5.280701754385965
6283542,5,B00IO5G5S4,"This is a great film for everyone. It is very funny, but is also very poignant  at times. It will make you laugh, think and at times wonder what the hell is wrong with some people. It is a worth while watch.",1394150400,,207,3.9285714285714284
6283543,5,B00IO5G5S4,"I really enjoyed this film and had a tough time at school in Australia being a very carrotty redhead. I wish I had seen something like this back then, it would have given me a sense of humour about it all. Some of the attacks are really quite ridiculous and say alot more about the people bullying than the victim, but it can be hard to see that at the time when it feels so personally hurtful. Who knew redheads get together in a large vibrant gathering to connect and celebrate their hair!! Loved this movie x",1394064000,,511,4.278350515463917
6283544,4,B00IO5G5S4,"What started as a grad school film project became a graduation project in the school of life.  Scott P. Harris is well worth watching and listening to!  I saw the film screened in Seattle in early 2014 and am buying a copy of the DVD to keep and share.  Not a slick professional film, but more importantly, it is deeply rich and real.  I recommend you buy this DVD.",1394064000,,365,4.246376811594203
6283545,5,B00IO5G5S4,"Don't let the title put you off if you're not a redhead. Everyone can relate to this universal story of rejection, creating negative stories about oneself, and searching for love. Ultimately it's the same answer for everyone, bullied or not - you have to love and accept yourself before anyone else can.

I also started to follow this project when Scott opened his kick-starter campaign. I am very proud that I could be one of the small group of producers of this documentary. It's not a slick multi-million dollar documentary but it tells a very real story in real-time. We get to journey with Scott in his quest to understand what it is that he is really looking for.",1394064000,5,669,4.621848739495798
6283546,5,B00IO5G5S4,"Scott Harris thought he was making a short, humorous film about his quest to find a woman who prefers men with red hair. But the result is a moving, feature-length documentary in which we witness him startled to be facing his own personal demons as the camera rolls. Personal, yes, but viewers of all stripes (and hair colors) will likely recognize their own demons as Harris confronts his, and is ultimately transformed. ""Being Ginger"" is a remarkable metafilm: before our eyes, Harris is making a film, but the film is also making him. Thought-provoking, entertaining, and highly recommended.",1394064000,6,594,5.071428571428571
6283547,4,B00IO5G5S4,"I started to follow this project when Scott P Harris opened his kick-starter campaign. I was one of the tiny producers of this documentary, and I'm very proud of it.

6283548,5,B00IO5G5S4,"This poignant, real, truthful movie about learning to change the negative stories we have about ourselves.  Being Ginger is more than about being a redhead in a world that teases you for it, it's about the effects of bullying and learning to love yourself.  This young director's movie made us laugh and cry. See this movie!",1394064000,2,324,4.767857142857143

8643819,5,B00IO5G5S4,"Excellent. I had no idea redheads experienced such discrimination and Im a black woman in America!!
That woman who he interviewed when when wearing the sign was particularly disturbing. What a c u next Tuesday ! Like she really said all that horrible stuff like there was no other possible way to view someone with red hair. I have no idea how he controlled himself to not insult her. It was really upsetting.
But I appreciate all that honesty, the childhood stuff. The lunch pass? Geez. And its accepted!? You can understand why such low self-esteem. Like wth.. at least with being black its particularly the norm to know being racist and ignorant is wrong.",1515974400,,658,4.730434782608696

8643824,3,B00IO5G5S4,"This film reminded me of how an enneagram four can behave (and since I am a four, I'm familiar with that type).  Such behaviors can include the following, and I mention them because I saw Scott behave in all these ways: a quiet charm, a droll self-deprecating sense of humor, an eye for detail and getting things right, a nearly all-consuming self-consciousness, exceptional sensitivity, excessive self-focus, a tendency to ruminate on painful experiences from the past (experiences which were legitimately wounding, but which are no longer present, and so need to be reconciled and released, so as to live in the present), taking one's self overly seriously, fear of rejection (which manifests as an anxiety that keeps one slightly distant from whomever one is trying to connect with), a palpable sense of being ""different"" in a way that construes being different as ""not desirable,"" a reluctance to stand up for one's self or challenge another--even humorously (which is how Scott behaved when interacting with the crass female spouting reams of ridiculousness about the unattractiveness of redheads), a tendency to be self-doubting and self-rejecting, and a natural motivation to express one's feelings in the hopes of having those feelings understood and validated (including making a documentary).

Scott, if you read this, I appreciated that with your film, you held up a mirror to me of how Four's can come across.  I appreciated it because it's always easier to see others than to see one's self.  For that significant reason alone, the documentary had value for me.

Beyond that (and you may find this hard to believe), I had never heard of a bias against redheads, and I certainly do not have such a bias myself.  I was really surprised to learn there was such a thing and I felt sad that children may be discriminated against because of it. When I heard about your early life, I found myself wishing that your parents, or perhaps some of your teachers, had laid heavy-duty ""ginger appreciation"" on you to counter-act any taunts.  That anyone would be biased against you because of your innate coloring is ludicrous.  It really doesn't matter that this is my viewpoint, however, if you don't also know that this is ludicrous.  I feel sad that you have somewhat bought into the ""ginger bias"" myth, when there is zero substance to it.  Moreover, when you get focused and very clear about your own all-encompassing value, that shining sense of  clarity will then become the primary feature that people pay attention to (except, of course, for occasional clods---but so what).

FYI, if you are unfamiliar with a personality type system called the enneagram, and you might like to learn a bit about it, I suggest going to the site of my favorite enneagram authors: The Enneagram Institute.  I went through quite a number of enneagram authors before I found these authors (Riso and Hudson), due to being confused by the big variations in how other writers described the enneagram.  However, Riso and Hudson  systematized the knowledge in a way that made it understandable.  Their site offers a free brief enneagram type test, should you care to look further into your type.  While I have resonated with some of your Four qualities here, it still remains that only you can decide what type you are (because the type is based on the inner life, and not on behaviors).

It was courageous of you to explore what may be a common bias, which has clearly affected you.  I am not sure how much you actually learned by doing this documentary, but at least you got your feet wet in facing this challenge (rather than squeamishly avoiding it).  I hope your explorations continue.

I also hope the effort gave you some needed objectivity, such as, for example, seeing the response of your former teacher (who said he'd make you into a pinata).  He still seems as dense as he was when you were in his care.  Thus, while his handling of the situation back then failed you, it wasn't personal to you.  Objectively speaking, his buffoonery was rather about him--100% about him (and ditto for all who are clueless and/or bullies).

That there can be so many clueless people in the world can be shocking to someone as sensitive as you seem to be (and as I am)---mainly because our innate sensitivities would not favor allowing us to behave like someone raised in a closet.  The ratio of such low awareness folks to the sensitive folks seems to be pretty high (something like 8 or 9 to 1, which I infer from the Myers-Briggs personality studies).  Consequently, any sensitive person (whether redhead or not) is sure to be stomped on, mowed down, and/or crushed by blunderers who stomp about the world smashing flowers under foot, unawares.  A prime example of such flower-crushing was the former teacher who to this day seems not to have grasped that he'd abandoned his supervisory mandate to protect the innate vulnerabilities of the seven-year-old's in his care.  He is to be pitied.

The good news, however, is that once it can be inwardly affirmed that dolts like the teacher, or like cruel children, do not actually see YOU, but are rather projecting inhumanity out of their low states of consciousness, then detaching from their crudeness can be easier.  I hope that is what happens to you, Scott, through your own efforts towards that end.  By taking firm hold of how you use your mind, you can get clear that all ""redhead bias shenanigans"" have zero to do with you.  Once you get really (REALLY) clear on this, you will cease letting that kind of feedback define you.  You have the power to define yourself, no matter how others may behave.  Consequently, if you make a follow-up documentary, I hope it is about your life-changing embrace of the enormous power of self-definition.",1460592000,,5773,4.844195519348268
8643825,3,B00IO5G5S4,"Eh.....you wanna root for this guy, but even though he claims to be insecure and low self esteem he's basically a douchebag. He laments being judged for his looks & his ginger hair his whole life but He is basically a 5 who won't settle for anything less than a Perfect 10. He judges every woman he meets for their looks.

8643827,5,B00IO5G5S4,"Just looking around and stopped on this one. I'm so glad I did! This is a wonderful film about coming to terms with who you are and asking yourself why. He looks into his past and questions his own thoughts and preconceived notions. He talks to the public about theirs and ultimately finds a group to belong to.
There is a part of the story on finding a girl which does involve physical attraction. Why would you want to date someone you weren't attracted to? But even in that search he is questioning his preconceived notions and not standing by an idea simply because he had it. He makes it obvious that he is looking for a real meaningful connection. I didn't find it judgmental or superficial or whiny or whatever. I found it to be honest and being honest about ourselves is not at all easy.",1455580800,,795,4.414965986394558
8643828,5,B00IO5G5S4,"I honestly had NO idea people were so mean to red heads in the U.S. or even Scotland...I don't understand it because in the country where I grew up this didn't happen [and my dad is a redhead :-)].I think red heads are beautiful because they are very rare and special and they are possibly slightly genetically more evolved than other white people. I find them very intelligent, witty and funny, as is Scott...he is very self-aware of his every thought.
I found it extremely disturbing that the teachers and even the principal did NOTHING to encourage acceptance at school...(if you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem) and that some teachers actually made it MUCH worse is unforgivable and inexcusable and have no business in being teachers in the first place...Scott handled the bullying much better than I would have had, I would have NEVER been able to process so much ""hate"", because at that age everything becomes TOO personal, obviously he is a much stronger person than I am.
(So what if Scott likes beautiful girls? Almost everyone likes beautiful people, don't they?!? And beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway...)The movie is NOT about finding beautiful girls or even about dating but it's a journey about coming full circle (for example when seeing how the children reacted to so much unwanted attention) and learning that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being a red head because they are beautiful and wonderful people and that if the world had a huge amount of red heads they wouldn't be outcasted at all I am sure. To me the movie is about loving oneself and others and about understanding how fundamentally important it is the way we treat others and the things we choose to say...so weigh your every word and picture yourself in the other person's shoes before saying anything at all...
(don't forget to teach your children to do the same, if you ever have any).

On a lighter note I found the movie very funny and entertaining and time flew while watching it, wish it had been longer! Thank you very much Scott & friends for shooting it and sharing it with us, whether they like you or not (if they don't, the problem obviously lies with them!).",1454630400,,2203,4.663239074550129
