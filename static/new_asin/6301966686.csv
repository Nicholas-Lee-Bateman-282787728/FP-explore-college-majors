7817701,5,6301966686,"I have seen this movie twice in Portland, OR. The language was spoken in Dutch, but the subtitles were in English. As I lived through that war and remember the liberation of my hometown by American soldiers, this movie hit me hard.  The second time I saw it, was with my children.  At the end of it, I put my head on the back of the seat in front of me and sobbed.  My kids did not know what to say or do.  I have tried to buy this film, on a DVD, as I saw it in the theatre in Portland.  Dutch spoken, English subtitles.  Not to be had.  The same for the film, ""Anna's Line.""  I think, it too, won the Oscar for best foreign film.  As did ""Karakter.""  But I cannot find those movies on DVD with the English subtitles, anywhere.  Why?  Can someone at Amazon explain this to me?  Please?",1437868800,,786,4.025974025974026

7817703,5,6301966686,"The Assault (De aanslag) (1986) is one of the best films ever made.  It was the winner of an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1987.  But it is one of the gems that has fallen into cinema obscurity -- at least in the U.S.  Part of the reason is the combination of poor English dubbing and bad editing in coming up with a version of the film that is more ""Americanized"".  Counting on the intolerance of U.S. audiences for movies over 2 hours long and with subtitles, studio executives came up with a truncated version that cut out some of the richest parts of the movie presented in dubbed English that didn't fit the movie well at all.

This is one of the best treatments of the way that traumatic events linger and re-emerge over a lifetime despite the efforts to put them away in the past and move forward with life.  It focuses on the life of one individual who experienced a deeply traumatic event during the Nazi-occupation of The Netherlands in World War II.  The story is an intricate one with different threads of the story woven through time, like a mystery that unfolds as new discoveries are made.  It is also an excellent study of the way the mind is unconsciously drawn to memories and feelings that are linked to the traumatic event.  One example is a brief but deeply poignant experience of love in the midst of great loss and the way it recurs insistently in later life not just as a memory but a driving force in the protagonist's life.  Unfortunately, the dubbed and chopped VHS version of this movie does such a hatchet job on this one aspect of the movie that it leaves anyone who had previously seen the full movie with subtitles feeling ripped off and ... well, assaulted.

If you can get a chance to see the entire unedited and undubbed, subtitled version of this movie, go for it.  If you happen to see the dubbed, edited version, you are likely to appreciate a tremendous amount of what is there, but keep in mind that you are also missing a lot including some of the emotionally most central material.

Hopefully, there will be enough interest to get a new full edition with subtitles rather than dubbing released on DVD and Blu-ray.",1382140800,,2173,4.4987277353689565
7817704,2,6301966686,"The dubbing was done badly in the UK, sounded like they had 2 or 3 readers multi-tasking. Sad fate for a fantastic movie. Make sure your purchase is subtitled and unedited.",1291680000,,172,4.580645161290323
7817705,5,6301966686,"Halfway through viewing The Assault in a theater I realized it was one of the best movies I had ever seen.  A couple of years later it became the first VHS cassette I purchased.  What a disappointment!  Not only, as other reviewers have noted, is the VHS version dubbed, but 23 minutes have been cut out of it!  The film is supposed to run 149 minutes, not 126.  Curses to MGM/UA Home Video, who presumably were so cheap they cut the film so it would fit onto one tape.

5 stars to the film version.
4 stars to the book.
3 stars to the VHS version.",1261526400,4,548,4.122641509433962
7817706,4,6301966686,"THE ASSAULT is one of those movies that one hears about, makes a mental note to check out sometime and then promptly forgets.  If there hadn't been a VHS copy of this Oscar winning film available in my local library, I doubt that I ever would have otherwise stumbled across it.  So far, it is not available on DVD. Nor is the original Dutch language film available in any format in this country.

And yes, I like to think that those of us who are ""subtitle snobs"" at least have a point.  There's something about hearing the actual language (even when you don't happen to speak it) that gives a viewer a feel for the setting, the culture and the true nature of the dramatis personae.  Or maybe it's just that in this particular case, the dubbed in English voices seem all wrong.  I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't actually use the original Dutch actors (many of whom would likely be fairly fluent in English), but that is hardly any guarantee that the dubbed version is going to work.

In the case of THE ASSAULT, one often gets the feeling that the actors providing the spoken language are hamming it up, while those handling the body language may be underplaying it.  The effect is jarring.

At other moments, the English language version just doesn't make sense.  When our grown up hero meets the woman who is to become his first wife in London, there are only a few words exchanged.  The scene barely makes sense spoken in English in an English speaking city.  Until, that is, you pull back and realize that the young woman, who overheard our hero muttering something to himself in Dutch, apparently responded in that language, thereby signalling herself to be a countrywoman--as well as being an attractive young woman almost any handsome young heterosexual man would flirt with.

I suspect that many English speaking viewers will find this film a bit sketchy at moments.  The story of the lifetime effects of the trauma experienced by a young boy in occupied Holland certainly needs to be compressed, but it also needs to be paced effectively.  My sense was that the filmmakers could have done a much better job on that score.  The movie hints at the damage done to the young 12 year old Anton, but we could use a little more exploration of his psyche.

That's difficult in film, and it is likely that the Harry Mulisch novel that inspired the movie does a more thorough job.  The film version made me want to read the book--for a better understanding of Anton's character--but shouldn't a movie work on its own terms?

But then again, maybe the original film did.  I got the feeling, watching this, that I was only seeing half a movie.  I could only begin to guess how THE ASSAULT might affect Dutch viewers of the original.  The cinematography was quite striking, the music effective--and the storyline has a certain inherent fascination.  So maybe the fault is in the dubbing.

One thing the movie does very well is its portrayal of all its characters as ""victims of history.""  We see how the War and the post-War tensions have shaped the lives of millions.  Yes, human beings--especially children--are often remarkably resilient in the face of such devastation.  But the scars are there too, for anyone who cares to look for them.

THE ASSAULT, whatever its flaws, is well worth seeing.  Should the Dutch version ever become available on the US market, I would welcome the chance to finally see that version.  I suspect it works a lot better.",1125705600,9,3456,4.664462809917356
7817707,5,6301966686,this movie shows to us all what relative small impact during the years growing up might have on our being adult whow what a powerful movie,1075334400,,138,4.346153846153846
7817708,5,6301966686,"I echo the strongly positive reviews of others on this thought-provoking and powerful Dutch film starring Derek De Lint (""Soldier of Orange,"" ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"").  It thoroughly deserves the Academy Award it received in 1987 as Best Foreign Language Film.
My only concerns are that this fine film is only available in the US in a dubbed version and on VHS.  Why -- since it won an Oscar as best foreign language film -- is it not available in the US in the original Dutch with English subtitles?  And why -- since it has already been released on DVD in the Netherlands (Region 2/ Dutch only sound track/ Dutch only subtitles), is it not yet available here on DVD?
One can only hope that an eventual US (Region 1 - NTSC) release on DVD will be forthcoming -- in multiple languages (Dutch/Eng/Fr/Sp/Port please), AND multiple subtitles (Dutch/Eng/Fr/Sp/Port).  As a well-deserved Oscar winner, the film should be made accessible to as wide an audience as possible.
In short, a compelling film that, along with ""Soldier of Orange"" gives real insight life in the Netherlands under German occupation in World War II.",1067299200,21,1128,4.859375
7817709,5,6301966686,"In case you couldn't tell, I absolutely loved this movie. In fact, I watched it like 12 times in a row. It was the first Dutch film ever to win an Academy Award for best Foreign Film.
It's basically a story of the effects of trauma onthe human mind. At first it's set in Nazi-occupied Holland in 1945, but the movie basically deals with the entire life of one boy, Anton Steenwijk. In 1945 his family was murdered, and not surprisingly, it affects everything in his life afterwards.
This movie is full of extremely talented actors, namely Derek de Lint who plays Anton as an adult. To really understand this movie, you have to pay attention to details, because it's got an intricate plot. But it's a wonderful and touching story.
I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, no matter what their interests, because it is such a beautiful film.  END",889660800,18,836,4.573333333333333
