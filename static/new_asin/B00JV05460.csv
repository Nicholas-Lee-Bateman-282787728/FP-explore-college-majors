6391623,2,B00JV05460,"Finally the US release of the more maligned anime series out there, depending on your point of view this can be either a good thing or a bad thing.  I won't rehash the summary of the show as this series has been review and analyzed to death online and I doubt I could add that much to the discussion.

I will say this show has strong points depending on your predispositions going into it, if you want a traditional romantic anime look elsewhere, if you want a sunshine and roses resolution look elsewhere, but if you want a show where they attempt to have a more realistic outcome to fantasy scenarios then this may be you show, keep in mind that the outcomes of nearly everything in the show aim for the absurdly extreme where as a more start at grey end at grey in the moral spectrum would have been better.

Animation and sound design wise the show is nothing too special, some shortcuts in the animation relatively par for the course character designs and motion.  Sound is relatively normal too but the OP song will get stuck in your head if for no other reason than to always remind you that you actually saw School Days.

Is it worth owning, yes if for no other reason to satisfy morbid curiosity and because it really is not as evil and terrible as the internet tries to portray.  However, it is not good and don't go into it thinking you will find some diamond in the rough, but you can still have a good time watching the soap opera-esque train wreck slowly plow into the station.

One more thing, and I usually don't do this, but to adults/parents I would say keep this one for kids 16+ some of the scenarios and outcomes in this show are better left to an older crowd.",1405814400,8,1681,4.3514376996805115

That would definitely make it a complete series for sure. I would have given this review a 4.5 because of it, but I will leave it at all 5 stars!",1404691200,3,440,4.301204819277109
6391626,1,B00JV05460,"This anime seems to get a lot of praise by people who seemingly don't watch much good anime, I'm all for varying opinions but anyone who can call this show 'good' is insane.
The story revolves around the 'bad end' route of the original School Days Visual Novel, a route that can only be achieved if the player makes Makoto (The protagonist) the biggest cheating, male-chauvinistic moron I have ever witnessed in the anime medium. So what do they do? Well, in just 12 episodes, our main character gets the girl of his dreams, decides its too tiring to be with her, cheats on her with the girl who set the two of them up and then continues to cheat/ have sex with around 7 or 8 other girls to the point where his cheating becomes episodic. The motivations the girls have for sleeping with our main character are just as stupid as the show; with reasons varying from ""Because I'm a slut"" to ""Because I want you to be faithful to my best friend"".

The reason this show is universally hated by 99% of anime fans is because the personalities of ALL the characters  are less interesting than the personality of my Body Pillow, giving off the idea that the only reason so many girls were forced into the series was so Makoto would have more people to sleep with as none of them except the two main girls have any kind of depth to their personality.
And then there's the ending, and no, I will not give spoilers encase any of you are dumb enough to waste your hard-earned money on this hell-spawn of a show, but all I will say is that the ending is just as ridiculous as the rest of the show, with characters literally turning INSANE -in the same vein as Higurashi's main cast- after they find out that Makoto has cheated on hem despite the fact that they were probably in a relationship for the best part of 3 days.

The animation is pretty good, but if you're only interested in the animation of this show then I'd much rather recommend High School DXD which was made and animated by the same company. The music score had nothing remotely memorable and even as I write this I struggle to even hum the tune of the opening or ending song.

Overall, out of the 600+ shows I have watched, this is up there with one of the worst anime I have ever seen, heck even hentai shows at least have some kind of audience to cater to, but this doesn't, there's nothing remotely interesting about this show except perhaps the nonsensical ending, which if you REALLY want to watch, just look it up on YouTube and save yourself the pain. Avoid this anime like the plague and spend your money on another cheap-ish anime DVD like the re-release of Eureka Seven or, if you REALLY want a more serious harem anime, I'd point you towards something like the fun but action-packed Date A Live.",1404172800,11,2760,4.405882352941177

6391629,5,B00JV05460,"Oh look, another show with one loser guy getting girls throwing their panties at him? NOPE.

This show is based off of the wonderful School Days visual novel that is on PC. It faithfully adapts the ""worst end"" route of the game into a 12-episode series. Due to this, the characters are portrayed how they would be in that route of the visual novel. It is worth noting that the visual novel only has 4 bad endings out of a possible 20 or so. Why they went with the *worst* ending is beyond me but I'm glad they did, as it was the biggest breath of fresh air and one of the best deconstructions of the harem/romance genre to hit anime in years.

Without giving many spoilers, the protagonist, Makoto, follows the typical harem plot: Guy has crush on girl, suddenly GIRLS EVERYWHERE want him. Where this show deviates is how those interactions affect everyone. In most shows the protagonist just inadvertently fondles the breast of whoever he wants and no one bats an eye, even his harem. In School Days, the girls get deeply hurt by Makoto's harem action instead of the nonsensical, cartoony stuff you'd find in something like Love Hina. There's a consequence for his actions. This is what sets it apart and makes it great. If you're sick of the obnoxious harem plots with loser protagonists getting the hottest women on the planet after him while he dates them all with no consequence, School Days is what you're looking for.",1401667200,31,1424,4.602362204724409

6391633,5,B00JV05460,":May contain some spoilers:

Well... that was some type of rare anime I have seen, now this anime begins with of course boy falls in love with girl, and the girl is all shy and scared cause she never had a boyfriend before. So then Sekai comes into the picture and helps out Makoto, well it's obvious that she already loves him. Right?! But, if a boy is trying to get the girl he likes trying to be his girlfriend, I wouldn't want any help from a girl. Cause it could end with the boy cheating on both of them. So then, Makoto wanted to do the stuff that he wanted to do to Kotonoha, well she didn't like it, and didn't accept it. Then a day later at school Sekai realizes that something is wrong with him and talks to him, and he yells at her, ""SHUT UP"" then she takes him out into the hallway, and talks to him about what happened, and she says, I will give you special training, and that's when things are gonna get all jacted up. Later, Sekai and Makoto did the training and somehow, Makoto liked it, no surprise tho . Then, Makoto suddenly became more interested in her, well for once he never loved her, he only loved her because he got to do the stuff that he liked to do to her. Same as the other girls, he mostly just wanted to have sex with all of them. : PLAYER ALERT: XD  So, finally he broke up with Kotonoha, then I guess she became a complete psychopath. And was lifeless and soulless. And all she thought about was revenge. Then just one day, Sekai finally came to school, and told him she was pregnant, and that's when he wanted nothing to do with her, becuz she was pregnant. And sadly the whole school found out. And all the girls started avoiding him. And still didn't care about Sekai nor Kotonoha, which this guy is a, a-hole. So then, well Kotonoha and Makoto ended up dating eachother again I guess, when we all know he doesn't love her, it's just because none of the other girls wanna be around him, so the only two ppl are Sekai and Kotonoha, which mostly like I said, he wants nothing at all to deal with Sekai anymore. Later, Sekai becomes psychopath to, and well we all know what she does, don't wanna spoil it though. So this message tells the message, not to cheat of your girlfriend. Ok boys, and all of y'all that read this message try to spread it out to every boy you know and tell them to watch this. Cuz this anime actually happens in real life, if y'all don't know it. Boys cheat on their girlfriend with other girls. Or same as girls. So I highly recommend this anime to everybody. Mostly boys tho :p  So, enjoy. :D",1457913600,,2554,4.21881390593047
6391634,4,B00JV05460,"I cannot review the actual physical DVD itself as I didn't get my copy from Amazon, but I can review the anime.

School Days the anime series is a harem-type anime based off of the visual novel of the same name. Although it is a harem, it's very different from other harem anime you may have seen. Our protagonist, Makoto Itou, isn't like many harem male leads. You know, the ones who are basically completely devoid of any personality and might as well just be a sheet of paper for the viewer to draw themselves on. He's his own person, and though many of the choices he makes can be fairly disgusting, it's definitely a breath of fresh air.

However, I will say that the anime is much less enjoyable than the visual novel.

In the visual novel, many of the routes you can take honestly show Makoto to be a fairly nice guy. He doesn't have to cheat, he doesn't have to a dick, and although some of the routes make him out to be bad, you still can't really say an average person wouldn't react in the same way.
In the anime, however, I have no idea who would act like he does though. Not to spoil anything, but it quickly goes from simply being a love triangle to being a love decagon at the very least. At one point he actually leaves one of the characters simply to find other women to have sex with.

Not that any of this makes it a bad anime, but while the visual novel could be fairly relatable to most people, the anime simply makes you despise the actions of many of the characters.

Also: The anime skipped all of the H scenes, but there's still many, many shots looking up skirts, zooming in on breasts, and even some nudity.",1457049600,,1634,4.275080906148867

Try not to think to much about them.  Anyway heard about this anime though only the subtitles are in English the rest is in Japanese for voice.  Is based on a dating sim game where your main male character like the one in this series is dating high school girls and if you pick certain choices your girlfriend goes crazy and I mean crazy as in murder spree.  Also is said to have the one of the most brutal death scenes ever as described in Watchmojo.com's Most Brutal Anime Death scenes.  Just check that out.,1447286400,2,671,4.467213114754099
6391637,4,B00JV05460,"School Days may be the most controversial anime in existence. Some people hate it, and some love it; barely anyone falls into the middle. I, for one, adore School Days. It is very successful in making you feel certain emotions for the main character (I don't want to spoil anything), and it puts a very unique twist on the tired harem genre. Even if you know you're going to hate this show, you have to watch it; this anime needs to be seen.
This review will focus more on the packaging and bonus features. To start with, there are barely any to speak of. The only extra feature is the Magical Heart Kokoro-chan OVA. That's all. No textless openings or endings, no Valentine's Day OVA, heck, not even any advertising for Discotek's other releases. There was a HUGE opportunity missed here, because they could have included the featurette that was broadcast in place of the final episode in Japan upon its first release (Nice Boat). They make reference to this on the back cover, but nothing comes of it. Also, the packaging itself is just... Meh. The bootleg release (which you should NOT buy) of this has prettier packaging. The slipcover itself is slightly different than the product's picture on the front (it says ""Complete TV Series"" instead of ""Complete Collection""). Inside of the black case is a white plastic page (I don't know why they did this) that holds one of the discs, and there isn't a paper insert inside.
Overall, if you like School Days, buy this. If you're curious about it, go watch it on Crunchyroll for FREE! I look forward to also getting the visual novel to experience everything this story has to offer.",1437609600,3,1630,4.663194444444445

Watching this a second time, I'm in awe of how much I sincerely like School Days.  It's different.  It's unique.  It's captivating.  It's moving.

It's not perfect at all.  A few plot elements are used strictly to add melodrama, and the ending is slightly more radical than realistic.  Nonetheless, it's a refreshing, candid, subtle, and relatable show that poignantly demonstrates what ""NOT"" to do during your teenage years, haha!

School Days is truly the very definition of a Love It/Hate It split among anyone who's seen it.

No one watches School Days and says, ""Well, it was alright, I guess."" Nah, it's more along the lines of ""F*** THIS TRASH HOW CAN ANYONE LIKE THIS"" or going on a forum and asking ""Is there anything else like this?"" I'm of the latter group, and to my knowledge, there really isn't anything like it, or at least as competent at what it sets out to do.

Here's what you really need to know: The very innocently- and blandly-titled School Days is a deconstruction of the harem romance genre. It starts out as a generic ""guy wants girl, guy finds other girls in the process who all want him"" sort of thing. Usually these things end with the male protagonist picking one girl for whatever reason, they hook up for good, and the clear message is that everything's going to be all right.

School Days doesn't give half a damn about accomplishing anything of that sort. It's out to do the exact opposite. It's also prepared to demonstrate to you how stupid harem romance comedies can be by showing you one...possible outcome if that sort of thing starts to happen.

Its characters are designed to be more than just unlikable. They're meant to be covertly *loathsome*. That is, it's not immediately clear that anyone's a bad person in this show. Then you get to know a few of them in ways you may wish you hadn't, and the more the series progresses, the more it's demonstrated how secretly damaged and destructive many of them are capable of being.

Part of what separates School Days from pretty much everything else is that everyone in this story (including many minor characters) wholeheartedly believes they're the protagonist. And if you think about it from their point of view, they very well could convince you they truly are. Not one character believes themselves to be malicious at all, and that their actions are justified, given how far they've been pushed and the circumstances in which they've been placed. Everyone has a goal in mind, and their goal is genuinely a noble one.

But not everyone can get their happy ending when what's needed for one character's happy ending is also needed by another character for *their* happy ending. They can't all be the main character--the protagonist--and they can't all have their happy ending typically reserved for the protagonist, even if they just want it so badly, it hurts, and it breaks their hearts that they aren't given special treatment. Everyone really does have good intentions and they sincerely do want a happily-ever-after ending without anyone being hurt, but when those goals are threatened, they push their own morals a little. And then, when that doesn't work, they push them a little more. And then a little more. For some characters, their internal struggle with cognitive dissonance is traumatizing in itself. And every self-believed protagonist is willing to go to any length to get their ""good ending"".

That said, this is part tragedy, part horror by the end of its 12 episodes, with an infamously brutal end that, with downright admirable aesthetic precision, is truly horrifying. It can be downright painful to watch, yet is also compelling in the same way, much like being unable to tear your eyes away from footage of blank-eyed survivors in communities after natural disasters.

It sets out to basically trap the unknowing viewer into a false sense of security, then in its second half, does the sadistic equivalent of taking a child's doll away, then pulling off its limbs in front of them, before tossing them all back in a heap, then saying, ""What did you learn?""

And while opinions differ, I consider it *unrivaled* in the premise it creates and executes. I can't overstate this: If you like watching horror-tragedy anime in a realistic school setting, this is the Gold Standard for it.
