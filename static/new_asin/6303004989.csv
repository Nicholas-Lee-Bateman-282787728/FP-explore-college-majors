561493,4,6303004989,"RUMPELSTILTSKIN was the very first installment of the Cannon MovieTales series in 1987.  These great, family-friendly musicals have become quite popular and beloved over the years, and have now found their way to DVD.

""A promise made is a promise kept"": that's the moral of this delightful fairytale which tells the story of Katie (Amy Irving), the beautiful miller's daughter who, according to her tale-telling father, can spin straw into gold.  Of course, she cannot perform this task, but the greedy King Mezzer (Clive Revill), so taken with the concept of more wealth, demands that Katie spins the straw into strands of gold...or she will die.  In the attic of the castle, Katie is visited by a strange little man, who offers to spin the gold...but for a price.

Amy Irving shines with a delicate performance; and reveals a lilting singing voice with such musical numbers as ""Queen of the Castle"", ""I Need a Miracle"", and ""One Little Name"".  This film was very much a family affair for the Irving clan, because Amy's brother David Irving was the director, with their mother Priscilla Pointer as Queen Grizelda.

Clive Revill also turns in a suitably-hammy performance as the King; and Billy Barty commands with his wonderful turn in the title role.  Yael Uziely is also very effective as the mute ladies' maid.  John Moulder-Brown plays Prince Henry.

This was the premiere installment of the Cannon MovieTales series (which were filmed, very economically, back-to-back on location in Israel); however the subsequent titles all went straight to video.

A fantastic family musical at a price that's bound to please--and be sure to seek out the other Cannon MovieTales titles!

561494,5,6303004989,i really enjoyed this cannon movie tale. Like all the cannon movie tales exept red riding hood sticks to the origional story. Amy irving has such a pretty voice. You may recognise her from carrie and the sequel. This was the first of the 9 movies in the series. It was in theatres and it flopped even though i can't see why it did. After that the movies went str8 to vhs. I love the songs. My favorite is the one amy irving sings while she's trying to think of the name of the elf. I highly reccomend this whole series to anyone of any age who like me loves fairy tales. I'm so happy that i now own  all the movies in the series,1170979200,2,628,4.024
561495,3,6303004989,"Worth watching if only for the one song ""One Little Name"" sung by Amy Irving. All the songs are pleasant within this musical. Enjoyable.

A bragging miller gets his daughter in a jam. She must spin straw into gold for a greedy king. She makes a bargain with a ""bad"" elf. When she becomes princess, she must guess the elf's name or give him her baby.

""Hansel and Gretel"" by the same studio is good too, with a witch with a lot of personality, probably doing a lot of ad-libbing.

I suggest how they could have written a better script under the ""comment button"" below.",1170547200,,567,4.380952380952381

561499,5,6303004989,"Rumpelstiltskin was released in 1987 and starred Billy Barty as Rumpelstiltskin and Amy Irving as Katie, the miller's daughter.  It's the well-known tale from Grimms expanded and made into a musical.

Here's the movie's description available from Sony Pictures: ""Happily ever after has never been so golden! Amy Irving (Tuck Everlasting) stars as a miller's daughter who must learn magic from a troll to perform a miracle in this dazzling musical adaptation of the beloved Brothers Grimm fairy tale. Billy Barty (Willow), the ""dean of the screen's little people"" (Los Angeles Times), co-stars as the mischievous troll whose name is the kingdom's best-kept secret! After Katie's (Irving) father boasts to the king that she can turn grain into gold, she finds herself thrown in a dungeon with orders to spin straw into gold...or else! A crafty troll (Barty) agrees to help her perform the seemingly impossible feat - and land the king's handsome son - but his assistance comes at a price. Unless she can figure out his unusual name, she must hand over her firstborn child!""

The Cannon Movie Tale series of nine films has become nearly as popular among fairy tale enthusiasts and family film fans as Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre. Some would argue that this series is even more popular.  Either way, these musicals are suitable for the entire family and feature well-known actors from the 1980s.",1117929600,21,1400,5.0476190476190474
561500,2,6303004989,"I bought this movie for a pretty steep price for a used video, mainly because I remember my parents taking me to see it when I was 7 years old. Now that I have seen this movie again, I realize that it is actually a very SUPERFICIAL and unusually disturbing story. First of all the film openly praises GREED over and over again. There is a whole song and dance number about the King's love for money and how he loves the fact that he is ""greedy, greedy, greedy..etc..etc."" Even more disturbing about this is the fact that the greed issue never really has any resolution. You would think they would end up stating the consequences of being a greedy idiot, but they never really do, and the King and his snobbish Queen never end up getting what they truly deserve. Also, The prince is weird and treats Amy Irving's character as if she were just an object of bragging rights. Although the actor puts on several unimpressive facial expressions when his parents demand Katie to continuously spin straw into gold. A REAL Prince would have come to the defense of the airheaded Katie and whisked her off so that she didn't have to end up selling her first born child to a troll. By the way, What did Rumplestiltskin do that was so wrong? So what if the guy wanted a baby? He made a legally binding agreement with Katie and she should have stuck to it. Instead, with her newfound Princess status she seeks to destroy him and once again sneak her way out of a bad situation. Overall, I ended up feeling rather sad for Rumplestiltskin and think he should have gotten to keep the baby. Katie had a responsibility to that troll and she should have kept it! In fact, I would have rather seen the KING sucked into a firey pit in the floor than Rumplestiltskin. The movie conveys a few negative moral dillemas that pretty much could give kids the wrong impressions. First, GREED IS GOOD! Money is everything and you should DEFINETLY put it before human lives. Second, Lying is just fine and dandy, especially if it is to your own benefit and you can possibly attain ROYALTY status. And Finally, Shirking responsibilities and weaseling your way out of promises is ALWAYS a good idea if you change your mind. The characters are all unlikeable and the singing SUCKS! This is not a movie I would reccomend for kids to watch and hopefully it didn't effect my seven year old brain too much when I first saw it back in the 80's.",1105747200,9,2404,4.478359908883827
561501,4,6303004989,"Musicaly fairy tales.  What more could a kid ask for.  One of the classic and coveted Cannon Movie Tales series, although admitedly not one of their best (The Frog Prince and Sleeping Beauty are arguably better), still a member of something amazing.  A bit of a twist on the old tale that succedes in bringing the characters to life, as many revisions of fairy tales often try but fall short of doing.  Throw in a dash of sweet, catchy tunes that kids likely will be humming in those small quiet moments, even 10 years from now, when they've techinically ""outgrown"" childhood loves.  As a child this movie was one of my most treasured possesion, and still holds a deep and beautiful place in my heart.  For a 5-12 year old kid, especially one that likes fairy tales, this is an unmissable, everlasting treasure.  Better even than the fairie tale theatre creations.

561659,3,6303004989,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

Why did they make this a musical, and why did they give Billy Barty those continuous rhymes?  The former saps the story of rhythmn(ironically), and the latter robs Mr. Barty of a sense of suspense and ill foreboding that his character needs.  Amy Irving fares a little better as Katie but still seems uneven.

The Cannon Movie Tales version of ""Rumpelstiltskin"" is uneven; jokey where it should be serious, and serious where a lighter tone could have been beneficial.  Also starring Clive Revill and John Moulder-Brown, its screenplay makes Moulder-Brown a lackluster prince, but turns the great Revill into a greedily warped king.  Mr. Revill is a huge scene stealer in the uncharacteristically solid song ""I'm Greedy.""

It is fun to see Billy Barty as Rumpelstiltskin, and he and Amy Irving form possibly the biggest star combination to play the archetypal duo.  However, the movie around them, despite also boasting a great production design, lacks a crucial degree of overall spark.",1269820800,,1003,5.110429447852761

561664,4,6303004989,"""I Need A Miracle"", sings the beautiful miller's daughter Katie (Amy Irving)-- and she needs that miracle quickly!
Because of her father's foolish boasts, she must spin straw into gold, or die! Enter Billy Barty as the mischievious title character/elf who seizes the opportunity to exploit Katie's plight for his own ends.
  ""RUMPELSTILITSKIN"" was the first of the popular Cannon Movie Tales series of live-action fairy tale films.
Directed and written by David Irving from the Brothers Grimm story , this film is very much a family affair. David directs his mother Priscilla Pointer and sister Amy. Priscilla Pointer plays Queen Grizelda, who seemed very evil to me. Grizelda would sooner see Katie killed than have her son Prince Henry (John Moulder- Brown) marry the poor girl. Clive Revill is the ridiculously pompous and greedy King Mezzer.
 It is wonderful to see Amy Irving (""CARRIE"", ""YENTL"", ""CROSSING DELANCY"") in a starring role that gives her so much screen time. It is also nice to have Billy Barty as the title elf, who really is not as generous as he seems. He really wants to steal someone and use them as a slave and cook so he can have fun all day. As King Meezer's greed increases, the price of the elf's help grows higher and higher. He always speaks in rhymes and alternately giggles and screams as he works his magic. Rumpelstiltskin is a very spooky and scary little elf, indeed.
  The songs by Max Robert, including ""Straw Into Gold,"" ""I Need A Miracle"", ""I'm Greedy,"" and ""One Little Name,"" are serviceable to the plot but not particularly memorable. I wish the character of Prince Henry had been more developed in the screenplay. John Moulder-Brown has very little to do except hang around and hope Katie won't be killed by his father and mother so that he can marry her. Katie receives invaluable assistance from a talking raven and a supposedly mute servant girl named Emily.  Henry should have been a more active  Prince and participant on her behalf.",1186444800,3,1980,4.823008849557522
