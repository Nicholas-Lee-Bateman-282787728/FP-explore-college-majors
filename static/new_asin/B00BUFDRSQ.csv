5675705,5,B00BUFDRSQ,"This is another winner from Karen Voight.  This is a 45 minute routine that has four discrete routines: abs for a warm-up, lower body stretch, upper body stretch, and hip and buttocks.  You can do just one or, as I would recommend, all four in sequence.

Accessibility:  Excellent.  The cueing is perfect and clear as it always is in a Voight workout.  The moves are not complex.  The stretches are deep but modifications are clearly stated and she uses blocks to assist so that you do not have to go too deep and risk injury.  There is no impact and no significant heart rate elevation, so it is accessible for all levels.

Portability:  Very good.  The workout is very portable as it requires little to no equipment; the most you will need are two yoga blocks and you could substitute books if you need to.

Production Values:  Very Good.  The set is very soothing and beautiful and the camera work is well done.  The music is forgettable, but that is less important to me in this kind of workout.

Effectiveness:  Excellent.  I felt so great after this session.  I don't want to call it a ""workout"" since it is more of a spa session.  Perfect way to start the day!

While I understand that most people who are active want Insanity or P90X or something that will ""whip them into shape"", it is important to strike that balance between strength and stretch.  If you only concentrate on strength, it is much harder to increase speed and/or mobilty and injuries become a concern.  I strongly recommend this for less active people who are looking for a restorative workout and for the very active who need to find that critical balance.

Enjoy!",1375833600,28,1641,4.5793103448275865
5675706,4,B00BUFDRSQ,"This is and excellent workout if you are tight through the hips and need to loosen up more.  I've liked Karen Voight workouts, and this exercise set complements her Yoga Sculpt video very well.",1370822400,5,193,4.676470588235294
5675707,5,B00BUFDRSQ,"After this DVD you will feel like you've had an all-over body massage. Karen is almost ten years older than me, looks fantastic (always has) and explains clearly, with good humor, where you should be feeling the stretch, how to deepen or modify the moves, and is a soothing presence. I have many of her other DVDs. The ones that I've gotten to are always tougher than they look and I feel it the next day, especially if I haven't worked out for a while. This DVD is no exception. You do get your abdominal muscles worked gently. There are some yoga style and Pilates style moves mixed in with more purely athletic stretches. There is a good range.

The DVD is divided up into chapters, so if you want to focus on your shoulders, neck and upper back, you can. Or if it's your hips that need loosening and opening up, you can choose to do just that section. OR you can choose to do the entire DVD, of course!

It's only Karen on a platform in the middle of some gorgeous scenery. (I can only hope the mosquitoes weren't horrible during filming!)  There are no distractions, either visual or auditory. Just you, Karen on the DVD, and the outdoors. I love it.",1368576000,31,1155,4.38785046728972
5675708,4,B00BUFDRSQ,I enjoyed this video. I am used to a more vigorous yoga workout with the previous Karen Voight videos I have purchased. I felt very good after doing this video but if you want more of a workout then this won't do it. I use this as merely a supplement a couple days a week to my running and cross training workouts.,1368403200,3,314,4.080645161290323
5675709,5,B00BUFDRSQ,"Karen Voight has a history with producing high-quality exercise programs and she's done it again.  I enjoy the easy to follow instructions and  the fact that we don't need a lot of extra equipment.  Thanks again, Karen, for a great product!",1429056000,,240,4.804878048780488
5675710,4,B00BUFDRSQ,good for beginners. you will want to get others to switch it up!,1427328000,,64,4.0
5675711,5,B00BUFDRSQ,"I'm 44 and new to yoga. I have several of Karen Voight's DVD's and have been doing one each morning (about 45 minutes) for the past few months. I'm feeling my body transform and it is wonderful. I've always been active (maybe too much, part of the problem) and over the past few years I have been becoming more and more limited by injuries, aches, and pains. These dvd's are helping me enormously. I'm regaining strength, flexibility, physical awareness, etc., and it is feeling great. I'm enjoying being in my body again, which gives me an improved overall general sense of well being, and it's been a result of working daily with these dvd's.",1414108800,7,644,4.657894736842105
5675712,4,B00BUFDRSQ,"You are supposed to have 2 yoga blocks to do this video. I've tried to make do with pillows and a little stool around the house, but it really is best to have the blocks.

After having a recent attack of lower back spasming which literally had me laid out, I am recovering and trying to strengthen my core and also keep my muscles loose so that they won't pull on my back. Many of the exercises in the video do seem rather advanced, but for some of them she gives you an option to start in a more basic way. I can already see a difference in flexibility after doing the video for about 2 1/2 weeks, but still have MUCH room for improvement.

The video has 4 sections:
- Core work
- Upper Body
- Lower Body
- Hips and Buttocks

I really enjoy the natural setting and would recommend this DVD to a friend.  I hate exercising and actually feel like the 45 minutes go by relatively quicker than expected.",1406937600,7,900,4.184971098265896
5675713,3,B00BUFDRSQ,"I have this DVD and Karen's Full Body Stretch. This one is OK, but I prefer the Full Body Stretch. At times, Karen moves through the stretches too quickly in this DVD, in my opinion. At some points, the music is cheesy. I have very tight hamstrings and I was hoping this DVD would help, but the ""lower body"" section is not very helpful for me.",1406073600,12,343,4.212121212121212
5675714,5,B00BUFDRSQ,"Okay, good video. A I friend and I do it 3 days a week.

Cons: My friend and I wonder who this video is made for. It's got extensive use (and good cuing ) of blocks, indicating it's for a beginner. But some of the exercises are way beyond what a beginner could do. Plus, without explanation she'll use yoga names for poses but not explain them, then do the pose with a block. Who is this for?

The exercises are fine, suitable for high beginner-low intermediate yogi.",1399852800,10,467,4.295454545454546
5675715,4,B00BUFDRSQ,"I liked this stretching dvd.  I thought it could have been a bit longer and a bit more challenging.  Although, Karen does do some stretching exercises that I haven't found on any other dvd's, so that is a plus.  All in all a good workout.",1397779200,,238,4.2444444444444445

8574052,5,B00BUFDRSQ,"Excellent poses and helpful for those with stiff back, legs and arms.
I have taught Yoga for seven years and realized that yoga is designed for one purpose onlyto open up the
mind and body to the false gods of the East.
I guickly changed to stretching and core conditioning classes. This DVD is perfect without that yoga Sanskrit stuff.
I have a Hindi brother and he does not understand why the all the bother with yoga. Yoga means differently to those of the Hindi faith.",1461110400,,472,4.5
