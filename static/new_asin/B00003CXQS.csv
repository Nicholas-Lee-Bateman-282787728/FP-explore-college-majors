1270860,4,B00003CXQS,"All the scenes in this movie in which Mel Gibsons character can hear what women are thinking are hilarious, but the scenes in which he can't I found to be rather boring. Overall the movie is quite good, I wasn't that disappointed with it. Some of the jokes you could hear all the women in the audience laugh, but I didn't get what was so funny about them. This is definetly a chick flick.",977961600,,388,4.256756756756757
1270861,5,B00003CXQS,I thought the movie was funny and I liked Mel and Helen's chemistry. I thought the girl(ERIN PLAYED BY JUDY GREER)did a great job I wish at the end they would have showed her in her new job if she got it. I think they could have showed her sscenes a little more in depth then they did. All in all I thought the movie was funny and I loved Mel in pantyhose.,977616000,,356,3.8904109589041096
1270862,3,B00003CXQS,"This movie was far from what I expected. I guess that's my fault...I was expecting a laugh a minute comedy, but the seriousness of the picture was something that wasn't expected. There were one or two laughs along the way, but nothing more. The film was amusing at first, but it just started to drift, becoming way too long and often very boring. The ending especially dragged on and on. To make matters worse, I still don't understand what the hell women want, so the title kinda goes to waste. I guess this is a movie to see once, just because the premise is so far-fetched and orginal, but it is not as amusing as one would expect it to be...the performances were good, but overall, it was typical Hollywood bullshit with a few truly good scenes...I saw Chocolat the same week and would definitely recommend that over this any day...",977356800,,836,4.543046357615894
1270863,4,B00003CXQS,"At first from seeing previews, I assumed this would just be a dumb comedy full of dirty jokes.  However, this movie, although it is very funny, moves above the normal level of comedy movies.  Part of this is due to the likability of the two main characters.  I felt Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson were an adorable couple, and I was really rooting for them throughout the movie.  The basic plot is that Nick (Gibson) recieves an electrical shock that allows him to read women's minds.  This naturally provides for some funny moments, but more importantly through listening to women's thoughts he is able to gain a better understanding of what a women wants from a man.  While there are some questionable scenes and somewhat racy jokes, this is overall a relatively tasteful movie with a well chosen cast.",977097600,,798,4.705035971223022
1270864,3,B00003CXQS,"Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt in a romantic comedy might have been something to look forward to, but once again Hollywood underwhelms us with it acumen. Directed, mostly written, and co-produced by women, what they seem to have wanted is a lot of Mel Gibson surrounded by mostly one dimensional female characters. The conceit, that a man somehow becomes privy to the thoughts of all the women around him, has loads of potential, it could have been a riot. So:
Mel Gibson (Conspiracy Theory) is an actor of grace, charm and self-deprecating humor and dispite the limitations of the script and direction his performance as the telepathic Nick Marshall is pretty good.
Helen Hunt's (As Good As It Gets) Darcy Maguire might have been a potent combination of intelligence, drive and hidden vulnerability. Imagine her playing Darcy with James L. Brooks directing. Even here she's an actor worth watching.
Marisa Tomei, (My Cousin Vinny) minute for minute, almost steals the movie as a coffee shop countergirl. Why doesn't she get more and better parts?
Ashley Johnson does a nice job as Nick's daughter. Unfortunately the humor and poignancy of a fully realized father-daughter relationship never reaches it's full potential.
Cinematography is by Dean Cundey (Romancing the Stone), there is a nice shot of Gibson and Hunt kissing as two black profiles. Music is by Alan Silvestri (Soapdish, Father of the Bride), with great old retro tunes sung by Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Lou Rawls, Peggy Lee, Nancy Wilson and The Temtations.",976924800,11,1528,5.067460317460317

1271327,5,B00003CXQS,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out.  Still as funny as ever!  Men say they want to know what women are actually thinking -- but, I think it would make their heads explode if they knew half of what was going through our minds.  A man who is so self-involved would be sorely disappointed (as was Gibson's character) when he finds that women don't find him half as funny, clever, or intelligent as he believes they see him, showing that one of the biggest differences between men and women is that women (in general) will be polite and tolerant of the ridiculous and sexist things said by men.  It's heartwarming to see how he uses it to try to connect with his teenage daughter.  Truly a great ""chick flick"".

1271743,5,B00003CXQS,"This is a smart, clever and funny romantic comedy that no one should miss!  Ok, the genre of romantic comedy has plenty of somewhat silly, feel-good films, which rarely do more than entertain...which is fine.  But when the writing, directing (thank you, Nancy Myers) acting, and production values (thank you David MacFadzean, et al), then you have a true gem, a film that will be watched and appreciated for years to come.

The writing is unbeatable.  It reminds me of the much, much more sophisticated - and funny - dialogue of those savvy movies of the 1940's. See Myrna Loy and William Powell, Rosalind Russell and, well, anyone, Hepburn and Tracy, etc.  The dialogue and the actors' skill in delivering it are what makes those movies truly solid gold.

""What Women Want"" is solid gold as well! The plot, in case you don't know, involves a slick, manipulative ad man, played by Mel Gibson.  When the story opens, he is starting his work day with the expectation that he will receive a promotion to head honcho. And he is not grateful or humble about it.  He is glib and full of himself. Somehow he gets his head through the door of the office building (great set design here) and gleefully primes himself for the big coronation to come.  Instead, he has a rude awakening. He learns an ad exec from a competing firm has been hired to take the position he anticipated. The biggest blow to his infinite ego, however, is that the new ad exec is a woman - played to a fine-tuned hilt by the inimitable Helen Hunt.  Hunt plays an open, charming woman who introduces herself at her first staff meeting with humility and savvy.  She asks all the ad staff to recognize that the future of advertising must include an appeal to women, whose buying powers are enormous and who, as a group, have been ignored or marginalized by many ad agencies, but particularly this agency, leading it to miss out on enormous revenues for the firm.  This firm has had a particularly bad track record in reaching women, and is the bastion of the old-school approach of using scantily clad, nubile young women to sell everything from cars to insurance.  So, Helen Hunt gives her first assignment to her new team: take home a box of women's products from various companies which are all searching for new ad representation. She urges them to look at, try out, think about the products, and then reconvene to see what ideas team members have developed.

Through half-hearted diligence and a ""divine intervention"", Mel Gibson's character suddenly acquires the ability to hear what women are thinking, with hilarious results.  This would be a shock for any guy, but particularly for him, a guy who was raised among showgirls, his mother among them, in the seedy, greedy world of Las Vegas.

Thus he becomes a savant at understanding women. Will he use his power for evil or for good?  The answer is a tour de force of laughs, insights, tenderness, and charm!  Will he learn more about himself or the women in his life?

The story blossoms even more fully because of a terrific supporting cast of characters, his daughter, ex-wife, secretaries at work and, my favorite, a winsome, quiet young intern at the agency played beautifully by Judy Greer.

There is not a wasted moment in this movie: every scene is a delight.  The ensemble cast and the amazing writing raise this film to a top-notch comedy.

And the two main players, Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson, give performances that are Oscar-worthy...and just downright delightful.

This is also one of those rare romantic comedies that passes the testosterone test: men laugh out loud at this film, a rarity for the genre.

So, don't waste a moment - stream, rent, buy this wonderful film and keep it handy because you will want to watch it again and again.",1441670400,2,3772,4.697568389057751

I will not in any way call myself an expert on the subject of what women want, but I feel pretty comfortable in saying that this probably isn't it.  True, this movie came out before its star, Mel Gibson, had his meltdown, so I'll try not to be biased.  Nevertheless, this film never shies away from reminding us that Gibson's character is a chauvinist...it practically beats us over the head with this fact.  Yes, we get it!  Helen Hunt, on the other hand, seemed much more natural in her role, both thanks to her acting and the script...no fear of head injuries there.  We can see her as a smart, head-strong, successful ad executive and enjoy doing so.  Again, I'm no expert on what women want (perhaps I'm now beating you across the head with that), but I'm not sure this film is it.  Watch it and form your own opinion.

There is, of course, no way to know EXACTLY what a person is thinking yet it was a great fun way for people to get somewhat of an inside look into a woman's thought process. Mel Gibson + Helen Hunt were perfect for the roles :-)  You can tell they really researched their characters and how they would react in their unique situations and because of that, it was very easy to become completely absorbed into the movie. There was also a lot of truth in the story line. It showed how truly complex a woman's thought process is and how our minds just constantly run over millions of details ALL the time. Mel's reactions to hearing every woman's thoughts was priceless and genuine which made the movie so totally engaging.

1272275,4,B00003CXQS,"An amusing film which sets up a scenario that a man can suddenly hear what women are thinking.  Nick (Mel Gibson) used to be a rather insensitive arrogant man, confident of his abilities and allure to women.  His world changes.  Along with it he is given the power to know what women are thinking.  Suddenly, he sees the world from a woman's perspective.  Quite amusing.  Found this to be an entertaining, if not perfect, film that is great when you want something light.",1384300800,,471,4.614457831325301
1272276,2,B00003CXQS,"It was a man's world, when I was a kid. Men went first in line and women served them. Some men abused their power and eventually the feminist movement exploded in reaction. I would not condone the abuse and mistreatment of women which has occurred. Hollywood entertained men by reducing women to nothing more than sex objects and women ultimately revolted.

Now Hollywood is producing movies like What Women Want in order to teach a generation of cavemen the new rules. Today's world is a woman's world and in order for men to succeed they must learn to think like a woman thinks. According to the new rules, right is what women want. Women must be accepted as they are.

In the movie Mel Gibson discovers that he can hear what women are thinking as a result of an accident. Eventually he loses this ""gift,"" but not before he learns what women want. Thus, with no outside help except for an electrical short in his hair dryer, Mel transforms himself from a chauvinist to a sensitive male.

Early in the movie the proposition is stated that in order to understand a man you have to know his mother. Mel's mother was a Los Vegas show girl and so Mel grew up relating to women as sex objects. While every man's mother was not a stripper, the point is that men adopt the values of their culture. Women, in general, were exploited as sex objects during the last half of the twentieth century, so this is the view men have of women.

This, of course, is an over-generalization which implicates all men as beasts. The movie also perpetuates the old stereotype that men don't listen and are basically clods. These assumptions are the basis of every sit-com on TV. Men are constantly bombarded with this same message -- they are incompetent.

Their only salvation, then, is to give women what they want. If a man leers after a woman, he is a beast. But when Mel hears what women think, they often were thinking vulgar thoughts about men. The only difference is that women have to be themselves and accepted for who they are.

When Mel's daughter treats him with disrespect, he has no choice but to take it because women are supposed to free to say whatever they want to say. When he walks in on his fourteen-year old daughter fornicating on his sofa with her boyfriend, he is the clod. But when she wants the most expensive prom dress and all the accessories, the ""old man"" gives her what she wants. When she gets to the prom and decides against submitting to rape, he comes to her rescue. But the morality of the teenager is her choice; it is Dad's job to accommodate her choices.

If a man and a woman are both competing for the same job promotion and the man beats the woman out of the position, it is because he is a boorish beast. However, as the movie ends Helen Hunt loses her job to Mel. Mel then shows that he has reformed by giving her his promotion and she in turn fires him. However, she is not portrayed as insensitive for firing him because whatever a woman does is right.

So Hollywood is still teaching situational ethics, its just that the roles have been reversed. The movie emphasizes several themes, which are true but only state half of the reality. Such themes as -- It's not easy to be a woman. Women wish their husbands understood them. Women worry all the time -- reflects the struggles of both men and women.

We really are no further up the road toward better relationships with carnal women in charge than we were when carnal men were in the driver's seat. Jesus taught that our first priority was to give God what he wants. God requires both men and women to repent of their sins against each other. Then the Holy Spirit will begin the process of transformation. That process includes a death to our self-centeredness.

In other words giving sinful women what they want will no more produce a utopian society than giving sinful men what they want produced happiness on earth. The tension between men and women in our society will be solved only when both men and women surrender their rights, die to their agendas, and seek to live by God's precepts.

Jesus taught that unless a person hates his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters -- yes, even his own life -- he cannot be a disciple of Christ. Anyone who does not carry his cross and follow Christ cannot be his disciple (Luke 14:26-27). By definition, our ""cross"" is to die to what we want in order to fulfill what Christ wants. Christ demands first place.

It is nice if I can please myself while I am obeying Christ, but when I come to a fork in the road I must go down the road he leads whether or not it is what I would choose. If I can obey Christ while giving women what they want, that is well and good. But if my obedience to Christ causes me to displease another woman or man, that is the cross I must bear. Jesus warned that he did not come to bring peace, but a sword. A total commitment to Christ will produce a strain between a man and his father, a daughter and her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and by implication -- all other human relationships. ""A man's enemies will be the members of his own household"" (Matt 10:36). Jesus again requires us to love him above all other loves and to relinquish control of our life for his sake (v 37).

Men who use women to get what they want, will never get what they are really seeking. And men who give women what they want, in order to get in return what they want, will ultimately never find fulfillment either. Thus, the new role reversal advocated by What Women Want will satisfy neither men nor women in the long run.

The relational struggle between men and women is a result of the curse of sin. We have not advanced from the dynamics first described in Genesis 3:16. A woman will desire to be the master; her husband will tend to be overbearing in his rule over her. The only answer is for both men and women to submit to what God wants.",1381795200,3,5926,4.429752066115703
1272277,4,B00003CXQS,"...this one's quite good.

""What Woment Want"" (2000) is about a chauvinistic executive (Mel Gibson) who accidentally receives the power to hear women's thoughts, which is both scary and enlightening (and funny). Helen Hunt plays his romantic insterest while Lauren Holly is his ex-wife and Marisa Tomei his one-night stand. Ashley Johnson is also on hand as his daughter, who is shocked when she sees her distant father showing signs of really caring.

The ending gets a little too mushy, but ""What Women Want"" is consistently entertaining throughout. It's basically a story of redemption -- a chauvinistic man learning the error of his ways in a fun way, and changing.

The film runs 127 minutes and was mostly shot in Chicago with some senes in the Los Angeles area.

A wonderful cast, a great script and a perfect score make ""What women want "" one of those movies that leave us with that positive feeling that is so hard to come by.  Mel Gibson is fantastic in his portrayal of the sexist, selfish bussinessman who learns how to listen to women as he begins to realize how important they really are, and all of that wonderfully directed by Nancy Meyers, an expert in the field, who is one of the few directors left in Hollywood who really know how to tell a good romantic story. It's so good you just don't want the film to end!

They serve as background for Gibsons action. Now, Gibson is not Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, or Billy Crystal, or the other comedian/actors in and around his age, he is not a funny actor at all. Nevertheless in this film he gives an acceptable  performance. The gimmick, his being able to hear women's thoughts (why not men's thoughts as well?--answer, it would not serve the plot as well), is not used with any particular creativity, but it does work to set up a number of key scenes. Over-all, to my surprise, it was a moderately amusing film with some fun",1324598400,,715,4.6299212598425195

1272409,3,B00003CXQS,"Mel Gibson stars as a womanizer and a bit of a jerk who suddenly gains telepathy after a lightning strike. For some reason, his telepathy only extends to hearing the thoughts of women.

While this premise could have turned into a fascinating story, what we get is actually predictable jokes and a predictable growth of character, which occurs somewhat suddenly in the last acts of the film. The typical antithetical male-female relationship is present between Mel and Helen Hunt. It proceeds according to the formula for a long while, but for some reason the ubiquitous ""crisis before declarations of love"" doesn't ring true in this film. It seems very forced, even more so than that plot element normally is.

Still, there are entertaining scenes in the film, and it was made during Mel Gibson's ""hot streak"" (and before he turned his personal life into an ethical and PR nightmare), when just his presence in a film seemed to make it worth watching, no matter what else was going on.

The DVD presentation is solid, not spectacular by any means. This is not the type of film that I care to watch extras on, as there are no special effects magic tricks to explain, and no interesting movie history to be explored, so I won't speak to those.",1310256000,,1241,4.709677419354839

Feel free to rent it and watch it with your lady.

This actually reminds me of an ebook that's floating around called the masculine confident man.  This character exuded it and it added to his charm with men and women.

1272411,4,B00003CXQS,"Why did people love Mel Gibson, before he set fire to his career?  I watched this movie, and how I missed the old Mel, the funny Mel, the guy who could laugh at himself.

What Women Want is a battle of the sexes movie, but its also a very funny movie about the change that came to advertising when the retail world woke up and realized that women really did control a whole lot of the money.  What to do? What to do?  Things had progressed beyond Mad Men, of course but agencies still had a whole lot of men sitting around trying to imagine what women wanted--instead of hiring them to handle the problem.

In What Women Want, one dinosaur of a man, Mel Gibson (yeah, I know)  gets to hear what is going on in women's heads.  Its quite a shock because even though this guy has lived a charmed life--he never suspected that so many of the women around him were thinking that he was a Class A jerk.  Furthermore, he found he deserved it.  Gibson doesn't turn into Mister-Sensitive-Man but he does begin to understand that the opposite sex seems to be made up of human beings.  And he is really really funny as he finds out.

Helen Hunt is great in this movie, but there are lots and lots of well known actresses in small roles.  The soundtrack is classy, romantic and perfect--with lots of that ""man's man"" Frank Sinatra, to set just the right tone.",1269043200,,1347,4.322709163346613

Using it, he manipulates his boss by giving all of Darcy's ideas as his own. But then he falls in love with Darcy and he suddenly loses his gift. ""What Women Want"" is an original, feel-good comedy that will have you on the floor. If you want to laugh, this is the movie to see.",1264809600,,672,4.341269841269841
1272483,4,B00003CXQS,"When I first began to watch ""What Women Want"" I thought ""Here we go again"", another silly comedy with tons of sex jokes, right? Wrong! This film is very sweet and charming and might I add well written and directed. Mel Gibson plays a playboy ad executive who verges on the misogynistic. One day, during a freak electrical storm (is there any other kind?) he is zapped and wakes up with the ability to read women's thoughts. At firs he abuses this newfound power to bed them, but soon figures out how to help women with their problems. His reading of their minds lets him know the insecurities that women have, and helps him connect with his daughter. My favorite section of this film is when Gibson visits the home of one of his employees who's condidering suicide and talks her out of it. The performances are all top-notch, but I must give honorable mention to Marissa Tomei who almost steals the pic form Helen hunt and Gibson. She plays a struggling actress who moonlights as a barrista in the building where Mel works. She has been hurt by many men and is hesitant in going out again. Mel, thanks to his super-powers, manages a date with her. It's on this date that Marissa's emotions run the gamut. Overall this is a feel good movie, that ALL men should see.",1235174400,,1264,4.5
1272484,5,B00003CXQS,"I recently caught a smidgen of this film on cable; so I when I saw it in the budget bin I snapped it up.  I liked the film when it first came out, but I think it's aged well.  Director Nancy Meyers likes does a tremendous job putting together the talent and keeping the pace brisk. She's directed ""Something's Gotta Give"" &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Holiday/dp/B000MQC9H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Holiday</a>.  She gets that comedy is means, but telling a good story is the end.  Nick Marshall's becoming a man who has compassion is a lovely story, well told.  Mel Gibson plays the lead character with charm, wit and moxie.  I particularly love the scene where he puts Sinatra on the phonograph and dances joyfully around the room.  The panty hose scene had me in hysterics.  In the DVD extras, Gibson comments on how Hunt is SO good that you feel that she is in the whole movie, even though her screen time is limited.  As Darcy Macguire, Hunt delivers a blockbuster, nuanced performance, comic, romantic and dazzling.  Hunt won the Oscar & Golden Globe for ""As Good as It Gets.""  In this film, I particularly like the moment where she fires Nick.  I've seen this film before, yet find myself continually surprised.  Helen Hunt raves about Marisa Tomei's performance in the film in the DVD extras.  As Lola, Tomei comes on like a whirlwind as the coffee shop girl who doesn't want to be romantically hurt.  Tomei won her Oscar for ""My Cousin Vinny"" and was nominated for ""In the Bedroom.""  She is superb.

Smaller roles also offer strong support.  Alan Alda plays the head of the advertising agency, Dan Wanamaker.  Alda got his Oscar nomination for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aviator/dp/B00095LIE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aviator</a>.  His brief screen appearances are filled with energy.  Mark Feuerstein who was in ""Defiance"" plays Nick's coworker Morgan Farwell.  Bette Midler has a cameo as Nick's psychiatrist.  Delta Burke plays Eve and Valerie Perrine plays Margo, Marshall's office assists.  They have one of the great gags of the film when Nick tries to read their minds, but no thoughts are going on.  Ashley Johnson from TV's ""Growing Pains"" plays Nick's daughter.  His increasingly close relationship with her is another heartwarming element that makes this film worth revisiting.  Lauren Holly from ""Ace Ventura"" has a brief cameo as Ashley's mother Gigi.  Judy Greer from ""27 Dresses"" &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amateurs/dp/B000XJ5UEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amateurs</a>&nbsp;has a moving role as the shy office girl Erin who thinks of ending her life.

1272485,3,B00003CXQS,"First, the bad things: formulaic chick flic. Make that CHICK FLIC. The other bad thing, is Helen Hunt is as dry and unappealing as always (she sleepwalks through her performance, I'm not sure she ever felt pain at all when she was ""acting"" emotionally distraught). In addition, there aren't enough laughs to keep a guy interested when his girlfriend/wife makes him watch this. In addition, the ""thoughts"" that women have in the movie are both far too PG and PC to be believable, and any man who swallows that crap is doomed. This is what women would like to think of themselves thinking, not what they really think about most of the time (not that I would know, which is the point, right?). Alan Alda smarms his way through another role where he can't stop calling attention to the fact that he is Alan Alda. Would someone take up a collection for some acting classes for this lame-O, please?
The good things: Mel Gibson gives a stunning performance as a man's man advertising executive who must reinvent himself as a meterosexual when his new boss arrives (Hunt) and starts dropping the Swedish Bikini Team advertising techniques to go after women-customer target accounts. This is delightful tension and a delightful plot twist.
Director Nancy Meyers does a superb job, both in framing shots and making the visual narrative match the script and tone setting of the dialogue. There is some flavor of Chicago in the film which adds to the aura.
But the best thing Meyers did, other than her mistakes with Alan Alda and Helen Hunt, is the casting. All the secondary women characters have real women's bodies, not the faux emaciated size zero everyone has defaulted to expect in films nowadays. For example, Delta Burke is featured in a role where her curves are simply normal both in relative and absolute terms to all other women characters. This was an excellent decision, and Meyers is amply rewarded with excellent performances from cameo and secondary characters alike. No one need ever fear that this film will promote body type anxiety.
The movie is a bit overly long, and therefore the rather abrupt closure of the film appears a bit tacked on in response to going over budget or beyond shooting schedule. But all in all this is a stomachable film for those guys who have to sit through a chick flic every now and them with your slampiece. My wife had to watch ""Scareface"" with me in exchange, so it was a pretty good trade.",1226275200,,2431,4.722352941176471

1272487,5,B00003CXQS,"The movie starts a little emotional. Nick (Mel Gibson) is so arrogant that he doesn't even notice, what people around him happen to think about him. When Darcy (Helen Hunt) is promoted as his boss, his philosophy of life crumbles ...  From this point, the movie makes a very enjoyable comedy. The audience is delivered quite a good insight into his moral -- compared to his workmates, who are astonished, what a man Nick actually can be.  Yet, as soon as he falls in love with Darcy, the whole film is drawn slowly but irresistibly towards a drama losing much of its potential. It seems that Nancy Meyers tried to combine the funny plot with an appealing drama. Unfortunately, the movie just can't cope with such a claim.  The performances of Gibson and Hunt are remarkable. Particularly the scene he plays Fred Astaire in, made me laugh heartily. Altogether, I give this movie 8 of 10 points, since it _is_ worth watching.

What Women Want has some funny scenes and dips its beak into a few taboo subjects, and although it raised eyebrows for its blatant plugging of several brand name products, all passed off as internal storytelling at a fictional ad agency, some of the subject matter here really was kind of bravely touched upon considering this movie came from the normally placid waters of the studio that released it. '90's A-lister Helen Hunt is still fun to watch (whatever happened to her, by the way?) and a mentally voyeuristic Gibson plays the slightly kooky man-granted-fantasy-insight-into women's-minds with the right mix of charm, awe and shame. Just hearing him deliver the line, ""...oh, I'm REALLY gay..."" was worth the purchase price.

Chaucer's original was fun, and so is this film.",1189468800,,392,4.342465753424658
1272554,5,B00003CXQS,"This is a charming movie with a great soundtrack and superb acting by Mel Gibson and Marisa Tomei.  Gibson reaches a peak of comedic genius in the movie, playing funny and compassionate moments with equal skill.  Although the movie's premise is rather absurd--a man who can hear women's thoughts after accidentally electrocuting himself in the bathroom--the viewer suspends disbelief and is drawn into the plot.  Marisa Tomei is hilarious as the ditzy coffee shop girl.  Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine, as well as Bette Midler, all have minor roles and are great in them.  Mark Feuerstein as Gibson's buddy is also excellent.  Some of the funny lines get a laugh from me every single time I watch (e.g., ""The poodle give you that one?"").  I loved the music, which included songs by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Cole Porter, and more.  This is a romantic comedy, and although I find it hard to see Helen Hunt as a vulnerable, romantic leading lady--I think of her more as the sardonic character in ""Mad About You""--I thought she acted well in the movie and even worked in some ""cupcake""-type moves.  This is a DVD whose extra features are worth watching, particularly director Nancy Meyers' comments on how the movie was made.  This movie is a keeper that marries the modern dilemmas of romance with the feel of romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s.  Mel Gibson's dance scene and the scene where he waxes his leg are outstanding, and he is entirely believable as the chauvinistic playboy who is shocked at what women think.

1272556,4,B00003CXQS,"This movie is surprisingly charming, given the fact that critics pilloried it when it first came out. All I can say is that Mel Gibson still has what it takes to be a leading man in a romantic comedy.

The movie certainly opens promisingly enough with a hilarious sneak preview into the childhood of the main character, Nick, a top advertising agency executive that Mel Gibson plays with great aplomb. Nick is a divorced, male chauvinist who thinks that he is God's gift to women. Unfortunately, as so many men of this type are, he is dead wrong. He is just a man's man who thinks that he is a ladies' man.

He begins to get his comeuppance when the coveted job of Creative Director, to which he is expecting to be promoted, is offered to someone outside the agency, another advertising whiz named Darcie, affectingly played by Helen Hunt. She gets the job, rather than he, so that the agency might be better able to tap into the women's market. She is now his new boss, and Nick is not happy.

After their first meeting, the disgruntled Nick goes home and drinks himself into a stupor. Look for the wonderful dance routine done in best Fred Astaire style. It is a charming salute to an all time great. While in his inebriated state, however, Nick has a shocking accident (pun intended) that enables him to be able to read women's minds.

This ability causes him some distress, as he is amazed to find out what women really think of him, and it is not always flattering. It also enables him to please women as never before, as he is able to read their innermost thoughts and anticipate their needs. It even helps him repair his relationship with his fifteen year old daughter who is undergoing teenage angst.

He uses this ability, however, to trump Darcie, unbeknownst to her, as he has every intention of getting the job he coveted. What he does not anticipate is falling in love with her. This certainly puts a kink into his plans. The question is whether love will triumph. Watch the movie and find out.

The contrivance of being able to read women's minds creates some very funny scenes and interesting situations. It also allows Nick's character to grow as a person and become more three dimensional. There is a strong supporting cast that includes Delta Burke, Marisa Tomei, and an unbilled cameo by by Bette Midler. This is an engaging film that, oddly enough, is sure to delight both men and women, and Mel Gibson, with his easy going charm, is definitely what women want.",1165276800,,2481,4.589164785553048

well, i bet some of the stuff said in there where it has the woman thinking out loud was garbage. not all women are the same, and not all men are the same... you can't believe every thing a woman says. not all women want what that one individual woman wants and some women lie. but hey, nobody's perfect. every guy had individual tastes too, and guys lie sometimes to.

i for one, as far what i finad sexually appealing with a woman's appearance, like women who are a tad bigger. i like'em to weigh about 140 to 160 lbs. if they're around 5'5"" to 5'7"". yet there are guys who like petite women(i personlly don't know why).

there shouldn't be a movie that tries to help guys get girls. the movie title ""what women want"" was just wrong. i bet many guys thought of it as the gateway to seriously improving their game if they're looking for a date.

i personally think guys put way too much emphasis on trying to find out what women want. i don't think that should be necessary. i think it's ridiculous. i think the guy should be himself like the girl is practially all the time and just feel good about himself. not every girl is going to be into every guy... i think self-confidence is probably the most important thing for a guy to have when trying to get women.

i'm a guy and that's my opinion....",1154044800,2,1833,4.255747126436781
1272559,4,B00003CXQS,"This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy, but with an interesting twist; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts. The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking.

I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie. The idea of a man being able to read women's minds is clever and amusing. Should this ever happen, would it be classified as a gift, or a nightmare?",1153526400,3,1464,4.7637795275590555
1272560,4,B00003CXQS,"This movie is surprisingly charming, given the fact that critics pilloried it when it first came out. All I can say is that Mel Gibson still has what it takes to be a leading man in a romantic comedy.

The movie certainly opens promisingly enough with a hilarious sneak preview into the childhood of the main character, Nick, a top advertising agency executive that Mel Gibson plays with great aplomb. Nick is a divorced, male chauvinist who thinks that he is God's gift to women. Unfortunately, as so many men of this type are, he is dead wrong. He is just a man's man who thinks that he is a ladies' man.

He begins to get his comeuppance when the coveted job of Creative Director, to which he is expecting to be promoted, is offered to someone outside the agency, another advertising whiz named Darcie, affectingly played by Helen Hunt. She gets the job, rather than he, so that the agency might be better able to tap into the women's market. She is now his new boss, and Nick is not happy.

After their first meeting, the disgruntled Nick goes home and drinks himself into a stupor. Look for the wonderful dance routine done in best Fred Astaire style. It is a charming salute to an all time great. While in his inebriated state, however, Nick has a shocking accident (pun intended) that enables him to be able to read women's minds.

This ability causes him some distress, as he is amazed to find out what women really think of him, and it is not always flattering. It also enables him to please women as never before, as he is able to read their innermost thoughts and anticipate their needs. It even helps him repair his relationship with his fifteen year old daughter who is undergoing teenage angst.

He uses this ability, however, to trump Darcie, unbeknownst to her, as he has every intention of getting the job he coveted. What he does not anticipate is falling in love with her. This certainly puts a kink into his plans. The question is whether love will triumph. Watch the movie and find out.

The contrivance of being able to read women's minds creates some very funny scenes and interesting situations. It also allows Nick's character to grow as a person and become more three dimensional. There is a strong supporting cast that includes Delta Burke, Marisa Tomei, and an unbilled cameo by by Bette Midler. This is an engaging film that, oddly enough, is sure to delight both men and women, and Mel Gibson, with his easy going charm, is definitely what women want.",1146096000,2,2481,4.589164785553048

1272562,3,B00003CXQS,"Setting the scene, Mel Gibson's character is introduced in a pointless flashback that sees his childhood self being raised in exceptional circumstances. Why? I would have thought that the idea behind the film is that most men don't listen to women - whatever their upbringing? So why make him exceptional?

The film only really gets going once he's been ""gifted"" with the power to read womens' thoughts. Then it becomes interesting. Though I'd rather have seen Bruce Willis play the lead. He's more of a man's man than Mel ever will be.

Helen Hunt is adequate. And the daughter was forgettable. (btw Why was it portrayed as unreasonable for the Mel character to get angry when he found his 15 year old daughter bra-less and canoodling with her 18 year old boyfriend when he walked in unexpectedly. Like ""Hey, Dad. That is like soooo uncool!"" No it's not - it's normal!)

The film is a fairytale. A piece of fluff. And unlikely to change the planet as we know it so why worry. Okay with pizza and wine on a cheap date, I imagine - especially if the guy wants to impress his girlfriend with his metrosexual credentials.",1136419200,4,1118,4.636363636363637

1272604,4,B00003CXQS,"A star-studded cast is gathered in this tale of an advertising man who manages to gain the power to hear what women are thinking.  While at first he almost goes crazy, he soon learns, with the help of an odd therapist, to take advantage of the situation and improve his relationships with the various women he is in contact with.  Three women are his main targets.  Marisa Tomei is a simple sexual conquest.  Helen Hunt is the woman who became his boss.  And a quiet office worker who may need more help than anyone.

Mel Gibson does an excellent job as the man with the power.  Helen Hunt does a passable job as a love interest but the script just does not show her as qualified for her new job.  She is shown as being a good advertiser but not as a Creative Director.  This is the fault of the script and not the actress.  I was a little put off by the Bette Midler character who basically convinces Mel to take advantage of women.  This is probably not really what was intended but it is what the script results in.  But still, the acting is pretty good throughout with Gibson really shining during his solo scenes.

A pretty good movie for couples although the final resolution may be a little weak for couples looking for a really good romance story.  Light humor, heavy humor, and some touching moments combine to keep the movie fresh and moving.  Check it out.",1130803200,5,1367,4.412

I felt he gave one of his best performances here. You couldn't help but get lost in his character, despite even when he was a jerk to women. He makes you intrigued by the confidence of his character. Which is most likely why he attracts so many females in this movie. Helen Hunt did well, but I just felt Mel had the best role and it fit, perfectly. Ashley Johnson did great as his daughter. To date, also her best performance.

So, Mel can read women's minds. So cue LOTS of scenes of women checking him out, forming clear, straight sentences in their minds (does anyone talk to themselves like the women in this movie? If anyone could read anyone's mind, wouldn't it just be a bunch of indeciphrable gibberish, half sentences, words, songs and ideas?)

But I digress. I can buy any premise if it's well thought out and, for a comedy - funny. And this isn't any of those things. Instead we get to see Mel mugging to the camera for an hour and a half until all you want to do is smash his head in with a shovel, Psycho II style. ""Are you sure you won't have any tea, Mel? CLANNNNNNNG"". Now THAT I would watch.

So, is this DVD What Women Want? Maybe, but only the really stupid ones.

Alan Alda has a nice supporting turn as the manager of the agency.  Gibson is undeniably charming, and Hunt is amazingly good in her complex role.

This film also works much better in Widescreen: I have seen it previously in  VHS  pan and scan, and the director did a great job ( but once you realise just how much coverage she did on each shot, you can't help but realise that a fair amount of the things that women say in the film must be at least partially true); Now, if only more males would admit that they did some of the same things for pretty much the same reason.

I believe that I think clearly, that is, in real sentences and coherent sequence of thoughts only rarely, and only when I am alone - driving or walking outside. Even then my mind jumps from one association to another like crazy. I don't think I even bother to always verbalize my thoughts, I do it only when I think about what I am going to say to someone. My thoughts are even harder to categorize when I am in the middle of a conversation with another person. I do not have coherent thoughts coming in long clear sentences but something which is more like images, notes I make to myself about the other person, short words. I am therefore quite sure that my mind, or other people's mind for that matter, does not act in the way presented in the movie but is more like a disorganized sack with lots of items inside, most of them irrelevant to the subject matter...That is, the main idea of the movie seems a little wrong to me. However, this very long preface only leads to what I really want to say: I understand that this movie has several flaws, amongst which the way ""thinking"" (a central theme in the movie) is presented, but in spite of this and other flaws and the light easy nature of the movie, it is very entertaining and is able to touch, several quite serious subjects. My best part actually is when the male character, played by Mel Gibson talks about what he learned about women. ""They worry all the time..."", he says, and this sentence alone is worth watching the movie. Oh so true and such a real (very satisfying) moment.

Story is a little banal with all the right elements falling down at the right moment with our hero learning his lesson and being at the right place to save the day -- however men women relationship at the workplace are very nicely presented, all stereotypes included  (I loved the moment when Mel Gibson looks at his two secretaries and asks ""that's all""? after he gets no reaction from their brain.

Great comedy.  Nick Marshall was raised by a showgirl mother, and has always been pampered by women, of whom he takes advantage.  His ex-wife gets remarried and his teenaged (high school sophomore) daughter comes to visit while the ex-spouse is on honeymoon.

Nick works for a large ad agency and expects to be named Creative Director, but instead the agency head (Alan Alda) hires Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) to fill the position because they need to address the women's market.  Simultaneously, Nick gets the shock of his life when he falls in a bathtub full of water with a hairdryer, resulting in his ability to hear women's thoughts.

This is truly a funny situation comedy.  I would never have expected Gibson to do so well in comedy.  Helen Hunt, of course, is great.  The film has a large cast, and the director (a woman, naturally) Nancy Meyers does a superb job.  This is not a great movie, perhaps, but it is rich comedy and very entertaining.

1272686,5,B00003CXQS,"I found What Women Want to be an enlightening fun jaunt about relationships.  Mel Gibson (Nick Marshall) does his best when he is in the comical mode, and his wisecracking moves are reminescent of the romantic comedies of old.  Helen Hunt (Darcy McGuire)isn't that bad either despite her almost hard-nosed demeanor in presenting the professional woman of the twenty-first century.
The movie follows in the predictable plotline of here's the situation and who ends up winning in the end.  The relationship between Nick and his daughter dangles with incohesion as well as his concern for Erin, the invisible office ""runner"", which may have been a way to present more of Nick's softer side.  However, his hard-nosed side was quite weak in presentation.
Nevertheless, the film was a laugh a minute.  It would be a riot if men and women could actually hear each other's inner voices.  Ah, that's why we have the movies.",1086652800,2,914,4.9411764705882355

Mel Gibson is his usual ""I'm too cute for my own good"" self as he half-hamedly works his way through this inane story about an ad man (one of the usual careers for movie characters) who finds himself far more devilishly charming than others do. After a jolt to his under used brain he obtains the ability to read minds - but, for some mysterious yet convenient reason, only those of women. Instead of rubbing his hands together, laughing fiendishly, and start plotting to take over the world, he uses this new super human power to seduce the ladies, connive his way into a promotion, and manipulate his daughter. Of course, he learns some mighty important lessons in the process and changes into a better dad and a nice guy.
Helen Hunt is given nothing new to work with and might as well be doing an episode of her old sitcom without the laughs.
A perplexing amount of people seem to love this movie which must mean I have far superior taste <sticks nose in air> or else I'm just some twisted old hag who'd rather knit sweaters from my dog's hair then embrace this gift that Hollywood has so generously bestowed upon us.

So how did they wind up in this stilted, overproduced piece of jetsam?  I should know by now that any film written or directed by Nancy Meyers is going to stink, but somehow I watched this one anyhow.  Big mistake!  Every scene feels contrived; you can just see the writers going ""now comes the scene where.... ""
If the same premise had been developed by the ""Seinfeld"" team, it could have been hilarious. As-is, it's heavy-handed and moralizing through and through.  And Gibson gives his hammiest performance since ... well, ever.  Ugh!  I'm giving it two stars (rather than one) because Helen Hunt's warmth and sincerity make it at least bearable, and the production values are quite good for the most part.",1080432000,4,838,4.698630136986301
1272760,4,B00003CXQS,"Now here's a great movie. You got Mel Gibson playing a chauvanistic ad executive whose only primary goal in life is to get ahead in the business world, be a mediocre father, and nail every woman he possible can. Doesn't sound that appealing actually, does it? But alas, it makes for a brilliantly funny movie.
Gibson plays Nick, who lives each day to his Frank Sinatra records. He's crude and brash, but those baby blues are hard to resist. When he thinks he's about to be promoted, he learns that his boss hired a woman named Darcy (played by Helen Hunt)for the job he desperately wanted. The first thing she does is assign a fun project for all her fellow advertisers-- try out several women's products (mascara, lipstick) and come up with a tag line for them. Nick is, of course, totally annoyed, but he does it anyway, falling in the bathtub after slipping on little bath pearls and electrocuting himself with a hair dryer. And BAM! He can suddenly hear what women think. What he at first sees as a curse, a therapist (played by a funny Bette Midler) tells him he's got a power most men dream of-- he knows what women want! So the story unfolds with Nick learning about the women in his life and even having an actual relationship with Darcy.
This movie is funny and smart, and I never pictured Gibson in this role, although he fits it like a glove. The best kind of movie is the one where you actually believe the actors to be the people they're playing. Gibson has that effect nailed. The movie could have, however, done without the romance actually. Yes, perhaps that's odd of me to say considering that many people will class this movie as a romantic comedy. It would have been just fine with Nick learning about himself and seeing what exactly he could do to make the women around him feel less offended.
Bottom line-- this movie is definitely worth seeing. I recommend it to any man who doesn't know what women want at all to perhaps get a few pointers from a fellow clueless man. And those baby blues of Gibson's will have women swooning. It's well done, well directed, well acted, and well played out. See this one!",1079136000,3,2127,4.512953367875648

The situation gets tricky when, one night, he starts reading their minds due to a strange short circuit. Then, Nick acknowledges that women actually think and (surprise!) have feelings...Who could have guessed? And sometimes they aren`t quite what they seem at first. Yep, believe it because it`s true, folks... In order to solve this situation, he just has to act in a kindly, affective manner, and the new problems are solved. Not that difficult, heh?
So, this isn`t quite heavy material or thought-provoking stuff, although the beginning of the movie has its funny moments and scenes, credit be given to Gibson. But, as the plot unfolds, it all turns very predictable and even melodramatic, requiring the typical Hollywood ending that everyone`s expecting. Despite a somewhat promising central idea, this is just another average piece of fluff, simplistic and innocuous as it should.

Mel Gibson is great as Nick, although you can see he's really beginning to lose his looks - the shopping bags under his eyes really began to distract me. Up against Helen Hunt, who positively shines, Mel Gibson has really met his match. They make a cute couple during the film, although the tedious bit where they start ""getting to know each other"" is where the film really begins to dip.
Ashley Johnson plays Nick's teenage daughter, Alex, who Nick knows nothing about, but eventually ends up saving the day. I recognised her instantly, despite being 5 years older and now a brunette. She was the young girl who slapped Hugh Grant during 9 Months. Great moment! She should be proud of that.
The whole idea of the film is quite fun for both men and women to watch. Imagine if that could happen, how messed up would the world be?! A guy hearing a girl's thoughts, hearing what she really thinks about him. That could probably mess a guy up.
Now where's the sequel?! 'What Men Want', that could be interesting.",1073174400,2,1205,4.408071748878924

Unfortunately, stealing someone else's ideas to get ahead and steal her job is not the action of a charming scoundrel you're supposed to love despite yourself - it's the action of a louse you can't help but despise. Worse than that, he actually becomes rather good at the end of the picture, and repents and saves the life of a totally unimportant and boring female victim, just so we ""forgive"" him.

Helen Hunt plays Gibson's boss, and she's so sweet and helpless you wonder how she ever got to be a tea-lady,let alone a top executive in a ruthless business like advertising.  Gibson stitches her up by stealing her ideas, and naturally she can't do a thing to help herself, poor little thing, until he takes pity on her.  His daughter spends most of the film slavering with lust over her boyfriend, then suddenly she inexpicably goes off the idea of having ... with him (why?), but she can't get out of it herself, oh no, Daddy has to come and rescue her.

I don't understand why people put the tag ""Chic Flic"" on anything that has an element of romance in it.  If anything this movie is more about ""what if"" male fantasy. The premise is; you could read the oh so complex mind of a woman, how easy, and tempting it would be to misuse that information.
Mel Gibson seems to have as much a gift for physical comedy as he does for doing action pictures.  The scenes where he tries out womens products as a work assignment are priceless.  In this movie he has good chemistry with Helen Hunt, and it helps fill out the romatic side of the story well.  One of his other films:  Bird on a Wire was pretty flat because there was just no apparent attraction between him, and costar Goldie Hawn.  In this one the romantic chemistry works fine.

If the movie can be faulted its because its a little too short.  I would like to see Hollywood put a little more film in the can when they come up with a good idea like this.  Its not like they were spending a lot on special effects and car chases here.  The could have used a few more scenes.

Nick feels betrayed by his boss, played by Alan Alda, and threatened by Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt.  Darcy is hired to fill the position of creative director at an advertising firm.  This job was, in Nick's mind, his for the taking.
Now here's the twist.  Nick, while intoxicated, was trying on pantyhose and a waxing his legs in an effort to get in to the minds of women.  While doing this, he fell into the tub while holding a hairdryer.  After he woke, he could hear the inner-most thoughts of all females.  Be it a little girl, adult woman, and even a French poodle.  This gives him the ability to steal the ideas straight out of the heads of women.  He uses this to his advantage (after the shock of this ""gift"" wears off).  But, while he was using this gift for all the wrong reasons, he develops a conscience.
This movie is rather amusing.  Mr. Gibson is quite a capable actor.  He works remarkably well in the romantic comedy genre.  This movie was a pleasant surprise.

Obviously it did not have this effect on some of you, maybe even most of you, and my reviewer rating will take a serious hit from this.. but I want to put out the warning to those people who read the reviews, that if you are ever uneasy about Hollywood's attitudes about women, you'd better stay far away from this movie.
I found this movie incredibly insulting, in the way it portrayed every single female character, in the jokes, in the plot, and in the conclusion - pretty much beginning to end. I didn't go in looking for trouble, but it found me - I saw it in the theaters with a girlfriend looking for some light escapism and got a nasty reminder of just how dumb, useless, and incapable Hollywood thinks I am as a woman. This is present in some small degree in most every Hollywood romance, but it is obvious, blatant, rampant in this one. You know the premise. So, what do the women in this movie think about? Mel Gibson. Constantly. Their lives are practically centered around him. They have nothing better to think about, whether it's on the job or on the street. They are shallow. They are needy. Their careers are open to the manipulations of Mel Gibson's character, but we forgive him, because he is cute and much more important than anyone else. What does Mel Gibson learn about women? They sure do lots of dumb things, don't they? Funny! It sure is hard to look pretty all the time! Maybe Mel will deign to talk to them and make their lives worthwhile! What am I doing surfing the internet when I could be applying mascara and waxing my legs! What do I need a job for, anyway, when I could have a handsome boyfriend instead! Excuse me while I throw up.
This movie is not funny, and manages to be incredibly derivative of every successful romantic comedy without learning a thing from any of them. The leads are not compelling, as a couple or seperately. Mel Gibson's character is an ...at the start, and even more of an ... at the finish, even though we're supposed to believe he is enlightened for understanding how much women want him. Gee, thanks Mel. Are you gonna stop manipulating every girl in sight now? Can Marisa Tomei have her dignity back? Can Helen Hunt have her job back?
This probably won't bother a lot of you, so don't worry about it. It's the same old thing, only moreso. It's got eye candy, and requires no thought whatsoever. Keep giving Hollywood your money.

Nicky works for an ad agency. He thought he would be promoted. However, his boss is concerned that the domination of the maket is all about women. Therefore, Darcy (Halen Hunt) was hired to be a creative director instead of him since she is a woman. After he got that special skill, he trys to get rid of Darcy.

1272854,5,B00003CXQS,"Another great performance from Mel Gibson. Every split second of this movie has to be enjoyed, from start to finish. It is so good I got completely absorbed in it and could not suspend my attention at all !!! First of all, the cast is fantastic, especially Mel Gibson and Helen Hunter, both of them at their very best, absolutely fabulous !!! Helen Hunt is really perfect in the role of the highly successful career woman, yet so very inspiring, so very sincere, so very deeply feminine, and so moving. Then all the emotion, all the ideas contained in this movie are absolutely great and to the point. Finally, the story itself is interesting. The whole movie is really nice entertainment. It is also fast-paced, very dense, full of humor, and it is also a movie about truth versus illusion, truth against wrong. On top of all that, it is also a very deep and very rich movie, and it raises plenty of questions, and not only the easy ""Are women really superior to men ?"". The beginning of the movie is great, with Nick (Mel Gibson) born and raised in Las Vegas, among many women. As an adult, he is a kind of excited extrovert executive who is divorcing real-time ; Darcy (Helen Hunter) is a wonderful, newly appointed Product Manager in his company, and she puts the focus on female customers. She organizes a fantastic brainstorming session and gives samples of women's products to all the participants: lipstick, bath beads, panty hose, depilatory wax etc.  After that, Nick tries all the products that Darcy distributed during the meeting; he wants to know what a ""broad"" feels, and distributes common sense remarks...  One of the best scenes of the movie is when Darcy brings Nick into her wonderful state house. Then there is another great scene when Nick gets to his daughter during a party; she is so upset she hides in the toilets.  Helen Hunt is great, dazzling and the final kiss is absolutely wonderful. Like the whole movie, this scene is very rich in messsages. Finally the movie ends to the music of ""Night and Day""...
The movie contains great sentences like: ""men, not women, suffer from penis envy"", ""no games, just sport"", etc. The music is great, carefully selected and plays at the proper time. However, the original English version is much better than the french translation, which is not always properly conveying all the ideas and feelings.",1044316800,,2363,4.730582524271845
1272855,2,B00003CXQS,"I was able to watch ""What Women Want"" free of charge.
And that is the only way to watch it since it is quite disposable as a romantic comedy. This is one of those films the wife begs to see - if you catch my drift.
Now I am not saying I despise romantic comedies. Great ones do exist. This is simply not one of them.
The film starts out promisingly enough. The anti-Cary Grant character that Mel Gibson plays finds it necessary to clue his playboy self into what women want materially in order to keep up with the new female boss (Helen Hunt) at his ad agency. Due to a freakish accident (in one of the few genuinely funny scenes in the movie), he receives the gimmick of being able to actually hear women thinking. Blessed/cursed by this gift, he surmises that he can use it to get exactly what HE wants. Wronged by his new outsider boss who stole the position he was due, he subtly begins to undermine her career. But even as he does, he finds her to be more than he imagined, falling in love with her along the way. Think of it as an update of a film in the manner of ""His Girl Friday"".
But where that film is a classic, this one is a lesson in how to suffocate a movie. Each minute of running time draws a noose around the neck of the film so by the time it ends its finale is impossible to write. In fact, this movie has one of the most contrived and poorly-penned endings in the history of romantic comedies. My wife and I just looked at each other and said, ""Aw, c'mon!"" To the director/writer, I simply give the advice that it is essential to make the audience buy the ending in any romantic comedy. She failed miserably in this regard and just killed the movie. Sadly, the DVD's commentary track exposes her own trepidations concerning the ending, but she never listened to those nagging doubts and the ending is a mess because of that.
Oscar-winning actress Marisa Tomei is wasted in the film. Mel is often forced to do schtick while Oscar-winning Helen is simply lifeless compared to her turn in ""As Good As It Gets"". So much high-caliber talent, yet such torture to watch them flail within their caricatures. When you see the gears grinding, you know the film just isn't working.
The DVD offers no great redemption, either. Usually a director's commentary provides some insights, but the director is so self-important it is hard to listen. I feel for the male production designer who joined her on the commentary track because she interrupts him mercilessly. I think the director's misandry is showing.
So what rescues this movie from the dreaded one star review? Well, I'm being benevolent by giving it one more for the wonderful Astaire impression Mel does while dancing to ""Old Blue Eyes"". He also provides good laughs during his lame attempt to get in touch with his feminine side (just before receiving his supernatural ability.)
In short, skip this one and buy something worthy like ""A Room with a View"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Bringing Up Baby"", or ""When Harry Met Sally"".",1043280000,10,2986,4.511070110701107

1272888,4,B00003CXQS,"I have a confession to make. I am a dyed in the wool Mel Gibson fan, and I have been since Mad Max. Okay, despite hating most mainstream movies with everything from Adam Sandler to Joel Schumacher making me nauseous beyond compare, I like movies like this. However, I usually make an effort to see most Gibson movies, with the Lethal Weapon series being at the top of the heap. So my natural aversion to the so-called `chick flick' kicked it when my wife suggested we watch `What Women Want' on pay per view. This is a good movie.
Nick Marshall (Gibson) is an misogynist advertising executive at Sloan-Curtis, the women he works with despise him for it, and who finds himself turned down for the top marketing job at his firm when it's given to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt...okay, okay, I like her, too!), who is everything to advertising that Nick isn't. And now she has the job that he feels he should have had. And when she announces that the company is missing out on billions of dollars of advertising revenue from women, Nick decides to prove to her that he knows what women want. He does this by waxing his legs, wearing nylons, wearing nail polish in one of the funniest scenes as he all but kills himself in the process. The waxing agony leads to accident that causes him to fall into the bathtub and electrocutes himself with a hair dryer. Being electrocuted in Chicago gives misogynist advertising executives receptive telepathy.
He can hear what women are thinking and this unnerves him. In fact it scares the hell out of him. If the strangers on the way to work was bad, he just isn't prepared for the barrage of hatred from his female coworkers. He goes to see Bette Midler who plays a marriage councillor, who also hates him. He lays it out for her, he knows what women are thinking, then proves it. She explains that he has a gift, and if he knows what women want, he can rule. He begins to play a game- learning how and what women think and using it to get the better of them. All of them, including his estranged daughter. Effortlessly, by listening to their thoughts then formulating his responses based on that, he quickly becomes their best friend, confident and go-to man for advice. He also begins undercutting Darcy's position with their boss. He also notices Erin, an intern who feels that no one notices her and wonders if anyone would notice if she just killed herself.
Things start to fall apart for Nick when he realizes that he cares for Darcy, becomes closer with his daughter and even ingratiates himself to most of the female staff at Sloan-Curtis, even Erin. Nick wants to succeed and get the job that Darcy has, but can't change the fact that he's falling for her big time. She's sweet, honest, down to earth- all the things he hates in women, and she's hooked him. Despite being selfishly motivated, Marshall gets more than he bargained for. `What Women Want' is hilarious, but it's also got some messages that it subtly gets across. Maybe if we said good-bye collectively to the games and [stuff] we play between each other, then perhaps we could get down to what's really important.",1029110400,2,3118,4.589605734767025

Cheer it on with your girlfriends, but spare your boyfriend or husband this ""relationship test"" and watch ""When Harry Met Sally"" instead.
Mel Gibson plays a charming yet chauvanistic man who suddenly finds he has the ability to read women's minds.  At first overwhelmed, Mel uses his gift for his own personal gain, yet gradually he learns to understand and love women, and in the end he is stripped of his undesirable male qualities and falls for the film's ""every-woman"", Helen Hunt.  Gibson's subtle performance provides the only personality in this entire film,  keeping it from becoming a dry, sexist political statement.  This includes a beautiful dance number to Sinatra which recalls Estare and Crosby (this scene was entirely Gibson's idea).  The other performances, including Helen Hunt's, all fall along the lines of ""the universal woman"" vs. ""the universal man.""  Basically, all the women Gibson interacts with are the same woman, just at different stages in her life.  All the men are deceitful, uncaring, or clueless, save for gorgious hunk Gibson who ""changes"".
Fans of this movie might claim that Gibson's highly chauvanistic character lends some balance to the male-bashing, but they fail to realize that healthy men and women are offended by both.  Consider: not only does this film's ""perfect man"" look like Mel Gibson, but he can read minds as well.  Not even the real Mel Gibson can meet those standards.  The ""romantic"" ending of this film has Gibson kissing the heroine right after she fires him.  Our hero.

Gibson then goes to visit some girl and some stuff falls on him.  After that he can hear what women are thinking and that turns his life around.

1272962,2,B00003CXQS,"I didn't like What Women Want very much, but it's only fair to say that this boxoffice hit entertained a lot of moviegoers, as well as a number of critics. Sometimes a reviewer, like anybody else, finds himself at odds with the majority. Because my opinions are published months after a movie's initial release, I at least know when mine is a minority voice.
What Women Want is a satirical romantic comedy about a guy named Nick [Mel Gibson] who discovers he can read women's minds. This occurs after a night during which Nick, attired in panty hose, slips and falls, along with the hairdryer he is holding, into a bathtub full of water. [You'll have to see the movie to find out why he is dressed the way he is.] Stunned by a mighty electric shock, he passes out. His new psychic ability is revealed to him the following morning.
Nick is a hot commodity at a big advertising agency. He is quite the charmer, but he treats women like objects. Now that he can hear their thoughts, however, he learns that - surprise! - many women are rational, intelligent beings. He quickly learns that his ex-wife thinks he's an idiot, his daughter thinks he is a lousy father, and at work, the girls' opinions range from indifference to outrage. To make matters worse, his new boss, Darcy [Helen Hunt], now has the position he thinks he should have been given. People rarely change overnight, so the conniving Nick decides to use his new talent to his own advantage. He will use it to seduce women and to get Darcy's job by artfully stealing her ideas and making them his own. Too bad for Nick that he also finds Darcy so attractive.
What Women Want is Gibson's first romantic comedy in nearly a decade. Ms. Hunt had a much better role as a woman who reforms a man in As Good as it Gets. Marisa Tomei and Bette Midler are very effective in small parts. The best character is Nick's daughter Alexandra, who is undergoing major teen angst. Ashley Johnson does a remarkable job of playing her.
Why did I have problems with the movie? In part, it's because producer and director Nancy Myers, whose work [Father of the Bride, The Parent Trap, I Love Trouble] I've never cared much for, is in charge of a story idea that seems to be too clever for her abilities. Also, with a woman at the helm, you might expect that the female characters would think some interesting thoughts. Sadly, what these women have on their minds is so stereotypical and mundane that we wind up learning nothing new about what women want. Certainly some of the thoughts are hysterically funny, but I anticipated at least one or two fresh insights. Lastly, What Women Want is way too long. There is a silly pseudo-Freudian flashback used to explain why Nick is the way he is with women. It's unnecessary and pointless, as is a subplot concerning Nick and a female file clerk who thinks everyone ignores her. These scenes take up twenty minutes, explain nothing, and worst of all, aren't the least bit funny. Of course, several million viewers might disagree with me.",1016236800,,3019,4.582255083179297

I must say I was slightly disappointed...  but only slightly.  It is a very funny movie.  Mel plays Nick, a shallow womanizer who suddenly has the ability to hear what females are thinking (all females, including dogs).  Nick, while a basically decent sort of guy, is not altogether likeable, especially if you have strong values about feminism.  Mel's portrayal is excellent, especially during scenes of outrageousness (like the scenes where he tries the feminine products).  But, his character is too superficial to feel for.  Helen Hunt's character Darcy, on the other hand, is real and down to earth, and very likeable.  There is one poignant moment when Nick uses his ""gift"" to help a girl who might commit suicide.  If there were more moments like this in the film, it would have been much more substantial and enjoyable movie.  There was one whole area of the film that made no sense to me -- there's a girl in a coffee shop with whom Nick had always flirted... she had always made it clear that she was interested... but, only after Nick gets his new ability does he ask her out.  But, he's too preoccupied with Darcy to take their relationship seriously.  I was left thinking, ""What was the point of that?""

The one drawback is his character's relationship with Marisa Tomei - his treatment of her never loses its swinish vestiges.  But then again, her character turns out to be just a wee bit immature & self-indulgent (""a little more to the left,"" ""the whole tongue at once"" --- that sort of thing, not direct quotes, but watch the movie and you'll get my drift).

1273033,4,B00003CXQS,"A prime example of how good casting can redeem an insipid plot idea.  Mel Gibson is a senior executive in an advertising agency.  Not senior enough for his ambitions, however.  He aims for a loftier position, but is displaced by a new arrival pirated from another agency.  Helen Hunt enters with all the conflicting emotions of the new hire but seasoned professional.  Hunt perfectly assumes the stereotyped role of today's woman manager.  She's lovely, she's assertive, she's vulnerable, but keeps it hidden, and, of course, she's recently divorced.  Her assumption of the Director's post reflects the agency's need to reach the women's market.  Gibson is unable to achieve that because he's more interested in bedding women than selling to them.  He's not aware of what women want.
His awareness expands with a jolt - an electric jolt that provides him with the ability to receive women's thoughts [Do women really operate on a different mental wavelength?  A dangerous proposition to consider these days.].  Confused with the inundation of information, often about himself, Gibson turns his new abilities to discredit Hunt.  Corporate ambition knows no limits and he undercuts her role using this rather blunt instrument.  His own emotions crowd his intent to gain the Directorship, however.  This is inevitable in a romantic fantasy-comedy.  The finale is also inevitable, but carried off with the panache Hunt and Gibson bring to this story.
There's little novelty in this film, but the stunning performances overcome that limitation.  Besides Gibson, who can assume nearly any role cloak and Hunt, whose abilities almost transcend criticism, the film is nearly stolen away by Ashley Johnson.  As Gibson's teenage daughter, she parachutes into his already complicated life while her mother honeymoons. The father-daughter conflicts and stresses parade through the film, but Johnson brings a special, subtle sensitivity to the role.  Alan Alda as the ad agency's president was an interesting choice.  He conveys a sense of dignity that another actor might fail to impart.
This film is worth a view, if for no other reason than seeing Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson in yet another guise.  Whether it's worth repetitive watching is another question.  Unless you're a die-hard Gibson or Hunt fan, once may be enough.  Johnson may be an actress to watch and future roles may suggest coming back to this one as she develops.  At this point, a single viewing was enough.",1011484800,2,2463,5.148614609571789
1273034,3,B00003CXQS,"What Women Want (2000) dir. Nancy Meyers
I'm glad to discover a woman directed it, for she ought to know what women want.
A Mel Gibson vehicle. Also a Helen Hunt vehicle. Also a vehicle for the numerous women in the film. Also a vehicle for men whose obscure mental processes don't know what women want.
An interesting premise: through an accident (a near electrocution), Gibson's mind acquires the ability to hear women's thoughts. At first this puzzles him, enervates him, and he is left clueless as to what to do. He is insulted to hear the vile things women think about him. He thinks this is a curse, not a gift. Soon, however, a therapist (Bette Middler) suggests that he take advantage of this unexpected talent--and become a mind reader. He steals an idea from his boss (Helen Hunt) about an advertising campaign--and he gets a big job while she is fired.
They begin a romance, of course. Gibson also has trouble with his teenage daughter (Ashley Johnson), but through mind reading their relations smooth. He also has a girl friend, Lola (Marisa Tomei), reads her mind, knows she wants sex with him; he has sex with her, and of course also with Hunt (whose first name is Darcy), for she too desires him. Eventually, through another near electrocution, he becomes cured of this aberration--and normal again. Now he is happy, having secured Hunt's job again, having gotten rid of Lola, and reconciled himself with his daughter--who thinks him a caring parent now.
No a bad premise, but a pretty ordinary story comes out of it. It would have been more interesting if Gibson and Hunt engaged in a battle of wits (or battles of the sexes) as Beatrice and Benedict do in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. This actually starts when Marshall steals an idea from McGuire's head; it would have been interesting if she had understood his game and exposed him. By remaining ignorant, she plays the game at a disadvantage, and her status in the story is reduced. In other words, both Hunt and Gibson play a more or less dumb plot--and roles. The script, clever up to a point, falls back into the trodden paths--romantic plots--and loses whatever punch it had. It reduces two competent actors (not to mention some of the others in the ensemble cast) to repeating worn out trivialities instead of engaging them in a truly ingenious contest of mind and feeling.
This role is especially painful for Gibson, who looks older (he is) and capable of going beyond the trivial roles that his profession imposes upon him. After Braveheart (so-so to me), the masculine monster of the Lethal Weapon series, and, above, all the two movies he made with Australian auteur Peter Weir--Galipolli and The Year of Living Dangerously--this movie is a fall-off in status. Helen Hunt, too, is reduced to unintelligence, though she manages a slithering sexiness and a presence that only a mature actress can project. Overall, though, this is not as much a bad movie as a lost opportunity. Actors, like everyone else, age, and their glory passes.",1010707200,,3020,4.809615384615385
1273111,2,B00003CXQS,"First off let me say that I've always liked Mel Gibson ever since I saw Gallipolli. I loved The Year Of Living Dangerously, Maverick, Ransom, the Lethal Weapon series, Conspiracy Theory, even some of his less successful movies such as Mrs Soffel, The Bounty, Hamlet and The River. I think he is a fine, often underused and under-rated actor. I also really like Helen Hunt. However, this is the point where I say BUT (and this is the point where most people reading this review will move to the bottom of my review and click on no) I think this is up there with Air America as one of the worst movies Mel Gibson has ever made. I just thought it was dull, uninspired, unimaginative and worse still, clichd.
If you want a movie that perpetuates the myth that all men are male chauvinist pigs (I thought that idea went out with the 80's)then this is the one for you. Mel Gibson who regularly tops polls as the man all women want, stars here as an advertising executive (Nick) in this unimaginative, high concept low inteliigence movie about a man who can hear what women are thinking and discovers they don't all love him as much as he believed.
 Essentially this is a romantic comedy with the plot centring around Nick's attempts to undermine his new boss (Helen Hunt) when she gets the job and the promotion he thought were his. Using his ability to read her thoughts, he steals her ideas and just as his plan is beginning to work, would you believe it he falls in love with her and develops a conscience? Not exactly the most inspired, original or imaginative plot twist me thinks.
To my mind this was a movie with a good premise and it could have been a good movie had they avoided the schmaltz and the stereotypes. They didn't. It's not all bad though, Mel Gibson is his usual charming self and Helen Hunt makes a sympathetic, intelligent and attractive love interest, even if the lighting throughout this movie does her no favours. The movie does have some good moments but if you've seen the promotional ad's you've pretty much seen all the best bits. I hope this review doesn't come over as a male taking offence to a bit of male bashing. I just think this was a missed opportunity.",1010620800,,2186,4.492462311557789

There isn't really any great insights here and Gibson's move from shallow to sensitive is a bit contrived.  Hunt is a great actress but this film is kind of waste of her talent.

1273178,2,B00003CXQS,"I knew I was not going to be watching Doctor Zhivago when I checked this DVD out of the local library, but I thought, with Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt involved (as well as Alan Alda and a wonderful Marisa Tomei in  supporting roles), the story would make some sense whatsoever, or at least be mildly amusing.  What a waste.
This film cannot decide whether it wants to be an aburdist comedy, a ""Working Girl"" like tale of a woman rising to the top in a man's business world, or a love story involving the two lead characters.  They also throw in a little rebellious daughter v. overprotective father stuff for good measure.  At various times in the movie, it tries to do all of the above, none very well mind you, only to abandon the premise in favor of something else.
Mel Gibson is a successful, cocky, chauvinist advertising executive in line for a promotion by his boss Alan Alda.  On the day he is supposedly destined for glory, Alda pulls an about face and hires outsider Helen Hunt for the promotion, who was recently fired from her job at a competing agency, despite her supposedly great marketing ideas for targeting women consumers.  There follows a rather predictable effort at sabotage by Mel, while (equally predictably) he starts falling for his new boss Hunt at the same time he pities her.
Within this fairly unexciting plotline the writers have thrown a bizarre twist, namely that Gibson, who receives a shock in his bathtub, can now hear the secret thoughts of all women around him.  One horrible scene involves Gibson walking through a department store, I think it was the prefume section, and being literally tortured by the bombardment of thoughts assailing him from all females present.  After they believe this joke wears a little thin, (and believe me it does), the writers just basically abandon the premise!
By the conclusion you just want this dog to end, since many reviewers here rightly pointed out the movie is about thirty minutes too long.  I liked the scenes with quirky Marisa Tomei, an aspiring actress who works in a coffee bar and worries about the impending loss of her looks, but Mel (and the writers) drop Marisa like a dirty shirt about halfway through the film. Gibson ends up being, at least with Tomei, exactly the kind of chauvinist jerk they are trying to convince you he is not.  You have to admire Gibson's willingness to take risks and change gears every now and then, making a film like this in favor of yet another Braveheart/Patriot clone.  However if you still want to watch What Women Want, by all means rent this movie, you won't want to sit through it more than once.",1001030400,,2621,4.651515151515151

Mel Gibson stars as an adman who receives the ability to read women's minds after getting electrocuted in his bathroom by falling in the tub with a hair dryer. Yeah, it could happen. Sure. Predictably, Mel starts to use it to his advantage. Would you?. He uses it on his new co-worker played by Helen Hunt. After a while, he realizes he's using his newfound powers for the wrong reasons. He also makes Helen's character lose her job. Of course, there's romance between the two. How could there not be?. The movie takes a more serious turn as Mel starts feeling pressure from hearing things he really doesn't want to hear, including a co-worker who he thinks wants to kill herself. The film could of done without that part. Again, the movie isn't bad. It could've been funnier and a lot shorter. Mel Gibson is very good in this. Helen Hunt has little to do here.

The idea of a chauvinistic, womanising man getting electrocuted and then magically living through the ordeal only to be able to read the minds of all women he encounters... in his dreams. A man this callous and shallow would not use this power to become a gentler, more sensitive man. He would use it to get exactly what he wanted. Sure, his character does exploit his new gift to an extent, but of course, the end is just picture-perfect because he has become so sensitive and soft-hearted that he can practically read the mind of leading lady Helen Hunt even without his improbable skill.

1273196,2,B00003CXQS,"**1/2  In What Women Want, Mel Gibson plays an ad exec so misogynistic in his outlook that he makes Henry Higgins look like Richard Simmons.  A confirmed bachelor, he basically sees women as little more than sex objects to be wooed, made love to and discarded at his own convenience and pleasure.  Suddenly one day a freak accident occurs, allowing Nick the ability to overhear what women are thinking.  First he is stunned to discover that many of the women around him find him to be a crass, obnoxious male chauvinist.  Then he realizes that knowing what women want beforehand might come in very handy in helping him in his conquests.  Finally, he comes to empathize with the struggles women face in their lives, particularly having to deal with boorish oafs like him.
Like most movies based on a gimmick, What Women Want offers both good and bad elements in about equal measure.  On the positive side, the gimmick itself is a clever one  as long as it remains fresh that is.  Its fun watching Nick get his comeuppance as he comes to learn that what he thinks is attractive behavior to women is actually the very thing that turns many of them off.  However, as is usually the case in these films, the gimmick eventually begins to wear thin, and when Nick starts going the reform route, becoming, in effect, a sensitive man, the film loses its satirical bite and becomes soft and squishy.  (Actually, this theme was explored to much sharper and more hilarious effect in Tootsie almost 20 years ago).  This kind of plotting was a staple in the TV series Bewitched, but there it was forced to wrap itself up in less than 30 minutes, thus avoiding the problem of diminishing returns.  This film, which runs a needlessly long 126 minutes, ends up exhausting the possibilities of the premise quite early on.  We always know where the story is headed so we simply wait around for the events to play themselves out.  Moreover, the filmmakers want to cover far more ground than they are able to in one film.  Time and again, we find ourselves deflected from the core element of the film  Nicks romance with a fellow advertiser played by the always wonderful Helen Hunt  by side forays involving his teenaged daughter, a coffee shop employee, and even a suicidal clerk at his office.  I suppose this is an admirable attempt to give a fuller dimension to Nicks life and character, but the strands are never very fully developed and they end up attenuating the romance at the films core.
Gibson does a very fine job parodying his macho tough-guy image and Helen Hunt brings her unique glow to a woman who, though she finds herself at the top of the corporate world, still yearns for the peace and serenity that only a life of casual simplicity can bring.  In an amusing casting coup, Alan Alda, long associated with sensitive man roles in the 1970s and 80s, appears as Nicks boss.

The relationships with the women in his life are distant and unhealthy, until one night,after a splendid dance number, an accident with a hairdryer, which takes place in time to a well-orchestrated waltz, changes his life. After the electric shock renders him able to hear women's thoughts, he finds himself at a loss, realizing how much he is resented by the opposite sex, but takes advantage of his new boss, Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt whose natural beauty, wit, and intelligence make her the perfect foil for Gibson, and of a lonely coffee shop clerk played with pathos by Marisa Tomei. The scene in which he spends an ilicit evening with Tomei's character, Lola, is a hilarious one in which Gibson once more displays the powerfully muscular physique that could have inspired Michaelangelo's ""David"". In contrast, the scenes where he hams it up on an outing with his long-neglected daughter, Alex, played by a doll-faced but fashionable-looking Ashley Johnson, are a bit more poignant when at one point, his fatherly pride stands revealed on his face. Of all the females whose minds he is able to read, it is the stinging evaluation of his teenage daughter, whose boyfriend treats women the same way he does, that wounds Nick Marshall the most. Alan Alda's role as Nick's equally chauvinistic mentor is an ironic one, given Alda's well-known real-life support of women's issues. Mark Feurstein is funny as Nick's protege who becomes baffled by his mentor's chane of heart. We can't write Nick off completely because his new found ability gradually makes him a better person, even compelling him to personally reconcile with a spurned employee with a suicidal bent, and sparing the feelings of a former fling, even though he resorts to lying. Darcy Maguire is strong enough to appropriately penalize Nick for using her. But in Movieland, there are few women whom the spreading of Gibson's lazily-formed, sharp-cornered Cupid's Bow mouth into a dazzling smile can't disarm. Lauren Holly, and Bette Midler as Nick's ex-wife and ex-marriage counselor, and Valerie Perrine and Delta Burke as Nick's mindless office mannequins provide intersting counterparts.

MY REVIEW:
""Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt do a great job playing two enemies who end up falling in love.  There are some hilarious scenes, but the rest mostly goes to the elderly folk style humor.  Ages 35+ will get a kick out of this movie!  But for those of us under that age, you will find that for the most part, this movie is great fun, but there are those points of the film that are just blank, and have no appeal to a younger audience.
Yet, overall, the film is pretty good.  There is no doubt that this movie is funny, but it seems to have been meant, mostly for women, of course, and an older audience.  Other films for those of you who liked this one might enjoy-- YOU'VE GOT MAIL, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS and AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS.  Check this fun film out for a good laugh.""

Some screen pairings don't always click but this one does in the old tradition of screen lovers like Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn (""Bringing Up Baby"") or Myrna Loy and William Powell(""The Thin Man"").  The story is a trifle, the production values are first rate, the music is seductive (check out the soundtrack)and the fact that you really do fall in love with both Mel and Helen is strange but true.

1273263,4,B00003CXQS,"He has the power to hear everything women are saying. Finally?a man is listening."" Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt star in this romantic comedy about a male chauvinist pig (Gibson as Nick Marshall) given the opportunity to read women's minds. Hunt is Darcy Maguire, an advertising executive with a rotten reputation who gets hired as the new Creative Director - a position Nick was already uncorking the champagne to celebrate landing. Nick is as politically incorrect as they come. He insults women, tells offensive chauvinistic jokes, and generally goes out of his way to offend the opposite sex. Passed over for a promotion and determined to undermine his new female boss's efforts, Nick schemes to outshine and outwit (that sounds a bit ?Survivor?-ish) Darcy, hoping to send her back into the ranks of the unemployed. Mel Gibson's take on Nick as both a throwback to men of the 1940's, and as the enlightened man of the current millennium, is right on target. He plays both angles of Nick's personality with good humor and style. Gibson carries the film with Hunt and the rest of the cast seeming to enjoy being along for the ride. Not that Hunt, Mark Feuerstein (as sidekick and co-worker, Morgan), and Alan Alda as the head honcho of the advertising firm, aren't competent in their roles; it's more that their roles seem to be overshadowed by Mel's presence. The only co-star who seems to rival Mel's presence is Marisa Tomei. Tomei portrays a coffee shop clerk, and constant object of Mel's attention. Tomei brings a bubbly, effervescent life to her character and the chemistry between she and Mel is enjoyable to witness. Overall, What Women Want is a bit predictable, a bit corny, but worthwhile viewing - especially if you're a Mel Gibson fan. But all in all its a fun affair.

Nick is jealous and sets out to prove that he does understand women, but only with the aid of a supernatural gift that allows him to hear women's thoughts.
This is a different role for Gibson unlike the tough guy image he usually portrays.

1273321,4,B00003CXQS,"The basic premise for this movie - a man that gains the power to read women's minds - is such an obvious plotline that I can't believe there aren't a dozen movies out there like it.  Mel Gibson's character is the ""lucky"" recipient of this power.  At first he can't deal with it, but soon learns (after a chat with Bette Midler as a psychiatrist in a juicy cameo) he can use the power to become great in bed, patch things up with his daughter, and undercut his new boss (who ""stole"" his promotion), played by Helen Hunt.
It's true that the characters are a little thin and two-dimensional, but who cares?  You don't watch a movie like this for deep meaning, who watch because it's fun, energetic, and funny, much like the old Cary Grant comedies.
Overall the performances in this film are excellent.  Mel has a lot of fun with the role, that of a misogynist ad executive that eventually learns to become a new age sensitive guy.  Hunt is good as well, starting off as a foil who eventually falls in love with him; their romantic chemistry is very good.  Marissa Tomei's aspiring actress who is seduced by Gibson is the worst of the two-dimensional characters (not her fault, she does her best with the material), while the best supporting character is the suicidal clerk played by Judy Greer.  The interaction between Gibson's executive and the clerk is the turning point in the exec's transformation between jerk and good guy.
There are a few extras on the DVD.  There are two ""making of"" featurettes, one of which is in the irritating ""extended trailer"" style that I hate, but the other is interesting, if short, and includes some interview clips with the actors talking about working with the other members of the cast and crew.  The commentary by director Meyers (along with the production designer, but he doesn't say much) is interesting as it ranges over a wide variety of topics, including the actors, the sets, and technical details like audio dubbing.

1273322,4,B00003CXQS,"This movie is surprisingly charming, given the fact that critics pilloried it when it first came out. All I can say is that Mel Gibson still has what it takes to be a leading man in a romantic comedy.
The movie certainly opens promisingly enough with a hilarious sneak preview into the childhood of the main character, Nick, a top advertising agency executive that Mel Gibson plays with great aplomb. Nick is a divorced, male chauvinist who thinks that he is God's gift to women. Unfortunately, as so many men of this type are, he is dead wrong. He is just a man's man who thinks that he is a ladies' man.
He begins to get his comeuppance when the coveted job of Creative Director, to which he is expecting to be promoted, is offered to someone outside the agency, another advertising whiz named Darcie, affectingly played by Helen Hunt. She gets the job, rather than he, so that the agency might be better able to  tap into the women's market. She is now his new boss, and Nick is not happy.
After their first meeting, the disgruntled Nick goes home and drinks himself into a stupor. Look for the wonderful dance routine done in best Fred Astaire style. It is a charming salute to an all time great. While in his inebriated state, however, Nick has a shocking accident (pun intended) that enables him to be able to read women's minds.
This ability causes him some distress, as he is amazed to find out what women really think of him, and it is not always flattering. It also enables him to please women as never before, as he is able to read their innermost thoughts and anticipate their needs. It even helps him repair his relationship with his fifteen year old daughter who is undergoing teenage angst.
He uses this ability, however, to trump Darcie, unbeknownst to her, as he has every intention of getting the job he coveted. What he does not anticipate is falling in love with her. This certainly puts a kink into his plans. The question is whether love will triumph. Watch the movie and find out.
The contrivance of being able to read women's minds creates some very funny scenes and interesting situations. It also allows Nick's character to grow as a person and become more three dimensional. There is a strong supporting cast that includes Delta Burke, Marisa Tomei, and an unbilled cameo by by Bette Midler.

He is divorced, has a distant relationship with his teenage daughter and is only interested in what HE wants.  He expects to get a promotion in the advertising agency where he works, but instead a woman (Helen Hunt) is hired to fill the spot.  Mel decides that he will do whatever he can to undermine her and reclaim the job that he thinks is rightfully his.  He is challenged by his new boss to come up with an ad campaign for a variety of female products. Because he is so out of touch with his female side, he decides to try out some of the products.  When his daughter and her boyfriend arrive at his apartment he is decked out in pantyhose, nail polish, and a wonderbra (Braveheart in a bra?  What a concept.)  A freak accident with a hair dryer occurs, he is electrocuted, and is suddenly able to read women's minds.  As if this isn't a hard enough concept to swallow, this sudden insight into women's minds turns him into a caring, sensitive man.  He patches up his relationships with his daughter and all the women around him.  The whole idea was so far out that I had difficulty enjoying any comedy or romance which occurred.

This had all the makings of a truly fun comedy, and there are great actors in this movie, but it just doesn't satisfy.  Perhaps if I had known going in that this movie was a drama, I would have appreciated it more, but this is a movie in search of a theme.  Also, Mel Gibson's character is hard to like as he first is a chauvanist, then uses his gift to manipulate people, then finally reforms.

1273352,5,B00003CXQS,"I actually waited until I was able to pick this up in my public library to see it.  The bad word on it was incredible so I'd been avoiding it. I figured hubby wouldn't last at all through it if even I was skeptical about it.  I said my famous opening line to him to get him to watch it, ""Let's just give it the 15 minute test.  If it's not even good for that, we'll go onto something else.""  The opening was quite good about the male lead's childhood and I said, ""Gee, usually films aren't real bad with that good an opening.""  (When they open with endless minutes of driving around with credits superimposed over the driving, I know that I'm usually in for a real bad time, by contrast.) Fifteen minutes into this film, we were both equally charmed by it and Mel Gibson, whose talent as a romantic lead is not dimmed by age.  Every fifteen minutes one or the other of us muttered about how had this gotten such bad reviews.

I had heard Gibson was too old for this role too.  That is not true either and he is a lot younger than Cary Grant was when he bowled everyone over romantically in ""North By Northwest.""  Both hubby and I were also thinking back to the romantic comedies of decades ago and were delighted to see its resurrection here.  Need I say this had Doris Day and Rock Hudson type charm?  I guess I better and remind viewers that ""Pillow Talk"" and ""Lover Come Back"" were huge, engaging hits with similar material.  The gist of the story is that top ad man Gibson does not get the top job at his agency because it goes to Helen Hunt.  He gets the ability to read women's minds by accident and schemes to get Hunt's job with this newest gift.  He starts falling in love with Hunt though as he steals her ad ideas right out of her head. He has a brief patient-shrink visit with Bette Midler and one of his funniest bits is finding out that women really think he is an incredible jerk! He didn't have a clue, thinking that he was God's gift to women instead.

Gibson has some solo moments in the movie which are just great.  He tries on all of a woman's cosmetic products at home one night to learn how to sell them.  This was hilarious, especially watching him wriggle into panty hose.  He also dances with a hat rack a la Fred Astaire and is surprisingly good at it.  This film was directed by a woman, Nancy Meyers, and we both thought that showed in the best sense possible as it was a pleasure to see Gibson not being beaten up or used as action-adventure fodder for a change.  In fact, I haven't enjoyed seeing him in a movie this much in a long, long time and I can remember back to seeing him in his original ""Mad Max"" movie in the 1970s when it opened in the USA and loving it and seeing him in ""Tim"" shortly after that and loving that too.  Helen Hunt does a very solid job here too as the female lead but it is obviously a lesser part to Gibson's starring role.  They have very good chemistry together.

1273353,3,B00003CXQS,"Movie Summary:  Man's man Nick Marshall doesn't understand women. Oh like all men he thinks he does, but he doesn't. Nick's life isn't so hot. He's never had a good relationship with any of the women in his life including his 15 year old daughter. But Nick Marshall is going to get the opportunity to change all that. One evening while waxing his legs, trying out mascara and hair mouse, Nick gets the shock of his life. He wakes up with the ability to hear women's thoughts. Now Nick can either learn from his new gift, or use it for his own selfish reasons.
My Opinion:  This movie looks so good. The premise of Mel Gibson hearing the thoughts of women is really intriguing. The trailers are awesome. It's even really funny and interesting in the film. Until they have to wrap everything up and end the movie. That's when everything falls apart. The ending is terribly weak. It steals all the energy and laughter that it had going up until that point. It takes what should have been a really fun and entertaining movie and leaves it flat. It's still very much worth seeing once, but it could very easily have been lots better; a classic even. It's that disappointment that stayed with me after the film ended.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic. Extras include trailers, commentary, and documentaries. Both sound and video were pretty good.
What You Should Do:  Rent it. Mel makes it good enough to watch once, but not twice.",991872000,7,1428,4.632411067193676
1273354,4,B00003CXQS,"Clearly what women want is as much Mel Gibson as they can get.  This combination comedy and love story starts smartly, but unravels when the love story attempts to take itself seriously.  However, that didn't keep the film from topping $200 Million worldwide at the box office.
Nick Marshall is a ""man's man"", a self-absorbed chauvinist who has little respect for women.  When his big promotion is given to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), Nick plots for a way to bring her down.  In the course of trying out women's products to get ""the female perspective"", he accidentally electrocutes himself, giving himself the power to read women's minds.  Though highly contrived (why only women's thoughts?), the comedic gimmick is novel and produces numerous hilarious moments.  Nick decides he is going to use his special powers to undermine Darcy in her position and seduce her in the process.  Predictably, they fall in love, which leads to a soulless, but schmaltzy romance that throws a cold bucket of water on the merriment.
Director Nancy Meyers has written a number of successful lightweight comedies (""Private Benjamin"", ""Father of the Bride"", ""The Parent Trap""), often teaming with her husband, director Charles Shyer.  This is her second directorial project after ""The Parent Trap"" and is by far the most ambitious project she has undertaken.  It is clear here that comedy is her strong suit.  The comedy bits are well done and the gimmick is liberally explored with good results.  In contrast, the romance is stilted and unnatural (due in part to the abysmal chemistry between Gibson and Hunt) and Meyers doesn't know when to quit, pouring it on ad nauseam.
Mel Gibson is the right actor for the comedy and the wrong actor for the romance.  He has always done well at wry macho comedy (See Lethal Weapon 1-4), but when it comes to romance, he's a dud.  Though intoxicating to the female eye, Gibson is all thumbs when it comes to sensitive and sentimental interchanges.  Like Nick, Gibson is a ""man's man"" and he is unable to bring the character to the proper transition.
Helen Hunt often reminds me of Jody Foster in that she seems like a man trapped in a woman's body.  However, unlike Foster, Hunt doesn't seem comfortable in that prison and always comes across as if she is having a gender crisis.  Whereas Foster is an electrifying actor who is obviously at ease with her no-bull personality, Hunt feels compelled to force out her sensitive side, making her constantly appear awkward and unnatural.  This disconnect is particularly grating here, especially given Gibson's handicap in the sentimentality department.  The one compensation is that Hunt's deadpan seriousness is a comedic asset in her role as straight-woman (which is one of the primary reasons ""Mad About You"" succeeded on TV).
Once again, Marisa Tomei proves that she is one of the most underrated actors in film with a show stopping performance as Lola.  I have often wondered why she doesn't get meatier roles.  She has mostly been relegated to quirky character roles, where she invariably outshines the leads.  Her confrontation with Nick here is one of the highlights of the film.
This film is easy to like.  It can be forgiven its abortive attempt at matchmaking between Gibson and Hunt simply because the comedy bits are so funny.  I rated it a 7/10.  If Meyer had kept the romance light and lively, it could have been much better.",991440000,,3406,4.893728222996516

It is pretty funny (READ: Mel Gibson in panty hose and fingernail polish dancing to woman-power-I-have-many-sides-to-me-which-must-be-honored music).

Don't expect the kind of ""in your face"" action that might normally expect from Mel Gibson.  Do expect an endearing Helen Hunt.  Together, their on-screen personas mix well for an enjoyable couple of hours of laughter.  The sad part of this movie for us guys is... we really can't deny that Mel is acting just the way we too often are!  Sorry about that, ladies...
Mel Gibson begins the movie as the stereotypical ""guy"" - not sensitive and with only ""one"" thing in mind.  Not a good father.  Been a bad husband.  All his relationships are pretty one-sided.  Enter electricity and a bit of movie magic.  The balance of the movie shows what a bit of sensitivity can do for those prickly interpersonal relationships.  There's a message here somewhere...  Mel Gibson does a good job with comedy during his actions flicks; he does a fine job carrying that same sense of humor into a love story.  And if you've never seen him do a bit of soft-shoe and dance with a hat tree...

1273405,3,B00003CXQS,"""What Women Want"" tells the story of a man who thinks he's God's gift to women, until he receives a little gift of his own: the ability to hear what women think. The movie stars Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, both of whom give excellent performances and have a unique chemistry which is not explosive but still convincing. The movie has everything going for it, but the third act fizzles out and the laughs die too quickly, which takes away from the luster of the genuinely funny scenes in the beginning and mid- sections.
Gibson was the ideal choice for Nick Marshall, a hotshot advertising executive whose company has just hired Darcy McGuire instead of him as the new creative director. Her approach to boosting sales focuses on marketing products to women, and each of the meeting attendees are given a box full of women's products. As Nick tries out the products in order to get a feel for the ideas Darcy is looking for, a freak accident gives him the unthinkable power of hearing womens' thoughts and feelings.
At first intimidated by his newfound ability, Nick soon gains control over his fear and is able to use it to his advantage, hoping that stealing Darcy's ideas and making them his own will get him the position and her out of the company. But he soon starts falling in love with her, and finds out that what he is doing isn't such a good idea after all, especially when she is fired.
The comedy of the film has a certain sophistication which rises above such comedies as ""American Pie"" or ""Scary Movie."" It never goes into the gross-out category, nor does it push the envelope. Our protagonist, Nick, goes through everything a normal man would avoid: waxing his legs, applying mascara to his eyes, nail polish, and listening to Meredith Brooks' ""Bitch"" while trying on black pantyhose and a push-up bra. His awkwardness in taking on these tasks is absolutely hilarious. More comic relief comes when he hears womens' thoughts, especially that of the guard at his building, who has a hidden attraction for him.
The movie is a subconscious battle of the sexes, with Nick trying to mold himself into what each of the women he comes in contact with wants. The men in the audience will agree with the confusion he goes through as he turns himself into a sex machine for the girl in the coffee shop, while putting on the sensitive charm and man-oriented jokes for the women at work. This is some of Gibson's best work, and his ability to go from emotion to emotion is a testament to that ability and stamina.
His supporting cast includes a lot of well-knowns, most of whom have small cameos. Helen Hunt has all the look, charm and appeal of a real advertising creative director; she's the kind of actress who you could believe in a role like this. Marisa Tomei is a riot in her role as the coffee shop waitress, while Lauren Holly gives a small yet winning performance as Nick's ex-wife. Alan Alda makes an appearance as the head of the company, while Delta Burke and Bette Midler appear as well. This is one of those sparkling casts that shines no matter what the material, and their interactions are natural and make the movie enjoyable.
The only thing preventing this movie is its length, which will certainly have an effect on the overall movie after it ends. The first two thirds of the movie are comedic brilliance, helmed by Gibson, but once the awkwardness of his situation gives way to the budding romance between Nick and Darcy, the movie slows down considerably, dragging out over the course of almost an hour as Nick debates whether or not to tell her about sabotaging her job. The comedy also comes to a halt, and while there are a few laughs left over, the chuckles and side-splitting laughter which comes with earlier moments is lost to the lengthy melodrama.
Still, ""What Women Want"" is a funny movie which does succeed in delivering laughs. Gibson does some of his best comedic work here, and this will be remembered as one of his best roles. Though the film lacks a solid ending, within the overall film lies an intriguing look at the battle of the sexes and how it shapes our lives.",990316800,4,4106,4.610655737704918

Overall, ""What Women Want"" is a very good movie. It has all the makings of a fine romantic comedy; A handsome man, a beautiful woman, and a great deal of conflict. The only real flaw to the film is towards the end when it starts to become a little too heavy and takes itself just a little too seriously. Those are the times when the movie seems to drag and has trouble getting started again.
Gibson and Hunt are actually quite good together, and really have some good on screen chemistry. In addition, the use of Alan Alda, Bette Midler, Delta Burke, and Marisa Tomei in supporting roles is terrific.  The soundtrack is also top notch with a great collection of classic standards by the Chairman of the Board, mixed with a few modern Top 40 tunes.  Gibson really surprises with a small homage to Fred Astaire, and shows that he actually quite light on his feet.
If you haven't seen this yet, then you really should, but I would suggest renting before buying... just in case.",989539200,11,2023,4.44743935309973
1273466,5,B00003CXQS,"I bought this film with a little sense of foreboding. Anybody remember the film ""Zapped"" with Scott Baio? Sir Baio acquires a psychic mind-over-matter capability (i.e. he can blink like Jeanie) and how does he use his powers? Solving world hunger? Saving lives in surgery? Nope, he pops girls blouses off, and the film was shallow enough to spare us the burden of how a real girl would be humiliated, and cry alone in her room while her parents anguished over what was wrong.
Was this movie to be Zapped II?
It was clear early on that something delightful was in store due to the production values, and the subtle almost unnoticeable artful rocking of the camera. The supporting cast was excellent. I mean REALLY excellent.
Mel Gibson initially is definitely a microwave-quick, get-to-the-point, predatory male. Every nuance of the character paints that picture.
When he acquires his Big Trick, the film gets somewhat annoying. In hindsight I think it was smart to annoy the audience at that part of the film since it's clearly a plot twist that is disturbing to the character.
With his new powers, Nick (Mel's character) first tries to use them in a predatory way. This didn't work, and as the film progresses he uses his powers in another way. SWITCHING TACTICS! A character is THINKING if they switch tactics. It is very enjoyable to watch a film with believable characters who come across as ""thinking"".
Also, Nick becomes more of an emotion-based decider, and his mannerisms clearly display that. I have to equate the believability of his new mannerisms with Dustin Hoffman's character growth in Kramer vs Kramer. Further, as Nick understands women better, he exudes a Tom Hanks-like empathy that is very likeable. (Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks in the same paragraph. Mel really shines in this movie.)
I would have done this and that scene a little differently, and this film isn't the end-all best film ever made, but when it was over I had this good feeling, happy I had watched it.
I would call this movie a smart romantic comedy and highly recommend it.",989366400,,2062,4.827683615819209
1273467,2,B00003CXQS,"Mel Gibson should choose better scripts to do. First the Patriot, now this... And testicular cancer is relevant, depending on the temperature of female conversations.  You can see it, but don't go with high expectations.",989280000,,220,5.285714285714286
1273468,4,B00003CXQS,"This is an interesting, entertaining movie that DOES show what woman think or imagine.  On one side it's what we imagine and on the other it's about what we want.  We imagine single men alone in their apartment with a glass of wine entertaining themselves and perhaps musing that they are still single and congratulating themselves that they have avoided the commitment trap and still get what they want.
Mel does a sexy dance with grace.  I was quite surprised that this hard playing action character displayed a vulnerable side.  You will laugh at seeing him in womans nylons in the bathroom while he's trying to figure woman out.
This had to be directed by a woman because I can't see any man actually displaying that sort of depth that does not exist outside of baseball or action films.  Which is one of the points of the film.  He gets to a point where he is more in tuned with his feminine side and avoids more of the hard hitting action on tv. (he does a great impression of Sean Connery)
You often hear men grumbling that they wish they knew what women wanted.  The director gives him and the audience a chance by providing a stream of outspoken thoughts, worries, fear, happiness by women and showing their reactions to being discovered.  Mel was so amazed by what women thought that he drenched himself in a room full of women just to get their perspective.  It was very new to him.  Bette Midler's character took the opportunity.  She became more himself when she realized Mel could hear her thoughts.  A psychiatrist having a toke.  I wonder how many women would be different if men could hear our thoughts.  And isn't Mel Gibson worth wanting.  ;-)
I highly recommend this movie if you are open to looking at both sides and what men can do about vulnerability.",989193600,,1774,4.569620253164557

1273500,2,B00003CXQS,"When I saw the previews for this film I figured it would be a great way to spend two hours.  After I had spent my two hours with Mel and Helen, I wanted them back.
If you have seen any trailer for this film, then you have seen the best and funniest parts.  The ""funny"" scenes in this film were not funny at all.  I understand that this is a romantic comedy and all but, Mel gibson seems awkward throughout the entire movie.  I was upset that Helen Hunt, a woman that performed beautifully in As Good as it Gets, even chose the role in this film.
From the beginning a viewer already knows the outcome of the movie.  We all know that the man's life will change because of this accident.  The concept of hearing what women think, as far-fetched as it is, is interesting.  I only wish someone could have been a little more creative with it.
The movie also goes to great extremes to waste good talent.  Marisa Tomei plays a mindless woman worring about petty things.  Delta Burke plays Gibson's ""yes girl"" and could have given much more to the picture.
I don't expect an epic like Braveheart or an action film like Twister every time these two are on the screen.  I just want something that is entertaining.  The best part of this film goes to the set decorators and designers.

I am the type who likes some mysteries, romantic comedies, cute little movies that entertain me but that do not make me think too much.  This movie accomplished just that.
  I enjoyed watching Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson side by side as they had the kind of chemistry to make a romance feasible.  Mel Gibson's character starts out as the typical ladies man who uses all kinds of lines to get women into bed with him and thinks that he is god's gift to women.  After a life changing experience, he is able to actually hear what women are thinking and it leads him to realize that every woman doesn't want him.  It makes him a little more sensitive in some situations, although he uses this newfound ability to manipulate his new boss.
  I actually found myself laughing out loud at this cute little movie, but it may be funnier when rented on video/DVD.  I'm not sure if I would watch it again and again.

1273503,4,B00003CXQS,"In a movie like this, you expect the two leads to be on-screen all the time, kissing and hugging, with sexy results.  But the director, Nancy Meyers, doesn't go for that kind of trite crap.  She keeps the plot simple, entertaining and above all, touching.
The movie opens with Nick (Mel Gibson) as a sexist, power-hungry man.  He works for an ad agency, where he expects to be promoted.  But unbeknownst to him, they have hired Darcy, a fresh new talent from outside the company (Helen Hunt).  Nick is obviously upset.  Then, a strange thing happens that must be seen to be believed.  Somehow, through electrocution, he is now able to hear the thoughts of all women.  At first he is freaked, then he figures he can use it to his advantage.
All the characters are well developed and the acting is top notch.  Helen Hunt is wonderful as the cocky new executive and Marisa Tomei delivers her best performance since My Cousin Vinny.  The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson is great as well.  However, there is one thing that bothered me about this movie.  There is a small sub-plot with an office intern, Erin, who is always contemplating suicide.  I felt the story was not really carried to completion as well as it could have.

1273506,2,B00003CXQS,"Freud, famously, despaired of discovering what women wanted (perhaps he might have done better to ask women, but that thought was a little too left-field for him). What a shame he flourished in the wrong century, for otherwise he would have discovered courtesy of this finely untuned film. The answer to what women what is: well, actually the question is phrased wrongly. The question we should be asking is: what do Nike want women to want? And the answer, of course, is: Nike sportswear. Easy!
Never has product placement been more shameless. And never has Helen Hunt seemed more at sea, which isn't her fault as she has an impossible role: the women who outsmarts the man with every single possible advantageous loading the film can get him. Even his flaws work in his favour: thus he's the ultimate womaniser yet - and this is a tad strange, you might think - has a sexual technique that would make a rhino look leisurely. This is the big brother of the 'ha, you may have ruined our lives but you have small genitals' school of writing, in which all patriarchal power is pretty much left in place, apart from a small genital gag which somehow makes everything all right. Anyway, Marisa Tomei cures Mel of his rhinoceros loving, and after that... Well, nothing much really. He pays attention to his daughter, he falls in the least convincing love to hit our screens for a few weeks, and he stops a geek-slash-wallflower from killing herself. Our hero!
But the main point of the film: he gives a really cool presentation to the Nike team, about the forthcoming campaign which is shown in all its virtuosity. You know, it used to be that if you timed it right you could reach your cinema seat just as the adverts ended and the trailers began. But no more.

Great idea though: what if a guy could read the thoughts of all women around him?  Make it into a romantic comedy with a guy who's self absorbed and disinterested in other women.  In the end, he realizes his errors.

GOOD POINTS:

(1) Some funny scenes;

(2) famous cast and supporting cast; Helen Hunt, Mel Gibson, Marisa Tomei, girl known as LISA from JACK AND JILL TV show; Alan Alda from the MASH TV series; etc.

(3) a few interesting insight in to women;

(4) fairly good chemistry between Gibson and HH;

(5) some cool gag scenes;

(6) storyline was good but not great or superb

WHAT I DID NOT LIKE

(1) No enduring theme; too simple like candy for a day;

(2) the character arc changes for Gibson aren't believable; he changes to fit the needs of the story rather than there being strong, persuasive elements for his change;

(3) would have been truer and more interesting if a minor subplot wasn't resolved for the better.  In this story, everyone was happy and come on, differences between the sexes are hard choices to negotiate.  The film does the issue a disservice by resolving everything like cotton candy.

(4) There's so much Gibson's character could have done with his talent but we only saw part of it.  Sort of like watching someone drive a porsche in a 25MPH zone to pick up food at the local grocery store.  Yet, we never see its full potential b/c it's never taken out on the freeway.

So, overall, good movie if you want something light.  Nothing deep or hidden deeply in the film to give it resonance in later years.  If you can deal with that, check it out.

Mel Gibson has great presence but it is wasted here as he acts confused and stutters his lines in a script that portrays most men as thoughtless nitwits. His transformation to telepathy is stupid and appears to have been dreamed up over a coffee break. Helen Hunt is no better and constantly looks as if she is ready to cry her beady little eyes out.  Marisa Tomei! This beautiful talented actress who won an academy award is given a bit part as a brainless bimbo! She needs to fire her agent. Mels daughter is supposed to be a sympathetic character but comes across as a snotty brat until her {you guessed it} creep of a boyfriend dumps her.  The only subplot that interested me was of the hard working but overlooked and ignored go-fer. I don't recall her name but the scenes with her and Mel were the best part of this movie.

1273542,1,B00003CXQS,"I didn't expect much from this movie and ""much"" is something that we do not get. I was kind of interested by the trailer at the concept of mind reading but like UNBREAKABLE there is not enough of it.
The plot is schmaltzy and clichd and is presented in the most boring and unoriginal way. Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, an executive at an advertising company (lead characters in these type of comedies are always high-fliers, think of Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, Tim Robbins in Nothing To Lose, Anne Heche in Six Days Seven Nights or even Nic Cage in Family Man) who is very male-chauvinistic and is generally disliked by women. Then one night he is electrocuted in the bath while wearing panties and make-up, he wakes up the next morning with the ability to hear women's thoughts.
This could have been cool but in a 127 minute movie (overlong) there is a window of about 40 minutes in which Mel is able to read minds and only 10 minutes of that is devoted to actually doing it. What a waste, it turns the movie into a totally pointless experience. If it had been different, if the main characters were younger, didn't have the clichd ""high-flier"" jobs or if the plot had more on it's mind than a man and a woman falling in love there could have been a cool movie here. Even the photography is bad, too many shades of brown and most of the picture out of focus with exception for the actors.
Marisa Tomei is criminally underused. She is shunted into a sidecar role that fades further away as the movie progresses more and more into schmaltzy clich. I know there are... sub-plots about Nick's estranged daughter (clichd) and his attempts to abuse his ""powers"" to better himself at work but these are really just there to boost the ""man and woman falling in love"" story. Let's be honest, how many movies are out there are about a man and woman falling in love? Too many. Do we need any more? No. But because Mel is in it WWW has become a success.

If one tries to get me to go see a film of this nature, one usually must drag me kicking and screaming to the theatre.  My wife did just that for this film and I do not regret it.  Unlike other cliche and boring films that leave a husband or boyfriend checking his watch every five seconds to escape the movie, this one not only kept my attention but I found myself caring about the characters.
The casting, writing, and plot of this film are amazing.  Mel Gibson is the God of acting.  If you see this film and don't laugh as he puts on panty hose and waxes his legs then perhaps you need to check your sense of humor.  The ""Road Warrior"" is actually a caring father and romantic lover in this film.
The basic story is that of a man's man who grew up in Vegas surrounded by gangsters and showgirls who through a freak circumstance is able to telepathicly hear what women are thinking.  Believe me guys it's not always nice.  At first Gibson's character sees this gift as a curse but soon learns just how blessed he is and begins to use his powers for his own selfish goals but don't worry ladies Mr. Gibson does eventually use his power for good.  He wins the heart of the love of his life at rather unexpected cost.
This film deserves more than five stars if for no other reason than anyone can watch it and enjoy it.  I'm walking proof of that but don't think I'm giving up my Italian horror films.

1273545,2,B00003CXQS,"Mel Gibson is charming, and funny, but the film turns away from it's clever premise too early and opts for being a corny predictable mediocre romantic drama rather than an edgy comedy.
The good news is, Mel Gibson is one heck of a likeable charismatic charming guy.  He does a nice little throw-away dance number as sort of an homage to Fred Astaire (to Sinatra's Don't Dance). He also does a funny impression of Sean Connery.
The funniest moments are mostly the one's you've seen in the commercials (they're a bit less polite in the film then they were in the commercial).  There's a few other amusing ones and plenty of charm and likeable performances from Gibson, Helen Hunt, Alan Alda and Marisa (remember her?) Tomei.  Delta Burke, Valerie Perrine and other actors you might recognize show up but are given very little to do.
After setting up the characters like a high class sit-com with bigger stars, the best the writers can come up with is to have Mel Gibson's character nearly electrocute himself in the bathtub with a hair dryer and wake up several hours later with uncanny ability to hear what women are secretly thinking.  The writers (Josh Goldsmith, Cathy Yuspa and Diane Drake get the credit) at first manage to keep the premise  from being a bad 70's Disney Comedy in new clothing.  They manage with Nancy Meyer's direction to construct some not quite predictable and amusing scenes which allow Mel Gibson to show off his comic timing.  Helen Hunt has had a lot of practice reacting to goofy male hijinks in her t.v. series Mad About You and does a good job here reacting and playing off Mel Gibson.  She shines in a few moments where she's got the laugh lines.
The film drops most of its comedy at about the half-way point and becomes a straight romantic film.  A predictable, corny, tired romantic film which offers no surprises, interesting twists or anything funny during it's last half hour.  The only reason it stays afloat is because of the charm and charisma or the lead actors.
But what do I know? It's doing well at the box-office, a lot of people will tell their friends it's a pretty good film with some very funny scenes in the beginning before it turns into a mushy corny film at the end.
Awwwww mushy and corny ain't so bad is it?
Well, no... there's nothing with some romance and even corniness in a film, but not one that starts out in a different direction and then decides that audiences really want a nice romantic film to go to over the holiday season so we'll play everything as safe and predictable as a t.v. sit-com that suddenly gets serious to deliver a message about doing the right thing and telling the truth.
I hope women (and men too) want more from their movies than this one delivers.  I sure do.
Let me suggest a far better romantic comedy which is not as boring and predictable as this high concept comedy is.  It's still in theaters and its called Chocolat.  (Check out my review of it if you want).
Oh and another thing Women May Want and aren't going to get in this film is another shot of Mel Gibson's buns.

1273546,4,B00003CXQS,"Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call ""What Women Want,"" directed by Nancy Meyers, ""just"" a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well.  Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the ""fluff"" piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the ""cute"" stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of ""Friends.""  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on ""A Christmas Carol,"" with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life.  The screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the ""Man's man"" he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat ""overly"" established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, ""All right I get it!"" Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice.  Mel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the ""Man's man"" theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength--  and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film.  And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the ""Tiny Tim"" role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by ""What Women Want,"" you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.",979689600,6,4887,4.628472222222222
1273547,4,B00003CXQS,"Nice to see a good movie for a change. Kudos to the writers. Two thumbs down to the big (lazy) movie reviewers! [WARNING: some plot spoilers. You may wish to wait until you've seen the movie before reading.]
Rather than ""review"" the movie, lets look at the ""archetypal fairy tale"" inside the movie. I only noticed it because I did a few years of Jungian analysis, and thought others who enjoyed What Women Want might also be interested in this other level to the movie. So I will spend a bit of time explaining some ideas from psychoanalysis before looking at the really interesting bits of the movie. Carl Jung was a contemporary and friend of Sigmund Freud who broke away from the master realizing he could never reconcile his symbolic interpretation of dreams and the psychoanalytic process with Freud's way of doing things. Jung spent his life looking at the connections between fairy tales from around the world, symbols from dreams, and alchemy, all as pointers along the road to ""individuation"" where an individual begins to understand themselves and why they act the way they do. I'm no Jungian analyst, and apologize in advance for over-simplifying Jung, but I think the writers used Jung to help make this movie as interesting as it is. We are introduced to the analytic moment when Bette Midler, playing Mel's psychiatrist says, ""Freud's biggest question was 'What do women want? '""
This movie could be titled ""Individuation: What Women Want from Heroes (in any Good Fairy Tale)."" Our hero, played by Mel Gibson, is ""a man's man,"" meaning he is still the little prince his show girl mom and her show girl friends baby sat in his youth in back stage Las Vegas (another place where dreams are staged). Mel plays a real ""Peter Pan"" figure, a boy who refuses to grow up because he loves the fun of his male-dominated, egocentric world.
In any good fairy tale our hero has to lose something before they can win something. This makes the outcome of the tale ""archetypal,"" or more personally valid and recognizable to each of us in our inner self. [Think of how they structured the Star Wars sagas.] So Mel loses his expected company promotion and the control of his future to his new protagonist: (*gasp*) a woman (Helen Hunt).
Mel hates this and needs to win at any cost, but at the same time realizes that he has to take a different tact in order to survive in this new women's world. He does what Jung called ""holding the opposites in consciousness"" in order to try and get inside a woman's head. (What do they want?) So he pretends to be a woman and tries out the womens' products his company is trying to figure out how to advertise. The archetypal gods then play a trick on poor Mel, and make this a permanent state of affairs. He finds (after a near death experience) that he literally does know what women are thinking and what they want! So he is forced to hold both male and female opposite sides in consciousness. And for a long period in the movie, Mel finds this new talent to be a great tool to help understand his alienated daughter, the women around him, and as a secret weapon to use against his new female boss.
In the heterosexual male individuation process, you get to know your female self, called the anima (women get to know their masculine side, the animus). Mel gets to know Helen through her thoughts, and eventually falls in love with her. He wants to assimilate this anima figure and her qualities into his psyche. In any case, Mel has become a better person for all the confusion and ego change he has had to go through, while becoming more acquainted and comfortable with his anima self that he has projected onto Helen.
Now things become really interesting. Throughout the movie, a young file clerk has been seen at the office. She is someone with a quirky, ironic, but also suicidal twist of mind, delivering files as a nameless any-woman figure in the cold faceless corporate world. Mel, with his newfound knowledge and insight into women's lives, finds out that he has also contributed to this poor woman's fate by ignoring her and her useful business skills. Now she disappears, and Mel fears the worst has happened. He gets her address, somewhere in Chinatown, and rushes off to stop her suicide attempt.

1273548,3,B00003CXQS,"I like Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.  This was a cute, funny and innocent movie about a rich ad executive that gets electrocuted.  After that event, he somehow has gained the power to hear every thought a woman thinks.  It has it's low points like all movies, but for the most part it delivers good laughs.  Mel Gibson is better known for his action or thriller movies but this one should also put him in the romantic comedy slot as well.  What was really neat about this movie was all of the cameo appearances that shot up throughout the 2 hour + movie.  Bette Midler, Delta Burke, and Alan Alda.  This wasn't the best movie out there right now.  But if you want a good laugh or just a good movie to take a date to, then Mel Gibson is your man.",978134400,2,742,4.176056338028169
1273549,3,B00003CXQS,"The whole idea of this movie, many people might think is dumb, I know I did, infact, I didn't even want to see this movie. Others may think it's a pretty good idea for comedic film. So, do I now, after seeing this movie. There were a lot of good funny possibilities that could and did take place. Mel Gibson is Nich Marshall, ""the man's man"", he has a special talent most men would like. He can get just about any women into bed with him. He feels he knows women very well. He thinks he knows what they want and think. So, with this sort of thinking going on, he feels he's due for a promotion at an ad agency he works at. But he later finds out from Alan Alda that the job is going to a woman. Women between the ages of 16-25 ( I think that's right) are now the leading consumers. And ONLY  a woman will be able to know what other woman want. Of course Nick (Gibson) is going to immediately  resent whoever he feels has taken his job, and he does, as soon as he meets Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt). But later that same night, after sampling a supply kit of female products (this makes for a very funny scene, especially when he tries waxing his legs. He makes a comment stating something along the lines of...Why would a woman want to do that to herself!) he accidentially electrocute's himself. When he wakes up the next morning he finds that he now has the power to read into what woman are thinking....and he hates it!!! Many,many funny scenes occur after he has gotten this ""gift"" shall we say. He finds out things he, to put clearly, doesn't want to know. And we go from one funny scene to another. Nancy Meyers ( Someone who is new to me) has done a very good job directing this movie. It's very well done. The only problem I have with the movie is, I feel Gibson was miscast. I think he's a bit to old to be playing this character. He has to be in his late 50's, possible 56, 57. I think the character should of been a younger,more brash, man. Some in his late 30's or 40's. Perhaps a Robert Downey Jr. type. But I guess the reason Gibson was put into this movie is because he's ""what women want"" to see! I don't think people should take their childern to go see this movie, it does contain some scenes maybe parents don't want to watch with younger childern, either because the childern won't simple ""get"" it, or the parents will be embarrassed to watch the scenes with their childern. It does make for a good date movie though. A very entertain movie with lots of laughs. One all adults should see!",978134400,,2505,4.2384937238493725

7917568,3,B00003CXQS,"It's a very light-hearted and enjoyable film, but when you break it down, it's basically the Feminist Agenda training a White Knight, which is a real shame.
Men are basically viewed as pigs, unless they act like the slaves of women, and that attitude gets really tiring.

The refreshing thing is that Mel Gibson's character doesn't really let most things phase him, throughout the movie.
He just kinda' rolls with the punches, until the end of the movie, when he tells his chick he needs ""rescuing"".

Everything up until the end made sense, but the movie didn't close very well.
It was sloppy.

This movie has the potential to be a 4-star production, and by all means, it's still a very re-watchable motion picture, but like I said, there are a few things that really knock it down a star.
There could easily be a remake of this, in the future, but the movies they make nowadays don't compare, so who cares.",1513382400,3,907,4.58641975308642
