8313382,5,B001JP64AU,"If you love B-Horror or Sci-Fi movies (ex. Ed Wood movies) or just movies that are so non-nonsensical and/or corny that you can't help but laugh, you NEED this movie in your collection! I don't even like 70s movies, but this was too good to pass up!",1279929600,,249,4.319148936170213
8313383,1,B001JP64AU,"Tiger Love (aka Legend of the Tiger) stars Stephen Tung as a young man raised in the jungle by his mother and a tiger. It is terrible with weak choreography and a ridiculous story. Don't be fooled, Lo Lieh only appears for about 10 minutes of the movie. To make matters worse, it goes from a poor martial arts flick and morphs into an awful ghost story with a marauding tiger determined to take revenge on people that killed his master. Avoid at all costs.",1232064000,,456,4.376470588235295
