2434536,5,B000BP796C,"This is the second Shawn Trautman DVD that I bought and both have been outstanding (the first was the Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing - see my other review).  I wanted to at least learn Two Step and Swing and ended up with much more.  My boyfriend and I went through all 8 dances and enjoyed each one.  Shawn and Joanna made the lessons very easy and at no point did we feel overwhelmed or out of our league.  We're not experts, but we no longer feel like idiots out there.  We're definitely fans and recommend this DVD also.",1148083200,17,527,4.23
2434537,5,B000BP796C,"This is the perfect way to get ready to go out on the dance floor with any partner to do any dance!  When you take the lessons on this video, you will learn so many exciting dances - and fast!  At first, I wondered if I would get confused with the variety on the sampler.  But after taking this lesson, I learned that when you have good instructors, any confusion is quickly converted to confidence. I found that as my skills started to develop, I wanted to go back and view the video again. This is a dance lesson that keeps on giving - anyone at any dance level will discover something new to learn!",1145664000,22,601,4.208695652173913
2434538,5,B000BP796C,"I've always wanted to learn some couples dances but frankly, could not get my husband excited about it enough to go to a studio for regular lessons. He bought me this DVD instead as a gift and I was instantly impressed. I was worried that by not having an actual instructor in a studio with you, it would be hard to follow along, but this DVD explains the steps so well--it breaks them down into segments, and my favorite part is the fly-out screens that show just the instructors' feet: SO helpful. The lessons were also not at all cheesy or cutesy and got right into the steps, no-nonsense. My husband and I both have a great time dancing along to the lessons (and we're still practicing!) and we have learned so much. Great product. Five stars all the way.",1133827200,64,759,4.428571428571429
2434539,5,B000BP796C,"This DVD was a great way for my husband and I to learn to dance.  My husband has 2 left feet and wouldn't go to classes for fear that he would look stupid.  This DVD was a great way for him to learn without the fear of others watching.  We learned and practiced at home.  When we went to his nephews wedding his family was shocked that he could dance!

Thanks Mr. Trautman for breaking down the steps and allowing us the chance to dance together other than just swaying back and forth as we hang on each other.",1132876800,33,510,4.111111111111111
2434540,5,B000BP796C,"This is excellent!  We're beginners and could follow along easily enough without feeling like idiots (that's huge for us). We really liked the fact that we could dance along with the instructors the exact way they were facing without having to turn around or mis-interpret what was going on. My husband felt very comfortable with the instruction and wasn't turned off by the teachers, which has been the case with other videos we've tried. I found it clear to understand and enjoyable to watch and copy.  The instructors do a good job of giving enough information about each dance without being ""cheesy"" and then giving you some things to work on. I highly recommend this video if you want a great overview and some fun things to get out and dance.  Very good!",1132790400,35,760,4.6992481203007515
2434541,5,B000BP796C,"I have had some serious problems when learning to dance. With other dance DVDs, I would practically hurt myself in order to keep up with the fast-paced instructors. This was my first DVD with Shawn and Joanna and found that the basic steps were well-explained and it was enough to give me a good foundation on each dance.  I also bought their ballroom starter kit and thought the selection of the dances that they taught was good and like the fact that I can learn more of each dance through other DVDs they have. If you want a quick way to sample and learn several types of dances without looking like a fool, you should try this one.",1168387200,7,635,4.38135593220339
2434542,4,B000BP796C,"great for use as a sampler, however, if you are looking to really learn any of these dances, you are better off finding something more specific.",1168300800,7,144,4.576923076923077
2434543,5,B000BP796C,"Like all Shawn Trautman's dance instructional DVD's, this is very professionally done and easy to learn the steps. Highly recommended!",1166572800,6,134,5.75
2434544,5,B000BP796C,This was the first DVD that we bought from Shawn Trautman's collection and we thought it was very well done.  We learned some very important things on leading and following and liked the tips that were given for leading and following.  We're just starting out and wanted to see some of the different dances and this one gave us a good mix of what's out there.,1164153600,6,359,4.424242424242424
2434545,4,B000BP796C,My husband and I are very pleased with Shawn and Joanna's Couples Ultimate Dance Sampler.  We learned something on every dance that we had not learned yet.  We also learned the differences between some of the dances.  We were very Pleased.,1161734400,7,239,4.780487804878049
2434546,5,B000BP796C,"I have now had a chance to review both this DVD and Party Line Dances and I thought they were both great! They were the most thorough dance DVDs that I have ever seen, and I have seen plenty. This DVD covers so much information, but it's all relevant to the dances.  A wonderful overview and starting point for each one.",1153094400,14,320,4.245901639344262
2434547,5,B000BP796C,"This DVD is just awesome. Shawn is very clear in his instructions, his steps and his moves. Anyone can follow him and be dancing in no time. Let Shawn put the fever of dancing to eight dances in your life. Most assuredly a five star. You'll be dancing your legs off in no time.",1150934400,12,277,4.148148148148148
2434548,5,B000BP796C,"Just as the title suggests, this sampler video is easy and great for beginners.  Shawn and Joanne made us feel comfortable right from the start. It was enough to get us excited about the fact that we could do the basics and then move us into other forms.  We had no idea what the dances looked like, so this was huge as we felt as though we progressed much further than we expected to.  Also, the leading and following section in the beginning was very helpful and we really liked the format of the lessons.",1149984000,11,507,4.315789473684211
2434549,5,B000BP796C,This DVD is just as good as the other DVD that I bought.  It teaches the basics for several different dances.  A must have for anyone interested in learning to dance!,1148256000,18,166,4.32258064516129
2434550,5,B000BP796C,"Just as I had hoped, this is a true beginner's dvd and nice to include a taste of so many dances. The explanation of leading/following in the beginning was especially helpful.  We're looking forward to continuing on with other DVD's from Shawn.",1148169600,13,244,4.809523809523809
8090356,1,B000BP796C,This was a waste of money and too difficult to follow!,1487721600,,54,4.0
8090357,5,B000BP796C,"We started with this DVD years ago. It is a great sampler to get you going if your not sure what ""your cup of tea"" is. Turned out the 2 step, the cha-cha (to our surprise) and the triple two step our fav's. We are looking forward to trying the new two  step series and the walt next. The teaching is excellant. It is broke down into simple steps.  You stand in front of your TV the same directions that the instructors are (ie girl stands the same direction as girl instructor). You don't need much room in front of the TV do do this. Also can play on your laptop and move it to somewhere with more room. Then when you and you honey are more comfortable, move out to the dance floor. ""Dance like no ones watching""  :)",1405555200,,717,4.107142857142857
8090358,5,B000BP796C,"The Couples Ultimate Dance Sampler by Shawn Trautman was perfect for me as I've always enjoyed dancing but never learned the basics of these dances. As a young woman, I was limited to the dancing that was only done at college dances and balls. This led me to search for a DVD that allowed me to learn not just one type of dance but a variety. I always thought of the dancing world to be quite intimidating but this DVD breaks it down to eight easy dances that anyone who wants to dance could learn from and use.

What I enjoyed most about this DVD was that it was easy to follow even though I was learning without a partner. It was like having a private dance instructor in my living room teaching me the basic steps at a pace I could follow. Shawn's technique of first teaching the basics and then advancing you to feel comfortable going out on your own is what gave me the confidence to break out of my normal club setting and venture out to new dancing opportunities. It's great having that confidence and equally wonderful knowing which dances I want to learn more of. My personal favorites were the Waltz and Salsa! I have confidence in Shawn's teaching style and look forward to the full beginner DVDs to enhance my dancing skills. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking to break out of the normal dancing scene and expand their interests in dance.",1185926400,6,1362,4.448
8090359,5,B000BP796C,"This is a fantastic sampler, but that is what it is. It is a great DVD if you want to get an idea of what dance you would like to get more in depth training. For $10 or so, it is worth it.  If you already have experience, then you should probably purchase a DVD that includes a program that is for a dancer(s) moving to the next level.",1179878400,5,335,3.8550724637681157
8090360,5,B000BP796C,We found the DVD to be very easy to follow. It was comfortable to watch (love the split screen) and listen to.  The Sampler made it easy for us to pick the dances we wanted to pursue. We'll be ordering more in the future. The other thing we were impressed with was the great customer service.,1179446400,6,292,4.214285714285714
8090361,2,B000BP796C,"Very basic--- fundamental production values...Should probably go with a video that does not try to superficially cover quite so many styles, but restricts itself to fewer topics but more in-depth coverage and more practice music time.....",1179014400,2,238,5.638888888888889
8090362,3,B000BP796C,"This movie was OK, but not impressive.  Each dance only taught two or three basic steps, and there was not enough practice time with the music to truly feely confident about those steps.  My fiance and I did learn the dances, but not without much pausing, stopping, rewinding, and frustration.  I am a modern dancer, and pick up movement very quickly, and if it weren't for my ability to break-down and explain the movement, we might not have gotten some of the more difficult moves.",1170374400,5,483,4.658823529411765
8090363,5,B000BP796C,"I highly recommend this DVD for beginner dancers who want to learn couple's dances. Shawn and his his wife break down the steps in a way that is easy to follow, even if you've never danced before. I purchased this DVD to learn for my upcoming wedding. I thought I would have to pay for private lessons to learn; now that I got this DVD I know I won't have to do that. This DVD is great and you won't be disappointed; you also save money from paying for private lessons.",1169596800,10,469,4.164835164835165
8090364,5,B000BP796C,"I bought this dvd along with the Ballroom & Latin and also the Slow and Romantic Samplers. I spent a lot of time researching different dance instruction videos and decided on the Shawn Trautman collection.  I'm so glad I did.  My husband and I pretty much only danced to fast music with the sway thing going on.  Now we can actually get out there and dance to all types of music.  The instruction is very well taped and easy to follow.  They go over the steps enough to learn them well, but not bore you. I always envied the couples that looked like they've been dancing together for years, but now I feel comfortable enough dancing, that we actually look like those people too!",1168473600,13,678,4.435483870967742
8090365,5,B000BP796C,My wife and learned the slow dancing basics in about 30 minutes. Now we can slow dance with some style!,1168473600,7,103,4.2
