8753273,5,B01CJCQE56,"This DVD includes three segments, 60 minutes for each;

1. BUILDINGS
2. HOMES
3. PARKS

Three hours of very informative and educational presentation in regard to 30 particular projects, 10 commercial buildings, 10 residential buildings and 10 parks that transformed architecture in the US. Now the residential and commercial video are informative but those projects really did not have the kind of impact anyone may think they had although there was some impact. But instead, those parks are a complete different story. After watching the park video, you will be prompted to really go and visit those parks as well as demand better parks in your own neighborhood. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1461110400,8,684,5.153153153153153
8753274,5,B01CJCQE56,"As a journalist, I was invited to preview this three-part series before it aired on PBS in early April 2016. I'm adding this review to the DVD of the programs because I'm sure a lot of Americans will enjoy discovering these 30 locations, particularly if you're thinking about travel plans around the U.S. At this point in 2016, we've been inundated with British-made video tours of grand estates inspired by Downton Abbey. As a journalist who cares about encouraging a proud and hopeful view of our nation, I'm urging you to feast your eyes on these 30 intriguing corners of the United States that made our nation what it is today.

Dont confuse this with the 2013 series 10 Buildings That Changed America, although WTTW-Chicago was behind both projects. In fact, if you're intrigued by this trio, you might want to also pick up the original documentary from WTTW. This large-scale documentary series is part of the effort to tell ""our"" national story as Americans without neglecting the frequently ignored millions in communities ranging from Native Americans to the urban poor to waves of immigrants from many lands.

As a veteran journalist, I often tell community leaders that America needs a new generation of men and women like Jacob Riis and Nellie Bly. Her life still is famous enough, including her daring work that exposed abuse of the mentally ill, that Nellie's work was described in a 2016 episode of the Madam Secretary TV series. But Riis? He's not as well known, these days. Reporting in the 1880s from the worst tenements in New York City, Riis was among the first American photographers to use a European style of ""flash photography"" to document the life-threatening conditions in those teeming New York neighborhoods. He took his readers right into dingy apartments, packed with people and often no light or indoor plumbing. Both Bly and Riis sparked major changes in public health.

So, I was thrilled to discover the first of the three parts in this new seriesthe episode called 10 Homes that Changed Americaintroduces Riis and the importance of his work in forcing tenement owners to bring at least a few very basic amenities to these families.

When hearing about this new series, does the subject of tenements surprise you? You'll discover that this series is not a typical made-for-TV tour of the playgrounds of the rich and famous. The series opens with the significance of the 600-year-old Taos Pueblo in New Mexico. Two Native American spokesmen show us around the pueblo and talk about the powerful cultural legacy of living in a safe and healthy community that was designed while Europeans were still emerging from the dark ages.

Yes, this series also includes some opulence to make viewers smile and pencil favorite locations into summer-time travel plans. Across the three programs (April 5, 12 and 19), our 30 stops include Thomas Jefferson's amazing ""essay in architecture"" Monticello, the Hudson River castle Lyndhurst, Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, San Antonio's colorful River Walk, and even Salt Lake City and its soaring temple as an example of how faith shapes urban design.

As we tour these locations, we get intriguing commentary both from residents and experts in the history of design and American culture. Planning ahead for some of your own travels around the U.S.? For now, make 10 That Changed America your destination for some eye-opening TV viewing.",1459641600,8,3406,5.008833922261484
