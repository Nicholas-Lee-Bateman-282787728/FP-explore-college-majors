6120076,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"I'm on a barre kick these days and love it.  Previously, I did heavy weight training and intense cardio.  In an effort to mix things up, I decided to try barre.  Talk about a humbling experience!

Suzanne aptly describes her barre workouts as, ""shake to change.""  Yep, your muscles will shake and they will change for the better!

Why I love this workout:

* The structure of it.  You can do the entire workout or choose which sections you want to do.  The sections include:
--Warm Up (3 min)
--Light Weight Work (for upper body) (9 min)
--Thigh Work (14 min)
--Seat Work (19 min)
--Mat Work (16 min)
--Stretch (13 min).

* The form pointers are spot on.  Yes, Suzanne does seem to talk a lot, but with these barre moves, form is so critical, that's it is important to be extra-aware of your form.  I am especially grateful that Suzanne spends so much time going over the pretzel postures.

* The balance postures.  These postures are challenging, but it is so important for us to work on our balance as we age.

* It's hard!  Most reviews of this workout, put it in the intermediate category, but it sure challenges me.  The upper body section is particularly hard.  Who knew that tiny 3 pound weights could cause such a burn?

* The modifiers.  One exerciser is doing an easier version of the exercises and the other one is doing a more challenging version.  Um, guess which one I was following (and it was still hard for me).

There are no negatives to this workout.  I love that it gives me room to grow.  Maybe someday I will be able to complete all the reps or lift my legs almost as high as Suzanne.  It's something to work towards.

If you are looking for a fun and effective barre routine, this may just be the workout for you!",1395532800,52,1736,4.363636363636363
6120077,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"Suzanne Bowen in my opinion is the absolute best instructor on proper alignment and form I have seen. I have been doing barre type lotte berk style workouts for a while now but wasn't until I started using Suzanne's streaming workouts and dvd's did I really start noticing results fast. I realized I was using improper form on some excersizes (I actually injured my lower back doing the curl wrong) and therefor wasn't maximizing results. She is brilliant on form, cueing, and putting together SMART excersizes that are very effective. Best purchase I've made in a long time...",1394323200,14,577,4.8979591836734695
6120078,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"I am just getting over cold.  I know, why on earth would that even matter!  Well, I was anxious to start working out as soon as I felt able to do so.  However, I like to ease into my normal exercise routine after getting sick.  I decided to start out with Suzanne Bowen's Barreamped DVD.  It was perfect. This was my first time working out to this DVD since buying it a few weeks ago.  I did buy her Barramped Bootcamp DVD and highly recommend that video as well.  She is wonderful teacher for a beginner student.  She is a fabulous teacher for an advanced student and everyone in between.  Her instructions with regard to setup and form are beneficial for all types of barre workouts.  It adds so much more to the overall barre experience.  I have these workouts 'The Booty Barre,' 'Physique57,'  'Squeeze DVD and all its variants,'  'The Bar Method,' and 'The Ballet Body Series.'  I love all the DVD's that I personally own; however, Suzanne Bowen's instruction will help me achieve the finishing touch with my current barre programs.  She is outstanding.  This DVD is well produced.  I intend to keep this in my exercise rotation for the excellent form reminders so that I get more out of my workouts.

Update 2/26/14 -  There seems to be an editing glitch in the section for the thigh area. A video clip or frame pops up somewhere towards the end of the set.  Also on the section for the seat area, she does the figure four stretch on the wrong leg.  I wasn't sure but you will notice Stephanie who is the modifier make a fast adjustment from one leg to another.  I still recommend this DVD.",1393286400,7,1596,4.449826989619377
6120079,5,B00GVH3ZBC,Suzanne Bowen's BarreAmped method is wonderful!  I have taken BarreAmped classes and use her streaming workouts as well.  I was so impressed with this dvd.  She is such a great motivator and her method is effective and fun!  I highly recommend this dvd for anyone looking for a highly effective and gentle workout.  I have noticed such wonderful changes in my body from this method.  I am more toned and wake up feeling great!,1393286400,2,426,4.6891891891891895
6120080,5,B00GVH3ZBC,I LOVE these DVD's!  I take BarreAmped at home & am obsessed with it!  I travel quite a bit for work so it is great to be able to bring these with me.  I have tried other barre methods when I have been out of town & they are not even close to BAby far my favorite method out there!,1392508800,5,281,3.65

6120082,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"This is a very professionally done DVD.  Suzanne is personable and pleasant while at the same time leading a very challenging workout.  I was definitely shaking and that is by design, so I felt like this was time very well spent!",1390435200,4,229,4.560975609756097
6120083,4,B00GVH3ZBC,"I like this barre dvd, suzanne is a great instructor and she will give you clear instructions. I bought this one and the barre bootcamp and I found this one a little less challenging than the bootcamp one, so if you are thinking about buying just one of them I would recommend the boot camp better since is more challenging and it includes cardio to elevate your heart rate up. Very effective exercises.",1389744000,14,403,4.534246575342466
6120084,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"Oh my goodness, I love this DVD! I watched it all the way through once before doing it, and I didn't think it would be as hard as the studio classes are. I am glad to say that I am wrong! The only thing that I really miss is some of the core work in the studio - round back/flat back. But this is about as close as I can get at home without having a barre installed in my living room!

Suzanne is all about a neutral spine (not a tucked position). She is all about good form - form first, then you can progress to the next level. She reminds you to line up your ears over your shoulders, over you hips, over your heels, which is a mouthful, but it helps! She also reminds you to zip your abs without tucking your pelvis multiple times. I usually need the reminder!

DVD Breakdown:

Intro: 2 min - Suzanne introduces the other ladies with her (BarreAmped instructors) and explains who to follow if you need to modify, and who to follow to be more advanced. There are also some slight previews of the segments here. You can watch this on YouTube if you would like to get a sneak peak of the DVD!

Warm-up: 3 min - Start off with a few breaths before doing knee lifts with variations. Next is leg lifts to the back, then chair pose with pulses.

Light Weight Work (upper body) : 9 min - Suzanne recommends weights between 1-3 lbs (I'm using my 1.5 lb walking weights for now). The modifier is demonstrating weightless. First is front shoulder work with lifts, flutters (little bends and stretches), and circles. Next is middle shoulder, lifts, flutters, and circles. Middle back is next. Next you hinge over and work the rear shoulder. The flutters on this one are pretty intense! Last, keeping the hinge, you work the triceps behind you. I usually hate working my triceps, but I like this exercise better than most. You finish with stretches - triceps, side, chest.

Thigh Work: 14 min - Grab a chair for this one. You start with 2nd position (wide pli&eacute;) with little pulses. Next you lift one heel and work each side with pulses down and up before lifting both heels and pulsing. Then you shimmy (go side to side) before lifting hips to ribs. You really shake on this hold! Next is V-position with forward leg lifts, rotations, and flutters. You can really feel this one when you do the rotations - rotate the thigh parallel, then out. The next position is parallel, then you lower to really work the thighs. Holds, pulses, and hips really start to light a fire in the legs! A well-deserved stretch is next, followed by V-position with pulses and lifts. The last exercises starts with narrow V position with a releve, then you tuck and untuck, working your abs and back. From the high V, you circle your hips. Last, you do a ""water ski"" position - leaning back a little and tucking your pelvis. You finish out this segment with another wonderful stretch!

Seat Work: 19 min - This segment starts with rear leg lifts, first with toes on the floor, then lifting, then flexing the heel and pointing the heel. The standing leg really starts to burn on this one. Then you bend the knee, and bend and straighten, and do circles with the knee bent. Next is Saw and Fold Over. This works the hamstrings like crazy! I was burning and shaking so much on this one. You get a nice figure 4 stretch after you work each side on this one, which I really appreciated after all that work. Next, you go down to the floor for pretzel, which Suzanne really explains well. I had to follow the modifier on this one. With your leg bent back behind you, you squeeze the glutes. Then you lean over and hold that leg parallel and behind your hip for more work. There's another nice stretch after you work each side of this one, as well.

Mat Work: 16 min - You start this one holding plank position. Then, with arms wider, you do pushups. Suzanne takes you down to the lowest point of your pushup and has you hold. Next is forearm planks with hip drops, followed by side planks. The next exercise is reverse pushup for the back of the arms. The curl is next. You end with Superman (Suzanne says in another DVD that she never leaves the back untouched after working the abs). You finish with some nice stretches.

Stretch: 13 min - Suzanne is alone on this one. You start with hip stretches, runners lunge, then stretch the back of the opposite leg. Next you go from plank into pigeon. Then you sit cross-legged while stretching the neck. Next you stretch your shoulders and triceps, followed by a chest stretch. You end in cobbler stretch, or butterfly. Advanced option is to sit angular on the mat.

Tutorial: This is a must-watch for anyone new to barre exercises. Suzanne explains proper form for some of the common positions. You can also watch her YouTube channel for more form tips. First, she explains the neutral spine (untucked) and keeping the knees soft. Then she explains parallel position for thigh work. Next is V-position, followed by wide 2nd position. For seat work, she explains the proper way to take your leg back and a proper fold over. On the floor, she demonstrate pretzel and the correct way to do pushups. Last, she demonstrates the curl.",1388966400,156,5142,4.466453674121405

6120088,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"These barre workouts never make me feel like I'm incapable and always encourage me to feel the burn.

Suzanne Bowen is one of my favorite video instructors because she approaches even the most challenging workouts with positivity. Her style is reassuring rather than abrasive, which works really well for me (I always feel offended by Jillian Michaels, haha). For the past few months, this has been my go-to workout and I feel better than ever. I highly recommend this for anyone who is taking their first jump into at-home barre and needs a friendly face to start with.",1487548800,4,570,4.816326530612245

6120096,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"Suzanne is a great instructor. The workouts are just as good, if not better, than going to a fancy studio.

6120098,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"I am really enjoying the Barre Stretch and the Relaxation Stretch. Suzanne Bowen really works you through active stretches, so the majority of practices on the DVD are truly strengthening stretches. Her Lower Body was super challenging with the splits, which isn't going to happen for me any time soon, but that should give you a good picture of the challenges Bowen puts in. The first Barre Stretch is a great workout that will get you breathless, shaking, and satisfied with good lower body toning. I also feel looser in the hips afterward, which I need. Her Relaxation Stretch is very good at stretching various parts--it's not a ""flow"" relaxation but a down-to-business series of stretches that ends with a Savatsana that is very nice to do.

This is not for beginners, but rather a challenge for Intermediates on up.",1472774400,7,821,4.864285714285714
6120099,5,B00GVH3ZBC,Wonderful workout!! Definitly try this one. Disc 1 presents two workouts for strength and stretch and Disc 2 will help you stretching after workouts and relaxing for example after long hours sitting at the office. You may combine Disc 1 workouts for a longer stretching class. Suzanne is a great instructor.,1472342400,4,307,5.03921568627451

Can choose from stretches that really challenge and get the heart rate up and the sweat going but all in a gentle, non-punishing style or from stretches that are easier and relaxing.  So appreciate having a focused stretch DVD (2 disc at that!) w/ options for challenging yet doable routines to build strength and flexibility.  Feel like so many instructors these days lose sight of the importance of stretching and Suzanne never does.  She includes warmups and stretches in all of her non-stretching DVD's as well (and not just 2-3 minute stretches but real stretches to help make sure your muscles get the full benefit of all the hard work you're doing!).  Brilliant and such a neglected area of fitness for a lot of people.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.",1471219200,14,837,4.731034482758621
6120105,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"This DVD came in the nick of time since I am rehabbing my back.  I am used to hard core workouts and needed a way to still keep as much strength as possible as well as that stretched out feeling in my muscles as I heal. Done. This DVD would also work for those want to begin any exercise regime and learn great form in which to build when you do any other type of workouts or exercise too, or even just walking as I have started doing more of, but, taller with a mindset of how my body is really working, and most importantly, feeling. I still get that BarreAmped "" feel good workout' that I can look forward to and still get a consistently stronger body without having to do crazy cardio. If you want a  great workout, and also are healing from an injury, OR just want to strengthen with a MINDFUL workout, this is a good series.  Suzanne always gives options, yet entices you to ""get in there"" and challenge yourself.",1471219200,2,919,4.24

Stretching is so important in fitness and she is a woman who knows what she is doing. The first disk is more power stretch. You will work up a nice ""glisten"" and feel your muscles burning while stretching others. The second disk is taken down a notch and hits every part of the body in a more relaxing environment. The music is so amazing in both and leaves me feeling so peaceful.",1471132800,6,506,4.22680412371134

I actually went online, ordered 3 more of her videos and 1 year of access to her website where she posts new videos on a weekly basis (can't recommend the streaming enough!).

The shake (and burn) is no joke. You will feel it afterwards as well. My daily workouts consist of a pair of routines: light weights w/thighs, light weights w/seat, light weights w/floor, etc. I also perform either the warm up or stretch with each pair. I rest 1 day a week. Now, my arms have been an extreme problem for years. I have done sooo many workouts with only minimal results. This one: next day I could see the difference.

6120128,5,B00GVH3ZBC,My best friend has been an avid  proponent of the Lotte Berk Method for years and recently told me she had found a new workout to spice up her routine.  I myself have been looking for a work out that was not as high impact as P90X so I decided to try Barre Amped at her insistence.  Now I am by no means a ballerina but I was interested in giving it a shot and I must say that I was really impressed!  The work outs were intense and I feel that they will make a difference in flexibility as well as helping with my weight loss.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a new workout!!,1457913600,3,602,4.025210084033613

6120140,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"This is a great barre video that is not too tough but works you out nonetheless.  Suzanne is an excellent instructor and I'm pretty finicky when it comes to fitness trainers I like and who provide results.  She's pleasant but not too perky and explains how to perform each exercise correctly; she also includes modifiers for those that are just beginning these types of routines.  The DVD starts with and introduction and brief warm up then shifts the focus into each muscle group.

The first segment is light weight work (9 minutes).  I admit that one of the reasons I bought this DVD was because I tend to get bulky and thought that trying light weights would made my arms look smaller.  Who knew 3 pounds could feel so heavy?  Suzanne focuses mainly on your various shoulder muscles, the middle back and the triceps.  She doesn't do a lot of reps but the flutters and ""holds"" she does with most of the exercises had me quivering a bit.  I combine this with the upper body work outs in Suzanne's ""Tighten, Tone and Torch"" and Leah Sarago's ""Ballet Body: Total Body"" and my arms are much sleeker.  My boyfriend was amazed by the results and said my arms/shoulders have never looked better so I'll be sticking with my little 3 pounders from now on!

The second section is thigh work (14 minutes).  These are basic barre moves: plies, plies with pulses, leg lifts, ""v"" position exercises, etc.  At first I thought they were too easy but when I realized my form was off my legs were screaming and wobbling around like jello.  Suzanne's motto is ""shake to change"" and that's exactly what my thighs were doing!

Seat work is the third segment (19 minutes).  Suzanne does leg lifts, subtle muscle movements, etc., along with the ""pretzel.""  I had never done the pretzel before but she explains it well and I'm sure I'll be feeling the after effects tomorrow!

Last but not least is mat work (16 minutes).  This was my least favorite part of the DVD.  She starts with some plank and side planks, which are effective for both the arms and the midsection, but she doesn't do much else for the core.  I think the exercises she does are referred to as being ""C curves"" but they were hard on my lower back and did little for the abs (I probably was doing everything incorrectly, however).  At least she included the ""superman"" to stretch out the back but I don't think this did a thing to strengthen my abs.  I'd recommend the core section of Leah Sarago's ""Ballet Body: Total Body"" for a decent workout in that area.  She works your abs from every angle.

Suzanne also includes a great series of stretches at the end (13 minutes) that work out the kinks and feel wonderful.

All in all I'm very pleased with this DVD and will be using it quite often, if only for the arm thigh segments alone.  Suzanne joins the ranks of my favorite trainers with this one and her ""Tighten, Tone and Torch"" video, which is a compliment since I have a ton of work out DVDs and the ones I use the most are those done by Suzanne, Jessica Smith and Leah Sarago.  Highly recommend!",1433203200,15,3049,4.494545454545454

We are returning the DVD's because we feel they take way to long to complete, they aren't enjoyable, and they aren't very effective. Jessica Smith TV has great workouts online.

This DVD honestly helped me tone my 36 year old body (two kids) for the first time in my life. I was shocked this could be possible. I do Suzanne's method probably 3-4 hours per week, which includes stretching (very important) - and that's it! I don't feel like I need to spend more time than this to achieve great results and feel strong. Suzanne offers wonderful cues, attention to form and mind-body connection - unbelievable results and de-stressing feeling at the completion of the workout and many hours after. I own four of her DVDs and once I discovered her 3-4 years ago - I don't see myself switching to another instructor. Best discovery ever! If you are considering purchasing this DVD, you will feel so glad you came across it :) Best of luck and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :) BTW, I bought three extra of these to give to my girlfriends.

6120163,5,B00GVH3ZBC,"I'm a pretty critical person, in general, but especially when it comes to workout dvd's, most of which are beyond my tolerance and lean toward a richard simmons type placating. This looked interesting and both dvds had good ratings so went for it. I needed something I could do at home in between prepping snacks and playing puzzles all day. I like this type of workout, I sweat but not a ton, but I  feel like i get a really great and deep workout. My kids like to watch and try to emulate the moves too. I was worried that my easily injured knees wouldn't be able to handle the moves but I was not only able to do the moves, now the muscles around my knees are stronger than ever and I feel zero stress on my knees during workouts and much less pain overall in my knees during other activities. All you need is a yoga mat, small weights, and tall back chair to do this workout and it has a comprehensive program from warm up to stretch that simulates an actual class. I don't workout everyday, or even every week if I'm busy but I try to do this video once or twice a week and have completed the dvd just under 25 times and Ive been already  seeing changes. My legs are leaner, tighter and much stronger, my arms are getting stronger and I'm able to hold plank through the mat section when i wasn't before. And my favorite part, the 'seat' work aka the butt. Ive always had a very small and rather flat butt. I didn't like but figured it what it is. Well after several workouts, maybe 15? i was trying on some clothes and noticed my  derriere looked much happier. It inspired me to workout even more and my husband commented that my butt looked lifted and rounder. Rejoice!!! Im getting a butt! And a sweet one at that! I would definitely keep doing this just for the butt benefits but am really liking my overall physique more and feel in much stronger and capable. I also LOVE that suzanne bowen does streaming workouts and hope to graduate to those soon as I'd like to change it up a little more and keep challenging my body.",1410393600,66,2030,4.28125

Maybe if I had a bar, it would be more appealing, but just holding onto the back of my couch didn't offer as good a range of motion.
