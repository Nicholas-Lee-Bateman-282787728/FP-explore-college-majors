1192061,4,B000006934,"If you are looking for a light hearted, uplifting, and entertaining classic, then this is the one to see.  Jimmy Durante is always at his best, especially as a circus owner, and his affection for an elephant named,  Jumbo.  Doris Day is also wonderful, as always.  This movie has it all,  romance, a little action, comedy, and a lot of good fun.  An endearing  movie that won my heart over, despite it's predictable corny scenes. I  definitely recommend at least renting it.",923961600,8,474,4.695121951219512

Never saw it in theaters, but heard about it from brother when I was stationed in France for three years, told me how glamorous it was when it premiered at the Metropolitan theater (now the Wang) in Boston.  All kinds of celebrities in formal wear gathered at the foot of a huge stair case overlooking the grand lobby.  I really enjoy the Rogers and Hart songs so well done by all involved.  Notice how cleverly the scenes with Day and Durante using stunt doubles are so beautifully integrated.  Have had copies before in CED, laser disk and VHS, this one is really nice, terrific video and surround track !!!",1461024000,4,636,4.592920353982301

1192155,5,B000006934,I love this movie. Is the best of Doris Day? Nope but it is a good movie and very entertaining. It is very rarely ever shown on tv so get it while you can. It is quite a different roll for Durante and most people will only know Martha Raye as 'Witchy Poo' but she is fabulous in this and you really see her talent shine.,1431907200,,320,3.8636363636363638
1192156,4,B000006934,"Okay it was not a success at the box office, but this was when big Hollywood musicals were on the way out.  But it was the last big musical that Doris Day did and the last big musical MGM did.  Full of music, color and circus acts it was based on Billy Rose's Jumbo which was the last big show at the famous New York Hippodrome before it was torn down.  You might ask why it is called ""Billy Rose's Jumbo"", it was because that was Billy Rose's contractual stipulation whether he was involved in the film or not.  He wasn't.  Doris headlines with good songs and gorgeous outfits as Kitty Wonder, the daughter of Pop Wonder (Jimmy Durante) who owns the circus.  She has a hard time with his gambling and they are continually in debt.  When a handsome stranger Stephen Boyd shows up to apparently help out, they are unaware he is helping his father, a rival circus, undermine them and take over their circus.  I know Stephen Boyd may have been a bad cast, he doesn't sing, but he did a good job of lip syncing for James Joyce and many people never knew.  While it was not a great musical, it was a solid musical that show placed Doris Day well.  If you are in the mood for a musical you may have missed or haven't seen in a while, this is one to pass the time with.  Besides -- That Jumbo -- he can really dance.",1431734400,,1309,4.175298804780876

1192180,2,B000006934,"I love old musicals and I love Doris Day, Stephen Boyd, Jimmy Durante, and the great songs of Rogers and Hart. But the film is hugely disappointing. Doris Day was too old  for the role, in spite of relentless soft focus, and Stephen Boyd seems to be in the wrong film entirely. He was a wonderful, intense actor, but musical comedy wasn't his thing at all. And he just doesn't work with Doris Day. It should have been made in the late '40's, but by the time this came out, it was well and truely too late. And for some reason Rodger's and Hart's songs don't sit well with Doris Day's breathy delivery.",1419638400,,601,4.31858407079646
1192181,1,B000006934,"JUMBO begins with a screen bearing the word OVERTURE in gigantic letters, accompanied with orchestral music that is seemingly endless.  No audience today would sit through that before heading to the box office for a refund.  Many circus acts in the film seem to go on and on and on.  I'm a guy who actually likes old musicals, but this one is only slightly more entertaining than watching wet paint dry.  It was good to see Doris Day again, but the only real joy in the film for me was experiencing Jimmy Durante again.  If you are a real fan of Doris Day or Jimmy Durante, buy the movie.  Otherwise, save your money and watch JUMBO sometimes on Turner Classic Movies.",1419638400,,668,4.479338842975206
1192182,5,B000006934,The Blu Ray is beautiful and Doris looks and sounds glorious.  Nice story and wonderful songs from this Rodgers and Hart score. I am so glad its been issued in clear beautiful blu ray.  It was one of the last big MGM movies to come from the big studio.  At the time of this production the big musical era was winding down and the taste of the movie going public was changing.  This may have been the last big musical Doris performed in before all those comedies of the early and middle 60's.  This was really her niche and she always lived up to the expectation. Loved her voice.,1418774400,4,579,4.275229357798165
1192183,5,B000006934,"This is such a delightful movie/musical film to watch. It's a shame it didn't do well in theatres when it was released. My favorite animal is an elephant so it's hard for me not to enjoy this. The movie is about two hours in length and it's the story of the Wonder Circus. In this delightful story, Pop Wonder and his daughter Kathryn/Kitty Wonder (played by Doris Day) are having trouble managing their bills with their circus. One man comes out of nowhere applying for a job with their circus named Sam, played by Stephen Boyd, who Kitty falls for only to find out he's the son of a circus mogul. Kitty and her father ending up losing Jumbo but do get him back in the end. This movie is age-appropriate for everyone.

Doris sings beautiful songs in this movie such as ""My Romance"" and ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"".

1192203,5,B000006934,"Okay...it's not the greatest movie ever made, but as I look back on the many movies I saw during my four years in college, ""Jumbo"" is right up there at the top.  I love Doris Day!  I think I have since ""Everybody Loves A Lover"" was a big hit for her back in the 50's and perhaps my introduction to her as the incomparable songstress she is.  But back to ""Jumbo.""  Stephen Boyd did not do his own singing, but who could tell?  And Doris, gorgeously costumed, Martha Raye, Jimmy Durante...the later two perhaps the most delightful they'd ever been on film...what fun they are to watch!  The music is fabulous!  I'm sitting here now listening to the film's lengthy musical finale...if it doesn't get you up, wanting to run to the circus, perhaps even joining one, I don't know what else will.  I suppose the story is a little silly, predictable, but who cares...when every short while a wonderful piece of music is ours to enjoy on the screen.  I reacquired the soundtrack a few years ago; I have so much music from Doris, my favorites being the music she recorded from '60, '61 and on.  A book released a couple of years ago was built around the author's feeling that Doris Day was perhaps the greatest girl singer of all time.  Maybe...maybe not...but she's certainly left us a legacy of music that few singers could claim.  No matter the music she sang, no matter the film she appeared in, she was just a wonder to listen to and watch.  They don't make musicals like ""Jumbo"" any more; some may say, ""Thank God.""  I grew up on these musicals though...they play a big part in my original introduction to music in films, and ""Jumbo"" continued this tradition.  Watch this movie...it's nostalgic, yes, and so very well done.  Just beautiful to watch.  And note my darling Doris...she's just radiant on screen, as she remained through the sixties and into the 70's.  She IS America's film sweetheart; she is perhaps one of the very best singers of all time.  I love her; perhaps you will too.",1404777600,,1986,4.543661971830986

It is an old movie, not a surprising story line. But It was enjoyable seeing Jimmy Durante, Martha Raye, Stephen Boyd, Dean Jagger, and of course Doris day. It was a light film, about a circus barely making ends meet, with a villain trying to steal it away. The original story was written, I believe 1935, It's a Billy Rose film. Great old songs-This Can't Be Love-My Romance- The Most Beautiful Girl In The World. There is a reason it isn't counted among the great classics.

1192215,4,B000006934,"I'm reviewing just the Billy Rose's Jumbo and not the multi-DVD set many are talking about here, they must have arrived to the review arena through another channel.  For some reason, though I consider myself a great Doris Day fan, I must have subconsciously avoided seeing ""Billy Rose's Jumbo"" until late last week, when I watched it over several days so as not to overdose with pleasure if I stayed with it too long.  Mostly I'd get to a big musical number and then I'd pause and everyone in the room watching it with me would have to stand, at my invitation, and applaud the playersand the director, Charles Walters, beyond a doubt one of the greatest musical directors of all time.  Was he buried at MGM?  I think so.  He certainly stood in the shadow of the big players like Minnelli and Donen, tsk tslk, but here he outdoes himself.

So why was it so unappealing for so long?  Well, I'm old enough to remember my grandparents coming back from an evening showing of Billy Rose's Jumbo at the Smithtown Senior Center, late in the 1980s, and their lips were locked, as if stricken by terror or contempt, and Mom said that as far as she knew, they never spoke of their evening out, ever again, but she too remembered they looked terrified, as though they'd seen something awful.  That, and the idea of Martha Raye, and Jimmy Durante, and Jumbo himself, and the old time period setting and Doris Day dressed as a clown, well, they all seemed awful ideas, visually and otherwise, and maybe I didn't like the idea of the title itself!  Why call it ""Billy Rose's Jumbo?""  Even in 1961 was Billy Rose still a thing?  He couldn't have been bringing in too many customers if so.  Was it in his contract, that if ever they made a film of Jumbo it had to have his name in it somewhere, like National Lampoon's Van Wilder or Lee Daniels' The Butler?

Whatever!  I began watching with enormous resistance but as soon as ten minutes in, I realized I was seeing perhaps the last film of Doris Day's great, and bizarre, drama period.  Paralleling her real life to an eerie degree, the films of this period have her suffering because of a man, and no one, ever, in real life or in the movies, suffers like Doris Day.  remember Julie with Louis Jourdan?  Midnight Lace with Rex Harrison?  Love Me or Leave Me with Cagney?  Well, you get the picture, but here she is, in shock as it turns out over and over her beloved rogue of a father (Jimmy Durante) has a secret shadow side; he's addicted to gambling and puts their livelihood, and that of dozens of other humans and animals, at risk while he goes and gambles away the nights' takings, and in the morning, it's Doris who has to deal with the disaster.  ""Oh Pop, not again, you didn't!"" she wails, having to face the contempt and the misery on the faces of every one in the circus they have let down.  In a way I read this as Doris Day's take on the old legend of Drt Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, where Hyde goes out, gets drunk, gets high, carouses with whores and kills people, and in the morning it's Jekyll who must pay the price.  (Or the other way around, now I can't remember.)  Anyhow this aspect of the movie is as compelling as anything Cassavetes ever had Gena Rowlands do, and yet they get all the credit while it was Doris and Chuck Walters who did the spadework a good ten years or more, and on a tightrope literally, and trapezes, and in clown makeup!  As if that isn't bad enough,

(Spoilers ahead),

Doris is forced to suffer the loss of her beloved pet Jumbo, and these scenes alone should have won her the Oscar she has been denied for over sixty years.  She is magnificent, touching, strong, desperate, loving and fearful all at once as she attempts to console the lachrymose 22,000 pound beast, who doesn't want to go onto the truck and leave the only humans who have ever been kind to him.  And if that isn't enough,

(More spoilers)

Stephen Boyd, as Doris' love interest, has a terrible secret all his own.  This part of the picture reminds me very much of a Minnelli picture of the same vintage called Home from the Hill.  He is the son of a tyrannical circus potentate determined to use Durante's gambling addiction to wrest control of the circus and Jumbo and amalgamate them into their own supercircus, the way that the Ringling Brothers took over Barnum & Bailey's and boasted about it!  It is sheer colonialism and to its credit, the movie, ""Billy Rose's Jumbo,"" emerges with a sane and thoughtout Marxist approach to the brawling America unregulated and unleashed capitalism raging at the period (the movie must take place before the first world war, I would think?) and also at the time of its making, the zenith of Cold War fears of the other, exploited by the masters of war to create a giant spectacle under which they could consolidate their holdings in, well, everything.  At the end of the movie we understand that an arte povera is needed to restore art to its correct place in society.  The film accomplishes all this so beautifully that one takes it as a bittersweet goodbye to a corrupt and venal studio system, but it is as if Walters and company are out on a limb, sawing it off of the dead tree and yet they know they have nowhere themselves to land except into thin air.  It is an effective and long goodbye.

I liked Stephen Boyd in thishe should have played in more dramas like this one, tough and gritty as a mouthful of Kansas dirt.  Martha Raye, whose shtick was that of the plain, lascivious woman, looks beautiful here once in a while, a flicker of magic, while Doris gets to sing Little Girl Blue by Rodgers and Hart and then to stop singing it and instead she acts it out with the fullbodied passion of the great Balanchine dancers like Maria Tallchief or Gelsey Kirkland.  Impressive, and yet did it win her any awards?  My grandfather was especially harsh about this movie.  Even though they saw it for free, he said it was the worst night of his life, he would have paid money not to have to see Raye and Day in their final clown sequence.",1387497600,,6026,4.446769790718835

1192220,5,B000006934,"So far, none of the reviews for ""Billy Rose's Jumbo"" on Amazon are for the Blu-Ray disc issued in October 2013, so I jump into the pool courtesy of my good friend Bruce Deal, who just purchased the disc from Warner Archive to keep his Doris Day collection complete.  I have come relatively late to Blu-Ray.  I even work at a television station where I have been told ""Blu-Ray is already dead"" -- but this is a comment from someone who is part of the video future on mobile phones and tablets.  I protested: ""What about collectors, who value art direction and lighting and costume design and anamorphic ratios?""  My commenter backed down; ""Oh, those,"" he replied, meaning the odd and I guess pitiable collector.

Well, if you are one of ""those,"" and have lagged behind in getting a Blu-Ray player (mine was only $69) for your flat-screen TV (mine is 36"", just right, but I'd be happy with a 60"" if I could fit it in my apartment), you are really missing something.  When done right, Blu-Ray high-definition prints bring out the ""wow"" factor in movies you think you already know and love.

""Jumbo"" is a case in point, and it's not a movie I loved back in 1963 (it opened at Radio City Music Hall in December 1962; I grew up in St. Louis where I must have been exposed to it a month or two later).  I remember when the big-screen musical was dying, and I was a young critic shaking my head at how bad movie musicals like ""Gypsy"" (which I saw live with Ethel Merman in St. Louis in 1961; Roz Russell? No comparison!), ""Hello, Dolly!,"" ""Jumbo,"" ""On A Clear Day You Can See Forever,"" and ""Star!"" were. (""Funny Girl"" is excluded!).  Now I'm a lot older, and while ""Jumbo"" is far from being an ideal or perfect musical, on Blu-Ray it is a revelation, particularly for how accomplished the great studio hands made it technically. (And I plan to watch the above-mentioned movies on Blu-Ray, though my views against ""Dolly"" have already softened.)

I feel I must cite the categories in which ""Jumbo"" excels and the professionals whose dazzling work make it a wonder to behold:  Charles Walters, the director.  William H. Daniels, cinematographer.  Preston Ames and George W. Davis, art directors.  Morton Haack, costume designer.  Charles K. Hagedorn, color consultant.  George Stoll, conductor, and orchestrators who include Conrad Salinger.  Roger Edens, associate producer (and alleged tinkerer with certain lyrics and melodies, though the score is mostly the work of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart).  Even the great Busby Berkeley had a hand in the staging of its musical numbers.

Stephen Boyd is a bit of a stick (with a singing voice dubbed by James Joyce) but he does have some sexual tension with Doris Day (and they allegedly continued to enjoy each other's company after the filming).  Doris Day is a tad old for the part, but, as always, her acting, comic timing and beautiful voice are a pleasure.  Jimmy Durante and Martha Raye play the comic older couple, and except for some dreadful circus sequences and ""clowning,"" they are a delight.

Some of the musical numbers are thrilling (""Over and Over Again"") and delightfully wistful (""Why Can't I?"").  They work most of the time.  ""Little Girl Blue,"" with Doris Day alone in the ring, is fascinating in terms of lighting and mood.  The finale, ""Sawdust and Spangles and Dreams"" (apparently with a bit by Rodgers and and the rest by Edens), is too long and could have been cut to greater effect.

For me, circuses are not a place for unrestrained joy - there's something about the caged animals, making noble beasts like elephants dance and stand on stools, cracking the whip at lions - that makes me worry for the animals.  And clowns - why is this? - are rarely funny.  That said, the elephant who plays Jumbo is a heart-tugger and very talented.  The contributors to the film have made the circus background one of infinite variety and color and patterns.  One almost wishes the cast had somebody like Robert Preston and a better-fitted score by Meredith Willson or Jerry Herman to really make the material come alive.

Despite the qualms, the mastery of the film medium's elements on display (except for the script by Sidney Sheldon) is truly remarkable, and the Blu-Ray rendering makes even Metrocolor ""pop.""  It vividly show s us that film is a collective medium, and when pros come together, their collaboration can be breath-taking.  Thanks, Warner Archive, for making this film available in Blu-Ray, and at such a reasonable price.  And thanks, far too many years late, to the great artists who lent their talents to films from ""the studio system"" that will live on to inspire film fans for ages to come.",1381622400,14,4664,4.731435643564357

The human leads are Jimmy Durante (Anthony Wonder, the clown) and Martha Raye (fortune teller Lulu), playing a duo running a circus troupe, their daughter Kitty (played by Doris Day) and her love interest Sam Rawlins (Stephen Boyd). This story was originally put on the stage in 1935 by Billy Rose in New York's Hippodrome theatre. The movie had a more modest setting - rarely out of the circus, but still with the usual quite spectacular acts. The score was, to me, the most enchanting feature of the movie as the tunes were provided by Rodgers and Hart. Rawlins is the son of a rival circus owner, John Noble (Dean Jagger), and he joins Wonder's nearly bankrupt circus with the intent of sabotaging it to finish it off. But of course he falls for the lovely Kitty. The screenplay was by Sidney Sheldon who became a household name with his series of thriller stories.

Admiteldly, in the fifties, block buster movies used the Circus as a theme with disasters, torrid love affairs, betrayals, jalousies

This is the story of a small, family-run circus back in the early days of the 20th century. Jumbo is an elephant, the star attraction, and he's owned by the father (Jimmy Durante) and daughter (Doris Day) who run the show. They owe their creditors, and they're about to lose the business to a rival circus owner, who sends his son (Boyd) to spy on them, and...never mind. The silly romantic plot takes a backseat to the Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart score, including such songs as ""My Romance,"" ""Little Girl Blue,"" and Mr. Boyd's big number, ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World."" Doris Day has never been lovelier, and Jimmy Durante and Martha Raye are delightful.

I wasn't disappointed with the music in the film, and it was enjoyable enough as an opportunity to see past stars do their stuff.",1194307200,,485,4.651162790697675
1192295,5,B000006934,"It's unfortunate that this delightful circus musical comedy tends to live in the shadow of Cecil DeMille's non-musical  ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", made nearly a decade earlier. I definitely find the present film more enjoyable, with its intertwining of music, comedy, drama and romance. It certainly didn't lack for star power.  Doris Day may have been approaching 40, but she could have passed for 25 and  was perfect for the lead role. Of course, Jimmy Durante and Martha Raye were veteran entertainers of the vaudeville style. Perhaps, as some reviewers suggest, their comedic talents were underutilized. Jumbo is self explanatory. The casting of Stephen Boyd as the lead male is more questionable. He was a good looking hunk, but was no singer and had no special charisma to match that of Doris. Perhaps we would have to look to Elvis or Robert Goulet for an ideal male singer on par with Doris at this time. On the other hand, Boyd did come across as a believable premier circus performer. His acting and singing were sometimes understated, but I didn't find this annoying in most scenes. He(or his dubber?) did a fine job with the introductory tune in the first scene, a perfect number for Robert Goulet. The preceding overture should have been deleted, as it was not memorable and was overlong.
  In the romance department, we have an implied double wedding in the  finale, one the culmination of a stale 14 year engagement between Durante and Martha, the other a whirlwind affair between Doris and Boyd. Prior to this, Boyd found himself in the increasingly uncomfortable position of being a spy for his father who plans to take over this circus, yet is falling in love with Doris, the owner's daughter. Meanwhile, Doris has the unpleasant job of trying to hold off the creditors, due to the irresponsible gambling of Durante. Boyd helps her satisfy the creditors for a while by giving her loaded dice to win big in a crap shoot.
  Doris's first number is the fun ""Over and Over Again"". After she begins to strike up a romance with Boyd, she sings the upbeat ""This Can't be Love"" and ""My Romance"". Then, after the announcement that their circus had been taken over by Boyd's father, she sings the somber haunting ""Little Girl Blue"". Both Boyd and later Durante sing ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"" to their respective sweethearts. Of the several choreographed circus routines, the swarm of flying butterflies was perhaps the most spectacular. Unfortunately, it was cut short by the failure of the tent roof during a violent storm.
  After Boyd joins the other stars with their traveling medicine show, things turn fanciful, as we see them again inside a big circus tent, eventually dawning clown outfits. The guy's boxing match is dull, but the girl's routine is more comical. The fanciful finale follows.",1194134400,2,2823,4.8625

1192298,5,B000006934,"THE DORIS DAY COLLECTION: VOLUME ONE is huge and includes some of the lady's greatest, and  most underrated, movies.  Let us examine them in chronological order.

LULLABY OF BROADWAY (1950) is a dreamy Technicolor musical that takes place all over a studio-set Manhattan, including a Greenwich Village nightclub and a Washington Square townhouse.  Doris Day has an off-again, on-again romance with Gene Nelson, but sings the Oscar-winning title song with him at the end.  Doris and alcoholic singer Gladys George (superb performance) have a mother-daughter relationship.  George does a memorable ""An Old Shanty in Old Shanty Town.""  Nelson has a solo of ""Zing Went the Strings of My Heart.""  There are literally ten songs in 92 minutes of running time.  Doris has a solo of ""You're Getting to be a Habit With Me.""  Providing fun support are S. Z. Sakall as a beer tycoon and Florence Bates as his wife.  S. Z. keeps running into debt bankrolling actresses and shows.  The ending is a happy show-stopper with the exhilarating title song.  David Butler directed.  Minimal bonuses include a Doris Day trailer camp for six of her early movies.

Though it is in a Doris Day DVD boxed set, Michael Curtiz' YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN (1950) is really one of Kirk Douglas' best early films.  It is narrated by Hoagy Carmichael at a piano and goes back to Douglas' Rick Martin as a child addicted to jazz music and a school runaway.  He grows up to be a man obsessed with playing the trumpet (dubbed by Harry James) better than anyone else in the world.  Worldly intellectual Amy (Lauren Bacall) cannot stand that, but likeable singer Jo Jordan (Doris) can and becomes his friend for singer/trumpet duets.  Juano Hernandez is unforgettable as a likeable black musician Kirk idolizes.  Gorgeously photographed in high gloss B&W by Ted McCord (TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, THE SOUND OF MUSIC) and directed with his usual authority by Curtiz, the movie includes smoky jazz renditions of ""Too Marvelous For Words,"" ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""With a Song in My Heart"" and a dozen more.  This is a jazz lover's paradise, and I think Doris' fans will love it as much as Kirk's fan club.  The only bonus is a theatrical trailer.

I believe CALAMITY JANE (1953) is one of Doris Day's personal favorites among her movies.  She gets to do an old-fashioned western, wear cowboy duds and no makeup, and sing exuberant songs like ""I Just Blew In From the Windy City"" and the Oscar-winning ""Secret Love.""  We are in the Old West and the so-called Windy City is Chicago.  Howard Keel is Wild Bill Hickok, Allyn McLerie plays a saloon singer named Katie Brown, and Philip Carey makes it a foursome for romance.  This is a colorful and tuneful western/romantic musical with songs by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster.  For a comparison, rent Cecil B. DeMille's THE PLAINSMAN (1936), with Gary Cooper as Wild Bill and Jean Arthur as Calamity.  It is even better than CALAMITY JANE.

LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME (1955) is a curious film in the Doris Day filmography.  She is downright brilliant as Jazz Age torch singer Ruth Etting, dynamically singing song after wonderful song in reprocessed stereo.  But the movie itself, nominated for six Oscars and a winner for Original Story, is so unpleasant because Oscar nominee James Cagney is so vicious and loathsome as her boyfriend/manager/later husband Marty Snyder.  I love Cagney, but not here.  There is so little to like about Marty that I kept threatening to turn off my DVD.  But then Doris came back on stage to sing a good dozen era songs, including ""It All Depends on You,"" ""You Made Me Love You,"" ""Shaking the Blues Away,"" ""My Blue Heaven,"" 10 Cents a Dance,"" the Oscar-nominated ""I'll Never Stop Loving You,"" and the title song as the film's finale.  Something doesn't ring true about early feminist Ruthie letting a violent gangster control every step of her life and even being willing to marry him.  The restored color is beautiful, the CinemaScope compositions are outstanding, and the Oscar-nominated soundtrack is enthralling.  But Cagney's unredeemed viciousness derailed the movie for me.  Excellent bonuses include 1955 at the (MGM) Movies and two Vitaphone shorts featuring the real Ruth Etting.

THE PAJAMA GAME (1957) is a neglected musical masterpiece about labor conditions in the Sleep Tite pajama factory.  Labor wants a 7   cent raise, and management refuses to budge.  Representing labor is Doris Day at her best as Babe Williams; for management there is John Raitt as Sid Sirokin.  They fall in love, of course.  The costume design is some of the most colorful of the entire 1950's and should have won the Oscar; a young Bob Fosse did the choreography; and this sparkler of a musical was co-directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott.  The stupendous songs include ""Hernando's Hideaway,"" ""There Once Was a Man,"" ""Small Talk,"" ""Hey There,"" and especially the exuberant ""Once a Year Day.""  Doris is at her very best, Raitt burns a hole through celluloid with a dynamic performance, and the supporting cast includes Carol Haney and Eddie Foy, Jr.  This film is as good as film musicals get and should have a much stronger reputation.  Maybe its inclusion in this huge boxed set can help.

PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES (1959) has Doris Day as a Connecticut interior decorator married to fussy, cynical Broadway drama critic David Niven, who never met a play he liked.  It's a good comedy that should have been a great one, and I'm not sure why.  Niven keeps trying to stay friends with actors and writers, particularly Janis Paige, whose work he keeps panning in print.  Richard Haydn has a great supporting role as a playwright whose work Niven pans.  This critic reminds me of vicious critic John Simon, whose drama reviews could open or close a play.  Directed in CineaScope by Charles Walters (BILLY ROSE'S JUMBO upcoming), the source here is a book by playwright Jean Kerr.  Doris even gets to sing two songs, including the title number, and the final scene is uproarious.  I still remember the wonderful mid-1960's TV sitcom version of this, starring Patricia Crowley, with great fondness from my adolescent years.  It would be lovely to have it on home video also.  Bonuses are skimpy, just a theatrical trailer.

BILLY ROSE'S JUMBO (1962) is a most pleasant and nostalgic trip to the circus, based on the 1935 show that Mr. Rose staged at the long-demolished Hippodrome in New York City.  Starring in the movie are Doris Day and Stephen Boyd as circus performers (and one can only hope they did not do their own stunts), with Jimmy Durante (from the 1935 show) and Martha Raye for comic relief.  The wonderful songs, by Rodgers and Hart, include  ""My Romance,"" ""Stardust, Spangles, and Dreams"" and the incomparable ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"".  In fact, I like the musical numbers more than the circus acts.  Director Charles Walters and screenwriter Sidney Sheldon collaborated earlier on EASTER PARADE (1948), and the circus action was choreographed by Busby Berkeley.  This Panavision production restores the original roadshow overture and also includes a hysterically funny ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoon and a 1933 Vitaphone romantic short.

Finally, THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT (1966) is an unexpectedly uproarious blend of romantic comedy, mistaken identity, and mid-1960s spy spoof from Looney Toons cartoon genius director Frank Tashlin.  Doris Day plays a NASA employee (the movie was filmed all over Cape Canaveral) who is pursued amorously by her boss, Rod Taylor.  (I think he's her boss.)  Doris' father is Arthur Godfrey, who runs a glass bottom boat tourist attraction in Catalina Island harbor, where Doris spends her summers as a mermaid.  (Could I make this up?)  She and Godfrey and Taylor sing the catchy theme song over tropical drinks.  Anyway, Day is mistaken for a Russian spy because she has a dog named Vladimir, whom she keeps calling on the phone.  (""She you tonight, Vladimir.  I love you."")  The dream comedy supporting cast pursuing our heroine includes John McGiver, Paul Lynde, Dom De Luise, Edward Andrews, Eric Fleming, and Dick Martin.  Watch for a wild party scene where one of them plants an electronic phone bug inside an hors d'ouvre that someone eats; Lynde in drag to bug the ladies' room; and conservative Andrews and Martin at sex objects in bed together.  Watch what sweet and hilarious revenge Doris plays on all of them when she realizes they falsely think she is a spy.  The legendary Leon Shamroy (the 1945 STATE FAIR, THE KING AND I) photographed in Panavision; the script is by Everett Freeman, who also produced.  Everyone looks as if they had a wonderful time making THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT, and you will have a wonderful time watching it.  DVD bonuses are generous:  a tour of NASA, a travelogue on Catalina Island, a 1966 beauty contest  winner tours 1966 MGM studios, there is the Oscar-winning cartoon ""The Dot and the Line"", and finally the theatrical trailer.

1192331,5,B000006934,"BILLY ROSE'S JUMBO makes it's long-awaited DVD release.  The movie was one of the last hig musical hurrah's from MGM, and it was also Doris Day's last movie musical role.  She shines as Kitty Wonder, the bareback-riding queen of the Wonder Circus.

Based around the classic Rodgers and Hart musical (with a new storyline devised by Sidney Sheldon).  Pop Wonder (Jimmy Durante, who also headlined the original 30s' Hippodrome production) owns the magical Wonder Circus, famous for it's star attraction, Jumbo the elephant.  His daughter Kitty, and on-again off-again squeeze Lulu (Martha Raye) complete his family.  When the mysterious Sam Rawlins (Stephen Boyd) arrives to become the new tightrope aerialist, Kitty instantly falls in love with him, but Sam hides the secret that he is the son of the Wonders' main adversary, John Noble  (Dean Jagger) owner of the Noble Circus.

Tempers and emotions run high as John Noble takes away Pop's beloved circus..and even Jumbo.  It's up to Sam to unite the feuding clans and reclaim Kitty's heart.

Lavish, tuneful entertainment.  Doris Day suits the role of Kitty to a tee and looks lovely in her Morton Haack-designed costumes.  Stephen Boyd aquits himself quite well in a rare musical role.  Jimmy Durante and Martha Raye are wonderful as feuding `odd couple' Pop and Lulu.

Several real circus acts and performers appear to add extra authenticity to the circus scenes; Doris Day performed many of her own stunts.  Songs include ""Over and Over Again"" (Day performs most of her acrobatic tricks here), ""Why Can't I?"" (beautifully staged with Day and Raye perched on the rear of a caravan traveling in the moonlight), ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"" (Day and Boyd waltz to the strains of the caliope), ""Little Girl Blue"" (Day soberly wanders the empty bigtop following the Noble takeover), ""This Can't Be Love"" (which Day triumphantly sings while riding her white horse around the bigtop), ""My Romance"" (which Day sings after Boyd saves her from a near-fatal trapeze stunt) and ""Sawdust, Spangles and Dreams"" (the rousing finale).

In the 30+ years it took for Rodgers and Hart's circus musical to get to Hollywood, the score drastically changed (the original Broadway score also included the numbers ""The Song of the Roustabouts"", ""Laugh"", ""Women"", ""Memories of Madison Square Garden"" and ""Diavolo"", all cut for various reasons) and the score was interpolated with ""This Can't Be Love"" from Rodgers and Hart's THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE.

JUMBO originally opened on Broadway in 1935, lavishly-produced by Billy Rose (hence his tribute being added to the movie title). The musical made history being staged in the huge Hippodrome and featuring many circus acts.  A real trapeze was used for some numbers.  However the show was very costly to run and it closed after 233 performances.  The original cast included famous clown `Poodles' Hanneford, Gloria Grafton and Jimmy Durante.

As an added bonus for the movie's DVD edition, the original Overture has been restored to the movie for the first time since the original theatrical engagements.  A vintage short and the original trailer are also included.  BILLY ROSE'S JUMBO is back and better than ever!",1118880000,27,3201,5.1017274472168905

1192333,5,B000006934,"Doris Day shines in this extravaganza, which was to be her last big musical; she is flawless vocally, and the melodic score contains some of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's most loved songs.

Her co-stars are equally strong, with the rambunctious pair of Jimmy Durante (as Doris' father) and Martha Raye (as Durante's ever-patient fiance), and when either of them are on the screen, it is mega-kilowatt entertainment. Nearly 30 years before this film, Durante had been in cast of the original 1934 Broadway production, and it's also wonderful to hear Martha Raye sing the ""Why Can't I ?"" duet with Doris, as her great talents as a singer were rarely recognized.

Always a favorite of mine, Stephen Boyd is excellent as Doris' love interest. His beautiful speaking voice, mellow with a slight tinge of Irish, does well with the spoken/sung intro to ""Sawdust, Spangles, and Dreams"", but his two songs (the other being ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World""), are dubbed in by the rich voice of James Joyce.

Many genuine circus acts perform throughout the film, and the stunt work for the stars is seamlessly edited in. Jumbo the elephant of course, is the 5th star of the film, and he gives a ""thumbs up"" performance.

The lavish production has many magical moments, and though most of it is pure fantasy, it captures the feel of ""on the road performers"" that anyone who has done a lot of touring in any theatrical field will appreciate.

Kudos to director Charles Winters, and cinematographer William H. Daniels for their work in this film, which is superb family entertainment. Total running time is 123 minutes.

2: ""The Circus is on Parade"" ~ Durante/Raye/Day

1192354,4,B000006934,"By 1962, the MGM movie musicals that made up one of the genre's golden ages had disappeared.  GIGI in 1958 was the last great musical from the old masters at that studio (in GIGI's case it was Arthur Freed and Vincente Minnelli), and JUMBO was pretty much the end of the trail for Joe Pasternak and Charles Walters.  Walters would go on to direct 1964's popular MOLLY BROWN, but that film is a shadow of what it could have been if the right cast had been secured (some think Doris Day was meant for Molly, and she would have been good no doubt, but it was really designed for Shirley MacLaine).  Day's last musical film was JUMBO, and, as such, it's a nifty way to say goodbye to the sunny, ebullient, effortlessly engaging actress's musical career.  Day was one of the screen's most popular and talented actresses by any standards, and seeing her in this lightweight, funny, romantic slapdash of Rodgers and Hart tunes, circus troubles, and other songs interpolated from newer sources is not a bad way to spend an evening.  The cast is very fine indeed, even the stiffer than wood Stephen Boyd, and how can you go wrong with both Jimmy Durante AND Martha Raye?  It's all very bright and has nothing at all to do with reality, which makes it work well as a movie musical.  The film includes one of the best circus numbers ever put on film - ""Over and Over Again"" - with an entire circus rehearsing their various acts to a sweeping waltz that builds and builds to ecstasy.  But there are also ""My Romance"", ""Little Girl Blue"", and ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"".

It was I think written by Roger Edens (of Judy Garland fame?), and is a mediocre imitation of Hartesque rhymes, at least in its feverish attempt at multiple rhymes at the start.  Several of the songs from the stage show were left out, as were all the verses.  Extra lyrics (not by Hart) were added to ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World"" for Durante to sing and Martha's Raye's ""The Circus Is On Parade.""  Songs from other R&H shows were interpolated.  Did someone high up like god know better than R&H what songs should be in a R&H show?  Finally, and absolutely humiliating for Martha Raye and I suspect Doris Day had a hand in it but maybe not, the line sung by Doris ""Two feet are ever cold"" is followed by Martha Raye with ""Four feet are never cold"" which in turn is followed by an embarrassed flustered ""I only mean to imply"" by Raye.  Goodness.  She said something wrong.  I am beginning to dislike Doris Day intensely.  She disgusts me.  The title of this shocking little song is ""Why Can't I?"" also not from the original show and with much excised.  The story (such as it is) is a predictable drag.  The DVD is cheap on Amazon (until you add postage), it's a flat $20 everywhere else + tax.  If you must, buy it from Amazon.  I wouldn't take it for free.  This is truly wholesome family entertainment, and that's about as nauseous a recommendation as I can give it.  If you like Rodgers and Hart, forget it.  Durante was in the original on stage.  I gave it 2 stars for the pretty tunes (and almost Roger Edens').",1114905600,,1582,4.337883959044369
1192358,5,B000006934,"If there is any question in anyone's mind as to why Doris Day is ranked by the distinguished annual Quigley Poll of top ten box-office stars, as the number one female star of all time, it will be put to rest by this great collection.

There is something for everyone contained in this beautiful set, complete with a nice array of extras.

Contained herein are films produced over a 16 year period and clearly showing that Miss Day could do it all - sing, dance, act in dramas or show a comic skill that few if any have come close to rivaling.

""Young Man With a Horn"" featuring Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall gives Miss Day a great chance to emote skillfully and to render perfect renditions of several great band tunes. It's a well-made drama and her first film to play New York's famous Radio City Music Hall. In ""Lullaby of Broadway"" she sings, dances and dazzles as only Doris can with a wonderful cast of great character performers. She also gives the best rendition of the title tune ever recorded.

""Calamity Jane"" allows Miss Day to let loose with a brilliantly executed performance as the famed woman of the wild west. She makes it her own, singing the Oscar winning ""Secret Love"" as well as delivering a powerhouse portrayal in a near perfect film co-starring Howard Keel, on loan from MGM. It's as good as anything Metro put out during their ""Golden Age"".

""Love Me or Leave Me"", opposite James Cagney, is one of the most raw, real and no-holds barred biographical films ever turned out. Miss Day should have not only been nominated for an Oscar for her unforgettable performance as 20's singer Ruth Etting but should have won the prize. Her first film at MGM enabled her to dazzle the critics and the public with a first-rate acting job by any standard as well as rendering more than a dozen songs as only she can.

""The Pajama Game"" is a near perfect screen version of a Broadway hit and Miss Day and much of the original Broadway cast perform at a breathless rate, breathing new life into some well-loved tunes. A great couple of hours of sheer entertainment.

Direct from her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Pillow Talk"", Miss Day played a mother of 4 in the screen version of Jean Kerr's hit, ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"". How many other actresses of the time at the peak of their game would have played a mother role times 4? Miss Day and co-star David Niven are completely believable in this delightful, heartwarming and completing winning romp. ""Billy Rose's Jumbo"" took 27 years to reach the screen but it was worth the wait.  The 1962 musical featuring some of Rodgers and Hart's best tunes is given the lavish MGM treatment. Miss Day, Stephen Boyd, Jimmy Durante and Martha Raye etch memorable performances in one of the last of the great MGM musicals. Finally, Miss Day had one of her biggest hits with the 1966 ""Glass Bottom Boat"". It's a wonderful slapstick comedy featuring an amazing cast of actors and comics, all set aside the background of California's Catalina Island. There are non-stop laughs and Miss Day secures her place as one of the funniest lady in film history, all the while maintaining her femininity and the endearing qualitiea that have made her an American Icon. ""The Doris Day Collection"" is a value at any price. It'll make your ""Day""!",1114819200,15,3277,4.637931034482759

Lovely music, costumes, art direction which capture the glorious age of the traveling circus in turn-of-the-20th century America. DAY, RAYE, and DURANTE are matchless.

1192382,4,B000006934,"For all its merits, ""Jumbo"" was not a perfect entity- it was released upon the twilight of film musicals; by the 60's, only adaptations of Broadway shows (""West Side Story,"" ""The Sound Of Music,"" etc.) were being done. As a result not a lot of folks saw or cared about this one when it opened, but it is one of the best microscopic exhibitions of a specialized art form (the circus). Populated with many true circus headliners, its musical portions are colorful and joyous- especially ""Circus On Parade,"" the equestrian ""This Can't Be Love,"" and the gorgeous opening number ""Over and Over Again-"" which shows off 2nd unit man Busby Berkely's cinemagraphic flourish. (Note, in particular, the final stunning pullback shot which shows all of the acts rehearshing en masse at the same time.) Ms. Day, already a top box office star due to her romantic comedies with Rock Hudson,  is gorgeous in the film and her voice can only be described as velvety. Listen especially to her solos ""My Romance,"" ""Little Girl Blue,"" and a charming duet staged with Day and Martha Raye in a wagon caravan staring out at the nighttime sky and wishing for love, ""Why Can't I?"" Portions of the film are directed too slowly and leading man Stephen Boyd is wooden, but circus owner Jummy Durante is marvelous in every scene he's in- especially where he's trying to hide an elephant!!

1192383,5,B000006934,"""Billy Rose's Jumbo"" had been planned by MGM as a vehicle for Judy Garland.  It never happened but in 1962 MGM polished off the sawdust,spangles, and dreams, gave it to famed producer Joe Pasternak and director Charles Walters, and starred the nation's number one box-office attraction, Doris Day, in the opulent and costly extravaganza. In the midst of an amazing string of box-office bonanzas, ""Jumbo"" proved to be the one weak spot for Miss Day.  It's almost incomprehensible as to why.
""Jumbo"", as it's usually known, is one of the most enjoyable musicals turned out in the 1960's, during the waning days of movie musicals. Rodgers and Hart's music has rarely been better performed.  The film is replete with romance, comedy, circus acts, and spectacle. Day, Stephen Boyd (and a voice double), Jimmy Durante, and Martha Raye, are matchless.
Durante is owner of the Pop Wonder circus, a small traveling show, that may be sold to the John Noble circus.  Noble really wants the Wonder's crown jewel, Jumbo, the elephant. Boyd is the son of Noble, who woos and wins Day, the daughter of Durante. That sums up the storyline but hardly the essence of what makes the film soar.
Doris Day never looked lovelier, in beautiful honey blonde styles by fabled stylist, Sydney Guilaroff.  She sings like a dream and did 75% of her own acrobatic and equestrian work. Durante and Raye are a joy, singing, dancing and mugging. Day's duet with Raye is perfect as are her renditions of ""My Romance"" and ""Little Girl Blue"".
The disappointing receipts for this film supposedly cost Day the lead in ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" which MGM had purchased with her in mind.  It's a shame, because ""Jumbo"" contains some of the finest work she ever put on film.  A treat for children of all ages!!",971740800,10,1773,4.8125

Billy Rose's JUMBO is a mighty talented elephant. It's also the ideal word to describe this big-time, big-top extravaganza bursting with laughter and love, sang and dance, circus stunts and star power.

Radiant Doris Day as Kitty Wonder sings beloved Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart tunes and does her own horseback riding tricks in a razzle-dazzle musical based on Billy Rose's original stage production spectacular and featuring circus sequences directed by Busby Berkeley. The story revolves around a circus owner Jimmy Durante as Anthony 'Pop' Wonder, who was the star of the 1935 Broadway original show and with only two real attractions, his daughter Kitty Wonder [Doris Day] and the popular pachyderm Jumbo the elephant. Three-ring pandemonium breaks out when a handsome rival Sam Rawlins [Stephen Boyd] infiltrates the circus, and father, daughter and Dad's wise-cracking fianc Lulu [Martha Raye] are suddenly at risk of losing the greatest show on earth!

FILM FACT No. 2: Stephen Boyd's singing voice was dubbed by James Joyce. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to the musical soon after it reached the stage. In 1947 Charles Waters requested he make the film of the musical as his first assignment; the studio agreed. In 1950 it was announced Arthur Freed would produce and Howard Keel and Jimmy Durante would star. Production was held up due to litigation. Years later Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer made the film. The film JUMBO was based on a musical play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and produced by Billy Rose and was performed at The New York Hippodrome in 1933.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Billy Roses JUMBO [1962] film is set in the early 1900s, and the Wonder Circus is run by Anthony 'Pop' Wonder [Jimmy Durante] and his daughter Kitty Wonder [Doris Day] with their main attraction Jumbo the Elephant. The circus is floundering financially and unpaid performers are quitting in droves to join other circus shows. Kitty Wonder hires a drifter Sam Rawlins [Stephen Boyd] who does odd jobs and various performances. Kitty Wonder falls for Sam Rawlins, but does he have the circuss best interest in mind?

The original musical play Jumbo had produced three hit songs: ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,"" ""Little Girl Blue"" and ""My Romance."" To those and other songs from the original score, Doris Day added another Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart standard, ""This Can't Be Love."" The numbers were filmed impeccably, with Busby Berkeley staging an impressive array of circus stunts to accompany Doris Day's first song, ""Over and Over Again,"" and director Charles Walters making the camera dance with the performers as he had in his earlier films. This wonderfully warm-hearted Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical about circus rivalries is based on showman Billy Rose's Broadway extravaganza that actually featured an elephant on the stage.

The film JUMBO is a wonderful film, artistically and technically and Doris Day was the perfect choice to play the lovely Kitty Wonder, co-owner of the Wonder Circus. The circus is near bankruptcy, due to the compulsive gambling by her father, Anthony 'Pop' Wonder and a threatened takeover by the rival Noble Circus is planned. Owner, John Noble [Dean Jaggar], plants his son, Sam Rawlins, among the Wonder Circus clan to obtain inside information in order to hasten the proposed coup. Sam Rawlins reluctantly falls in love with the beautiful young co-owner Kitty Wonder, later feels guilty about his dads underhanded tactics and decides to break with the John Noble plan.

John Noble [Dean Jaggar] is successful in his efforts and the Wonder Circus is shut down with all of its assets, including its star attraction, the incredible elephant, Jumbo, confiscated. Heartbroken and defeated, Kitty Wonder, her father and his fiance, Lulu, decide to rebuild the business from the ground level starting with two sticks and a blanket which is equivalent to dancing for pennies on a street corner. They receive an unexpected visit from Sam Rawlins who miraculously produces Jumbo and together, the four performers, with renewed confidence and ambition, roll up their sleeves and embark on a new journey.

To play Jimmy Durante's lovelorn girlfriend, Martha Raye returned to the screen after a 15-year absence during which she had become a top television star. The circus routines gave Martha Raye a chance to show off her still shapely legs, while she also shared a lyrical duet with Doris Day that reminded fans she was one of the best singers in the business. Martha Raye was so thrilled with the role that she re-located to the West Coast, hoping her part would lead to other film offers.

Throughout the JUMBO original film run, Billy Rose was besieged with claims that the plot had been stolen from a variety of sources, though nobody could make enough of a case to get even a token settlement out of him. When he was negotiating the sale of film rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, however, Ben Hecht, who was angry at Billy Rose for re-writing his script at the last minute, told studio executives that he had, indeed, borrowed the plot from another play. As a result, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dropped its offer from $200,000 to $50,000. Desperate to break even on the show, Rose had to accept. Then the studio sat on the property for almost three decades.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Warner Archive Collection has once again brought us this wonderful brilliant Blu-ray disc with a stunning 1080p Metrocolor image presentation and is helped with an equally impressive 2.40:1 aspect ratio. This Blu-ray disc also brings home all the rich detail and beautiful lush colours for which Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals were noted in a film-like presentation that confirms that the Warner Archive Collections commitment to top quality. The meticulously crafted sets and costumes of the Wonder Circus are visible in all their amazing colours. The rich primary colours are as well represented as the pastels of the butterfly costumes used for a particular act, and the deep black colour of Jumbo's cloaks and the costumes of the high-wire performer known as ""Mantino"" are deep, silky and very solid that really gives you that magical experience of both the Wonder Circus and of course this wonderful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Archive Collection brings us just one standard 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, and of course has brought this audio track up-to-date, to give you a wonderful experience and all the joys of the Circus World. The opening orchestral overture has a lushly harmonious presence, but the real magic begins with the opening chorus of circus workers hammering tent poles rhythmically into the ground, with the percussion instruments that represent the hammering are tight and precise. The overall presentation has clarity and precision beyond anything available on the live stage, even with today's sophisticated audio systems, but overall the sound tends to be with the three front speakers, but now and again you do get dramatic background sounds in the two rear speakers. Rarely have this circus film been accompanied by an orchestra of such depth and versatility. The vocal performances have been mixed very well enough and the transition from dialogue to studio-recorded singing does sound really good. So all in all Warner Archive Collection has done a superb job and brought this film bang up-to-date for new audiences to enjoy.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Jerry and Jumbo [1953] [1080p] [1.37:1] [7:05] A baby elephant rolls off the circus train and right into Tom's bed. He quickly allies himself with Jerry, and with a rolled-up trunk and some paint, passes himself off as a giant mouse. The two then keep trading places to the bafflement of Tom. This was a Tom and Jerry 74th one reel animated cartoon short, and the characters were originally created in 1951. The animated cartoon is directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and produced by Fred Quimby with music by Scott Bradley. It was animated by Kenneth Muse, Irven Spence and Ed Barge with backgrounds by Robert Gentle and was released to theatres on February 21, 1953 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Special Feature: Yours Sincerely [Musical Short] [1933] [1080i] [1.37:1] [19:35] The film Yours Sincerely is an abbreviated version of the Rodgers & Hart Broadway show Spring Is Here. Betty Braley [Nancy Welford] is being courted by several men. Although she seems to favour Terry Clayton [Richard Keene], a seemingly carefree but poor man, her independent hotelier father Peter Braley [Dudley Clements] wants her to marry a millionaire, namely Steve Alden [Lanny Ross]. Betty Braley goes along with her father's wishes and focuses her attentions on Steve Alden's romantic advances. Betty Braley's sister, Mary Jane Braley [Pearl Osgood], wants to help Terry Clayton court Betty Braley, by showing Betty Braley what she is missing in Terry Clayton by making Betty Braley jealous. In the process of Steve courting Betty Braley, and Terry pretending to court Mary Jane Braley, Steve Alden and Betty Braley do fall in love, and Terry Clayton and Mary Jane Braley also fall in love. But Steve Alden, Terry Clayton and Peter Braley aren't all that they appear on the surface. Overall it is okay, but the acting is a little stilted and as to the audio presentation, it is a very scratchy audio presentation.

Theatrical Trailer [1962] [1080i] [2.40:1] [3:19] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer of the film JUMBO and unfortunately the image presentation is not the best looking presentation, and a crying shame they could not of upgraded the print quality.

BONUS: The Original Overture has now been restored to its proper place at the start of the film, and now can be seen for the first time in more than 40 years. So what you get to view is exactly 3:45 minutes of the OVERTURE that precedes the feature film and you get to view an OVERTURE title card instead of just the usual black screen and you get to hear a compilation of the main songs in the film, with just the composed music score, so enjoy.

Finally, the film JUMBO is counted among the greatest circus film ever to come out of Hollywood and is compared to such films as The Greatest Show on Earth, Trapeze, Carnival Story and Circus World. Charles Walters directed the picture with Joe Pasternak and Martin Melcher producing. Doris Day was nominated as Best actress in a musical or comedy at the Hollywood Foreign Press Awards but lost to Rosalind Russell for Gypsy. However, Doris Day walked away with the evenings coveted Worlds Most Popular Film Actress accolade again. Meanwhile, Billy Rose's JUMBO film is highly recommended as a superior Blu-ray presentation of a well-crafted Hollywood musical that will bring so much joy to a new generation.

7903843,4,B000006934,"This Blu-Ray is for sure a stunning color restoration of this film. If you like Jumbo you'll love this disc. For me though, this late-in-the-day, tired product of the faltering studio system is more than bad. In its own way it's tragic.
But that's me. Highly recommended for the beautiful restored color image.

BTW, the listing for this is confused. This is not ""multi-format."" This a Blu-Ray only release.",1504483200,,407,4.898550724637682
