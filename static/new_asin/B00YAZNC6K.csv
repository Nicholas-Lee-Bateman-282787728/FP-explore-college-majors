8717911,4,B00YAZNC6K,"When I first saw this DVD listed in ""Amazon"" I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but took a chance anyway. It definitely Is interesting with comical parts scattered through out the movie along with serious parts. The story line isn't much, but it still becomes a 'Saved' disc in my collection for later viewing several times more.
Additionally, there are several changes between scenes that almost appear as data corruption as some scenes begin to fade for an instant in change overs, but these may be the way the movie was made. I'm just not sure, but they don't distract from the movie, nor do these changes completely stop for more than a few seconds then the movie continues on its own through the machine.

The bottom line is: Get the movie.",1488672000,2,740,4.56390977443609
