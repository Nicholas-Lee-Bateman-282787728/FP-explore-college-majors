8225825,5,B000WVQ0C4,"This video is fantastic, regardless of whether or not you have kids.  To live like a temporary local (to borrow a Rick Steve's phrase) you need to venture beyond Cancun.  This video really shows you how.  I read all of the guide books I could find and this video was the best place to start my planning.  I'd suggest considering Ek Balam and Celestun which were not covered in the video, but otherwise, their trip is a great blueprint for enjoying the Yucatan.",1301875200,,460,4.506024096385542
8225826,5,B000WVQ0C4,"To prepare for a trip to the Yucatan (from which my wife and I returned last week), I rented several DVDs about the Yucatan from the local library (sorry Amazon!).  My wife and I don't have kids, but there weren't all that many videos to choose from and the cover mentioned several places we were planning on seeing, so we figured what the heck.  As it turned out, this video was by far the most educational and entertaining of the DVDs we rented.  Lots of information (everything from prices to historical and cultural info) and virtually every important site in the Yucatan was covered: this family must've had a busy trip!  About the only site which was a notable omission was Uxmal, which is an easy day trip from Merida.  Otherwise, this video had pretty much every place covered that a vacationer to the Yucatan could think of, including Cancun, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen, Chichen Itza, Valladolid, Merida, Izamal, Tulum, and more.  We even stayed at the same Merida hotel (Casa del Balam) and enjoyed it greatly.  Again, even though we don't have kids, the kids were cute and we enjoyed the perspective of the youngsters.  We even started quoting the kids a bit ... ""when will chocolate cake come?"" was our favorite.  I don't know what that says about us!

Unless you confine yourself to the touristy Cancun area, you'll need more than this video to plan your trip.  But at the same time, the dry text of tour books does not always do justice to many of these places.  Whether you have kids or not, I'd recommend watching this video to anyone planning a trip to the Yucatan.  I was especially pleased to see so much coverage of the sites away from the coast--that is, ""real"" Mexico.  The Yucatan gets an unfair reputation for just being a crowded, Americanized place of beaches and parties, due to the spring break crowd.  While the Yucatan does have these attractions (and for many people, that alone is enough), there is much more for the traveler to discover if he or she makes the effort to dig beneath the surface even just a little.  Hats off to this video for making the treasures of the Yucatan accessible to travelers of all interests and ages.",1238284800,2,2160,4.615183246073299
8225827,4,B000WVQ0C4,"Good basic info for multiple cities on the Yucatan.  Lists at least one family oriented recommended hotel and one sight per city.  Keeps it focused on a few fun things you might like to do with kids in tow.  Does not cover it all so you need to supplement your planning with a guidebook.  But for a video to get a kid interested in ""what is Mexico"" for your upcoming trip this is just the ticket.",1220054400,3,396,4.171052631578948
8225828,5,B000WVQ0C4,"I picked this up this dvd along with a tour book for our upcoming trip to Playa Del Carmen.  I really expected to watch it once (for sightseeing ideas) and then put it on ebay.  My daughter, who just turned 4, will not part with it.  She has watched it over and over again and picks repeatedly over every other favorite t.v. show and movie we own (and she only gets about an hour of t.v. time a day).
The dvd is loaded with silly laughs and fun learning for little kids along with real history and practical tips for the grownups.  It's definitely helped us define our plans for our week in that part of Mexico. My daughter is as excited as us about our coming trip because she knows what to expect and can't wait to see it for herself!",1191715200,9,736,4.161971830985915
