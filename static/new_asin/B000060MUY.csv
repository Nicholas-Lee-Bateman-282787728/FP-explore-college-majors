1681041,1,B000060MUY,"There are a few good minutes to this film but you have to sit through about 100 bad minutes. The acting is amateurish and there was no clicking between the actors. You can tell Monet did the movie just to collect a paycheck and had no interest in playing the part or interacting with the other characters. There are also many inconsistencies in the movie as well. Some examples are: The PCH driving scene (Which is way too long!!) starts in the middle of the day and finally ends up well after dark (Probably needed to stop for gas at least twice). Monet buys groceries at the grocery store and the checkout girl did not use the scanner and a total did not pop up on the monitor. The whole councilman arrest scene at the nightclub made no sense. Why would a corrupt councilman take a bribe in front of an ultra clean councilman? Why would the FBI make a bust in a crowded nightclub when the could of done it out side without the shooting and injuries to bystanders. Oh finally, didn't anybody count the bullets? There were so many bullets fired but no one changed clips. There are so many more inconsistencies I won't bore you with them like the movie. In short, the movie looks like a bunch of short clips sewn together.",1023062400,5,1221,4.407079646017699
1681042,4,B000060MUY,"Mr Schwab's strengths shown through as a director. The action sequences are worth the rental in itself. There are two amzaing scenes (1) high speed car race through the mountains of California and (2) the climax in the LA subway.
One other notable is Monet Mazur who is destined to major stardom.",1021766400,3,296,4.711538461538462
1681043,5,B000060MUY,"I watched this film at my girlfriend's house the other night. I asked her way she bought it and she said her friends recommended it. Now I know why. The acting was really good. It had a nice combination of action and romance. The cinematography was the best I've seen in years. The director really put it all together into well balanced, well orchestrated film that keeps you interested through out. The climatic scene in the movie was outstanding and kept me on the end of my seat. It's solid and I recommend it.",1020124800,2,513,4.468085106382978
1681044,5,B000060MUY,I did not see the movie in the theater but I'm glad I got to see it the privacy of my home. The plot was well thought out and kept you entertained for 2 hours. I wish they could have made it a little longer to further develop certain scenes. The directing was excellent and cinematography was nearly flawless. The music was great so I suggest you get your copy on DVD if possible. This is definitely a movie for the collection.,1019779200,4,427,4.219512195121951
1681045,2,B000060MUY,"Eric Schwab, the finest up and coming director in Hollywood, puts out an ok film on a relatively low budget. The actors are some of the newest in Hollywood (You can tell). The film didn't get many viewers in theaters because it came out the week of 9/11 but the professional reviews at that time were mostly unfavorable. I can see why.",1019606400,3,335,4.419354838709677
1681046,4,B000060MUY,"This is a fast action sexy movie about two kids learning the ropes and how to wheel and deal the real game of suspense. The highs and the costs.  We all have had our learning curves, this one just has a real MESSAGE.  The actors do a great job, lighting and cinematrography, great Los Angles photos,,,  worth the 2 hours...",1018656000,4,323,4.35
1681047,5,B000060MUY,This is a great movie.  The plot was so cool.  I plan to go to LA and I bet that's the way it really could be. What a babe Money Mazur is. I also saw her in 40 Days but here she's got a whole movie.  That's the kind of girl I want when I get out there. Vincent Ventresca (who I see as the Invisible Man lol :) is really great also.  He gives a hard edge which I like.  LA just looks like a great place.  And I thought all the car driving and shoot out stuff were really good.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Can anyone tell me where that nightclub is?,1017792000,4,549,3.6724137931034484

1681049,4,B000060MUY,"I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was. The characters had just enough quirk to make them interesting, especially Vincent Ventresca as Marshal, who stole the show during his on-screen time.
My only problem with this movie was that there were times were things were progressing way too fast. This is most prevalent in the begining of the movie. But as soon as the introductions are over, the flow begins to fall into place nicely.
I recomend this movie for those looking for an interesting indepenent film starring some great, up and coming actors.",1017014400,4,583,4.782178217821782

7957381,1,B000060MUY,"I bought the film at a low price, seeing that it featured Monet Mazur, who I adored from another movie.  Big mistake; she is attractive but by no means capable of ""carrying"" a picture.  The film is a confused mess, the type of film they often create in Europe when they have funding, a cast, a producer, but no plotline, theme, or plausible dialogue.  I wish I could recommend a better form of this type of film(genre), but I can't characterize it at all.",1280361600,,455,4.392857142857143
7957382,4,B000060MUY,"I must admit that the only reason I bought this movie was because of Carmine Giovinazzo.  I wasn't expecting it to be anything more than mediocre, but I actually did end up liking it.  It's no blockbuster, but it has its good points.  It's incredibly cheesy, but still somewhat likable.  It's not a bad buy for the price listed.",1279756800,,328,4.508474576271187
7957383,3,B000060MUY,"THE LEARNING CURVE (2001) is a surprise success considering its
lack of big box office stars. Let this not deter anyone from
renting this DVD, as it packs plenty of entertainment and then
some.

The story will often appeal on the visual and intellectual aspects,
although there is a fair bit of action, too.

The cast does a splendid and convincing job over the entire 90
mins, comprising Monet Mazur as the bored daughter of a richman
(reminiscent of Darryl Hanna), Vincent Ventresca (somewhat of a
Kyle MacLachlan clone), Carmine Giovinazzo as the street smart guy
and Steve Bauer as the ""tough enforcer"" of the organization.
Mazur's role is that of a woman who is effective, efficient, fast,
confident, experienced in engaging and seducing men of all kinds,
and them playing them for their wealth, for the illusion of
romance and or of a personal relationship.

The visual aspects are excellent, although the release is not a
wide-screen. There's plenty of exciting, energetic moments,
including race car dare-devil behavior on the highway, near the
edges of a cliff, and more bringing an upbeat, positive feeling in
the early minutes.

The soundtrack is talented and tasteful, as are the visuals, in
capturing a variety of moods (melancholy, joy, ecstasy,
irresponsability, remorse, recklessness, etc) on screen, such as in
the darker outdoor night or indoor club scenes.

Skillfully, the move wastes no time in showing the evolution of
Mazur and Giovinazzo, from 2 youngsters ridding themselves of their
boredom by running small-time con jobs, grifts by setting up their
marks for the scores, that drives their libidos in an ever
increasing crescendo. Nothing is off their limits, from insurance
claims for a simulated accident, to sex entrapment, arson, etc.

This continues until their talent brings them to the big leagues,
to the attention of Ventresca who's a bigger player, wishing to
leverage their talent for his major real estate deal.

The developer plans to convert a run down and neglected part of the
city into a new project, that many oppose, including the municipal
politicans and some small stores.

The solution lies in power-brokering a deal with the right people,
using the right tactics, including blackmail over sex, offering
gifts and success of the right kind to the right people, including
cash.

For those familiar with sustainable development, use and misuse of
new eminent domain laws to override the 5th Amendment of the US
Constitution, stating ""private property shall not be taken for
public use, without just compensation"", the payoffs and
powerbrokering occurring sound realistic.

The action, chases, gun fire fights are good enough to shake the
audience's socks off.

A funny quip: "" I sure you're too young for a lot of things, but I
bet that sure doesn't stop you! It's the grease that keeps the
gears going.""

The moral lesson is present, as Mazur makes the choice of resisting
a pure role of prostitute in the deal, limiting herself to her
hitherto comfortable role of fleecer. Some personal feelings also
surface, questioning her mind also about what is right and wrong.

An intriguing question is left with the audience, in terms of
Mazur's prolonged anguish ... is the reaction of the character
real, when she had scored so many marks on so many cons, for so
long a time, with contemptible tactics and no remorse all that time?",1270166400,,3373,5.01252236135957
7957384,4,B000060MUY,"I LOVED this film and found it thoroughly enjoyable. It drew me in and kept me watching. To see these characters go through the changes they go through was truly amazing to me. Monet Mazur was wonderful as well as geogeous and Carmine Giovinazzo did a great job along with Vincent Ventresca who plays his character to the edge. I thought the film was well cast, the acting was superb, the locations were amazing and the story original. Just sit back and enjoy the ride because this one is worth the trip. I give it thumbs up. If you can't enjoy this film you're looking waaay to deep. Relax and enjoy.",1059004800,2,601,4.423423423423423
7957385,1,B000060MUY,"I'm not sure why I decided to buy this flick - probably the low price and the positive reviews.
It turned out to be a mistake.
This movie is awful. Although I like ""B"" movies and direct-to-video  titles that are fun to watch, either because of a good storyline or great actors, this movie has none of those things. The story is weak, the acting is uninspired, and the direction is atrocious.
Those reviews saying this movie is awesome have to be shills - no way. AVOID.",1040688000,7,469,4.390804597701149
