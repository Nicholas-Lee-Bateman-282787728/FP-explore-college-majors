8092581,1,B000BTPVAY,"What a major rip-off... am I the only one that only got one disc?
For a whopping 22.00 bucks! -- You are left hanging...

Update:  Now it states in itsy-bitsy print disk 1 of 2 after I called Amazon and complained.  Try and find the 2nd disc on Amazon - I have and cannot find it available.  When I called Amazon customer service the gal told me the 2nd disc was to be with disc one... I called Philip Montrose and he said no they are sold separately but they do not sell the dvd's themselves... soooo????  He reluctantly offered to send me one but said he does not usually do this.

Not ... a Happy Camper on this one.  The Disk I got also had 2 severe glitches in it... defective.  Gas/Time/Money to ship it back to Amazon.",1377302400,8,725,4.16546762589928
8092582,5,B000BTPVAY,"EFT (Emotional Freedome Technique) is a stress release technique that involves tapping gently on a few easily reachable accupuncture spots on your body while focusing on your problems. This dvd does a great job of teaching the technique and includes real-life demonstrations of using the technique to releave problems.  The people in the demonstrations are diverse.  I believe this technique has value in relieving the daily stress of racism as well as other ""ism""s.  The production is a bit dated and the delivery can be a bit stiff but the Mountroses are sincere and thorough teachers.  I have several dvd's on EFT and this one and those produced by Gary Craig (the founder of EFT) are the best.  Gary Craig'd dvd's are no longer available for purchase but can be rented.",1330214400,5,773,4.870229007633588
8092583,3,B000BTPVAY,"This video was very informative about EFT. It explains the history of EFT, techniques of tapping, and shows practices of EFT with clients. However, this video is about as attention capturing as watching paint dry while eating unsalted saltine crackers, and I found it hard to stay awake to watch all the way through. I think it might be discouraging for some people new to EFT to watch simply because it is so dry and boring.",1290124800,8,425,4.605263157894737
8092584,5,B000BTPVAY,"I watched this dvd again the other day.  I hadn't seen it for about 2 years, since I first got it.  I was having problems getting rid of a resentment I had against someone.  I was so bothered by my feelings, I couldn't sleep.  Then I had the thought 'why not tap on it?'  I popped in the dvd to refresh my memory on the simple technique.  In a few minutes, I was tapping and feeling relief.  Before I started tapping, my anger was about an 8-9 on a 0-10 scale.  After a few minutes, it was down to a 2, and then as the night progressed, my anger completely slipped away.

I like and recommend this dvd because I got the visual that a book (no matter how well written) doesn't provide.

This is really amazing.",1276214400,14,709,4.109489051094891
8092585,5,B000BTPVAY,I have been tinkering with EFT for a short time and this is just amazing what this technique can do. This video is clear and demonstrates how to do the method. I highly recommend.,1224806400,20,179,4.294117647058823
8092586,5,B000BTPVAY,"Because EFT is partly a PHYSICAL  technique, it is so helpful to be able to watch how it works.  I really appreciate the Mountrose's effort in bringing the EFT technique to DVD for a reasonable price.  I could feel their sincerity and enthusiasm for the process.  It is not a fancy video, just good instruction and demonstration.  It looks like they are working with clients in their home.  If you are not ready to invest in the videos from Gary Craig the founder of EFT, then you can't go wrong with this DVD.",1219708800,38,510,4.43010752688172
8092587,4,B000BTPVAY,YES!  I popped it in and after getting passed the wallpaper and wardrobe --- I learned how to do EFT.  It was so much better than a book or CD.  I could see it all and now I practice it on any resistance.,1166140800,36,204,3.697674418604651
8092588,5,B000BTPVAY,"The authors of these videotapes provide clear, concise, and easy to follow instructions and demonstrations with people in real life.  The videos are excellent for lay people and professionals who are interested in using the techniques. As a health care professional, I have contact with many ""glossy-type"" presentations who tout the practitioner and not the subject.  Not so with these two.  Phil has a background in teaching disabled children.  They break down the steps to make it easy for the learner.  I have four other courses on this technique, but none surpass the simple, direct and easy presentation that the Mountrouses provide.  Linda Erlin, RN,CS, MFT",1106006400,16,663,5.2075471698113205
8092589,5,B000BTPVAY,"This tape has enabled me to release an enormous amount of anger and resentment (divorce). Having watched this tape and simultaneously performed the techniques with my own emotional issues, I was able to release most of the negative energies and actually feel optimistic. Rather than despise my opponents, I began to see them in a different perspective. If you need to release pain, hostility, or other emotional traumas, these techniques are very simple to perform and will provide you with immediate benefits of peace as well as a more positive outlook. Good luck in your healing journey! May your days be filled with joy!",1039392000,22,623,5.0
8092590,5,B000BTPVAY,"This is the Perfect tool for those who have difficulty learning from books.  The authors are so seamless in their execution of EFT techniques that viewers need no prior understanding of the subject matter. As I followed along with the illustrations, I was able to gain skill, competence and results in one session!  I will be anxiously awaiting more videos produced by the Mountroses.  They are well qualified and clearly comitted to helping others toward quick and lasting change!",972000000,27,481,5.063291139240507
