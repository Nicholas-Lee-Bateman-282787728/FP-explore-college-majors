I will rehash this review because I own all of the classic monster movies such as Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man The streaming ones in HD are top quality. You see every detail including when the Monster throws the lil girl into the lake. I own these movies on DVD, Blu-Ray and now streaming which I enjoy more because I can setup my own monsterthon and do as lil work as possible setting it up.",1486944000,,498,4.544444444444444

2999132,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is an outstanding set of discs. An essential for horror movie buffs and anyone interested in  classic silent films in general. Kino has improved on the previous dvd edition with a fine restored image on disc 1. The 16mm version of what is mostly the original film is on disc 2 (no negative exists of the original 35 mm film, explained in the marvelous supplemental running commentary which also offers tons of fascinating information about the film's releasing history and the genius of Lon Chaney).The uncut original silent  contains tons of speckles, streak marks and some emulsion damage, but it fills out the story and adds much more to character development, and as a result is somewhat longer.

This Gothic melodrama becomes.a bit silly toward the end but never fails to be less that an impressive spectacle, even when viewed with 21st century eyes.  It is best in its first acts as it builds a mood of dread and mystery surrounding the figure of the Phantom.  The Masked Ball, at which the Phantom appears as the Red Death, is particularly fascinating with its primitive coloring techniques.  And, of course, this film features arguably the most famous makeup job in all of cinema history.  The backstage areas of the Opera House and the labyrinthine catacombs are masterpieces of set design, setting a surreal stage and influencing cinema for decades to come.",1457049600,,822,5.014705882352941

It is out-of-alignment by minutes, not seconds, which is truly inexcusable.  If you want to hear the Gaylord Carter score presented properly, you will have to buy the Image Entertainment (2011) edition.  In every other aspect, particularly the obvious clean-up of the 20 frames per second presentation with its excellent Gabriel Thibaudeau score, this Kino Classics edition is superior to the Image Entertainment edition.

Edit: I have watched the DVD, and while it is unscratched, the music is not the same as the original silent film.

2999161,5,B000X7SD6S,"The Phantom of the Opera is the original silent feature film that inspired successive remakes and a Broadway musical. Lon Chaney, the Man of a Thousand Faces stars as Erik, the horribly disfigured man who haunts the passageways and underground chambers of the Paris Opera.

The story is simple. Erik is infatuated with soprano Christine Daae (Mary Philbin), understudy to the opera's star diva, Carlota. Through threats and intimidation and, eventually, more drastic means, the Phantom forces the opera management to let Christine perform. But this isn't enough for him. The Phantom kidnaps her and takes her into the depths of the operas sub-basements, where he lives and keeps a shrine devoted to Christine. Deep underground, alone with the Phantom, there is little chance of rescue. Norman Kerry stars as Raoul, Christines beloved, and Arthur Edmund Carewe appears as Ledoux, a mysterious presence who pops up here and there, his purpose not realized until late in the film.

This is Chaneys masterpiece, with make-up that is still frightening today. Chaney inserted discs into his nostrils to flare them, and had fish wire hold his mouth open so it could not be closed. With additional facial make-up and hairpiece, his Phantom takes on the appearance of a living cadaver.

This original version far outshines later tellings of the same story. The sets, in particular, are sumptuous and stood for decades on the Universal lot as the Phantom stage.

The Blu-ray release presents the 1929 theatrical version, restored from archival 35-millimeter elements, highlighted by the Technicolor Bal Masque sequence (in which the Phantom interrupts the revelry in the scarlet robes of the Red Death) and several meticulously hand-colored sequences. This Blu-ray release offers the film in two historically accurate projection speeds (each with two different soundtrack options). Bonus content includes the 1925 theatrical cut, which contains scenes that were removed from the 1929 release version, and lengthy excerpts from the 1930 sound version, which no longer survives intact.",1450569600,,2073,5.3496932515337425

There is an informative commentary supporting the 1929 re-release on the first disc plus the original 1925 version, in rough shape, on the second. Picture elements are from the 1929 export version, and because the available soundtrack for the 1929 re-release doesn't match this cut, it is presented (very effectively) as the silent picture, as it was created. The picture restoration and the soundtracks are excellent, so this release is highly recommended.",1448064000,,616,5.295918367346939

2999168,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is a major movie of the Universal Studio and it was well regarded upon its release in 1925. It was showing twice a day and packed every showing with reservations running for months. This Chaney vehicle was a big success financially for Universal Studios. One of the greatest horror-films ever made and certainly it remains at the pinnacle of all films produced during silent era. Chaney was on loan from MGM and he shattered audiences threshold for fear with his most grotesque face. His existence in the catacombs and dungeons beneath the Paris Opera not only terrified audiences but also the pretty young actress Mary Philbin. The actual Opera House was constructed at the Universal City containing five tiers of balcony and seating 3000 extras. Norman Kerry played Raoul, the fianc&eacute;e of Philbin. It was brilliantly directed by Rupert Julian, but he had to depart for the last scene since lead actor Lon Chaney did not agree with the director about the finale of the story. Edward Sedgwick was called in to shoot the final chase scene which totally engaged the theater audiences for the ultimate demise of the ugly and terrifying creature.

Lon Chaney charms as a super star and the movie itself is a masterpiece. I highly recommend this to all fans of Lon Chaney and horror films in general. Anyone interested in the silent era movies and in golden age of Hollywood would also appreciate this work.",1446595200,,1413,4.863070539419087
2999169,3,B000X7SD6S,"This review refers to the 2015 Blu Ray disc of ""The Phantom of The Opera"".

I absolutely love Kino and all the wonderful things they've done for my film collection over the years, so it pains me to say that this isn't a very compelling Blu Ray disc. The print isn't in very good shape, and when transferred to video, the center of the image seems to have been a bit ""lifted"" from the gate, so the edges are in sharp focus, but the center is a bit blurred.

This alone would have bothered me, but I also have the BFI Blu Ray of the same film (it's an import from Europe), and the image quality on that disc is absolutely stunning. That disc also features a surround-sound orchestral score from Carl Davis, which is much better than either stereo soundtrack on the Kino blu ray (as much as I enjoy the Alloy Orchestra, this score is just run-of-the-mill). In fact, the BFI disc is so good that when I compared the Kino to the BFI just out of curiosity, I ended up watching the whole BFI movie.

Having the film available on the Kino disc in two speeds (20fps and 24fps) sounds great, but the 20fps version suffers from the ""stuttering"" motion that others have complained about when referring to the earlier Milestone DVD. The motions of people do look more natural, but the stuttering is just too distracting. The BFI blu ray has a wee bit of the stuttering effect, but it's not objectionable.

Both the BFI and Kino versions have one reel of the 1929 sound release that was discovered recently in the Library of Congress. It's really interesting and is of the same quality on both presentations.

The Kino version has a great 53-minute extra that contains a lot of the 1929 audio track to listen to. When appropriate, it's synced to footage from the 1929 film, but for the most part it's just audio. Still worth listening to, though.

Again, I don't like criticizing Kino*, but this disc ain't the one to get. Buy the BFI import from amazon.co.uk if it's still available; you won't regret it. (NOTE: The BFI print is region-free, but it includes a PAL DVD version of the whole package as well, and also a PAL DVD of the ""Lon Chaney: Man Of A Thousand Faces"" documentary from TCM and Kevin Brownlow. If your bluray player can't handle PAL DVDs, you won't be able to view these two DVDs.)

* my package also contained ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" from Kino on Blu ray, and that disc is stunning!",1445558400,,2386,4.433789954337899
2999170,5,B000X7SD6S,"a great classic movie, one of the best. Lon Chaney at the top of the list as one of the best",1445212800,,92,3.4285714285714284
2999171,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is for the new(2015) Kino two disc edition of the Phantom of the Opera. Kino of course issues nothing but quality releases and should be commended for another fine job here with the Phantom.
The story is by now a well known one. The Paris Opera House sits over the multi-layered catacombs of passages long closed,but with their own sinister histories. The House itself is being sold to new owners who,after sale,hear of its' possible association with a phantom ghost that frequents its floors. The opera's main contralto has received lettered threats from this phantom not to sing in its upcoming show,but to let a new up and comer do so,Christine Daee'. She does so, to much acclaim and rebukes her boyfriends pleas to marry him,telling him she must stay true to her art. However what he does not realize is that she has been getting help from a mysterious cloaked figure behind the scenes,and it is he that has propelled her career to the heights it is now.
The Phantom one day decides it is time that Christine meet him in person,and he does so by telling her to walk into her dressing room mirror. Once through she finds herself in the catacombs and facing a cloaked but masked figure. She is repelled by his visage but he pleads with her not to judge her by his appearance but by his love for her and her career. He takes her far below the Opera House to his lair. There he keeps her, warning her not to touch his mask. When she wakes the next day she finds him playing the organ. She listens but cannot control her urge to see what is under the mask. When she lifts it he stands and turns. She is horrified,falls to the floor and can barely speak. After much pleading the Phantom eventually relents and allows her to return to the Opera House above. But he warns that she must never see her boyfriend again.
Once back above Christine sends for her boyfriend and asks him to rescue her from the Phantom's grip. During a grand ball at the Opera House the Phantom appears dressed in a bright red cape and wearing the mask of death. He spies the two together and leaves. Later on the Opera roof the two talk and agree to leave after that night's performance. However the Phantom is above listening and will kibosh the plan.
Acting proactively,he snatches her during the performance after people's attention are focused on the huge chandelier which has fallen into the stunned crowd below(his doing of course).He takes her back down to his lair and fends off attempts by would be rescuers. One of them is her boyfriend,whom she saves by agreeing to stay with the Phantom forever. However a frenzied mob also in pursuit of the girl and her captor rush his lair and he is forced to flee with Christine in a carriage above. During his getaway Christine is thrown free and the carriage goes but a little further until a wheel comes loose and the Phantom is at the mercy of the crowd. He at first keeps them at bay with a clutched hand,feigning that he has an explosive in it. When he reveals an empty hand,laughing madly,the crowd pounces on him,works him over and throws his apparently lifeless body into the Seine river.
It is certainly a compelling story. The acting however can appear to be a bit too melodramatic at times and tends to interfere with the mood. Chaney,as always,is the center the movie pivots on and he is marvelous to behold. His costume changes and facial effects are astonishing even today,as was his acting. Just simple hand gestures signified so much when Chaney was in control.
This new two disc set includes really THREE versions of the Phantom. The 1929 re-release in a 20-fps or 24 fps,format. For me the 20 fps mimicked a more natural movement by all concerned ,so I found it the more pleasing of the two. It also includes the original 1925 version which really is the ONE to watch, as the re-release was edited slightly differently than the original, with the original much more explanatory with its characters and their relationship to each other. Remember though , the famous Technicolour sequence can only be found in the 1929 release.
All the prints can at times be""rough""looking,so one must consider their ages when viewing these films.
Extras include excerpts from the 1930 Sound Version(sound on disc,with only part of the film extant),the original trailer,the original screenplay,an interview with the composer of the new music track and two travelogue films from 1925 Paris.
All in all a wonderful re-release by Kino of the original Phantom of the Opera. As the market stands right now,THIS is the version to own. There just are not any better versions of this film anywhere,and there probably will not be for years to come. Highly recommended.",1445126400,,4686,4.6606280193236715

2999199,5,B000X7SD6S,"Up to now, I'd never seen the entireity of Lon Chaney's portrayal!  I'd only remembered seeing pictures of him as the Phantom in a book of movie monsters in a neighbor's house growing up as a kid.  Of course, even then, I was rivetted, mesmerized.

His Phantom is undoubtedly the scariest-LOOKING Phantom of all the stage and screen incarnations, thanks to his own grotesque prosthetic makeup, with a face that is essentially a rotten corpse, a skeleton...with eyes.  And his use of his hands and fingers is positively insidious.  Later actor Ian McDiarmid, who portrayed the Emperor in the Star Wars movies, was no doubt inspired by Lon Chaney's Phantom!

There are three versions of the film on blu-ray:

Version 1 is clearly the best-looking print, with the least amount of speckles, dirt, scratches and other damage.

Version 2 is a slightly inferior print, but has by far THE BEST musical score.  The music really captures the plight and tragedy of the Phantom, his being condemned to an eternity of isolation due to his hideous face, and his unrequited love for Christine, who begs him that she'll be his eternal slave if only he releases her, then promptly goes to her lover Raoul and begs him to take her and flee.

Version 3 looks the worst of the three versions, essentially like a PAL VHS, unworthy of blu-ray release, except that it is apparently the only archival version of the original 1925 cut.

Versions 1 and 2 are ""reissue"" cuts, apparently made from European release print masters, which I actually prefer, not only for their improved visual quality but for their extensions in scenes of certain dramatic moments, longer musical numbers and better placement of the camera.  There were reportedly, according to the excellent commentary track in version 2, two cameras filming Phantom at the same time, one for the U.S. release print, one for the European release print.  This is especially evident during the Phantom's ""reveal"", when Christine pulls his mask off to reveal his grotesque face and as he subsequently towers over her (us, in her point of view).  In the 1925 version, the Phantom is looking off-camera...and it's not as scary.  And there are more closeups of the Phantom hovering above Christine and Raoul in the towering gargoyle statue above them in the 1929 reissue versions than in the 1925 version.

2999203,4,B000X7SD6S,"After a reviewer's review told me that his DVD with the 1929 re-release of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA had lovely colour tinting of the black and white done in 1929 of the film and a great music score composed by Gabriel Thibaudoux for the movie, I ordered this re-release title and I was immediatly delighted by the score, and the silent movie performances such as the frightened ballet dancers with them running in fear of the phantom accompanied by the running music, the comic releif stagehand and the other stagehand, Bouquet with his scarey description of the mysterious Phantom. While most of the actors are not in the same class as Lon Chaney they have good humourous moments and keep the story moving well. And the tinted colours are used to good effect whether it's a night blue for outdoor night scences or a hot red colour for when the Phantom tries to roast the undercover police agent and Christine's boyfriend who loves Christine, the opera singer that the Phantom wants for himself! Whenever rival opera singer Carlotta's stage mother  enters a scene the music sounds like, "" the General has entered the building!"" and plays like a military march which matches the broad gestures of a diva stage mother who is used to getting her own way! When Christine was first spoken to by the Phantom with a melodious sound, according to the title cards, the music used a strange, errie sound witha hypnotic feel and after the Phantom has played his organ the music burst into loud, rising notes that seem to echo the Phantom's mocking laugh after Christine has ripped off his mask and witnessed his gruesome face!

But then Chaney covered his face in dispair and his expression dropped down into a look of sheer pain and sorrow. Lon Chaney had such control over every gesture and expression of not just his face but his whole body! It's not just WHAT he did with his hands but HOW he did it! How he moved from being rejected to a look of wicked glee as he schemed of what he would do next to his pursuers I found so fasinating!! But Mary Philbin's Christine performence so sadly went downhill! While Chaney is so convincing as the Phantom with a tortured soul, Mary as Christine kept clasping her hands repeatedly (how many times did she do that!?) and her attempts at acting frightened led to some pretty bad facial expressions! Her best moment was when she started reaching to pull off Chaney's plastic mask! She slowly moved her hands forward, then pulled her hands back before trying again while her eyes showed she was truly curious as to what his face looked like! She actually had good subtle performance moves there!

But the rest of her movie performance is an embarassment! At times her acting reminded me of ""Lucy Ricardo"" trying to break into ""Ricky's"" act in I LOVE LUCY if you know what I mean! She is the ""fly in the ointment!"" But I enjoyed everyone else! The Masque ball 2 strip techicolour scene I compared to Roger Corman's MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH movie starring Vincent Price! Vincent Price's performence as THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES was clearly modeled after Chaney's PHANTOM! The music added a macabre feeling to the Phantom's entrance as the costumed Red Death complete with a skull face!

The final moment (Spoiler Alert!) showed the Phantom cornered in front of a river and he managed to frighten the angry mob by pretending to have a bomb consealed in his fist! But then he opened his hand to reveal there was nothing there! Chaney laughed as if to say,"" I fooled you again!"" before the mob beat him up and threw him in the river! The Phantom was a tragic trickster and a frightening, sad, rejected man thanks to the performence skills of Lon Chaney!",1397606400,,3674,4.639016897081413

2999206,5,B000X7SD6S,"When one is going to watch a silent film on DVD in the 21st century, two things are of paramount importance:  the quality of the image restoration, and the soundtrack that accompanies the film.  This most excellent DVD contains THREE versions of the film:
  1.  The 1929 reissue version (24 frames per second), expertly restored, with musical score by the ALLOY ORCHESTRA or Gaylord Carter's organ score;
  2.  The 1929 Reissue version (20 frames per second) with Gabriel Thibodeau's orchestral score; and
  3.  The original 1925 version, with a piano score by Frederick Hodges.

Thanks ENORMOUSLY to the other reviewer who posted a scan of the back cover, giving us information that Amazon couldn't be bothered to provide.

The importance of the musical score cannot be overstated.  The first time I saw Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, it was in a little silent-movie theater with live organ accompaniment, and I was absolutely blown away, despite the poor quality of the film they had.  The next time I saw it was on an early VHS release and I was utterly let down -- the image quality was marginally better, but the ""accompaniment"" was just some cheap, public-domain ""classical"" stuff that sawed on dolefully in the background without any reference to what was happening in the film.  It was a horrible, soporific experience.

THAT BEING SAID, the Alloy Orchestra is the absolute best for accompanying silent films.  NOBODY else comes close, except for live accompanists who are watching the screen and using the music to properly underscore and enhance what's happening.  This DVD (specifically version 1 with the Alloy score) is to my mind the perfect PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, at last.  If you like this, be sure to get their version of Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL as well.  And now, if ONLY we could get their METROPOLIS score as the soundtrack to a beautifully-restored DVD ... sigh!",1390348800,,1880,4.923566878980892

Lon Cahney is the most ghastly phantom by far and follows closely what Leroux described in his book.

The choice she is given, to turn a scorpion or a grasshopper figurine, just seems odd, why not just a yes or no, but perhaps that was in the original book. And it doesn't make any sense to me why Raoul and Christine would wait to make their escape. Why not leave for England right away, why go back one more time to the haunted Opera House. I mean the show must go on, but that's just seems like a very stupid choice to make.

While this version is much better than the 1943 version we reviewed last year, it doesn't really hold up as well as I would have hoped. I can't imagine viewers of the 1920's weren't thinking the same things I was thinking while watching it.

However, the film should be seen if only for the reveal scene in the film, which I had to imagine at the time was very powerful. Sadly, we've all seen at least that part of the film by now, so that power has been reduced to curiosity.",1382832000,,1014,4.168367346938775

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because there wasn't any new information that I already heard and the tour of Universal's Stage 28 (The Phantom Stage) never happened -- which is the main reason why I bought the blasted DVD!!

2999221,4,B000X7SD6S,"This first movie version of The Phantom of the Opera was released in 1925, starring ""the man of a thousand faces"", Lon Chaney, as the Phantom. In an era when some actors still did their own makeup, Chaney was the master of grotesque transformations. The Phantom and the Hunchback of Notre Dame are his best known roles, both requiring extreme makeup for a shocking effect. The famous unmasking scene in Phantom is one of the highlights of early motion pictures, and reportedly caused shrieking and fainting among the audience.

In 1929, four years after its initial release, Phantom of the Opera was re-released in a newly edited version. Some major changes were made, including re-scripting so that the actress who portrayed ""Carlotta"" in the 1925 version became Carlotta's mother in the 1929 version. This required changing some of the on-screen written dialogue (remember, this was a silent film) so that the actress was now outraged on behalf of her daughter, whereas in 1925 she was outraged on behalf of herself. This and other changes required the shooting of some new scenes. Print damage is evident in many places throughout the 1929 film, with significant damage in two scenes shot at the same time in the boudoir with the boat-shaped bed. Many scenes are color tinted, some sepia, some red, some blue. One long scene, the Masked Ball, is in a primitive two-color rendition, showing reds and greens.

The Blu-ray edition from Image Entertainment offers three versions of the film, with two prints of differing lengths for the 1929 reissue, and an original print from 1925. No restoration has been done on this film, with the video quality depending entirely on the as-found condition of the 35mm prints. The high-definition transcription brings out the best in the original source materials.

Now bear with me, this gets a little complicated. In a great oddity, the only way the various versions of the film are differentiated on the disc, and the only way to access them, is to select the musical accompaniment from the disc menu. The film versions themselves are not listed on the menu. What I will call ""Version 1"" runs 78 minutes, and has the best video quality, taken from a print in good condition. It can be identified and accessed by clicking on the Alloy Orchestra soundtrack. An alternate organ score by Gaylord Carter is also offered with Version 1.

""Version 2"" runs 92 minutes, and can be identified on the disc menu by the Gabriel Thibaudeau orchestral score. The video is significantly lower in quality than Version 1, but still very watchable. The extra 14 minutes are devoted mostly to an extended ballet scene early in the film, and an elaboration on the ""Carlotta and Carlotta's Mother"" theme. Version 2 also has an excellent commentary by Jon Mirsalis, which I recommend for its insights into the history of the film and of Lon Chaney.

""Version 3"" is the original 1925 film, running 114 minutes, identified on the disc menu by the Frederick Hodges piano score. It features the poorest video quality, and the trimming in 1929 actually improved the story. According to information on the disc case, it was supposedly taken from a ""6 millimeter source"", which I am sure was intended to say a 16mm source. The standard-definition 1925 version is of interest only for comparison with the 1929 reissue.

This is the first Phantom movie, featuring one of the great actors of the silent era, on a Blu-ray disc with two high-definition versions of the re-edited film from 1929, plus the standard-definition 1925 original. It is a fine addition to a film collection, and well worth the minor hassle required to find the various versions on the disc.",1378598400,,3670,4.892282958199357

2999223,4,B000X7SD6S,"This movie is no doubt one of the all-time grand productions of the silent era--not to mention one of the more memorable, due in very large part to the talents of Lon Chaney Sr., who created one of the most memorable visages in all of filmdom as Erik the Phantom. But is ""The Phantom of the Opera"" a truly great movie? I would say parts of it are great, or at least memorable.

We all know about the ""unmasking scene"", which still packs a jolt 88 years after it was filmed. Erik's indignation as he points his accusing finger at the woman who violated his privacy, so to speak, turns to a mad sort of glee as he forces her to look upon his face (""feast your eyes--glut your soul on my accursed ugliness"") and seemingly just as quickly he turns away from her, knowing now that Christine has seen what's under the mask, his love will go on unrequited. That Chaney can win sympathy for such a hideous man is a testament to his talent.

On the flipside, there's the sequence with the chandelier, that seems to take forever building up to & when it finally does come crashing down, it's all over too quickly. As the picture moves towards its climax, you may start to wonder how indeed Erik managed to stay hidden for so many years. Before the movie is over, it seems like all of Paris is beating down his door trying to get at him. Did Erik start marking his trapdoors with X's?

Overall, I might be inclined to call this more of a great spectacle than film--a ""spectacle"" however that can still entertain and provide more than a few indelible memories.

Btw, the version of Phantom I have is the Image Entertainment DVD released several years ago. The color tinting was excellent & the print used was very good for a picture that's over 80 years old.

This was so much better than I was expecting ~ the length and breadth of scope is certainly there, but so are the facts, tidbits and fascinating footage which keep you glued to your seat.

The interviews are wonderful.  Technical quality is excellent. For a fan of Erik's this is a must.  This beautifully and lovingly traces the the evolution, history and adaption of a classic character and clearly illustrates how he's taken on a life of his own.

In the original story, Erik (the Phantom) is psychologically unstable, unloved, and horrific in appearance and often behavior. However, he also mirrors what is intrinsically human: the desire to be loved and accepted as we are. The interpretation of the classic story denied the Phantom this sense of humanity, which left me feeling very dissatisfied with the ending. On a brighter note, Lon Chaney's makeup is fantastic and believable!",1372032000,,610,5.11

Collecting the interviews as well as the posters, photos, clips, Aurora models and more clearly are a labor of love. I was particularly taken by the Carla Laemmie interview becuase she was in the 1925 silent film version of The Phantom and spoke with such clarity and passion. I'm very pleased that Mr. Hull has recorded her for history. Hugh Panaro, currently playing The Phamtom on Broadway, is another great interview as well as Michael Blake and Ron Chaney. Nothing has captured our hearts and minds like The Phantom whether it is on film or stage. This dvd has done them all justice.",1369958400,,707,4.7560975609756095
2999228,5,B000X7SD6S,"What a labor of love for one of the most memorable classic horror films this is!  ""The Phantom of the Opera: Unmasking the Masterpiece"" is over 100 minutes long and every second is pure gold.  I've watched it twice now--and enjoyed it even more the second time. It's obvious that a vast amount of painstaking research went into the documentary, but it never seems heavy or slow--it's always intriguing. Certainly a shining example of film history!  It's got it all!  I can't begin to guess how many photos and illustrations are used to accompany the interviews, but there must be hundreds.  The documentary is a feast for the eye from beginning to end.  There are photos, lobbies, posters--material I'd never before seen, and brilliantly presented. I found myself stopping and backing up the dvd time and again during my second viewing just so I could admire the beautiful artwork!

Impossible to say which of the interviews are ""best"". The interview with Carla Laemmle is a perfect example of living history.  Miss Laemmle was IN the 1925 silent version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA--she was interviewed when she was nearly 100 years old and was certainly one very bright and bubbly lady (indeed, I saw her at the Monsterpalooza convention this past April, and she's still bright and bubbly at 103!).  Her reminiscences about being on the Universal lot during the silent days are priceless, exciting and touching by turns.  Can't be many people left who can say they knew Lon Chaney Sr. and that they were close friends with Mary Philbin!  Miss Laemmle shares her personal experences with the viewer with such ease that it feels as though she's talking to you in your own living room.  What a treasure she is.

But then, ALL the interviews are great.  Chaney expert Michael Blake (has he ever been interviewed before?) was fascinating, as were Dan Roebuck and Steve Haberman--I learned so much I hadn't known before about the history of Phantom after Phantom--from Chaney to Claude Rains to Herbert Lom-- to James Cagney in MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES.  Wonderful anecdotes, solid history--the sort of combination that makes such scholarship a living, breathing thing.  Fun to see what Ron Chaney had to say about his great-grandpa's work, of course, and also to hear makeup genius Tom Savini and artist James Bama add from their considerable fund of info!  I'd have been pleased as it is just with the motion picture history--but Mr. Hull gives more than full measure to the viewer by adding material about the stage production of the Leroux story.  Hugh Panaro, longtime Phantom on Broadway, discusses his own experience at BEING the Phantom on stage and shares fascinating details about the makeup, the music, the stage magic.  Panaro's enthusiasm is contagious--no wonder the Phantom still lives on into the 21st Century on Broadway!

This is a documentary with both heart AND good content.  Now I want to re-watch the Chaney silent and track down the Rains and the Lom!  And maybe I can get to NYC to see Hugh Panaro!",1369872000,,3018,4.842105263157895

2999235,4,B000X7SD6S,"This is a great movie and an all-time classic. In this release, though, the music is a disaster. Someone just picked up three classical music pieces, put them together and looped the whole thing without even trying to match the scenes. I agree, creating a music score for the movie es quite expensive, but at least they could have chosen a wider variety of music and place it according to what happens in the different scenes. I happen to be a film composer, so I know what I'm talking about. I do this quite often to show directors what type of music could be used and it is not a difficult task.
Another thing quite disturbing is the copyright claim at the begining. This happens to be a movie in the public domain, due to Universal failing to renew the copyright in 1953. Companies shouldn't be allowed to take a work in the public domain, make copies of it and then claim a copyright over those copies. It should be illegal, if it isn't already illegal!
Despite all the above, I give it 4 stars just because the movie itself is a real treasure of the history of films and I wish to encourage other people to watch it.

2999236,4,B000X7SD6S,"OK, first off, it's the 1925 presentation of The Phantom of the Opera starring Lon Chaney. There is nothing wrong with the film in and of itself- it is still a masterpiece of early horror. If this is your cup of tea, then this will be a great addition to your movie collection. However, my review has to lose a star because I thought the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom was going to have at least one version that had been cleaned up & remastered to a pristine condition like what had been done to the Kino's 2010 Blu-Ray release of ""The Complete METROPOLIS"". Granted, I should have done a little more research - mea culpa. But alas, none of the three available versions on the disc have been cleaned in any way. They have all retained the scratches and the faded, discolored appearance of the film as it would appear if you played it in a projector today. If this doesn't bother you, then you should be just as happy with any other older, cheaper version of the film (lucky for me, I was able to get the Blu-Ray at a very discounted price so I do not feel as though I lost anything at all). If you're looking for a remastered version, as I was, then we're going to have to be a little more patient.",1356220800,,1198,4.258771929824562
2999237,5,B000X7SD6S,"The first version I watched is the 1929 reissue which was restored and presented at 20 frames per second and runs about 92 minutes.  This version features an orchestral score composed by Gabriel Thibaudeau and performed by I Musici de Montreal under Yuri Turovsky's conducting.  Claudine Cote handles various operatic performances.  This had always been my favorite ""Phantom"" among the many versions out there.  I liked the idea of the music following the staging of the Faust operas.  The synchronization wasn't perfect but seemed good enough.  Lon Chaney expert Jon Mirsalis adds an audio track to this version of the movie, but most of his commentary is less about the film and more about Chaney.  It is certainly informative for Chaney fans.  This Thibaudeau version certainly looks better than other attempts.  The only copy I had was a VHS tape which I can now thankfully toss.

Unfortunately this version isn't the best transfer included in this Image Entertainment package.  That distinction goes to the 78 minute transfer presented at 24 frames per second and includes 2 musical options.  The first is a new musical score by the Alloy Orchestra which did such good work on the silent documentary ""Man with the Movie Camera"" which was recently updated and released on DVD.  The second audio track is the generally well known Gaylord Carter's theater organ score.  I preferred the former but if you love that deep organ sound, Carter is for you.  The most exciting feature about this version is that the film itself is beautiful.  It is significantly better than the 92 minute version noted above.  While not perfect we see fewer flecks and burned edges.  Don't get me wrong.  If you are a fan of the Thibaudeau score, you'll get a longer movie and it certainly is watchable.  But this one looks better.

Finally, there is the original 1925 version which uses the 6 mm source copy and is presented in standard definition.  It runs 114 minutes and includes a piano score by Frederick Hodges.  It also differs from the other two in that it comes with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio compared to 1.2:1 for the other two.  It also differs in the fact that it is barely watchable compared to the restored revised 1929 versions.  Still at 1 hour and 54 minutes there are scenes here you won't see in other versions.

All 3 versions include some form of colorization and tinting.  Scenes change from sepia to black and white to green to red in varying shades.  Special features include an interview with Thibaudeau, some stills, film script and program reproduction.  I would have like to have seen some side-by-side comparisons and the ability to switch between all audio tracks would have been fun.

If you don't know the story here is a brief synopsis:  A disfigured man known as ""The Phantom"" lives below a Parisian opera house.  During performances, he even has his own box.  He has taken a keen interest in one of the performers, Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) who is the understudy to the primo soprano, Carlotta (Mary Fabian in '29 version).  The Phantom insists that Christine perform the lead.  She does and is a hit, but is replaced for the next performance by Carlotta.  This upsets the Phantom who then sabotages the next performance.  Under the Phantom's spell and promise of further stardom, Christine accompanies the Phantom to his underground lair.  Christine's boyfriend Raoul (Norman Kerry), finding Christine missing, searches her out along with help from a secret service agent (Gibson Gowland).  Nearly killed, the two rescuers are saved after Christine promises to stay with the Phantom.  Fat chance.  The Phantom ultimately decides he should just escape as hordes of pursuers are closing in.  He grabs Christine and the chase is on until he eventually meets his doom.  The sets and the production values are fabulous.  The acting is pretty much what you expect in these early films.  Lon Chaney is the exception.  His performance is haunting and horrifying.  Tame by modern standards, Chaney as the Phantom terrified audiences of the day when his face was fully exposed.",1355875200,,4083,4.902046783625731

The original The Phantom Of The Opera (1925) is one creepy classic that stars ""the man of a thousand faces"", Lon Chaney.  This movie is creepy from the first frame to the last.  The dark, creepy atmosphere is what makes this movie work.  The highly versatile Lon Chaney turns in another great performance, this time as the phantom.  There have been many remakes done over the years and it's quite a change when going from viewing this silent movie to viewing all the talkies over the years.  Some of the remakes have been good, such as the Hammer version from 1962, but I don't think any can quite compare to the atmosphere of the original.

If you're a Lon Chaney fan, then this is one of his more well known classics.  I highly recommend it.",1354147200,,920,4.493975903614458

2999241,5,B000X7SD6S,"I saw this one on public access TV in junior high, scratchy and jittery, and it inspired me to dress up as the Phantom that Halloween. I can still smell the hot dogs and marshmallows.

Anyhoo, this is Universal's best version, silent, rematsered and in color during the Masque Ball (the Red Death is awesome as well as the name I gave my car). This isn't really a longer version of the film but actually presented at the correct speed per frame.

While not following the novel (none the versions actually have) this is one of the most frightening. Lon Chaney Sr. was the father of Hollwood's FX artistry as well as Universal's first Monster as well as first beloved horror actor.

This is a 1929 re-issue of the first theatrical version (1925) of the Phantom starring Lon Chaney Sr. Here is a list of remakes:

1943: Claude Rains, in full color and more music than horror.

1962: Herbert Lom, a Hammer film with violence and blood.

1983: Maximillian Schell (sp?) and Jane Seymour (gorgeous) in a TV revision that changes names, locale and intent.

1989: Robert Englund and Jill Schoelin (sp?) (gorgeous, too), gory, sexual and even acts as a sequel of sorts.

1998: Julian Sands and Asia Argento (also gorgeous), rats, rape, murder and very dark.

2004: based on the lavish, superior stage play that always bring the Angel of the Night out in me.

There was a TV miniseries with Terry Polo and an animated movie, but I have not seen these two so I'll leave 'em alone.

The Phantom, Erik, represents every artists' hopes and aspirations in a world that does not appreciate them, and explores the ugly (sometimes on the outside, sometimes on the inside) thing that always accompanies great talent. One of my favorite monsters, one of my favorite novels, onw of my favorite plays and one of my favorite soundtracks.

I still have my Universal Monsters 3-inch action figure featured in my Halloween Town display.

2999245,5,B000X7SD6S,"This review is for the 1997 DVD, which Amazon is advertising as ""The Phantom of the Opera (1929 re-release)."" While the picture quality is not as crisp as the Milestone edition, Gabriel Thibaudeau is hands down the best soundtrack I've seen for this film.  The music perfectly counterpoints the action.  Case in point: For the chandelier sequence, Thibaudeau has soprano Gerda Findeisen sing a lilting aria from Gounod's Faust (1859), who's major key creates an exquisite tension against the mounting suspense.  As the chandelier breaks free, the joyful song turns into a terrifying shriek, which rendered this usually unemotional sequence into a truly gripping and dramatic event.

No other experience of the Phantom has come this close to the emotional engagement of Thibaudeau's score.  Thibaudeau uses an entire range of craftmanship, and is not afraid to use silence, and sudden polyphony to clarify cuts, or build incredible suspense.  While most ""silent"" scores feel heavy-handed, overly emotive, and are at the worse, mere filler to keep you from getting too bored, the essence of Charles Van Enger exquisite imagery is trully expressed through Thibaudeau's score.

In my opinion, the only Phantom worth showing to a first-time audience.",1334707200,,1245,5.321428571428571
2999246,4,B000X7SD6S,This new Blu-ray version of the 1929 PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is the best-looking yet. All previous DVDs pale in comparison. Arrived in great shape.,1331856000,,144,4.8
2999247,5,B000X7SD6S,"As a long-time ""Phantom"" fan (for almost 50 years and the Chaney is the best film version of the novel), I thought the 2-DVD Milestone set would be the last word. And in some ways it is. As some people don't know, Blu-Ray can only bring HD to films that that are in or close to pristine condition. Unfortunately, the original negatives of this great film have long been lost. The 1929 reissue had different cuts from the original but this Blu-Ray does make them more clear. It does nothing with the original 1925 print which is also slightly blurred as it is a copy from the period that also suffered much wear. If you have the 2-DVD Milestone set from 2003, keep it because not all of the extras are transferred but I do recommend adding this Blu-ray for the 1929 reissue.

For once, the newly-commissioned scores are overall quite good as is the Cater organ score. The Alloy Orchestra is the better of the two but it would have benefited from a speed of 20 frames per second. The Thibaudeau score is mated to a less-good print and uses a soprano whose parts could well have been omitted as they add nothing but this isn't a vocal review so I'll refrain. The only problem is that had the Alloy Orchestra musicians looked at the FAUST score, it would've been better. For instance, using the jewel song music for the finale made little sense especially when something else had to be improvised when the actual jewel song was needed. Frederick Hodges' piano score for the 1925 version is also quite good.

By the way, this version of the novel is far superior to the Webber film or any of the subsequent ""Phantom"" films, most of which use the title then make up their own story. For instance, the phantom's face wasn't burned with acid or fire. He was born that way which makes his character even more understandable. In fairness to the Webber, his musical is the only dramatization, aside from the 1925, to make that point. Just too bad the film of the musical wasn't better.

It's time Amazon did an edit job and remove any reviews that don't address this specific Blu-ray edition as some older transfers weren't very good and to include them in the review pot is unfair to buyers and this edition.

2999250,5,B000X7SD6S,"Of all the film, T.V., and musical adaptations of Gaston Leroux's novel, ""The Phantom of the Opera"", none is as faithful to the source as the 1925 silent screen masterpiece starring the great Lon Chaney.

 Chaney gave his most iconic portrayal as Erik, the ""phantom""; a character mix of stark terror, hateful vengeance, and touching pathos. The make-up Chaney devised for himself is still brilliantly horrific, and is justifiably regarded as one of the most famous visages in movie history. The film is aptly  melodramatic, the acting  grandiose and stylized as befitting the opera setting. This is often misunderstood by modern viewers, who don't appreciate the unique and complex technique of silent film acting - truly a lost art. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA contains some of the cinema's most famous moments: the climactic  unmasking scene (copied but never equalled), and the collapse of the Opera's chandelier.

 Image's Blu-ray is stunning, edging out everything that we've seen before. Offered here are three versions; two of the '29 re-release taken from 35mm nitrate sources and the original '25 release taken from the only extant 16mm print of lesser quality. The '29 version is presented at 24fps and 20fps, and is quite eye-opening for anyone familiar with PHANTOM. Although there's the expectant wear, the clarity and sharpness is beautiful, with nice, even grain resolution. There are four music scores and extras that include stills, the original trailer, full script, souvenir program, and an interview with Gabriel Thibaudeau, composer of one of the optional scores. His music is magnificent, unleashing all the emotion of this film in a way like never before.

2999252,4,B000X7SD6S,"Overall the blu ray release looks pretty good and maybe as good as it gets for Phantom. However, I found a few perplexing issues with this release. One is the menu, already discussed in another review, in which you choose the version you want to watch through the orchestral score. So you need the box as a key to inform you which score will give you the 1925, 1929 (20fps) or 1929 (24fps) versions. A strange way to set-up a menu indeed. The more disturbing aspect of the DVD is that during the transfer there appears to be hairs in the film gate, at least in the 1929 (20fps) version. (Haven't watched the other two versions yet).  It seems strange to me that they would go through the trouble to get the best possible 35mm nitrate print, produce a blu ray edition, make it seem like it is going to be the ultimate Phantom and then let the transfer be marred by hairs floating about the image. Watching the DVD gave me an urge to blow the hairs out of the film gate.",1320710400,,968,4.2896174863387975

Instead, there are options to play the film with various and sundry musical scores.  When you DO choose a score, it's pure Hell getting back to the main menu!  Try it yourself, it's quite a puzzle.  I would explain how I figured it out, but it would take too long to go into here.

Anyway, other than the goofy authoring, it's a great release.  Maybe they'll reissue this one day with choices for the various versions of the films presented on the main menu.

2999254,5,B000X7SD6S,"***Update. Feb. 4, 2012. I just received a replacement Blu-ray sent from Image and although the menu is easier to access-- for example the version listed as 20 fps Gabriel Thibaudeau score and the 1929 24 fps version with the Gaylord Carter score, etc. the menu is the only upgrade. The momentary ""freeze"" moments which is in the first release on the 20 fps version are, sadly, still there. From what I can tell, only the menus were made better, which is both good and bad. It is nice the menu is easier to access for people who buy this new version but sad that the 20 fps movie still has several moments where for a split second the image freezes. Why they left that the same I have no idea. Okay, back to my original review in early November:

I just finished watching one of three versions available on ""The Phantom of the Opera"" Blu-ray starring Lon Chaney and since then I have checked out the other two versions. First I watched the 20 fps (frames per second) version because I love Gabriel Thibaudeau's score. I was blown away by how sharp the picture looked. I definitely picked up on details I had not noticed before. When the Phantom is in the water, for instance, you can see just how wet the coat is when he climbs back out and details on his face as well. There is also no motion blur as there was on the Milestone release. The one quibble I do have is that there are a few instances in which the movie freezes for a second and then continues running. One place this happens is when Christine jumps up from the couch in the Phantom's cellar. There is a momentary freeze and then also when she wakes up in the morning. It wasn't in Image's DVD release but this appears to be a different print. I have read another writer's review about this problem and he made note of it too. He says the producer of the Blu-ray, David Shepard, is aware of a few of the issues and there apparently will be a second pressing of this Blu-ray with the issues corrected. That is good news. The Alloy Orchestra version, the 24 fps version, did not have the freeze moments. The image details makes this Blu-ray well worth owning. Also, you choose the three versions based on the score. I know that is odd but you choose the Thibaudeau listing on the menu for the 29 version, at 20 fps, and then you choose the Alloy Orchestra Score for the 24 fps 1929 version and you can choose the Gaylord Carter score instead if you wish as it pops up and gives you the choice. The Jon Mirsalis commentary is on the Thibaudeau version and is interesting. Finally, you can choose the 1925 Phantom version by choosing the Frederick Hodges score. Although this is a bit different way to choose, I did not find it complicated. The Bonus features include a Phantom Trailer and the Thibauddeau interview, which was interesting. Also included are reproduction program photos as well as the shooting script on screen. I understand Milestone will release a version next year which will include the Carla Laemle interview from their DVD release a few years ago and a few other items. In the meantime, I am fully happy I purchased this. The Phantom, believe me, has never looked better and again, there is no motion blur. This is a Sweet release. I highly recommend it if you love Chaney and/or the Phantom. One thing I should add is that you get the proper aspect ratio. If you have a widescreen TV it is displayed in a square fashion as the movie was originally presented. If you own the ""Wizard of Oz"" on Blu-ray, it is identical in the way it is presented. It is so cool to see the Phantom in HD! Purchase this one today. You will be glad you did.",1320105600,,3617,4.398507462686567
2999255,5,B000X7SD6S,"This Phantom of the Opera shows its age, to be sure, but it has held up surprisingly well. While co-stars Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry hardly set the screen on fire (as commentator Jon Mirsalis notes), an evocative and then-gargantuan production design, as well as Chaney's commanding performance more than make up for the lack of chemistry between the supposed romantic duo. What is so fascinating about this film is that Chaney is really not all that present and yet his presence looms over the entire film in a menacing way. For the first half hour or so, he's only seen sparingly, and then only in shadow or silhouette, making the iconic unmasking of him in the bowels beneath the Paris Opera all the more dramatic. Director Rupert Julian (aided by an uncredited Edward Sedwick and even Chaney himself for reshoots Laemmle ordered both for the 1925 and rejiggered 1929-30 versions) keeps things moving fairly briskly, though truth be told the original 1925 version can be a somewhat slow slog at times, despite its more coherent and cohesive storyline. The special effects are really quite convincing considering the age of the film, and Chaney's makeup certainly still retains its horrific nature and certainly is still easily one of the most disturbing transformations in the annals of film, silent or otherwise.

The Phantom of the Opera is presented on Blu-ray with an AVC codec. The 24fps 1929 version is offered in 1080p in a 1.2:1 aspect ratio. The 20fps 1929 version is presented in 1080i in a 1.2:1 aspect ratio. (I have emails and phone calls into various sources to find out if the interlaced presentation of this version is one of the technical issues with the first pressing of the BD which David Shepard has mentioned publicly). The 1925 version of the film is presented in 480p standard definition in an aspect ratio of 1.37:1. The press releases accompanying this release are a tad confusing. While there's no question that the 24fps 1929 version was sourced from a 35mm negative, some press releases make it seem like the 20fps version was sourced from either the same negative (which doesn't seem technically possible, frankly, considering the different frame rates) or another one, but there is no question that the 20fps version comes from a different, and decidedly inferior source element, than the 24fps version. The good news is that the 24fps 1929 version is going to be a minor (perhaps even a major) revelation to those who have grown up with inferior 16mm transfers of this film. The transfer is surprisingly damage free. The two strip Technicolor Bal Masque sequence looks great,with the reds popping magnificently. Several other sequences have been hand colored to recreate the original Handschiegl Color Process. The 24fps version offers superior clarity and sharpness, within reasonable expectations. The 20fps 1929 version is a rather major step downward in quality, at least in terms of damage. This version has considerably more wear and tear, with many more scratches, flecks and specks dotting the image with fair regularity. It still has some nicely sharp moments and those who prefer 20fps for their silents will most likely not be too disappointed. The 1925 version, in standard def and sourced from a 16mm print, is obviously the worst looking of the bunch. The image is often quite fuzzy and some of the inserts, as in the letters which are seen in close-up,are quite poor.

The cliff note version of the movie Erik the Phantom of the Opera kidnaps Christine Daa; the opera singer he is in love with. He takes her to his underground lair to be with him forever. Christine unmasks the Phantom and sees his horrible face. Raoul and Ledoux chase after the Phantom and rescues Christine. The Phantom is chase by a mob to the Seine where he is beaten and thrown in the river.

My main comments are about this DVD. This DVD version seems to be the 1930 International re-issue version. The 1930 version is a sound version with a musical score, but still shown in silent version with no one talking with title to explain the moving lips or events. Also there is the Technicolor scene that can be seen in the Bal Masqu segment. This information comes from [...].

This movie version of the book is the most closely accurate. There are a few scenes that are different. In the book the Phantom dies of a broken heart and in the movie he is beaten to death and drowned. In the novel Erik has many trades like: illusionist, magician, ventriloquist, and architect. In the movie version Erik is a self taught musician, an expert in the Black Arts, and an escapee from Devil's Island. Overall this is still a great movie to own and The Phantom of the Opera gets an AAAAA+++++.

2999258,4,B000X7SD6S,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film that is also historically important as an early hollywood horror extravaganza and as Lon Chaney's control over his own makeup.  Though I had seen pictures from this in innumerable monster mags, I had never seen this film.

In terms of drama, as long as you can understand the phantom's obsession with operatic art, it is very fun.  He has fallen for an artist and is promoting her career by his special kind of subterfuge and coercion.  At first, as a voice behind the wall, he seduces the singer by her interest in her career, enticing her away from her fiancee, an aristocratic army officer.  Then, he absconds with her, taking her into his mysterious lair, a medieval torture chamber beneath the Paris Opera, in which almost all of the film takes place.  Snatching off his sinister mask, she understands that he is a deformed monster -  not much nuance here - and wants to escape.  He vows revenge and kidnaps the girl, with her lover giving chase with a mysterious secret cop.  As he terrorizes the girl (the threat of rape is implied), her rescuers are imprisoned in one of his clever traps, though the ""parisian mob"" is in close pursuit, seeking to avenge itself on his many crimes against working men.  THe climax, which I don't want to reveal, is very fun and contains unique details, many of them humorous.

OK, as a silent film, this is not very subtle.  The Phantom is purely evil, if lonely and misunderstood in his obsession with art.  He had long ago escaped from an asylum for the criminally insane.  I was disappointed that there was not more to the character, but Chaney is absolutely fabulous as the deformed and evil genius, melodramatic with all the hyperbolic gestures of silent film.  It would be a later generation that does more nuanced versions of the phantom.

Recommended.  My daughter enjoyed this and is studying the various versions with me.",1300924800,,1911,4.7250755287009065
2999259,1,B000X7SD6S,"In ordering a bunch of different versions of Phantom of the Opera, I came across one labeled very differently from any of the ones I'd encountered before. This DVD is labeled with Nelson Eddy as the actor and 1913 as the date in which it was made. Assuming the seller was simply confused, I decided to get it anyway in the hopes it would be something completely new and different to help me with the project I was working on.

Before I even open the package, I can tell that this DVD's packaging ALONE is so bootleg that it's both hilarious and depressing. There wasn't enough love to even make it look halfway decent. The whole cover is obviously a low-quality printout on regular-grade paper, and it's not even cut evenly to fit the case correctly. The front cover is obviously badly manipulated in photoshop (or possibly even Microsoft paint, it's that bad), and the back cover tells me that this is copyright of ""A2ZCDS.com"", along with what I can only call a ballsy declaration of Federal copyright law forbidding unauthorized reproduction. The blurb on the back is full of unnecessary question marks and an outrageous font, unsuitable for a serious DVD.

Upon opening the case, I find no filler notes or even a scene listing. The case is empty with the exception of one lonely and depressingly bad looking DVD. The graphic is badly centered on the disk, everything is pink, and the entire print job is streaky. I'm dubious to put this disk in my DVD player because I doubt whether it will even work, so I try it in my computer. The title menu loads, and it's shivering and shaking like a chihuahua with pneumonia. It gives me the following options: Play Movie, Scenes, Other Titles, and Introduction.

I decide to check out the extra features first. Both ""Other Titles"" and ""Introduction"" are adds for this ""A2ZCDS"" company, boasting how they have lots of ""Timeless Classics"", and they begin naming off actors and titles from the early movie days. I try watching the movie to find, to my amusement, that is in fact the Lon Chaney 1925 silent film version, which in no way lives up to the original description telling me that this was Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster in 1913. The film quality is even more revolting than it usually is for this 1925 film, as it is pixelated and the screen continues to jiggle as if that aforementioned sick chihuahua were now having a seizure. I didn't bother to watch all the way through the film.

In summery: Bad, bad bootleg that shamelessly sells it's company like it's something awesome. It would be funny if I hadn't actually paid for it. Don't buy this.",1296604800,,2598,4.641304347826087

2999262,4,B000X7SD6S,"Is it possible that the new owners of the Paris Opera House were more easily given said ownership due to the belief of a phantom that lurks within the house's walls? Who sometimes sits alone in a balcony seat to watch the production at hand, only to disappear without a trace when the possibility of someone seeing its face arises? Who is writing threatening letters to the current female star to give up her part to another whom he has fallen in obsessive love for? Who causes a chandelier to drop onto the stage and crowd when the threats are ignored? Okay, it's changing from possible to probable, isn't it? It's also probable that you will find appreciation in one or more forms when watching this early Universal classic. The story has taken many directions through the years, but the production values for its time and the presence of Lon Chaney, Sr still give a good argument for being the best version. Not only is this the ""Man of a Thousand Faces""'s most familiar role, but it's also the most familiar physical interpretation of the Phantom after nearly a century of existence. Not my favorite silent horror movie, but it's certainly one that still warrants an encore viewing. Note: There are many different cuts and versions of this film (partially due to its public domain status), so I wanted to be more specific about the version I watched. It almost seems to be a hybrid of the '25 and '29 versions, completely silent (one of the '29 versions incorporated sound to almost half the movie), runs 106 minutes (the longest cut that I'm aware of) and the Bal Masque scene is in an early form of Technicolor, although other prints can have several scenes involving color and/or tints. Additionally, the accompanying music seems to be just an album of generic classical music that is repeated throughout the film and has no synchronicity with what is going on in the film, a fact that is more bothersome during the actual opera performance scenes. A version with a music score made specifically for the film is highly recommended. 6.5/10",1287964800,,2045,4.73109243697479

2999265,5,B000X7SD6S,"A MUST for all Phantom of the Opera lovers!  I'd read other reviews comparing the restoration quality of the 1929 version vs. the storyline quality of the 1925 original print and I totally agree that those are each version's strongest point.  However, the rarer 1925 print still looks much better than the inferior copies of the 1929 film that flooded the video market before Milestone thankfully came along with this great DVD set.

Along with extra features of rare footage, interviews, and photos, you can't help but wonder just how much greater this movie would've been under the overall competent direction it deserved instead of that from Rupert Julian. By the way, who was it that probably REALLY directed the unmasking scene? ;-)

Still, accompanied by beautifully eerie sets, shadowy lighting, and new orchestral scores, the timeless, shining jewel here is the incomparible genius Lon Chaney Sr. He IS the Phantom of the Opera; no other film ""Phantom"" has even come CLOSE to faithfully portraying the original character in Leroux's novel.

2999270,5,B000X7SD6S,"For starters, I have only seen the flm proper (1996 Photoplay restoration of the 1929 reissue), and will only limit my review to that.

The film is absolutely PERFECT!!! The greatest of Universal's horror films. The atmosphere, color, performances, and the fact that THIS film inspired ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" and all of the horor films made at the studio made in the 1930's and 40's make this an instant winner. Chaney is wonderful as the title role, and brings more depth to the character than most other performers. While Andrew Lloyd Webber kept the original ending and the emotional side to Erik, this film makes him less tragic, but more pitiful, as the death scene (combined with Carl Davis's wonderful 1996 re-score) makes anyone watching the film feel sorry for him. The way Chaney holds off the crowd with his gestures illustrates this as it perfectly shows that the Phantom knows how to manipulate people, and that he knows full well that he has sacrificed himself for Christine (I heard the 1925 version has a scene afterwards where Christine and Raoul take pity on him, which adds to the effect).

As for the restoration by Kenith Brownlow, many people point out the motion blur and the seemingly poor quality. This is not due to Milestone, as the restoration was made in 1996 (it's on the copyright and IMBd) using a wetplate process which has officially been out of style since the F.W. Murnau Stiftung decided to switch to digital for ""Metropolis"" in 2000. Many wetplate restorations have this problem, but this one happens to have the video transfer problem as well. The motion blur is partly caused by this, but other times, such as when Christine meets Erik and the unmasking, were MADE blurry to tone down the horror to make it palatable for 1925 moviegoers. While this may seem silly today, back then people fainted in this film and a typical horror film today would probably make people have heartattacks and have been banned and destroyed.

As for Carl Davis's music score, that is my favorite part of the entire film. I like to watch the movie JUST for this half the time. His work is wonderful, and even though I have seen another version with a surprisingly appropraite score (for a public domain video) with the actual arias from ""Faust"" dubbed in, this is still superior especially since Davis has been honored internationally for his work on silent film scores. Mary Fabian's sequence is wonderful, especially as the music builds up before the crash since it still follows the theme from the actual aria (as far as I can tell). Surprisingly this is actually one of Davis's more overlooked works with ""The General,"" ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and ""Intolerance"" being more highly praised, which says a lot about the quality for THOSE scores.

Overall, I think anyone interested in owning or even just viewing the silent film version of Gaston Leroux's novel, get the Milestone Collection simply for the Photoplay Production restoraton.

Augmentation: Finally owning this edition of the DVD, I find I was correct in asserting that the Milsetone DVD has nothing to do with the ""problems"" with the blurriness, it is inherit in the restoration. While I have seen a ""cleaner"" looking version, in terms of blurriness, and its from the Eastman negative, the quality of the fotage was still significantly less than this version, due to the decaying of the negative, which is not nearly as prevelent here.

On the DVD itself, GET IT!!!! Although the 1925 version is VERY low in quality, it is so shockingly different, I don't know whether to say it's better, or just different enough to be considered a separate film! I haven't seen all of it in a single sitting (I hate the music, so it really turns me off. If only the Photoplay 1925 restoration made in conjunction with their more well known 1929 was used since it has tinting and Carl Davis's score), but it certainly seems to be just as good, but looser in editing. The soundtrack using the 1929 VitaPhone discs sounds really poor, largely due to the quality of Direct to Disc recordings, but also since it is REALLY slowed down, so I think they should create its own edit instead of editing it into the SILENT restoration. It is nice to know that at least they tried, and Carlotta can finally be heard for the first time. The bonus features are nice, but I have not had time to look at them all, and some seem a little too mundane compared to other bonus features I've seen on other films.

The DVD is the ONLY way to watch this film, so I highly recomend it.",1258588800,,4532,4.721871049304678
2999271,5,B000X7SD6S,"I've been a longstanding fan of `The Phantom of the Opera'.  I've seen the stage play a record ten times, even being privileged enough to see it in Boston twice and once in New York.  I've seen nearly every filmed version (I say nearly because I'm not for certain I've seen every television movie made) and I even really liked the 2004 big screen adaptation despite the fact that the leading man was dreadful.

This is, by far, the best film version.

There is just something about the silent film era that suits a story like `The Phantom of the Opera'.  There is a Victorian anarchy that runs supreme in the air, giving this film a sense of elegant dread; a refined chaos.  The silent era cinema completely captures that, giving an authentic realism to this ghastly tale.

What I love so much about this film is that they really took the time to make Erik (the Phantom) more than just a monster.  I made the statement in my review of the revered 1933 film `King Kong' that they just made a superb monster film with no real emotional connection.  That is not the case with `The Phantom of the Opera'.  Yes, this is a superb monster film, but beyond that, it is a beautiful film about love, loss and the power of loneliness.

Lon Chaney IS the Phantom, with sincere terror and delicious sense of lovelorn absolution.  Chaney transcends the character and gives a richly memorable performance that just illuminates the screen.  Mary Philbin is stunning and very in tune with the sheer trancelike terror her character is experiencing.  I personally loved the light in the eyes of Emmy Rossum in 2004, and may prefer her performance (the ONLY thing she's done right in her career, thanks to that AMAZING voice) but there are not enough good things to say about Philbin.  I also really loved what Norman Kerry did with the stock character of Raoul.  He really gave him a life all his own.

With a beautiful fusion of horror and romance (a sick perverse romance, but romance nonetheless), `The Phantom of the Opera' is a marvelous film.  Restored in 1929 with an orchestral score that adds to the feelings of the opera house, this film is a must see for any fan of the story.  The restoration is not always perfect, but whether your watching scenes in a crisp sepia, murky aqua or splashed over with faded colors, the fact remains that you are watching one of the best films ever filmed; period.",1257811200,,2388,4.563380281690141
2999272,4,B000X7SD6S,"The art of fear is subtle.  It's not about in-your-face blood and guts and severed limbs.  No, the most rarified horror is when the atmosphere of the uncanny slithers on delicate scales and slowly wraps itself around you, squeezing, gently at first, until you can't scream -- or breathe.  You know the feeling: A sudden awareness that what you expected is not what looms on the horizon, blocking the last life-giving light.

Surrender to the velvety, shimmering shadows of this extraordinary masterpieces of terror and dread.  It seeks to embrace your jaded soul.

We all know Gaston Laroux's 1909 story by now  -- after all, it's been filmed three times and is one of the most successful musical adaptations of all time.  But for me, nothing comes close to the original 1925 production starring Lon Chaney in a role that made his grotesque, pathetic Erik an icon of world cinema and of modern culture.  The lovelorn phantom, dweller in the catacombed dungeons beneath Paris, haunts the opera house with murder, mayhem and his seductive, angelic voice that lures and instructs beautiful novice Christine (Mary Philbin) to stardom.  But alas, Christine loves another and plans to elope with him after her next performance. Erik finds out, lures her into his secret lair, removes his mask and reveals his disfigured face to her horror, triggering the wrath of her true love and that of a rabid Parisian mob.

Not long before he died, I spent an afternoon with Allan Dwan, the aged director -- he was a film pioneer who made well over 400 films - recalled how he discovered Lon Chaney.  Dwan said that on the set of one of the silent films he was directing, every day at quitting time he noticed an extra leaving the lot that had an odd look, or limp or some other attention getting gimmick.  Dwan spoke to him and realized it was all the same man, Lon Chaney, in various self-applied disguises.  On the spot, Dwan gave him expanded bit parts and extra screen time until he had larger and larger roles and finally a lead.  Chaney was always grateful for the opportunity lived up to and beyond expectations.  Chaney was a disciplined performer and thought nothing of applying prosthetic appliances that were painful to wear for any length of time.

The new Blu-ray disc of PHANTOM from Image Entertainment includes three versions of the film.  Two 1929 Reissues, one at 24 frames Per Second, a 1.2:1 Aspect Ration with a running time of 78 minutes and a brand new musical score by the Alloy Orchestra plus Gaylord Carter's theater pipe organs score.  The alternate 1929 Reissue at 20 Frames Per Second runs about 92 minutes with a score by Gabriel Thibaudeau featuring soprano Claudine Cote.  There's also fascinating minutia-filled commentary from Dr. John Mirsalis.  Both 1929 versions are in a surprisingly nice hi-def transfer.  There's also the original 1925 version from a 6 Millimeter Source Copy (presented in Standard Definition) with color tints that runs almost two hours and is displayed in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio with an atmospheric piano score by Frederick Hodges.

""Feast your eyes, glut your soul on my accursed ugliness,"" says Erik the Phantom of the Opera as he unmasks his true face.

Chaney's indelible portrait transcended cinema and entered modern culture as an emblem of humanity's damaged soul.  This version is as good as I've seen so far and is one for the digital library.",1257465600,,3394,4.84055459272097

I still can't believe Milestone/Image allowed this to get out the door. The 1929 print is made from the best available 35mm material BUT so much computer noise reduction was used that fast movements appear blurred and jerky. Yes Virginia, there IS such a thing as over-doing the electronic ""cleanup"". It almost makes me motion sick at times to watch it. And that is sad beyond belief. This is easily the best restoration available of the 1929/1930 by a long shot. But what good is that if you almost need Dramamine to watch it?

Another ""almost win"" is the 1925 edition on the second disc. It is only available on 16mm reduction prints sold for home viewing so the picture quality is not even close to the 1929 cut. BUT you get more story detail and more effective film editing (especially in the unmasking scene) than the later version. It does tend to drag in spots though. I can understand Milestone not wanting to pour massive amounts of cash into restoring this 1925 cut, but it would have been so worth it since there are already dozens of versions of the 1929 cut available.

It keeps the essence of Erik alive while playing out the story as close to the original as they come; the ending is different (of coarse) and the Persian is replaced with a policeman who is following Erik.  But other than that, it captures every essence and feel of the book you could hope for.

2999279,5,B000X7SD6S,"Some years ago the Brabants Orkest presented with Carl Davis the Pantom of the Opera. Carl Davis conducted the orchestra synchrone with the movie. It is a very special happening to see a movie this way. So when I saw it was available on DVD the dissision was made easily.

Not only the 1929 version with the score of Carl Davis is available. There is also a reconstruction of the soundtrack of the 1929 speaking version of the movie. Personally I like the silent version with the score from Carl Davis better. And there is the 1925 New York version. Finally there are interviews with people who worked at this movie. So this is a good documentation of this famous movie.

All the strong points of silent cinema are available:
- there is a score specially made for this movie,
- scenes are tinted to indicate place or mood (common practice at that time),
- filmspeed is correct so that you don't have the comedy capers effect,
- there are scenes with the early Techicolor two color system (I think this is the oldest commercially available movie with Technicolor),
- there are hand colored scenes, so you have a red cloack in an otherwise blue tinted frame.

2999280,5,B000X7SD6S,"Carl Laemmle's screen version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (based on the penny-dreadful by Gaston Leroux), is still a fascinating and riveting screen entertainment, despite being re-made several times (including 2 updates from Universal), not to mention Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage musical.

Lon Chaney gives the performance of his career as Erik, the tortured Phantom who roams the sewers and labyrinths of the Paris Opera House. His attentions are piqued by the beautiful young singer Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) though she is already being courted by Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny (Norman Kerry). As passions rise, the young lovers are terrorised by the demonic Phantom as he vows to make Christine his bride...

Lon Chaney turns in a polished performance as Erik (riding high on the success of his legendary turn as Quasimodo in Universal's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME). Mary Philbin's ethereal beauty serves her well as Christine, and Norman Kerry does all he can to overcome the one-dimensional character of Raoul.

The set built for the Paris Opera House was the biggest and most elaborate free-standing set ever assembled for a picture at the time (and still exists, carefully preserved on the Universal backlot). The lavish 'Bal Masque' sequence was shot in the relatively new 2-strip Technicolor process.

The original silent version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA premiered in 1925, but when the advent of sound occurred in 1929, Laemmle released a new print of PHANTOM with the voices dubbed in (sans Lon Chaney) and new ballet and opera sequences inserted. The film was re-edited by Walter Anthony.  The version that most people would have seen is actually a composite of the 1925 and 1929 versions.",1241913600,,1717,5.139784946236559

Two versions are offered of the classic including a restored,practically pristine,tinted edition of the 1929 reissue version(the most widely available version)which features an excellent new Musical score and an optional audio track with synchronized sound.
The second is the VERY rare,original 1925 version offered in a rough,but viewable version in Black and White.
This one is a huge treat as it offers alternate footage and extended scenes not available in the reissue.

The extras also include good commentary by Scott Macqueen on the film(he also did commentary on the 1943 remake) and script and film comparsions,as well as the original theatrical trailer!

The film itself is somewhat creaky,but is still full of gothic wonder,featuring one of the all time great Horror film performances in the form of the legendary Lon Chaney as the definitive Phantom.
Several unforgettable scenes include the classic unmasking scene,the chandelier scene and the great,technicolor Masque Ball with Chaney arriving as the Red Death.
Chaney's defiant final end as the Phantom is one,truly great moment of screen villiany.

2999283,5,B000X7SD6S,"I think many Phantom of the Opera fans (myself included) were inspired by the magnificent Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. After seeing the musical, I became obsessed with seeing the Lon Chaney silent film version from 1925.

Over the years, along with many other silent classics,this film has fallen into the public domain, meaning that its copyright has expired. Because of this, many video companies have been able to cheaply re-release the film on VHS and DVD. The problem with these versions is that they tend to have poor picture quality and backround music tacked-on that does not match the film at all.

At last, someone got it right. This two-disc set, released by Milestone, includes both versions of the classic with Lon Chaney in the titular role. Not only does it have the 1929 restored re-release that most people are familiar with, but also the rare 1925 original version with additional scenes that were edited out later. Also, Milestone had a musical score composed especially for the film that adds a new level of excitement to it. This is the proper way to release a silent film and I'm glad some smart movie studios have finally caught on to it. Also, included are a variety of interesting bonus features that accompany the film well.

My only complaint is that the 1925 film, while I can't deny that I am happy they included it, was not restored in the same way that the 1929 version was. Given the fact that the original film is over eighty years old and that the the version on the DVD is based on the only 16 millimeter print available, this is understandable. I feel like a bratty kid for complaining, but don't worry, it is hardly unwatchable because of this.

Overall, this film is still considered to be one of the best adaptations of Gaston Leroux's novel, it is arguably the best performance of Lon Chaney's career. The Milestone edition is probably the best version of the film out there, so I highly recommend it for any Phantom fan.",1234569600,,1961,4.691860465116279
2999284,4,B000X7SD6S,"I find the one problem with this dvd is the color tinting - I understand that it may have been done simply to provide some definition when some of the scenes had too much black in them. It's to be expected in a silent film, but I got spoiled on KINO's new updates on silent films that are always top notch and of excellent quality. Still, that is not to say that this film is lacking. If you like silent films, then you must have this film in your collection. Lon Chaney gives a performance never to be forgotten, and this film hits all the right notes for what you would expect in a silent film. The suspense builds, the score is beautiful, and what I love about the film is it sticks, for the most part, to the original storyline of the book - with the inclusion of Faust and all. The score even goes so far as to include the arias from Faust that were mentioned in the book, which only adds to the acting of this movie. Unfortunately, the female lead (who I have seen in many other movies, where she has done incredibly well) seems to flounder a bit in this role. But if you were to see her in ""The Man Who Laughs"", you would not believe it was the same person.

In short, despite minor flaws, this is a must-see for silent movie buffs and general film buffs alike.",1231718400,,1268,4.1755102040816325

The combination of music, shadows and color tinting of a black & white film work to render any dialogue an impediment to this film.

Lon Chaney's hideous face and his body language are more than enough to keep any viewer on the edge of their seat.  Simply stated, the film is worth watching again and again so as to better understand all the theatrics apart from dialogue that make a film a classic.  Hitchcock realized this as many of his films went minutes without a spoken word.

2999286,4,B000X7SD6S,"I bought this DVD at a Dollar Store on a rack full of Digiview el-cheapo DVDs.  The thought here was that for a single dollar, I couldn't lose.  I don't think I did.

Since this film from 1925 has not been restored, according to what I've read online, anyway, and is available only on a 16mm print at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, you get what you get.  It doesn't look pristine or even of fine quality.  It's definitely watchable, however, and you have to accept that up to now, that's all we can get.  Also, the only thing that comes in this version is the DVD.  NO ads, liner notes, pictures; zippo!  What do you expect for a buck?

A few mentions:
(1) The contrast varies during the film, but it's okay to watch, I guess. Sorry that it's not perfect.
(2) The ""soundtrack"" is not the original-style organ music that would have been heard in a real theater, but rather a repeated classical music track.  After a while, you will get tired of the repetition, although the music itself is fine.  More music segments would have slowed the repetition.
(3) The total time from the opening to the conclusion of the final credits is 1:46:18. Ignore the ""60 minutes"" mentioned on the DVD case.  That is completely wrong!
(4) The Ball scene is in the two-strip Technicolor, while the rest of the film is completely black and white.
(5) When Christine and Rauol are on the Opera house roof, the Phantom is still in black and white.
(6) After the opening titling and cast list, the film begins with the man with the lantern.

I'm just mentioning these items because of some Amazon comments I have read that mention some of these things, or just ignore them. As far as I can tell, this DVD version is the 1925 original.  Besides Lon Chaney, the cast includes Mary Philbin as Christine, and Norman Kerry as Rauol.

It's really hard to get accurate reviews of The Phantom of the Opera on Amazon because most of the comments on the various DVD versions are mostly repeated from the two-DVD set that features the 1925 original AND the 1929 re-worked  re-release.  Amazon needs to keep all of those comments confined to that particular release.  Each release should feature its own unique comments from buyers.  As you look around on Amazon, watch out for this problem.  At least Amazon mentions before each reviewer if that review is pertaining to another DVD version.

I really don't know if there are better looking versions of the 1925 film, since a real restoration apparently hasn't been done yet, and here it is 2008.  Why isn't some outfit doing a restoration?  This is a Hollywood icon from the silent era.  Even Universal hasn't restored this film.  Go figure out these people!

I hope this is a helpful review of a very cheap DVD, which turned out better than I thought it would.",1227398400,,2782,4.558467741935484

In The Phantom of the opera, Lon Chaney donned the mask of the tortured soul Erik, The Phantom. Joining Chaney in the cast was the beautiful young actress Mary Philbin as Christine Daae and Norman Kerry as the handsome Vicomte Raoul de Chagny.
The film was directed by the merely adequate Rupert Julian, who fashioned himself to be a master filmmaker but his unreasoning and demanding nature caused much toil during the making of the film. The Phantom of the Opera was rife with production troubles and conflict between cast and crew. However the end result was nothing short of a masterpiece, despite what critics of the time thought.
The reason for the film becoming an enduring classic was mainly Lon Chaney's performance and his remarkable makeup. Using little more than he could carry in an old tackle box, Chaney conjured a frightening persona. He skillfully created his most famous makeup with a combination of cotton and colodian, false teeth, and chemicals with which he dilated his pupils. Chaney also underwent the discomfort of having wires, which ran along the sides of his nose and were concealed by makeup, pull up his nose revealing his nostrils and giving him the appearance of having a skeletal face. His appearance and his performance would become iconic with filmgoers during the last years of the silent era, and still provides inspiration to many in the film industry today.
When the film was being marketed, Chaney ensured that the public would see no images of him in full makeup. This publicity stunt was extremely effective and when the film was released, audiences flocked to theatres wondering what the enigmatic Chaney would look like in his latest role. But nothing could prepare filmgoers for the shock of The Phantom's unmasking scene, which evoked cries of terror from audience members, who had never seen anything like it before.
The film was adapted from the novel by two screenwriters, Elliot Clawson and Raymond Schrock. The screenplay is just as convoluted as the novel was. This doesn't affect the film's status as a classic or depreciate the overall value of entertainment. In fact, the pulpy story is delightful, even if a bit tame when compared to the standards set by today's horror films.

The story follows Christine Daae, a beautiful young singer at the Grand Paris Opera House, who becomes the obsession of Erik, the masked madman who lives deep in the catacombs beneath the opera house. Erik, who is best known by the title of The Phantom of the Opera or Opera Ghost for short, uses his genius to orchestrate the lives of all who reside in the opera house. When the opera house is sold to two new owners, The Phantom finds that his rules are being broken and he lashes out at those that dare to defy him. But no one can imagine the full wrath and fury of The Phantom, that is, until the appearance of the dashing young Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who begins courting Christine. When The Phantom lures Christine to his cavernous lair, she unmasks him revealing a hideously deformed face. The Phantom becomes distraught, knowing that Christine could never grow to love a creature so monstrous in appearance as himself, and he lets her go. Before releasing her, The Phantom tells Christine that she now belongs to him and he warns her to never again see Raoul. During the celebratory Bal Masque de l'Opera, The Phantom intrudes dressed as The Red Death and he finds Christine and Raoul planning to run away together. The Phantom waits patiently before making his final move. Once again he abducts Christine, claiming that she is his possession. Raoul, panic-stricken, is shown the secret location of The Phantom's lair, but can he outwit... The Phantom of the Opera?

This 2-disc Ultimate Edition DVD is spectacular.
The first disc includes the meticulously restored 1929 version of the film, along with two soundtracks and an audio commentary with film historian Scott MacQueen. The two soundtracks include the Carl Davis orchestral score and the soundtrack of the dubbed 1930 version with dialogue sequences. Also featured on the first disc are an extensive collection of image galleries, audio-only selections of dialogue that is not included in the restored version, and two theatrical trailers.
The second disc includes the 1925 theatrical release of the film, along with a score by Jon Mirsalis, an interview with Carla Laemmle, an extract from the film Midstream, which features a portion of the opera Faust, and an audio-only interview with cinematographer Charles Van Enger.
Though the 1929 version of The Phantom of the opera has been gorgeously restored and color tinted, the 1925 version has not been restored and is scratchy, out of focus, and completely in black and white.
Image Entertainment's Ultimate Edition of The Phantom of the Opera is without doubt the best available DVD edition, however it does not quite live up to the promise of being the Ultimate Edition. Still, it's a must-have for Lon Chaney fans and connoisseurs of classic horror films.

You get terrible visual quality, no score (or worse, a dreadful score composed of random copyright-free music), and missing or disordered footage.

Image's Ultimate Edition of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" on the other hand, contains two versions of the film (the original and the more commonly seen 1929 re-release), appropriate soundtrack options, commentaries, high visual quality (on the restored 1929 version), and beautiful restoration of the famous color sequences.

The DVD offers still image recreations of the two premiere versions of the film through which a dedicated fan can track the creative development of the picture.
My chief misgiving is that no one has attempted to restore the original 1925 version of the film. The DVD uses a version from the only surviving 16mm print, but the quality of that print is appallingly poor. It is full of countless scratches and other blemishes.

This has long been one of my favorite films, but felt as if I had only seen it for the first time after watching the 1929 edition included in this set. The print is beautiful, and the commentary by Scott MacQueen is insightful. The technicolor has been added to the ""Bal Masque"" scene, and there is a gorgeous scene of a red-cloaked Erik poised against an anotherwise blue-tinted background. Plus there are loads of stills, promotional materials, alternate music and soundtracks, as well as the 1925 cut of the film.

2999301,4,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney was the first of the long line of Phantoms and the one against whom all his successors had to be measured...

The story, despite all its alternatives, is the familiar one of the musician avoiding the world because of his disfigurement and retreating to a hideout beneath the Opera House, from where he emerges to terrorize singers and audience alike...

He kidnaps a young girl singer - perhaps to teach her to become a great star; certainly because, in his grotesque and pathetic way, he loves her - and carries her off to a boudoir he has prepared far underground...

There was melodrama in plenty: in the first version, for example, two would-be rescuers found themselves trapped in an uncomfortable mirrored room the Phantom had prepared, where they first got a heat treatment and then were flooded...

But, beyond all the heightened effects, it was the pathos of the Phantom underscoring his lonely menace which gave the character a dimension, and the isolation of the captor and his captive, imprisoned to a literal underworld, which gave the suspense of the whole film its power...",1168387200,,1099,4.89247311827957

2999303,5,B000X7SD6S,"This truly is the ultimate edition of Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera.  The film has quite an involved history that included cuts of the film in search of a final release version.  The 1929 re-release of Phantom is on disc one and it is a magnificent print of the utmost clarity assembled from an original 35mm print with a restored two-strip Technicolor sequence and hand tinting of the Apollo's Lyre scene atop the Paris Opera.  The score by Carl Davis is perfect for the film, capturing the drama of the action.

On disc two is the 1925 release of Phantom that is about 10 minutes longer than the 1929 re-issue.  The missing footage extends existing scenes and provides a little more continuity with the action going on.  There also was a different angle shot of Lon Chaney in the unmasking scene.  There is a better flow to the action in the 1925 version but the print is very grainy and is slightly damaged at points.  The score by Jon Mirsalis is adequate at best and is un-dramatic when the chandelier falls and in the unmasking scene.  Despite this, it is fascinating to compare the 1925 to the 1929 versions.

The bonus features are also highly interesting.  There is a short interview with Carla Laemmle, who was the chief ballerina.  There are also two collections of stills from the San Francisco and Los Angeles initial screenings that represent the original cuts of Phantom that followed the novel by Gaston Leroux more closely, providing the background to the relationship of Christine and Raoul and the rivalry Raoul has with his brother over Christine.  Also in this early version is the ending from the book where Christine kisses Eric, he allows Raoul and Christine to go and dies playing the organ rather than being chased by a mob.  The character of the Persian (who later becomes police inspector Ledoux) is played as the friend of Eric that he is in the novel.  Apparently, early audiences did not want the Phantom to be a sympathetic character so he was transformed into an escaped lunatic.

This collection is a must for anyone who is interested in silent films and in the Phantom of the Opera in particular.",1166054400,,2135,4.683646112600536

The Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite books of all time and I have been disapointed many times by the many attempts film makers have made at bringing this story to the screen. They need to just tell the story the way it was written, because it is flawless the way it is. It does not need Hollywood changing it, trying to make the story more interesting. This film is the closest thing to the real story and Lon Chaney prortrays the Phantom as he really is, A disfigured monster and madman. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the stage version by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the new movie version of it, but nothing compares to the original story. The fact that this is a silent film only adds to the beauty of it. I guess you have to have a thing for movies like this to appreciate it, but I guess I'm one of those people.

2999307,4,B000X7SD6S,"Despite a history of production troubles and extensive re-editing, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925) has survived as a landmark of the silent era  thanks largely to Lon Chaney's classic performance in the title role. It's a stylish melodrama with serial-style thrills and some genuinely horrific moments.  The DVD ""ultimate edition"" features plenty of extras and a memorable Carl Davis score. Remakes come and go, but the original reigns supreme.",1129852800,,446,5.357142857142857
2999308,4,B000X7SD6S,"While I have absolute praise for what is the most comprehensive edition of the original edition of the silent Lon Chaney, Sr. classic, what prevents this edition from being virtually flawless is the actual presentation of the 1929/1930 foreign reissue version, from the finest known surviving print courtesy of The George Eastman House.

Transferring what is essentially a hybrid of silent (approx 18 frames per second) and sound (24 fps) footage from this release at its closest possible silent presentation (except for the sound version chandelier sequence footage featuring Mary Fabian as Carlotta), mastering in Europe's PAL (25 fps) format, and converting it yet again to NTSC (30 fps) for North American Region 1 release makes this presentation very choppy looking.

Film preservationist Scott MacQueen did a fine digital cleanup to remove as much dirt and scratches from the video source provided by Photoplay productions, and the film has a pristine look, but the jerky appearance of the all the multiple frame-rate conversion cannot be saved. Having to match the Vitaphone soundtrack from the lost 24fps sound reissue to this sluggish presentation also affects the pacing. The supplemental sound reissue trailer (with soundtrack intact at proper sound projection speed) is a better indication of what the film should have sounded like. The Art Deco trailer also gives a glimpse of a cut scene as Chaney is first revealed by being brought up by the mechanism moving the mirror of Christine Daae's dressing room, instead of the more suspenseful hand on the shoulder.

In all fairness (and this may upset silent film purists), I believe a 24fps presentation would have been the best way to go.

That aside, the bonus materials make this a fabulous addition for Phantom fans, thanks to an informative audio essay by Mr. MacQueen, who documents the troubled production, the incompetence of 'director' Rupert Julian, and the sole savior of the film, actor/make-up master (and self-director) Lon Chaney.  His body language is what makes the film most powerful, and his use of several variations of masks and facial makeup combined with critical lighting and photography under his direction make Chaney's Phantom one of the most iconic villians/monsters in movie history, while making him (like his other monstrous creations like ""Hunchback""'s Quasimodo) a creature worthy of pity.

Another rarely-seen bonus is the inclusion of a 16mm print of the ""show-at-home"" 1925 general release version, first seen by laserdisc fanatics on Image Entertainment's 1990 double feature laserdisc.  By the time this version of the film had been issued in 1925, it was the third such release for 'Phantom', and the hodgepodge of title cards vary from rewrites and reshoots that occured (the first two premieres were disasters). The 16mm 1925 version features several different (albeit better) takes of shots and additional sequences dropped from the later sound reissue and give a more cohesive story than the version commonly seen today, but its visual quality understandably leaves much to be desired.

Missing pieces of the Phantom's history are filled out in recreations of the first two premiere versions thanks to surviving shooting scripts and still photos.

The 'Ultimate' version of Chaney's Phantom has yet to be satisactorily released, but his package will do very nicely, thank you very much...",1129334400,,3391,5.276437847866419
2999309,5,B000X7SD6S,"The image of Lon Chaney as The Phantom of the Opera is one of those classic screen images, right up there with Karloffs Monster & Lugosis' Dracula, instantly recognisable. I purchased this Milestone 2 DVD release on a whim & have thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite Rupert Julians flawed direction, nothing can diminish the impact of Chaney's performance. As with all great monsters, the sympathy & understanding are with him. According to the excellent commentary by Scott MacQueen, it was rumored that Chaney directed his own scenes, & the performance of Mary Philbin does become remarkably 3 dimensional in their scenes together.

The new score by Carl Davis is a work of pure genius, brilliantly integrating excerpts from Gounods Faust in a tone poem of extreme beauty. The colour restoration is breathtaking, particularly the Lyre of Orpheus scenes. Nothing to complain about....treats all 'round.",1128038400,,897,5.2727272727272725
2999310,5,B000X7SD6S,"There must be two dozen productions of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.  My two favorites are the 1925/1929 Lon Chaney, Sr. silent thriller and the enthralling Joel Schumacher/Andrew Lloyd Webber 2004 opera.  There are a lot of versions of the Chaney masterpiece to buy, including $5 drugstore copies with no music score.  Kino has an outstanding copy, mastered from a 35mm European film archive print with a beautiful orchestra score.  It sells for a reasonable $25. You can't go wrong with it.

But if you want the ultimate copy, and not have to buy a second copy of the film, go with the Milestone Collection double disk for only $25.  You get a Lon Chaney double bill with Milestone-Disk 2 has the unrestored 1925 original.  It runs 107 minutes with a Jon Mirsalis orchestra score.  Disk 1 is the restored 1929 version, with talking sequences that are apparently lost.  But some of the soundtrack exists as a bonus-with Christine and Raoul, not the Phantom.  The 1929 film runs a tighter 95 minutes and offers two very different music scores:  Carl Davis and a stereo orchestra score; and the original 1930 early talkie music score plus audio commentary by film scholar Scott MacQueen.  Other bonuses include an audio chat with cinematographer Charles Van Enger and remembrances by Carla Laemmle.  In any event, if you want to buy the Lon Chaney PHANTOM, by all means get the Milestone Collection double disk.

How does Chaney stack up against Andrew Lloyd Webber?  I love both a lot.  Chaney is a criminally insane escapee from Devil's Island; Lloyd Webber's Phantom is a tragic hero who actually doesn't look that bad without his partial face mask.  Chaney is chilling as he drives his small boat with Christine through the Paris sewers.  By contrast, Lloyd Webber's Phantom is almost a lounge singer when he does the grandly romantic""Music of the Night"" and ""All I Ask of You"".  And the chandelier falls in different places.  (PLOT SPOILER ALERT!)  It falls 1/3 of the way through Chaney's movie and at the Act one finale in the stage production because it takes twenty minutes to pull it back up to the ceiling.  But it falls in a third spot in the movie, and maybe the best spot dramatically.  And the film has a haunting flash-forward that becomes clear and poignant in the last scene.  The Chaney film has a mob chase the Phantom into the Seine to drown.  The 1925 version has a 20 second lovers' embrace epilogue.

Have a great Halloween with the Milestone Collection version of Lon Chaney's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, but you won't go wrong if you pick the Kino version with just the restored 1929 version and an orchestra score and color tints.  Save the swooningly romantic and elegant Lloyd Webber film for Valentine's Day!",1127520000,,2727,4.746808510638298
2999311,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney's silent version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the hallmarks of cinema (say what you will about the movie itself) and probably the strongest reason why the original book managed to survive the ""death"" of Leroux's other works.

The five-star rating above is for the DVD set.  The movie itself (either version that's included here) would rank slightly less due to the less than stellar directing and performances.  Chaney's performance and appearance, however, are still fantastic (and listening to the commentary just increases my admiration for the man), and the set design is absolutely wonderful.

This DVD set is the perfect compilation of the silent ""Phantom""--or at least the best that can be made with the existing materials.  It contains both the 1925 original, general-release version (by far the most fleshed out and faithful), and the 1929 ""silent version"" re-issue (the better presented of the two, including the primitive Technicolor moments that had been originally intended for the film).  They each come with their own soundtracks.  The 1925 version only has one--a servicable enough score by Jon Mirsalis that only lacks the necessary dramatic punch in a few areas (like the un-masking scene).  The 1929 comes with two--a full orchestral score by Carl Davis, and as much of the 1929's ""sound version's"" soundtrack as can be edited to fit the film (the music for which is nice enough, but I could do without the histrionic voices myself).

The extras include an excellent and thoroughly informative commentary by Scott MacQueen, the additional soundtracks from the 1929 ""sound version,"" theatrical trailers, a taped interview with Carla Laemmle, an old audio interview with cinematographer Charles Van Enger, an ""opera extract"" of a sequence from Faust (an interesting diversion, at least), and a large photo gallery that includes stills from the two preview versions of the movie (both containing cut scenes and characters).

This DVD set proves itself to be one of the finest and most complete that can be created for a movie of the silent era.  A must for film buffs, and Phantom ""phans"" who like to have a bit of the Chaney version for their viewing pleasure.",1124668800,,2199,5.06371191135734

2999314,5,B000X7SD6S,"I do not mean to criticize the  most current incarnation to the screen of the Phantom of the Opera but it is my opinion that the original was far superior.

The silent is truly engrossing and atmospheric and does a phenomenal job inspiring both pity and dread.
Unlike today's movies most of the silent films left much to the imagination and the fact that this version was a silent picture allows the viewer the space to dream the way a good piece of fiction does.

The sets are remarkable. The volence seems  mcuh more horrific  than without the  spurting of blood and dismemberment  we find in day's films and the sewers of Paris seem so dankwe can almost feel them.

The center piece of course is Lon Chaney, the man with a thousand faces. Before the days of  fancy computerized special effects  Lon Chaney perfected movie make up and yet though the gruesome  make up he creates for this role his expressive face conveys emotions that many of today's script writers have trouble conveying in words.

We are repulsed by the Phantom and still we feel his isolation and his love for a woman.

When he is pursued as a fiend we find it heartbreaking.

The film is more than just an artifact of history. Even now it is an effective poetic portrayal not only of a disfigured man but of the human condition.

Every love who loves film should enjoy this picture.

Highly recommended.

2999315,5,B000X7SD6S,"After watching the new Phantom of the Opera, and then going back to watching this silent film version for the first time, it made me feel somewhat shocked but relieved that i liked the silent version one much better. Sure, it's a bit too old to be 100% bearable to watch, not to mention that the acting (and the times cringing and horrible music!) is a bit muddled, but i think the best reason to watch the film in general is to see the wonderful and haunting scene when the phantom's mask is revealed. I really almost hid under my blankets because the face was so creepy, haunting, and melancholy to watch! It's truly a classic moment in film history, it's one that's truly memorable, and one which truly makes you feel the heart and soul of the phantom himself. Also, the other classic moment in this film was when the phantom was dressed as the Red Death with his haunting skull face, classic! I just find it unfortunate that every remake of Phantom of the Opera further takes away the haunting and chilling deformity of the phantom's face and replacing it with a more polished looking villian (which has now resorted to an almost handsome and gorgeous looking phantom as it's shown from the 2004 version). Also, the Red Death scene is becoming more and more diminished as it's being replaced with a simple red outfit with a cape! What happened to the real phantom that gives you chills, makes you cringe at his ugliness, and yet makes you sympathize with his sadness? I guess this version is the only one that has and ever will portray the true phantom, and thankfully, this classic silent film still lives on today for us to enjoy, regardless of how outdated it may be.",1118361600,,1674,4.546357615894039

It was directed, acted, and filmed within your own blood and on the stage of your own brain - a closet drama that grows in relevance and power with each passing year.

Most of us who come to see the film for the first time think we already know what Lon Cheney's masterwork of a face looks like.  But we are wrong. Movie stills and photos in books of the history of horror movies almost hide the secret power lurking in that face exactly the way photographs of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa actually obscure what that particular face is all about.  Just as you must fly to Paris and go to the Louvre to behold the true Mona Lisa, so also must you watch Lon Cheney in action.

He is the nightmare figure that haunts us at the bottom of our dreams and through subtlety and crafts perverts our waking hours.  The Opera is real, so also are the dark chambers and haunted halls beneathe the Opera.

Alas, if only Eric could have remained in his fortress of solitude, but no, he had to fall in love with an operatic stand-in named Christine (Mary Philbin)!

His ability to look bizarre and otherworldly is unmatched. His silent scream during the unmasking is an indelible horror image. The Phantom's entrance at the Bal Masque is a true show-stopper!

You miss out so much when you don't get the chance to see the original cut of a movie. Most of the time an editor or a director can achieve an entire change in plot by simply leaving certain snips of the finished cut out of the released cut. This is what makes the Mileston edition of the Phantom of the Opera so precious.

Not only does the DVD come with the 1929 edition of the film that most people can buy on the bargain shelves, but it also includes the very rare original cut of the film (I believe it was made in 1925). This original cut is several minutes longer than the later cut that has become so much more famous, and includes plot developements excluded from the later cut (such as more scenes concerning Roul and his brother, Phillipe, which make their relationship stronger; the original ending to the film; and several scenes that add both mystery and emotion to the character of the phantom himself).

Take the word of some one who grew up believing that the 1929 version was the best version ever produced of this film, there is so much more to offer with this Mileston edition! It is well worth it, and you'll thank yourself for buying this version.",1113609600,,1399,4.3938223938223935
2999319,5,B000X7SD6S,"Carl Laemmle's screen version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (based on the penny-dreadful by Gaston Leroux), is still a fascinating and riveting screen entertainment, despite being re-made several times (including 2 updates from Universal), not to mention Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage musical.

Lon Chaney gives the performance of his career as Erik, the tortured Phantom who roams the sewers and labyrinths of the Paris Opera House.  His attentions are piqued by the beautiful young singer Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) though she is already being courted by Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny (Norman Kerry).  As passions rise, the young lovers are terrorised by the demonic Phantom as he vows to make Christine his bride...

Lon Chaney turns in a polished performance as Erik (riding high on the success of his legendary turn as Quasimodo in Universal's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME).  Mary Philbin's ethereal beauty serves her well as Christine, and Norman Kerry does all he can to overcome the one-dimensional character of Raoul.

The set built for the Paris Opera House was the biggest and most elaborate free-standing set ever assembled for a picture at the time.  The lavish 'Bal Masque' sequence was shot in the relatively new 2-strip Technicolor process.

The original silent version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA premiered in 1925, but when the advent of sound occurred in 1929, Laemmle released a new print of PHANTOM with the voices dubbed in (sans Lon Chaney) and new ballet and opera sequences inserted. The film was re-edited by Walter Anthony.

The version that most people would have seen is actually a composite of the 1925 and 1929 versions.  The print features the tinting (done according to the original 1925 specifications) and the new ballet/opera sequences, with a full orchestral score provided by Gabriel Thibaudoux.  The original 1925 version is rarely-seen because of it's badly deteriorated picture.",1111104000,,1924,5.214285714285714

Thats right, when you see this film, the incredible skull head Lon wears is his creation. The phantom mask he wears over it is another creation of Chaney. It was made to look like painted on dolls eyes, which as scene changed the mask would change. When you see this film, don't see it look for a exact portayal of the book, because its not.

At the same, a beautiful understudy for the opera prima donna had been singing lessons form the mysterious ghost. The ghost then proclaims that the star be replaced by Miss Dae or there will consequences. Of course no listens and the star goes on, but then in a well known moment when the phantom causes the chandlier to fall of from the ceiling of the opera house.

2999321,5,B000X7SD6S,"At a moment when the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera is hitting the screen, some viewers may be interested in taking a look at the movie that started it all. Whether or not this DVD set put out by Milestone is really the ""Ultimate Edition"" Phantom of the Opera I do not claim to know, but it will certainly do until something better comes along. The set consists of a pair of DVDs that offer two versions of the picture. According to the commentary, the 1925 version only survives in a 16mm print held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and this is offered on the second disk.

However, after the arrival of sound, in 1929, Universal decided to put out an ""improved"" reissue of one of its biggest silent hits, with some new footage, and a synchronized music and effects track. Surprisingly, in spite of occasional, rather clumsily interpolated sections of asynchronous dialogue in which voices sometimes supplement the intertitles and sometimes repeat them, the reissue is mainly an improvement. And the Milestone set, by offering both the original release and the reissue, gives viewers a rare opportunity to compare the earlier and later versions of one of most famous American productions of the silent era.

Fortunately, a 35mm copy of the reissue, struck from a negative made in 1930 for the international market, was preserved by the late James Card, the curator of the Eastman House. It is this version, restored by Photoplay Productions, replete with the original tinting and enhanced by restored color sequences, which forms the pice de rsistance of this ""Ultimate"" Phantom of the Opera. The DVD even offers a pair of soundtracks-the original one from 1930 and a fancier stereo one, with music composed by Carl Davis and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic. The picture quality of this version, effectively reproduced by the digital processing, will certainly come as a surprise to anyone who has only seen dupey, third or later generation copies of silent classics like The Phantom of the Opera. Especially worth looking at more than once is the sequence of the masked opera ball. With the color restored, this is clearly one of the high points in the early history of horror films.

It would be misleading to call The Phantom of the Opera a great motion picture. Universal was always a rather tacky studio, and the production values of the movie are inferior to those of pictures being made by MGM and Paramount, although some shots of Erik's subterranean realm have a genuine magic. Moreover, the performers are uniformly mediocre, with one spectacular exception. And Phantom of the Opera remains an impressive viewing experience today just because of that one exception: Lon Chaney's superb interpretation of the role of Erik, the phantom of the title. If Helen of Troy's was the face that launched a thousand ships, Lon Chaney's was the face that launched a hit movie, in addition to a couple of remakes, various Phantom wannabes, and, more recently, the Broadway hit.

The first Phantom was putatively directed by a hack named Rupert Julian, who is otherwise remembered for having finished up Merry Go Round after Universal fired Erich von Stroheim. As Scott MacQueen's excellent commentary to the 1929 reissue makes clear, however, Chaney-who could not stand Julian-must have had a considerable influence upon the finished movie. It is only an exercise in frustration to speculate what might have resulted had Chaney been able to collaborate with the gifted and sympathetic Tod Browning, who had just directed him in the perversely entertaining thriller The Unholy Three.

To present day spectators accustomed to scenes of carnage realistically depicted to the last drop of gore, Chaney's makeup will seem only modestly frightening, but that is hardly the point. Chaney invests his role with a carnal intensity screen performers rarely succeeded in doing after sound came in. A shot of his fingers suspended in midair, tentatively gesticulating before he touches the unwitting Christine carries just as much electricity as the famous moment when she undoes his mask and reveals his mutilated face.

More importantly, Chaney gives us a grandiose Romantic villain cut from the same cloth as Byron's Manfred or Charles Robert Maturin's Melmoth. Erik is a great artist and wounded soul-although the movie, unlike Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, never gets around to explaining why-but also a diabolical madman, who thinks nothing of killing anyone who tries to stand in his way. In a monumental work, The Romantic Agony, Mario Praz showed how this typically Romantic figure filtered into popular literature during the nineteenth century, but Erik was anachronistic in 1910, and even more so in 1925.

The remake with Claude Rains in 1943 already depicted Erik more as a character to be pitied than feared, and the Webber super production turned Leroux's belated, but disturbing Romantic fable into a piece of super slush that might well be titled The Phantom of the Soap Opera. Chaney's genius was to be able to synthesize both sides of Erik's character: he does stir our pity-particularly when a street mob finishes him off at the end-but at the same time he frightens and even repels us. And Chaney stamped his personality on the role as much as Lugosi did on Count Dracula or Karloff on the Frankenstein monster.

This is one of the most outstanding DVD editions of a silent film classic I have ever seen; only some of the Criterion releases can touch it. Apart from the features already mentioned, the set also contains interviews, trailers, and a stills gallery. Now if only TCM would do something comparable for Flesh and the Devil, or Paramount for The Wedding March or The Last Command.",1105920000,,5772,4.992723492723493
2999322,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is the best version of Lon Chaney's The Phantom of the Opera I've seen.  Before the DVD, I'd only viewed a VHS copy which I purchased in the ""ten dollars or less"" bin.  If that is the only way you've seen the movie, you MUST WATCH THE DVD.  For instance, there was considerable use of primitive Technicolor in this film; much of the movie is b&w, but during the masked-ball sequence, the Phantom makes quite an entrance as Red Death.  Some of the color has proven irreparable, but the restorers have digitally colorized some sequences to try to recapture the original feel of the film.

The DVD set includes two discs - the 1925 version and the 1929 version.  To really appreciate the movie, YOU MUST WATCH WITH THE AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK!  We find out all the trouble (and there was a lot of it) that went into this movie.  For instance, the director (Rupert Julien) had no talent!  The studio kept botching the project, which is why there are umpteen different versions.  The commentator points out all of Julien's mistakes and the differences between the different versions.  As originally conceived, the movie was supposed to be ALMOST exactly like the book (which is why the Persian is in it).  Then, the geniuses in the studio wanted it altered and a version was shot which was NOTHING LIKE the book - this version was a comedy about Raoul.  Then, the different versions were pulled together.  The Persian was changed to a police inspector who wears an Astrakhan cap and eye makeup for no reason.  The Rat Catcher is still there, but unexplained.  Tragically, Erik's backstory (as in ALL versions) is ruined: he becomes merely an escapee from Devil's Island.  However, only this version and the Andrew Lloyd Weber version have a Phantom who was born disfigured and not the victim of acid-in-the-face.

What is amazing - listening to the commentary - is just how good the movie turned out to be.  It remained somewhat faithful to the book, retaining the best set pieces - the secret passages, box 5, the underground lake, the lair, the torture chamber, the horse, the masked ball, and (of course) the chandelier.  We are told that the true auteurs of this movie are the set designer and Lon Chaney himself.  This is Chaney's best performance and best makeup.  He really looks like the Phantom is described in the book.  He also designed his own mask with a whisk of linen at the bottom to show when he speaks.  Chaney supposedly directed his sequences himself, which seems likely because they are - by far - the best parts of the film.  Regardless of its shortcomings, the unmasking of the Phantom remains one of the greatest moments in silent cinema.",1103587200,,2661,4.683189655172414
2999323,4,B000X7SD6S,I have seen the silent Phantom of The Opera version many times over the years and i much prefer it with an added musical score. I swear the sets we see for tHe Paris opera house are the same as the ones later used in Tod Browning's Dracula (starring Bela Lugosi). As for the plot very well crafted. acting is very good (though the pretty lady who screams when she first sees the Phantom unmasked is a little too expressive).

Never before and hardly since there has been a version so magnificently mounted and idiomatic expressive , and personally I guess the plot fits adequately to mude movies , due his own nature allows .

The makeup is silmply magic . Directed by Rupert Julian a real and forgotten master director.

A personal advise to get involved in this surrealist mood ; watch first The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , The hands of Orlac at first , and once you are completely in expressionist waters , watch it .

2999325,1,B000X7SD6S,"This review refers solely to the Alpha Video DVD.

Alpha Video's DVD version of this silent classic is of poor quality.  The image quality is poor, it is grainy and scratched.  It lacks contrast and detail.  The film was improperly cropped; consequently some text of the credits and intertitles is not visible.  There are no DVD extras.  There is no logic to the chapter indexes.  The color scenes have faded so much that they appear to be devoid of any color.

Worst of all, the soundtrack is not synchronized to the film!  The Alpha Video DVD version uses public domain classical music, not a score composed for this film.

GREAT DVD with the original release version and then a later restored and semi-colorized version - both contain the hand touched ball sequence.

WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID?  This is possibly the definitive version - the later ones - the Raines and the Lom versions lack the special Chaney quality of Erik ..... immense danger yet compassion.

When watching the movie today - it very much becomes a grotesque ballet.  The performers are choreographed.

DVD contains numerous extras - including sound bites from a later version, interviews - especially interesting is the CARLA LAEMMLE [Uncle Carl's neice]who starred as the prima ballerina in ""Phanton"" - odd when we are shown stills from the dance sequence - a few dancers faces are mutilated - the photograph is specifically damaged ----wonder WHAT they sinned?

Chaney is the master of pantomime - using very small finger gestures in some of the scenes - to convey - it's very much a different style  ...

BUT the original 1925 print is dreadful - perhaps the FW MURNAU institute can take a look - they did brilliant work on Lange's recent ""Metropolis"" - however this present edition is something to cherish and protect!

2999328,4,B000X7SD6S,"The PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with Lon Chaney that most everyone knows is not the original version of the film. It is a 1929 reissue with several changes made to accomodate the addition of sound. Ironic that one of the most famous silent films of all time should be known from a sound version that lost its voice. New footage was shot, characters were changed and most important of all whole scenes were rearranged or eliminated altogether. This makes the storyline much harder to follow and interrupts the flow of the film when compared with the original which sticks much closer to Gaston Leroux's novella except for the rousing chase scene added at the end by the studio (shades of FATAL ATTRACTION!). Now thanks to Milestone/Image with this handsome 2 DVD set you can have both versions and make the comparison for yourself. As the 1929 film is discussed in much greater detail in several other reviews, I shall focus on the original 1925 version.

The biggest problem with it is that it hasn't been restored. Yet. There are reports that a restoration of it is underway along with Chaney's other famous Universal horror, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The problem is that both of these films exist only in 16mm reductions made for the home market back in the 1920's. While the quality will never be that of the 1929 version which exists in 35mm, it is possible as in the case of MERRY-GO-ROUND (which was also directed by Rupert Julian and discussed by me in a review of that film) to significantly improve the picture quality. I shall look forward to that day as I much prefer the 1925 version not only for a clearer storyline and better motivated characters (Raoul and Christine have more depth and Inspector Ledoux of the Secret Police actually makes sense) but for its more expressive title cards and overall pace. While longer than the 1929 reissue it seems shorter due to the way it unfolds drawing the viewer in more. It is a true silent film rather than one reedited for sound.

Until the restored version of the original appears this one will have to do and rates 4 stars instead of 5. Here's a tip to maximize your viewing experience. Decrease the brightness mode on your TV along with the contrast as this reduces the overall stark quality by softening the image. In closing special thanks should be given to Jon C. Mirsalis for creating a fine score to accompany the 1925 version. While not as sumptuous as the Carl Davis score for the other, it does set the mood perfectly.",1091404800,,2483,4.640909090909091
2999329,5,B000X7SD6S,"this was the best phantom movie ever made!!! it also includes the 1925 and '29 versions. the  25 version is a lot better because there are a few more scenes,better unmasking,and better chandalier scene. when i first saw the 29 version [i thought it was from 25 like many people] and i couldn't sleep for two weeks!

i was even afraid to look at chaney's face. for about a year i didn't see his face. but one evening i stumbled upon a vhs with his picture on it. i decided i wouldn't be terrified by an 80 year old movie, so i got a dvd of it from the library [the milestone version with the cover having the picture of mary philbin on the floor, and chaney grinning and pointing] i was instantly mesmorized. with my christmas money i bought the two disc version and i saw the  new york general release version for the first time. there is one problem with this dvd. the los angeles preview version [the one with the original ending and graveyard scenes] was not on one of these disks. neither was the san fransico world premiere version [the one with new ending and comedy relief, chester conklin] on these disks. are these two versions lost or did no one want to restore them. it's just like london after midnight. some idiot collector probably has it and is keeping it to his or her snobby self. but.....

2999330,5,B000X7SD6S,"It is a shame that in the popular imagination the classic 1925 silent version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has been reduced to the scene where Christine (Mary Philbin) unmasks the Phantom and reveals Lon Chaney's stunning make-up job. Because there is much more to this film than that sequence and the camera being out of focus as the Phantom moves towards Christine really bugs me (or was it on purpose?  After all, women might start fainting at a close up in clear focus).  Directed by Rupert Julian, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is an atmospheric horror story and Chaney's performance stands up even given the mannerisms required of actors in the silent era.
The visuals in this film are stunning, from the cavernous world below the Paris Opera house to the Phantom's entrance as the Red Death during the Masqurade Ball (filmed in Technicolor). For me the most memorable moment and Chaney's best scene comes at the end, when the Phantom is able to hold the mob that has hunted him down at bay because of the threat of what he holds in his hand. Then he starts to laugh at the fools, finally opening his hand to show it is empty and giving himself over to the violence of the mob. The scene is not in Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, which relates how the bones of Erik were found years after the events told in this story, but it is a worthy addition to the tale and provides a more dramatic conclusion for movie audiences to enjoy.
In regards to the famous unmasking scene, I do want to add that Rupert Julian's staging of the scene is really as impressive as the make-up, because the audience gets to see the face of the Phantom before Christine is presented with that horrible visage. I have always thought that Chaney's performance was so indelible that it was the reason that the Claude Reins and Herbert Lom remakes concocted an entirely new story, although it does make sense that when you add sound to the Phantom that you would take full advantage of the opera setting. Final note: When I got to see Michael Crawford perform as the Phantom in the Lloyd-Webber musical, I was not surprised that his outfit as the Red Death was clearly modeled on what Chaney wore in this film.",1088467200,,2181,4.532994923857868
2999331,5,B000X7SD6S,"Over the years, I have just about bought every version of the silent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. In my opinion, the Milestone version is THE BEST. The elements have been cleaned up and the image is crisp, clear with good contrast for 90% of the film. This two disc set has both the 1929 and hybrid 1925 original. Actually the film is cleaner and better looking in this version than a lot of the official Universal thirties classic that have come out.
It has an excellent commentary by Scott MacQueen and a real treat is hearing the music originally composed for the sound version accompanying the action from original sound elements.
The Technicolor sequences are the nicest I have seen and through proper use of the colorization process, other scenes originally in color, are presented and match the actual color stuff very well.
This version has been made from the initial Photoplay restoration which also includes Carl Davis' original stereo score for those that must have modern stereo for their films, however, I prefer the mood and music of the original '30 soundtrack. There are a plethora of extras, and I don't think it is false hype to say this is the ULTIMATE EDITION of this classic film.

There is so much to praise in this:
- The settings are marvellous. The gargoyle in the scene on the roof of the opera house, the grandiose opera itself, the parisian streets, and the dungeons!
- Lighting was marvellous: shadows on the walls in the first scene, shadows in the scene with the horse, shadows in the dungeon scenes.
- The characters are marvellous: Christine, Raoul, The Phantom, and a delightfully mysterious character who lurks about. Chaney is fantastic - remember acting had to be bigger in the silents, and emotions had to be conveyed with the body, and this can sometimes look a little stagey - but Chaney is fantastic in my two favourite scenes, the roof of the opera, and the whole closing sequence.
Look out for the unmasking scene, the Bal Masque (especially the scene on the roof) all scenes in the dungeons, for example when two characters set out to look for the Phantom.

2999333,5,B000X7SD6S,"This DVD has restored the original 1925 and 1929 versions of Lon Chaney's incredible performance in ""Phantom Of The Opera"". It's got better sound quality and picture, uses sequences from the Charles Gounod French opera ""Faust"", dialogue and musical soundtrack/score. It's a must have for fans of Lon Chaney and for those who admire the art of early horror in cinema. Lon Chaney was the first, real horror film star. He was known in his day as ""The Man With A Thousand Faces"". His films were tinged with horror, violence (whether external or internal), and heavy tragedy and melancholia. He morphed into different characters by putting on layers and layers of costume and make-up. He could be everything from the tragic murderer-clown in ""Laugh Clown Laugh"" (inspired by the Leoncavallo opera ""I Pagliacci"") the hunchback Quasimodo in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame and in this case the frightening living spectre in Phantom Of The Opera.
The Phantom Of The Opera was first a French novel. By the time of the 1925 and 1929 Lon Chaney film, it was already popular and a familiar story to many. Later, it would enjoy even more success in other film versions and even as a Broadway musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The simple but tragic story involves a pianist/organ player who was scarred for life in a fire in a theatre and forced to live under the new Paris Opera theatre. He has fallen in love with the soprano Christine. But he is feared and hated by those who work in the theatre- the ballerinas, conductor, musicians and singers ( who incidentally are rehearsing for performances of Gounod's Faust, an opera about the man who sold his soul to the Devil and regarded as Gothic and scary in its day) The sheer scale of suspense and horror in the film is tame by today's standards but it was great back then. It really is a film of great art. It would be a perfect addition to you're film collection. If you love Lon Chaney, this film is the one to get. You can always build upon Lon Chaney films since his movies are numerous. Five stars well earned.",1077494400,,2048,4.6291208791208796
2999334,3,B000X7SD6S,"Well, the other reviews have said it - this is a FANTASTIC restoration, and the availability of the 1925 version makes it even better. You get TWO prints of the film for the price of one.
But, the ghosting effect on the restored version is simply awful. Folks, there is not a SINGLE clear frame in the whole film! Every frame is a composite of two films frames, and the whole thing makes the film look very clear but very blurred at the same time.
It's an incredible shame that this wasn't handled correctly. There is NO excuse for a film of this high quality to be spoiled by poor transfer to video. None.
But then, some people will watch this and not notice anything wrong. Your mileage may vary.

I had no idea how badly Universal mutilated the film for the 1929 sound re-issue - the version we're all familiar with!  Most of the annoying continuity problems and other flaws, which I had assumed were caused by all the post-production tinkering Phantom went through before its general release, were apparently inflicted on the film at the time of the re-issue.  The 1925 version follows the novel more closely, scenes flow together more naturally, the characters' motivations are far more believable - heck, even the unmasking scene works better!  Despite the less-than pristine visual quality of the source material, the 1925 version in this collection is by far the superior film.
That said, it was still a treat (in a campy kind of way) hearing the original sound track with the 1929 version, and the extra features are plentiful and worthwhile.  Carl Davis brings his usual genius to the party with his score for the restored 1929 version.

2999336,3,B000X7SD6S,"For starters, I agree with all the positive things said about this 2-disc set.
Unfortunately, there a couple of things about the discs that just spoiled the whole experience for me and may do so with you.
First, there is a ""motion blur"" or ""ghosting"" artifact that runs throughout the 1929/30 restoration. It looks similar to what a transfer from PAL video format to NTSC video format looks like only more exaggerated (images appear to be overlapped or double--sometimes triple--exposed). During the unmasking, Chaney's face is unnecessarily blurred, even when using freeze frame and stepping through the scene frame by frame.
Milestone has acknowledged the ""ghosting"", attributing it to adjusting the frame rate of the film during transfer from video master to video master. Incidentally, the original video master was in PAL format and was converted to NTSC for US, but Milestone claims PAL to NTSC was not the cause. Since they performed the additional restoration/picture cleaning on the overly ""ghosted"" transfer, it became a trade-off as to whether to present the cleaned up version or the ""unghosted"" version. Why such extensive restoration was done to a video master with excessive motion blur is beyond me.
For some folks, this will be a minor thing. For others, it will be very distracting and cast a dark cloud over what looks like to be the cleanest `print' of this movie in existence. I will be keeping the other Image DVD edition with the David Shepherd restoration.
Secondly, for the special features, the pause, fast forward, and reverse functions have been disabled. This can be a bit of a nuisance. For example, there is a 21 minute ""restored version"" of the films' original premiere utilizing stills and expository text. This I was excited about. However, unless you are a speed reader, you won't be able to read everything in one viewing. You can't pause it, or ""rewind"" to read what you missed. It is like trying to enjoy a book (both text and pictures) with someone else turning the pages for you. If you miss something, you have to start over from page one and go through again.
Again, some of you won't care about the motion blur one iota. Others will feel as I do: This disc should've been a contender but instead, it feels like a missed opportunity.",1066780800,,2275,4.865979381443299
2999337,5,B000X7SD6S,"Most videotapes, DVDs, and even LaserDiscs are silent prints of the 1929 reissue. Here we finally see the true original 1925 version. The 1925 version only exists in this DVD set and an old LaserDisc from Blackhawk Films. Also, we finally hear the audio for the reissue - the first time for this to be available anywhere.
Disc 1 has the 1930 reissue which has at least one difference from all of the other versions. There is no man with a lantern at the beginning. For me, that was how I used to identify the reissue. The Blackhawk Films and Alpha DVDs (as well as every videotape edition I've seen) have a scene with a man holding a lantern supposedly giving a prologue speech - with no audio track. This scene is not on this DVD from Milestone. This scene is not necessary so we aren't missing much. The box claims this is the 1929 edition. The commentary says this is the 1930 international version, which could explain the difference. Since the commentary is done by a film expert, I tend to trust that source more.
The image quality seems better than any other edition of this movie. The color tinting is nicely done. You have the options to listen to the restored audio of the reissue, a nice score by Carl Davis, or commentary by Scott MacQueen.
It's nice to finally hear the reissue as it was intended. Although it was probably interesting to audiences at the time, it comes across as a bit cheesy. It's almost camp. Most of the spoken dialogue is unnecessary and simply rephrase some of the titles. It almost turns it into a B-movie. It seems no different from all of these other, more recent movies getting updated with CGI effects. Here Universal was trying to cash in on the new technology of ""talkies"" by simply updating a hit movie from a few years earlier.
Disc 1 also has all of the usual extras such as trailers and photo galleries. The photos are not still frames. It is a presentation with each photo appearing on screen for a set time. There are also photo reconstructions of the Los Angeles and San Francisco premier versions. The reconstructions are a series of still images used to show what these versions may have been like. It's not on the same level as the reconstruction of London After Midnight shown on TCM. These are very basic.
Disc 2 has the 1925 domestic, general release version originally shown in New York. (There are three different 1925 editions.) I can only compare this to my Blackhawk Films LaserDisc. Ironicly, this DVD has a man holding a lantern at the beginning after the opening titles. This scene was not on the Blackhawk Films' LaserDisc. However, there are titles for his speech. There are no wonderful prints of the original 1925 edition so this version doesn't have the same sharp image as the prints of the reissue. This is about as good as you're going to see. The 1925 version has more titles and more plot. It does have a longer running time. You're told more about each character, while in 1929, you mainly just got the name and a very brief description. This is the only video edition of the 1925 version with a musical score. (The LaserDisc provided the 1925 print as an extra with no sound.)
The Lon Chaney version of Phantom of the Opera is the only film version to follow the original novel fairly closely. The Persian becomes Ledoux of the Secret Police in this movie, and the ending is very different. There were remakes produced in 1943 with Claude Rains, 1962 with Herbert Lom, 1983 with Maximilian Schell, 1989 with Robert England, 1991 with Charles Dance, and 1999 with Julian Sands.
It's amazing how many times this movie has been remade, but for me, the Lon Chaney version remains the best. This DVD gives you the best presentation of Chaney's version that I have found to date. I would recommend this DVD set to any fan of the story.",1065571200,,3804,4.571010248901904
2999338,4,B000X7SD6S,"Not to repeat another reviewer's long but precise review, I want to add my recommendation of this most recent version of what is arguably Chaney's best work. What many fans don't realize is that the great unmasking scene was also filmed in color and is now missing. Stills of the original 1925 B&W unmasking show it from a slighly different angle. Chaney rejected the color version because the hot lights made the adhesive between his forehead and headpiece start to separate. But, ironically, it is the B&W version of the color footage that survives in both the 1925 and 1929 editions. It is a pity that the missing footage wasn't found fot his restoration. Maybe someday we'll get the version with sound dubbed in (except for Chaney who had died as well as no longer being with Universal). This set could have given us more of that while using the beautifully clear 1929 print. All in all, an excellent effort. If you have the past ones, this is better just as Kino's recent ""Metropolis"" is the one to have. Now it's time to settle back and enjoy the restored ""The Man Who Laughs.""",1064966400,,1083,4.616580310880829
2999339,2,B000X7SD6S,"The Phantom of the Opera is a great movie.  My only bone to pick is the horrendous score in the alpha video edition.  TPotO is a dark tale, it's a horror story for crying out loud and the score is happy, repetitive, and inappropriate.  It sounds as if someone took a greatest classical hits cd and slapped on the movie.  I can't complain too much because of the price, but still someone could have put a little thought and effort into it.  The picture is amazing though.  I enjoy the fullscreen version and the original black and white with the color masquerade scene.
bottom line: great movie, but find the best version.",1064966400,,621,4.5

*** UPDATED DEC-09-2012: ADDED REVIEW OF 1997 IMAGE/BLACKHAWK DVD EDITION ***

*** ORIGINAL REVIEW POSTED SEPT-30-2003: 2003 IMAGE/MILESTONE 2-DISC DVD EDITION ***

I'm lumping my reviews together, just like what Amazon is doing! The above 3 video editions of the Lon Chaney silent classic will be covered in this review. Also, see my video clip at the top of this review to see disc covers, film clip comparisons, etc. (For those who can't see my video clip, especially iOS users who can't see flash video, I posted an external link to the video in the comment section, but you need to go to Amazon's FULL site to see the comment section.)

The 2011 Blu-ray edition of the 1925 Lon Chaney horror classic ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is produced by Blackhawk Films (owned by restorer David Shepard) and distributed by Image Entertainment.  It has no corresponding DVD release.  Blackhawk and Image also released the 1997 DVD edition, and this Blu-ray carries over some of its material.

The initial release of the Blu-ray on Nov 1, 2011 had several manufacturing defects, but a corrected edition was released soon after, and a disc replacement program was set up.  Unfortunately, the replacement program was cancelled in December 2013.  So if you buy used copies from third-party sellers, be sure to ask which version is being sold.

The disc packaging does not indicate which edition is the corrected one.  The only way to identify it is to look at the menu screen.  The corrected disc has a menu that shows more information about the disc's content, while the uncorrected one only shows the score composers' names.  See my video clip above for what they look like.

The Blu-ray comes with 3 versions of the silent classic.  Listed first in the menu, the ""main"" version, as it were, seems to be the 24-frame-per-second, 78-minute version that has the best picture quality of the 3 versions.  Shown in 1080p high-definition, this is, needless to say, the best-looking version of the film ever.  The Technicolor Bal Masque sequence is present as well, as is the re-created hand-tinted red cape of the Phantom at rooftop.  24 fps is, of course, usually the wrong speed for silent films, but it IS the right speed for the 1929 sound version of the film.  And the print used for this Blu-ray (and, in fact, most video editions) happens to have come from the sound version, as indicated by the presence of actress Mary Fabian, a well-known soprano at the time who did her own singing for the sound version but DID NOT appear in the original silent version.  Also, the 24-fps version includes a vintage score accompaniment by Gaylord Carter that was recorded in 1974 at 24-fps speed.  Hence, the 24-fps presentation seems apt here.  Besides the Carter score, a more modern-sounding score by the renowned Alloy Orchestra is also included.

A strange thing occurs during the early ballet sequence: the dancers seem to be moving in slow motion for a few seconds.  My video clip above shows how it looks.  It is present in the corrected Blu-ray release, sadly, as well as the uncorrected one.  The 2003 Milestone DVD does not have this problem.

The 2nd version is presented at silent-film frame rate of 20 fps and runs 92-minute.  Made from the same print that yielded the 24-fps version (slow-motion dancers and all), the 20-fps version is, however, shown in 1080i (interlaced) and curiously has a lot more print damages.  How did the SAME print yield one version with few damages and another with lots of damages?  According to the Blu-ray's producer, the non-standard frame rate of 20 fps made it impossible to present it in 1080p and to apply digital cleanup to eliminate print damages on the picture, as it was done for the 24-fps version.  But for many people, 20fps is the proper speed for the silent version and they would probably wish that the 20-fps version is the cleaned-up version instead.  The 20-fps version is accompanied by Gabriel Thibaudeau's orchestral score (which includes operatic singing), the same score used for the 1997 DVD edition from Blackhawk & Image.  An informative full-length audio commentary track by composer and Lon Chaney expert Jon Mirsalis is also included.

The 3rd version is the original 1925 silent version.  Well, not really.  Original 35mm camera negatives of the silent version no longer survives.  What survive are 16mm prints that were made for private collectors in the 1930s, the so-called ""Show-at-Home"" prints, one of which was used for this Blu-ray.  Shown in 480i, the 16mm picture looks unsurprisingly bad, with murky details and print damages galore.  It doesn't help that Blackhawk/Image chose to use tinting for this version, and the added colors, especially the darker ones, obscure details even more.  The 2003 Milestone DVD, on the other hand, does not have tinting for the 1925 version, and it seems to look better as a result.  The Blu-ray's 1925 version includes piano music accompaniment by Frederick Hodges.

The Blu-ray has other supplements as well.  It carries over portion of the poorly-scanned still gallery from the 1997 DVD, while adding a few more high-quality scans.  Stills that have captions on the 1997 DVD, have none on the Blu-ray.  These stills, about 60 or so, comprise of set construction photos, behind-the-scenes photos, vintage movie posters and lobby cards, and hand-tinted screen captures of a surviving French print.

The film's shooting script and souvenir program are presented as slide-shows of still frames; words are smallish and hard to see even on my 50"" screen.  The script is shown as scans of typewritten pages; each page is only on the screen for a few seconds.  If you pause the screen, the 1080i display may cause text to look slightly garbled due to the interlacing effect.  That's 1080i by nature and that's why this kind of things are better shown in progressive 1080p.  The script identifies itself as ""the fifth revised shooting script circa 1924"", and it contains, like typical shooting scripts, scenes not shown in the final movie, such as Christine and Raoul's wedding at a church.

This Blu-ray is NOT a descendant of the 2003 Milestone DVD, as Blackhawk and Milestone are two different entities.  This Blu-ray is a descendant of the aforementioned 1997 Image/Blackhawk DVD.  The 2003 Milestone DVD is rumored to be succeeded by a Blu-ray edition from Milestone, but no official announcement has been made yet.

*** BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE 2003 MILESTONE DVD EDITION FROM SEPT-30-2003 ***

Although marred by static direction and stilted acting, the 1925 silent film THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is known primarily for the memorable contribution by Lon Chaney as an actor and makeup artist.  His moving portrayal of the disfigured escaped convict who haunts Paris Opera House is perhaps the sole reason to watch this film.  And his talent as a makeup artist helped create one of the most indelible images in film history: the skull-like head of the phantom that conveys sadness, anger, and horror at the same time.  This Region-1-only 2-disc DVD set from The Milestone Company includes two versions of this classic film: the 1925 version that was premiered in New York, and the 1929 re-edited silent version that is most often seen today.  The DVD also contains excellent supplements that give us a good overview of the film's rather remarkable history.

The rarely seen 1925 New York premiere version included on this DVD is untinted, runs 107 minutes, and was transferred from the only surviving 16mm reduction print.  Its video quality is understandably poor; sharpness and clarity are never satisfactory, and blemishes abound.  There are some notable differences between this version and the shorter, 93-min, 1929 re-edited version.  In the 1925 version, actors are introduced via their own title cards.  There is no ""Carlotta's mother"" character.  Carlotta is played by Virginia Pearson in both the opera and the dramatic scenes.  The chandelier sequence is edited more competently and thus played out a little more effectively.  There are more scenes in Christine's dressing room, so adequate suspense is built up before she meets the phantom.  There is also one crucial scene in a garden that explains why Christine is so enamored to the mysterious voice she hears.  In my opinion, the 1925 version is the superior version; it seems more complete and satisfying narratively than the edited 1929 version.

The 1929 edited silent version included on this DVD was transferred from a restored, re-tinted print made by the renowned film restoration company Photoplay Productions.  This is the best-looking version of PHANTOM to date.  It also looks much sharper and cleaner than the 1997 Image DVD.  Both DVDs offer the speed-corrected 1929 version, but the '97 Image DVD opens with a shot of a man holding a lantern walking past the camera, while the Milestone DVD, curiously, omits this so-called ""lantern man"" shot and opens at the opera house.  On both DVDs, the ""Bal Masque"" scene is shown in two-strip Technicolor, with the color on the Milestone disc looking a little more realistic.  Also, in order to duplicate the original film as much as possible, some of the color scenes on the Milestone disc were actually digitally colored (such as the phantom's red cape at the roof of the opera house), because there is no existing color footage for them.  On the '97 Image DVD, no digital coloring was used.

There was a ""talkie"" version of PHANTOM made in 1929, but unfortunately the print of that version was lost.  The dialogs and sound effects recorded for that version, however, survived.  To give the viewer a taste of the sound version, the Milestone DVD offers something interesting to accompany the 1929 silent version: a soundtrack composed of fragments of existing recordings of the sound version pieced together to fit the silent version as much as possible.  The result is still far from being a ""talkie"" track.  It has plenty of sound effects and spoken dialogs, but it has almost no synchronized talking.  Inter-titles are still present (because this is still the silent version).  There is, however, one opera sequence where the singing of actress Mary Fabian (who did her own singing) is perfectly synchronized with the picture, which is a wonder to watch.  The DVD also includes audio-only supplements of recorded dialogs, which give us further glimpses of the talkie version -- and of its rather incompetent voice acting.

Also accompanying the 1929 version is a superb audio commentary by PHANTOM expert Scott MacQueen.  He provides a wealth of information about the production history, the backgrounds of the cast and crew, the various versions of the film, the use of color, and the use of sound.  He deplores the incompetence of director Rupert Julian, and emphasizes that the true auteurs of the film were Chaney and set designer Ben Carr.  He points out that contemporary reviews indicate that the 1925 version contains Technicolor sequences in not only the Bal Masque scene, but also the opera sequences and the auditorium scenes (the extensive use of color must have been quite a spectacle for a silent film back then).  He recounts in great details (while speaking at a pretty fast pace) how the various versions of PHANTOM survived over the years -- the existing 1925 version originated from the so-called ""Show-at-home"" 16mm versions which Universal made for private collectors in the 1930s, while the surviving 1929 version was obtained by a Jim Card at Universal in the 1950s, and the Technicolor sequences was obtained from a 1930 dye transfer copy by restorationist David Shepherd.

To add even more value to an already superb package, the Milestone DVD also includes still-frame reconstructions of the Los Angeles and San Francisco premiere versions of PHANTOM.  These were the very first public showings of the film.  The Los Angeles version ended not with a chase scene as in later versions, but with the phantom dying alone at his piano.",1064880000,,12426,5.127670144063587
2999341,5,B000X7SD6S,"The IMAGE entertainment restoration of the 1929 ""Phantom of the Opera"" starring Lon Chaney is a bit hit. The two-disk set is definately the definitive choice to own by all serious collectors. The clarity is better than any version I've seen to date, and for the first time, the correct running speed has been instituted here. The tradeoff however, is that the motion is somewhat choppy from too few frames. The characters move in proper real-time, and for the first time, you can see naturalistic movement in such scenes as the opening ballet sequence.
True fans need look no further than this two-disk Masterpiece Collection set from IMAGE. This is definately the one to own! The film is tinted and comes in a selection of three seperate sound tracks to choose from: a terrific new orchestrated score, the original sound score from the 30s, and a voice-over commentary track, which is insightful.
The second disk contains the original 1925 film, which few people have ever seen today. The quality is poor, but there are many scenes that are different from the version that we're all familiar with. It's worth watching.
But you cannot beat the restoration of the 1929 version on disk one of this set. It isn't quite the job that KINO put into Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" last year, but is terrific nonetheless. Thank you IMAGE. Great DVD!",1064534400,,1336,4.8384279475982535
2999342,5,B000X7SD6S,"... THE ULTIMATE EDITION 2 DISC SET (Image/Milestone): WOW! I remember watching the restored Metropolis and wondered when someone would ever restore Phantom and Nosferatu as beautifully. Well, they're coming close. This isn't quite the restoration job of Metropolis, but damn, it's gotta be the absolute best that's available. As far as the three DVD's reviewed here, this by far is the best in clarity and dare I say, it's a gorgeous restoration worthy of the most jaded film buff's archive (all that's missing is MAGICIMAGE's Filmbook on the film as a companion piece). The film is tinted throughout, with the addition of the Handschiegl color process during the Apollo scene which I'd never seen before being a nice touch. Steve MacQueen's commentary provided some great insight into the movie's background. The optional score from the 1930 sound release was a welcome bonus track, being reedited to fit this ""remix"" of a film. Thusly, was the best viewing of this movie that I've ever had. The original 1925 version of the film is on disc two and is a bit murky, along the lines of the usual worn out print, but hell, you take what you can get and in this case I'll take it, having never seen THIS version of Phantom before. On my copy, despite the overall clarity of the restored movie ('29), I still noticed those trailing/blurred action lines thingies when a character was moving quickly. It may be a defect in my disc it may not, but everything else in the scenes (and this occured throught), stayed pretty clear, save for the  fast movement. Someone told me that was part of the restoration, which I thought odd, but who knows,I don't see it occuring in the other copies. Hmmm. Outside of that, this is quite the package. If you are serious about having this classic in your film library, this is the best bet. Until someone manages to come up with ALL of the versions, New York, LA, SF Reissue etc all together, then this truly has got to be the ULTIMATE EDITION!",1064188800,,1973,4.685878962536023
2999343,5,B000X7SD6S,"I have loved this movie for 20 years or more. It is my second favorite silent film. I cannot explain my astonishment of seeing this beautiful version on DVD. I have at least 2 other versions of this film on DVD and this is hands down the winner. First off, both the original 1925 version is here, plus the 1929 reissue is here as well. The reissue is far superior than all other versions. Almost pristine except for a couple of minor scratches. Even the scene with Mary Philbin in the custom made bedroom in the phantoms lair, which in all other versions looked like it was on the verge of deterioration is fixed up the best it could be here. Now for the audio. The good news is there are some of the original dialogue segments here on the original 1929 sountrack (though none with Lon Chaney) but they sound a little distorted so you have to listen carefully. They are essential however. Also The Bal Masque scene is the best resoration I have ever seen. Chaneys red cape looks fantastic. Too bad they couldn't locate any additional technicolor scenes (there were other scenes filmed that way, but they seem to be lost). The original 1925 version is here and it is complete but it does however not appear in the best of conditions. But better than nothing. Other than just a couple of seconds, there is no additional Chaney scenes. All in all a must have for your DVD collection.",1064102400,,1380,4.48015873015873
2999344,4,B000X7SD6S,"A bit of a let down after the ALW musical, but a fabulous interpretation! It is very true to the origional book, an aspect which most Phantom movies have lost. Lon Chaney is spectacular as Erik, the escaped madman who longs for the love of Christine Daae, played by a lovely Mary Philbin. I recommend getting the DVD so you can have better sound and visual quality. And yes, it does have that famous unmasking scene which ""made women faint with fright"" when it first came out in theatres.",1060819200,,488,4.49438202247191
2999345,5,B000X7SD6S,The Phantom of the Opera is definitely one of the most well knowm and well done horror movies of all time.  This DVD is no exception.  The movie was made well done and and corected to the right running speed.  There are also editional movie stills that are good to look at. A nice bonus was the original trailer of the movie.  If you are a fan of classic horror movies I couldn't recommend this movie more. Buy it!!!!!,1046217600,,418,4.253164556962025
2999346,5,B000X7SD6S,"There's a couple reviews on here that slam Image Entertainment for its DVD presentation of this Lon Chaney classic, particularly a harsh review entitled ""I hate this Image DVD."" I believe the reviewers who gave it a thumbs down must actually be the producers of inferior DVD/VHSeditions because the special collector's version I now own is spectacuar. Allow me to rebut the negative criticisms. 1. I like the tints. Ths IS the way the movie was originally exhibited and it certainly enhances the film. 2. The Thibaudoux score doesn't stop at all like some reviewers would make you believe. It is continuous throughtout the film and most deinitely increases the suspense. It's a wonderful composition and works great with the movie. 3. One reviewer complained that the black bars on each side of the screen makes him feel like he's watching the movie through a saloon door. Not the case for me. After the first minute, I didn't even realize the bars were there. Just like when I watch a widescreen movie, the black bars in this case don't bother me at all. At least I know I'm seeing the complete image. 4. The action flows smoothly and DOES NOT ""ooze"" aross the screen like molasses in January. I think they person who said that ought to stick with Keystone Kops flicks if that's what he or she is looking for. Overall, I enjoyed this DVD presentation of Phantom tremendously and highly recommend it. The Image version is, by far, the best on the market.",1040342400,,1454,4.705882352941177
2999347,4,B000X7SD6S,"I really remember watching this when I was little. I was a huge shipper of Phantom of the Opera and I had seen the actual musical, but I bought this and I really liked it. Now if I watch it, I do notice the animation is a little bad and it's actually rather strange, I still like it. It gets the basic idea across. Yay.",1039651200,,319,3.923076923076923
2999348,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is the best version of ""The phantom of the opera"" period.  First this is the complete version of the 1929 reissue version. It runs 94 minutes and is played at the correct running speed. The version on IMAGE runs 79 minutes, and also has little tidbits cut out. When I want to see a film, muchless a ""Classic"" film I want it complete! Second this film is shown in B+W. NO TINTS! This movie was filmed in Black and White and that is the way that it should be shown. NO greens,reds, blues, or purples. This DVD also includes the ""ORIGINAL"" technicolor Bal Masque sequence. Third off,no box presentation. Unlike the IMAGE DVD where the film is shown in a boxlike fasion (little bars on all 4 sides of the screen). This version covers the complete screen. There are (unfortunately) no bonus materials included and itwould have been nice to include the original 1925 version which has different footage than the 1929 reissue version which is included here. The price (...) however overcompensates for these little drawbacks. I am so happy to finally get one of my favorite films is this correct and respectful version. Bravo to Alpha Video for getting it right.",1037145600,,1160,4.686274509803922
2999349,3,B000X7SD6S,"(Five stars for the film itself, though.)
When I was a kid I had a VHS copy of this film put out by ""Goodtimes Video"", one of those cheapjack public domain knock-off operations.  There was no tinting, no technicolor, no score... but I loved it.  Every Halloween I'd watch Dracula, Frankenstein, and Phantom before I went trick-or-treating.  So I was eager to see what Image had done in this restored version.
In the opinion of this reviewer, it's bad news all around.
First of all, the Thibaudoux score is far from inspired.  It's generically spooky and has little to do dramatically with what's happening on screen.  There are a few gimmicky exceptions, which can cause much head scratching if you let them.  We can hear the soprano singing, but why not the audience screaming?  We can hear the Phantom playing his organ, but why not characters talking?  Do you see what an aesthetic can of worms this opens up?  And where's Carl Davis when you need him?
The score isn't continuous either.  It seems to have been recorded in hunks and pieces, so every now and then the music just stops - I guess for the orchestra members to toss back a shot of something to help get them through the recording session - and we're left with twenty or thirty seconds of complete silence, oftentimes in the middle of a tense sequence.
Compare this to the score for The Unknown that TCM uses and realize what might have been.
The film is also projected too slow.  Now, I realize that projection speed is a matter of fiery controversy.  If you want to see a real bench-clearing brawl, just walk into a room full of silent film fans and shout ""Metropolis should be played at 18!"", then sit back and watch the carnage as they tear each other to pieces.  But the much vaunted 20 frames a second on this DVD is way too slow for Phantom.  People don't move, they just sort of ooze across the screen like chilled molasses.  Frightened women don't peer around corners, they peeeeeeeerrrr arooouuuund coorrrrneeerrrs.  The unmasking scene has you looking at your watch, when it should be violent. The ballet is slow, the chandelier takes forever to fall; it's just all wrong.  (The final chase seems faster than the rest of the film, thank heaven.)
Silent films were usually projected faster than they were filmed.  Look at the stuff with Snitz Edwards and the ballerinas.  This is silent slapstick, and as Walter Kerr points out in his book The Silent Clowns, silent slapstick absolutely demands the abstractness that sped-up projection imparts.  It requires that the performers be ultra-quick, ultra-light on their feet, and more real than reality.  Sort of comic supermen.  Otherwise their actions don't seem funny, they just seem odd.  And that's just the way it is in this version of Phantom: a bunch of completely ordinary people behaving very strangely.  Imagine Chaplin moving like a normal person and you begin to get the idea of what we've lost here.
And I don't think this is merely a matter of my personal taste.  Back in my editing days I was told that the rule for showing text on the screen was to hold it there long enough that a normal reader can get through it twice.  In Phantom a number of letters from the Phantom to Christine are held up for the viewer to read.  On my old 24 fps tape I could read through the text twice, then just start on a third; on the image version I could read them FOUR TIMES.  This is just too darn long and too darn slow.
Now here's the real kicker.  Image decided in its wisdom to put black bands on all four sides of the screen.
ALL!
FOUR!
SIDES!
So we get a little postage-stamp-sized picture in the middle of a field of black.  It's like watching the action through the door of a speakeasy.
Again, I realize the frames of silents were a bit more square than a TV, but really, how much picture would we lose if it were full-screen?  A hair-thin strip along the top and bottom?  I wouldn't complain, believe me.  If Image gave you an option to view it full-screen, it would be alright, but I can't find this option anywhere in their bare-bones menu.
If the chug along score and tar-like pacing isn't enough to distance you from the action and keep you from getting emotionally involved, this masking should finish the job.
So what I'm saying is I'm disappointed.  Once again purism has diminished a great movie in order to ""save"" it.  If the cheap eighties knock-off is more entertaining than the twenty dollar high-brow edition, there's a problem.
NOTE: Some have said the transfer is out of focus...not so.  There are few times when it is SUPPOSED to be out of focus - the point of view shots of the terrified Christine during the unmasking scene, for instance - but the image is sharp elsewhere.  Occasionally there are hairs and junk at the edge of the frame. The technicolor is kind of faded compared to the pristine Ben Hur, but it's better than nothing.",1035417600,,4882,4.576524741081703
2999350,5,B000X7SD6S,"I thought the use of Switchblade Symphony was a great addition to this already classic horror/romance. Lon Chaney in his own right is a master on the silver screen, whom for his time had no equal. I recomend to watch this moviewith the light off, and some your love next to you.",1034035200,,278,4.365384615384615
2999351,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney's 1925 THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has always been more of a popular than a critical favorite, and this may account for the fact that it has never really been restored and preserved as well as one might hope.  Over the years dozens of companies have released versions of the film on VHS and DVD to the home market, and some have been quite bizarre.  I have encountered more than one video tape release without any score at all; a visually impressive 1993 video release by Video Treasures had an incredibly unsuitable pseudo-rock score by Rick Wakeman of the band Yes; the usually expert Kino actually includes a number of superfluious scenes added in 1929 for a semi-sound re-release.  So any purchase of this film is a very hit or miss affair, and I recommend that you borrow, rent, and seek the advice of friends before you actually purchase any particular copy.

That said, the silent version of THE PHANTOM is very much in the ""grand manner""--which is precisely why audiences love it and critics tend to dismiss it.  Everything about the film is larger than life just a bit campy.  The sets are enormous and frequently bizarre, the costumes are outrageous, and the entire cast plays in a very grand manner: Chaney is very, very broad here, and his make-up is justly famous; Mary Philbin totters improbably with horror in virtually every scene; Arthur Edmund Carewe has some of the weirdest eye make-up you'll ever see on screen.  Chandeliers crash, ballerinas twirl in terror, mirrors open, lakes drain, audiences panic, horses run away with carriages, peasants riot in the street, and there's even (in a good print) a very early color photography sequence.

It is all a TREMENDOUS amount of fun, and while I wouldn't class it with the truly great Chaney films (such as THE UNKNOWN, to name but one) it is still the best film version of the famous story to date.  Of all the films made of the Leroux novel, this one is easily the best--and, interestingly, is really closer to the novel's spirit than later adaptations, which tend to romanticize the Phantom.  A must have for any fan of silent film, and well worth the hunt for a really good print.

The weakness is the lack of plot and character development.  The movie starts the story in the middle, and you never learned how Erik became the Phantom, or of his mentor/pupil relationship with Christine and why she went with him into the catacombs.  If you don't already know the story, that part of the film doesn't make sense.  I guess someone decided they couldn't do adequate singing lessons in a silent movie.

This is definitely a Phantom with soul, as horrific as Chaney's appearance is. The cinematography, lighting and sets are all eye-popping, and there are dozens of images and scenes that will stay in your memory long after you see them. I did have to subtract one star because sadly, this classic silent has not been restored as well as some others from this time period. Silents are daunting to some people anyway, and unrestored silents are even more work for the viewer. Still and all, until a digitally restored version is made available, this is by far the best version of this seminal horror film you can get, and any serious film or horror collector will have a big hole in their collection 'til they get it!",1013040000,,818,4.7272727272727275
2999355,4,B000X7SD6S,"This title is a good buy for all fans. The correction of adapting to the origianl frame rate of 20fps helps the film not look so ""comical"" or ""Keystone Cops"" like. The movment of characters onscreen actually looks 'natural' for the first time since the film was probably made (although there still are some speeded-up sequences here and there). The score, while not fabulous, works overall and does not distract the viewer at all. This version is color tinted throughout and the ballroom scene has been fully colorized. But you can always switch your DVD player to black and white mode if it bugs you too much. Don't expect any transfer miracles in picture-quality, but it's an improvment over all VHS versions that I've seen. There's a nice ""making-of"" story on the jacket and some behind the scenes images on disk, but no other extras. A commentary would have been nice.

2999357,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney made over 150 films!!  99.9% of which were silent ones.  Chaney was born to deaf parents, which proved to be a great contributing factor to his acting genious of the silent screen!  Father of Lon Chaney Jr. (1941 Wolfman fame).  He died in 1930!
The ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" a nick name he received because of his unbelievable ability to be the master of disguise (both facial and body contortion wise).
This ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1925/this is the 1929 re-released 35mm version) DVD has recaptured the unique splendor of Gaston Leroux's famous novel of the same name and the genius of the Greatest Make-up and Acting genius of the Silent Screen, Lon Chaney.
Perfectly digitally remastered the Full Screen presentation is excellent with the original 2/color Technicolor ""Bal Masque"" scene and Technicolor hues to enhance this visual silent classic.  (Hue examples; Blue - Outside Sequences, Yellow - Inside the Opera House,  Green - Opera House Cellar,  Orange - Phantoms Catacombs, Red - The fire sequences).
A new Sychronized digital stereophonic orchestral score (by Gabriel Thibaudoux), to include operatic voice sequences, enhances the entertainment value of this great story.
Summary:  The masked Phantom (Lon Chaney), Erik horribly disfigured lives in the Catacombs beneath the Opera House in 19th Century Paris.  He falls in love with a young operatic understudy Christine (Mary Philbin a real life ballerina).  Kidnaps and holds her hostage in his Catacomb lair.  Cristene's boyfriend Raoul (Norman Kerry) pursue the Phantom into the dark world below.  The Phantoms famous ""Bal Masque"" and the ""Unmasking"" scenes high-light this Classic Silent Film.
This is considered by Hollywood to be the first great horror film and best of the silent era.
Extras: includes many stills with the construction of the Paris Opera House on Universal's backlot (today it stills stands as Stage 28.  Imagine that!)
The life of Lon Chaney can be enjoyed by the 1957 screen bio film ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" starring James Cagney as Lon. (see my review)
This is the best of Lon Chaney and a the taste of his and Hollywoods genius during the Silent years of Hollywood.  Enjoy!",1007078400,,2177,5.061624649859944
2999358,4,B000X7SD6S,"I viewing a copy of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" I chose the Kino version which had part of the masque colorized.  The edition also had the original trailer and an interview with an editor talking about the film.  Although I did not find that specific version here, the information I learned helped me to appreciate any edition.
First, this movie does not end like the book.  The film was to be extravagant and the entire opera house was built by the studio.  Because of this extravagance, the studio felt that the movie should have a more dramatic ending.  From the interview, I learned that they filmed many different endings and you will see the one they chose.  The chase scene was directed by a director of westerns since he knew how to direct horses.  The final scene also has a bit of improv by Lon Chaney which really seems to work.
This leads me to more on Lon Chaney.  Even with this make-up on and no dialogue (it is a silent movie), he has no problem is showing you all the emotions that his character goes through.  It is not just a monster terrorizing the people of the opera, but is a who really can not help himself.  Even the simplest of gestures speaks volumes from Chaney.
Without sound and buried in makeup, Chaney still presents us with a great movie.  Even though it is a silent film, you will have no trouble in getting involved in this film.",1005523200,,1364,4.416

The last time I saw this old silent classic was on Halloween in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, accompanied by a large and powerful organ. Wow!
Silent movies at their best--and this is surely one of the best--offer a totally different kind of performance, a pantomime closely akin to dance. All you have to do is look at the way Lon Chaney moves about to notice his singular grace. If there were sound, you'd think what a hambone, but in silent form it's quite effective. The thing I like best to fixate upon are his heels--I just love to see how he puts them down and swivels around!
""The Phantom of the Opera"" still can scare you, so make sure you have a strong arm to cling to!",996796800,,874,4.208333333333333
2999360,5,B000X7SD6S,"I saw this movie a long time ago on PBS during the night and i had no idea what to expect. I had not planned to see it but i did. And am i sure glad i did. This is one of the best silent movies i have ever seen and one of the best horror movies i have ever seen and it has made me a fan of Lon Chaney Sr. The story takes place in Paris in the late 19th century and it concerns a young opera singer (Mary Philbin) who is an understudy in the opera she is in and then out of nowhere she hears the voice of a mysterious man in her dressing room who promises to train her and help her so that she may become a great and famous opera singer. She does and in order to have her put in the lead role in the opera the phantom makes threats to the owners, threats which they do not heed and soon after something occurs( i won't spoil) which puts her in the spotlight. Soon after a man named Cagney( Norman Kerry) begins to suspect something and soon after she is kidnapped by the phantom and from then on the plot thickins so i won't say anymore. This is quite an effective melodrama which was adapted from Gaston Leroux's novel and it's one of the most faithful adaptations rightup until the end of the movie. At that point it changes the more subtle and quiet ending of the book to something a lot more bigger but it works. The acting may seem way over the top to audiences today but take into account that actors could not use their voices so they had to be bigger in their acting sometimes with good results and vice versa. And also  this movie has no official soundtrack, it depends on the video. Lon Chaney gives one of his best performances as The Phantom. He manages to be repulsive and sympathetic at the same time. The movie maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout and also watch out for the unmasking of the phantom! And also for a two strip technicolor sequence which was very rare for it's time.",995241600,,1899,4.132432432432433
2999361,4,B000X7SD6S,"First off, this is one of my favorite movies. Years ago, the Blackhawk Films videotape was the first prerecorded tape I ever purchased. I also own two different LaserDiscs of this movie, and I now have the DVD.
Out of all of the movie versions, this one remains the closest to the original 1911 novel. In 1943, they changed things so that Enrique (Erik) gets disfigured by acid. In 1962, the love story between The Phantom and Christine isn't there. In 1982, all of the names were changed for a made for TV movie. In the 80s, there was also an OK animated, made-for-video version. And so on... There are 9 movie versions I know about. I've seen 8 of them. The 9th is a Mexican version that seems to be lost.
Most video releases are of the 1929 reissue of the movie. They added more musical segments, and I think they added a few bits of dialogue too. There appears to be no version of this with the sound in place. The man with the lantern walking around in the beginning is supposed to be giving a little prologue speech. That's why there are no printed titles for him. I don't think this affects the ability to understand the movie.
Now here's what annoyed me about this release. This DVD was released by Image using Blackhawk Films' print. My Image/Blackhawk Films LaserDisc included both the 1929 version (with the Gaylord Carter organ score) and a silent copy of the true 1925 movie on a second disc. The 1925 version doesn't have the man with the lantern at the beginning, and there is a garden scene with Raoul and Christine. It's also a little longer. The 1925 print exists and was used by this same pair of companies. I don't understand why they didn't use that. New music was used for this DVD so they could have just written it for the 1925 version. However, I feel that the 1925 version doesn't get used because it only seems to exist in 16mm. The 1929 edition still exists in 35mm so the image for the DVD can be better. ...but the 1925 edition could have been an ""Extra"" on the DVD like it was for the LaserDisc.
Except for the lack of the true 1925 version, I still find this to be a great DVD and would recommend it.",995155200,,2132,4.35929648241206

I hear a lot of people going on and on about how goofy and poorly acted it is, but the fact is that at the time that was how movies were done. You got to take that into account while watching this.

The silence makes it boring after a while, but if you have something on in the background (maybe Webbers POTO) then you'll find it much more entertaining.

2999365,5,B000X7SD6S,"This early ""Phantom of the Opera"" is, in a word, a masterpiece.  None of the other film versions of the story come close to matching this one. It's a top notch production all the way through. As other reviewers have mentioned, the storyline (mostly the ending) of this ""Phantom"" has been altered and ""Hollywood-ized"". It is quite different from both the Gaston Leroux novel and later versions, including the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. However, it does preserve some of the best elements from the book and, on its own, is fantastic.
The costumes and settings were lavish and the other production elements were strong. The Opera Garnier was faithfully reproduced, down to the angels on the roof. Even small details were accounted for: Christine's room in the Phantom's lair, although only visible in a few scenes, was meticulously designed and furnished.
The two most famous scenes of the film--Erik's unmasking and the Technicolor Masked Ball--are still quite impressive. The designers made the most of the early Technicolor by costuming almost all of the Bal Masque guests in shades of green-blue, pink, white and black--colors that worked best with the two strip (red and green-blue) process. Since most of the performers wore masks, the problem of pasty skin tone was also avoided for the most part. The Phantom's appearance as the Red Death was extremely effective. In several shots, while Christine and Raoul fled to the roof, Erik's bright crimson costume was visible at the corners of the screen.
Lon Chaney really gave this film life for me. Unlike his co-star, Mary Philbin (who tended to be a bit melodramatic and overact), Chaney played Erik with controlled energy and intensity. Many of the best, and most chilling moments in the film came not from the major action scenes, or from Chaney's brilliant Phantom maekup, but from Erik's subtle gestures and expressions. For instance, during the Bal Masque, Erik spots Raoul and Christine on the balcony. He slowly clenches his hand into a fist, never once letting his gaze waver. It is only a simple action, but it perfectly conveys Erik's anger and malice.
Even if you are not normally a silent film fan, you'll probably enjoy this one.",982627200,,2196,4.983651226158038
2999366,4,B000X7SD6S,"I had seen this movie only once before - probably 25 years ago, though I've read the book (and, yes, the story has been altered from the book - but not nearly as much as subsequent versions, e.g., Claude Rains's 1943 Phantom, a real travesty for those who believe a movie should bear a decent resemblance to the original novel) and been fascinated with the images of Lon Chaney since I first read FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine in the '60's.
Having seen the negative review here re: the DVD being out of focus, I was a bit hesitant to buy it ... but I'm glad I did, as my DVD looks just fine as far as focus and clarity is concerned. Someday maybe someone will do a masterful digital restoration of this to clean it up and brighten it up in places, but this is still great for a 75-year-old movie that apparently has no original prints surviving (or at least the producers of this version don't claim access to original prints), and via the magic of DVD, you can have it forever (or for as long as DVD players are made).
A few scenes seem ""speeded up"" - e.g., the audience applauding, the conductor's baton waving, the crowd chasing Erik at the end - despite the claim that it was restored at the correct 20 fps speed. The added singing during the opera sequences is nice and unobtrusive, though it's at times funny when the person on the soundtrack is singing but the woman on-screen isn't seemingly saying/singing anything! Either a sync problem, or the ""silent"" actress didn't memorize all the words to the aria. Likewise, the organ music on the soundtrack could be synchronized better to go along with Erik's organ playing. Since they did add the singing, a future reissue could perhaps exhance the soundtrack to Dolby Digital 5.1 and add some unobtrusive but interesting sound effects to give a surround sound theater experience that would heighten the suspense and enjoyment.
The liner notes (the essay on the inside cover) say it was originally a two-hour movie, and though some description is given about how the film was cut and rearranged based on audience reaction to its initial showings, there is no explanation for the missing 25-30 minutes. I would like to know what has been lost or left out.

The movie was easy to follow with the subtitles and the closeups of the notes the Phantom was writing.
A powerful performance by Lon Chaney, and the catacombs below the Paris Opera House were indeed spooky and helped to make the later half of the movie that much more suspenseful.
I now have seen all movie versions of this. All of them were good, but not having seen many silent movies, this Phantom of the Opera truly captivated me. It is a shame that Chaney died before his time. I have read he only made one sound picture before his death in 1930. It would have been great had he made this role with sound. Truly haunting!
I would like to see Universal do another remake of Phantom of the Opera using the same style makeup Chaney had and follow the story line closely without adding all the blood and gore of today's flicks.

2999368,3,B000X7SD6S,"By far the best version of the first Phantom is the '98 British Film Institute's. Probably possessing the best orchestral score and certainly having the most striking retouching job to the print, this one far outshines any and all of the others, which are in some cases, complete hatchet jobs.  As for the movie itself, well, how can you classify a film that's so much superior to subsequent versions that it shines? Of course, in the Twenties, Universal had access to huge amounts of cash - hence the construction of that opera house (yes; they actually built it as a set and didn't use something that was already there) as well as a gem in Chaney. The fact that it's a silent picture is no barrier to fear in this. Chaney is creepier before his unmasking scene than during or after it. Philbin and Kerry are excellent foils for him. Interestingly enough, Leroux's unhorrific flavour is drowned out, completely leaving the viewer with an absence of sympathy for the skull-faced ghoul as he gets his head mashed and is thrown in the Seine at the end.  The BFI version is on PAL format, unfortunately, but, having seen half a dozen different companies try to get it right with rereleasing this on video, I have to declare that none of them can touch this one, available from Amazon.co.uk.",975628800,,1287,4.665198237885463

3233658,5,B000X7SD6S,"The Phantom of the Opera is the original silent feature film that inspired successive remakes and a Broadway musical. Lon Chaney, the Man of a Thousand Faces stars as Erik, the horribly disfigured man who haunts the passageways and underground chambers of the Paris Opera.

The story is simple. Erik is infatuated with soprano Christine Daae (Mary Philbin), understudy to the opera's star diva, Carlota. Through threats and intimidation and, eventually, more drastic means, the Phantom forces the opera management to let Christine perform. But this isn't enough for him. The Phantom kidnaps her and takes her into the depths of the operas sub-basements, where he lives and keeps a shrine devoted to Christine. Deep underground, alone with the Phantom, there is little chance of rescue. Norman Kerry stars as Raoul, Christines beloved, and Arthur Edmund Carewe appears as Ledoux, a mysterious presence who pops up here and there, his purpose not realized until late in the film.

This is Chaneys masterpiece, with make-up that is still frightening today. Chaney inserted discs into his nostrils to flare them, and had fish wire hold his mouth open so it could not be closed. With additional facial make-up and hairpiece, his Phantom takes on the appearance of a living cadaver.

This original version far outshines later tellings of the same story. The sets, in particular, are sumptuous and stood for decades on the Universal lot as the Phantom stage.

The Blu-ray release presents the 1929 theatrical version, restored from archival 35-millimeter elements, highlighted by the Technicolor Bal Masque sequence (in which the Phantom interrupts the revelry in the scarlet robes of the Red Death) and several meticulously hand-colored sequences. This Blu-ray release offers the film in two historically accurate projection speeds (each with two different soundtrack options). Bonus content includes the 1925 theatrical cut, which contains scenes that were removed from the 1929 release version, and lengthy excerpts from the 1930 sound version, which no longer survives intact.",1450569600,,2073,5.3496932515337425

Picture elements are from the 1929 export version, and because the available soundtrack for the 1929 re-release doesn't match this cut, it is presented (very effectively) as the silent picture, as it was created.

It was showing twice a day and packed every showing with reservations running for months. This Chaney vehicle was a big success financially for Universal Studios. One of the greatest horror-films ever made and certainly it remains at the pinnacle of all films produced during silent era. Chaney was on loan from MGM and he shattered audiences threshold for fear with his most grotesque face. His existence in the catacombs and dungeons beneath the Paris Opera not only terrified audiences but also the pretty young actress Mary Philbin. The actual Opera House was constructed at the Universal City containing five tiers of balcony and seating 3000 extras. Norman Kerry played Raoul, the fianc&eacute;e of Philbin. It was brilliantly directed by Rupert Julian, but he had to depart for the last scene since lead actor Lon Chaney did not agree with the director about the finale of the story. Edward Sedgwick was called in to shoot the final chase scene which totally engaged the theater audiences for the ultimate demise of the ugly and terrifying creature.

Lon Chaney charms as a super star and the movie itself is a masterpiece. I highly recommend this to all fans of Lon Chaney and horror films in general. Anyone interested in the silent era movies and in golden age of Hollywood would also appreciate this work.",1446595200,,1413,4.863070539419087
3233666,3,B000X7SD6S,"This review refers to the 2015 Blu Ray disc of ""The Phantom of The Opera"".

I absolutely love Kino and all the wonderful things they've done for my film collection over the years, so it pains me to say that this isn't a very compelling Blu Ray disc. The print isn't in very good shape, and when transferred to video, the center of the image seems to have been a bit ""lifted"" from the gate, so the edges are in sharp focus, but the center is a bit blurred.

This alone would have bothered me, but I also have the BFI Blu Ray of the same film (it's an import from Europe), and the image quality on that disc is absolutely stunning. That disc also features a surround-sound orchestral score from Carl Davis, which is much better than either stereo soundtrack on the Kino blu ray (as much as I enjoy the Alloy Orchestra, this score is just run-of-the-mill). In fact, the BFI disc is so good that when I compared the Kino to the BFI just out of curiosity, I ended up watching the whole BFI movie.

Having the film available on the Kino disc in two speeds (20fps and 24fps) sounds great, but the 20fps version suffers from the ""stuttering"" motion that others have complained about when referring to the earlier Milestone DVD. The motions of people do look more natural, but the stuttering is just too distracting. The BFI blu ray has a wee bit of the stuttering effect, but it's not objectionable.

Both the BFI and Kino versions have one reel of the 1929 sound release that was discovered recently in the Library of Congress. It's really interesting and is of the same quality on both presentations.

The Kino version has a great 53-minute extra that contains a lot of the 1929 audio track to listen to. When appropriate, it's synced to footage from the 1929 film, but for the most part it's just audio. Still worth listening to, though.

Again, I don't like criticizing Kino*, but this disc ain't the one to get. Buy the BFI import from amazon.co.uk if it's still available; you won't regret it. (NOTE: The BFI print is region-free, but it includes a PAL DVD version of the whole package as well, and also a PAL DVD of the ""Lon Chaney: Man Of A Thousand Faces"" documentary from TCM and Kevin Brownlow. If your bluray player can't handle PAL DVDs, you won't be able to view these two DVDs.)

3233668,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is for the new(2015) Kino two disc edition of the Phantom of the Opera. Kino of course issues nothing but quality releases and should be commended for another fine job here with the Phantom.
The story is by now a well known one. The Paris Opera House sits over the multi-layered catacombs of passages long closed,but with their own sinister histories. The House itself is being sold to new owners who,after sale,hear of its' possible association with a phantom ghost that frequents its floors. The opera's main contralto has received lettered threats from this phantom not to sing in its upcoming show,but to let a new up and comer do so,Christine Daee'. She does so, to much acclaim and rebukes her boyfriends pleas to marry him,telling him she must stay true to her art. However what he does not realize is that she has been getting help from a mysterious cloaked figure behind the scenes,and it is he that has propelled her career to the heights it is now.
The Phantom one day decides it is time that Christine meet him in person,and he does so by telling her to walk into her dressing room mirror. Once through she finds herself in the catacombs and facing a cloaked but masked figure. She is repelled by his visage but he pleads with her not to judge her by his appearance but by his love for her and her career. He takes her far below the Opera House to his lair. There he keeps her, warning her not to touch his mask. When she wakes the next day she finds him playing the organ. She listens but cannot control her urge to see what is under the mask. When she lifts it he stands and turns. She is horrified,falls to the floor and can barely speak. After much pleading the Phantom eventually relents and allows her to return to the Opera House above. But he warns that she must never see her boyfriend again.
Once back above Christine sends for her boyfriend and asks him to rescue her from the Phantom's grip. During a grand ball at the Opera House the Phantom appears dressed in a bright red cape and wearing the mask of death. He spies the two together and leaves. Later on the Opera roof the two talk and agree to leave after that night's performance. However the Phantom is above listening and will kibosh the plan.
Acting proactively,he snatches her during the performance after people's attention are focused on the huge chandelier which has fallen into the stunned crowd below(his doing of course).He takes her back down to his lair and fends off attempts by would be rescuers. One of them is her boyfriend,whom she saves by agreeing to stay with the Phantom forever. However a frenzied mob also in pursuit of the girl and her captor rush his lair and he is forced to flee with Christine in a carriage above. During his getaway Christine is thrown free and the carriage goes but a little further until a wheel comes loose and the Phantom is at the mercy of the crowd. He at first keeps them at bay with a clutched hand,feigning that he has an explosive in it. When he reveals an empty hand,laughing madly,the crowd pounces on him,works him over and throws his apparently lifeless body into the Seine river.
It is certainly a compelling story. The acting however can appear to be a bit too melodramatic at times and tends to interfere with the mood. Chaney,as always,is the center the movie pivots on and he is marvelous to behold. His costume changes and facial effects are astonishing even today,as was his acting. Just simple hand gestures signified so much when Chaney was in control.
This new two disc set includes really THREE versions of the Phantom. The 1929 re-release in a 20-fps or 24 fps,format. For me the 20 fps mimicked a more natural movement by all concerned ,so I found it the more pleasing of the two. It also includes the original 1925 version which really is the ONE to watch, as the re-release was edited slightly differently than the original, with the original much more explanatory with its characters and their relationship to each other. Remember though , the famous Technicolour sequence can only be found in the 1929 release.
All the prints can at times be""rough""looking,so one must consider their ages when viewing these films.
Extras include excerpts from the 1930 Sound Version(sound on disc,with only part of the film extant),the original trailer,the original screenplay,an interview with the composer of the new music track and two travelogue films from 1925 Paris.
All in all a wonderful re-release by Kino of the original Phantom of the Opera. As the market stands right now,THIS is the version to own. There just are not any better versions of this film anywhere,and there probably will not be for years to come. Highly recommended.",1445126400,,4686,4.6606280193236715

The 1929 films were reedited, with other parts refilmed, like a portion of the ballet sequence. The 20 frame per second version also comes with an excellent commentary by Dr. Jon Mirsalis, and an orchestral score by Gabriel Thibaudeau. The 24 frames per second film version comes with Gaylord Carter's organ score or a brand new score by the Alloy Orchestra which is very good, and moody/creepy.

3233696,5,B000X7SD6S,"Up to now, I'd never seen the entireity of Lon Chaney's portrayal!  I'd only remembered seeing pictures of him as the Phantom in a book of movie monsters in a neighbor's house growing up as a kid.  Of course, even then, I was rivetted, mesmerized.

His Phantom is undoubtedly the scariest-LOOKING Phantom of all the stage and screen incarnations, thanks to his own grotesque prosthetic makeup, with a face that is essentially a rotten corpse, a skeleton...with eyes.  And his use of his hands and fingers is positively insidious.  Later actor Ian McDiarmid, who portrayed the Emperor in the Star Wars movies, was no doubt inspired by Lon Chaney's Phantom!

There are three versions of the film on blu-ray:

Version 1 is clearly the best-looking print, with the least amount of speckles, dirt, scratches and other damage.

Version 2 is a slightly inferior print, but has by far THE BEST musical score.  The music really captures the plight and tragedy of the Phantom, his being condemned to an eternity of isolation due to his hideous face, and his unrequited love for Christine, who begs him that she'll be his eternal slave if only he releases her, then promptly goes to her lover Raoul and begs him to take her and flee.

Version 3 looks the worst of the three versions, essentially like a PAL VHS, unworthy of blu-ray release, except that it is apparently the only archival version of the original 1925 cut.

Versions 1 and 2 are ""reissue"" cuts, apparently made from European release print masters, which I actually prefer, not only for their improved visual quality but for their extensions in scenes of certain dramatic moments, longer musical numbers and better placement of the camera.  There were reportedly, according to the excellent commentary track in version 2, two cameras filming Phantom at the same time, one for the U.S. release print, one for the European release print.  This is especially evident during the Phantom's ""reveal"", when Christine pulls his mask off to reveal his grotesque face and as he subsequently towers over her (us, in her point of view).  In the 1925 version, the Phantom is looking off-camera...and it's not as scary.  And there are more closeups of the Phantom hovering above Christine and Raoul in the towering gargoyle statue above them in the 1929 reissue versions than in the 1925 version.

I can't wait to discover what is left of, of the nitrate prints that survived decomposition before being printed on later film stock, Lon Chaney's other fine screen acting work!",1405123200,,2514,4.893867924528302

3233700,4,B000X7SD6S,"After a reviewer's review told me that his DVD with the 1929 re-release of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA had lovely colour tinting of the black and white done in 1929 of the film and a great music score composed by Gabriel Thibaudoux for the movie, I ordered this re-release title and I was immediatly delighted by the score, and the silent movie performances such as the frightened ballet dancers with them running in fear of the phantom accompanied by the running music, the comic releif stagehand and the other stagehand, Bouquet with his scarey description of the mysterious Phantom. While most of the actors are not in the same class as Lon Chaney they have good humourous moments and keep the story moving well. And the tinted colours are used to good effect whether it's a night blue for outdoor night scences or a hot red colour for when the Phantom tries to roast the undercover police agent and Christine's boyfriend who loves Christine, the opera singer that the Phantom wants for himself! Whenever rival opera singer Carlotta's stage mother  enters a scene the music sounds like, "" the General has entered the building!"" and plays like a military march which matches the broad gestures of a diva stage mother who is used to getting her own way! When Christine was first spoken to by the Phantom with a melodious sound, according to the title cards, the music used a strange, errie sound witha hypnotic feel and after the Phantom has played his organ the music burst into loud, rising notes that seem to echo the Phantom's mocking laugh after Christine has ripped off his mask and witnessed his gruesome face!

But then Chaney covered his face in dispair and his expression dropped down into a look of sheer pain and sorrow. Lon Chaney had such control over every gesture and expression of not just his face but his whole body! It's not just WHAT he did with his hands but HOW he did it! How he moved from being rejected to a look of wicked glee as he schemed of what he would do next to his pursuers I found so fasinating!! But Mary Philbin's Christine performence so sadly went downhill! While Chaney is so convincing as the Phantom with a tortured soul, Mary as Christine kept clasping her hands repeatedly (how many times did she do that!?) and her attempts at acting frightened led to some pretty bad facial expressions! Her best moment was when she started reaching to pull off Chaney's plastic mask! She slowly moved her hands forward, then pulled her hands back before trying again while her eyes showed she was truly curious as to what his face looked like! She actually had good subtle performance moves there!

But the rest of her movie performance is an embarassment! At times her acting reminded me of ""Lucy Ricardo"" trying to break into ""Ricky's"" act in I LOVE LUCY if you know what I mean! She is the ""fly in the ointment!"" But I enjoyed everyone else! The Masque ball 2 strip techicolour scene I compared to Roger Corman's MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH movie starring Vincent Price! Vincent Price's performence as THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES was clearly modeled after Chaney's PHANTOM! The music added a macabre feeling to the Phantom's entrance as the costumed Red Death complete with a skull face!

The final moment (Spoiler Alert!) showed the Phantom cornered in front of a river and he managed to frighten the angry mob by pretending to have a bomb consealed in his fist! But then he opened his hand to reveal there was nothing there! Chaney laughed as if to say,"" I fooled you again!"" before the mob beat him up and threw him in the river! The Phantom was a tragic trickster and a frightening, sad, rejected man thanks to the performence skills of Lon Chaney!",1397606400,,3674,4.639016897081413

3233703,5,B000X7SD6S,"When one is going to watch a silent film on DVD in the 21st century, two things are of paramount importance:  the quality of the image restoration, and the soundtrack that accompanies the film.  This most excellent DVD contains THREE versions of the film:
  1.  The 1929 reissue version (24 frames per second), expertly restored, with musical score by the ALLOY ORCHESTRA or Gaylord Carter's organ score;
  2.  The 1929 Reissue version (20 frames per second) with Gabriel Thibodeau's orchestral score; and
  3.  The original 1925 version, with a piano score by Frederick Hodges.

Thanks ENORMOUSLY to the other reviewer who posted a scan of the back cover, giving us information that Amazon couldn't be bothered to provide.

The importance of the musical score cannot be overstated.  The first time I saw Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, it was in a little silent-movie theater with live organ accompaniment, and I was absolutely blown away, despite the poor quality of the film they had.  The next time I saw it was on an early VHS release and I was utterly let down -- the image quality was marginally better, but the ""accompaniment"" was just some cheap, public-domain ""classical"" stuff that sawed on dolefully in the background without any reference to what was happening in the film.  It was a horrible, soporific experience.

THAT BEING SAID, the Alloy Orchestra is the absolute best for accompanying silent films.  NOBODY else comes close, except for live accompanists who are watching the screen and using the music to properly underscore and enhance what's happening.  This DVD (specifically version 1 with the Alloy score) is to my mind the perfect PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, at last.  If you like this, be sure to get their version of Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL as well.  And now, if ONLY we could get their METROPOLIS score as the soundtrack to a beautifully-restored DVD ... sigh!",1390348800,,1880,4.923566878980892

I was a little disappointed knowing that the re-relase in 1929 was redone with sound and that the whole film was not dubbed. Lon Cahney is the most ghastly phantom by far and follows closely what Leroux described in his book.

The choice she is given, to turn a scorpion or a grasshopper figurine, just seems odd, why not just a yes or no, but perhaps that was in the original book. And it doesn't make any sense to me why Raoul and Christine would wait to make their escape. Why not leave for England right away, why go back one more time to the haunted Opera House. I mean the show must go on, but that's just seems like a very stupid choice to make.

While this version is much better than the 1943 version we reviewed last year, it doesn't really hold up as well as I would have hoped. I can't imagine viewers of the 1920's weren't thinking the same things I was thinking while watching it.

However, the film should be seen if only for the reveal scene in the film, which I had to imagine at the time was very powerful. Sadly, we've all seen at least that part of the film by now, so that power has been reduced to curiosity.",1382832000,,1014,4.168367346938775

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because there wasn't any new information that I already heard and the tour of Universal's Stage 28 (The Phantom Stage) never happened -- which is the main reason why I bought the blasted DVD!! Save for a few pictures, we had no tour, which made me sad.

3233718,4,B000X7SD6S,"This first movie version of The Phantom of the Opera was released in 1925, starring ""the man of a thousand faces"", Lon Chaney, as the Phantom. In an era when some actors still did their own makeup, Chaney was the master of grotesque transformations. The Phantom and the Hunchback of Notre Dame are his best known roles, both requiring extreme makeup for a shocking effect. The famous unmasking scene in Phantom is one of the highlights of early motion pictures, and reportedly caused shrieking and fainting among the audience.

In 1929, four years after its initial release, Phantom of the Opera was re-released in a newly edited version. Some major changes were made, including re-scripting so that the actress who portrayed ""Carlotta"" in the 1925 version became Carlotta's mother in the 1929 version. This required changing some of the on-screen written dialogue (remember, this was a silent film) so that the actress was now outraged on behalf of her daughter, whereas in 1925 she was outraged on behalf of herself. This and other changes required the shooting of some new scenes. Print damage is evident in many places throughout the 1929 film, with significant damage in two scenes shot at the same time in the boudoir with the boat-shaped bed. Many scenes are color tinted, some sepia, some red, some blue. One long scene, the Masked Ball, is in a primitive two-color rendition, showing reds and greens.

The Blu-ray edition from Image Entertainment offers three versions of the film, with two prints of differing lengths for the 1929 reissue, and an original print from 1925. No restoration has been done on this film, with the video quality depending entirely on the as-found condition of the 35mm prints. The high-definition transcription brings out the best in the original source materials.

Now bear with me, this gets a little complicated. In a great oddity, the only way the various versions of the film are differentiated on the disc, and the only way to access them, is to select the musical accompaniment from the disc menu. The film versions themselves are not listed on the menu. What I will call ""Version 1"" runs 78 minutes, and has the best video quality, taken from a print in good condition. It can be identified and accessed by clicking on the Alloy Orchestra soundtrack. An alternate organ score by Gaylord Carter is also offered with Version 1.

""Version 2"" runs 92 minutes, and can be identified on the disc menu by the Gabriel Thibaudeau orchestral score. The video is significantly lower in quality than Version 1, but still very watchable. The extra 14 minutes are devoted mostly to an extended ballet scene early in the film, and an elaboration on the ""Carlotta and Carlotta's Mother"" theme. Version 2 also has an excellent commentary by Jon Mirsalis, which I recommend for its insights into the history of the film and of Lon Chaney.

""Version 3"" is the original 1925 film, running 114 minutes, identified on the disc menu by the Frederick Hodges piano score. It features the poorest video quality, and the trimming in 1929 actually improved the story. According to information on the disc case, it was supposedly taken from a ""6 millimeter source"", which I am sure was intended to say a 16mm source. The standard-definition 1925 version is of interest only for comparison with the 1929 reissue.

This is the first Phantom movie, featuring one of the great actors of the silent era, on a Blu-ray disc with two high-definition versions of the re-edited film from 1929, plus the standard-definition 1925 original. It is a fine addition to a film collection, and well worth the minor hassle required to find the various versions on the disc.",1378598400,,3670,4.892282958199357
3233719,5,B000X7SD6S,"There have been many remakes of Leroux's novel, Phantom of the Opera, but only this version goes along with the book. The only huge difference between book and movie is the ending.",1375660800,,180,4.65625
3233720,4,B000X7SD6S,"This movie is no doubt one of the all-time grand productions of the silent era--not to mention one of the more memorable, due in very large part to the talents of Lon Chaney Sr., who created one of the most memorable visages in all of filmdom as Erik the Phantom. But is ""The Phantom of the Opera"" a truly great movie? I would say parts of it are great, or at least memorable.

We all know about the ""unmasking scene"", which still packs a jolt 88 years after it was filmed. Erik's indignation as he points his accusing finger at the woman who violated his privacy, so to speak, turns to a mad sort of glee as he forces her to look upon his face (""feast your eyes--glut your soul on my accursed ugliness"") and seemingly just as quickly he turns away from her, knowing now that Christine has seen what's under the mask, his love will go on unrequited. That Chaney can win sympathy for such a hideous man is a testament to his talent.

On the flipside, there's the sequence with the chandelier, that seems to take forever building up to & when it finally does come crashing down, it's all over too quickly. As the picture moves towards its climax, you may start to wonder how indeed Erik managed to stay hidden for so many years. Before the movie is over, it seems like all of Paris is beating down his door trying to get at him. Did Erik start marking his trapdoors with X's?

Overall, I might be inclined to call this more of a great spectacle than film--a ""spectacle"" however that can still entertain and provide more than a few indelible memories.

Btw, the version of Phantom I have is the Image Entertainment DVD released several years ago. The color tinting was excellent & the print used was very good for a picture that's over 80 years old. Some spots of the film were a bit too dark, especially during the chase scene finale, but overall I was pleased with my purchase.",1375660800,,1876,4.3976945244956775

This was so much better than I was expecting ~ the length and breadth of scope is certainly there, but so are the facts, tidbits and fascinating footage which keep you glued to your seat.

The interviews are wonderful.  Technical quality is excellent. For a fan of Erik's this is a must.  This beautifully and lovingly traces the the evolution, history and adaption of a classic character and clearly illustrates how he's taken on a life of his own.

I have watched this several times, since purchasing it.  It is a wonderful; entertaining yet fascinating and has established a truly high benchmark for any future documentaries.  Good luck to THEM.... they've really got THEIR work cut out!

This project covers the Phantom in all his incarnations (clips and commentary of the films and other medias are included).
You certainly won't regret the purchase!",1372550400,,1125,4.848167539267016
3233723,4,B000X7SD6S,"This is a very intriguing movie, despite the fact that it is a silent film. It's very similar to the original novel by Gaston Leroux, except for in one significant detail... In the original story, Erik (the Phantom) is psychologically unstable, unloved, and horrific in appearance and often behavior. However, he also mirrors what is intrinsically human: the desire to be loved and accepted as we are. The interpretation of the classic story denied the Phantom this sense of humanity, which left me feeling very dissatisfied with the ending. On a brighter note, Lon Chaney's makeup is fantastic and believable!",1372032000,,610,5.11
3233724,5,B000X7SD6S,"I was hooked from the beginning. This tribute has it all, bringing back memories of the timeless classic horror films. Collecting the interviews as well as the posters, photos, clips, Aurora models and more clearly are a labor of love. I was particularly taken by the Carla Laemmie interview becuase she was in the 1925 silent film version of The Phantom and spoke with such clarity and passion. I'm very pleased that Mr. Hull has recorded her for history. Hugh Panaro, currently playing The Phamtom on Broadway, is another great interview as well as Michael Blake and Ron Chaney. Nothing has captured our hearts and minds like The Phantom whether it is on film or stage. This dvd has done them all justice.",1369958400,,707,4.7560975609756095
3233725,5,B000X7SD6S,"What a labor of love for one of the most memorable classic horror films this is!  ""The Phantom of the Opera: Unmasking the Masterpiece"" is over 100 minutes long and every second is pure gold.  I've watched it twice now--and enjoyed it even more the second time. It's obvious that a vast amount of painstaking research went into the documentary, but it never seems heavy or slow--it's always intriguing. Certainly a shining example of film history!  It's got it all!  I can't begin to guess how many photos and illustrations are used to accompany the interviews, but there must be hundreds.  The documentary is a feast for the eye from beginning to end.  There are photos, lobbies, posters--material I'd never before seen, and brilliantly presented. I found myself stopping and backing up the dvd time and again during my second viewing just so I could admire the beautiful artwork!

Impossible to say which of the interviews are ""best"". The interview with Carla Laemmle is a perfect example of living history.  Miss Laemmle was IN the 1925 silent version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA--she was interviewed when she was nearly 100 years old and was certainly one very bright and bubbly lady (indeed, I saw her at the Monsterpalooza convention this past April, and she's still bright and bubbly at 103!).  Her reminiscences about being on the Universal lot during the silent days are priceless, exciting and touching by turns.  Can't be many people left who can say they knew Lon Chaney Sr. and that they were close friends with Mary Philbin!  Miss Laemmle shares her personal experences with the viewer with such ease that it feels as though she's talking to you in your own living room.  What a treasure she is.

But then, ALL the interviews are great.  Chaney expert Michael Blake (has he ever been interviewed before?) was fascinating, as were Dan Roebuck and Steve Haberman--I learned so much I hadn't known before about the history of Phantom after Phantom--from Chaney to Claude Rains to Herbert Lom-- to James Cagney in MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES.  Wonderful anecdotes, solid history--the sort of combination that makes such scholarship a living, breathing thing.  Fun to see what Ron Chaney had to say about his great-grandpa's work, of course, and also to hear makeup genius Tom Savini and artist James Bama add from their considerable fund of info!  I'd have been pleased as it is just with the motion picture history--but Mr. Hull gives more than full measure to the viewer by adding material about the stage production of the Leroux story.  Hugh Panaro, longtime Phantom on Broadway, discusses his own experience at BEING the Phantom on stage and shares fascinating details about the makeup, the music, the stage magic.  Panaro's enthusiasm is contagious--no wonder the Phantom still lives on into the 21st Century on Broadway!

This is a documentary with both heart AND good content.  Now I want to re-watch the Chaney silent and track down the Rains and the Lom!  And maybe I can get to NYC to see Hugh Panaro!",1369872000,,3018,4.842105263157895

3233732,4,B000X7SD6S,"This is a great movie and an all-time classic. In this release, though, the music is a disaster. Someone just picked up three classical music pieces, put them together and looped the whole thing without even trying to match the scenes. I agree, creating a music score for the movie es quite expensive, but at least they could have chosen a wider variety of music and place it according to what happens in the different scenes. I happen to be a film composer, so I know what I'm talking about. I do this quite often to show directors what type of music could be used and it is not a difficult task.
Another thing quite disturbing is the copyright claim at the begining. This happens to be a movie in the public domain, due to Universal failing to renew the copyright in 1953. Companies shouldn't be allowed to take a work in the public domain, make copies of it and then claim a copyright over those copies. It should be illegal, if it isn't already illegal!
Despite all the above, I give it 4 stars just because the movie itself is a real treasure of the history of films and I wish to encourage other people to watch it.

3233733,4,B000X7SD6S,"OK, first off, it's the 1925 presentation of The Phantom of the Opera starring Lon Chaney. There is nothing wrong with the film in and of itself- it is still a masterpiece of early horror. If this is your cup of tea, then this will be a great addition to your movie collection. However, my review has to lose a star because I thought the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom was going to have at least one version that had been cleaned up & remastered to a pristine condition like what had been done to the Kino's 2010 Blu-Ray release of ""The Complete METROPOLIS"". Granted, I should have done a little more research - mea culpa. But alas, none of the three available versions on the disc have been cleaned in any way. They have all retained the scratches and the faded, discolored appearance of the film as it would appear if you played it in a projector today. If this doesn't bother you, then you should be just as happy with any other older, cheaper version of the film (lucky for me, I was able to get the Blu-Ray at a very discounted price so I do not feel as though I lost anything at all). If you're looking for a remastered version, as I was, then we're going to have to be a little more patient.",1356220800,,1198,4.258771929824562
3233734,5,B000X7SD6S,"The first version I watched is the 1929 reissue which was restored and presented at 20 frames per second and runs about 92 minutes.  This version features an orchestral score composed by Gabriel Thibaudeau and performed by I Musici de Montreal under Yuri Turovsky's conducting.  Claudine Cote handles various operatic performances.  This had always been my favorite ""Phantom"" among the many versions out there.  I liked the idea of the music following the staging of the Faust operas.  The synchronization wasn't perfect but seemed good enough.  Lon Chaney expert Jon Mirsalis adds an audio track to this version of the movie, but most of his commentary is less about the film and more about Chaney.  It is certainly informative for Chaney fans.  This Thibaudeau version certainly looks better than other attempts.  The only copy I had was a VHS tape which I can now thankfully toss.

Unfortunately this version isn't the best transfer included in this Image Entertainment package.  That distinction goes to the 78 minute transfer presented at 24 frames per second and includes 2 musical options.  The first is a new musical score by the Alloy Orchestra which did such good work on the silent documentary ""Man with the Movie Camera"" which was recently updated and released on DVD.  The second audio track is the generally well known Gaylord Carter's theater organ score.  I preferred the former but if you love that deep organ sound, Carter is for you.  The most exciting feature about this version is that the film itself is beautiful.  It is significantly better than the 92 minute version noted above.  While not perfect we see fewer flecks and burned edges.  Don't get me wrong.  If you are a fan of the Thibaudeau score, you'll get a longer movie and it certainly is watchable.  But this one looks better.

Finally, there is the original 1925 version which uses the 6 mm source copy and is presented in standard definition.  It runs 114 minutes and includes a piano score by Frederick Hodges.  It also differs from the other two in that it comes with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio compared to 1.2:1 for the other two.  It also differs in the fact that it is barely watchable compared to the restored revised 1929 versions.  Still at 1 hour and 54 minutes there are scenes here you won't see in other versions.

All 3 versions include some form of colorization and tinting.  Scenes change from sepia to black and white to green to red in varying shades.  Special features include an interview with Thibaudeau, some stills, film script and program reproduction.  I would have like to have seen some side-by-side comparisons and the ability to switch between all audio tracks would have been fun.

If you don't know the story here is a brief synopsis:  A disfigured man known as ""The Phantom"" lives below a Parisian opera house.  During performances, he even has his own box.  He has taken a keen interest in one of the performers, Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) who is the understudy to the primo soprano, Carlotta (Mary Fabian in '29 version).  The Phantom insists that Christine perform the lead.  She does and is a hit, but is replaced for the next performance by Carlotta.  This upsets the Phantom who then sabotages the next performance.  Under the Phantom's spell and promise of further stardom, Christine accompanies the Phantom to his underground lair.  Christine's boyfriend Raoul (Norman Kerry), finding Christine missing, searches her out along with help from a secret service agent (Gibson Gowland).  Nearly killed, the two rescuers are saved after Christine promises to stay with the Phantom.  Fat chance.  The Phantom ultimately decides he should just escape as hordes of pursuers are closing in.  He grabs Christine and the chase is on until he eventually meets his doom.  The sets and the production values are fabulous.  The acting is pretty much what you expect in these early films.  Lon Chaney is the exception.  His performance is haunting and horrifying.  Tame by modern standards, Chaney as the Phantom terrified audiences of the day when his face was fully exposed.",1355875200,,4083,4.902046783625731

The original The Phantom Of The Opera (1925) is one creepy classic that stars ""the man of a thousand faces"", Lon Chaney.  This movie is creepy from the first frame to the last.  The dark, creepy atmosphere is what makes this movie work.  The highly versatile Lon Chaney turns in another great performance, this time as the phantom.  There have been many remakes done over the years and it's quite a change when going from viewing this silent movie to viewing all the talkies over the years.  Some of the remakes have been good, such as the Hammer version from 1962, but I don't think any can quite compare to the atmosphere of the original.

If you're a Lon Chaney fan, then this is one of his more well known classics.  I highly recommend it.",1354147200,,920,4.493975903614458

3233738,5,B000X7SD6S,"I saw this one on public access TV in junior high, scratchy and jittery, and it inspired me to dress up as the Phantom that Halloween. I can still smell the hot dogs and marshmallows.

Anyhoo, this is Universal's best version, silent, rematsered and in color during the Masque Ball (the Red Death is awesome as well as the name I gave my car). This isn't really a longer version of the film but actually presented at the correct speed per frame.

While not following the novel (none the versions actually have) this is one of the most frightening. Lon Chaney Sr. was the father of Hollwood's FX artistry as well as Universal's first Monster as well as first beloved horror actor.

This is a 1929 re-issue of the first theatrical version (1925) of the Phantom starring Lon Chaney Sr. Here is a list of remakes:

1943: Claude Rains, in full color and more music than horror.

1962: Herbert Lom, a Hammer film with violence and blood.

1983: Maximillian Schell (sp?) and Jane Seymour (gorgeous) in a TV revision that changes names, locale and intent.

1989: Robert Englund and Jill Schoelin (sp?) (gorgeous, too), gory, sexual and even acts as a sequel of sorts.

1998: Julian Sands and Asia Argento (also gorgeous), rats, rape, murder and very dark.

2004: based on the lavish, superior stage play that always bring the Angel of the Night out in me.

There was a TV miniseries with Terry Polo and an animated movie, but I have not seen these two so I'll leave 'em alone.

The Phantom, Erik, represents every artists' hopes and aspirations in a world that does not appreciate them, and explores the ugly (sometimes on the outside, sometimes on the inside) thing that always accompanies great talent. One of my favorite monsters, one of my favorite novels, onw of my favorite plays and one of my favorite soundtracks.

3233742,5,B000X7SD6S,"This review is for the 1997 DVD, which Amazon is advertising as ""The Phantom of the Opera (1929 re-release)."" While the picture quality is not as crisp as the Milestone edition, Gabriel Thibaudeau is hands down the best soundtrack I've seen for this film.  The music perfectly counterpoints the action.  Case in point: For the chandelier sequence, Thibaudeau has soprano Gerda Findeisen sing a lilting aria from Gounod's Faust (1859), who's major key creates an exquisite tension against the mounting suspense.  As the chandelier breaks free, the joyful song turns into a terrifying shriek, which rendered this usually unemotional sequence into a truly gripping and dramatic event.

No other experience of the Phantom has come this close to the emotional engagement of Thibaudeau's score.  Thibaudeau uses an entire range of craftmanship, and is not afraid to use silence, and sudden polyphony to clarify cuts, or build incredible suspense.  While most ""silent"" scores feel heavy-handed, overly emotive, and are at the worse, mere filler to keep you from getting too bored, the essence of Charles Van Enger exquisite imagery is trully expressed through Thibaudeau's score.

In my opinion, the only Phantom worth showing to a first-time audience.",1334707200,,1245,5.321428571428571
3233743,4,B000X7SD6S,This new Blu-ray version of the 1929 PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is the best-looking yet. All previous DVDs pale in comparison. Arrived in great shape.,1331856000,,144,4.8
3233744,5,B000X7SD6S,"As a long-time ""Phantom"" fan (for almost 50 years and the Chaney is the best film version of the novel), I thought the 2-DVD Milestone set would be the last word. And in some ways it is. As some people don't know, Blu-Ray can only bring HD to films that that are in or close to pristine condition. Unfortunately, the original negatives of this great film have long been lost. The 1929 reissue had different cuts from the original but this Blu-Ray does make them more clear. It does nothing with the original 1925 print which is also slightly blurred as it is a copy from the period that also suffered much wear. If you have the 2-DVD Milestone set from 2003, keep it because not all of the extras are transferred but I do recommend adding this Blu-ray for the 1929 reissue.

For once, the newly-commissioned scores are overall quite good as is the Cater organ score. The Alloy Orchestra is the better of the two but it would have benefited from a speed of 20 frames per second. The Thibaudeau score is mated to a less-good print and uses a soprano whose parts could well have been omitted as they add nothing but this isn't a vocal review so I'll refrain. The only problem is that had the Alloy Orchestra musicians looked at the FAUST score, it would've been better. For instance, using the jewel song music for the finale made little sense especially when something else had to be improvised when the actual jewel song was needed. Frederick Hodges' piano score for the 1925 version is also quite good.

By the way, this version of the novel is far superior to the Webber film or any of the subsequent ""Phantom"" films, most of which use the title then make up their own story. For instance, the phantom's face wasn't burned with acid or fire. He was born that way which makes his character even more understandable. In fairness to the Webber, his musical is the only dramatization, aside from the 1925, to make that point. Just too bad the film of the musical wasn't better.

It's time Amazon did an edit job and remove any reviews that don't address this specific Blu-ray edition as some older transfers weren't very good and to include them in the review pot is unfair to buyers and this edition.

 Chaney gave his most iconic portrayal as Erik, the ""phantom""; a character mix of stark terror, hateful vengeance, and touching pathos. The make-up Chaney devised for himself is still brilliantly horrific, and is justifiably regarded as one of the most famous visages in movie history. The film is aptly  melodramatic, the acting  grandiose and stylized as befitting the opera setting. This is often misunderstood by modern viewers, who don't appreciate the unique and complex technique of silent film acting - truly a lost art. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA contains some of the cinema's most famous moments: the climactic  unmasking scene (copied but never equalled), and the collapse of the Opera's chandelier.

 Image's Blu-ray is stunning, edging out everything that we've seen before. Offered here are three versions; two of the '29 re-release taken from 35mm nitrate sources and the original '25 release taken from the only extant 16mm print of lesser quality. The '29 version is presented at 24fps and 20fps, and is quite eye-opening for anyone familiar with PHANTOM. Although there's the expectant wear, the clarity and sharpness is beautiful, with nice, even grain resolution. There are four music scores and extras that include stills, the original trailer, full script, souvenir program, and an interview with Gabriel Thibaudeau, composer of one of the optional scores. His music is magnificent, unleashing all the emotion of this film in a way like never before. The informative commentary is by Jon Mirsalis, also a silent film accompanist and Chaney expert who composed the score for the previous DVD edition of PHANTOM from Milestone.

One is the menu, already discussed in another review, in which you choose the version you want to watch through the orchestral score. So you need the box as a key to inform you which score will give you the 1925, 1929 (20fps) or 1929 (24fps) versions. A strange way to set-up a menu indeed. The more disturbing aspect of the DVD is that during the transfer there appears to be hairs in the film gate, at least in the 1929 (20fps) version. (Haven't watched the other two versions yet).  It seems strange to me that they would go through the trouble to get the best possible 35mm nitrate print, produce a blu ray edition, make it seem like it is going to be the ultimate Phantom and then let the transfer be marred by hairs floating about the image. Watching the DVD gave me an urge to blow the hairs out of the film gate.",1320710400,,968,4.2896174863387975

Instead, there are options to play the film with various and sundry musical scores.  When you DO choose a score, it's pure Hell getting back to the main menu!  Try it yourself, it's quite a puzzle.  I would explain how I figured it out, but it would take too long to go into here.

Anyway, other than the goofy authoring, it's a great release.  Maybe they'll reissue this one day with choices for the various versions of the films presented on the main menu.

I just received a replacement Blu-ray sent from Image and although the menu is easier to access-- for example the version listed as 20 fps Gabriel Thibaudeau score and the 1929 24 fps version with the Gaylord Carter score, etc. the menu is the only upgrade. The momentary ""freeze"" moments which is in the first release on the 20 fps version are, sadly, still there. From what I can tell, only the menus were made better, which is both good and bad. It is nice the menu is easier to access for people who buy this new version but sad that the 20 fps movie still has several moments where for a split second the image freezes. Why they left that the same I have no idea. Okay, back to my original review in early November:

I just finished watching one of three versions available on ""The Phantom of the Opera"" Blu-ray starring Lon Chaney and since then I have checked out the other two versions. First I watched the 20 fps (frames per second) version because I love Gabriel Thibaudeau's score. I was blown away by how sharp the picture looked. I definitely picked up on details I had not noticed before. When the Phantom is in the water, for instance, you can see just how wet the coat is when he climbs back out and details on his face as well. There is also no motion blur as there was on the Milestone release. The one quibble I do have is that there are a few instances in which the movie freezes for a second and then continues running. One place this happens is when Christine jumps up from the couch in the Phantom's cellar. There is a momentary freeze and then also when she wakes up in the morning. It wasn't in Image's DVD release but this appears to be a different print. I have read another writer's review about this problem and he made note of it too. He says the producer of the Blu-ray, David Shepard, is aware of a few of the issues and there apparently will be a second pressing of this Blu-ray with the issues corrected. That is good news. The Alloy Orchestra version, the 24 fps version, did not have the freeze moments. The image details makes this Blu-ray well worth owning. Also, you choose the three versions based on the score. I know that is odd but you choose the Thibaudeau listing on the menu for the 29 version, at 20 fps, and then you choose the Alloy Orchestra Score for the 24 fps 1929 version and you can choose the Gaylord Carter score instead if you wish as it pops up and gives you the choice. The Jon Mirsalis commentary is on the Thibaudeau version and is interesting. Finally, you can choose the 1925 Phantom version by choosing the Frederick Hodges score. Although this is a bit different way to choose, I did not find it complicated. The Bonus features include a Phantom Trailer and the Thibauddeau interview, which was interesting. Also included are reproduction program photos as well as the shooting script on screen. I understand Milestone will release a version next year which will include the Carla Laemle interview from their DVD release a few years ago and a few other items. In the meantime, I am fully happy I purchased this. The Phantom, believe me, has never looked better and again, there is no motion blur. This is a Sweet release. I highly recommend it if you love Chaney and/or the Phantom. One thing I should add is that you get the proper aspect ratio. If you have a widescreen TV it is displayed in a square fashion as the movie was originally presented. If you own the ""Wizard of Oz"" on Blu-ray, it is identical in the way it is presented. It is so cool to see the Phantom in HD! Purchase this one today. You will be glad you did.",1320105600,,3617,4.398507462686567
3233752,5,B000X7SD6S,"This Phantom of the Opera shows its age, to be sure, but it has held up surprisingly well. While co-stars Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry hardly set the screen on fire (as commentator Jon Mirsalis notes), an evocative and then-gargantuan production design, as well as Chaney's commanding performance more than make up for the lack of chemistry between the supposed romantic duo. What is so fascinating about this film is that Chaney is really not all that present and yet his presence looms over the entire film in a menacing way. For the first half hour or so, he's only seen sparingly, and then only in shadow or silhouette, making the iconic unmasking of him in the bowels beneath the Paris Opera all the more dramatic. Director Rupert Julian (aided by an uncredited Edward Sedwick and even Chaney himself for reshoots Laemmle ordered both for the 1925 and rejiggered 1929-30 versions) keeps things moving fairly briskly, though truth be told the original 1925 version can be a somewhat slow slog at times, despite its more coherent and cohesive storyline. The special effects are really quite convincing considering the age of the film, and Chaney's makeup certainly still retains its horrific nature and certainly is still easily one of the most disturbing transformations in the annals of film, silent or otherwise.

The Phantom of the Opera is presented on Blu-ray with an AVC codec. The 24fps 1929 version is offered in 1080p in a 1.2:1 aspect ratio. The 20fps 1929 version is presented in 1080i in a 1.2:1 aspect ratio. (I have emails and phone calls into various sources to find out if the interlaced presentation of this version is one of the technical issues with the first pressing of the BD which David Shepard has mentioned publicly). The 1925 version of the film is presented in 480p standard definition in an aspect ratio of 1.37:1. The press releases accompanying this release are a tad confusing. While there's no question that the 24fps 1929 version was sourced from a 35mm negative, some press releases make it seem like the 20fps version was sourced from either the same negative (which doesn't seem technically possible, frankly, considering the different frame rates) or another one, but there is no question that the 20fps version comes from a different, and decidedly inferior source element, than the 24fps version. The good news is that the 24fps 1929 version is going to be a minor (perhaps even a major) revelation to those who have grown up with inferior 16mm transfers of this film. The transfer is surprisingly damage free. The two strip Technicolor Bal Masque sequence looks great,with the reds popping magnificently. Several other sequences have been hand colored to recreate the original Handschiegl Color Process. The 24fps version offers superior clarity and sharpness, within reasonable expectations. The 20fps 1929 version is a rather major step downward in quality, at least in terms of damage. This version has considerably more wear and tear, with many more scratches, flecks and specks dotting the image with fair regularity. It still has some nicely sharp moments and those who prefer 20fps for their silents will most likely not be too disappointed. The 1925 version, in standard def and sourced from a 16mm print, is obviously the worst looking of the bunch. The image is often quite fuzzy and some of the inserts, as in the letters which are seen in close-up,are quite poor.

The cliff note version of the movie Erik the Phantom of the Opera kidnaps Christine Daa; the opera singer he is in love with. He takes her to his underground lair to be with him forever. Christine unmasks the Phantom and sees his horrible face. Raoul and Ledoux chase after the Phantom and rescues Christine. The Phantom is chase by a mob to the Seine where he is beaten and thrown in the river.

My main comments are about this DVD. This DVD version seems to be the 1930 International re-issue version. The 1930 version is a sound version with a musical score, but still shown in silent version with no one talking with title to explain the moving lips or events. Also there is the Technicolor scene that can be seen in the Bal Masqu segment. This information comes from [...].

This movie version of the book is the most closely accurate. There are a few scenes that are different. In the book the Phantom dies of a broken heart and in the movie he is beaten to death and drowned. In the novel Erik has many trades like: illusionist, magician, ventriloquist, and architect. In the movie version Erik is a self taught musician, an expert in the Black Arts, and an escapee from Devil's Island. Overall this is still a great movie to own and The Phantom of the Opera gets an AAAAA+++++.

3233755,4,B000X7SD6S,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film that is also historically important as an early hollywood horror extravaganza and as Lon Chaney's control over his own makeup.  Though I had seen pictures from this in innumerable monster mags, I had never seen this film.

In terms of drama, as long as you can understand the phantom's obsession with operatic art, it is very fun.  He has fallen for an artist and is promoting her career by his special kind of subterfuge and coercion.  At first, as a voice behind the wall, he seduces the singer by her interest in her career, enticing her away from her fiancee, an aristocratic army officer.  Then, he absconds with her, taking her into his mysterious lair, a medieval torture chamber beneath the Paris Opera, in which almost all of the film takes place.  Snatching off his sinister mask, she understands that he is a deformed monster -  not much nuance here - and wants to escape.  He vows revenge and kidnaps the girl, with her lover giving chase with a mysterious secret cop.  As he terrorizes the girl (the threat of rape is implied), her rescuers are imprisoned in one of his clever traps, though the ""parisian mob"" is in close pursuit, seeking to avenge itself on his many crimes against working men.  THe climax, which I don't want to reveal, is very fun and contains unique details, many of them humorous.

OK, as a silent film, this is not very subtle.  The Phantom is purely evil, if lonely and misunderstood in his obsession with art.  He had long ago escaped from an asylum for the criminally insane.  I was disappointed that there was not more to the character, but Chaney is absolutely fabulous as the deformed and evil genius, melodramatic with all the hyperbolic gestures of silent film.  It would be a later generation that does more nuanced versions of the phantom.

Recommended.  My daughter enjoyed this and is studying the various versions with me.",1300924800,,1911,4.7250755287009065
3233756,1,B000X7SD6S,"In ordering a bunch of different versions of Phantom of the Opera, I came across one labeled very differently from any of the ones I'd encountered before. This DVD is labeled with Nelson Eddy as the actor and 1913 as the date in which it was made. Assuming the seller was simply confused, I decided to get it anyway in the hopes it would be something completely new and different to help me with the project I was working on.

Before I even open the package, I can tell that this DVD's packaging ALONE is so bootleg that it's both hilarious and depressing. There wasn't enough love to even make it look halfway decent. The whole cover is obviously a low-quality printout on regular-grade paper, and it's not even cut evenly to fit the case correctly. The front cover is obviously badly manipulated in photoshop (or possibly even Microsoft paint, it's that bad), and the back cover tells me that this is copyright of ""A2ZCDS.com"", along with what I can only call a ballsy declaration of Federal copyright law forbidding unauthorized reproduction. The blurb on the back is full of unnecessary question marks and an outrageous font, unsuitable for a serious DVD.

Upon opening the case, I find no filler notes or even a scene listing. The case is empty with the exception of one lonely and depressingly bad looking DVD. The graphic is badly centered on the disk, everything is pink, and the entire print job is streaky. I'm dubious to put this disk in my DVD player because I doubt whether it will even work, so I try it in my computer. The title menu loads, and it's shivering and shaking like a chihuahua with pneumonia. It gives me the following options: Play Movie, Scenes, Other Titles, and Introduction.

I decide to check out the extra features first. Both ""Other Titles"" and ""Introduction"" are adds for this ""A2ZCDS"" company, boasting how they have lots of ""Timeless Classics"", and they begin naming off actors and titles from the early movie days. I try watching the movie to find, to my amusement, that is in fact the Lon Chaney 1925 silent film version, which in no way lives up to the original description telling me that this was Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster in 1913. The film quality is even more revolting than it usually is for this 1925 film, as it is pixelated and the screen continues to jiggle as if that aforementioned sick chihuahua were now having a seizure. I didn't bother to watch all the way through the film.

3233759,4,B000X7SD6S,"Is it possible that the new owners of the Paris Opera House were more easily given said ownership due to the belief of a phantom that lurks within the house's walls? Who sometimes sits alone in a balcony seat to watch the production at hand, only to disappear without a trace when the possibility of someone seeing its face arises? Who is writing threatening letters to the current female star to give up her part to another whom he has fallen in obsessive love for? Who causes a chandelier to drop onto the stage and crowd when the threats are ignored? Okay, it's changing from possible to probable, isn't it? It's also probable that you will find appreciation in one or more forms when watching this early Universal classic. The story has taken many directions through the years, but the production values for its time and the presence of Lon Chaney, Sr still give a good argument for being the best version. Not only is this the ""Man of a Thousand Faces""'s most familiar role, but it's also the most familiar physical interpretation of the Phantom after nearly a century of existence. Not my favorite silent horror movie, but it's certainly one that still warrants an encore viewing. Note: There are many different cuts and versions of this film (partially due to its public domain status), so I wanted to be more specific about the version I watched. It almost seems to be a hybrid of the '25 and '29 versions, completely silent (one of the '29 versions incorporated sound to almost half the movie), runs 106 minutes (the longest cut that I'm aware of) and the Bal Masque scene is in an early form of Technicolor, although other prints can have several scenes involving color and/or tints. Additionally, the accompanying music seems to be just an album of generic classical music that is repeated throughout the film and has no synchronicity with what is going on in the film, a fact that is more bothersome during the actual opera performance scenes. A version with a music score made specifically for the film is highly recommended. 6.5/10",1287964800,,2045,4.73109243697479

3233762,5,B000X7SD6S,"A MUST for all Phantom of the Opera lovers!  I'd read other reviews comparing the restoration quality of the 1929 version vs. the storyline quality of the 1925 original print and I totally agree that those are each version's strongest point.  However, the rarer 1925 print still looks much better than the inferior copies of the 1929 film that flooded the video market before Milestone thankfully came along with this great DVD set.

Along with extra features of rare footage, interviews, and photos, you can't help but wonder just how much greater this movie would've been under the overall competent direction it deserved instead of that from Rupert Julian. By the way, who was it that probably REALLY directed the unmasking scene? ;-)

Still, accompanied by beautifully eerie sets, shadowy lighting, and new orchestral scores, the timeless, shining jewel here is the incomparible genius Lon Chaney Sr. He IS the Phantom of the Opera; no other film ""Phantom"" has even come CLOSE to faithfully portraying the original character in Leroux's novel.

3233767,5,B000X7SD6S,"For starters, I have only seen the flm proper (1996 Photoplay restoration of the 1929 reissue), and will only limit my review to that.

The film is absolutely PERFECT!!! The greatest of Universal's horror films. The atmosphere, color, performances, and the fact that THIS film inspired ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" and all of the horor films made at the studio made in the 1930's and 40's make this an instant winner. Chaney is wonderful as the title role, and brings more depth to the character than most other performers. While Andrew Lloyd Webber kept the original ending and the emotional side to Erik, this film makes him less tragic, but more pitiful, as the death scene (combined with Carl Davis's wonderful 1996 re-score) makes anyone watching the film feel sorry for him. The way Chaney holds off the crowd with his gestures illustrates this as it perfectly shows that the Phantom knows how to manipulate people, and that he knows full well that he has sacrificed himself for Christine (I heard the 1925 version has a scene afterwards where Christine and Raoul take pity on him, which adds to the effect).

As for the restoration by Kenith Brownlow, many people point out the motion blur and the seemingly poor quality. This is not due to Milestone, as the restoration was made in 1996 (it's on the copyright and IMBd) using a wetplate process which has officially been out of style since the F.W. Murnau Stiftung decided to switch to digital for ""Metropolis"" in 2000. Many wetplate restorations have this problem, but this one happens to have the video transfer problem as well. The motion blur is partly caused by this, but other times, such as when Christine meets Erik and the unmasking, were MADE blurry to tone down the horror to make it palatable for 1925 moviegoers. While this may seem silly today, back then people fainted in this film and a typical horror film today would probably make people have heartattacks and have been banned and destroyed.

As for Carl Davis's music score, that is my favorite part of the entire film. I like to watch the movie JUST for this half the time. His work is wonderful, and even though I have seen another version with a surprisingly appropraite score (for a public domain video) with the actual arias from ""Faust"" dubbed in, this is still superior especially since Davis has been honored internationally for his work on silent film scores. Mary Fabian's sequence is wonderful, especially as the music builds up before the crash since it still follows the theme from the actual aria (as far as I can tell). Surprisingly this is actually one of Davis's more overlooked works with ""The General,"" ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and ""Intolerance"" being more highly praised, which says a lot about the quality for THOSE scores.

Overall, I think anyone interested in owning or even just viewing the silent film version of Gaston Leroux's novel, get the Milestone Collection simply for the Photoplay Production restoraton.

Augmentation: Finally owning this edition of the DVD, I find I was correct in asserting that the Milsetone DVD has nothing to do with the ""problems"" with the blurriness, it is inherit in the restoration. While I have seen a ""cleaner"" looking version, in terms of blurriness, and its from the Eastman negative, the quality of the fotage was still significantly less than this version, due to the decaying of the negative, which is not nearly as prevelent here.

On the DVD itself, GET IT!!!! Although the 1925 version is VERY low in quality, it is so shockingly different, I don't know whether to say it's better, or just different enough to be considered a separate film! I haven't seen all of it in a single sitting (I hate the music, so it really turns me off. If only the Photoplay 1925 restoration made in conjunction with their more well known 1929 was used since it has tinting and Carl Davis's score), but it certainly seems to be just as good, but looser in editing. The soundtrack using the 1929 VitaPhone discs sounds really poor, largely due to the quality of Direct to Disc recordings, but also since it is REALLY slowed down, so I think they should create its own edit instead of editing it into the SILENT restoration. It is nice to know that at least they tried, and Carlotta can finally be heard for the first time. The bonus features are nice, but I have not had time to look at them all, and some seem a little too mundane compared to other bonus features I've seen on other films.

The DVD is the ONLY way to watch this film, so I highly recomend it.",1258588800,,4532,4.721871049304678
3233768,5,B000X7SD6S,"I've been a longstanding fan of `The Phantom of the Opera'.  I've seen the stage play a record ten times, even being privileged enough to see it in Boston twice and once in New York.  I've seen nearly every filmed version (I say nearly because I'm not for certain I've seen every television movie made) and I even really liked the 2004 big screen adaptation despite the fact that the leading man was dreadful.

This is, by far, the best film version.

There is just something about the silent film era that suits a story like `The Phantom of the Opera'.  There is a Victorian anarchy that runs supreme in the air, giving this film a sense of elegant dread; a refined chaos.  The silent era cinema completely captures that, giving an authentic realism to this ghastly tale.

What I love so much about this film is that they really took the time to make Erik (the Phantom) more than just a monster.  I made the statement in my review of the revered 1933 film `King Kong' that they just made a superb monster film with no real emotional connection.  That is not the case with `The Phantom of the Opera'.  Yes, this is a superb monster film, but beyond that, it is a beautiful film about love, loss and the power of loneliness.

Lon Chaney IS the Phantom, with sincere terror and delicious sense of lovelorn absolution.  Chaney transcends the character and gives a richly memorable performance that just illuminates the screen.  Mary Philbin is stunning and very in tune with the sheer trancelike terror her character is experiencing.  I personally loved the light in the eyes of Emmy Rossum in 2004, and may prefer her performance (the ONLY thing she's done right in her career, thanks to that AMAZING voice) but there are not enough good things to say about Philbin.  I also really loved what Norman Kerry did with the stock character of Raoul.  He really gave him a life all his own.

With a beautiful fusion of horror and romance (a sick perverse romance, but romance nonetheless), `The Phantom of the Opera' is a marvelous film.  Restored in 1929 with an orchestral score that adds to the feelings of the opera house, this film is a must see for any fan of the story.  The restoration is not always perfect, but whether your watching scenes in a crisp sepia, murky aqua or splashed over with faded colors, the fact remains that you are watching one of the best films ever filmed; period.",1257811200,,2388,4.563380281690141
3233769,4,B000X7SD6S,"The art of fear is subtle.  It's not about in-your-face blood and guts and severed limbs.  No, the most rarified horror is when the atmosphere of the uncanny slithers on delicate scales and slowly wraps itself around you, squeezing, gently at first, until you can't scream -- or breathe.  You know the feeling: A sudden awareness that what you expected is not what looms on the horizon, blocking the last life-giving light.

Surrender to the velvety, shimmering shadows of this extraordinary masterpieces of terror and dread.  It seeks to embrace your jaded soul.

We all know Gaston Laroux's 1909 story by now  -- after all, it's been filmed three times and is one of the most successful musical adaptations of all time.  But for me, nothing comes close to the original 1925 production starring Lon Chaney in a role that made his grotesque, pathetic Erik an icon of world cinema and of modern culture.  The lovelorn phantom, dweller in the catacombed dungeons beneath Paris, haunts the opera house with murder, mayhem and his seductive, angelic voice that lures and instructs beautiful novice Christine (Mary Philbin) to stardom.  But alas, Christine loves another and plans to elope with him after her next performance. Erik finds out, lures her into his secret lair, removes his mask and reveals his disfigured face to her horror, triggering the wrath of her true love and that of a rabid Parisian mob.

Not long before he died, I spent an afternoon with Allan Dwan, the aged director -- he was a film pioneer who made well over 400 films - recalled how he discovered Lon Chaney.  Dwan said that on the set of one of the silent films he was directing, every day at quitting time he noticed an extra leaving the lot that had an odd look, or limp or some other attention getting gimmick.  Dwan spoke to him and realized it was all the same man, Lon Chaney, in various self-applied disguises.  On the spot, Dwan gave him expanded bit parts and extra screen time until he had larger and larger roles and finally a lead.  Chaney was always grateful for the opportunity lived up to and beyond expectations.  Chaney was a disciplined performer and thought nothing of applying prosthetic appliances that were painful to wear for any length of time.

The new Blu-ray disc of PHANTOM from Image Entertainment includes three versions of the film.  Two 1929 Reissues, one at 24 frames Per Second, a 1.2:1 Aspect Ration with a running time of 78 minutes and a brand new musical score by the Alloy Orchestra plus Gaylord Carter's theater pipe organs score.  The alternate 1929 Reissue at 20 Frames Per Second runs about 92 minutes with a score by Gabriel Thibaudeau featuring soprano Claudine Cote.  There's also fascinating minutia-filled commentary from Dr. John Mirsalis.  Both 1929 versions are in a surprisingly nice hi-def transfer.  There's also the original 1925 version from a 6 Millimeter Source Copy (presented in Standard Definition) with color tints that runs almost two hours and is displayed in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio with an atmospheric piano score by Frederick Hodges.

""Feast your eyes, glut your soul on my accursed ugliness,"" says Erik the Phantom of the Opera as he unmasks his true face.

Chaney's indelible portrait transcended cinema and entered modern culture as an emblem of humanity's damaged soul.  This version is as good as I've seen so far and is one for the digital library.",1257465600,,3394,4.84055459272097

I still can't believe Milestone/Image allowed this to get out the door. The 1929 print is made from the best available 35mm material BUT so much computer noise reduction was used that fast movements appear blurred and jerky. Yes Virginia, there IS such a thing as over-doing the electronic ""cleanup"". It almost makes me motion sick at times to watch it. And that is sad beyond belief. This is easily the best restoration available of the 1929/1930 by a long shot. But what good is that if you almost need Dramamine to watch it?

Another ""almost win"" is the 1925 edition on the second disc. It is only available on 16mm reduction prints sold for home viewing so the picture quality is not even close to the 1929 cut. BUT you get more story detail and more effective film editing (especially in the unmasking scene) than the later version. It does tend to drag in spots though. I can understand Milestone not wanting to pour massive amounts of cash into restoring this 1925 cut, but it would have been so worth it since there are already dozens of versions of the 1929 cut available.

Not only the 1929 version with the score of Carl Davis is available. There is also a reconstruction of the soundtrack of the 1929 speaking version of the movie. Personally I like the silent version with the score from Carl Davis better. And there is the 1925 New York version. Finally there are interviews with people who worked at this movie. So this is a good documentation of this famous movie.

All the strong points of silent cinema are available:
- there is a score specially made for this movie,
- scenes are tinted to indicate place or mood (common practice at that time),
- filmspeed is correct so that you don't have the comedy capers effect,
- there are scenes with the early Techicolor two color system (I think this is the oldest commercially available movie with Technicolor),
- there are hand colored scenes, so you have a red cloack in an otherwise blue tinted frame.

3233777,5,B000X7SD6S,"Carl Laemmle's screen version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (based on the penny-dreadful by Gaston Leroux), is still a fascinating and riveting screen entertainment, despite being re-made several times (including 2 updates from Universal), not to mention Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage musical.

Lon Chaney gives the performance of his career as Erik, the tortured Phantom who roams the sewers and labyrinths of the Paris Opera House. His attentions are piqued by the beautiful young singer Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) though she is already being courted by Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny (Norman Kerry). As passions rise, the young lovers are terrorised by the demonic Phantom as he vows to make Christine his bride...

Lon Chaney turns in a polished performance as Erik (riding high on the success of his legendary turn as Quasimodo in Universal's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME). Mary Philbin's ethereal beauty serves her well as Christine, and Norman Kerry does all he can to overcome the one-dimensional character of Raoul.

The set built for the Paris Opera House was the biggest and most elaborate free-standing set ever assembled for a picture at the time (and still exists, carefully preserved on the Universal backlot). The lavish 'Bal Masque' sequence was shot in the relatively new 2-strip Technicolor process.

The original silent version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA premiered in 1925, but when the advent of sound occurred in 1929, Laemmle released a new print of PHANTOM with the voices dubbed in (sans Lon Chaney) and new ballet and opera sequences inserted. The film was re-edited by Walter Anthony.  The version that most people would have seen is actually a composite of the 1925 and 1929 versions.",1241913600,,1717,5.139784946236559

Two versions are offered of the classic including a restored,practically pristine,tinted edition of the 1929 reissue version(the most widely available version)which features an excellent new Musical score and an optional audio track with synchronized sound.
The second is the VERY rare,original 1925 version offered in a rough,but viewable version in Black and White.

The extras also include good commentary by Scott Macqueen on the film(he also did commentary on the 1943 remake) and script and film comparsions,as well as the original theatrical trailer!

The film itself is somewhat creaky,but is still full of gothic wonder,featuring one of the all time great Horror film performances in the form of the legendary Lon Chaney as the definitive Phantom.
Several unforgettable scenes include the classic unmasking scene,the chandelier scene and the great,technicolor Masque Ball with Chaney arriving as the Red Death.

3233780,5,B000X7SD6S,"I think many Phantom of the Opera fans (myself included) were inspired by the magnificent Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. After seeing the musical, I became obsessed with seeing the Lon Chaney silent film version from 1925.

Over the years, along with many other silent classics,this film has fallen into the public domain, meaning that its copyright has expired. Because of this, many video companies have been able to cheaply re-release the film on VHS and DVD. The problem with these versions is that they tend to have poor picture quality and backround music tacked-on that does not match the film at all.

At last, someone got it right. This two-disc set, released by Milestone, includes both versions of the classic with Lon Chaney in the titular role. Not only does it have the 1929 restored re-release that most people are familiar with, but also the rare 1925 original version with additional scenes that were edited out later. Also, Milestone had a musical score composed especially for the film that adds a new level of excitement to it. This is the proper way to release a silent film and I'm glad some smart movie studios have finally caught on to it. Also, included are a variety of interesting bonus features that accompany the film well.

My only complaint is that the 1925 film, while I can't deny that I am happy they included it, was not restored in the same way that the 1929 version was. Given the fact that the original film is over eighty years old and that the the version on the DVD is based on the only 16 millimeter print available, this is understandable. I feel like a bratty kid for complaining, but don't worry, it is hardly unwatchable because of this.

Overall, this film is still considered to be one of the best adaptations of Gaston Leroux's novel, it is arguably the best performance of Lon Chaney's career. The Milestone edition is probably the best version of the film out there, so I highly recommend it for any Phantom fan.",1234569600,,1961,4.691860465116279
3233781,4,B000X7SD6S,"I find the one problem with this dvd is the color tinting - I understand that it may have been done simply to provide some definition when some of the scenes had too much black in them. It's to be expected in a silent film, but I got spoiled on KINO's new updates on silent films that are always top notch and of excellent quality. Still, that is not to say that this film is lacking. If you like silent films, then you must have this film in your collection. Lon Chaney gives a performance never to be forgotten, and this film hits all the right notes for what you would expect in a silent film. The suspense builds, the score is beautiful, and what I love about the film is it sticks, for the most part, to the original storyline of the book - with the inclusion of Faust and all. The score even goes so far as to include the arias from Faust that were mentioned in the book, which only adds to the acting of this movie. Unfortunately, the female lead (who I have seen in many other movies, where she has done incredibly well) seems to flounder a bit in this role. But if you were to see her in ""The Man Who Laughs"", you would not believe it was the same person.

In short, despite minor flaws, this is a must-see for silent movie buffs and general film buffs alike.",1231718400,,1268,4.1755102040816325

The combination of music, shadows and color tinting of a black & white film work to render any dialogue an impediment to this film.

Lon Chaney's hideous face and his body language are more than enough to keep any viewer on the edge of their seat.  Simply stated, the film is worth watching again and again so as to better understand all the theatrics apart from dialogue that make a film a classic.  Hitchcock realized this as many of his films went minutes without a spoken word.

3233783,4,B000X7SD6S,"I bought this DVD at a Dollar Store on a rack full of Digiview el-cheapo DVDs.  The thought here was that for a single dollar, I couldn't lose.  I don't think I did.

Since this film from 1925 has not been restored, according to what I've read online, anyway, and is available only on a 16mm print at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, you get what you get.  It doesn't look pristine or even of fine quality.  It's definitely watchable, however, and you have to accept that up to now, that's all we can get.  Also, the only thing that comes in this version is the DVD.  NO ads, liner notes, pictures; zippo!  What do you expect for a buck?

A few mentions:
(1) The contrast varies during the film, but it's okay to watch, I guess. Sorry that it's not perfect.
(2) The ""soundtrack"" is not the original-style organ music that would have been heard in a real theater, but rather a repeated classical music track.  After a while, you will get tired of the repetition, although the music itself is fine.  More music segments would have slowed the repetition.
(3) The total time from the opening to the conclusion of the final credits is 1:46:18. Ignore the ""60 minutes"" mentioned on the DVD case.  That is completely wrong!
(4) The Ball scene is in the two-strip Technicolor, while the rest of the film is completely black and white.
(5) When Christine and Rauol are on the Opera house roof, the Phantom is still in black and white.
(6) After the opening titling and cast list, the film begins with the man with the lantern.

I'm just mentioning these items because of some Amazon comments I have read that mention some of these things, or just ignore them. As far as I can tell, this DVD version is the 1925 original.  Besides Lon Chaney, the cast includes Mary Philbin as Christine, and Norman Kerry as Rauol.

It's really hard to get accurate reviews of The Phantom of the Opera on Amazon because most of the comments on the various DVD versions are mostly repeated from the two-DVD set that features the 1925 original AND the 1929 re-worked  re-release.  Amazon needs to keep all of those comments confined to that particular release.  Each release should feature its own unique comments from buyers.  As you look around on Amazon, watch out for this problem.  At least Amazon mentions before each reviewer if that review is pertaining to another DVD version.

I really don't know if there are better looking versions of the 1925 film, since a real restoration apparently hasn't been done yet, and here it is 2008.  Why isn't some outfit doing a restoration?  This is a Hollywood icon from the silent era.  Even Universal hasn't restored this film.  Go figure out these people!

I hope this is a helpful review of a very cheap DVD, which turned out better than I thought it would.",1227398400,,2782,4.558467741935484

In The Phantom of the opera, Lon Chaney donned the mask of the tortured soul Erik, The Phantom. Joining Chaney in the cast was the beautiful young actress Mary Philbin as Christine Daae and Norman Kerry as the handsome Vicomte Raoul de Chagny.
The film was directed by the merely adequate Rupert Julian, who fashioned himself to be a master filmmaker but his unreasoning and demanding nature caused much toil during the making of the film. The Phantom of the Opera was rife with production troubles and conflict between cast and crew. However the end result was nothing short of a masterpiece, despite what critics of the time thought.
The reason for the film becoming an enduring classic was mainly Lon Chaney's performance and his remarkable makeup. Using little more than he could carry in an old tackle box, Chaney conjured a frightening persona. He skillfully created his most famous makeup with a combination of cotton and colodian, false teeth, and chemicals with which he dilated his pupils. Chaney also underwent the discomfort of having wires, which ran along the sides of his nose and were concealed by makeup, pull up his nose revealing his nostrils and giving him the appearance of having a skeletal face. His appearance and his performance would become iconic with filmgoers during the last years of the silent era, and still provides inspiration to many in the film industry today.
When the film was being marketed, Chaney ensured that the public would see no images of him in full makeup. This publicity stunt was extremely effective and when the film was released, audiences flocked to theatres wondering what the enigmatic Chaney would look like in his latest role. But nothing could prepare filmgoers for the shock of The Phantom's unmasking scene, which evoked cries of terror from audience members, who had never seen anything like it before.
The film was adapted from the novel by two screenwriters, Elliot Clawson and Raymond Schrock. The screenplay is just as convoluted as the novel was. This doesn't affect the film's status as a classic or depreciate the overall value of entertainment. In fact, the pulpy story is delightful, even if a bit tame when compared to the standards set by today's horror films.

The story follows Christine Daae, a beautiful young singer at the Grand Paris Opera House, who becomes the obsession of Erik, the masked madman who lives deep in the catacombs beneath the opera house. Erik, who is best known by the title of The Phantom of the Opera or Opera Ghost for short, uses his genius to orchestrate the lives of all who reside in the opera house. When the opera house is sold to two new owners, The Phantom finds that his rules are being broken and he lashes out at those that dare to defy him. But no one can imagine the full wrath and fury of The Phantom, that is, until the appearance of the dashing young Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who begins courting Christine. When The Phantom lures Christine to his cavernous lair, she unmasks him revealing a hideously deformed face. The Phantom becomes distraught, knowing that Christine could never grow to love a creature so monstrous in appearance as himself, and he lets her go. Before releasing her, The Phantom tells Christine that she now belongs to him and he warns her to never again see Raoul. During the celebratory Bal Masque de l'Opera, The Phantom intrudes dressed as The Red Death and he finds Christine and Raoul planning to run away together. The Phantom waits patiently before making his final move. Once again he abducts Christine, claiming that she is his possession. Raoul, panic-stricken, is shown the secret location of The Phantom's lair, but can he outwit... The Phantom of the Opera?

This 2-disc Ultimate Edition DVD is spectacular.
The first disc includes the meticulously restored 1929 version of the film, along with two soundtracks and an audio commentary with film historian Scott MacQueen. The two soundtracks include the Carl Davis orchestral score and the soundtrack of the dubbed 1930 version with dialogue sequences. Also featured on the first disc are an extensive collection of image galleries, audio-only selections of dialogue that is not included in the restored version, and two theatrical trailers.
The second disc includes the 1925 theatrical release of the film, along with a score by Jon Mirsalis, an interview with Carla Laemmle, an extract from the film Midstream, which features a portion of the opera Faust, and an audio-only interview with cinematographer Charles Van Enger.
Though the 1929 version of The Phantom of the opera has been gorgeously restored and color tinted, the 1925 version has not been restored and is scratchy, out of focus, and completely in black and white.
Image Entertainment's Ultimate Edition of The Phantom of the Opera is without doubt the best available DVD edition, however it does not quite live up to the promise of being the Ultimate Edition. Still, it's a must-have for Lon Chaney fans and connoisseurs of classic horror films.

You get terrible visual quality, no score (or worse, a dreadful score composed of random copyright-free music), and missing or disordered footage.

Image's Ultimate Edition of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" on the other hand, contains two versions of the film (the original and the more commonly seen 1929 re-release), appropriate soundtrack options, commentaries, high visual quality (on the restored 1929 version), and beautiful restoration of the famous color sequences.

""On both DVDs, the ""Bal Masque"" scene is shown in two-strip Technicolor, with the color on the Milestone disc looking a little more realistic. Also, in order to duplicate the original film as much as possible, some of the color scenes on the Milestone disc were actually digitally colored (such as the phantom's red cape at the roof of the opera house), because there is no existing color footage for them.""

do you mean for an original film negative or restored print?

This has long been one of my favorite films, but felt as if I had only seen it for the first time after watching the 1929 edition included in this set. The print is beautiful, and the commentary by Scott MacQueen is insightful. The technicolor has been added to the ""Bal Masque"" scene, and there is a gorgeous scene of a red-cloaked Erik poised against an anotherwise blue-tinted background.

3233798,4,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney was the first of the long line of Phantoms and the one against whom all his successors had to be measured...

The story, despite all its alternatives, is the familiar one of the musician avoiding the world because of his disfigurement and retreating to a hideout beneath the Opera House, from where he emerges to terrorize singers and audience alike...

He kidnaps a young girl singer - perhaps to teach her to become a great star; certainly because, in his grotesque and pathetic way, he loves her - and carries her off to a boudoir he has prepared far underground...

There was melodrama in plenty: in the first version, for example, two would-be rescuers found themselves trapped in an uncomfortable mirrored room the Phantom had prepared, where they first got a heat treatment and then were flooded...

But, beyond all the heightened effects, it was the pathos of the Phantom underscoring his lonely menace which gave the character a dimension, and the isolation of the captor and his captive, imprisoned to a literal underworld, which gave the suspense of the whole film its power...",1168387200,,1099,4.89247311827957

3233800,5,B000X7SD6S,"This truly is the ultimate edition of Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera.  The film has quite an involved history that included cuts of the film in search of a final release version.  The 1929 re-release of Phantom is on disc one and it is a magnificent print of the utmost clarity assembled from an original 35mm print with a restored two-strip Technicolor sequence and hand tinting of the Apollo's Lyre scene atop the Paris Opera.  The score by Carl Davis is perfect for the film, capturing the drama of the action.

On disc two is the 1925 release of Phantom that is about 10 minutes longer than the 1929 re-issue.  The missing footage extends existing scenes and provides a little more continuity with the action going on.  There also was a different angle shot of Lon Chaney in the unmasking scene.  There is a better flow to the action in the 1925 version but the print is very grainy and is slightly damaged at points.  The score by Jon Mirsalis is adequate at best and is un-dramatic when the chandelier falls and in the unmasking scene.  Despite this, it is fascinating to compare the 1925 to the 1929 versions.

The bonus features are also highly interesting.  There is a short interview with Carla Laemmle, who was the chief ballerina.  There are also two collections of stills from the San Francisco and Los Angeles initial screenings that represent the original cuts of Phantom that followed the novel by Gaston Leroux more closely, providing the background to the relationship of Christine and Raoul and the rivalry Raoul has with his brother over Christine.  Also in this early version is the ending from the book where Christine kisses Eric, he allows Raoul and Christine to go and dies playing the organ rather than being chased by a mob.  The character of the Persian (who later becomes police inspector Ledoux) is played as the friend of Eric that he is in the novel.  Apparently, early audiences did not want the Phantom to be a sympathetic character so he was transformed into an escaped lunatic.

This collection is a must for anyone who is interested in silent films and in the Phantom of the Opera in particular.",1166054400,,2135,4.683646112600536

The Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite books of all time and I have been disapointed many times by the many attempts film makers have made at bringing this story to the screen. They need to just tell the story the way it was written, because it is flawless the way it is. It does not need Hollywood changing it, trying to make the story more interesting. This film is the closest thing to the real story and Lon Chaney prortrays the Phantom as he really is, A disfigured monster and madman. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the stage version by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the new movie version of it, but nothing compares to the original story. The fact that this is a silent film only adds to the beauty of it. I guess you have to have a thing for movies like this to appreciate it, but I guess I'm one of those people.

3233804,4,B000X7SD6S,"Despite a history of production troubles and extensive re-editing, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925) has survived as a landmark of the silent era  thanks largely to Lon Chaney's classic performance in the title role. It's a stylish melodrama with serial-style thrills and some genuinely horrific moments.  The DVD ""ultimate edition"" features plenty of extras and a memorable Carl Davis score. Remakes come and go, but the original reigns supreme.",1129852800,,446,5.357142857142857
3233805,4,B000X7SD6S,"While I have absolute praise for what is the most comprehensive edition of the original edition of the silent Lon Chaney, Sr. classic, what prevents this edition from being virtually flawless is the actual presentation of the 1929/1930 foreign reissue version, from the finest known surviving print courtesy of The George Eastman House.

Transferring what is essentially a hybrid of silent (approx 18 frames per second) and sound (24 fps) footage from this release at its closest possible silent presentation (except for the sound version chandelier sequence footage featuring Mary Fabian as Carlotta), mastering in Europe's PAL (25 fps) format, and converting it yet again to NTSC (30 fps) for North American Region 1 release makes this presentation very choppy looking.

Film preservationist Scott MacQueen did a fine digital cleanup to remove as much dirt and scratches from the video source provided by Photoplay productions, and the film has a pristine look, but the jerky appearance of the all the multiple frame-rate conversion cannot be saved. Having to match the Vitaphone soundtrack from the lost 24fps sound reissue to this sluggish presentation also affects the pacing. The supplemental sound reissue trailer (with soundtrack intact at proper sound projection speed) is a better indication of what the film should have sounded like. The Art Deco trailer also gives a glimpse of a cut scene as Chaney is first revealed by being brought up by the mechanism moving the mirror of Christine Daae's dressing room, instead of the more suspenseful hand on the shoulder.

In all fairness (and this may upset silent film purists), I believe a 24fps presentation would have been the best way to go.

That aside, the bonus materials make this a fabulous addition for Phantom fans, thanks to an informative audio essay by Mr. MacQueen, who documents the troubled production, the incompetence of 'director' Rupert Julian, and the sole savior of the film, actor/make-up master (and self-director) Lon Chaney.  His body language is what makes the film most powerful, and his use of several variations of masks and facial makeup combined with critical lighting and photography under his direction make Chaney's Phantom one of the most iconic villians/monsters in movie history, while making him (like his other monstrous creations like ""Hunchback""'s Quasimodo) a creature worthy of pity.

Another rarely-seen bonus is the inclusion of a 16mm print of the ""show-at-home"" 1925 general release version, first seen by laserdisc fanatics on Image Entertainment's 1990 double feature laserdisc.  By the time this version of the film had been issued in 1925, it was the third such release for 'Phantom', and the hodgepodge of title cards vary from rewrites and reshoots that occured (the first two premieres were disasters). The 16mm 1925 version features several different (albeit better) takes of shots and additional sequences dropped from the later sound reissue and give a more cohesive story than the version commonly seen today, but its visual quality understandably leaves much to be desired.

Missing pieces of the Phantom's history are filled out in recreations of the first two premiere versions thanks to surviving shooting scripts and still photos.

The 'Ultimate' version of Chaney's Phantom has yet to be satisactorily released, but his package will do very nicely, thank you very much...",1129334400,,3391,5.276437847866419
3233806,5,B000X7SD6S,"The image of Lon Chaney as The Phantom of the Opera is one of those classic screen images, right up there with Karloffs Monster & Lugosis' Dracula, instantly recognisable. I purchased this Milestone 2 DVD release on a whim & have thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite Rupert Julians flawed direction, nothing can diminish the impact of Chaney's performance. As with all great monsters, the sympathy & understanding are with him. According to the excellent commentary by Scott MacQueen, it was rumored that Chaney directed his own scenes, & the performance of Mary Philbin does become remarkably 3 dimensional in their scenes together.

The new score by Carl Davis is a work of pure genius, brilliantly integrating excerpts from Gounods Faust in a tone poem of extreme beauty. The colour restoration is breathtaking, particularly the Lyre of Orpheus scenes. Nothing to complain about....treats all 'round.",1128038400,,897,5.2727272727272725
3233807,5,B000X7SD6S,"There must be two dozen productions of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.  My two favorites are the 1925/1929 Lon Chaney, Sr. silent thriller and the enthralling Joel Schumacher/Andrew Lloyd Webber 2004 opera.  There are a lot of versions of the Chaney masterpiece to buy, including $5 drugstore copies with no music score.  Kino has an outstanding copy, mastered from a 35mm European film archive print with a beautiful orchestra score.  It sells for a reasonable $25. You can't go wrong with it.

But if you want the ultimate copy, and not have to buy a second copy of the film, go with the Milestone Collection double disk for only $25.  You get a Lon Chaney double bill with Milestone-Disk 2 has the unrestored 1925 original.  It runs 107 minutes with a Jon Mirsalis orchestra score.  Disk 1 is the restored 1929 version, with talking sequences that are apparently lost.  But some of the soundtrack exists as a bonus-with Christine and Raoul, not the Phantom.  The 1929 film runs a tighter 95 minutes and offers two very different music scores:  Carl Davis and a stereo orchestra score; and the original 1930 early talkie music score plus audio commentary by film scholar Scott MacQueen.  Other bonuses include an audio chat with cinematographer Charles Van Enger and remembrances by Carla Laemmle.  In any event, if you want to buy the Lon Chaney PHANTOM, by all means get the Milestone Collection double disk.

How does Chaney stack up against Andrew Lloyd Webber?  I love both a lot.  Chaney is a criminally insane escapee from Devil's Island; Lloyd Webber's Phantom is a tragic hero who actually doesn't look that bad without his partial face mask.  Chaney is chilling as he drives his small boat with Christine through the Paris sewers.  By contrast, Lloyd Webber's Phantom is almost a lounge singer when he does the grandly romantic""Music of the Night"" and ""All I Ask of You"".  And the chandelier falls in different places.  (PLOT SPOILER ALERT!)  It falls 1/3 of the way through Chaney's movie and at the Act one finale in the stage production because it takes twenty minutes to pull it back up to the ceiling.  But it falls in a third spot in the movie, and maybe the best spot dramatically.  And the film has a haunting flash-forward that becomes clear and poignant in the last scene.  The Chaney film has a mob chase the Phantom into the Seine to drown.  The 1925 version has a 20 second lovers' embrace epilogue.

Have a great Halloween with the Milestone Collection version of Lon Chaney's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, but you won't go wrong if you pick the Kino version with just the restored 1929 version and an orchestra score and color tints.  Save the swooningly romantic and elegant Lloyd Webber film for Valentine's Day!",1127520000,,2727,4.746808510638298
3233808,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney's silent version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the hallmarks of cinema (say what you will about the movie itself) and probably the strongest reason why the original book managed to survive the ""death"" of Leroux's other works.

The five-star rating above is for the DVD set.  The movie itself (either version that's included here) would rank slightly less due to the less than stellar directing and performances.  Chaney's performance and appearance, however, are still fantastic (and listening to the commentary just increases my admiration for the man), and the set design is absolutely wonderful.

This DVD set is the perfect compilation of the silent ""Phantom""--or at least the best that can be made with the existing materials.  It contains both the 1925 original, general-release version (by far the most fleshed out and faithful), and the 1929 ""silent version"" re-issue (the better presented of the two, including the primitive Technicolor moments that had been originally intended for the film).  They each come with their own soundtracks.  The 1925 version only has one--a servicable enough score by Jon Mirsalis that only lacks the necessary dramatic punch in a few areas (like the un-masking scene).  The 1929 comes with two--a full orchestral score by Carl Davis, and as much of the 1929's ""sound version's"" soundtrack as can be edited to fit the film (the music for which is nice enough, but I could do without the histrionic voices myself).

The extras include an excellent and thoroughly informative commentary by Scott MacQueen, the additional soundtracks from the 1929 ""sound version,"" theatrical trailers, a taped interview with Carla Laemmle, an old audio interview with cinematographer Charles Van Enger, an ""opera extract"" of a sequence from Faust (an interesting diversion, at least), and a large photo gallery that includes stills from the two preview versions of the movie (both containing cut scenes and characters).

This DVD set proves itself to be one of the finest and most complete that can be created for a movie of the silent era.  A must for film buffs, and Phantom ""phans"" who like to have a bit of the Chaney version for their viewing pleasure.",1124668800,,2199,5.06371191135734

3233811,5,B000X7SD6S,"I do not mean to criticize the  most current incarnation to the screen of the Phantom of the Opera but it is my opinion that the original was far superior.

The silent is truly engrossing and atmospheric and does a phenomenal job inspiring both pity and dread.
Unlike today's movies most of the silent films left much to the imagination and the fact that this version was a silent picture allows the viewer the space to dream the way a good piece of fiction does.

The sets are remarkable. The volence seems  mcuh more horrific  than without the  spurting of blood and dismemberment  we find in day's films and the sewers of Paris seem so dankwe can almost feel them.

The center piece of course is Lon Chaney, the man with a thousand faces. Before the days of  fancy computerized special effects  Lon Chaney perfected movie make up and yet though the gruesome  make up he creates for this role his expressive face conveys emotions that many of today's script writers have trouble conveying in words.

We are repulsed by the Phantom and still we feel his isolation and his love for a woman.

When he is pursued as a fiend we find it heartbreaking.

The film is more than just an artifact of history. Even now it is an effective poetic portrayal not only of a disfigured man but of the human condition.

Every love who loves film should enjoy this picture.

Highly recommended.

3233812,5,B000X7SD6S,"After watching the new Phantom of the Opera, and then going back to watching this silent film version for the first time, it made me feel somewhat shocked but relieved that i liked the silent version one much better. Sure, it's a bit too old to be 100% bearable to watch, not to mention that the acting (and the times cringing and horrible music!) is a bit muddled, but i think the best reason to watch the film in general is to see the wonderful and haunting scene when the phantom's mask is revealed. I really almost hid under my blankets because the face was so creepy, haunting, and melancholy to watch! It's truly a classic moment in film history, it's one that's truly memorable, and one which truly makes you feel the heart and soul of the phantom himself. Also, the other classic moment in this film was when the phantom was dressed as the Red Death with his haunting skull face, classic! I just find it unfortunate that every remake of Phantom of the Opera further takes away the haunting and chilling deformity of the phantom's face and replacing it with a more polished looking villian (which has now resorted to an almost handsome and gorgeous looking phantom as it's shown from the 2004 version). Also, the Red Death scene is becoming more and more diminished as it's being replaced with a simple red outfit with a cape! What happened to the real phantom that gives you chills, makes you cringe at his ugliness, and yet makes you sympathize with his sadness? I guess this version is the only one that has and ever will portray the true phantom, and thankfully, this classic silent film still lives on today for us to enjoy, regardless of how outdated it may be.",1118361600,,1674,4.546357615894039

It was directed, acted, and filmed within your own blood and on the stage of your own brain - a closet drama that grows in relevance and power with each passing year.

Most of us who come to see the film for the first time think we already know what Lon Cheney's masterwork of a face looks like.  But we are wrong. Movie stills and photos in books of the history of horror movies almost hide the secret power lurking in that face exactly the way photographs of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa actually obscure what that particular face is all about.  Just as you must fly to Paris and go to the Louvre to behold the true Mona Lisa, so also must you watch Lon Cheney in action.

He is the nightmare figure that haunts us at the bottom of our dreams and through subtlety and crafts perverts our waking hours.  The Opera is real, so also are the dark chambers and haunted halls beneathe the Opera.

Alas, if only Eric could have remained in his fortress of solitude, but no, he had to fall in love with an operatic stand-in named Christine (Mary Philbin)!

His ability to look bizarre and otherworldly is unmatched. His silent scream during the unmasking is an indelible horror image. The Phantom's entrance at the Bal Masque is a true show-stopper!

You miss out so much when you don't get the chance to see the original cut of a movie. Most of the time an editor or a director can achieve an entire change in plot by simply leaving certain snips of the finished cut out of the released cut. This is what makes the Mileston edition of the Phantom of the Opera so precious.

Not only does the DVD come with the 1929 edition of the film that most people can buy on the bargain shelves, but it also includes the very rare original cut of the film (I believe it was made in 1925). This original cut is several minutes longer than the later cut that has become so much more famous, and includes plot developements excluded from the later cut (such as more scenes concerning Roul and his brother, Phillipe, which make their relationship stronger; the original ending to the film; and several scenes that add both mystery and emotion to the character of the phantom himself).

Take the word of some one who grew up believing that the 1929 version was the best version ever produced of this film, there is so much more to offer with this Mileston edition! It is well worth it, and you'll thank yourself for buying this version.",1113609600,,1399,4.3938223938223935
3233816,5,B000X7SD6S,"Carl Laemmle's screen version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (based on the penny-dreadful by Gaston Leroux), is still a fascinating and riveting screen entertainment, despite being re-made several times (including 2 updates from Universal), not to mention Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage musical.

Lon Chaney gives the performance of his career as Erik, the tortured Phantom who roams the sewers and labyrinths of the Paris Opera House.  His attentions are piqued by the beautiful young singer Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) though she is already being courted by Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny (Norman Kerry).  As passions rise, the young lovers are terrorised by the demonic Phantom as he vows to make Christine his bride...

Lon Chaney turns in a polished performance as Erik (riding high on the success of his legendary turn as Quasimodo in Universal's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME).  Mary Philbin's ethereal beauty serves her well as Christine, and Norman Kerry does all he can to overcome the one-dimensional character of Raoul.

The set built for the Paris Opera House was the biggest and most elaborate free-standing set ever assembled for a picture at the time.  The lavish 'Bal Masque' sequence was shot in the relatively new 2-strip Technicolor process.

The original silent version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA premiered in 1925, but when the advent of sound occurred in 1929, Laemmle released a new print of PHANTOM with the voices dubbed in (sans Lon Chaney) and new ballet and opera sequences inserted. The film was re-edited by Walter Anthony.

The version that most people would have seen is actually a composite of the 1925 and 1929 versions.  The print features the tinting (done according to the original 1925 specifications) and the new ballet/opera sequences, with a full orchestral score provided by Gabriel Thibaudoux.  The original 1925 version is rarely-seen because of it's badly deteriorated picture.",1111104000,,1924,5.214285714285714

Thats right, when you see this film, the incredible skull head Lon wears is his creation. The phantom mask he wears over it is another creation of Chaney. It was made to look like painted on dolls eyes, which as scene changed the mask would change. When you see this film, don't see it look for a exact portayal of the book, because its not.

At the same, a beautiful understudy for the opera prima donna had been singing lessons form the mysterious ghost. The ghost then proclaims that the star be replaced by Miss Dae or there will consequences. Of course no listens and the star goes on, but then in a well known moment when the phantom causes the chandlier to fall of from the ceiling of the opera house.

3233818,5,B000X7SD6S,"At a moment when the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera is hitting the screen, some viewers may be interested in taking a look at the movie that started it all. Whether or not this DVD set put out by Milestone is really the ""Ultimate Edition"" Phantom of the Opera I do not claim to know, but it will certainly do until something better comes along. The set consists of a pair of DVDs that offer two versions of the picture. According to the commentary, the 1925 version only survives in a 16mm print held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and this is offered on the second disk.

However, after the arrival of sound, in 1929, Universal decided to put out an ""improved"" reissue of one of its biggest silent hits, with some new footage, and a synchronized music and effects track. Surprisingly, in spite of occasional, rather clumsily interpolated sections of asynchronous dialogue in which voices sometimes supplement the intertitles and sometimes repeat them, the reissue is mainly an improvement. And the Milestone set, by offering both the original release and the reissue, gives viewers a rare opportunity to compare the earlier and later versions of one of most famous American productions of the silent era.

Fortunately, a 35mm copy of the reissue, struck from a negative made in 1930 for the international market, was preserved by the late James Card, the curator of the Eastman House. It is this version, restored by Photoplay Productions, replete with the original tinting and enhanced by restored color sequences, which forms the pice de rsistance of this ""Ultimate"" Phantom of the Opera. The DVD even offers a pair of soundtracks-the original one from 1930 and a fancier stereo one, with music composed by Carl Davis and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic. The picture quality of this version, effectively reproduced by the digital processing, will certainly come as a surprise to anyone who has only seen dupey, third or later generation copies of silent classics like The Phantom of the Opera. Especially worth looking at more than once is the sequence of the masked opera ball. With the color restored, this is clearly one of the high points in the early history of horror films.

It would be misleading to call The Phantom of the Opera a great motion picture. Universal was always a rather tacky studio, and the production values of the movie are inferior to those of pictures being made by MGM and Paramount, although some shots of Erik's subterranean realm have a genuine magic. Moreover, the performers are uniformly mediocre, with one spectacular exception. And Phantom of the Opera remains an impressive viewing experience today just because of that one exception: Lon Chaney's superb interpretation of the role of Erik, the phantom of the title. If Helen of Troy's was the face that launched a thousand ships, Lon Chaney's was the face that launched a hit movie, in addition to a couple of remakes, various Phantom wannabes, and, more recently, the Broadway hit.

The first Phantom was putatively directed by a hack named Rupert Julian, who is otherwise remembered for having finished up Merry Go Round after Universal fired Erich von Stroheim. As Scott MacQueen's excellent commentary to the 1929 reissue makes clear, however, Chaney-who could not stand Julian-must have had a considerable influence upon the finished movie. It is only an exercise in frustration to speculate what might have resulted had Chaney been able to collaborate with the gifted and sympathetic Tod Browning, who had just directed him in the perversely entertaining thriller The Unholy Three.

To present day spectators accustomed to scenes of carnage realistically depicted to the last drop of gore, Chaney's makeup will seem only modestly frightening, but that is hardly the point. Chaney invests his role with a carnal intensity screen performers rarely succeeded in doing after sound came in. A shot of his fingers suspended in midair, tentatively gesticulating before he touches the unwitting Christine carries just as much electricity as the famous moment when she undoes his mask and reveals his mutilated face.

More importantly, Chaney gives us a grandiose Romantic villain cut from the same cloth as Byron's Manfred or Charles Robert Maturin's Melmoth. Erik is a great artist and wounded soul-although the movie, unlike Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, never gets around to explaining why-but also a diabolical madman, who thinks nothing of killing anyone who tries to stand in his way. In a monumental work, The Romantic Agony, Mario Praz showed how this typically Romantic figure filtered into popular literature during the nineteenth century, but Erik was anachronistic in 1910, and even more so in 1925.

The remake with Claude Rains in 1943 already depicted Erik more as a character to be pitied than feared, and the Webber super production turned Leroux's belated, but disturbing Romantic fable into a piece of super slush that might well be titled The Phantom of the Soap Opera. Chaney's genius was to be able to synthesize both sides of Erik's character: he does stir our pity-particularly when a street mob finishes him off at the end-but at the same time he frightens and even repels us. And Chaney stamped his personality on the role as much as Lugosi did on Count Dracula or Karloff on the Frankenstein monster.

This is one of the most outstanding DVD editions of a silent film classic I have ever seen; only some of the Criterion releases can touch it. Apart from the features already mentioned, the set also contains interviews, trailers, and a stills gallery. Now if only TCM would do something comparable for Flesh and the Devil, or Paramount for The Wedding March or The Last Command.",1105920000,,5772,4.992723492723493
3233819,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is the best version of Lon Chaney's The Phantom of the Opera I've seen.  Before the DVD, I'd only viewed a VHS copy which I purchased in the ""ten dollars or less"" bin.  If that is the only way you've seen the movie, you MUST WATCH THE DVD.  For instance, there was considerable use of primitive Technicolor in this film; much of the movie is b&w, but during the masked-ball sequence, the Phantom makes quite an entrance as Red Death.  Some of the color has proven irreparable, but the restorers have digitally colorized some sequences to try to recapture the original feel of the film.

The DVD set includes two discs - the 1925 version and the 1929 version.  To really appreciate the movie, YOU MUST WATCH WITH THE AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK!  We find out all the trouble (and there was a lot of it) that went into this movie.  For instance, the director (Rupert Julien) had no talent!  The studio kept botching the project, which is why there are umpteen different versions.  The commentator points out all of Julien's mistakes and the differences between the different versions.  As originally conceived, the movie was supposed to be ALMOST exactly like the book (which is why the Persian is in it).  Then, the geniuses in the studio wanted it altered and a version was shot which was NOTHING LIKE the book - this version was a comedy about Raoul.  Then, the different versions were pulled together.  The Persian was changed to a police inspector who wears an Astrakhan cap and eye makeup for no reason.  The Rat Catcher is still there, but unexplained.  Tragically, Erik's backstory (as in ALL versions) is ruined: he becomes merely an escapee from Devil's Island.  However, only this version and the Andrew Lloyd Weber version have a Phantom who was born disfigured and not the victim of acid-in-the-face.

What is amazing - listening to the commentary - is just how good the movie turned out to be.  It remained somewhat faithful to the book, retaining the best set pieces - the secret passages, box 5, the underground lake, the lair, the torture chamber, the horse, the masked ball, and (of course) the chandelier.  We are told that the true auteurs of this movie are the set designer and Lon Chaney himself.  This is Chaney's best performance and best makeup.  He really looks like the Phantom is described in the book.  He also designed his own mask with a whisk of linen at the bottom to show when he speaks.  Chaney supposedly directed his sequences himself, which seems likely because they are - by far - the best parts of the film.  Regardless of its shortcomings, the unmasking of the Phantom remains one of the greatest moments in silent cinema.",1103587200,,2661,4.683189655172414

I swear the sets we see for tHe Paris opera house are the same as the ones later used in Tod Browning's Dracula (starring Bela Lugosi). As for the plot very well crafted. acting is very good (though the pretty lady who screams when she first sees the Phantom unmasked is a little too expressive).

Alpha Video's DVD version of this silent classic is of poor quality.  The image quality is poor, it is grainy and scratched.  It lacks contrast and detail.  The film was improperly cropped; consequently some text of the credits and intertitles is not visible.  There are no DVD extras.  There is no logic to the chapter indexes.  The color scenes have faded so much that they appear to be devoid of any color.

Worst of all, the soundtrack is not synchronized to the film!  The Alpha Video DVD version uses public domain classical music, not a score composed for this film.

GREAT DVD with the original release version and then a later restored and semi-colorized version - both contain the hand touched ball sequence.

WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID?  This is possibly the definitive version - the later ones - the Raines and the Lom versions lack the special Chaney quality of Erik ..... immense danger yet compassion.

When watching the movie today - it very much becomes a grotesque ballet.  The performers are choreographed.

DVD contains numerous extras - including sound bites from a later version, interviews - especially interesting is the CARLA LAEMMLE [Uncle Carl's neice]who starred as the prima ballerina in ""Phanton"" - odd when we are shown stills from the dance sequence - a few dancers faces are mutilated - the photograph is specifically damaged ----wonder WHAT they sinned?

Chaney is the master of pantomime - using very small finger gestures in some of the scenes - to convey - it's very much a different style  ...

3233825,4,B000X7SD6S,"The PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with Lon Chaney that most everyone knows is not the original version of the film. It is a 1929 reissue with several changes made to accomodate the addition of sound. Ironic that one of the most famous silent films of all time should be known from a sound version that lost its voice. New footage was shot, characters were changed and most important of all whole scenes were rearranged or eliminated altogether. This makes the storyline much harder to follow and interrupts the flow of the film when compared with the original which sticks much closer to Gaston Leroux's novella except for the rousing chase scene added at the end by the studio (shades of FATAL ATTRACTION!). Now thanks to Milestone/Image with this handsome 2 DVD set you can have both versions and make the comparison for yourself. As the 1929 film is discussed in much greater detail in several other reviews, I shall focus on the original 1925 version.

The biggest problem with it is that it hasn't been restored. Yet. There are reports that a restoration of it is underway along with Chaney's other famous Universal horror, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The problem is that both of these films exist only in 16mm reductions made for the home market back in the 1920's. While the quality will never be that of the 1929 version which exists in 35mm, it is possible as in the case of MERRY-GO-ROUND (which was also directed by Rupert Julian and discussed by me in a review of that film) to significantly improve the picture quality. I shall look forward to that day as I much prefer the 1925 version not only for a clearer storyline and better motivated characters (Raoul and Christine have more depth and Inspector Ledoux of the Secret Police actually makes sense) but for its more expressive title cards and overall pace. While longer than the 1929 reissue it seems shorter due to the way it unfolds drawing the viewer in more. It is a true silent film rather than one reedited for sound.

Until the restored version of the original appears this one will have to do and rates 4 stars instead of 5. Here's a tip to maximize your viewing experience. Decrease the brightness mode on your TV along with the contrast as this reduces the overall stark quality by softening the image. In closing special thanks should be given to Jon C. Mirsalis for creating a fine score to accompany the 1925 version. While not as sumptuous as the Carl Davis score for the other, it does set the mood perfectly.",1091404800,,2483,4.640909090909091
3233826,5,B000X7SD6S,"this was the best phantom movie ever made!!! it also includes the 1925 and '29 versions. the  25 version is a lot better because there are a few more scenes,better unmasking,and better chandalier scene. when i first saw the 29 version [i thought it was from 25 like many people] and i couldn't sleep for two weeks!

i was even afraid to look at chaney's face. for about a year i didn't see his face. but one evening i stumbled upon a vhs with his picture on it. i decided i wouldn't be terrified by an 80 year old movie, so i got a dvd of it from the library [the milestone version with the cover having the picture of mary philbin on the floor, and chaney grinning and pointing] i was instantly mesmorized. with my christmas money i bought the two disc version and i saw the  new york general release version for the first time. there is one problem with this dvd. the los angeles preview version [the one with the original ending and graveyard scenes] was not on one of these disks. neither was the san fransico world premiere version [the one with new ending and comedy relief, chester conklin] on these disks. are these two versions lost or did no one want to restore them. it's just like london after midnight. some idiot collector probably has it and is keeping it to his or her snobby self. but.....

3233827,5,B000X7SD6S,"It is a shame that in the popular imagination the classic 1925 silent version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has been reduced to the scene where Christine (Mary Philbin) unmasks the Phantom and reveals Lon Chaney's stunning make-up job. Because there is much more to this film than that sequence and the camera being out of focus as the Phantom moves towards Christine really bugs me (or was it on purpose?  After all, women might start fainting at a close up in clear focus).  Directed by Rupert Julian, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is an atmospheric horror story and Chaney's performance stands up even given the mannerisms required of actors in the silent era.
The visuals in this film are stunning, from the cavernous world below the Paris Opera house to the Phantom's entrance as the Red Death during the Masqurade Ball (filmed in Technicolor). For me the most memorable moment and Chaney's best scene comes at the end, when the Phantom is able to hold the mob that has hunted him down at bay because of the threat of what he holds in his hand. Then he starts to laugh at the fools, finally opening his hand to show it is empty and giving himself over to the violence of the mob. The scene is not in Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, which relates how the bones of Erik were found years after the events told in this story, but it is a worthy addition to the tale and provides a more dramatic conclusion for movie audiences to enjoy.
In regards to the famous unmasking scene, I do want to add that Rupert Julian's staging of the scene is really as impressive as the make-up, because the audience gets to see the face of the Phantom before Christine is presented with that horrible visage. I have always thought that Chaney's performance was so indelible that it was the reason that the Claude Reins and Herbert Lom remakes concocted an entirely new story, although it does make sense that when you add sound to the Phantom that you would take full advantage of the opera setting. Final note: When I got to see Michael Crawford perform as the Phantom in the Lloyd-Webber musical, I was not surprised that his outfit as the Red Death was clearly modeled on what Chaney wore in this film.",1088467200,,2181,4.532994923857868
3233828,5,B000X7SD6S,"Over the years, I have just about bought every version of the silent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. In my opinion, the Milestone version is THE BEST. The elements have been cleaned up and the image is crisp, clear with good contrast for 90% of the film. This two disc set has both the 1929 and hybrid 1925 original. Actually the film is cleaner and better looking in this version than a lot of the official Universal thirties classic that have come out.
It has an excellent commentary by Scott MacQueen and a real treat is hearing the music originally composed for the sound version accompanying the action from original sound elements.
The Technicolor sequences are the nicest I have seen and through proper use of the colorization process, other scenes originally in color, are presented and match the actual color stuff very well.
This version has been made from the initial Photoplay restoration which also includes Carl Davis' original stereo score for those that must have modern stereo for their films, however, I prefer the mood and music of the original '30 soundtrack.

There is so much to praise in this:
- The settings are marvellous. The gargoyle in the scene on the roof of the opera house, the grandiose opera itself, the parisian streets, and the dungeons!
- Lighting was marvellous: shadows on the walls in the first scene, shadows in the scene with the horse, shadows in the dungeon scenes.
- The characters are marvellous: Christine, Raoul, The Phantom, and a delightfully mysterious character who lurks about. Chaney is fantastic - remember acting had to be bigger in the silents, and emotions had to be conveyed with the body, and this can sometimes look a little stagey - but Chaney is fantastic in my two favourite scenes, the roof of the opera, and the whole closing sequence.
Look out for the unmasking scene, the Bal Masque (especially the scene on the roof) all scenes in the dungeons, for example when two characters set out to look for the Phantom.

3233830,5,B000X7SD6S,"This DVD has restored the original 1925 and 1929 versions of Lon Chaney's incredible performance in ""Phantom Of The Opera"". It's got better sound quality and picture, uses sequences from the Charles Gounod French opera ""Faust"", dialogue and musical soundtrack/score. It's a must have for fans of Lon Chaney and for those who admire the art of early horror in cinema. Lon Chaney was the first, real horror film star. He was known in his day as ""The Man With A Thousand Faces"". His films were tinged with horror, violence (whether external or internal), and heavy tragedy and melancholia. He morphed into different characters by putting on layers and layers of costume and make-up. He could be everything from the tragic murderer-clown in ""Laugh Clown Laugh"" (inspired by the Leoncavallo opera ""I Pagliacci"") the hunchback Quasimodo in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame and in this case the frightening living spectre in Phantom Of The Opera.
The Phantom Of The Opera was first a French novel. By the time of the 1925 and 1929 Lon Chaney film, it was already popular and a familiar story to many. Later, it would enjoy even more success in other film versions and even as a Broadway musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The simple but tragic story involves a pianist/organ player who was scarred for life in a fire in a theatre and forced to live under the new Paris Opera theatre. He has fallen in love with the soprano Christine. But he is feared and hated by those who work in the theatre- the ballerinas, conductor, musicians and singers ( who incidentally are rehearsing for performances of Gounod's Faust, an opera about the man who sold his soul to the Devil and regarded as Gothic and scary in its day) The sheer scale of suspense and horror in the film is tame by today's standards but it was great back then. It really is a film of great art. It would be a perfect addition to you're film collection. If you love Lon Chaney, this film is the one to get. You can always build upon Lon Chaney films since his movies are numerous. Five stars well earned.",1077494400,,2048,4.6291208791208796

But, the ghosting effect on the restored version is simply awful. Folks, there is not a SINGLE clear frame in the whole film! Every frame is a composite of two films frames, and the whole thing makes the film look very clear but very blurred at the same time.
It's an incredible shame that this wasn't handled correctly. There is NO excuse for a film of this high quality to be spoiled by poor transfer to video. None.
But then, some people will watch this and not notice anything wrong. Your mileage may vary.

I had no idea how badly Universal mutilated the film for the 1929 sound re-issue - the version we're all familiar with!  Most of the annoying continuity problems and other flaws, which I had assumed were caused by all the post-production tinkering Phantom went through before its general release, were apparently inflicted on the film at the time of the re-issue.  The 1925 version follows the novel more closely, scenes flow together more naturally, the characters' motivations are far more believable - heck, even the unmasking scene works better!  Despite the less-than pristine visual quality of the source material, the 1925 version in this collection is by far the superior film.
That said, it was still a treat (in a campy kind of way) hearing the original sound track with the 1929 version, and the extra features are plentiful and worthwhile.  Carl Davis brings his usual genius to the party with his score for the restored 1929 version.

3233833,3,B000X7SD6S,"For starters, I agree with all the positive things said about this 2-disc set.
Unfortunately, there a couple of things about the discs that just spoiled the whole experience for me and may do so with you.
First, there is a ""motion blur"" or ""ghosting"" artifact that runs throughout the 1929/30 restoration. It looks similar to what a transfer from PAL video format to NTSC video format looks like only more exaggerated (images appear to be overlapped or double--sometimes triple--exposed). During the unmasking, Chaney's face is unnecessarily blurred, even when using freeze frame and stepping through the scene frame by frame.
Milestone has acknowledged the ""ghosting"", attributing it to adjusting the frame rate of the film during transfer from video master to video master. Incidentally, the original video master was in PAL format and was converted to NTSC for US, but Milestone claims PAL to NTSC was not the cause. Since they performed the additional restoration/picture cleaning on the overly ""ghosted"" transfer, it became a trade-off as to whether to present the cleaned up version or the ""unghosted"" version. Why such extensive restoration was done to a video master with excessive motion blur is beyond me.
For some folks, this will be a minor thing. For others, it will be very distracting and cast a dark cloud over what looks like to be the cleanest `print' of this movie in existence. I will be keeping the other Image DVD edition with the David Shepherd restoration.
Secondly, for the special features, the pause, fast forward, and reverse functions have been disabled. This can be a bit of a nuisance. For example, there is a 21 minute ""restored version"" of the films' original premiere utilizing stills and expository text. This I was excited about. However, unless you are a speed reader, you won't be able to read everything in one viewing. You can't pause it, or ""rewind"" to read what you missed. It is like trying to enjoy a book (both text and pictures) with someone else turning the pages for you. If you miss something, you have to start over from page one and go through again.
Again, some of you won't care about the motion blur one iota. Others will feel as I do: This disc should've been a contender but instead, it feels like a missed opportunity.",1066780800,,2275,4.865979381443299
3233834,5,B000X7SD6S,"Most videotapes, DVDs, and even LaserDiscs are silent prints of the 1929 reissue. Here we finally see the true original 1925 version. The 1925 version only exists in this DVD set and an old LaserDisc from Blackhawk Films. Also, we finally hear the audio for the reissue - the first time for this to be available anywhere.
Disc 1 has the 1930 reissue which has at least one difference from all of the other versions. There is no man with a lantern at the beginning. For me, that was how I used to identify the reissue. The Blackhawk Films and Alpha DVDs (as well as every videotape edition I've seen) have a scene with a man holding a lantern supposedly giving a prologue speech - with no audio track. This scene is not on this DVD from Milestone. This scene is not necessary so we aren't missing much. The box claims this is the 1929 edition. The commentary says this is the 1930 international version, which could explain the difference. Since the commentary is done by a film expert, I tend to trust that source more.
The image quality seems better than any other edition of this movie. The color tinting is nicely done. You have the options to listen to the restored audio of the reissue, a nice score by Carl Davis, or commentary by Scott MacQueen.
It's nice to finally hear the reissue as it was intended. Although it was probably interesting to audiences at the time, it comes across as a bit cheesy. It's almost camp. Most of the spoken dialogue is unnecessary and simply rephrase some of the titles. It almost turns it into a B-movie. It seems no different from all of these other, more recent movies getting updated with CGI effects. Here Universal was trying to cash in on the new technology of ""talkies"" by simply updating a hit movie from a few years earlier.
Disc 1 also has all of the usual extras such as trailers and photo galleries. The photos are not still frames. It is a presentation with each photo appearing on screen for a set time. There are also photo reconstructions of the Los Angeles and San Francisco premier versions. The reconstructions are a series of still images used to show what these versions may have been like. It's not on the same level as the reconstruction of London After Midnight shown on TCM. These are very basic.
Disc 2 has the 1925 domestic, general release version originally shown in New York. (There are three different 1925 editions.) I can only compare this to my Blackhawk Films LaserDisc. Ironicly, this DVD has a man holding a lantern at the beginning after the opening titles. This scene was not on the Blackhawk Films' LaserDisc. However, there are titles for his speech. There are no wonderful prints of the original 1925 edition so this version doesn't have the same sharp image as the prints of the reissue. This is about as good as you're going to see. The 1925 version has more titles and more plot. It does have a longer running time. You're told more about each character, while in 1929, you mainly just got the name and a very brief description. This is the only video edition of the 1925 version with a musical score. (The LaserDisc provided the 1925 print as an extra with no sound.)
The Lon Chaney version of Phantom of the Opera is the only film version to follow the original novel fairly closely. The Persian becomes Ledoux of the Secret Police in this movie, and the ending is very different. There were remakes produced in 1943 with Claude Rains, 1962 with Herbert Lom, 1983 with Maximilian Schell, 1989 with Robert England, 1991 with Charles Dance, and 1999 with Julian Sands.
It's amazing how many times this movie has been remade, but for me, the Lon Chaney version remains the best. This DVD gives you the best presentation of Chaney's version that I have found to date. I would recommend this DVD set to any fan of the story.",1065571200,,3804,4.571010248901904
3233835,4,B000X7SD6S,"Not to repeat another reviewer's long but precise review, I want to add my recommendation of this most recent version of what is arguably Chaney's best work. What many fans don't realize is that the great unmasking scene was also filmed in color and is now missing. Stills of the original 1925 B&W unmasking show it from a slighly different angle. Chaney rejected the color version because the hot lights made the adhesive between his forehead and headpiece start to separate. But, ironically, it is the B&W version of the color footage that survives in both the 1925 and 1929 editions. It is a pity that the missing footage wasn't found fot his restoration. Maybe someday we'll get the version with sound dubbed in (except for Chaney who had died as well as no longer being with Universal). This set could have given us more of that while using the beautifully clear 1929 print. All in all, an excellent effort. If you have the past ones, this is better just as Kino's recent ""Metropolis"" is the one to have. Now it's time to settle back and enjoy the restored ""The Man Who Laughs.""",1064966400,,1083,4.616580310880829
3233836,2,B000X7SD6S,"The Phantom of the Opera is a great movie.  My only bone to pick is the horrendous score in the alpha video edition.  TPotO is a dark tale, it's a horror story for crying out loud and the score is happy, repetitive, and inappropriate.  It sounds as if someone took a greatest classical hits cd and slapped on the movie.  I can't complain too much because of the price, but still someone could have put a little thought and effort into it.  The picture is amazing though.  I enjoy the fullscreen version and the original black and white with the color masquerade scene.
bottom line: great movie, but find the best version.",1064966400,,621,4.5

*** UPDATED DEC-09-2012: ADDED REVIEW OF 1997 IMAGE/BLACKHAWK DVD EDITION ***

*** ORIGINAL REVIEW POSTED SEPT-30-2003: 2003 IMAGE/MILESTONE 2-DISC DVD EDITION ***

I'm lumping my reviews together, just like what Amazon is doing! The above 3 video editions of the Lon Chaney silent classic will be covered in this review. Also, see my video clip at the top of this review to see disc covers, film clip comparisons, etc. (For those who can't see my video clip, especially iOS users who can't see flash video, I posted an external link to the video in the comment section, but you need to go to Amazon's FULL site to see the comment section.)

The 2011 Blu-ray edition of the 1925 Lon Chaney horror classic ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is produced by Blackhawk Films (owned by restorer David Shepard) and distributed by Image Entertainment.  It has no corresponding DVD release.  Blackhawk and Image also released the 1997 DVD edition, and this Blu-ray carries over some of its material.

The initial release of the Blu-ray on Nov 1, 2011 had several manufacturing defects, but a corrected edition was released soon after, and a disc replacement program was set up.  Unfortunately, the replacement program was cancelled in December 2013.  So if you buy used copies from third-party sellers, be sure to ask which version is being sold.

The disc packaging does not indicate which edition is the corrected one.  The only way to identify it is to look at the menu screen.  The corrected disc has a menu that shows more information about the disc's content, while the uncorrected one only shows the score composers' names.  See my video clip above for what they look like.

The Blu-ray comes with 3 versions of the silent classic.  Listed first in the menu, the ""main"" version, as it were, seems to be the 24-frame-per-second, 78-minute version that has the best picture quality of the 3 versions.  Shown in 1080p high-definition, this is, needless to say, the best-looking version of the film ever.  The Technicolor Bal Masque sequence is present as well, as is the re-created hand-tinted red cape of the Phantom at rooftop.  24 fps is, of course, usually the wrong speed for silent films, but it IS the right speed for the 1929 sound version of the film.  And the print used for this Blu-ray (and, in fact, most video editions) happens to have come from the sound version, as indicated by the presence of actress Mary Fabian, a well-known soprano at the time who did her own singing for the sound version but DID NOT appear in the original silent version.  Also, the 24-fps version includes a vintage score accompaniment by Gaylord Carter that was recorded in 1974 at 24-fps speed.  Hence, the 24-fps presentation seems apt here.  Besides the Carter score, a more modern-sounding score by the renowned Alloy Orchestra is also included.

A strange thing occurs during the early ballet sequence: the dancers seem to be moving in slow motion for a few seconds.  My video clip above shows how it looks.  It is present in the corrected Blu-ray release, sadly, as well as the uncorrected one.  The 2003 Milestone DVD does not have this problem.

The 2nd version is presented at silent-film frame rate of 20 fps and runs 92-minute.  Made from the same print that yielded the 24-fps version (slow-motion dancers and all), the 20-fps version is, however, shown in 1080i (interlaced) and curiously has a lot more print damages.  How did the SAME print yield one version with few damages and another with lots of damages?  According to the Blu-ray's producer, the non-standard frame rate of 20 fps made it impossible to present it in 1080p and to apply digital cleanup to eliminate print damages on the picture, as it was done for the 24-fps version.  But for many people, 20fps is the proper speed for the silent version and they would probably wish that the 20-fps version is the cleaned-up version instead.  The 20-fps version is accompanied by Gabriel Thibaudeau's orchestral score (which includes operatic singing), the same score used for the 1997 DVD edition from Blackhawk & Image.  An informative full-length audio commentary track by composer and Lon Chaney expert Jon Mirsalis is also included.

The 3rd version is the original 1925 silent version.  Well, not really.  Original 35mm camera negatives of the silent version no longer survives.  What survive are 16mm prints that were made for private collectors in the 1930s, the so-called ""Show-at-Home"" prints, one of which was used for this Blu-ray.  Shown in 480i, the 16mm picture looks unsurprisingly bad, with murky details and print damages galore.  It doesn't help that Blackhawk/Image chose to use tinting for this version, and the added colors, especially the darker ones, obscure details even more.  The 2003 Milestone DVD, on the other hand, does not have tinting for the 1925 version, and it seems to look better as a result.  The Blu-ray's 1925 version includes piano music accompaniment by Frederick Hodges.

The Blu-ray has other supplements as well.  It carries over portion of the poorly-scanned still gallery from the 1997 DVD, while adding a few more high-quality scans.  Stills that have captions on the 1997 DVD, have none on the Blu-ray.  These stills, about 60 or so, comprise of set construction photos, behind-the-scenes photos, vintage movie posters and lobby cards, and hand-tinted screen captures of a surviving French print.

The film's shooting script and souvenir program are presented as slide-shows of still frames; words are smallish and hard to see even on my 50"" screen.  The script is shown as scans of typewritten pages; each page is only on the screen for a few seconds.  If you pause the screen, the 1080i display may cause text to look slightly garbled due to the interlacing effect.  That's 1080i by nature and that's why this kind of things are better shown in progressive 1080p.  The script identifies itself as ""the fifth revised shooting script circa 1924"", and it contains, like typical shooting scripts, scenes not shown in the final movie, such as Christine and Raoul's wedding at a church.

This Blu-ray is NOT a descendant of the 2003 Milestone DVD, as Blackhawk and Milestone are two different entities.  This Blu-ray is a descendant of the aforementioned 1997 Image/Blackhawk DVD.  The 2003 Milestone DVD is rumored to be succeeded by a Blu-ray edition from Milestone, but no official announcement has been made yet.

*** BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE 2003 MILESTONE DVD EDITION FROM SEPT-30-2003 ***

Although marred by static direction and stilted acting, the 1925 silent film THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is known primarily for the memorable contribution by Lon Chaney as an actor and makeup artist.  His moving portrayal of the disfigured escaped convict who haunts Paris Opera House is perhaps the sole reason to watch this film.  And his talent as a makeup artist helped create one of the most indelible images in film history: the skull-like head of the phantom that conveys sadness, anger, and horror at the same time.  This Region-1-only 2-disc DVD set from The Milestone Company includes two versions of this classic film: the 1925 version that was premiered in New York, and the 1929 re-edited silent version that is most often seen today.  The DVD also contains excellent supplements that give us a good overview of the film's rather remarkable history.

The rarely seen 1925 New York premiere version included on this DVD is untinted, runs 107 minutes, and was transferred from the only surviving 16mm reduction print.  Its video quality is understandably poor; sharpness and clarity are never satisfactory, and blemishes abound.  There are some notable differences between this version and the shorter, 93-min, 1929 re-edited version.  In the 1925 version, actors are introduced via their own title cards.  There is no ""Carlotta's mother"" character.  Carlotta is played by Virginia Pearson in both the opera and the dramatic scenes.  The chandelier sequence is edited more competently and thus played out a little more effectively.  There are more scenes in Christine's dressing room, so adequate suspense is built up before she meets the phantom.  There is also one crucial scene in a garden that explains why Christine is so enamored to the mysterious voice she hears.  In my opinion, the 1925 version is the superior version; it seems more complete and satisfying narratively than the edited 1929 version.

The 1929 edited silent version included on this DVD was transferred from a restored, re-tinted print made by the renowned film restoration company Photoplay Productions.  This is the best-looking version of PHANTOM to date.  It also looks much sharper and cleaner than the 1997 Image DVD.  Both DVDs offer the speed-corrected 1929 version, but the '97 Image DVD opens with a shot of a man holding a lantern walking past the camera, while the Milestone DVD, curiously, omits this so-called ""lantern man"" shot and opens at the opera house.  On both DVDs, the ""Bal Masque"" scene is shown in two-strip Technicolor, with the color on the Milestone disc looking a little more realistic.  Also, in order to duplicate the original film as much as possible, some of the color scenes on the Milestone disc were actually digitally colored (such as the phantom's red cape at the roof of the opera house), because there is no existing color footage for them.  On the '97 Image DVD, no digital coloring was used.

There was a ""talkie"" version of PHANTOM made in 1929, but unfortunately the print of that version was lost.  The dialogs and sound effects recorded for that version, however, survived.  To give the viewer a taste of the sound version, the Milestone DVD offers something interesting to accompany the 1929 silent version: a soundtrack composed of fragments of existing recordings of the sound version pieced together to fit the silent version as much as possible.  The result is still far from being a ""talkie"" track.  It has plenty of sound effects and spoken dialogs, but it has almost no synchronized talking.  Inter-titles are still present (because this is still the silent version).  There is, however, one opera sequence where the singing of actress Mary Fabian (who did her own singing) is perfectly synchronized with the picture, which is a wonder to watch.  The DVD also includes audio-only supplements of recorded dialogs, which give us further glimpses of the talkie version -- and of its rather incompetent voice acting.

Also accompanying the 1929 version is a superb audio commentary by PHANTOM expert Scott MacQueen.  He provides a wealth of information about the production history, the backgrounds of the cast and crew, the various versions of the film, the use of color, and the use of sound.  He deplores the incompetence of director Rupert Julian, and emphasizes that the true auteurs of the film were Chaney and set designer Ben Carr.  He points out that contemporary reviews indicate that the 1925 version contains Technicolor sequences in not only the Bal Masque scene, but also the opera sequences and the auditorium scenes (the extensive use of color must have been quite a spectacle for a silent film back then).  He recounts in great details (while speaking at a pretty fast pace) how the various versions of PHANTOM survived over the years -- the existing 1925 version originated from the so-called ""Show-at-home"" 16mm versions which Universal made for private collectors in the 1930s, while the surviving 1929 version was obtained by a Jim Card at Universal in the 1950s, and the Technicolor sequences was obtained from a 1930 dye transfer copy by restorationist David Shepherd.

To add even more value to an already superb package, the Milestone DVD also includes still-frame reconstructions of the Los Angeles and San Francisco premiere versions of PHANTOM.  These were the very first public showings of the film.  The Los Angeles version ended not with a chase scene as in later versions, but with the phantom dying alone at his piano.",1064880000,,12426,5.127670144063587
3233838,5,B000X7SD6S,"The IMAGE entertainment restoration of the 1929 ""Phantom of the Opera"" starring Lon Chaney is a bit hit. The two-disk set is definately the definitive choice to own by all serious collectors. The clarity is better than any version I've seen to date, and for the first time, the correct running speed has been instituted here. The tradeoff however, is that the motion is somewhat choppy from too few frames. The characters move in proper real-time, and for the first time, you can see naturalistic movement in such scenes as the opening ballet sequence.
True fans need look no further than this two-disk Masterpiece Collection set from IMAGE. This is definately the one to own! The film is tinted and comes in a selection of three seperate sound tracks to choose from: a terrific new orchestrated score, the original sound score from the 30s, and a voice-over commentary track, which is insightful.
The second disk contains the original 1925 film, which few people have ever seen today. The quality is poor, but there are many scenes that are different from the version that we're all familiar with. It's worth watching.
But you cannot beat the restoration of the 1929 version on disk one of this set. It isn't quite the job that KINO put into Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" last year, but is terrific nonetheless. Thank you IMAGE. Great DVD!",1064534400,,1336,4.8384279475982535
3233839,5,B000X7SD6S,"... THE ULTIMATE EDITION 2 DISC SET (Image/Milestone): WOW! I remember watching the restored Metropolis and wondered when someone would ever restore Phantom and Nosferatu as beautifully. Well, they're coming close. This isn't quite the restoration job of Metropolis, but damn, it's gotta be the absolute best that's available. As far as the three DVD's reviewed here, this by far is the best in clarity and dare I say, it's a gorgeous restoration worthy of the most jaded film buff's archive (all that's missing is MAGICIMAGE's Filmbook on the film as a companion piece). The film is tinted throughout, with the addition of the Handschiegl color process during the Apollo scene which I'd never seen before being a nice touch. Steve MacQueen's commentary provided some great insight into the movie's background. The optional score from the 1930 sound release was a welcome bonus track, being reedited to fit this ""remix"" of a film. Thusly, was the best viewing of this movie that I've ever had. The original 1925 version of the film is on disc two and is a bit murky, along the lines of the usual worn out print, but hell, you take what you can get and in this case I'll take it, having never seen THIS version of Phantom before. On my copy, despite the overall clarity of the restored movie ('29), I still noticed those trailing/blurred action lines thingies when a character was moving quickly. It may be a defect in my disc it may not, but everything else in the scenes (and this occured throught), stayed pretty clear, save for the  fast movement. Someone told me that was part of the restoration, which I thought odd, but who knows,I don't see it occuring in the other copies. Hmmm. Outside of that, this is quite the package. If you are serious about having this classic in your film library, this is the best bet. Until someone manages to come up with ALL of the versions, New York, LA, SF Reissue etc all together, then this truly has got to be the ULTIMATE EDITION!",1064188800,,1973,4.685878962536023
3233840,5,B000X7SD6S,"I have loved this movie for 20 years or more. It is my second favorite silent film. I cannot explain my astonishment of seeing this beautiful version on DVD. I have at least 2 other versions of this film on DVD and this is hands down the winner. First off, both the original 1925 version is here, plus the 1929 reissue is here as well. The reissue is far superior than all other versions. Almost pristine except for a couple of minor scratches. Even the scene with Mary Philbin in the custom made bedroom in the phantoms lair, which in all other versions looked like it was on the verge of deterioration is fixed up the best it could be here. Now for the audio. The good news is there are some of the original dialogue segments here on the original 1929 sountrack (though none with Lon Chaney) but they sound a little distorted so you have to listen carefully. They are essential however. Also The Bal Masque scene is the best resoration I have ever seen. Chaneys red cape looks fantastic. Too bad they couldn't locate any additional technicolor scenes (there were other scenes filmed that way, but they seem to be lost). The original 1925 version is here and it is complete but it does however not appear in the best of conditions. But better than nothing. Other than just a couple of seconds, there is no additional Chaney scenes. All in all a must have for your DVD collection.",1064102400,,1380,4.48015873015873
3233841,4,B000X7SD6S,"A bit of a let down after the ALW musical, but a fabulous interpretation! It is very true to the origional book, an aspect which most Phantom movies have lost. Lon Chaney is spectacular as Erik, the escaped madman who longs for the love of Christine Daae, played by a lovely Mary Philbin. I recommend getting the DVD so you can have better sound and visual quality. And yes, it does have that famous unmasking scene which ""made women faint with fright"" when it first came out in theatres.",1060819200,,488,4.49438202247191
3233842,5,B000X7SD6S,The Phantom of the Opera is definitely one of the most well knowm and well done horror movies of all time.  This DVD is no exception.  The movie was made well done and and corected to the right running speed.  There are also editional movie stills that are good to look at. A nice bonus was the original trailer of the movie.  If you are a fan of classic horror movies I couldn't recommend this movie more. Buy it!!!!!,1046217600,,418,4.253164556962025
3233843,5,B000X7SD6S,"There's a couple reviews on here that slam Image Entertainment for its DVD presentation of this Lon Chaney classic, particularly a harsh review entitled ""I hate this Image DVD."" I believe the reviewers who gave it a thumbs down must actually be the producers of inferior DVD/VHSeditions because the special collector's version I now own is spectacuar. Allow me to rebut the negative criticisms. 1. I like the tints. Ths IS the way the movie was originally exhibited and it certainly enhances the film. 2. The Thibaudoux score doesn't stop at all like some reviewers would make you believe. It is continuous throughtout the film and most deinitely increases the suspense. It's a wonderful composition and works great with the movie. 3. One reviewer complained that the black bars on each side of the screen makes him feel like he's watching the movie through a saloon door. Not the case for me. After the first minute, I didn't even realize the bars were there. Just like when I watch a widescreen movie, the black bars in this case don't bother me at all. At least I know I'm seeing the complete image. 4. The action flows smoothly and DOES NOT ""ooze"" aross the screen like molasses in January. I think they person who said that ought to stick with Keystone Kops flicks if that's what he or she is looking for. Overall, I enjoyed this DVD presentation of Phantom tremendously and highly recommend it. The Image version is, by far, the best on the market.",1040342400,,1454,4.705882352941177
3233844,4,B000X7SD6S,"I really remember watching this when I was little. I was a huge shipper of Phantom of the Opera and I had seen the actual musical, but I bought this and I really liked it. Now if I watch it, I do notice the animation is a little bad and it's actually rather strange, I still like it. It gets the basic idea across. Yay.",1039651200,,319,3.923076923076923
3233845,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is the best version of ""The phantom of the opera"" period.  First this is the complete version of the 1929 reissue version. It runs 94 minutes and is played at the correct running speed. The version on IMAGE runs 79 minutes, and also has little tidbits cut out. When I want to see a film, muchless a ""Classic"" film I want it complete! Second this film is shown in B+W. NO TINTS! This movie was filmed in Black and White and that is the way that it should be shown. NO greens,reds, blues, or purples. This DVD also includes the ""ORIGINAL"" technicolor Bal Masque sequence. Third off,no box presentation. Unlike the IMAGE DVD where the film is shown in a boxlike fasion (little bars on all 4 sides of the screen). This version covers the complete screen. There are (unfortunately) no bonus materials included and itwould have been nice to include the original 1925 version which has different footage than the 1929 reissue version which is included here. The price (...) however overcompensates for these little drawbacks. I am so happy to finally get one of my favorite films is this correct and respectful version. Bravo to Alpha Video for getting it right.",1037145600,,1160,4.686274509803922
3233846,3,B000X7SD6S,"(Five stars for the film itself, though.)
When I was a kid I had a VHS copy of this film put out by ""Goodtimes Video"", one of those cheapjack public domain knock-off operations.  There was no tinting, no technicolor, no score... but I loved it.  Every Halloween I'd watch Dracula, Frankenstein, and Phantom before I went trick-or-treating.  So I was eager to see what Image had done in this restored version.
In the opinion of this reviewer, it's bad news all around.
First of all, the Thibaudoux score is far from inspired.  It's generically spooky and has little to do dramatically with what's happening on screen.  There are a few gimmicky exceptions, which can cause much head scratching if you let them.  We can hear the soprano singing, but why not the audience screaming?  We can hear the Phantom playing his organ, but why not characters talking?  Do you see what an aesthetic can of worms this opens up?  And where's Carl Davis when you need him?
The score isn't continuous either.  It seems to have been recorded in hunks and pieces, so every now and then the music just stops - I guess for the orchestra members to toss back a shot of something to help get them through the recording session - and we're left with twenty or thirty seconds of complete silence, oftentimes in the middle of a tense sequence.
Compare this to the score for The Unknown that TCM uses and realize what might have been.
The film is also projected too slow.  Now, I realize that projection speed is a matter of fiery controversy.  If you want to see a real bench-clearing brawl, just walk into a room full of silent film fans and shout ""Metropolis should be played at 18!"", then sit back and watch the carnage as they tear each other to pieces.  But the much vaunted 20 frames a second on this DVD is way too slow for Phantom.  People don't move, they just sort of ooze across the screen like chilled molasses.  Frightened women don't peer around corners, they peeeeeeeerrrr arooouuuund coorrrrneeerrrs.  The unmasking scene has you looking at your watch, when it should be violent. The ballet is slow, the chandelier takes forever to fall; it's just all wrong.  (The final chase seems faster than the rest of the film, thank heaven.)
Silent films were usually projected faster than they were filmed.  Look at the stuff with Snitz Edwards and the ballerinas.  This is silent slapstick, and as Walter Kerr points out in his book The Silent Clowns, silent slapstick absolutely demands the abstractness that sped-up projection imparts.  It requires that the performers be ultra-quick, ultra-light on their feet, and more real than reality.  Sort of comic supermen.  Otherwise their actions don't seem funny, they just seem odd.  And that's just the way it is in this version of Phantom: a bunch of completely ordinary people behaving very strangely.  Imagine Chaplin moving like a normal person and you begin to get the idea of what we've lost here.
And I don't think this is merely a matter of my personal taste.  Back in my editing days I was told that the rule for showing text on the screen was to hold it there long enough that a normal reader can get through it twice.  In Phantom a number of letters from the Phantom to Christine are held up for the viewer to read.  On my old 24 fps tape I could read through the text twice, then just start on a third; on the image version I could read them FOUR TIMES.  This is just too darn long and too darn slow.
Now here's the real kicker.  Image decided in its wisdom to put black bands on all four sides of the screen.
ALL!
FOUR!
SIDES!
So we get a little postage-stamp-sized picture in the middle of a field of black.  It's like watching the action through the door of a speakeasy.
Again, I realize the frames of silents were a bit more square than a TV, but really, how much picture would we lose if it were full-screen?  A hair-thin strip along the top and bottom?  I wouldn't complain, believe me.  If Image gave you an option to view it full-screen, it would be alright, but I can't find this option anywhere in their bare-bones menu.
If the chug along score and tar-like pacing isn't enough to distance you from the action and keep you from getting emotionally involved, this masking should finish the job.
So what I'm saying is I'm disappointed.  Once again purism has diminished a great movie in order to ""save"" it.  If the cheap eighties knock-off is more entertaining than the twenty dollar high-brow edition, there's a problem.
NOTE: Some have said the transfer is out of focus...not so.  There are few times when it is SUPPOSED to be out of focus - the point of view shots of the terrified Christine during the unmasking scene, for instance - but the image is sharp elsewhere.  Occasionally there are hairs and junk at the edge of the frame. The technicolor is kind of faded compared to the pristine Ben Hur, but it's better than nothing.",1035417600,,4882,4.576524741081703
3233847,5,B000X7SD6S,"I thought the use of Switchblade Symphony was a great addition to this already classic horror/romance. Lon Chaney in his own right is a master on the silver screen, whom for his time had no equal. I recomend to watch this moviewith the light off, and some your love next to you.",1034035200,,278,4.365384615384615
3233848,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney's 1925 THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has always been more of a popular than a critical favorite, and this may account for the fact that it has never really been restored and preserved as well as one might hope.  Over the years dozens of companies have released versions of the film on VHS and DVD to the home market, and some have been quite bizarre.  I have encountered more than one video tape release without any score at all; a visually impressive 1993 video release by Video Treasures had an incredibly unsuitable pseudo-rock score by Rick Wakeman of the band Yes; the usually expert Kino actually includes a number of superfluious scenes added in 1929 for a semi-sound re-release.  So any purchase of this film is a very hit or miss affair, and I recommend that you borrow, rent, and seek the advice of friends before you actually purchase any particular copy.

That said, the silent version of THE PHANTOM is very much in the ""grand manner""--which is precisely why audiences love it and critics tend to dismiss it.  Everything about the film is larger than life just a bit campy.  The sets are enormous and frequently bizarre, the costumes are outrageous, and the entire cast plays in a very grand manner: Chaney is very, very broad here, and his make-up is justly famous; Mary Philbin totters improbably with horror in virtually every scene; Arthur Edmund Carewe has some of the weirdest eye make-up you'll ever see on screen.  Chandeliers crash, ballerinas twirl in terror, mirrors open, lakes drain, audiences panic, horses run away with carriages, peasants riot in the street, and there's even (in a good print) a very early color photography sequence.

It is all a TREMENDOUS amount of fun, and while I wouldn't class it with the truly great Chaney films (such as THE UNKNOWN, to name but one) it is still the best film version of the famous story to date.  Of all the films made of the Leroux novel, this one is easily the best--and, interestingly, is really closer to the novel's spirit than later adaptations, which tend to romanticize the Phantom.  A must have for any fan of silent film, and well worth the hunt for a really good print.

3233850,3,B000X7SD6S,"This is a silent movie, and that's both strength and weakness.  The strength is great visuals, from Chaney's superb makeup to the underground lake to the masked ball to the mob pursuit through Paris.  All wonderful.
The weakness is the lack of plot and character development.  The movie starts the story in the middle, and you never learned how Erik became the Phantom, or of his mentor/pupil relationship with Christine and why she went with him into the catacombs.  If you don't already know the story, that part of the film doesn't make sense.  I guess someone decided they couldn't do adequate singing lessons in a silent movie.
Still, I do recommend it.  I just wish they'd done the parts they left out.",1013126400,,708,4.715447154471545
3233851,4,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney is nothing less than spectacular in this original, silent version of the much-remade classic. This is definitely a Phantom with soul, as horrific as Chaney's appearance is. The cinematography, lighting and sets are all eye-popping, and there are dozens of images and scenes that will stay in your memory long after you see them. I did have to subtract one star because sadly, this classic silent has not been restored as well as some others from this time period. Silents are daunting to some people anyway, and unrestored silents are even more work for the viewer. Still and all, until a digitally restored version is made available, this is by far the best version of this seminal horror film you can get, and any serious film or horror collector will have a big hole in their collection 'til they get it!",1013040000,,818,4.7272727272727275
3233852,4,B000X7SD6S,"This title is a good buy for all fans. The correction of adapting to the origianl frame rate of 20fps helps the film not look so ""comical"" or ""Keystone Cops"" like. The movment of characters onscreen actually looks 'natural' for the first time since the film was probably made (although there still are some speeded-up sequences here and there). The score, while not fabulous, works overall and does not distract the viewer at all. This version is color tinted throughout and the ballroom scene has been fully colorized. But you can always switch your DVD player to black and white mode if it bugs you too much. Don't expect any transfer miracles in picture-quality, but it's an improvment over all VHS versions that I've seen. There's a nice ""making-of"" story on the jacket and some behind the scenes images on disk, but no other extras. A commentary would have been nice.

3233854,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney made over 150 films!!  99.9% of which were silent ones.  Chaney was born to deaf parents, which proved to be a great contributing factor to his acting genious of the silent screen!  Father of Lon Chaney Jr. (1941 Wolfman fame).  He died in 1930!
The ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" a nick name he received because of his unbelievable ability to be the master of disguise (both facial and body contortion wise).
This ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1925/this is the 1929 re-released 35mm version) DVD has recaptured the unique splendor of Gaston Leroux's famous novel of the same name and the genius of the Greatest Make-up and Acting genius of the Silent Screen, Lon Chaney.
Perfectly digitally remastered the Full Screen presentation is excellent with the original 2/color Technicolor ""Bal Masque"" scene and Technicolor hues to enhance this visual silent classic.  (Hue examples; Blue - Outside Sequences, Yellow - Inside the Opera House,  Green - Opera House Cellar,  Orange - Phantoms Catacombs, Red - The fire sequences).
A new Sychronized digital stereophonic orchestral score (by Gabriel Thibaudoux), to include operatic voice sequences, enhances the entertainment value of this great story.
Summary:  The masked Phantom (Lon Chaney), Erik horribly disfigured lives in the Catacombs beneath the Opera House in 19th Century Paris.  He falls in love with a young operatic understudy Christine (Mary Philbin a real life ballerina).  Kidnaps and holds her hostage in his Catacomb lair.  Cristene's boyfriend Raoul (Norman Kerry) pursue the Phantom into the dark world below.  The Phantoms famous ""Bal Masque"" and the ""Unmasking"" scenes high-light this Classic Silent Film.
This is considered by Hollywood to be the first great horror film and best of the silent era.
Extras: includes many stills with the construction of the Paris Opera House on Universal's backlot (today it stills stands as Stage 28.  Imagine that!)
The life of Lon Chaney can be enjoyed by the 1957 screen bio film ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" starring James Cagney as Lon. (see my review)
This is the best of Lon Chaney and a the taste of his and Hollywoods genius during the Silent years of Hollywood.  Enjoy!",1007078400,,2177,5.061624649859944
3233855,4,B000X7SD6S,"I viewing a copy of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" I chose the Kino version which had part of the masque colorized.  The edition also had the original trailer and an interview with an editor talking about the film.  Although I did not find that specific version here, the information I learned helped me to appreciate any edition.
First, this movie does not end like the book.  The film was to be extravagant and the entire opera house was built by the studio.  Because of this extravagance, the studio felt that the movie should have a more dramatic ending.  From the interview, I learned that they filmed many different endings and you will see the one they chose.  The chase scene was directed by a director of westerns since he knew how to direct horses.  The final scene also has a bit of improv by Lon Chaney which really seems to work.
This leads me to more on Lon Chaney.  Even with this make-up on and no dialogue (it is a silent movie), he has no problem is showing you all the emotions that his character goes through.  It is not just a monster terrorizing the people of the opera, but is a who really can not help himself.  Even the simplest of gestures speaks volumes from Chaney.
Without sound and buried in makeup, Chaney still presents us with a great movie.  Even though it is a silent film, you will have no trouble in getting involved in this film.",1005523200,,1364,4.416

The last time I saw this old silent classic was on Halloween in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, accompanied by a large and powerful organ. Wow!
Silent movies at their best--and this is surely one of the best--offer a totally different kind of performance, a pantomime closely akin to dance. All you have to do is look at the way Lon Chaney moves about to notice his singular grace. If there were sound, you'd think what a hambone, but in silent form it's quite effective. The thing I like best to fixate upon are his heels--I just love to see how he puts them down and swivels around!
""The Phantom of the Opera"" still can scare you, so make sure you have a strong arm to cling to!",996796800,,874,4.208333333333333
3233857,5,B000X7SD6S,"I saw this movie a long time ago on PBS during the night and i had no idea what to expect. I had not planned to see it but i did. And am i sure glad i did. This is one of the best silent movies i have ever seen and one of the best horror movies i have ever seen and it has made me a fan of Lon Chaney Sr. The story takes place in Paris in the late 19th century and it concerns a young opera singer (Mary Philbin) who is an understudy in the opera she is in and then out of nowhere she hears the voice of a mysterious man in her dressing room who promises to train her and help her so that she may become a great and famous opera singer. She does and in order to have her put in the lead role in the opera the phantom makes threats to the owners, threats which they do not heed and soon after something occurs( i won't spoil) which puts her in the spotlight. Soon after a man named Cagney( Norman Kerry) begins to suspect something and soon after she is kidnapped by the phantom and from then on the plot thickins so i won't say anymore. This is quite an effective melodrama which was adapted from Gaston Leroux's novel and it's one of the most faithful adaptations rightup until the end of the movie. At that point it changes the more subtle and quiet ending of the book to something a lot more bigger but it works. The acting may seem way over the top to audiences today but take into account that actors could not use their voices so they had to be bigger in their acting sometimes with good results and vice versa. And also  this movie has no official soundtrack, it depends on the video. Lon Chaney gives one of his best performances as The Phantom. He manages to be repulsive and sympathetic at the same time. The movie maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout and also watch out for the unmasking of the phantom! And also for a two strip technicolor sequence which was very rare for it's time.",995241600,,1899,4.132432432432433
3233858,4,B000X7SD6S,"First off, this is one of my favorite movies. Years ago, the Blackhawk Films videotape was the first prerecorded tape I ever purchased. I also own two different LaserDiscs of this movie, and I now have the DVD.
Out of all of the movie versions, this one remains the closest to the original 1911 novel. In 1943, they changed things so that Enrique (Erik) gets disfigured by acid. In 1962, the love story between The Phantom and Christine isn't there. In 1982, all of the names were changed for a made for TV movie. In the 80s, there was also an OK animated, made-for-video version. And so on... There are 9 movie versions I know about. I've seen 8 of them. The 9th is a Mexican version that seems to be lost.
Most video releases are of the 1929 reissue of the movie. They added more musical segments, and I think they added a few bits of dialogue too. There appears to be no version of this with the sound in place. The man with the lantern walking around in the beginning is supposed to be giving a little prologue speech. That's why there are no printed titles for him. I don't think this affects the ability to understand the movie.
Now here's what annoyed me about this release. This DVD was released by Image using Blackhawk Films' print. My Image/Blackhawk Films LaserDisc included both the 1929 version (with the Gaylord Carter organ score) and a silent copy of the true 1925 movie on a second disc. The 1925 version doesn't have the man with the lantern at the beginning, and there is a garden scene with Raoul and Christine. It's also a little longer. The 1925 print exists and was used by this same pair of companies. I don't understand why they didn't use that. New music was used for this DVD so they could have just written it for the 1925 version. However, I feel that the 1925 version doesn't get used because it only seems to exist in 16mm. The 1929 edition still exists in 35mm so the image for the DVD can be better. ...but the 1925 edition could have been an ""Extra"" on the DVD like it was for the LaserDisc.
Except for the lack of the true 1925 version, I still find this to be a great DVD and would recommend it.",995155200,,2132,4.35929648241206
3233859,5,B000X7SD6S,"This is by far the most accurate of any of The Phantom films. I hear a lot of people going on and on about how goofy and poorly acted it is, but the fact is that at the time that was how movies were done. You got to take that into account while watching this. You will need to put on some music while watching this. The silence makes it boring after a while, but if you have something on in the background (maybe Webbers POTO) then you'll find it much more entertaining.

3233862,5,B000X7SD6S,"This early ""Phantom of the Opera"" is, in a word, a masterpiece.  None of the other film versions of the story come close to matching this one. It's a top notch production all the way through. As other reviewers have mentioned, the storyline (mostly the ending) of this ""Phantom"" has been altered and ""Hollywood-ized"". It is quite different from both the Gaston Leroux novel and later versions, including the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. However, it does preserve some of the best elements from the book and, on its own, is fantastic.
The costumes and settings were lavish and the other production elements were strong. The Opera Garnier was faithfully reproduced, down to the angels on the roof. Even small details were accounted for: Christine's room in the Phantom's lair, although only visible in a few scenes, was meticulously designed and furnished.
The two most famous scenes of the film--Erik's unmasking and the Technicolor Masked Ball--are still quite impressive. The designers made the most of the early Technicolor by costuming almost all of the Bal Masque guests in shades of green-blue, pink, white and black--colors that worked best with the two strip (red and green-blue) process. Since most of the performers wore masks, the problem of pasty skin tone was also avoided for the most part. The Phantom's appearance as the Red Death was extremely effective. In several shots, while Christine and Raoul fled to the roof, Erik's bright crimson costume was visible at the corners of the screen.
Lon Chaney really gave this film life for me. Unlike his co-star, Mary Philbin (who tended to be a bit melodramatic and overact), Chaney played Erik with controlled energy and intensity. Many of the best, and most chilling moments in the film came not from the major action scenes, or from Chaney's brilliant Phantom maekup, but from Erik's subtle gestures and expressions. For instance, during the Bal Masque, Erik spots Raoul and Christine on the balcony. He slowly clenches his hand into a fist, never once letting his gaze waver. It is only a simple action, but it perfectly conveys Erik's anger and malice.
Even if you are not normally a silent film fan, you'll probably enjoy this one.",982627200,,2196,4.983651226158038
3233863,4,B000X7SD6S,"I had seen this movie only once before - probably 25 years ago, though I've read the book (and, yes, the story has been altered from the book - but not nearly as much as subsequent versions, e.g., Claude Rains's 1943 Phantom, a real travesty for those who believe a movie should bear a decent resemblance to the original novel) and been fascinated with the images of Lon Chaney since I first read FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine in the '60's.
Having seen the negative review here re: the DVD being out of focus, I was a bit hesitant to buy it ... but I'm glad I did, as my DVD looks just fine as far as focus and clarity is concerned. Someday maybe someone will do a masterful digital restoration of this to clean it up and brighten it up in places, but this is still great for a 75-year-old movie that apparently has no original prints surviving (or at least the producers of this version don't claim access to original prints), and via the magic of DVD, you can have it forever (or for as long as DVD players are made).
A few scenes seem ""speeded up"" - e.g., the audience applauding, the conductor's baton waving, the crowd chasing Erik at the end - despite the claim that it was restored at the correct 20 fps speed. The added singing during the opera sequences is nice and unobtrusive, though it's at times funny when the person on the soundtrack is singing but the woman on-screen isn't seemingly saying/singing anything! Either a sync problem, or the ""silent"" actress didn't memorize all the words to the aria. Likewise, the organ music on the soundtrack could be synchronized better to go along with Erik's organ playing. Since they did add the singing, a future reissue could perhaps exhance the soundtrack to Dolby Digital 5.1 and add some unobtrusive but interesting sound effects to give a surround sound theater experience that would heighten the suspense and enjoyment.
The liner notes (the essay on the inside cover) say it was originally a two-hour movie, and though some description is given about how the film was cut and rearranged based on audience reaction to its initial showings, there is no explanation for the missing 25-30 minutes. I would like to know what has been lost or left out.

The movie was easy to follow with the subtitles and the closeups of the notes the Phantom was writing.
A powerful performance by Lon Chaney, and the catacombs below the Paris Opera House were indeed spooky and helped to make the later half of the movie that much more suspenseful.
I now have seen all movie versions of this. All of them were good, but not having seen many silent movies, this Phantom of the Opera truly captivated me. It is a shame that Chaney died before his time. I have read he only made one sound picture before his death in 1930. It would have been great had he made this role with sound. Truly haunting!
I would like to see Universal do another remake of Phantom of the Opera using the same style makeup Chaney had and follow the story line closely without adding all the blood and gore of today's flicks.

3233865,3,B000X7SD6S,"By far the best version of the first Phantom is the '98 British Film Institute's. Probably possessing the best orchestral score and certainly having the most striking retouching job to the print, this one far outshines any and all of the others, which are in some cases, complete hatchet jobs.  As for the movie itself, well, how can you classify a film that's so much superior to subsequent versions that it shines? Of course, in the Twenties, Universal had access to huge amounts of cash - hence the construction of that opera house (yes; they actually built it as a set and didn't use something that was already there) as well as a gem in Chaney. The fact that it's a silent picture is no barrier to fear in this. Chaney is creepier before his unmasking scene than during or after it. Philbin and Kerry are excellent foils for him. Interestingly enough, Leroux's unhorrific flavour is drowned out, completely leaving the viewer with an absence of sympathy for the skull-faced ghoul as he gets his head mashed and is thrown in the Seine at the end.  The BFI version is on PAL format, unfortunately, but, having seen half a dozen different companies try to get it right with rereleasing this on video, I have to declare that none of them can touch this one, available from Amazon.co.uk.",975628800,,1287,4.665198237885463

3233877,5,B000X7SD6S,Who was the complete idiot who decided to make this fine classic into farce onstage broadway show. Lon  Chany should come out of his grave and phantom the idiot. I'm sure Burt Lancaster's version is greater than  broadway crap too.,940291200,,231,4.75
3233878,4,B000X7SD6S,"Even though the overdramatic acting is outdated, this film still captivates with its classic storyline and Chaney's makeup. Melodramatic story has acid-scarred-face Erik (Chaney) living underground in Paris  beneath the opera house. He seeks revenge by kidnapping a young female  singer (Mary Philbin) and makes her his protegee. The masked ballroom scene,  one of the first efforts to use technicolor, is kind of spooky, and the  famous ""unmasking scene"" still packs a wallop!",928713600,,477,5.493150684931507

3233880,5,B000X7SD6S,"Lon Chaney Sr., the ""Man of a Thousand Faces"" portrays the role of Erik, the tormented, deformed composer of Gaston Leroux's novel ""Le Fantome de L'Opera.""  This, the first in a long series of movie and theatrical versions of the novel, is by far the best.  This movie is remarkably accurate in it's adaptation of Leroux's plotline.  The set and special effects are amazing, especially when you realize that this movie was made in 1925.  This is a ""must see"" for every fan of the Phantom of the Opera  END",887414400,,505,4.566666666666666

One of my favorite silent films of all time, standout scenes are the long shots of the full opera house and the chase scene underground when Lon Chaney (phantom) is in the water.

8227265,4,B000X7SD6S,"This 1925 black and white silent film, considered one of Lon Chaney's best films, is unfortunately granny and it moves in places very slowly. The Phantom is a deranged man, Erik, with a deformed face, who escaped a lunatic asylum and hides in the bottom of the Paris Opera House where there was once a torcher chamber. He appears from time to time and frightens people. He becomes enchanted by the understudy for the Opera's top role, Christine, and writes a letter insisting that the understudy take the top role in an opera, otherwise he will cause great trouble for the house. The producers do not listen to him and he does damage. He kidnaps Christine and her lover Raoul does what he can to rescue her.",1502668800,,707,4.574803149606299

I will rehash this review because I own all of the classic monster movies such as Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man The streaming ones in HD are top quality. You see every detail including when the Monster throws the lil girl into the lake. I own these movies on DVD, Blu-Ray and now streaming which I enjoy more because I can setup my own monsterthon and do as lil work as possible setting it up.",1486944000,,498,4.544444444444444
