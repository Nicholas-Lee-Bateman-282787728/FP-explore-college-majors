4285203,5,B0047H7Q5O,"Wolverine: Chasing the Phantom was very interesting.
It is well made and informative.
I highly recommend it.
Everyone I have viewed it with agrees!",1320537600,4,147,5.166666666666667
4285204,4,B0047H7Q5O,"Having seen this on OPB, the almost myth-like qualities of this animal reminded me of the stories I grew up with in school. Knowing the facts and seeing the videos here, take away nothing of the mystery. They are an American legend in life and may out live us in the end.",1299196800,3,271,4.230769230769231
4285205,3,B0047H7Q5O,"I know about the X-men character and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of him, but I never really thought about the real animals.  They are rare and difficult to find and videotape.  The doc says it's related to the weasel.  I thought if it's a hostile beast that they would equate it with the Tasmanian devil, but they don't take that route.  Although it's just 30 pounds, a wolverine is willing to fight much larger beasts.  They eat bones of other animals.  The work started by saying a wolverine can climb to the top of a mountain in 90 minutes.  Like pandas, they are difficult to breed in captivity.  Unlike most animals, the fathers may be involved in raising the young.  Many arctic animals are white in order to blend in with the snow.  The work never explained why the wolverine was not also white, or least white during the winter.

The work gives hope as it says that wolverines are being found in states that haven't hosted them in decades.  However, they end starkly by saying the animals depend on snowy mountains, so if global warming destroys snow, the animal may perish as well.

This doc was an eye-opener.  If you like to learn something new each day, then you should peep it.",1297900800,4,1187,4.537735849056604
4285206,5,B0047H7Q5O,"This is a wonderful Blu-ray about wolverines, who are related to weasels, mainly because the people who track them love them so much. We see school children in Alaska who treat them like pets. Wolverines are seldom seen in the wild unless you know how to track them. They can be gentle with people, but will attack a grizzly bear. I have gone backpacking in the Sierra Nevada many times, but have never seen a wolverine. They are amazing animals.",1383436800,2,446,4.5875
4285207,5,B0047H7Q5O,What little I knew about the Wolverine. It was my school mascot. Then to watch this PBS on this animal was an eye opener. These men  that made this doc and the person that raised the pups are amazing people. Five star file I really learned a lot from this film  thanks much L,1382572800,,275,4.074074074074074
4285208,3,B0047H7Q5O,"it really didn't tell much about wolverines, was mostly about how hard they are to find in the wild. I was impressed, however, by the fellow in Haines, Alaska that raised successfully two motherless wolverines, especially given that U.S. zoos had succeeded in keeping only one of eleven newborn alive that year. On the other hand, I was more than a little upset at all the money wasted by 'scientists' spending decades studying wolverines with little to show for it, especially when they had such little success in finding them.",1376956800,,528,4.877777777777778
4285209,5,B0047H7Q5O,"In my mental universe, the wolverine isn't particularly mysterious. We have a number of them at our local zoo, right here in Stockholm. Kids love 'em. They are cute, cuddly and playful. In fact, they are more cool than brown bears. Of course, they are also extremely dangerous...

If you hate wolverines, ""Chasing the Phantom"" is not for you. This is definitely a ""nerd"" show. Apart from a lot of wolverines (what else?), we get to meet a number of human enthusiasts with a perhaps somewhat unhealthy obsession with this particular animal. One of them, Steve Kroschel (who reminds me of the crazy guy from A-Team), even breeds wolverines at his ""wildlife center"". The center also spouts a moose?! The funniest part of the documentary is when Kroschel's ""tame"" wolverines attack his camera equipment! Meanwhile, two other wolverine-bitten explorers search the pristine wilderness of Montana's Glacier National Park for the elusive glutton. One of the boys admits that he wants to *be* a wolverine, and ""bite whomever he wants to bite"". Oookay...

The most fascinating piece of info about the actual wolverines, is that the promiscuous male (who mates with several females) actually returns to all of ""his"" females, helping to rear the young. An interesting family arrangement, and apparently an unexpected one for scientists who until recently assumed that these animals were solitaires, with little or no meaningful interaction between different members of the species.

Definitely a treat if you like out-sized mustelids, and the crazy folk who chase them. Five stars!",1375056000,6,1569,5.1936758893280635
4285210,5,B0047H7Q5O,"This video get you to know the phantom of the Wolverine. This my favorite animal, because it's an animal that isn't understood. And this video helps you understand the Wolverine better.",1366502400,2,185,5.0
4285211,5,B0047H7Q5O,"Nature's Wolverine: Chasing The Phantom is a well presented, entertaining and educational show about the rarely seen but legendary Wolverine, perhaps the most mysterious and misunderstood creature from the frozen north.

The episode is presented in beautiful 1080i HD which really does credit to the scenery, which was shot mostly in Alaska and in Montana's Glacier National Park. The audio quality is as good as the video, being presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. The disc comes in a standard plastic case as with most of the PBS Nature Blu-ray releases so there shouldn't be a worry of scratching the disc when you take it out. There are no extras to talk about but that is par for the course with most releases in this series.

The information includes historical theories about wolverines, modern information from scientists in the field who track wolverines and study their habits, as well as the first person experiences of a scientist who has actually raised a pair of wolverine kits to adulthood. Indeed, the scenes where he is teaching the young wolverines and playing with them are a highlight.

Anyone who loves weasels, as wolverines are in fact a kind of weasel, will love this show as will anyone who simply likes animals and nature. I guarantee that if you watch this you will learn a lot about these amazing creatures and their uncertain future in the age of global warming. It has cute factor and is entertaining and education factor too so I rate it as a great buy, especially as it is usually less than $20 on Amazon.",1362182400,5,1542,4.7894736842105265
4285212,5,B0047H7Q5O,"My introduction to Wolverines came through Doug Chadwick's book ""The Wolverine Way"" which may have inspired this PBS special on Wolverines.  A neighbor who just read the book and viewed the DVD commented that wolverines used to range all of North America, now they are rare and yet un-protected.  The video and book combined may be the first steps in changing their persecuted status, along with your new-found desire for action on their behalf.  One of the most startling findings of the extraordinary research documented here is that Wolverines, like other mammals, are family-oriented.  Read the book, view the video--I can't do them enough justice for making this incredibly elusive species accessible.  With any luck, this kind of information will turn their luck around--their remaining habitats are disconnected,  threatened, and researching them a formidable challenge that you will want to take on.",1362096000,,907,5.352112676056338
4285213,5,B0047H7Q5O,I could watch this DVD numerous times because the narration is entertaining and the film footage is excellent.  Wolverines are wonderful animals that are worth knowing and learning about more.,1360713600,,192,5.4
4285214,5,B0047H7Q5O,"I caught this documentary the other day on PBS.  I hadn't heard very much about wolverines before and had assumed that they were more plentiful then they really are.  I hadn't realized how difficult they are to capture on film or that their numbers are dwindling.  The documentary follows two different groups of naturalists documenting the movements of wolverines and a wildlife filmmaker raising wolverines in captivity on a 60 acre wildlife refuge in Alaska.  The documentary cuts between these three main stories while providing information about the wolverine itself.

I found the documentary very informative and it's inspired me to seek out more information on these fascinating creatures.  My only complaint is the one I have with most episodes of Nature: it's too short!  It's so well done though that I can't bring myself to give it less than 5 stars.  If you're interested in animals and wildlife research, I urge you to check out this all too brief glimpse into one of nature's most elusive creatures.  You won't be disappointed.",1353283200,8,1041,5.005813953488372
4285215,3,B0047H7Q5O,Was a little disappointing but still entertaining. More about the researchers than about the wolverine. I just hope the guy in Alaska shows as much time and dedication to his son as he does the wolverines.,1350950400,,205,4.722222222222222
8418150,5,B0047H7Q5O,"many humans in it,creatures are fantastic!",1523491200,,42,6.166666666666667
8418151,5,B0047H7Q5O,"Wolverines are apparently very fascinating animals as I finally found out while watching this excellent nature DVD. Just watching wolverines run through the deep snow was inspirational. Then there are scenes of Steve Kroschel raising two wolverine kits who were orphaned. They show the kits when they are babies and then when they are more grown up. They are as playful as puppies. I'm not sure how safe it would be to be around them however when they are fully grown.

By watching this DVD I learned that wolverines have a very large territory, 500 square miles. This nature show was also beautifully filmed and at times very funny. I can see why wolverines are so interesting and mysterious. I'm glad someone was brave enough to make this episode of the PBS series.
