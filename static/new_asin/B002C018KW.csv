8362667,4,B002C018KW,"This is an enjoyable and engrossing crime film.  I'm not going into the plot details, as that's pointless - you can look it up on the IMDB [...].  Suffice it to say that there are some unusual nuances, and a cleverly done ending.  The back of the DVD case gives away more of the plot than it should, as is, sadly, often the case (pun intended), but it won't spoil the film for you.
