4699405,5,B005HFI7IU,"An illegal immigrant is raising his son in California, working as a day laborer. He buys a work truck, which is stolen from him. His dream of a better life for him and his boy are in danger unless he can get the truck back. This is a film that portrays a realistic view of life for people living in the U. S. without legal status and the pitfalls of living in a place where you have no legal rights. There is no preachy liberal immigrant-rights content here, but just a dramatic example of what many in this country experience on a daily basis. There is solid acting throughout, as this one is very well-done, and hopefully will find an audience.",1310774400,42,646,4.347107438016529

4699418,5,B005HFI7IU,"In, A better life, Eric Eason based on a story by Roger L. Simon reports that Hispanic communities are dominantly marginalized by being pushed into poverty when stereotyped and criminalized as gang members, Eason explains the struggles Carlos Galindo and his son Luis have in overcoming many racial profiling obstacles daily, Carlos's strategy in doing so is keeping his head down and being invisible, this may not be a preferred way of life but Carlos knows this may keep him from getting pinched by the police, that will deport Carlos and remove him from his son's life. Furthermore, Carlos knows school his son's ticket out of poverty and is vital for his son Luis to stay in school and get a higher education, being that Carlos does not have an education he pushes and reminds Luis to stay focused on what's important. Viewers watched Carlos plead with his son saying, do you want to end up like me. You need money in this world you need to work. And to get yourself an education.

Notably, in the Hispanic communities those that are working towards American citizenship all preach the same speech, for example Carlos's friend Blasco, whom also employees him with his Landscape business, he reminds Carlos that he too can have the American dream and to not give up, by saying, you're not buying a truck, you're buying the American dream. Blasco wants to pass his customers on to Carlos, so he can have his own business as a local Gardener. Unfortunately Carlos's dream for himself has depleted since he was robbed of money and his citizenship when he believed he was paying a lawyer to help him get his papers. Blasco believes getting his own business started will help Carlos regain the hope and dreams by saving money to buy a legitimate lawyer that will help him get his papers, Blasco said, buy my truck so in a few months you have lots of money for a real legit lawyer to be legal. Blasco's persuasion re-constructs Carlos's willingness to save money quickly to buy citizenship, that Carlos becomes desperate to buy the truck and make a living, he takes the bus to a local spot to get work for the day but nothing came through till he got home and his sister was there waiting for him with the money he asked her for to buy the truck. At first he was reluctant to take her money, just in case he gets busted or in trouble and can not pay her back. With much persuasion from his sister to accept the money he finally agrees so he can buy Blanco's truck and lawn mower equipment.

Carlos's dreams are coming back to life, he is imagining all his goals he once had, some are to move so his son will go to a better school and  Carlos will not work Sundays anymore.  He picked up his new partner Santiago a man that previously broke bread with him, trusting this man made him get lax in his mentality the man stole his truck, tools, keys, phone. Finally Luis shows compassion during his father's most desperate time, he sees his Dad passed out from what he believes was a hard days work and takes his shoes off of his sleeping father, and the following morning made him breakfast with coffee, then went with him to find the thief. Jesus another worker from the working crew outside in the alley, took them to South Central to find Santiago, there were signs that said too many Mexicans and not enough bullets. Luis asks his Dad, while waiting for Santiago to arrive at work ""Why do poor people have kids, what is the point, Carlos responds he had him (Luis) to watch him grow up and see him make the right choices. When they confront Santiago and Carlos does not get physical with Santiago, Luis gets mad because it is like he does not get angry enough towards Santiago. He is torn between making his place in the hood and with his father. The problem with being Invisible, keeping his head down and stay quiet, is he cannot get ahead fast enough, and the fear of police profiling.

Racial profiling not only affects illegal immigrants like Carlos, but also their children and their youth that are born here. When Luis was arrested for fighting on school grounds they took him to jail and had him take off his shirt because the cops criminalized him as a local gang member, since they did not believe Luis when he said he did not have any tattoo's. Being accused by the cops is a true reality provided by the School to prison pipeline,",1486684800,,4339,4.515267175572519

(As an educator, I've worked with a couple of families like the one depicted in the past.)  However, this leaves his teenage son to fend for himself in the dangers of the gang infested neighborhood in which they live.

A real eye opener to the inner world of a life that many of us never see at such a personal level. Even though the film was made a few years ago, it put a face on a topic that has been talked about in the news lately by the current Presidential candidates. Might make some think differently about ""the wall"". I know it made me really think about the issue in a different light. The story and the acting is superb!

4699525,5,B005HFI7IU,"A must-see film, and very timely.  We are in very uneasy times in the US and immigration issues are a hot-button for many in this nation. I was struck by how this father experienced so many tough breaks, one after the other, just to care for his boy and make a better life for him. Literally, at one point in the movie I thought of turning it off because I couldn't stand ""one more thing"" to go awry for this man.  Then, about 1 and 1/2 hours into  the movie, he finds a glimpse of grace, in of all places, the deportation prison! The conversation between father and son was gut wrenching. I sobbed.

This is a horribly sad movie.  What's even sadder is that is true to life.  There must be a better way. Let's pray for our nation's leaders--that God gives them wisdom and discernment to steer our country back in the right direction.",1463356800,10,834,4.314102564102564

He did his best, had no papers, no driver's license, and bought a truck, which was stolen from him.  Of course, he got pulled over by a policeman after he retrieved the truck from a chop shop, no title, no drivers license, etc.  He was incarcerated, deported, leaving his 14-year-old son with his sister in LA.  Four months later, he is seen illegally crossing back into the United States, which he refers to as HOME.  This is just another gut wrenching story of the human condition and people just wanting to survive.  This broke my heart and it will yours as well.  Even though illegal immigration is rampant, there is still a story behind each person who comes whether for decent or criminal intent.

But it just shows how much grey there is with the laws and life a a whole. Who wouldn't try to get to a better life!

He gets an opportunity when his boss offers to sell him his work truck and keep the clients. BE YOUR OWN BOSS he tells him. Carlos knows the consequences if he gets caught and that's where the story takes off.

The movie left me feeling emotionally drained, as the hardworking father, who wants to do the right thing faces obstacle after obstacle.

It tells the story of so many individuals who unfortunately, never had the opportunity to come to the United States legally, only to try and give their loved ones a better tomorrow. I realize that this is not the correct way to come into this country and that so many are desperate and willing to risk everything including their lives for their families. But one must also place themselves in their shoes, in order to better understand their situation and reasons for wanting to come here. And yet no one ever stops to think about this because we are already here and nobody really cares! I don't think they should be entitled to any medical attention what so ever! And no food stamps or assistance for that matter! This is burden to our governments budget and if they want to stay then they can't have any of this! The fault is completely their governments!

Struggling so desperately to ensure his education came above all and to instill that honesty and hard work were good things, unfolds a tragedy of yet another part of life, different than, and yet, on the same level most people in the world go through.

The movie catch phrase is that ""Every father wants more for his son.""  And that is what the movie is about.  It presents a father who is a hard working, loving person, who just so happens to be an illegal immigrant.

4699874,4,B005HFI7IU,"Far removed from his role as the gangster mayor of Tijuana in TV's ""Weeds,"" Demian Bichir received a well earned Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Carlos Galindo, an illegal immigrant living in Los Angeles.  Living in a one-bedroom shack with his 14 year old son Luis (Jose Julian), Carlos hopes to provide a better life for his boy.  Making a living as a gardener, Carlos has an opportunity to take over the business from his boss, but must first buy his truck and tools.  Borrowing money from his sister who married a gringo, he makes the purchase.

Shortly thereafter, he hires a helper who had befriended him earlier only to have the helper steal the truck.  Without proper papers or even a driver's license, Carlos must find the truck on his own, with some assistance from Luis.  Directed by Chris Weitz (""About a Boy""), the film doesn't break new ground but certainly amplifies the immigration issue in the U. S.  Bichir is very effective with a wide range of emotion.  His son (a citizen) is teetering on the edge of joining a gang, but is a good kid underneath.  Eventually he sees the strength of his father in a gut wrenching conclusion.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The video is excellent throughout.  In scenes ranging from ocean shots from multi-million dollar homes to dark urban street scenes the picture is consistently clear and sharp.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is grounded in the center channel with surrounds coming into play with some traffic scenes and energetic music.  It is all very clear.",1338336000,,1555,4.711111111111111

4699880,5,B005HFI7IU,"This is one of those movies er sorry `films' that should have reached a much wider audience. It tells the story of an illegal immigrant from Mexico to East L.A. called Carlos Galindo (Demian Bichir), he has sold his labour for a few dollars to give his son the chances that he never had. Only problem is that he is an illegal and so therefore works for a pittance and that means he can only live on the wrong side of town. This means his only son Luis has to go to East Los Angeles High School for Gang members etc.  A place where having `twatoos', (as I call them), is de rigueur. Luis though seems to try to avoid all of that but it is nigh on impossible to not get swept up in that sub culture.

Meanwhile Carlos's boss, who he gardens for, is leaving and offers to sell him his truck and therefore the gardening business. He asks his hard pressed sister for a loan and decides that this is his big chance to really change things through honest hard work. Luis has been spending his time being suspended from school and or watching MTV shoeing programmes of  `cribs' of Gangsta rappers and the juxtaposition with their one bedroom pit could not be more stark. This new venture though seems to make him take note.

This film by director Chris Weitz is an understated gem. He also gets all of his actors to do all of the stunts thus to keep the realism there and avoid stunt doubles. He also does all the stunts first himself to prove they can be done. He takes us on a tour of life as an underclass and how it is such people who are the unseen and unappreciated workers in the background that do so many of the jobs no-one else wants. That is not paraded for anyone though it is simply laid out for you to judge (unlike Loach's `Bread and Roses' for example).

Whilst this is a story of struggle and bad breaks it still maintains a kind of forlorn hope that things can get better and that is one of its main strengths. It is a well made acted and shot piece of cinema and I think deserved a lot more plaudits than it has ever received. Whilst not world cinema it is dealing with global issues, as seen through the microcosm or lens of a father and son and how they cope with the lot that life has dealt the.

4699887,4,B005HFI7IU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Director Chris Weitz, known for his work on the last installment of the 'Twilight' series, here has decided to tackle a more conventional immigration drama. At first glance, 'A Better World' has all the trappings of your typical saga about an undocumented, illegal alien, who struggles to survive economically, while raising a rebellious, teenage son. Thanks to Mexican actor, Demian Bichir (known for his role as Fidel Castro in Soderburgh's 'Che') and an exciting second act twist, 'A Better World' manages to rise above convention, leading us to the rarefied world of compelling drama.

'A Better World' opens slowly as we meet Bichir as Carlos Galindo, the undocumented worker living in a rundown house in Los Angeles, whose son, Luis, has been flirting with gang members at school. Carlos can hardly keep track of Luis, as he's busy slaving away as an assistant landscaper for his boss, who keeps trying to sell him the truck he uses for day to day business. Carlos can be his 'own man' if he purchases the truck but hesitates, as he realizes that he has no driver's license and can be stopped at any time by the police. When his sister convinces him to accept $12,000 which she originally stored away for her children's education, Carlos purchases the truck, and is ready to start a new career as self-employed entrepreneur. He soon finds an assistant to help him in the business, which leads to disastrous consequences.

WARNING--BIG SPOILERS AHEAD! The film suddenly becomes gripping when Carlos' truck is stolen by the assistant and he must go on a journey to recover it. Luis, initially alienated, now joins his father in the search for the truck, and finds himself bonding with the 'old man'. Along the way, Carlos tries to check his son's impulsiveness, by preventing him from administrating a more punishing beating to the assistant, after they discover where he is, and recover the car.

Just as things look like they've gotten much better, the truck is pulled over by the cops and Carlos is arrested by the immigration authorities. Luis initially couldn't understand why Carlos didn't attempt to flee from the police while they were together in the truck, but later accepts the fact that his father consistently feels he must live by a set of high, moral principles.

The setup for Carlos' tender farewell to his son while incarcerated in the Federal lockup, doesn't ring true, as the authorities in reality probably wouldn't have extended the courtesy to the son, to have a last minute tte--tte. Nonetheless, the words of farewell are quite emotional and heartfelt, as the father exhorts the son to live a moral life, unencumbered by avarice and the need to associate with undesirable companions. And Carlos fulfills his promise to Luis to return to the U.S., this time choosing devotion to his family over obeying the law. At film's end, Carlos is seen bravely, but illegally attempting to enter the United States once again.

Birchir is excellent as the frustrated father, who manages to contain his anger, despite all the hard knocks he sustains, along the way. I didn't always understand everything Jos Julin as Luis was saying when he interacts with the gang members, but the young actor is at his best when he communicates the new found respect for his father, after joining him in the quest to find the truck. Most impressive is Dolores Heredia as Carlos' sister, Anita, who exudes boundless integrity in the short scenes she performs in.

'A Better Life' proves that there are illegal immigrants who are good people and are deserving of some kind of amnesty program. Hard core right-wingers may disagree but there should be some kind of policy that sorts out the good from the bad. Not everyone works to perfection in 'A Better Life', particularly the slow-moving exposition of the first Act, but as the story picks up, particularly in the second act, we soon come to realize that 'A Better Life', is deserving of the moniker of compelling drama.",1329004800,,4012,4.891176470588236

This film stands on its own as heart-tugging, honest entertainment, but for educators looking for something like ""The Outsiders"" but with many political and economic complexities expertly woven, you have found a film that will bring your class to tears, and open some minds to the human cost of our brutal system of poverty, vulnerability, choices and the fences that divide.

4699892,4,B005HFI7IU,"A few months back (well, it's been a while now), our local Independent Theater was playing a special showing of `A Better Life' and so my wife and I snuck away from the kids to indulge in one of our favorite pastimes; movies.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I had read good ink on Demian Bichir's performance and so I was excited to see what all the hype was about.

Wow; he was outstanding.

The film centers around an illegal immigrant named Carlos, working as a gardener in LA.  He came to America with his wife and young son hoping to make a better life for them.  Years later, he is raising his now teenage son alone, and his life really isn't that much better.  He works hard, day in and day out, but he isn't making much headway.  When a business opportunity presents itself, Carlos is hesitant to embrace it, but with a push from his sister he takes the leap, hoping that the payoff will be grand.  In the meantime, his son is being persuaded by schoolmates to join a gang, and his growing frustration with his own situation is making him question his own loyalty to his father.

Sadly, `A Better Life' works better on paper than it does on film.  When Bichir is not on the screen, the film falters; especially because the depiction of the gang and Carlos's son's friends are pretty clich&eacute;d and poorly acted.  It takes you out of the gritty realism that Bichir brings to his role and his scenes.  It felt like two separate films conflicting with one another; which is semi-understandable considering that Carlos and his son live in two separate worlds, but the cohesion needed to meld these two worlds together was missing.  Bichir is remarkable though; a slow burning performance that grows in intensity but contains so much subtlety.  His final scene with his son left me a puddle of tears.  It was superbly played and possibly one of the single most moving scenes I've seen in all cinema this year.

I would recommend this film.  It tells a beautiful story of one man's drive to help better his son's life.  It doesn't work as a whole as well as I wanted it to, for it does in moments seem too simply crafted, but simple can be rewarding when it is done right; and there are many moments in `A Better Life' that are certainly done VERY right.",1326326400,29,2269,4.452784503631961

4699897,4,B005HFI7IU,"Regardless of your opinion of illegals invading our country, there have been some compelling films made recently (Frozen River, The Visitor, to name a few) that are sympathetic to the cause. American director Chris Weitz has crafted another, featuring a subdued but complete performance by Damien Bechir (nommed by SAG & Oscar), a first-person account of one man's trials to keep family together despite his illegal status, and the paranoia connected to that. His son, played with equal perfection by Jose Julian, is a good kid, though often subjected to the recruitment of gangs. Dad does his best to instill a sense of moral pride in his son, and their relationship is lovingly presented.

It's a fine film, it fine production values and script, belying it's Indie status.

As fine as these films are, it still puzzles me why the government gives so much money to these illegals, and leaves our returning war vets to fend for themselves. My intention is not to provoke an argument; rather, I'm happy to see films like this, presenting a somewhat validation of the well-meaning individuals who want to find a better life here.

And then there are movies such as A Better Life that successfully show the thorny, less antiseptic side - the human side. Beyond this, this movie is a great study of character - that the struggle to do ""what is right and good"" in difficult circumstances is universal - and that we often fall woefully short of our ideals. I found the film refreshingly unpropaganda like. In many ways it reminded me of the writings of Primo Levi. It does what good art should do - point out the fragility of the human condition, and that our attempts to rise above our animal nature are a constant struggle. If you want to be entertained, this may not be the movie for you. But if you appreciate a work of art that makes you think and explore your own soul, don't hesitate to purchase it.",1325203200,4,892,4.478527607361963

4699900,5,B005HFI7IU,"This  movie may not have received enough attention because of  its theme: a father, an illegal immigrant, struggling for a better life for himself and his son. But there isn't a political agenda here, no message that illegal immigration is ""right"" or ""wrong."" The film simply and poignantly portrays one family's experiences. The real surprise is how deftly this is done when it could have been a sloppy or heavy handed movie.

 Carlos, the Mexican father living illegally in Los Angeles, has a stoic integrity and determination. His son Luis gives meaning to his life. Unfortunately, Luis is full  of mixed emotions with anger often winning out. Should he join a gang? Give up hope that things will get better? Reject his father's ""old-fashioned"" values?

The varied characters gave the movie a special intensity for me. The movie doesn't pull any punches or give in to easy solutions or try to hit viewers over the head with a particular point of view. The director ( Chris Weitz) is savvy enough to let events unfold  naturally, showing Carlos at work, Luis dealing with tensions at school and home, father and son struggling to understand each other.

There is also a pivotal event which creates dramatic tension but to mention details would ruin this movie for viewers. How that moment is handled helps define the father/son connection. While I still consider the film well worth seeing, I was a bit disappointed in the abrupt ending and would have liked to see more about how things unfolded. But that is truly a tiny thing for an otherwise superbly done film.",1321315200,9,1566,4.8389513108614235
4699901,5,B005HFI7IU,"A BETTER LIFE is one of the more understated films to come out of Hollywood, a film that has the courage to tell a story that is so politically charged - the immigration debate - that releasing it now is on the one hand asking for negative responses and on the other hand offers to the public the real truths behind our quandary about immigration.  This country consists of immigrants - all of us - no matter how far back we have to trace our ancestry: the only people who did not begin their family history as immigrants from every country in the world  and the Native Americans, and look how we are treating them!  If this film does nothing else than plead the case of human understanding it will have accomplished more than legions of films that touch this subject too lightly.

Carlos Galindo (Demin Bichir, in an extraordinarily fine performance) crossed the border into the US with his new wife, looking for a way to improve his life.  Upon arriving his wife gave birth to their son Luis (Jos Julin) and then promptly left Carlos in search of a better life, leaving Carlos to raise Luis alone.  Carlos is an honest, caring man who must live in the shadow of being illegal: he cannot have a driver's license or papers that allow him the benefits of other people. Carlos has a steady job as a gardener with Blasco (Joaqun Cosio) who owns a truck and the two men work hard as gardeners.

When the film opens Carlos is saving is money from working with Blasco, living in a tiny house in the smarmy side of Los Angeles,  trying to provide better schooling for his 15 year old Luis. Luis is of the age when he is easily influenced by his peers: his best friend is Ramon (Gabriel Chavarria) who is waiting to be of age to join the gang and forget about school in lieu of making money and living high. Luis is tempted to follow him, but he still attends school despite frequent absences and disinterest in education. Carlos is faced with a dilemma: Blasco wants to leave the business of gardening and suggests Carlos buy his truck and tools and start his own business.  While Carlos sees the future in owning his own business (he can provide hope for a better life for Luis) he doesn't have enough money saved to buy the truck.  His sister, indebted to Carlos for his protection and help, brings him her savings and Carlos buys the truck.  Luis is surprised and then proud of his father's courage, but the happiness is short lived as one of the day laborers Carlos befriended - Santiago (Carlos Linares) - steals the truck, sells it on the black market and sends the money to his family in Mexico. It is this moment that provides an important turn for the relationship between Carlos and Luis.  Luis bonds with his father and together they manage to locate the truck and take it back, only to be caught by the police for driving without a windshield.  Carlos is jailed, Luis is devastated, but as Carlos is deported Luis pleads with him to 'come back home'.  The film's ending tests the credibility a bit but it is heartwarming nevertheless.

The story as written by Eric Eason and Roger L. Simon is genuinely real and never veers toward the maudlin.  They have created characters who not only demonstrate the importance of father son understanding and relationships, but they have approached the entire gamut of immigrant challenges and the manner in which this country deals with current immigrants in an honest manner.  Without waving banners for or against immigration problems director Chris Weitz offers us the opportunity to see life from a different angle.  One of the reasons this movie is so powerful in its impact and message is due to the brilliant performance by Demin Bichir, hopefully a candidate for an Oscar, and his performance is beautifully balanced by that of Jos Julin as his son. The film is scored by Alexandre Desplat and the music greatly enhances the rhythms of the story. There is such worth in this film that it would be wise for everyone in this country to view it - and remember our individual heritages and histories.

4699902,5,B005HFI7IU,"A Better Life honestly and poignantly tells the story of a father and son who experience the hardship of poverty in east LA. Carlos Galindo(Demian Bichir) is a former day laborer who has now found consistent work with Blaso Martinez(Jaoquin Cosio), owner of a small Landscaping company that tends to the homes of the rich and affluent of Los Angeles. Luis(Jose Julian) is Carlos teenage son. They live in gang territory where Luis attends a fortess like school where learning is not much of a priority. His friend Ramon(Gabriel Chavarria)just can't wait to join a gang and is pressuring Luis to be initiated into the gang as well. Carlos is a decent and moral person who wants a better life for his son.

As Blasco nears retirement he offers Carlos the opportunity to buy his Ford pickup truck. Buying the truck as you will see also buys the landscaping business. The rich clients will of course recognize the truck and not worry about which illegal has shown up to tend to their opulent lawns. Carlos must chose between the uncertainty of day labor and finding the money to buy the truck. Ultimately he chooses the truck and that is where the tension and drama occur. When his truck is stolen he must get it back. The search to find his truck takes the father and son on a shared journey, a journey that brings them closer together. Carlos is faced with many obstacles where he could easily abandon his moral code and resort to violence. But he doesn't succumb. His son learns from this.

Concerning our immigration policy the Director, Chris Weitz, does no sermonizing. Instead he lets the terrific story stand on it's own merits. And the film has many merits. This movie should encourage you, as it did for me, to reexamine the immigration debate. After watching this enjoyable movie it sparked me to question our immigration policies -what is gained by deporting honest and hard working people like Carlos? Conservatives portray a picture of only bad people, criminals sneaking into this country and causing all kinds of problems. Mostly they are not criminals just people wanting a better life and who are willing to work hard in honest endeavors to earn it. Where are the compassionate conservatives who might favor reform ideas like letting honest persons who have otherwise obeyed our laws and worked hard have the opportunity to become citizens. Immigration enforcement as it now stands is ineffectual and expensive. There has to be a better way.",1319414400,4,2455,4.828978622327791
4699903,4,B005HFI7IU,"Franck Tabouring, DVD Verdict --The plot of A Better Life remains rather simplistic throughout, starting off with a look at Carlos' everyday life as an L.A. gardener. Determined to offer his son a secured future, Carlos invests every dime he has into his buddy's truck and gardening tools, which he plans to use to build his own business. Carlos obviously doesn't have a driver's license or insurance, but he believes he'll be fine as long as he doesn't raise any suspicion. Alas, things take a turn for the worse when one of Carlos' new colleagues steals his truck right from under his nose. As a result, he and his son decide to track down the thief and retrieve the one last thing that binds Carlos to his hope for a better lifestyle.

In a nutshell, the movie spends most of its roughly 100-minute running time following Carlos and Luis as they slowly start to bond while searching for the stolen vehicle. Both characters have opposing views of how to make a living as an illegal immigrant, and their relationship isn't exactly rock solid when we first meet them. While Carlos believes that hard, honest work can indeed lead to a more successful life, Luis finds himself drawn to the dangerous lifestyle of neighborhood gangs. Searching for the truck provides them with opportunities to both implement some of their own ways of handling things, thus building the ideal opportunity for father and son to connect.

While all this sounds very engaging, A Better Life has its weaknesses. While some scenes and plot turns feel a little forced, other moments in the movie do indeed feel a bit overdramatic. A film like this one obviously can't survive without the necessary dose of heartfelt drama, but some of Carlos' and Luis' actions lack plausibility. Additionally, some of the coincidences these two characters clash with end up being more unconvincing than believable. This doesn't hurt the film as a whole that much, but it creates enough cause for viewers to occasionally raise their eyebrows. The film's third act sets itself apart from the rest in that it goes all saccharine on us, but I didn't necessarily consider that to be a flaw.

What really lifts A Better Life into the realm of solid independent dramas is the cast. It goes without saying that Demin Bichir is a fabulous actor, and in the role of concerned father Carlos, he turns in yet another powerful performance. Fueling his character with a strong sense of sincerity, he brings a ton of emotion to his performance, making it incredibly easy for viewers to instantly connect with his personality. Jos Julin's Luis is a bit tougher to like right away, but he too does a fine job portraying a teenage son flirting with gang life. He's the kind of actor whose facial expressions alone say enough about his personality.

Director Chris Weitz brings a simple, yet efficient direction to the project. His filmography includes About a Boy, The Golden Compass, and The Twilight Saga: New Moon, proving he's more than capable of jumping in between genres. His first foray into the independent genre is a success as well. The film's production values are solid, and in terms of technical aspects, A Better Life looks great on DVD. The disc boasts a clean, sharp 1.78:1 widescreen transfer of the feature, shining with great, clear picture quality and decent colors. Audio is provided through a solid Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix. Extras on the DVD include deleted scenes, a music video, and audio commentary by Chris Weitz.

4699904,4,B005HFI7IU,"The apt performances are what make this story watchable (told a hundred times before) and in the end - believable. That and with more hopeful messages than gangs and/or misery being the only answer for the immigrant family in the film; the story allows itself to not make a statement or to be an agenda movie.

The story follows a father and a son as they navigate the daily life decisions in trying to eke out a living in LA. They do this while the dad is an illegal immigrant, and with the fringes of gang life and teen apathy beating at their doorstep. The filming is well done, without there being too much angst, facial pain long takes, or depth into the gang life shown a thousand times before. The Blu clarity is great, even with some tough night shoots and indoor night club facades. The DTS sound is mixed in a mellower fashion than a great deal of the SoCal films, as each sequence with music and chances to hit the bass - doesn't. The outer channels get used lightly but the voices center perfectly throughout.

The special features are scant, with only five minutes of deleted scenes and a director commentary. His narration wears quickly on the film, so I preferred listening to his commentary on the deleted scenes, and for once I actually felt satisfied with one of his explanations as to why a significant scene was cut: not being authentic to gang lifestyle. A music video is also included by Ozomatli.

Region coded A, and the 1.78:1 ratio looked solid. A recommendation even though the theme has been hit many times, but still able to have a fresh and more hopeful ending.",1318809600,6,1591,4.536585365853658
4699905,5,B005HFI7IU,"""A Better Life"" is a poignant story about the struggle of an honest, profoundly decent man to survive as an illegal alien in LA. Utterly devoid of political posturing and moralizing, the film deals instead with the universal human yearning for security, stability, and at least some degree of happiness in one's life.

Completely devoted to his teenage son Luis (Jos Julin), Carlos Galindo (Demian Bichir) maintains his humanity and dignity in the face of greed, deception, and cruelty. The inescapable precariousness of his situation underscores the futility of Carlos' efforts to better the life of his son as well as to improve his own condition. The dream of owning a business, moving to a better neighborhood, and giving his son a good education remains just that - a dream. In the end, an illegal, Carlos submits himself to the law and accepts its harsh verdict of deportation only to attempt to cross the border again, this time to reunite with his son.

The film probably will not change anyone's views on immigration policy in this country, but it cannot leave any thinking person unmoved.",1316736000,90,1098,4.92972972972973
