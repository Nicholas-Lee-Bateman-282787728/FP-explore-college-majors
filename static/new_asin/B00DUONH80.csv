8597983,5,B00DUONH80,"This Kingman presentation by Harry J. Drew so exceeded my expectations! I was stunned with the integrity of this man and the information given about the landing and crashes of UFOs at Kingman. Its obvious that this is thorough methodical research done by Harry to set the story straight for historys sake. Instead of rehashing old existing stories, that never had any real creedencee, he puts in the rough field work that no one has done since the Air Force days! It is amazing what the truth really tells us about this hotbed area.",1529712000,,532,4.670212765957447
8597984,5,B00DUONH80,"Harry Drew seems to be a credible author/historian; yet he has, since 2011, in radio interviews, maintained he is coming out with a book titled, ""7 Days in May; the Kingman UFO Crash,"" but it has yet to be released.  I would like to know when this book is coming out;  or is he just 'saying' it is coming out?  He made the same claim in a 2014 radio interview, that it was coming out in 2015....here it is 2017 and no book.  He made claims on other radio interviews claiming unidentified individuals have made copyright infringement of his pictures, yet he could, as anyone knows, be fully protected, if he published a book on the subject.  It's obvious he has done credible fieldwork and research, but still discusses a forthcoming book....but yet, no book.  Some credible MUFON investigators are now questioning his work, which is unfortunate. Hopefully the book will be out soon.",1509753600,,882,4.694805194805195

8597986,5,B00DUONH80,"I've watched this DVD 3 separate times before making this review.  The discernment and clarity that Harry Drew presents as to what purportedly happened, and where, I have to admit is clear, concise, and compelling. As to whether I'm convinced or not, the jury is still out - though thru no fault of his own above bar presentation.
Overall, this DVD is an excellent tool for sharpening your powers of objective discernment and love of historical perspective. Having it is a journey, not a destination. It continues to intrigue me. I will continue to play it over and over again.",1430697600,,577,4.77
