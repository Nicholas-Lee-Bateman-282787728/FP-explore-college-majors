7269202,1,B00YTSH1YC,"This is one of those series where the actors are all speaking in modern lingo, with modern looking hairstyles and makeup, and modern mannerisms.  Consequently, even though it is set in Canada in the early 1900s or so and they are wearing historical clothing, they come across as  modern day play actors, and it is very difficult to get involved with the story.  Apparently, this is an episode in the series, which is based on a Janette Oke novel. And I found most of the potential beaus to be very callous and unsympathetic.  The girl portraying the teacher is the most likeable one, but somehow, I just felt a disdain for nearly all of the principal characters.",1450310400,,662,4.632478632478633

7269209,5,B00YTSH1YC,"My family has enjoyed very much this series inspired by Janette Oke's novel of the rugged Canadian frontier. From the exclusive behind the scenes interviews it appears the actors also feels the same and perhaps we might see more episodes in the future!

In these latest two episodes of When Calls The Heart we see a deeper relationship evolving between the honest and trustworthy Mountie and Elizabeth the city born teacher whilst both characters demonstrated their love and care for Hope Valley, the community they live in and its citizens.
Of course as in any relationship there are always some rocky moments...
And if some of the developments are a little predictable, it is easily forgiven as we find our favourites amongst the series. Let's not forget the great sceneries and beautiful costumes!

There is no denying the chemistry between both main characters is owed to a good script and the sterling reputation of its director!
When Calls The Heart series 1 and 2 reminds us of Little House On The Prairie, a timeless sitcom any family may sit down with and enjoy even today.
So When Calls The Heart continues in a tradition of good family entertainment with excellent values for young viewers to grow with at the opposite of Hollywood's often tasteless assaults on our senses!

This Hallmark series is well worth checking if you are looking for something to gather the family around and spend quality time!

5 Stars for both episodes!!

7269214,5,B00YTSH1YC,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.
It was the year 2008. That was the year that we gave up television in favor of selected videos and DVDs. That was the year that we gave up trashy commercials, blatant immorality, glorified violence, and filthy language. It's been nice. There are, however, some things on television that are still nice, clean, and wholesome entertainment. The When Calls the Heart Series on the Hallmark Channel is one of those shows. Fortunately for us, the series is also available on DVD.

My girls, especially Amy, get so excited when we get another When Calls the Heart DVD in the mail. I get nagged and nagged for a movie night. ~smile~ As I write this, the girls are psychoanalyzing the three Thatcher sisters while watching the dishes.

My Thoughts

The series is becoming a bit predictable as we get to know the characters better. The responses to situations are ""in character"".
I still enjoy the interaction between Elizabeth and Jack. There are always sparks...sometimes glowing sparks...sometimes infernal sparks.
Charles is such a likeable friend who fits so well with Elizabeth. I wonder if Elizabeth understands that the triangle cannot continue if she marries one. It's reminiscent of the old Christy series love triangle.
We Lane ladies agree that all three sisters need a good spanking. I think Mr. Thatcher needs one, too! They need to grow up, Jesus up, and be nice!
That's all for my rather sassy evaluation. ~smile~

From Emily, 18

The story is becoming very frustrating, because the characters' relationships are becoming so entangled. It's going to be very hard to untangle them.
From Amy, 14
I still really like this series.
The only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really setting a good example for trust in each other.
The clothing is getting more inaccurate to that time period.
Other than that, I like it, but I wish that Bill Avery wouldn't have turned out as ""the bad guy"".

All this to say...
We cannot wait for the next installment in the series!
We love it, we can't wait! It's frustrating. We want to know what happens!",1443657600,,2095,4.773480662983426
7269215,5,B00YTSH1YC,"I have enjoyed all the When Calls the Heart series.  This movie is a clean, romantic movie that I would allow my 8 and 11 year old watch if they wanted to. It has a bit of romance and mystery in it.",1443484800,2,198,3.7142857142857144

7269217,5,B00YTSH1YC,"Those of us that adore Hallmark Channel's series, When Calls the Heart, are referred to as ""Hearties"" and now with the introduction of Heart and Home, the latest DVD from the series has now caused a bit of a stirring up among our favorite characters.

Just when we believe things are settled, there comes a bit of chaos to the mix. Charles is still there as Elizabeth Thatcher's (Erin Krakow) childhood friend that seems to be encouraged by those in Elizabeth's family, all but her sister Julie, that Charles would make a more suitable match than Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing). As they both arrive back to Hamilton with news that Julie and Jack's brother, Tom have been involved in a car accident, the car belonging to Elizabeth's dad. He is all set to prosecute to the full extent of the law and have Tom tossed in jail. He knows that Julie has been a bit headstrong in her opinion that she and Tom are in love and had hoped to get married. But there is one thing Mr. Thatcher wants to control is who his daughters marry and he isn't too thrilled to have either of the Thornton men with interests in his daughters.

As Jack and Elizabeth arrive, the tables get turned a bit for viewers. Jack spends time visiting with his brother Tom in the hospital and manages to convince Elizabeth's father to drop the charges against his brother especially when evidence Jack uncovers tells a much different story about who was really driving the car that day. However he does find a friend in Tom's nurse Faith as the two discover they have quite a bit in common. As a way of thanking her for all her help, Jack meet Faith over dinner and is discovered by Elizabeth's sister and her husband.

Not one to keep secrets she is quick to let Elizabeth know that she saw Jack having dinner with another room, which once again throws a monkey wrench into our favorite couple. Julie and Tom decide not to let their families tell them what to do and make plans to elope. Rosemary is head over heels with the excitement that she has managed to convince Lee Colter to build her a theater. Of course what man wouldn't for a woman he loves. But he still has issues with Mr. Gowen who has vowed to put an end to the impending railroad contract that would promise to be quite the thing the town needs to bring more industry to the town of Hope Valley and make Lee a very wealthy man. But with Elizabeth now heading back to Hamilton to deal with the issues with her family, she leaves the school to a back up teacher who has a less than pleasing disposition with her students and Rosemarie offers to lend a hand of course.

I received When Calls the Heart: Heart and Home from Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review, aside from a free copy of the DVD for review, the opinions contained here are strictly my own personal ones. I have loved this series from it's inception and from Janette Oke's novel which inspired the show. It is one of the true shows that is still family appropriate for all ages much like Little House on The Prairie did for my childhood. Michael Landon Jr is the executive producer and truly the show gets better with each new episode. Much of what I love about this series, it's the fashions and the simplicity of life in Hope Valley compared to that of Hamilton. For me, another 5 out of 5 stars and I can't wait for more. This DVD runs approximately 84 minutes and includes some exclusive behind the scenes interviews.",1443398400,,3499,4.445482866043614
7269218,5,B00YTSH1YC,"When Calls the Heart-Heart and Home is one of the best episodes of this series. I really, really enjoyed it.
  Tom (Jacks brother) and Julie (Elizabeths sister) get into a car accident. So both Jack and Elizabeth go back to Hamilton. Hard feelings and hurt feelings come between are four of these people. Each blaming the other for what happened.
  Them Tom and Julie decide to run off together which causes more problems. Also Elizabeths dad offers Jack a job so he will be good enough for his daughter, which doesnt sit well at all.
  On top of all of that Elizabeth tells Charles she only wants his friendship, but Charles won't let it go.
  You can just imagine  all of the drama and things that could happen with these things going on. Love, love, love this second season of When Calls the Heart. Highly recommend this for everyone who loves action, adventure, faith and love.
