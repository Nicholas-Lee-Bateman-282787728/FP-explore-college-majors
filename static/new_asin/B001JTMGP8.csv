8313757,5,B001JTMGP8,This is my third copy of Stepping Out.  My autistic granddaughter loves this and asks for it every time she visits.  She loves the songs and the actions.  This was recommended to me in a child development class I took 20 years ago.  It engages the children and gets them moving around. We lost the last copy in a move and she asked for it so I bought her another copy.,1483833600,,368,4.140845070422535

8313760,5,B001JTMGP8,I like this because I like Flick a Fly. My favorite is Percival the Parrot. Flick a fly is not disgusting as said in the previous review. Hap Palmer is a good singer. This video is not going to make anyone throw up? I love this video. The previous reviewer is wrong. You should buy this!,1382140800,,287,4.142857142857143
