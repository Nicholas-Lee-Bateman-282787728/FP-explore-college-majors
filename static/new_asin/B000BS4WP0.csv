8091782,2,B000BS4WP0,"Where do I start? Well all the speeches with exception of two are from his first term - his farewell address and the 2000 DNC speech. Many, including the later, are cut short! Why? It makes no sense! And I cannot see any reason for several of the speeches selected for this DVD to be on there. I was under the impression this was supposed to be a collection of his most important and/or greatest speeches to the nation. I was dead wrong! In addition to several others I was really hoping to see I couldn't believe they left out all the state of the union speechs and the 92' and 96' DNC speeches! For any true Bill CLinton fan this DVD is NOT WORTH IT!",1160352000,9,652,4.182539682539683
