7901150,5,8474008662,"""The Kennedy Center Homing"" is packed with inspiration, celebration, worship, and entertainment. Bill and Gloria Gaither bring together an amazing group of friends for this extravaganza performance. Among my favorites were Larnelle Harris and Sandi Patty in an amazing arrangement of ""I've Just Seen Jesus. I was also impressed with the talents of Guy Penrod, Jake Hess, and Andre Crouch.

7901152,5,8474008662,"I have seen most all of the Gaither videos and love each and every one. I will eventually own all of them as does both my brother and sister. Vestal Goodman is my most favorite, but Lillie and all others, especially Karen  Christmas inspire me to greatness. Being from Marietta, Ga. should also  give you a clue as to who I think is the absolute pinnacle of beauty.",953856000,5,365,4.352941176470588
7901153,5,8474008662,"Ever since Bill and Gloria Gaither started the ""homecoming"" series in 1991, it seems like every video just gets better.  ""Kennedy Center Homecoming: A Celebration of Our Faith and Heritage"" is  certainly no exception.  Such songs as ""Bless His Holy Name"" with  Andre Crouch in his first Gaither Video appearance, ""He Hideth My  Soul"", ""Somebody Loves Me"", ""It is No Secret"",  ""God Bless America"", ""Heaven's Joys Await"", ""Jesus  The Waymaker"" and so many others represent the great spiritual and  musical heritage of the American people.  And just about everyone showed up  for this one too.  We enjoy Sue Dodge, The Martins, Lillie Knauls, Janet  Paschal, The Goodmans, The Gaither Vocal Band, Ivan Parker, Andre Crouch,  Joel Hemphill, Joy Gardner, Ann Downing, and about 100 others  ""homecoming friends"" from the beautiful Kennedy Center in  Washington, D.C.
This video stirred my heart like no other has in a  long time.  I found myself crying, rejoicing, laughing, and just praising  God for such a wonderful heritage.  Thank you, Bill and Gloria for keeping  this great treasure before our eyes, figuratively, spiritually, and now  literally.",923702400,22,1147,5.226519337016574
