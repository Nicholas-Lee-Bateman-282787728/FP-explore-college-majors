8316287,4,B001KW5WFA,"It's a good book, and much needed but the DVD is better. In the book there are too many words and not enough pictures. Who wants a book with words? Understanding the value of exercise in Parkinson's disease is useful and helpful but in order to ""move it"" I need to see how it's done, not just read about it. There are a lot of pictures in the book but they are small and the black and white contrast is poor.
If you want a book that tells you why you need to ""move it"" and what you need to do, get this one, but get the DVD with it.",1343260800,6,532,3.8454545454545452
8316288,5,B001KW5WFA,"This is a great video. I'm a health professional and I would recommend this to anyone who needs it. The video is easy to follow, upbeat,and very informative - with step by step instructions. You feel as if you are in good hands with Kevin - the Physical Therapist. And with the new research on how exercise can improve function for people with Parkinson's, this video can actually show you how to get moving.",1230076800,9,408,4.527027027027027
8316289,5,B001KW5WFA,"I have been struggling with Parkinsonianism (parkinsons without a tremor) for several years and without doubt this is the best video I have seen and used.  It is specific in addressing the various aspects of the disease and what exercises to use to help you work on each problem. Famous Amos is a terrific narrator and Kevin Lockette does a great job of explaining the whys and wherefores of each exercise.  The video is especially useful in that the people in the film are all troubled by Parkinsons and his use of them to demonstrate the exercises is very helpful.  It is a ""Where the Rubber Meets the Road"" practical approach to the need for, the benefits of, and results of exercise and movement can help the victims of this very insidious disease.",1229644800,15,752,4.639097744360902
8316290,5,B001KW5WFA,This is one of the best videos I have purchased for my Parkinson's. Very easy to follow instruction with great video demos. I highly recommend this video to people with Parkinson's and even their family members to assist with these exercises.,1226880000,10,242,4.926829268292683
