5834949,4,B00DNF1RDI,Cute and clean movie. I'm tired of movies making it seem like sex and love are the same; I'm glad this movie showed romance and getting to know one another or even being hurt to step back out as being part of finding love.,1405209600,2,222,4.068181818181818

5834951,3,B00DNF1RDI,"This is a heartwarming Christmas romance about love, loss hope and how a puppy can turn a Scrooge into a true believer. I was disappointed in this DVD because none of the dogs could speak; they were just ordinary and lovable.",1389398400,,225,4.512195121951219
5834952,5,B00DNF1RDI,"Acting was good, story line is good, and in the end boy get girl, or girl gets boy whichever you prefer; the only thing that struck me as odd having actually served in the Navy was the way he wore his hat (Like it had never been worn before rather than for eight years) and when I was in Navy seabags were made of white canvass, not Army colored canvass, but then I'm just being picky. Bottom line, my wife and I both love the movie.",1389312000,4,433,4.046511627906977

5834954,5,B00DNF1RDI,I love these Golden Christmas movies and was rather hoping for Golden Christmas 4 this year.  I own the first two and am now buying the third.  I recommend this movie if you like romantic comedy Christmas movies.  Great choice of actors.,1385942400,8,237,4.595238095238095
5834955,4,B00DNF1RDI,"Love them or hate them, it's time again for a Golden Christmas, i.e., cute dogs, a little bit of corny, a little bit of good, and a fair amount of smoochy-woochy, romantic comedy.

This time, bigtime director wanna-be, career minded, Heather(Shantel Vansanten) meets just out of the navy, glad to be home, studly Bobby(Rob Mayes, The Client List, Ice Castles) who had a childhood crush on her.  The attraction is very mutual, but obstacles, including a worthless fiance(Mark Famiglietti), stand in the way of true love.  Plus, she's busy directing ""A Christmas Carol"" with good old, curmudgeon Orson Bean starring as Scrooge.

The story's, of course, quite predictable, a touch silly and over the top; however, the leads are very handsome together with lots of beach shots, and they include some catchy tunes.  The dogs are mostly for backdrop and to sell the theme, perhaps to keep the kids in the room until the kissing starts.  PG.  The ending is very sweet, no giveaway there.

Overall, I'd give 3 1/2 stars for nice looking actors and cute dogs- although, they don't use them enough.  If you like the first 2, you'll like this one; otherwise, run puppy run for something with more meat on the bone.  Sorry for that.

There are no special features.  Gaiam puts it out, and also supports The Petfinder Foundation.",1384819200,6,1316,4.825892857142857

8594838,4,B00DNF1RDI,"In some sunny Californian beach town, Heather Hartley (Shantel VanSanten) teaches theater and directs community theater at the Belmont Theater. Heather aspires to more ambitious things, wants to direct on a bigger stage. For now, she's doing her durndest to orchestrate the local theater production of ""A Christmas Carol,"" never mind that grumpy old stage actor Mr. Cole (Orson Bean) calls her out at every turn. It should be mentioned that Heather has an adorable puppy named Biscuit.

It took six years for her to realize she's stuck in a dead-end relationship. But she's come to her senses now; she's called it quits with the incredibly self-absorbed Roger (Mark Famiglietti), never mind that Roger doesn't seem to take the break-up seriously. He still keeps coming 'round, trying to patch things up, only his overtures come off in the most condescending ways. Like, one time, he busts in during one of Heather's play rehearsals with a pack of Christmas carolers who start singing, ""We wish you a merry Roger."" That made me snort cola out my nose, because talk about your inflated egos, son.

We're made aware that Heather grew up with Bobby Alden (Rob Mayes), except Bobby's been away for a long minute, having enlisted in the military. Now, after eight years in the Navy, this navigation specialist is out the service and come home to the Californian beach town. It should be mentioned that Bobby has a dog named Luigi, and you should blame Luigi and Heather's Biscuit for these two's reacquaintance. And maybe I shouldn't judge Bobby too harshly for being in the Navy eight years and being only a 2nd Class Petty Officer.

Home for Christmas: A Golden Christmas 3 first aired in 2012 on the Ion channel. Two things form the connective tissue between this movie and the other Golden Christmas movies. One is the presence of young Myra (Alexandra Peters) who was in the second movie and is Bobby's niece and is also in Heather's acting troupe. The other thing is more tenuous. It's assumed that Alley Mills - who was in the first two movies - is playing the same character in this one. You can eyeball her seated in the front row, wearing a red top, as ""A Christmas Carol"" plays out to the audience.

I liked this movie. 3.5 out of 5 stars for it. Truth be told, it's not much of a holiday movie, in part because it's hard to pull off a credible holiday movie in the sunny Cali climate, and in part because, most of the time, the movie is pretty blas about tying the yuletide season into its narrative. It's not much of a dog movie, either, as the cute pets are mostly kept in the periphery of the plot. Honestly, there isn't much in the way of dramatic conflict. Roger is such a cartoonish figure he can't be taken seriously as a credible rival for Heather's affections. And, oboy, so much matchmaking goes on... The one genuine obstacle comes up late in the movie - and these things always come up late in the movie when things are going well for our two leads - and it's more to do with a drastic change in Heather's career trajectory more so than with anything romantic. Cue the stupid argument and misunderstanding and hurt feelings. Cue the happy ending in which the movie seems to be striving for a Sleepless in Seattle vibe, except it doesn't pull it off as gracefully. So why do I like the movie? It's more to do with the performances. Shantel VanSanten and Rob Mayes are just nice together and in their individual scenes. But it's not only them. Other than the over-the-top Famiglietti as the narcissistic Roger, the supporting cast is pretty wonderful and warm and inviting. And the young girl, Alexandra Peters, is a natural. Mostly, I find that if I'm down with the cast, then I'm down with the movie even if its narrative is derivative of so many other clichd romcom plots. Ion channel, you got me again.",1487980800,,3822,4.632743362831858
