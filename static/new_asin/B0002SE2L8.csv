8031281,4,B0002SE2L8,"""Jesus - Fact or Fiction"" is an intriguing DVD with very convincing arguments that are set up as questions and answers. You can select individual questions or watch multiple answers as you select sections of questions. While watching it was interesting to understand that secular history alone proves that Jesus really lived. All too often people say Jesus is just a myth, while at the same time believing other historical facts they would never know unless someone told them. What is also very meaningful on this DVD is the testimonies of how God has changed lives.

Some of the questions this DVD answers include:

Does God exist?
Is the Bible true?
Is there a designer behind the universe?
Is heaven a reality?

The second part of this DVD is a link to a Jesus movie which I'd never heard of or seen before. It is a deeply thoughtful movie with a gentle Jesus who heals the sick and raises a girl from the dead. Jesus is one of the most fascinating people in history and he showed himself to be God by having the power of life over death. I felt this movie was beautifully filmed and presented a very realistic portrait of the times in which Jesus lived. I felt the crucifixion scenes were not overly gruesome as some movies portray them. I also loved the scene of where the woman washes Jesus' feet with her tears and anoints him with perfume. There is also a scene where a dove lands on Jesus' shoulder. The only mistake the movie makes is in saying Jesus went from Bethlehem to Nazareth - I believe Jesus went to Egypt first as a baby or young child. The movie completely avoids a discussion of that subject - as to why he went to Egypt. But otherwise everything in the movie seemed on track.

So enjoy having your questions asked and relax with a good spiritual movie. This was made back in 2004 but the truths are still relevant today.

8031283,5,B0002SE2L8,"This DVD has the entire Jesus Movie that has been viewed all over the world in many languages - an excellent portrayal of the life of Christ.
The DVD also answers many of the hard questions people ask about Jesus and faith in Him - an excellent resource for the seeking soul or the skeptical questioner.",1375488000,2,303,4.428571428571429
8031284,1,B0002SE2L8,"I want to caution people to know the beliefs of each contributor in the question & answer section of this video if you are giving it as a gift to help someone come to know Christ or just looking for answers. I am no scholar, however I do study the word & theology daily to understand what beliefs are in the church & the bias they have outside of the word...so If I am in error here my apologies.

I noticed one of the Philosophy professors R. Douglas Geivet in the Questions section made a comment that I thought may be a subtle inference of Armineism. He said that God can arrange for all those people that "" He Knows Would Believe"" to hear the message. He than goes on to say that "" Its Possible that God knew"" that this mans heart would be responsive. The question was in regards to people that have never heard about Christ. I am not disagreeing that God can & does arrange all things. I do not agree that God's purpose & decision in Salvation is based on knowing how man believes or responds...That gives man a cause to boast. "" It is by faith alone"" Read Romans 8& 9...John 6. It is God's Soverein will & God's purpose not mans, we are only on the undeserved recieving end of God's mercy & grace. I realize his comment was in regards to those that have not heard about Christ, but the way he said it sounded like an Arminian belief on Election. I am not saying that this man is an Arminian, only that to me it sounded like it leaned in that direction. My strong concern here is that this man says "" It's Possible that God knows."" For this to be a teaching video for people that have doubts & questions needing answers, I feel that one statement alone to be very serious in regards to God knowing everything. It places a doubt as to how much God knows, what control He has and so forth...

As always God has cautioned all  to "" Test the Spirits to see if they are of God"". So know what you are learning when it is outside the word & from man...

If I have offended anyone my apologies that was not my intention.",1341619200,2,2017,4.164102564102564
8031285,5,B0002SE2L8,A great product.  Contains not only answers to many probing questions people raise but the full length version of the Jesus film.  The answers to the probing questions are brief and compelling.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with serious questions about Jesus Christ and the Christian faith.,1336348800,,305,5.06
8031286,5,B0002SE2L8,"This dvd is a culmination touching on all the best information about the life of Jesus Christ to date. If anyone wants to know more about WHO Jesus is; WHY He came to earth; and HOW His life HAS, and IS impacting the lives of millions of people, especially within the last 2000+ years, this dvd, with over 4 hours of video material: The ""Jesus Film"", testimonials, and expert's profiles, with many questions answered - is perfect!

The Jesus Film mentioned above was completed in 1979, and since that time has been translated into over 1121 different languages, ""...far more than any other film in history..."" It has been viewed over 6 BILLION times. Literally, ""Hundreds of millions have become followers of Jesus... by His power and love.""
  And this recent phenomena was made possible through the vision of a few, and expanding modern tecnologies, thus fulfilling a Biblical prophecy by Jesus Himself in the gospel according to Matthew, chapter 24 verse 14.

I've questioned and researched almost everything that life has brought before me since 1971, wading through 1000's of movies, videos, plays and programs, books and tapes. I've had personal discussions and disputes with many persons on many related subjects and studied the teachings and doctrines of a host of Churches, political and  historical groups and organizations of many kinds; mythical, ideological, religious and science based.

In my opinion, this dvd offers any person interested,  ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW about Jesus' message to the world.",1305676800,4,1512,5.07258064516129
8031287,3,B0002SE2L8,"It's not really ""bad"" I would say but if you have, to say the least a semi-good understanding of the bible then this dvd is not for you. I was expecting a little more depth to the answers and maybe some interesting facts from history or archaeology and its pretty well a click question, they answer and then click your next question and they answer. Most questions take less than 1 min to answer.

If you know someone or you yourself haven't really done any deep study of the bible and its claims for authenticity or reliability then this a good a dvd as it'll point you in the right direction and give you some good starting points.",1283212800,4,633,4.364406779661017
8031288,5,B0002SE2L8,"This is a fantastic DVD to give out to people, to work through as a small group of friends, or to have as a reference to pull out when tough questions arise.  I really enjoyed all the questions about God that are answered in it, and the Jesus movie being on there is an awesome bonus.",1140566400,13,284,4.071428571428571
8031289,5,B0002SE2L8,"This is an interactive DVD with more than 100 options to explore questions on 1)Deism vs. Christianity 2)Scientific and Historical Evidence for the Bible 3)Exploration on Absolute vs. Relative Truth 4)Atheism vs. Deism 5) Life after Death, expert profiles on the professors, scientists, philosophers answering the questions, and real life stories of personal spiritual journeys.

If you've ever read the Case for Christ by Lee Strobel (whose profile and life story are on the DVD), this is basically the DVD version of that investigation.  In DVD format, this presentation is much more personal (In today's world, reading comprehension seems to be rapidly becoming a lost art).  I believe that this format is perfect for discussing the truth about Jesus because the topics for discussion are so diverse that being able to toggle between menus really allows you to arrive at some important conclusions.

But don't be put off by the completeness of the DVD.  The DVD was created for those that have little or no knowledge of Jesus.

 I gave the DVD 5 stars because of the importance of the information given, the way the DVD is organized, and the way the interplay between the two gives the Truth about Jesus a freshness that is often missing in most other presentations. Despite the quite mundane cover, I think it's 5 stars material",1129334400,24,1332,4.972972972972973
