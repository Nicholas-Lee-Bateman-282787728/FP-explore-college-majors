8536661,2,B0096EVRB2,"As other reviews have noted, this is a very childish film, but it is not clear how much it can be expected to appeal to children, since it has very little by way of a general plot line. Krishna is represented as an obstreperous child, with few redeeming features except opposing a megalomaniac tyrant. The cartooning, as graphic art, is excellent (and has won prizes), but that is not really enough to carry the film.",1424476800,,417,4.573333333333333
8536662,4,B0096EVRB2,Quite violent for a small children's animation!!,1421452800,,48,6.0
8536663,5,B0096EVRB2,Very good movie except for odd loongggggg demon women Putna low grade animation scene about 3-5 min long it seemed. Very good for sharing the childhood of Krishna.,1420934400,,163,4.857142857142857
8536664,5,B0096EVRB2,My kids absolutely love it. I enjoyed it as well.,1406937600,,49,4.0
8536665,5,B0096EVRB2,"Really fun and dramatic for kids, very much accurate to the real story.  Since truth is stranger than fiction, this account of Krishna's initial demonstration of his glory was beautifully depicted and the ego is thus defeated, no matter how great its threat.  After all God is victory, and wrong often appears more powerful to worldly eyes, but then rightousness rules!  Really cool stuff.  It's for adults and kids.",1396742400,,416,4.9855072463768115
8536666,5,B0096EVRB2,"Wow! This was an Awsome telling of the Krsna story! This film was beutiful! Having read the story of ""Krsna the supreame personality of God head"", I was wondering ""how"" they would tell the story of his birth? It was handeled wonderfuly! Plus the way they took you threw the longer parts of his childhood, Just Awesome! It seems every ""Disney international"" animated film from the Hindu epics just keeps getting better!! I'm Glad to see that ""ALL"" the people that have comented with a positive respounce!! These films ARE REALLY AWESOME! AND ACTION PACKED!!! You might have a problem becouse ""sum"" don't have ""ENGLISH SUB-TITLES"" But they are WORTH IT!!! Please if you've not seen thes films yet, DO SO!!! As a Side note LUV-KUSH ""THE WARRIOR TWINS"" IS Awesome as well!! LUV and Kush are Lord Ram's twin sons from the ""RAMAYANA"" And it Also is a Animaited Disney movie!",1384819200,5,868,4.717105263157895

8536668,5,B0096EVRB2,"Gave this as a present to my kids and they loved it and are enjoying it to the fullest!  The best part is, audio being in english.  Very good animation quality and a very nicely presented story.  Story starts with Krishna's birth and end with Kansa's death.  Very nice way of teaching kids about Krishna...they just fell in love with Him!",1378252800,3,338,4.491803278688525
