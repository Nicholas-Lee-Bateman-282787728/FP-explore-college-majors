5423831,2,B00AFQSXEO,I didn't like the going back then and the way it did it so many times.  It was very ignoring!,1368489600,,93,3.65
5423832,2,B00AFQSXEO,"It was cute...I guess? I mean, the high school story-line was more interesting than the adult one, but I also would have preferred to see more of the adult plot (if only it were better written/acted).
I think Tae Heckard is gorgeous and Malinda Williams is adorable, but their roles were so blah.
The concept isn't new and it's been done way better. C-/D",1365724800,4,354,4.546875
5423833,4,B00AFQSXEO,It was about high school friends one young men like this girl one girl and his best friend liked him,1363651200,,100,4.05
5423834,3,B00AFQSXEO,This movie was actually ok. I was skeptic in the beginning but overall it was worth watching. I love the actors and some of the one liners were great. It did kept me interested which is hard to do so I would recommend at least watching it once.,1362614400,,244,4.104166666666667
5423835,2,B00AFQSXEO,"This movie showcased good actors, but the story line sucked.  Did not keep my attention, actually I fell asleep watching it.  However, I purchase the instant video for just $2.99 which I count not a big lost.  But I would definitely not recommend buying the dvd.",1361836800,4,262,4.6521739130434785

5423841,2,B00AFQSXEO,Didn't watch the whole movie; the first five minutes contained so much profanity it lost my attention; can someone please produce and direct a movie starring minorities without so much profanity and vulgarity?,1405641600,,209,5.363636363636363
5423842,5,B00AFQSXEO,Cute movie especially if you like to reminisce,1404259200,,46,4.875
5423843,4,B00AFQSXEO,I always look forward to watching black films and this one surprised me. You never really know what you are in store of with a lot of the lower budget films but true talent rings true with some actors/actresses. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I usually don't like a movie with the flash backs but it was done perfectly. I'm a sucker for happy endings also. I would recommend this to anyone that loves movies as much as I love them. Like I told my fiance... you have to give them a chance first before saying they are whack or not good. It was good.,1401926400,4,551,4.158878504672897
5423844,3,B00AFQSXEO,Great back in the day movie. Sometimes we miss the fact that our BFF can be our Soulmate in the end.,1399334400,,100,3.8095238095238093
5423845,5,B00AFQSXEO,"I loved this movie, I am so worn out with trauma, and tragedy movies. Even tho  it did not have a budget to enhance the flash backs, they did a great job telling the story of teenage first love. I loved the fact that Gavin was so focused on achieving his dreams, and succeeding, coming from an environment, where this teacher, the neighborhood, and his crazy home life did not really give him the support that he needed. The cast of different characters was funny, and enjoyable, I think they were developed well. I went to a high school like that, I saw those same type of people everyday, and I loved it then and I love the memory of it now. I have seen these actors in other movies, and enjoyed them all.",1396828800,,707,4.276119402985074
8551108,3,B00AFQSXEO,Not horrible..The actors were pretty good..Especially loved Debra Wison.,1515801600,,72,7.111111111111111

8551113,1,B00AFQSXEO,"I saw a couple of recognizable actors,so I thought at the very least it should be ok,Wrong!.this was a waste of time. I managed to hang in there for about 10 minutes,I didn't see it getting any better.",1458777600,,201,4.315789473684211
8551114,5,B00AFQSXEO,Enjoyed the movie. Had many moments of laughter mixed with only one scene of tears.,1455667200,,83,4.6
8551115,3,B00AFQSXEO,"First, I would like to say I love the cast and the 90's nostalgia. This is a small independent film so I didn't expect anything huge. The movie plot is as BASIC as it gets. *Spoiler* A guy's female best friend stuck by his side over the years but then becomes his lover when they grow up...ohhh never seen that before! *Sarcasm*

The movie summary says ""Gavin Miller leaves behind the trauma."" There really wasn't that MUCH trauma other than social awkwardness that every high school student goes through and the predictable death of an irrelevant character. I can see if the lead character was shot himself, but it was one of those characters you didn't get attached to so it was like oh okay, how sad but I didn't really know him.

If you're bored, it's a good watch. But don't expect the same throwback quality of the 1999 movie ""The Wood"" just because you see ""Alicia"" (actress Malinda Williams).",1441843200,,900,4.583850931677019
8551116,5,B00AFQSXEO,This was a really great movie.  Loved the writing.,1436054400,,50,4.555555555555555
