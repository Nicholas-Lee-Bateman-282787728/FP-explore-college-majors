This DVD makes apparent the considerable influence these unseen factors play in our lives. The visuals in this presentation are well done.",1355702400,,259,5.046511627906977
8406131,5,B003UQC1HG,"This is a great film about microorganisms that live all around (and in) us. Fast paced and on topic film with excellent micro-video footage.
The three episodes that are on the disk are:
(1) ""In Our World"" ""See what you've been missing in the invisible world of light, earthly forces and microbes.""
(2) ""In The Air"" ""Take an unfiltered look at what we're inhaling with every breath. From space dust and microscopic skin flakes (you are shedding 1 1/2 million per hour) to invisible colonies of bacteria.""
(3) ""In the Water"" ""Dive into an invisible world you'll have have to see to believe."" Includes phytoplankton, parasites and extremophiles.

The students really like this eye opening and visually attractive presentation about the unseen world we so seldom think about.  Just make a worksheet to go with the sections you are showing to keep the students focused. (Here Discovery Channel could take a clue from NOVA that includes printable teaching materials on many of its DVDs.)  Includes English subtitles that help your hearing impaired and English Language Learners.  Just stop at points where the students need to copy down a term.  Wish they had included Spanish subtitles as an option.

As a public school teacher I use ""The Unknown Word"" (60 min - Nova - 1966 DVD) to teach about human parasites and microorganisms in our environment, which I still use and recommend, however, ""What You Can't See"" has newer video and more information.",1289606400,10,1445,4.950413223140496
