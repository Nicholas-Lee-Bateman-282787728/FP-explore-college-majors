8200501,5,B000RG116E,I've always been interested in NLP and this is a good video for understanding NLP and applying it to communications and sales. Well presented and lively lecture presentation. Service on the product was excellent also.,1365724800,,217,5.228571428571429
8200502,5,B000RG116E,"I love the review below that is written by someone who says that this WORKBOOK was too basic and a waste of time, and that it contained no new information.  This is one of the BEST handlbooks for TODAY'S sales techniques that has ever been written. The other reviewer no doubt has read many books and been to lots of seminars. I have met people like that who say ""I've already seen that"".  He totally missed the POINT of this great workbook!

This book by Duane Lakin and the available Video workshop under the same title are both designed to make smae excellent ""psychology based communication techniques"" into a skill set that you can actually USE.  Yes, ""modalities"" and understanding them are hardly a NEW concept.  I wonder if the author is actually able to USE them in a selling situation?  Learning to recognize modalities in people and tailor your presentation to those modalities is extremely effective in a selling and closing situation.  People like to buy from people that are ""like they are"".  Mr. Lakin gives you practical exercizes in this workbook that will allow you to become a ""PRACTITIONER"" of these effective skill sets.  So while some people are still out there looking for the latest and greatest NEW IDEA, you can be closing more sales.  This WORKBOOK will help you apply these psychological techniques in building RELATIONAHIPS with prospects that make YOU the right person to buy from. If you are still using ""trial closes"" as one of your techniques, you should know that for years they have taught those in Tpper Ware classes. This WORKBOOK will put some things in your bag that really work! Great selling",1301875200,,1632,4.775800711743773

Like a fool I paid my money and all I got was just very very basic NLP course rehashed.

Yes we know about modalities, yes we know about eye accessing...it's been around for years, and has been repeated again and again.

I kept waiting for the new stuff but it just never arrives. Only buy this course if you have never been exposed to NLP, otherwise don't bother.

8200504,5,B000RG116E,"The advantage of being unfair.  Who says the world is fair?

In fact, unfairness creates fairness.  Using NLP, you'll create fairness with your clients in that you really understand what they need and sell them what they want.

So if you are into sales or going into sales, you need to master NLP for selling.  The Unfair Advantage is my top choice.

Take action base on the ideas.  I just took one and it really gave me a pleasant surprise: I closed a deal with just change in one line!
