4601162,5,B0058O1FDO,Timmy Time is the preschool version of Shaun the Sheep and it is a cute show that I don't mind watching with my boys!  There are fun songs and typical preschool behavior that my boys can relate to.  The animals are all adorable and it is a claymation-type show which is a nice break from cartoons.,1318118400,,297,4.285714285714286

8461906,5,B0058O1FDO,My son loves Timmy. He watches it in the car. The theme song is very catchy and none of the characters actually talk. They just make the noises of whatever animal they are. I feel like this sets up reasonable expectations for when he sees real life sheep.,1485475200,,255,4.333333333333333

8461908,3,B0058O1FDO,I gave it 3stars only because it entertained my grandson. I think it didn't have enough language content for any age! For children at the age this is suited for it should have much more language. Good silly content but that's about all.,1473379200,,236,4.511627906976744
