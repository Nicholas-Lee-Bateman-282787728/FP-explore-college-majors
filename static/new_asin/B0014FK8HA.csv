8255589,5,B0014FK8HA,"great movie, really good writing and good directing. all the actors did a fantastic job and the story carried many lessons. the value of friendship being at the top of all these, true friendship always shows through eventually. have not come to really appreciate great movies until my senior years, but better late than never.",1455840000,,326,4.945454545454545

8255591,4,B0014FK8HA,"Graduation is an intense and clever thriller that surprised the hell out of me. It only got 3 1/2 stars, because the beginning drags on forever, but by the end of this film, you will be very satisfied. This young cast led by TV veteran, Chris Marquette, follows four best friends approaching their high school graduation. Unfortunate circumstances lead them to need a large sum of money and they come up with the only option available to them, rob a bank. This is a tough film to review without spoilers, so I can't say more than that, but this is a very clever film, with some great young actors. Although it was slow at first, the ending makes it all worthwhile, and you'll be very surprised at where the groups choices lead them. This may be a b-movie with a no-name cast, but it's one that will change the way you think about certain things and I highly recommend it!",1361491200,,871,4.45
8255592,3,B0014FK8HA,"I really enjoyed this movie. Did i think it was the best acting ever? Was the script oscar worthy? No, but it was fun, intense, and just funny enough to hold my interest for an hour and a half.",1295481600,,193,3.9743589743589745
8255593,3,B0014FK8HA,"There is nothing that is above average about this movie. We have seen these type of teen heist movies before. This movies adds nothing to this genre. The actors are all pretty much second rate wannabes. None of the performaces are worth mentioning individually. It's basically just a bunch of dumb kids that decide to rob a bank. The story is pretty straight forward and there is no major twist. I definately would not buy this one. It's not all bad. There are a couple of interesting scenes and the end is ok. Maybe, you can rent it if you really like this genre. I give this 1 SILLY TEEN THUMBS UP for at least trying to entertain me. HOLLA",1276819200,,642,4.358333333333333
8255594,5,B0014FK8HA,"This movie is SO under rated!! I loved the plan then the little twist at the end was so cool! Chris Lowell is amazing, he is amazing period. I really wish he did more films. I have seen most of these actors in small roles before but this movie was great!! Please don't judge & just go see it!",1226361600,,292,3.9661016949152543
8255595,4,B0014FK8HA,"This is a fun heist movie concerninng several high school friends who plan a bank robbery on their graduation day.  The reason?  To help one of the kids' mom's, who needs a bone marrow transplant.  Sounds a little trite, yea, but if you get past that, you get to have quite a bit of fun.  Some of the most recognizable late teen early twenties stars of shows like Veronica Mars, Joan of Arcadia, and The O.C. come together in an ensemble cast.  The heist plan is fun, but more fun are the wrinkles that occur when things start to unravel, as they inevitably do.  Surprisingly, the movie has more than a little heart, and the twist at the end is not exactly the craziest twist you've ever seen, but it is remarkably satisfying nonetheless.  This is a good Friday night pizza movie, not suitable for younger kids as there is a fair amount of sexual innuendo.  No skin, no real violence, and a ton of fun.  Definitely a good time, just don't expect ""Ghandi"" and you'll be alright.",1223078400,2,977,4.443820224719101
8255596,5,B0014FK8HA,"This movie was fantastic!  I saw it in an advanced screening and it really blew me away.  Everyone in the (packed) theater agreed that it was a great movie.  As soon as you're are able to see it, do see it!  I'm waiting to add the DVD to my collection!",1208476800,3,252,3.98
