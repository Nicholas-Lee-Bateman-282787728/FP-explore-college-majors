8048581,4,B0007LXOY6,"Best Motoring International is always a show that is very technical, but still very fun for even the automotive novice. They teach you about the cars, show you their strengths and weaknesses, and then they pit them against other cars of the same class, and explain why they did well, or not so well. I consider BMI to be the best show to watch in terms in automotive knowledge, and even fun. It's also fun to see the touge racing and the highly tuned cars race, and to see the driving techniques you need to harness in order to control such dangerous cars and conditions.",1305504000,,571,4.447619047619048
