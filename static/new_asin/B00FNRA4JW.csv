8617308,4,B00FNRA4JW,"It was impressive to see the collection of sitcom stars tackling such a serious dramatic movie. David Ogden Stiers, Billy Crystal, Jeff Conoway, and Bonnie Franklin all carried their parts remarkably. Even actors who regularly act in dramas (Robert Conrad) exceeded expectations for me with this movie. I didn't see the need for it to be cut into 2 parts, but I'm happy I took a chance on picking this one up.",1501632000,2,409,4.694444444444445
8617309,4,B00FNRA4JW,"With a terrific cast like Ted Bessell, Billy Crystal (SOAP), Robert Conrad, Jeff Conway (Taxi and Grease) and David Ogden Stiers (MASH), you can't go wrong. They play a group of friends who all happen to be going through a breakup, divorce or loss and spend the summer at a beach house in Malibu. Bonnie Franklin played one of the love interest and did a very good job with her performance.

The DVD has the film split into two parts, Night One and Night Two. I don't think this film needed to be a two part mini-series but television was quite different in the late seventies. By watching this film on DVD, the quality is definitely a hundred times better than what I saw on VHS tape. The  DVD had an issue at the end of the film anyway.

If you want to be nostalgic about a time gone by where networks used to provide a creative outlet like television movies and specials for their actors, you might want to watch this two part mini-series about grown men who aren't caricatures or cardboard figures. They really become emotional about their lives and divorce.",1471910400,2,1062,4.492227979274611
