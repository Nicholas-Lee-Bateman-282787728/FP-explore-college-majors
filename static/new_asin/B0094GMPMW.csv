5261377,5,B0094GMPMW,"One of my grandsons just loves Pocoyo and I admit I really like him and his friends also. This cartoon has some very lovely, gentle moral stories behind them without being preachy. There's a diversity of characters without having it feel like someone assembled a politically correct cast. The best thing about this cartoon is the humor. Even I have laughed out loud. It's just funny and not at another character's expense. My grandson is so taken with Pocoyo that I've had to buy him the stuffed toy versions of the characters which is so much better than some of the other toys out there. There's no violence or being mean. If a character's feelings get hurt, the others are quick to point it out to the offender who does whatever is necessary to make amends. It's just a sweet, lovely cartoon that can be enjoyed by little ones and grandparents together. I really like that it can make you laugh also.",1362182400,3,903,4.580246913580247
