6854739,2,B00Q5NUTNY,"Warning: possible spoilers.

A black man (Noel Clark) wakes up in the back of a van with a young boy and no memory of how he got there.  They escape on foot when the van stops.  While they are hiding in the bushes the black man realizes that months have passed since his previous memory.  Then the black man wakes up in a completely different environment, a different situation--and then another and another.  He's the doctor in a room where a suspected terrorist is being water-boarded; he's in a bordello trying to break a young prostitute out of the building; he's in a laboratory with a scientist who is going to create a very nasty man-made pandemic that creates grotesque genetic mutations in the infected--and on and on and on.  The only constants are that each episode lasts 10 minutes or less and that the same white dude (Ian Somerhaider) in a suit keeps showing up in most of the scenarios and that he at least seems to know exactly what's going on.

The Anomaly is intriguing at first as the hero moves from one jarring situation to another trying to figure out a little bit more about what's happening to him before his 10 minutes are up and also trying to figure out how he can save the kidnapped boy from the opening sequence.  It' wants to be a puzzle film like Memento or Timecrimes but the the pieces never fit together-the incidents we see represent jumps in time of weeks or months and the movie doesn't try to fill in the gaps of what we missed, making The Anomaly frustratingly difficult to follow.  The script is the structural equivalent of reading a book for 30 pages, skipping 40 pages, reading another 50 pages, skipping 40 pages and reading 30 pages more--how much sense is the book going to make if you read it like that?  That's basically The Anomaly where we miss much more of the story than we actually see and are left to piece together the plot with very little help from the film.  It's definitely a novel way to tell a story but not a very good one.

The Anomaly is so confusing that I didn't even realize until hours after I watched it that everything I saw was chronologically sequenced and that the hero was waking up in the same body, his own, every time he became conscious for 10 minutes.  I thought he was possessing different bodies throughout the film which I now realize was wrong--but in my defense it shouldn't take so much time and effort to make sense of a 96 minute sci-fi action movie.",1418342400,6,2437,4.461711711711712
6854740,4,B00Q5NUTNY,"Ryan (Noel Clarke) suffers from PTSD. He has severe memory lapses where he is someone else. He has 10 minute intervals to ""reboot."" During those 10 minute intervals he tries to save a young boy (Art Parkinson) a prostitute (Alexis Knapp) and the world while keeping time with an Omega watch and trying to figure things out.

This was an interesting sci-fi film as well as an action film as Ryan physically battles his employers and their enemies too. The computer graphics and special effects were excellent for an indie. There is an air of mystery as Ryan and the audience try to figure out what is happening. A must for indie sci-fi fans.

6854752,2,B00Q5NUTNY,"Interesting concept with potential but could have been way better if executed with some more thought. There are lots of holes and inconsistencies that make this a bit confusing and an ultimately frustrating movie (because you can see the story's potential, but it is poorly executed). The story is ultimately successfully revealed by the end, but there are just too many stupid, unbelievable, B-grade movie moaning-and-groaning spots to get through. The lead character does an OK job considering. The ""bad-guys"" could stand to be less visually greasy. The criticisms of the fights scenes in other reviews is spot on, the slow-mo action is cheesy and there are way too many fights. The gratuitous sex and nudity scenes seem to be added for effect and no real purpose but to bring in more bad guys to have fight scenes.",1464998400,,817,4.927536231884058

All I know is that this film is superbly entertaining and he did a splendid job as star and director. The supporting actors are excellent as well, and the babe is like crazy hot, dayum! Clarke's screen presence is powerful and the special effects are very well done. If you like sci-fi action thrillers, there's nothing not to like about this movie unless you have an axe to grind against the star/director because he thinks he's all that which by the way he is. Immerse yourself in this edge-of-the-seat mystery/fantasy which also has well-presented high-tech and high-level conspiracy elements to it. Enjoy!",1445904000,2,739,4.826771653543307
6854770,4,B00Q5NUTNY,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Intelligent science fiction never goes out of style, and the genre seems to be experiencing an uptick in entries.  Films like CHAPPIE, INTERSTELLAR, and TIME LAPSE immediately spring to mind.  These are well-written, smart, and extremely entertaining films.  Im proud to announce THE ANOMALY will now join that list.  This film is a mind-bending journey into action and intrigue.  It yanked me in from the opening scene and never let go.  If you are any kind of fan of slick sci-fi, then this is a film you simply must check out!

I am stunned to see IMDB reviewers giving this movie such a low score (4.8 out of 10 stars from 4,788 users, as of the time of this review).  This makes me wonder if these viewers did not understand the movie or grasp its concept.  Granted, its not something you pick up immediatelybut the film reveals just enough to keep the audience interested until all is revealed about three-fourths of the way in.

THE ANOMALY is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  I have to commend the cinematographer for the unique and inventive views the audience is given during the film.  This is a testament to the talent involved with this production.  For example, during one of Ryans fight scenes, the camera slowly moves up a wall and drops down behind it, giving us the view of the fight as seen through a bullet-proof glass window.  The sound becomes muffled, but the intensity of the fight never stops.  Then, after a moment, the camera moves back into original position, and the original sound returns.  This is slick and original, and it makes the scene so much more fun to watch.

The acting in THE ANOMALY is top notch, with director Noel Clarke as the lead character, Ryan.  Ive enjoyed Clarkes work for several years now, watching him in a variety of genres and titles, from DOCTOR WHO to DOGHOUSE to STORAGE 24, and now this.  I never tire of watching him, and Im excited to discover he has skill behind the camera as well as in front of it.

The storyline is the biggest winner here, though.  Rife with intrigue and mystery, this thriller quickly burrows into your brain and captivates you through to the end.  Just when I thought I had things figured out, the movie shifted gears and threw a new curveball at me.  Finally, when the big reveal is given, the brilliance of the writing shines through and everything comes together.

My sole complaint about this film (and its a very minor one) is the mediocre fight choreography.  I suppose the fight scenes are ok as a whole, but the constant slow-motion interruptions (for example, a guy throws a punch and the camera slows down to super slow-motion to capture itthen speeds back up as his fist makes contact) become old real fast.  Im not sure why these were included, but they make the fighting look fake.

But that point aside, THE ANOMALY is a hell of a science fiction thriller, and I highly recommend it.  Boasting a star-studded cast and a clever concept, this is one film youll want to experience several times to get its full effect.  This is available now in a variety of formats, but make sure you give it a look on Blu-ray; youll truly appreciate the HD picture and sound.",1444348800,8,3240,4.584347826086956
8690467,1,B00Q5NUTNY,"I enjoy SYFY & action flicks; with a twist of ( the who, where, how & why concept) but this is a ridiculously choppy plot that literally takes an hour to progress to the basic understanding of the Character living these "" alternate lives.

I could not see giving it even 2 Stars and f found it a waste of my Money, Time, & Sanity. I couldn't finish viewing it in one sitting.",1505001600,,541,4.252427184466019

I'd give this a solid 3.5 if I could.
True, it's not exactly Oscar-winning acting, but the storyline & fight scenes keeps it interesting enough that I really wanted to finish it. It's actually a good *action* movie,  too, and I wasn't expecting that. I had a whole different idea of what this was about, so I was pleasantly surprised! Noel is really great to watch, as even in the fight scenes he comes off as a ""graceful"" man. Smooth, sleek, and deadly.  I hope we'll be seeing more of him in American movies.
And maybe I'm just slow on the uptake, but there was a really interesting plot twist about 3/4 of the way in, so that was great.
While I have encountered a similar subject, I've not seen it in a story like this.
If you enjoy syfy, intrigue, and action all in one movie, I suggest you see this one. Enjoy!",1500595200,,829,4.3076923076923075

I miss movies like this because even though we are flooded with extreme graphics and action with this wave of superhero movies which I have to say are all missing something...The Anomaly provides and fills that gap. The actor on the cover is not the good guy, I say this because it was a breath of fresh air to see the main actor...I was with him all of the way.
