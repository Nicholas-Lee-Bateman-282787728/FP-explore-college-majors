4250934,4,B0042I6528,"The show itself is great. For that alone, I'd give this set 5 stars hands down, even given the show's cancellation and thus ""incompleteness."" The packaging looks nice as well.

However, I have to dock the set a star for its DVD treatment. Firstly, the content is basically the episodes and that's it. Nothing else.

The menus... What menus? It's literally just a blue screen with something like Warner Classics Archive at the top and two options: Play All and Episodes, nothing else. No language or subtitle selections. No special features, no trailers for this or other shows.

Lastly, MOD. Manufacture-on-Demand... I'm beginning to dislike MOD, for its incompatibility with my main DVD player.

The first player I played it in, played the opening credits fine. After that, it gets about 1-2 minutes into an episode and then starts ""pausing"" (for lack of a better descriptor) ever 5-15 seconds throughout a given episode. There's no way I could ever watch an episode like that. It's like literally in mid-sentence the picture just stops for several seconds then picks up again, and a few seconds later in stops for a few seconds and starts again. I eventually just had to turn it off...

After I ""played"" it (and I use the term loosely) in the main player I shoved it into my little portable DVD player and it played fine, without issues. So, I have to assume it's the way the MOD process works. I assume it's burned media that's not widely compatible with some large swath of DVD players. So, be warned, if you only have a single DVD player, and it's an older player, these discs MIGHT NOT play properly on your player. If your player is newer, especially if it supports all the newer burned media types like DVD +/- R/RW, it should hopefully play okay (unless some of the discs are just defective).

But, once you get past the technical challenges and the fact there's nothing in terms of bonus materials, it's a really great classic cartoon series. I just wish it was ""finished."" Maybe some day they'll do a mini-series to tie up the loose ends, or some kind of motion comic special feature(s) on future releases to tell the last bits of the story.

If you like this show, you might want to also check out one of its contemporaries:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exosquad/dp/B001OD8E2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exosquad</a>. Very different show, but equally great cartoon. One of my other prime favorites from my youth.

One other note is on the current price ~$32 as of this review. I'm not sure why the price is so high. Amazon claims the MSRP is around $39.99, but the show is available online directly from WB for a seemingly regular price $29.95, belying Amazon's MSRP. I've forwarded the lower price to Amazon, but so far they haven't changed their list price. I still ordered it from Amazon 'cause I was ordering some other stuff anyway and the price difference wasn't *SO* huge that I couldn't afford it. And the show is worth the price regardless. Though, I don't think I'd pay any more than that based on the current lack of special features and the iffiness of MOD disc compatibility with older players, etc.",1301529600,11,3170,4.857407407407408
4250935,5,B0042I6528,"The 80s and 90s were an exquisite decade for cartoons. We had alot of action cartoons which, in my opinion, are better then humor cartoons. Both decades were a new golden age for cartoons.

Pirates of Dark Water is a sci-fi/fantasy animated series debuting in 1991 on the Fox Kids network. Pirates of Dark Water takes place on a planet called Mer which is in danger of being consumed by dark water, an evil substance created by a satanic being called the Dark Dweller. Only Ren, a young prince can stop it by finding the lost thirteen Treasures of Rule. Ren and his friends Niddler, a monkey-bird, Ioz, a pirate, and Tula, an ecomancer set out to find the treasures and save Mer while sailing on their ship, the Wraith. However they are pursued by the evil pirate-lord Bloth who wants the treasures and use them to control dark water.

One of my all time favorite shows, Pirates of Dark Water is a great show. But the show came to an end too early. Due to expensive production costs and failing to meet the airdates, the series was never completed, ending abruptly after 21 episodes with only eight of the thirteen treasures collected.

Here are the episodes:

1. The Quest-A prince named Ren rescues an old man from the sea and learns that he is his father, King Primus. Before dying, the old man tells him to seek out the 13 Treasure of Rule to save Mer. Ren is then kidnapped by Bloth who was responsible for death of King Primus, but he is later rescued by Niddler, a monkey-bird. Ren learns of his father's mystical quest to save their homeland, ""recruits"" a somewhat unlikely crew, finds the first of the legendary Thirteen Treasures of Rule, and is on his way.

2. Dishonor-Ren directs the ship into the cavernous island of the Atani to escape Bloth and his pirates, and Ioz and Tula display their ""shady"" natures by pilfering some of the Atani's wealth and knowledge in the form of gold and library scrolls, while Konk gets away with the Compass and the First Treasure of Rule.

3. Breakup-Ren and his friends while pursuing Konk, arrive on on island where monkey-birds are sold as slaves. Niddler who was once a slave himself suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ren and his friends free the monkey-birds and their queen from slavery. During the salve revolt, Ren and Niddler are separated from their friends and are kidnapped by Bloth.

4. Betrayal.-Ren meets one of his father's aides, a woman named Avagon, among Bloth's other prisoners. Ioz and Tula chase Konk to Janda-town and reacquire the Compass and First Treasure with the help of Ioz's friend Zoolie, but Tula demonstrates that she has her own agenda and steals them, taking them to Bloth.

5. Victory-Ren realizes his quest is more meaningful than he first thought, and he and Niddler discover the reason for Tula's treachery. The three reunite with Ioz during a prisoner revolt among the Maelstrom, coming away with the first two Treasures, the Compass, more knowledge of the Dark Water, and a strong sense of unity.

6. Andorus-Tula learns that she has enchanted powers. She is an ecomancer, an enchantress who can commune with plant and wildlife. She learns of her homeland of Andorus and restores it to life and helps Ren find the third Treasure of Rule.

7. A Drop of Darkness-While recovering the fourth treasure, Ren and his friends rescue and old woman who had a romantic interest with his father. She attempts to restore her youth so she can get back what she lost with King Primus through his son.

8. The Beast and the Bell-Ren receives a vision from his father's spirit who tells to ring the Bell of the First Sound to stop the Dark Water. He rings the bell but only to free Korruptus, a demon who started the scourge of Dark Water. Ren and his friends must find a way to trap the demon before he can steal the treasures.

9. Panacea-Ren and his friends arrive  on the island of island of Myragon to find the fifth treasure. They meet a biotransmuter named Slaggon. He offers them a creature named Roulette who'll help them find the treasure but things aren't what they seem.

10. King Niddler-Ren and his friends, while searching for the sixth treasure, arrive at an island surrounded by acidic fog. There, they meet wingless monkey-birds who believe Niddler is their king because of his wings.

11. The Collection-Ioz runs into old foes when the crew's resting in Janda-town, and all come into contact with a wizard who shrinks ships and transports them into bottles in his lab, where he can steal their treasures for himself.

12. Little Leviathan-Ren and his friends rescue a baby leviathan from dark water. It takes a liking to Ren and his friends. Ren, Ioz and the baby leviathan are soon captured by Bloth and forces them to find the seventh treasure. Ren and his friends are later rescued by leviathans who happend to be Baby's pod.

13. The Dark Dweller-A celebration of reaching the halfway point of the Quest is interrupted by the Maelstrom, and when Bloth gives chase, Tula falls into the Dark Water. Ren journeys into the den of the Dark Dweller with Niddler to save her, and the heroes fight their first major battle against the lord of the Dark Water.

14. The Dark Disciples-Ren and his friends return to his city of Octopan only to find it in ruins. They meet Morpho and his followers who want the treasures. With the seven treasures, Ren defeats Morpho and restores Octopan.

15. The Ghost Pirates. The crew come across a ghost ship which is being controlled by a female captain. They capture Ioz and Ren and his friends must save him before he becomes a ghost forever.

16. The Dagron Master-During a storm, Ren and Niddler are separated from their friends and are washed upon an island. They meet a man who breeds and sells dagrons to would-be buyers. He tricks Ren into wearing an armor that turns him into a dagron and he is sold to Bloth.

17. The Game Players of Undaar-The Wraith and Maelstrom are captured by two froglike Game Players, who issue Ren and Bloth an ultimatum: they must work together to beat the Game Players' challenging and dangerous game, and if they win, they'll be set free. If they refuse to play or lose the game, they and their friends will die.

18. The Pandawa Plague-Jargis the slave-master of monkey-birds is back and he has infected monkey-birds with an artificial plague that turns them into his mindless slaves. Ren and his friends along with the monkey-bird queen set out to save the infected monkey-birds and the egg that will hatch the future monkey-bird queen.

19. Sister of the Sword-During a stopover in a port city, Ren runs into a fiesty and troublemaking thief of a girl, who ends up being Ioz's younger sister Solia.

20. The Soul Stealer-Bloth and his new ally Morpho concoct a soul-switching potion and use it to swap souls with Ren and Niddler. Meanwhile, Joat, the original owner of the Wraith, comes in pursuit of Ren and Ioz, who stole his ship at the start of the quest.

21. The Living Treasure-Ren and his friends find the 8th treasure, it's a living being, a rabbit-like creature. Ren and his friends must capture it while avoiding vicious amazon women on the island.",1300752000,9,7134,4.665338645418327
4250936,4,B0042I6528,"This is another made-to-order, bare bones (no special features) release from the ""Warner Brothers Archive Collection."" Again, the production material looks like a VHS (but a crisp, clean VHS). However, it is the closest effort that I have seen of the few collections that I have viewed to getting the end of episode bumper right; this collection utilizes the ""swirling star"" (sans ""Taft entertainment"" byline) and replaces the sound effects with what remains of the end theme.

""The Pirates of Dark Water"" ran on Saturday mornings in the early '90s on ABC as Hanna-Barbera's last true action cartoon before Turner and company delved into the politically-motivated ""Captain Planet"" or the nauseatingly pointless ""2 Stupid Dogs"" (or, worse yet, the ""Cartoon Cartoons."") I digress. ""Pirates"" casts our unlikely heroes on high-seas adventures in search of the lost thirteen treasures of their home world to save it from the ""Dark Waters."" Forever at their backs, however, was the honey-sweet voiced pirate lord, Bloth, and his witless band of pirates. This is just me, but I'm guessing that Bloth won a few battles; only eight of thirteen treasures were found by Ren and company before the series was pulled from its time slot. More on this later.

The series was well animated, the score was catchy, and the characters were well plotted out (Ioz, though being a thief who first joins up for personal gain, proves to be a valuable ally on several occasions, and the dynamic between him and Tula, though a bit overplayed by the end of the series, may have been sort of cliche but it was initially sort of entertaining).

Unfortunately, I fear that poor viewership might have gotten in the way of something great. The series ran for one whole season of thirteen episodes and a second partial-season of eight episodes before being mercifully lifted from ABC's Saturday morning timeslot and, to reference a favorite punishment of Bloth's, tossed to the Constrictous.

Oddly enough, to review these episodes again, I'm reminded of another of Hanna-Barbera's overlooked, slightly blemished gems, ""Galtar and the Golden Lance."" Ren, the hero in ""Pirates,"" almost resembles Galtar, whilst his major antagonist, Bloth (between his mismatched eyes, the beard, down to the voice) almost resembles Galtar's nemesis, Tormak. Also, the fact that each episode actually flows well into the next draws a certain parallel for me, though I could be mistaken.

Anyway, a great series and I applaud the Warners for answering the calls of cult fans to release this and several hands full of other series' to DVD through their website at reasonable prices.",1295308800,,2629,5.090487238979119

4250940,4,B0042I6528,"""The Pirates of Dark Water"" is a wonderful cartoon series from the 1990s.  A fantasy world is endangered and dying; only one man can save it.  Humanoids and monstrous creatures abound.  The character designs have a distinct Arabian or Sinbad feel to them.  The protagonists are not a typical do-gooders; for example, they stole their sailing ship in the first episode.  And (minor) characters do perish.  The animation is typical Hanna-Barbera fare, but the voice acting is distinctive and includes Tim Curry and the woman who voiced the Little Mermaid.  The content is 4 or 5-star content and very enjoyable.

After so many years of VHS tapes, illegal downloads, and streaming video, this series was finally released on DVD by Warner Brothers in 2010.  It is a burn-on-demand product, so it should remain in-print for a long time to come.  However, the audio and video have not been remastered for this DVD.  No extras have been added either.

4250993,3,B0042I6528,"The show is fantastic! I grew up watching it and have three copies of the comic book series! I also have the store bought VHS movie edition and home recordings of the series. It's sad to say that my home recordings are in perfect condition without any audio or video problems and with a sharper image and no cut scenes. These DVDs have hiccups and glitches all through them. The worst was during the episode when they were trying to help save the egg of the queen monkey bird. You just couldn't watch that ep. I had amazon replace the dvds three times. Same issues on each disk at the same spots. These disk also have a few 'cut' episodes because there are scenes on my vhs tapes that are not on the dvds. Then again, I have the Canadian release on vhs, same goes for JEM. The point of getting the dvd to was toss out my vhs tapes, but after seeing this, no way! I'm hesitant to buy print on demand stuff. My experience is they are never remastered. My vhs tends to be better quality, and reports of bad disks are rising. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this release seeing as it holds special meaning for my family. Reboot is another set I'm dieing to own. New reviews indicate they finally fixed the issues with those so I'm about to order. We'll see. Hope they fix this one, I'd like a free replacement.

I was quivering with anticipation as the first disc slid ever so gracefully into my DVD player. As the theme song came to a screaming crescendo I could only grip on to my LaZBoy and projectile vomit through my living room and into my neighbors meat loaf. The art style in this cartoon will make your eyes melt out of your head and the sound production will make a Saber tooth attack cat purr.

From the get go when you put the disc in you have a the ability to watch one or all episodes at once, the video quality is VERY good for what you pay and the sound is superb and shows no signs of degradation.  This is how you remember it on Saturday mornings as a kid sitting in your jammies eating cinnamon toast crunch.  The gang is all here with the much beloved characters coming back to hit you with a nostalgic hurricane of memories and more then once you will find yourself muttering or voicing your favorite lines.

Unfortunately, the product offered is not all that great. This is one of the manufactured-on-demand offerings from the WB Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection. What this boils down to is a bare bones release with no special features and low quality menu design.

This is the best you will get of this show because I don't think they will ever fully release it but that's ok because this is actually a good product. My only complaints of this is one the show just cuts off because it was canceled and they never got to finish the story and 2nd the animation quality is amazing for the first couple episodes then just drops. I dunno if the animators were getting lazy or what but the quality is not nearly as good as it was in the first episodes.

Here is where the review turns negative... The barebones nature of the DVD set made me somewhat upset considering the set costs over $20. Also, one of the discs has an error that causes an entire episode to freeze. I was extremely disappointed with this disc defect considering I bought the set New.

The content/show is great for nostalgia purposes, and has potential to capture new fans, but the DVD quality is well below par.",1338595200,16,696,4.650406504065041
4251058,4,B0042I6528,"I loved this show from the moment I first saw it over fifteen years ago.  The characters were well designed and their looks and outfits were cool.  And the storyline was neat, too.  Now, when I see it again, I still think that.  The acting was very good for an early 90s show.  The story flowed and there was action where it needed to be, but I do think it was cut short, too soon.  It's a shame that good shows like this and the Legend of Zelda couldn't be finished, yet you have pointless shows like Naruto that keep going and going and going...  If Ren and Ioz and Tula and their quest was real, I'd join them for sure. As for the quality of the DVDs, I have read one person's comment on here that warned of a bootleg being sold by Standing Ovations on Amazon, but then I looked at the actual Warner Bros. site and read a review from a buyer on there who said their set was done in DVD-R (disc will have a blue back), which could easily make it look like a bootleg, as many bootleg sets are done in DVD-R, but it it was bought directly from Warner Bros., then that is just the kind of discs they decided to use. Though, I wish they had spared a little more expense and chose a better quality disc.  As for the episode quality, you will basically get VHS quality.  There are a few episodes where there may be a line running through the screen or the animation was a bit jumpy.  Unfortunately, it seems Warner Bros. didn't want to spend a big budget trying to revamp the episodes a bit, so this is the best we get.  But it is better to see the show this way then not at all!",1337126400,3,1575,4.0811688311688314

Unfortunately the DVDs are unwatchable.  The First Disc is stuck playing an infinite loop of the anti-piracy message and the few episodes that can be watched are jumpy and glitched.
I am very disappointed that this entire set is unwatchable.  I do not know how a professional Media company can produce and ship a product this far gone.  10 seconds of quality control could have prevented this.

4251061,1,B0042I6528,"Disc 1 of this dvd set is defected. Once the dvd was in, the Piracy warning came up and never went away. I managed to bypass it with a bit of button finagling. It skipped into the middle of an episode. While it plays, the film hiccups every few seconds continuously. It is impossible to watch the episodes on this disc. The other discs play well aside from a sparse few glitches that crop up here and there.  POS dvds, Warner Bros. POS.

The show itself is still entertaining from what I've been able to watch. It deserves a better dvd treatment.",1326931200,39,546,4.3431372549019605

4251063,4,B0042I6528,"Classic show finally on DVD!!!!!!  Ranks up there with Jonny Quest.  I think it was a huge mistake for Hanna-Barbera/Warner Brothers to not finish the show.  It had a great storyline and characters, and there were 5 treasures left to find!!!!!

The only problem I found with this edition was two minor digital glitches, one on disc 2 in the beginning episode, and on disc 4, in the second episode.  Each only last a few seconds, and you do not really miss any action or lines - more an annoyance than any real problem.",1315008000,2,518,4.468085106382978
4251064,4,B0042I6528,"The alien world of Mer is easily one of the most interesting worlds in cartoon history, be that in culture, fauna and the few hints of language we stumble across as a form of censorship ('Noy jitat!') while the rest is rendered in English for our convenience. The Pirates of Dark Water series uses this world as a backdrop. The plot of the series itself is not that great or innovative (Sealed Evil In A Can escapes and needs to be trapped with the help of thirteen magical trinkets in an epic Fetch Quest), but the world it's set in truly makes it shine, and the deliberately flawed characters make it all the more enjoyable.

As children, we watched Pirates of Dark Water and found it phenomenal - less because of what we saw on-screen... and so much more because of what we were almost forced to imagine off-screen, a richly textured world that the show itself only offered a glimpse of. As adults, I daresay that's still the same appeal. Mer is just beautiful, and I yearn to see it revisited in some canon way, unlikely as that may be.

Each episode is written by a different combination of authors, and it shows; some episodes will make you cringe at the bad writing (personally I'm much happier pretending the Dark Dweller doesn't exist, and I know I'm not alone with that assessment), whereas others have you holding your breath as they suck you in. My personal favourites are 'The Collection' and 'The Game Players Of Undaar', and of course the five-episode mini-series that served as a pilot, which (in a way unfortunately) were the most intense crash-course into the Merian backdrop (later episodes show few to no new Merian concepts), but your mileage will almost without a doubt vary.

The DVD set has a crisp image quality, but is unfortunately rather barebones - no extras, not even a fancy themed menu, just a WB episode selection. For me, that suffices entirely - and these four DVDs have made for an absolute awesome trip down memory lane.",1314748800,6,1957,4.63400576368876

4251067,4,B0042I6528,"This is truely an amazing show by Hannah Barbara from the good ol' days of 1991.

The premise is as follows: on the alien world of Mer, an evil and sentient tar-like substance known as Dark Water is threatening to envelop the entire planet, killing everyone and everything. 17 years prior to the show's start, King Primus of Octopon, the largest and most beautiful kingdom on Mer, sets out with his loyal captains to retrieve the lost Thirteen Treasures of Rule. These jewels are the only thing that can contain the Dark Water in Mer's center, where it originates.

After retrieving several of the Treasures, Primus is captured by the terrible Lord Bloth, a pirate intent on taking the Treasures for himself so HE can control the Dark Water. The rest of Primus' crew evade capture and scatter the Treasures around Mer so Bloth can't get them.

After 17 years of imprisonment aboard Bloth's massive ship, the Maelstrom, Primus escapes and manages to return to Octopon, left in ruins by Bloth and the ravages of the Dark Water. Our protagonist, Ren, a simple lighthouse keeper, spots Primus trying to swim ashore and dashes out to rescue him. Now an old and frail man after almost two decades imprisonment, Primus uses the last of his strength to tell Ren he is his father. He shows Ren a vision of a restored Octopon, and passes onto Prince Ren the Quest before dying and washing out to sea.

As young Prince Ren is to discover, not just Octopon, but all of Mer depends on him recovering the Thirteen Treasures of Rule.

And so begins one of the greatest epics ever put on TV. No doubt borrowing from countless sources, the story, characters,
exotic locals keep the story fresh and entertaining. The only reason the DVD pack gets one less star is for the fact the series was never finished, and for some minor transfer issues. Nothing major. Also this is a bare bones DVD. No commentaries, no behind the scenes, nothing. Just the episodes, which is good enough.",1303689600,24,1960,4.6695652173913045
4251068,4,B0042I6528,"I always enjoy a trip down memory lane. The action cartoons of Hanna Barberra have always been a good mix for both children and adults. I first watched this cartoon when I was a teenager. This cartoon inspires the childhood facination with pirates on the high seas and mixes in an alien world with fantastic creatures and places. Anyone who enjoys a good adventure and wants their imagination inspired, will enjoy these cartoons and most of the action cartoons from Hanna Barbara. I rate this one up there with Thundarr the Barbarian and Galtar and the Golden Lance.",1302739200,,566,4.785714285714286
4251069,5,B0042I6528,"This is THE last great ""saturday morning cartoon"" ever made, in my opinion. It might be that I was quite old when this came out (20) and I lost interest in ""kids"" cartoons after that, but none later on ever lived up to the greatness of The Pirates Of Dark Water. It had quite a dark and sinister tone for a Saturday morning cartoon, and those watercolor animations still hold up well to this day. Seriously, there are a ton of American cartoons made in 2011 that don't have as good of animation as this show did. Also, in contrast to many cartoons of its time, there was some actual violence where the consequence was obviously death. No hitting an enemy once and having him/her just lay there knocked out. Nope. sometimes people obviously died. I have waited since the DVD format first came out to get this show on DVD and finally it's here. The visuals are nice... I wouldn't say that it looks like they remastered it or anything, but I'd say the quality is close to what you'd expect form watching a brand new VHS tape. And honestly, seeing as though this is a 2 decade old show, it's way better looking than I thought it would be. I see Amazon is out of stock of this, which makes no sense because it's ""Made on demand"", but beg or plead for them to get it in if you're a fan of the show, it's worth it,",1301616000,5,1307,4.253012048192771

8413720,5,B0042I6528,"I heard of this show back in the day, but never had the chance to actually watch it, until now.  The story of the show is well written, mature, and engaging with some swashbuckling action, memorable characters, imaginative worlds and creatures and some good themes as well.  Tragically, we'll never get the complete story, but this is as good as it gets.  Had this show gained more fans during its initial run, maybe it would have been completed and received the attention and respect this series rightfully deserved.  Oh well, at least we get 21 good episodes, none of which disappoint!  Ren is a cool protagonist and so are his friends Tula, Ioz, and the loveable Niddler the monkey-bird.  The cast is great, Brock Peters has the time of his life playing Bloth the head pirate, Tim Curry is deliciously despicable as Konk, Peter Cullen of Transformers fame (Optimus Prime) does a good job as Mantus, Jodi Benson (best known as the mermaid Ariel) is great as Tula the ecomancer and finally George Newbern of Father of the Bride fame adds some coolness and pathos to the main protagonist Ren.  Overall a good, underrated show for the whole family!

Parental Advisory:  As usual for a pirate show there's some mild violence though some of the protagonists due get injured at times (not from weapons but creatures, though thankfully there's no blood).  There's some chaste flirting at times between Ren and Tula, and Tula from episode 6 to the end wears a midriff baring outfit (think Princess Jasmine in pink).  Finally there are some dark moments that would require parental supervision.  Ren loses his father in the first episode, one character's face melts in one episode, and some villains are frightening from Bloth himself to the Dark Dweller in two episodes, but the most disturbing foe is Morpho, a disciple of the Dark Dweller whose face is half-human half-razor tooth fish.",1501372800,7,1882,4.846875
