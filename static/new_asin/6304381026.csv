7869055,4,6304381026,"Great movie but in the version I saw originally it was very hard to read the translation, especially in the early scenes that had a white, snowy background. All translated movies should be letterboxed with the translation a light color against the background of black. Not all of us are conversant in French. That's the only thing preventing me from giving it five stars--it's that delightful and unusual",1182124800,,404,4.955882352941177
7869056,5,6304381026,"How does a crotchety old zoo director tell his grand-daughter that her father is dead? He doesn't. Instead he tells her this delightful story of her father being a heroic resistence fighter. Fill her with these fantasies when you know they are not true but you want to spare the child the evil of war.
  The Green House takes us to the waning days of WWII in France where an old man delights in fantasies even though he knows they are lies to cover his son's as well as his inadequecies. The two of them are cowards you see.
  This delightful picture will make you laugh, cry and see the changes of a man who comes to terms with the loss of his son and the birth of a new sense of courage in dealing with the Nazis. You will delight in the old man's antics along with his grand-daughter of eight years old who leads the way. Set before us is a story of love, courage and commitment that binds a family together in the midst of tragedy. Green House is an excellent film for family viewing and is a must buy for your film library.",973123200,5,1028,4.2030456852791875
