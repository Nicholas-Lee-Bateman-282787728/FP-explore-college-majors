2533226,4,B000ERVJJ0,"Misunderstood or just a god with a nasty sense of humor either way Q (the marvelous John de Lancie)was one of the highlights of ""The Next Generation"" and was such a good character that he was seamlessly incorporated into two other series. If this follows the course set with the other releases, we'll see probably 12 episodes. Here's the episode listing for each Q appearence as well the series it was drawn from.

 The best of Q, however, truly is in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". In ""Encounter at Farpoint Parts 1 & 2"" Q puts humanity on trial for its arrogance and destructiveness. The Enterprise crew has one chance to redeem themselves--they must figure out a mystery involving ""Farpoint"" a station for the Federation that comes under attack by a mysterious alien race. The pilot also features a cameo by the late DeForest Kelley as Admiral McCoy in an amusing scene with Data.

The first season of ""The Next Generation"" was wildly uneven with some truly bad episodes alternating with some extremely good ones. ""Hide & Q"" straddles the line between these two extremes. While not the best it does offer de Lancie the chance to chew some scenery. Called in to help a mining colory, Q sets a test for Riker--he gives him the power of the Q and tempts him to use it to save his crewmates. In ""Q Who"" an enraged Q flings the Enterprise across the galaxy to test the crew against a new race they've never dealt with before--the Borg.

The third season featured two Q for the price of one. In ""Deja Q"" Q has been stripped of his power and made into a mortal. Q must prove his worth both to the Enterprise and to his the other Q (including Corbin Bernsen in a cameo as another member of the Q). This episode includes a text commentary.

""Q-Pid"" brings together the Enterprise crew and Q in a reenactment of Robin Hood with Captain Picard as Robin Hood and Q as the Sheriff of Notthingham. ""True Q"" is a so-so episode in which an honor student on the Enterprise realizes she's a member of the Q Continuum. Q comes to claim her but she is torn between her humanity and going to the Q Continuum. When Picard is killed in a terrorist attack in ""Tapestry""he finds himself in limbo with Q claiming to be God. Q feels bad for Picard and allows him to revisit a moment in his past. It was evidently inspired by a pitch for an episode called ""A Q Carol"" a variation on ""A Christmas Carol"".

Finally we get the conclusion episode of the series ""All Good Things Parts 1 & 2"" in which Picard discovers that the universe is about to end and its all his fault. Picard whisks back and forth in time with Q providing him clues as to why he's responsible for the end of humanity but refusing to provide him with the solution.

The ""DS9"" episode ""Q-Less"" is the only episode from the series featuring Q and it's quite a good one with a highlight being a boxing match between Commander Sisko and Q in which Sisko knocks Q out (""Picard never hit me!""). Finally from ""Voyager"" we get ""Deathwish"" in which a member of the Q Continuum wants to die and Captain Janeway is chosen as the judge in the case while Q presents the arguement against allowing a member of his race to die. This episode includes another text commentary. This episode actually appears on disc two as it takes place before ""Tapestry"".

""The Q & The Grey"" the Q are in the middle of a civil war and Q transports the Voyager crew to his continuum chosing to make it appear symbolically as America during its own Civil war. In his final appearence as Q de Lancie appears to the Voyager crew and dumps his adolescent son Q2 (also the title of the episode(Keegan de Lancie)on the Voyager crew to deal with. Evidently the boy is bringing chaos to the Q continuum and the Continuum has indicated that Q must straighten the boy out. Q believes that Starfleet ideals might serve the youth and do the job.

As someone else pointed out this set would have worked well with the inclusion of ""The Squire of Gothos"" since the character of Trelane was an inspiration for the character of Q in ""The Next Generation"". Unfortunately it's not included with the set. I'm not sure if it wasn't presented as an option for this set or if it was just overlooked. It's a pity as it would have fit in quite well with this set.

Are these sets worthwhile for fans who own the entire run of ""TNG"", ""Voyager"" and ""DS9""? Probably not but if you have a couple of seasons of one series or don't have all the Trek incarnations this is a pretty good set to have. Paramount has added three text commentary tracks to this set which is a nice plus since there weren't any on the original ""Next Gen"" or ""DS9"" sets.",1143331200,113,4625,4.411488862837046
2533227,4,B000ERVJJ0,"The Star Trek Fan Collectvive DVDs are great for fans who don't want to spend $80 - $120 for each season DVD set. And for those out there who have the entire TNG and DS9 collections (and maybe even VOY, ENT and TOS), it's probably not worth getting these sets as they pretty much feature the episodes with the same audio and video transfer quality.

For the Q DVD set, here is an interesting episode to include from The Original Series:

The Squire Of Gothos

It has been insinuated in a number of circles that the featured character in this episode, Trelane, is an ancestor of Q. Plus, he has been featured as such in the TNG novel ""Q-Squared"".

Just a thought...

2533231,5,B000ERVJJ0,"A must for any major fan of ""Star Trek"" like myself.  Back in 1994 I had the honor and unique chance to run into actor John Delance who played ""Q"" on Star Trek the Next Generation, and he was just as awesome in person as he is on TV and in movies. He was charming, fun, sweet, sharp, and very embracing toward the fans.  This Philly native actor is one of the absolute bests at what he does, and playing the role of ""Q"" the super cosmic galactic genie of the Star Trek universe is by far in my view was his best part.

 ""Q"" is interestingly both a villain and a good guy at the same time unlike other movie or tv villains, & his intergalactic adventures menacing Patrick Stewart and the crew of TNG are some of the most enjoyable and best episodes of the series.

 ""Q"" is a magical being who has vast powers and can summon anything he desires like a genie from Aladdin's lamp.  His power is a danger and a major headache for the Enterprise crew, as he whips up some ordeal the crew must desperately try to out smart themselves out of.

Tormenting them, even killing them in some points, don't make the mistake that Q can be trusted. Yet he leads to golden moments of philosophical debates and hilarity. And here are all the episodes he's appeared in. Limited to around....12 or so...he doesn't get much but when he is in, he makes one hell of an impact. A big child or a wise ancient being....both.

2533260,5,B000ERVJJ0,"I absolutely loved this collection because I liked both the Q character and John de Lancie's brilliant portrayal.  From the first appearance in ""Encounter at Far Point"" to the last in ""Q2"", we see Q not only interact with different vessels, their captains and their crews in delicious thrust and parry, but we also see Q himself evolve.  The Q who holds humanity in contempt and derision on his first appearance grows to appreciate that this race is really a diamond in the rough, that it can teach even his people valuable lessons about the real meaning of life and existence.

Q isn't the alien one typically encounters in the Star Trek universe.  As Star Trek's writers knew very well, no matter how dazzling the technical effects, no matter how snazzy the costumes, sets, and props were, if the audience didn't care about the characters then the whole viewing experience was a waste of time.  Whenever Q makes an appearance, the audience is instantly engaged because he is so totally human: arrogant, cruel, vindictive, self-centered, and given to doubt on some occasions, while at other times moved to express generosity, gratitude, affection and even altruism.  Whether he is engaged in verbal jousts with Jean-Luc Picard, Katherine Janeway, and Benjamin Sisko or interacting with Geordie LaForge, Tom Paris and Vash, Q was always interesting to watch.  You found yourself both laughing with him and at him.

If you own no other special Star Trek collection, you should have this one.  This is a wonderful example of character development by the writers and its splendid portrayal by John de Lancie.  This is fine writing and acting in one package, and best of all, you don't have to be a Star Trek or even a science-fiction fan to appreciate its outstanding quality.",1340150400,,1773,4.8996655518394645

2533265,4,B000ERVJJ0,"I agree with earlier reviewers about how great these are, but there are some problems.

First, it doesn't include the sixth volume in the series, ""Alternate Realities"".  With only six volumes ever made, a set that includes five is needlessly incomplete.

Second, I paid less for all six volumes individually at Walmart when they first came out than Amazon is charging for this set, so I can't see it as much of a bargain.

Third, too much duplication.  Yes, there are some episodes that fit into more than one of these categories.  That doesn't mean they had to be included in each of them, at the expense of other episodes.

Fourth, a few of the episode selections.  Darmok?  Really??  DARMOK?!?!  Could they have found a more flawed episode?

2533269,3,B000ERVJJ0,"Of all the bizarre, dramatic, engaging, and, well,...bizarre story-telling within the Trek universe, the Q episodes were the most memorable. Q was the character that allowed the writers the most room for real creativity, in my opinion. Q visitations usually gave rise to the best dialogue and situational humor, which may not have been the primary thing trekkies were looking for in Trek, but loads of fun, nonetheless. This dvd collection is full of the best the franchise has to offer in that arena.

John DeLancie, who plays Q, is the best, most subtle actor ever to show his face on the bridge of the Enterprise, and it's just pure fun to watch him portray the unpredictable, unquantifiable Q.

The Q episodes, in perhaps more purely Trek fashion, also offered the opportunity to explore some thought-provoking questions about the meaning of being human, civilized, and evolved. Of course, this was a t.v. series, so the writing mostly sort of waded in the shallow end of some very deep pools. It's enough dark water, however, to make these episodes watchable by an audience outside the fan collective.

If you like Star Trek, this is probably the collection to own. If you love Star Trek, you're going to go for them all anyway...",1260489600,3,1235,4.843601895734597
2533270,5,B000ERVJJ0,"As Star Trek TNG fans know, Q has been one of the most consistently interesting villains in the entire franchise. In each of his episodes, he presents the crew of the Enterprise with a new moral dilemma, making not only for some of the most entertaining shows, but also the most thought provoking. John de Lancie plays the part superbly and combines an arrogance with a certain humor and ruefulness that bring a great sense of comedic relief to Star Trek. It's great to finally have all of the episodes on one disc.

My favorite Q scene: In TNG's ""Tapestry,"" Picard is in bed (hairy chest and all) after what is presumably a night with an attractive young female. A hand from offscreen gently reaches to touch his hair. As Picard turns to look at his partner, the camera pans right to reveal Q in a Starfleet uniform beside Picard, smiling ruefully. Gotta love it!

My only problem is that the discs are not HD quality and don't have much commentary. Hopefully future versions will.

The only detail you need to know about the Q is that they are all-powerful god-like beings but they are in many ways immature.  The episodes here are all of Q's appearances on three different shows.

The first 2 episodes come from TNG's first season, and quite frankly the cast did not gel yet.  Some of the acting is bad.  There are also several things we learn about the Q that would change over the course of the series.  As TNG took off, the performances became more solid.  After a one show stop-over at DS9, Q also appeared on Voyager three times.

I highly recommend it for any Star Trek fan, casual or as intense as our family.",1204761600,6,598,4.409090909090909
2533278,4,B000ERVJJ0,"Star Trek has always been hit or miss.  There are episodes from all the various series that are truly worth watching repeatedly, and others that are very forgettable.  In this collection of Q-related episodes from TNG, DSN, and Voyager, again there's a bit of hit and miss.  But the hits are so good!

Q (played by actor John de Lancie) is an all powerful, all knowing entity from the Continuum.  He appears during the first episode in The Next Generation series, and puts humanity on trial for being a savage, barbaric race.  Captain Picard begs to disagree.

In Deja Q, Q has lost his powers and, even with his omnipotence, he experiences a few things for the first time, particularly pain (back, hunger, and a fork jabbed into his hand).  And how did that one scene go?  ""I'll have 10 hot fudge sundaes... I'm in a really bad mood.""

In Tapestry, Picard is killed.  Is Q God?  Q gives Picard a chance to relive a period from his past, and Picard, for the first time, sincerely thanks Q for his help.  By the way, Picard comes back to life.

My favorite episode (part 1 and 2) from this series is All Good Things, where Q intersects with the new Captain Picard and crew, an experienced Picard and crew, and an older and disbanded Picard and crew.

Note:  If you are not a Trekkie, then consider watching this series with one in the room.  You'll need someone to explain why Seven of Nine is so nonchalant about losing her clothes, why Tasha appears and disappears as chief of security, and what a Betazold can do.

Enjoy.",1195603200,,1523,4.4763636363636365
2533279,4,B000ERVJJ0,"No surprise here, Q was one of my favorite characters. One of the drawbacks of his character is that many of his scenes actually depend on his annoying behavior, and that doesn't stand up as well as more straight drama or comedy. I prefer the more developed Q, once they got past the first few episodes, and before he was more of a wimpy whiner with Janeway. Begging Janeway to have his child? Please.

The Farpoint show could have been much better. Too bad they didn't do it a few years in. Q's scenes could have been more refined, for example, as his touch of evil at that time was more compelling than the drift toward comedy.

""All Good Things"" is one of the best, if you do the usual blocking out of the huge holes in time travel stories and the illogic in the core threat of the thing that ate the galaxy. Picard and Q had such a natural relationship, with Stewart and De Lancie each effective.

""Death Wish"" has always been an excellent concept, perhaps underappreciated. What would you do if you were immortal and omnipotent? Hmm. Really takes ""been there, done that"" to a new level.

""Tapestry"" has Picard as George Bailey and Q as Clarence. Yes, it's a bit of a stretch to conclude that, but Q gives Picard a look at what might have been. One of the best in this collection.

When Q takes the Enterprise to encounter the Borg, that remains chilling, even now. Two of Star Trek's best ideas: Q and the Borg, together.

Paramount has done the right thing with the specialized collections on Picard and Q.",1188518400,,1512,4.44043321299639

I would say if you like Star Trek or know someone who is this is a great purchase.,1188172800,9,356,4.3283582089552235

Q has always been my favorite character and this set offers every episode that he's appeared in: 8 TNG episodes (2 that are two-parters), 1 DS9 episode and the 3 Voyager episodes.  Since there are tons of reviews already that go into the specific episodes, I see no point in doing the same.

While it's great to have all the Q episodes, I personally would have liked a few more special features with the set.  Aside for subtitle commentary by the producers (which was only done for a few episodes), there were no new or special features.  Picky of me, I know, especially considering the price, but a featurette or even a blooper reel would have been fun to watch. The case that holds the discs is nice and compact. I takes the same amount of space as a single disc cover, yet keeps all the discs separate and scratch-free.

Personally, I always felt (and still feel) that we never got quite enough Q from the Star Trek universe; he's a delicious character (John de Lancie plays him so well), and probably a lot of fun to write. But if, like me, you'll take of Q what you can get, I highly recommend this DVD set.

Some episodes in the set have optional extras: commentary written on the lower margin of the screen (but not spoken aloud). If it's been a while since you've seen the episodes, I recommend leaving the commentary off for the first go, as it becomes distracting sometimes (much like audio commentary, really).",1167782400,2,847,4.458064516129032

Episode Title: ""THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS""

Production Number: 18

Original Air Date: 01-12-67

Stardates: 2124.5

Trelane has technology to manipulate matter and energy, and has created an Earthlike environment around his castle on the otherwise uninhabitable planet. He holds the Enterprise crew on the planet for his own amusement, until he is confronted by the disembodied voices of his elders, scolding him for his treatment of his new ""pets."" Trelane is sent away, and his elders allow Captain Kirk and the Enterprise crew to continue on their mission to Colony Beta Six.

by Peter David",1154390400,4,922,4.928571428571429
2533291,4,B000ERVJJ0,"Since his debut in ENCOUNTER AT FARPOINT.  Q has always been a wonderful addition to the Star Trek universe.  Irreverent, powerful, menacing and funny, there is so much to like about Q.  John Delancie crafted the role in Next Gen and then honed it to a razor tip in DS9 and Voyager.  One of my favorite lines in the newer series remains, ""You hit me.  Picard never hit me.""  With Sisko responding, ""I'm not Picard.""

An excellent set, with every Q appearance represented across three series.  Though - as a bonuus episode - I might have included the TOS episode The Squire of Gothos, featuring the Quasi-Q, Trelane.  True enough, he's not Q.  But he is darn close, and there was room on this set.",1152835200,3,696,4.496
2533292,5,B000ERVJJ0,"This is a must have for Trek fans who don't have the episodes on DVD. To put it simply, this is every single episode Q has every appeared in, so you get every episode of Q! This is a dream come true to Q fans that have been waiting for a collection like this to be released. Love or hate him, there is no denying that Q is one of the greatest characters ever created in not just Star Trek but Sci-fi history.

The special features on this collection are not as good as in the previous collectives since you only get text commentaries on a few episodes, but I suppose that is better than nothing. Once again, like in the previous fan collective, there are episodes that are already on the previous collective releases but it doesn't matter in this case since it is all of the Q episodes. Once again, if you already have every season of Trek from every series, you don't need to buy this at all. If you have all the seasons, then you already have every episode on here and you would only be paying money for the box. There are no special features on here that you will die if you don't have. This is for the fans that don't have all of the season and/or want all of the Q episodes all in one package. If you want every single Q episodes all together, this is for you and it is totally worth the money!",1152057600,5,1299,4.134387351778656
2533293,4,B000ERVJJ0,"These lower priced boxed sets are a good way to review all your old favorites from the various trek series. You avoid two of the pitfalls found in the alternative of purchasing all individual seasons: firstly, even at a reduced price, you will end up spending considerably more on individual seasons; secondly, having a bookshelf devoted to startrek is not always socially the wisest course of action. For those who make the leap and fully indulge in their passion for Trek, I make no judgments. Personally, I would like to enjoy my sci-fi fix with a little bit more subtlety than a 28 season marathon in my room and few more dollars in my pocket.

The episodes chosen seem to capture the theme of each boxed set very well, and it would be nice to see a ""Startrek: Classics"" set with no particular theme, just those good episodes that were fun to watch. I like the 'Time Travel' Collection more than the 'Q' and `Borg' collections because the episodes seem to have a little more variety within that theme. The Next Generation episodes present a much broader spectrum of 'Q' and 'time travel' than than the 'Borg' collection manages.

Generally speaking, if I were going to purchase only one of these Fan Collectives, 'Q' would not be it (time travel is the best in my opinion); however, because I am a star trek geek, I bought more than one set, and I am enjoying re-viewing the shows I watched when I was younger.  The 'Q' collection is pretty much self explanitory- every episode deals with the omnipotent being we all love to hate.  So if thats what you want to watch, then this is the collection for you.  If not, then don't buy it.  Don't expect much new, if you've already spent a thousand dollars on all the complete seasons.

I will fault the selections for the overlap that is present in each theme. I'm not positive, but I don't think you can purchase any two sets without re-purchasing at least one episode.",1150588800,9,1918,4.574344023323615
2533294,4,B000ERVJJ0,"I hated Q during TNG's run and avoided all his stories in reruns.  So imagine my surprise when I found myself really enjoying this collection--it probably helped that I hadn't seen the Next Gen eps since they aired and the others not at all.  The character of Q brought something to the next gen Star Treks that they lacked all too often--humor, unattractive character traits, selfishness:  a humanity that other characters lacked sometimes, even though I loved TNG.  Yet thanks to Q, we see a grumpy Worf, a grumpy Geordi, etc.  Q's interactions with the regular cast is fun to watch--though we needed more Q and less Vash in Q-less (though I did like the character of Vash a lot).  Seeing Suzy Plakson again is great, too, in the Q and the Grey, even if it's not a strong episode.  Seeing Q interact with each of the three captains is fun, and the character arc for Q is interesting.  John de Lancie does a really excellent job and he ""gets"" Star Trek as well as anyone.

Encounter at Farpoint and Hide and Q are a bit painful to watch--the cast was overacting so badly that it's a wonder that the show survived the first season--they are interesting for that reason alone. Q was the best thing in both episdoes.  Q-Who is chilling and wonderful, and the Borg were at their best--they lost a bit of their menace with each subsequent appearance.  Deja Q was very, very funny--better than I remembered.  The Q-Geordi and Q-Data interaction is great.  Q-pid is nearly as funny. True  Q is a bit dull, but Tapestry is one of the best ever TNG episodes.  All Good Things is fun if you ignore the plot holes that you can drive a truck through.  As the commentary points out, Q-less, as one of the first DS9 eps, gives a wonderful look at the foundation of the DS-9 characters and watching Q interact with Sisko is great.  I liked the fact that they show the episodes in Q-order with this episode before TNG finale.  The Voyager episodes are the weakest in the lot--but Q stirs things up and brings a liveliness to the proceedings.  By the time I got to them, I was just enjoying John de Lancie without worrying about the stories overly much.  The one-liners and witty observations are evident in all twelve episodes.  Seeing Colm Meany as O'Brien in TNG pilot and then on DS9 seems like a nice bonus, as does having both TNG pilot and finale in one set.

I hadn't really noticed in the other collectives--but there's one text commentary per series so that you get insight into each.",1149984000,24,2478,4.50896860986547

2533296,5,B000ERVJJ0,"I was hoping someone might list the episodes that will be on this collection when they find out. I'm sure it will have the obligatory STTNG episodes. Hey, I kinda enjoyed the Q/voyager storyline.

As for these releases being just another greedy scheme, I cannot agree here. If you already own every Star Trek episode ever made then I doubt the producers really would expect you to buy these collections as well...Imagine though if they were to re-release newer ""special edition"" versions of every season :).",1144022400,6,507,4.895348837209302
2533297,5,B000ERVJJ0,"While it was nice to see seasons 1-3 (so far) of Trek TNG to come down to near-reasonable prices, none of the others have yet to do so... and these hand-picked episode collections fare better for fans who can't afford entire reasons or prefer a theme.

We've already had the Picard set (though ""The Measure of a Man"" also highlights Picard highly, as do a handful of other season 1 and 7 stories...)

The Borg set came out earlier and contains what seems to be all the Borg episodes (14 episodes or 10 stories) - and its price is sublime.

And then we have the time travel episode collection.  Looking at those episodes, they just don't have the impact the other collections have, so I am shocked it is due to come out - long before Q.  (Not that the episode assortment is bad, but only TOS got the time travel aspect right in my opinion, and Q is a heckuvalot more imaginative anyway.)

But back to Q.  As of this writing I am speculating that all the Q stories will be released:

Encounter at Farpoint

Hide and Q

Q-Who?  (also in the Borg collection)

Deja Q

Q-Pid

True Q

Tapestry

All Good Things... (also in the Time Travel collection)

and his various offerings in DS9 and in Voyager too; though if we're all limited to 10 stories, they can nix the DS9 and the worsr Voyager one.  :)

I've also noticed some slight duplications in stories.  ""All Good Things"" being both a Q piece and a time travel one.  And Q-Who being a bit Borgy as well. While the cynic in me would normally disagree, I am not against it this time because some stories do overlap categories, we are not forced to buy extra sets we otherwise don't want (unlike the season released if we only wanted the cliffhanger of a story resolved!), and in those sets it's there so we don't have to swap discs if we want to see that other episode.

Of course, Endgame is a bit of a surprise on the time travel set...  ""Relics"" would have been more apropos.  Scotty travels 80 years into the future...  and maybe because they are mixing themes, they could have allowed this.  Meh, oh well.

I am quite happy with these releases coming out.  I wish Q's was sooner...

And I suspect a Data one will be out later this year.  (Elementary, Dear Data and Ship in a Bottle undoubtedly being two of the episodes, no doubt...)",1143936000,5,2283,4.366666666666666
2533298,1,B000ERVJJ0,"Ok, I understand everyone's opinion about how great this is for someone who doesn't own (or can't afford) the seasons, and I agree. However, for people like me who do own all 28 seasons, 10 ""Special Edition"" movies (that I have already bought twice because I also owned the single disc versions that they released first), this would be an absolute waste of money. In my opinion, Paramount is simply trying to make up for the shortsightedness of canceling Enterprise.

Sure, the first season of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was a slow start and the second season (although better), wasn't much to write home about. The third and forth seasons were not only much better but more along the lines of what true ""Star Trek"" is all about. It showed us history and explanations for things in the Star Trek universe that had never been explained before. Now, I'm sure that because of the serialized nature of the last 2 seasons, the ratings may have fell a little because not everyone owns a DVR and once you miss an episode, and you're lost. Big deal! You can't tell me they didn't sell enough DVD sets to make up for the ratings.

Now, for the first time in years, there is no new Star Trek, and no new income. Not only for Paramount but also probably a lot of the behind the scenes staff as well. In the meantime they are releasing these ""collectives"" in hopes that the die hard fans, like myself, will buy them, because I think I have to own it all. Well not this time! Like I said above, I have already bought the movies twice because they didn't put any specials on the first set. I'm not about to spend money on the same episodes I already own, not to mention the fact that there are episodes that appear on more than one of these ""collectives"".

If Paramount wants to continue the ""Star Trek"" revenue, they should release new material. Unlike a lot of people, I enjoyed ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" and would love to see movies released about Voyager's return to earth, or what happened to Deep Space Nine's people after the war was over, or anything else NEW that Paramount could come up with. Hey, here's an idea, how about we finish some (if not all), of the 6-year gap we left at the end of ""Enterprise"". Come on, Paramount, get it together!",1143849600,8,2231,4.476658476658477
