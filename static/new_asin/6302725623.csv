501474,5,6302725623,"This film is chocka block jampacked full of Spinal Tap-esque performances, spandex and profundities. Whether you're looking for a coked out 'Poison' rambling about how great it is to drive fast cars and wear make up, deluded metalheads (wearing leopard print/ridiculous jewllery/mullets - you choose) insisting that one day they will ""be famous"", or Ozzy Osbourne cookin' up brekkie - this film is the film for you!

An archetype of 1980s excess and silliness Penelope's doco captures the ridiculous nature of the L. A. metal scene circa 1987. Often bordering on self-parody, she places the pompous musings of the likes of Megadeth in between footage of a very drunk Chris Holmes downing 2 litres of vodka in his pool. All this is complemented by sublimely terrible 'gigs' from the film's subjects - oh yeah, and a strip tease/dancing contest hosted by a amphetemine fueled geriatric!

You may have laughed during Spinal Tap when Rob Reiner's 'band' sang numbers like 'Sex Farm Woman' and 'Lick My Love Pump' - well you may laugh even harder after you see 'Odin' onstage jumping about in bumless chaps ...",1092873600,3,1105,4.967567567567568
501475,5,6302725623,"This is about Eighties HEAVY METAL.  .
  This flick interviews up and coming glam bands who made their home in the L.A. scene. Also interviewed are some of the genre's idols including Kiss, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Poison, Megadeth, Lemmy from Motorhead and of course, Ozzy.
  Also, spotlighted performances from bands such as Faster Pussycat, Odin, London (Nikki Sixx's old band), Seduce and Megadeth.
  The movie's range of topics include groupies, alcoholism, drugs, the glam image and why it attracted so many people from many walks of life.
  The movie's funniest (and saddest) segment includes filmmaker Penelope Spheeris's attempt to interview a W.A.S.P. guitarist in his pool, drunk as a skunk and with his MOM sitting right there!
  This was what I grew up on and I still prefer it to grunge or rap-metal. It was feel good music that was more interesting than the current crop of sullen/politcal rock groups that all seem to sound alike.
  For those of you who looked down on this stuff, you might want to check out this documentary with open minds.(Remember those?)C'mon, you know you want to.",1070150400,30,1103,4.961748633879782
501476,3,6302725623,"A must for fans of mondo movies...they oughta retitle this MONDO MORONIC. Dork after dork after dork is paraded before your eyes; the uninitiated will walk away from this having no clue that there is any musical validity to metal whatsoever. (And it's the 80s - so there isn't.) Too bad, as heavy music of the 70s, the 90s and the NWOBHM era of 79-82 has a lot to offer. Tellingly, the first rocker you see in DECLINE PART 2 is metal's very own AntiChrist Gene Simmons, who can't disguise his contempt for the fans or the music no matter how hard he tries. (He doesn't try very hard....you can almost hear the cash register in his head going ka-CHING!) The other names on display (Ozzy, Tyler & Perry, Alice, Lemmy, etc) at least have genuine affection for the scene and the music - you can tell there's still a fan's heart beating in their chests.
Let's hope the Odins and Jaded Ladys on view here didn't end up doing time later on, as these boys are jailhouse date-bait to the nth power. Besides, being captured on film for all time in those ridiculous poodle-mullets is surely punishment enough.",1066176000,4,1098,4.522613065326633

There's also segments with industry vets, Kiss & Aerosmith. My personal favorite moment is Faster Pussycat's performance piece and the segment with Rikki Rachtman and the Cathouse. It's also cool to see a thriving Sunset Strip in it's prime. Unlike the other reviewers, I do enjoy glam and am happy to see somewhat of a resurgence with bands like Robin Black and the Intergalactic Rock Stars and Sugarcult.

501478,5,6302725623,"The 80's LA metal scene. Where the winners rose to the top and the losers died in obscurity. This vid has it all for those who love the hair rock, brain dead, heavy metal 80's.
Highlights include-
1. Ozzy Osbourne interview in his kitchen as he's attempting to make his own breakfast.
2. A drunken Chris Holmes (W.A.S.P.) lounging in his pool slamming straight vodka and tries to conduct an interview while his obviously embarrassed mother looks on.
3. Odin. A band that was going to be the 'next big thing'. Never heard of them? This video is the only place you'll ever hear of them.
4. Lemmy Kilmister, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Steven Tyler, and Joe Perry inputting their own little snips and two cents randomly through out the film.
5. First hand knowledge of what it's like to be in the band 'London'.
6. AN early version of Megadeth and Dave's unique insight.
7. All the bands like 'Seduce' who came to LA to make it big.
And of course the everyday slobs who had to voice their views on everything that is metal. SOme have a brain cell or two while most of them are straight up losers. Also who can forget the 'de-metalizing institute'? A place where parents sent their rocker kids to 'get out of metal'. ...

501521,4,6302725623,"The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (Penelope Spheeris, 1988)

What is truly fascinating about this film is that there's so much more to it than there seems to be. While Spheeris seems to want this to come off as a sort of Errol Morris-liek ""give 'em enough rope"" documentary, the hand of the maker is very much in evidence if you look.

The greatest example of this is the amazing dichotomy between the bands we see interviewed and the bands we see perform. To a one, the interviewed bands (those who don't perform, anyway) have stood the test of time, and are still regarded as good, or great, bands today-- Motorhead, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, etc. The bands we see perform, on the other hand... well, it's embarrassing to admit I actually listened to some of that stuff in 1988, and I can only look back and wonder what on Earth I was thinking buying Faster Pussycat albums. Is it coincidence that all the live footage is godawful, while all the bands without live footage are, well, not? I have my doubts.

Then there's the Chris Holmes interview. (Some might take W. A. S. P. guitarist Holmes as the exception to my rule above. I don't think so-- W. A. S. P. and The Last Command have, at least in my collection, been in sporadic rotation for over two decades.) It sits there like the eight hundred pound elephant in the room in stark contrast to the deluded silliness of the amateurs and the ""oh, man, that lifestyle just sucked when I lived it"" cynicism of the professionals. But I think there's more to it than just stark contrast; Holmes sits alone in his position in the film, guitarist for a band who's actually gotten to the heights all the amateurs are dreaming of, but not yet gone on to icon status. Is he a symbol of what all the amateurs are aspiring to? Is he just another step on the road to icon status? Both of the above? Who knows? It's hard to look at Holmes' interview in any sort of analytical way; it's set up in such a way as to provoke the maximum emotional response, and it succeeds tremendously. It is probably also worth noting that when London, during their interview, rattle off the names of the guys who came through the band and then went on to make it big, one name is conspicuous in its absence-- that of W. A. S. P. lead singer Blackie Lawless. Again, I wonder whether anything in this movie is in any way coincidental.

Seen twenty years later, The Decline of Western Civilization II is a fascinating look into the world of ""what the hell were we thinking?"". Highly recommended for overgrown headbangers who are now deaf, or on their way to it. *** ",1198108800,2,2614,4.471698113207547
501522,5,6302725623,This was a really powerful time in music. My jaw was on the ground the first time I saw it. These guys really were rock stars!,1187049600,,126,3.8846153846153846
501523,5,6302725623,One of the very best movies on metal music by far.  Deserves to be released on dvd...,1171843200,,85,4.0
501524,4,6302725623,"Features interviews with notables in The Heavy Metal genre, fans, groupies, and aspiring musicians, with performances by Odin, Lizzy Borden {still performing}, London {post- Nikki Sixx}, Seduce {who really did possess some talent there}, and Megadeth {before they mega-died}.

Questions range from the plans of the musicians if they are not successful {from what I have seen, most did not - considering their apparent adamance, I wonder how many of them actually became homeless, conformed, became involved in other positions within the music industry, or otherwise died*; among them all. I did recognize Vixen who went on to experience some success with an album}, to the ""satanism"" angle, which was limited {perhaps thankfully} to 'the devil horns' hand gesture, most comically explained by a Christian probation officer as containing the ubiquitous authority of The Devil with the upthrust fingers, and the three pointing down representing the denial of the Christian trinity, also containing '666' within the bend of the fingers - I honestly do not believe any of the 'rockers' and 'metalheads' even considered that more involved Occult symbology, and just lift it in the air as a habit, but was probably first used by Ronnie James Dio as relating to Heavy Metal. She also had quite a collection of confiscated gauntlets, studded fingerless gloves, spiked bracelets, and collars - no doubt plenty of records and tapes as well.

A cleaned-up Steven Tyler & Joe Perry of Aerosmith relate tales of their narcotic excesses, a rehabilitated Ozzy Osbourne has an amusingly pleasant morning chat while preparing breakfast {at one point, he misses a glass almost completely while pouring some orange juice and talking about his own alcoholism and drug use}, Alice Cooper in full makeup on the theatrical set takes umbrage at a certain band for what he feels is unjustified replication, KISS' Gene Simmons offers intelligent and concise commentary on the going-on within the industry, Paul Stanley also offers cohesive commentary amongst a bevy of beauties in bed, Lemmy Kilmeister of Motorhead offers gruff realities overlooking Hollywood, and WASP's {at the time} Chris Holmes drunkenly rambles on about his intoxicated exploits as his poor mother sits poolside, progressively becoming more inebriated with two bottles of Vodka - one can readily perceive his unfortunate mental degeneration.

I thought club owner and sharp dresser Bill Gazzarri had quite a remarkably life-loving attitude, offering great opportunities to many bands who may otherwise would have never seen the spotlight, and initiated salacious events such as dance and strip contests for sexy young ladies. His commercials were heavily circulated on 105.5 KNAC at the time, which was the only Heavy Metal radio station in the L.A. area - now there are none. KNAC DJ Tawn Mastrey was also featured herein.

Ultimately, I feel 'The Decline of Western Civilization part 2: The Metal Years' was an accurate, though somewhat limited documentary of the 80's Metal subculture, although I personally would have liked to have seen interviews with Venom, King Diamond, Possessed, Bathory, Manowar, and Celtic Frost as well. Perhaps there will eventually be a part 4, focusing on these 'dark bands'? It would be interesting, but whether or not they are actual Satanists would be another matter altogether. This film concentrates largely on Hollywood 'pop-metal' and Glam rock.

501525,5,6302725623,"This rocumentary shows the metal era of the 80's. With interviews from bands of the 70's, and 80's, it shows what the metal scene is really about, Energy, Fun, and Being different from everything else and also gives you some insight on the downside of the music industry. If you get a chance to see DWCII TMY, get it, watch it, and see what was so great and fun about the 80's metal scene and find out why todays so called metal is nothing but sound alike downers who don't know what true metal is about (PURE ENERGY + FUN).",1130112000,5,524,4.25
501526,3,6302725623,"I've seen this movie a couple times, and I'm constantly irritated by the fact that people INSIST on calling crap like Poison, motley crue and other glam bands ""metal"", they are rock.... pure and simple.

These chumps wouldn't know metal if it fell from the sky, landed on their faces and started to wiggle. This movie is ONLY about the glam scene in LA and NEVER really represented TRUE metal, the interviews with Lemmy (Of Motorhead) and Dave Mustain (re: megadeth) are the ONLY interviews done from REAL metal bands.

So if you buy this, be forewarned, it does little to show the real metal scene as it truely was. Real metal is not about big hair, mullets, makeup, seeing how drunk and stupid one can get, or spandex (SHUDDER), it's about finding an outlet for aggression and anger, getting a message out that we were tired of the BS people wanted to pump down our throats.

So don't confuse True Metal fans with these transvestite wanna-be's.

501527,5,6302725623,"""The Decline Of Western Civilization Part II:The Metal Years"",is a really interesting look at rock 'n roll. In this documentary,Penelope Spheeris(the girl who directed this)interviews artists/bands from both the 70's AND the 80's,and if you ever wondered what rock 'n roll was like behind the scenes,then this is your place to turn:Rock stars such as Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of KISS,Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith,Poison(the band,just so you don't get confused),Alice Cooper,Ozzy Osbourne,etc. are in this documentary,and you get to learn what it is like if you want to make it into the music industry,things that happen once you have made it into the industry(sex,drugs,etc),what some of the rock stars who are in this did once they had made it succesful,among several other interesting facts and stories. You even see probation officers in this documentary who talk about what happened with some parents once rock 'n roll and heavy metal had become so huge,and musicians who claim that they dropped out of school when they were only in seventh grade and musicians who were wanting to make it big when this documentary was made are also in here-which is why this documentary is so interesting and why it also gives Penelope Spheeris ""two thumbs up"" for doing such a good job at putting this documentary together. Overall,this is a good,interesting tale of rock 'n roll,heavy metal,and decadence,and anyone interested in either one of those things should check this documentary out.",1119398400,3,1497,5.1646090534979425

7830113,2,6302725623,"Firstly the subject was always going to lend itself to having a few morons turn up to talk in front of a camera and plenty of the LA hair scene decided to do so. The bits that annoy me so much are the interviews with the bands themselves. There are a couple of wannabe bands who were not popular in the late 80's and were never going to be (Odin, London). There are also some very famous bands too. What lets down the insight in to these famous bands is the fact that so much of the stuff is clearly set up to make them looks stupid or they are clearly involved. Paul Stanley is just laying on a bed with loads of women. Gene Simmons is in a shop basically scamming on women. Now while this behaviour is expected of Gene Simmons (who clearly a very clever if not amazingly arrogant man) it's clearly something that he is aware of as is Paul Stanley and anyone who knows Kiss, knows that that they'll do anything for money. Ozzy Osbourne has admitted as has the director that the ""Breakfast"" Scene is a set up and the shakes were pretend - somewhat ironically. Chris Holmes - an Alcoholic - is given Vodka and then filmed. It's also worth noting that Ozzy and Sharon filmed another documentary with Spheris in 2002 and that she wrote the foreword in the Megadeth front man's (Dave Mustaine) autobiography.  Also both Simmons and Osbourne were making films at the time and Poison front man Bret Michaels has stated that he would love to be an actor and has his own production company with Charlie Sheen.

The film has an agenda which was to show how stupid many of the people who liked the hair metal scene were. It achieves that but when you look into the fact that several of the people involved wanted to get into movies and acting as well her later credits it makes me think that this is a bit like a poor man's Spinal Tap using some famous people sadly rather than being funny it's just cringeworthy.
