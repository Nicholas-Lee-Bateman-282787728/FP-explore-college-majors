Released in 1960, THE HAND is the strange tale of three comrades who are captured and tortured during World War II.  Fifteen years later a down-on-his luck London man is found dead with one of his hands amputatedand the doctor who performed the surgery has committed suicide.  Inspector Munyard (Ronald Leigh-Hunt) sets out to unravel the mystery only to find the story increasingly confusing as it goes along.

He is not alone: the audience will find it confusing too.  Even so, THE HAND is unexpectedly watchable, partly due to its short run time of about an hour, partly due to a fast pace, a noir-ish quality, and better than average acting.  Directed by Henry Cass, the film also features Derek Bond, Reed De Rouen, Reginald Hearne, and Madeleine Burgess.  THE HAND isn't really a film worth hunting out, but if it comes your way by accident, it is worth watching.
