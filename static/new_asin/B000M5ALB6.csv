8325399,3,B000M5ALB6,"I think its rare, but cool when a veteran decides to make a book or home video on mma. Mark Fleming has a good video. He says he also did mma matches not just ""puro resu"". I mostly like it because of the shoot interviews he does. He drops names like Lou Thesz (his manager for 7 years), George Tragos and Reeves (movie Hercules).  Like I said watch it for the shoot interviews. Mostly all the machine or dumbell workouts can be found in a body builder magazine. He's got one cool exercise he does with the help of that other pro wrestler. Its sad to see him all injured from wrestling for all those years.
When he's speaking they get closeups/angles of his ""cauliflower ear"". Its like an hour long workout, a half hour interview, and 10 mins of his Japan highlights.",1349568000,,766,4.356643356643357
