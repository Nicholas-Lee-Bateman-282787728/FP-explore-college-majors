1651684,3,B00005QW57,"Liz Gillies is as sweet as she can be, however, I don't enjoy the workout so much.  It does work you out, but it is extremely easy on the toning.  I don't feel much - and I've been doing ball workouts for a while. It's great for getting into pilates and just beginning on the ball.",1009929600,21,281,4.0

7951158,5,B00005QW57,"Tried and true - have used it for years to achieve and maintain flexibility and help with my breathing. Using the big ball makes it so fun, guess I'm like a kid at recess. Liz Gillies is cheerful, with a pleasing voice. She is a wonderful teacher! I am very grateful to her.
Truth is, I bought the ball, mat, and TAPE (yes, I said tape) once upon a time long, long ago  . . . and then didn't do it.
Some years later (even though I gladly wore the Yoga Zone t shirt all that time) I started doing it. Wow! It makes me feel so good! And then I wore out the tape and VCR's went the way of the dinosaur, so I switched over to DVD.
This current DVD is my backup in case I wear out the one I'm using!
I guess I should mention it gives me a wonderful feeling of satisfying accomplishment, improves the way my clothes fit, and helps me with a health issue in a very gentle way.
To sum up this rather long missive, I swear by Pilates yoga and Liz Gillies! I give the Zone Pilates Mat & Ball Workout DVD a 10 (out of 10, of course).",1383696000,2,1022,3.9134615384615383
7951159,5,B00005QW57,"Liz Gillies as you can see by the date of production was the first person to develop a 'commercialized' approach to functional stability ball and pilates, which was and really should stay as a very personalized class study on HOW you're performing the movements, integrating muscles rather than beating up the muscles which need to surrender,and learning by hers or other instructors CUES, something new or 3 dimensional about the body.
 Liz is one of the rare examples of a teachers who really know proper postual adaptations , yet creates a program light enough that you can enjoy learning about what will make you better stronger and smarter one phase at a time!  This original work was about deepening self awarenesss. LIz gets the depth and concentration it requires to develop the personal interbal energy organically rather than having to impress people by killing them or injuring them to impress one population who needs to be more introspective to begin with!  Her other tapes move faster, but when your commissioned to make a tape for millions of potential out of shape people who work and don't have time for the gym, you must regulate the level of the workout for the masses. I personally have studied and worked with liz and I can say she can turn it on for those who can take it and keep up with the coordination flexibility and endurance, along with the mental and physical coordination to make it through! Wish she would do another series!",1338940800,6,1456,4.792828685258964

7951161,3,B00005QW57,"Wow, I must be really out of shape compared to the other reviews!  I found this tape to be really really difficult for a beginner :(  But it was still fun to try!",1154995200,3,162,3.878787878787879
7951162,5,B00005QW57,"I absolutley love these work outs.

The fat burning work out gets me puffing, and I break a bit of a sweat - but I don't feel like I'm about to vomit because I have worked so hard!  The first time I did this workout I found it really difficult, but I Was incredably unfit - I think like all Liz's workouts they are ideal for beginners.  I still use this workout and I favour it above all the other DVDs I own.  Like anything, the more you put into it, the more you get out, but you can make your muscles work  - legs, buns, stomachs and arms - and you break a sweat.

The second workout is the matwork out, and it is a challenge.  Nonetheless it is definatley for the true beginner as well.  I have been doing this when I want to mix up my routine a little, and I always feel my muscles, especially my abs for two days afterwoulds.

The third workout is strengthening but using the ball.  This makes it a bit easier in terms of preforming the exercises the right way.  This workout is not as hard as the mat workout - but there is one section for the legs that still kills me!

All in all these vidoes are really good for pilates beginners.  Every step is explained, with reminders about form and breathing.  Nonetheless, the chatter is not excessive, and I still find the reminders useful, even though I could probably recite them verbatum!  There is the option of having only the music, in case you find her annoying.",1122854400,19,1419,4.223048327137547
7951163,5,B00005QW57,"This isn't a fast-paced, heavy duty workout, but those aren't for everyone, are they?  Liz Gillies is a knowledgeable, cheery instructor.  The DVD contains three separate programs.  All of them are sprinkled with Liz's words of encouragment and instruction.  You will get a good workout and even sweat (especially in the first program) if you follow her instructions.  If this helps, I'm 42 years old and in pretty good shape, but I'm not (remotely) Karen Voight or Kathy Smith or Denise Austin...
In the Fat Burning workout Liz tells you how to keep your heart rate elevated--even while lying on your back.  It starts with brief instructions about the ball, a short warm-up, and continues with a cardio section that consists of a lot of bouncing on the ball and lifting your arms which is fun, but also works your legs (if you use them instead of just bouncing).  Then it has two segments that keep your heartrate up:  a standing leg work section--mostly lunge-type exercises--followed by a good arms workout--standing up and lifting the ball.  Maybe I'm a weakling, but it puts my arms to work!  The last part is a challenging (for me) workout for legs and abs lying on the floor with legs on the ball which also challenges your balance.  This is followed by a cool-down.
The second workout, Pilates on the floor, I don't do as often as the others.  My DVD is a few years old and I hope they've fixed the problem with the audio which cuts out part-way through the program and comes back later.  You miss the audio instructions on several of the exercises, but can follow along by watching.  Despite that problem I liked the ball workouts so much I kept the defective DVD.  The exercises are good for toning,especially abs, and there aren't so many repetitions that you end up hating life, Liz, and exercise.
The third workout is a toning workout on the ball.  I think it's a good workout, but I'm not as fond of toning as I should be, so I don't do it as often as the first one.  I like it that Liz says, ""I know it's hard, I'm feeling it too"" and ""I'm glad that's over"" during and after a couple of the leg exercises.  She mostly works the legs and abs--Pilates stuff--and not the arms.
I think these are good workouts though a little short, about 30 minutes each. The DVD is a better value than some because you get three workouts.",1068163200,39,2335,4.519047619047619
7951164,4,B00005QW57,"I'm a beginner with pilates and I found this DVD very helpful. Although I think that pilates isn't much of a workout, it's more to use it as streching exercises. If your a beginner with pilates I think this is a good choice; if you think this ones to easy step up to the next level.",1054080000,4,282,4.053571428571429
7951165,4,B00005QW57,"I like this dvd because the instructor is pleasant,the scenery is beautiful and the routines offer variety to my workout.  Although the ""Fat-Burning"" workout is not really difficult cardio by any means-I don't think it was intended to be. That said,the stability ball exercises are well demonstrated and for beginners,Liz does spend alot of time with positioning,although this part can be boring for those familiar with the ball-just do crunches on it while she talks. I liked the sculpting segment because you can adjust weights accordingly and the pilates was well cued.",1050105600,5,572,5.217391304347826
