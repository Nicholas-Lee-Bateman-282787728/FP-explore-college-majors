8513761,5,B007BEOE8W,"Absolutely necessary for your l&eacute;g&egrave;ret&eacute; library. Good detail to see students under instruction and their development. Helps you to understand what and how to put in practice what PK describes in his ""Twisted Truths"" book, demonstrates in his 4 instructional Classical dressage and the 2 High Noon dvd/video series. Clear and understandable.",1478736000,,360,5.9423076923076925
8513762,4,B007BEOE8W,just don't like hearing the translator in german in the back ground through the whole video it's distracting... otherwise a slow starter but great technique and well defined to go off and practice.,1402876800,,197,5.0
8513763,3,B007BEOE8W,"Because of the great respect for Philipe Karl, I purchased this. I could have used a little more background and instruction. Perhaps a little musch of watching riders ride in circles using a technique I am not certain I would encourage in beginner riders. This is a DVD for intermediate/advanced riders.",1359158400,2,303,4.96078431372549
