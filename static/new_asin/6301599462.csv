From the time I was around 4 years old, every sunday my mother and I would buy a bunch of junk food, lay around the house, and watch Faerie Tale Theatre. At the time, my mother was single and working. We didn't have enough money to buy a VCR but at the time, you could rent VCR's at the video store along with your movies. So everytime a new movie from Faerie Tale Theatre came out we'd hit the video store and have one of our special days. A little sentimental, I understand, but it's something I won't forget. Its been a VERY long time since I got to watch one but I still remember and have my favorites. I recomend these videos for all the little ones out there and for parents who want to share something special with their child. Thank you.",1076803200,4,881,4.218934911242603
338075,5,6301599462,"Irresistable and classic episode of Faerie Tale Theatre featuring one of the best Snow White adaptations besides the Disney version. Elizabeth McGovern makes a sweet and totally believable Snow White, and Vanessa Redgrave is wickedly excellent as her wicked queen of a stepmother. Rex Smith turns in a terrific performance as the singing Prince, and all the actors who play the dwarfs are amazing and very funny. Great film by Peter Medak features a great cast, superb script and a sweet music score.",1076457600,,500,5.036144578313253
7813005,5,6301599462,"I loved Faerie Tale Theatre as a kid, and this was my favorite episode.  Whenever the show would come on I would hope and pray they would show this episode.  I grew up and sort of forgot about Faerie Tale Theatre and then one day it just popped in my head.  I immediately remembered this episode. This adaption of Snow White is my favorite.  I like this version better than the Disney one.  The casting is top-notch. Vanessa Redgrave as the Evil Queen is nothing short of billiant.  She gives new meaning to the word: vain.  She takes the character of the Evil Queen to a whole new level, and makes her a force to be reckoned with.  The subtle emotional shifts in her character are amazing to watch.  She's not just seething with jealousy, she also has a hair-trigger temper that can erupt at any moment.  She yells and throws things when she doesn't get her way, or when the Magic Mirror (Vincent Price) tells her something she doesn't want to hear.  But he's not afraid her and will even talk back to her.  Vincent Price gives the Magic Mirror a real personality.  You'll find yourself wondering if he's not secretly rooting for Snow White.  He's a magic mirror that's tired of being asked the same question everyday.  He rolls his eyes at the queen's out-control vanity.

Elizabeth McGovern is perfect in the role of Snow White.  Over the years, many dark-haired, fair-skinned women have been cast in the role.  But Elizabeth McGovern is Snow White, if she was a real person.  She's so pretty.  She looks as if she was born to play the role.  She brings sweetness and an innocence to the role without coming off as completely gullible.  It takes coaxing on the queen's part to get her to take a bite of the apple.  And to round out the cast, Rex Smith is a singing prince who sits in the forest singing about finding true love with a maiden most fair.  His goofy sweetness makes him memorable. Its hard to say who the star of the show is.  All of the actors contribute equally (in my opinion) and help to make this adaption of the the classic fairy tale special.",1520121600,,2065,4.442666666666667

Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is phenomenal.  Starring Elizabeth McGovern, Vanessa Redgrave and the late Vincent Price, its screenplay is intelligent and its soundtrack manages to be both romantic and melancholy.

The costuming is remarkable, especially the range of costumes that Ms. Redgrave wears.  She retains a cold appeal in colorful gowns as the queen, and her performance shifts effortlessly to match the nondescript rags she wears as a disguise to twice prey on Snow White.  Elizabeth McGovern is exceptionally stunning as Snow White, looking as though she were born to play the part.  She perceptively acts the role with an understated quality that naturally elicits the innocence and goodness her character must have.  Vincent Price may have been the only actor working at the time who could believably be the Magic Mirror.  He plays the Mirror with whimsical coldness, and the production solves the logistical problem of a ""magic"" mirror existing within the realm of credible effects for its budget with odd ingenuity.

Also featuring a cameo appearance by series creator Shelley Duvall and solid narration by Price, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is nothing short of brilliant.",1269993600,,1258,5.28140703517588

7813010,2,6301599462,"I agree Elizabeth McGovern was a suitable Snow White, but the story is so different from the Disney version that it should not be called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The wicked queen certainly did not look like a wicked witch.  Very poor casting.  The dwarfs were ill-mannered and contentious, and we missed not hearing ""Hi, Ho"".  In other words, we were very disappointed in this version.",1149984000,,394,4.75
7813011,4,6301599462,"With her lips as red as rubies, hair black as ebony, and skin as white as snow, our heroine Princess Snow White (Elizabeth McGovern) is the most beautiful in the land. This is much a curse as blessing, and earns her the muderous jealousy of her stepmother, (Vanesa Redgrave) the queen of the land, and the former most beautiful in all the land. Fortunately for Snow White, she has the loyalty of seven drarfs who take her in, but ultimately cannot protect her from the queen's scheme to see her lovely, innocent stepdaughter dead. Can the love of a handsome prince save our innocent Snow White from a premature death?

Ms. Redgrave is perfect in this role. Unlike some versions, she's lovely enough to convince us she could be a runner-up in the beauty department. She's brings the humor to her wicknedness, and her scenes in front of the witty, longer-suffering mirror, (Vincent Price) had me in stitches. Ms. McGovern brings Snow White's innocence/naivete to the forefront, and looks pretty. Alas, not much is needed for this character. The real female with meat to sink her teeth into is the queen.

The dwarfs are an endearing bunch, always good for additional laugh. The stand out performance is by Tony Cox who plays Bubba. The prince fell a little flat with me. There was zero chemistry between him and his leading lady, but thankfully, there are only about five minutes of the movie left by the time they meet, so it doesn't do too much damage.

I reccomend this for the young, and the young at heart.",1140307200,4,1509,4.665413533834586

7813013,4,6301599462,"This is one of the best entries in the fabulous FAERIE TALE THEATRE series, with a superb cast and haunting music score.

Elizabeth McGovern is luminous in the title role of Snow White. Her acting is very understated and she perfectly captures the innocence and bewilderment of the character. Vanessa Redgrave offers a tour-de-force performance as the Wicked Queen, who dons several magical disguises to ensnare our heroine. Rex Smith gives us a Prince who is handsome yet goofy (a refreshing change), and Vincent Price is a delight as both the Magic Mirror and Narrator. Series creator Shelley Duvall has a brief role as Snow White's mother during the prologue.

Sharp direction by Peter Medak and a brilliant, haunting musical score round out the package. This is FAERIE TALE THEATRE at it's height.",1099008000,20,801,5.015037593984962
7813014,5,6301599462,"I am a big fan of the Faerie Tale Theatre series.  This film is one of my absolute favorites.  Vanessa Redgrave gives a wonderfully over the top performance as the wicked and vengeful queen.  Elizabeth McGovern is a kind and gentle Snow White and Vincent Price is unforgettable as the Magic Mirror.  These films are great for kids because there is all of the wonderment of fairy tales.  They are especially entertaining for adults because there is some crude humor in them that will have the older folks laughing.  As far as the production, the music is beautiful and the sets are wonderful.  Everything about these films is based after the theatre, as if you were watching a play.  Very entertaining and intriguing films that will create memories to last a lifetime.  If you've seen these movies then you understand how special they are.  It was great to see actors and actresses before they became big and had a little fun in these great films!!!!!  I recommend these films to anyone who wants to be whisked away to another time and place or to anyone who wants to have a little laugh. A+",1086480000,2,1090,4.595854922279793
