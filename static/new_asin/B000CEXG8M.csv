8098772,3,B000CEXG8M,"I bought this after the release of the season 1 and 2 bundle, mainly to see if it still holds any value for me. I found it doesn't. So while I can buy more episodes in a more compact format, I probably won't until in goes below $10, which it will eventually.",1406505600,,258,3.980769230769231
8098773,4,B000CEXG8M,"This is the 3 DVD of Zatch Bell and I think it turned out quite well. As usual Makoto Raiko made a cartoon which has meaning and humour all in one. Ok so maybe the episode The Invincible Folgore didn't have that much meaning but me and my friends sat there laughing our heads off. I guess Makoto wanted Zatch Bell to have a bit of comical relief. The last episode is great but quite sad so you have to feel quite sorry for the character (Sherry). I won't try to descibe to much of the story though, you will have to find that out for yourself. Personally its a great buy if you aren't to serious to watch a Silly Italian superstar and his mamodo dancing around and making great fools of themselfs. (Don't worry serious people the rest of the episodes are a great watch for you to!). I recomend this to all people over the age of 10. Zatch Bell is my favorite show so why shouldn't i give it a 4 out of 5.",1154649600,,904,4.084269662921348
8098774,2,B000CEXG8M,Zatch Bell is an amazing series but only for a certain amount of episodes. Here Zatch is put as a children's show and you can tell by all the editing and episodes of them taking nothing seriously. Then you have more episodes that are annoying and pointless. There's too much playing going on in this series and it seems to be so they can stretch it into a long long series and it doesn't have to be. It's a great show but with a lot of unneeded baggage and these episodes fall into that spot.,1147046400,,492,4.189473684210526
