3521092,4,B001D0F74K,"In its incisive portrayal of modern relationships and dating, ""Avatars"" offers punchy dialogue and an array of hilariously zany situations.  The movie revolves around Lisa, a married woman who realizes her career-obsessed husband is cheating on her via an online persona.  As she counterattacks by constructing her own online identity, her revenge plot spins out of control and memorable characters such as a faux French suitor and mysterious, bow-tied stranger intervene.  The movie's key strengths are in screenwriter Khoury's snappy banter and absurdist circumstances, all of which are on full display in the film's denouement when Lisa's oblivious, swinger husband fails to realize that he is about to cheat on Lisa with Lisa herself.  For some people, the anonymous empowerment of the internet is like a drug -- ""Have you got any pot?"" -- and this small gem delivers a real hit.",1218672000,,883,5.197183098591549
3521093,4,B001D0F74K,"I thought ""Avatars"" was a very entertaining short film. Robert Khoury did a wonderful of job writing the screenplay and Bob Campbell and Mike Ofenheim also did an excellent job with the direction and production, considering this was their first film! The young and talented cast was outstanding and helped make the film very amusing. The subject matter deals with something we can all relate to today - Cyberspace. It takes a funny yet realistic look at internet dating, cheating and the real life scams that are out there. I especially like the ending. I highly recomend this film and look foward to their next project.",1218585600,,620,4.8584905660377355

3521095,5,B001D0F74K,"Credit first time director, Mike Ofenheim for this cleverly shot and directed piece, Avatars.  Ofenhiem gets the most out of the funny and well thought out script.  The plot moves quickly and the dialogue is fast paced.  Jennifer Strand simply shines in the leading role and is ably backed by wise-cracking Kymm Walker.  The only minor complaint I have is that the background music is inconsistent.  Sometimes it is brilliant as the music perfectly captures the cat and mouse scene between Lisa and her admirer in the park.  But more often then not it misses it's mark and adds a bit of a downer to what is an humorous and lively production.  I would recommend this piece to anybody who enjoys intelligent dram-edy with a twist.",1218499200,,728,4.73015873015873
3521096,5,B001D0F74K,"Avatars.  Small budget does not by necessity mean small concept.  Today's Hollywood appears to produce only those films that blow things up and murder people.  Instead of PG, R, and X, perhaps they should just have to advertise the number of people apparently killed, and the cash value of the physical property destruction portrayed.  Instead, what the ensemble of Avatars  has done, is to produce a pleasant little short story--as different from the full-length feature as written short story is from a novel.  Given that, the author stayed within his boundaries and did not attempt too much, but rather created a series of incidents that are brought together at the close with a degree of skill that would not embarrass the finer writers of print short stories. The acting is not as good as the writing, but only one character actually reminds you of that while watching the film.  But for a little moment (31 minutes or so) the audience is brought into a situation with which many can identity and taken through a series of turns and moves.  The creators provide an ending that will that will make the viewer glad to have taken the time to watch this little film.",1218412800,,1167,4.742574257425742
3521097,4,B001D0F74K,"I enjoyed this film from many differenet perspectives. It was not a billion dollar production, and thats what I usually see. I guess when it comes to cinema, I am a little lazy, so for this movie, I had to turn my brain on. I had to not look for hollywood, but investigate the story. Some parts, from a relationship perspective hit home, which can make one uncomfortable, which, I looked at as a positive. One aspect I thought was very strong was the music, not sure the technical nomenclature, but, it made an impression. And.............when it was over, I said to myself, is that it?? because, I guess I goot hooked and wanted to see more. So, well done, and thanks for sharing, and no...........these days,  I don't have smoke.",1218412800,,731,4.580152671755725
3521098,5,B001D0F74K,We found AVATARS entertaining. It is well written from both the witty and intellectual standpoint.  The technical quality is outstanding. It is enjoyable viewing.  I highly recommend it and give it a 5 star rating.,1217980800,,214,5.085714285714285
3521099,4,B001D0F74K,"A well-crafted short in which I especially liked the acting. Appropriately one-dimensional, the actors all created a visceral response: Lisa's  natural sadness, Jenna rushing her funny one-liners as if perpetually late for a date, Ty's snaky smile and oily delivery. Kudos to the director for restraining them. The plot did cause me to scratch my head at a couple of points (bar scene with Ty and the ending) and the score was sometimes reminiscent of Dark Shadows. I recommend this as an amusing and sometimes poignant film.",1222819200,,525,5.0344827586206895
3521100,4,B001D0F74K,"The names have been changed to protect the innocent....

A friend told me this was a must see ""short"". I found it an interesting update to an age old story...men and women. They never change but in this film the use of the ""web"" presents a view on how that tangle can be weaved anew.  Hoorah to the writer for taking on this task and delivering it with an entertaining wit that I found refreshing. There are some quirky, ""huh"" moments...Beatle lines delivered in a French? accent (I think I know where the `pot' lines come from) and there could have been a few wardrobe calls for one character in particular but overall easily overlooked. Bottom line-an enjoyable short little film that goes good with a bottle of wine on a rainy afternoon especially if you ""got any..?  (see the film-you'll understand).
Steve Bianco

After watching AVATARS initially we found this to be a humorous and light hearted look at an alternate reality. The writing was wonderfully witty.  When viewing this film for the second and third time we were delighted to find that the plays on words, the repeatedly lines and the jokes were even more apparent.  The characters seemed well cast....
Tie me up Tyler, Brian Woodard, played his role perfectly... he was easy to distain as a bright educated guy with few social skills. His facial expressions and lack of attention during the scenes that required such were performed without exaggeration but seemed to flow as naturally as if he were truly the jerk he portrayed.
Bow Tie Guy... ie the French Lover, also known as McCay Carpenter, was both entertaining and annoying simultaneously...much as the character he was depicting. Loved the ending... he really carried off the guy with a heart.
Jenna-licious... known in her former life as Kimm Walker, delivered some wonderfully funny lines... played her casted part well.
Jennifer Strand, was cast as a naive and less than worldly sort, practical and comfortable in her life of waiting... ask no questions... hear no lies existence... did a good job portraying just that type of character.
We would certainly recommend this film to those who want to enjoy the humor and light heartedness of an avant-garde production.",1219795200,,2191,4.876344086021505
3521101,3,B001D0F74K,"Avatars is an offbeat surrealist jaunt into the techno mayhem of present day bio-cyber relationships.  Astute observations of the human condition are reflected poignantly in this timely narrative.  Notable is the performance by Jennifer Strand, who pulls off the near impossible: she conjures many elements of candor, emotion, and pathos, while Rome is burning around her.  This feat works best when she plays off of McKey Carpenter, who deserves praise for his acting.  The technical aspects of the film go on unnoticed, as they should; kudos (pronounced: q-dose) to the spartan set design, lighting and cinematography.  The editing is tight and cohesive.  I would have to agree the music is quirky at times, but not enough to be distracting as others have suggested.  Unfortunately, the noose in this game of hangman is the performance by Brian Woodard.  From all appearances, he did not understand what the role demanded.  Brian and Kymm would be well served by discovering this Amazon jewel:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Idiot-s-Guide-to-Acting/dp/0028641531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Idiot's Guide to Acting</a>.

3521102,4,B001D0F74K,"I had heard about this film from several friends and decided to check it out myself.  Overall I found the story interesting and nicely paced.  While some of the acting was a bit over the top, the script included several good jokes and a little surprise at the ending.

Overall - 4 stars and I would recommend it to others.",1219708800,,322,4.333333333333333
3521103,4,B001D0F74K,Woody Allen meets Sofia Coppola in this atmospheric glimpse at lust in a parallel reality among twenty-somethings.

3521104,4,B001D0F74K,"Director Michael Ofenheim exceeds expectations with this clever short film.  The film manages to take a depressing (yet realistic) story line and actually make it humorous.  Make sure to watch it more than once.  You are guaranteed to pick up on several new jokes each time you watch.  My only critique...  some of the jokes seem slightly outdated, but funny nonetheless.",1219104000,,371,5.016393442622951
3521105,4,B001D0F74K,"...or two, just to pick up on all of the things packed in the 30 minutes. The positives far outweigh the negatives, so I'll only give you the negatives in my positive review...ready? First, Kymm Walker, she is one of the reasons I mentioned to watch it a few times. At some points she just blows through her lines like she had somewhere else to be and just had to get it done. There was a funny line towards the end that I didn't get/hear until the second viewing. I don't want to give anything away, but pay attention (it wasn't the weed joke). Other than that she was good. Second, the actor that played Tyler was completely unlikeable. I was thinking maybe that was intentional, I wasn't suppose to like the character, but unless this guy is the next Ted McGinley (best actor ever, google it) I think I just didn't like him, which worked for the film, just wanted to put it out there. Third and final, the background music was overwhelming at times. Overall great first attempt and I am looking forward to future endeavors.",1219104000,3,1026,4.462765957446808
3521106,3,B001D0F74K,"Clever writing and a couple fine performances make this short film worth your time.  The directing and editing aren't so great: the movie has a choppy feel, with several poor transitions.  Some of the acting is downright bad (the director has to bear some responsibility here too), but the film is redeemed by a solid contribution from the male romantic lead (find out who at the end), and a side-splitting performance from Kymm Walker, who plays the trouble-making best friend.  Ms. Walker almost single-handedly made this film transcend its production values to seem polished and professional. I hope we'll be seeing more of her in the movies.",1219017600,,645,5.009345794392523
3521107,4,B001D0F74K,"This is a ""Thinking"" movie, so turn on your brain cells before hitting the play button. Cleaver writing using lyrics from a Beatles song in the 60's as a pickup line for the new cyber dating format of the zeros.

There are three things that a good film must possess:  a good story, a good director and good acting.

8290673,1,B001D0F74K,"I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The best performance in the movie was given by the actor playing Charlie. Jenna's timing was lacking, the role of Tyler should have been recast, and Lisa was whiny with no facial emotion. Better actors would have made a better film. The writing left me almost angry. The intended one liners were lost on the actors.
I wish I had not viewed this film.",1255996800,,396,4.513888888888889
8290674,1,B001D0F74K,"From the start it drags--the cheating husband is so terrible an actor that you feel neither annoyed at him for being a bastard nor sorry for him for losing his love, but total apathy.  The mercilessly repeated punchline ""So, do you have any Pot?"" is Avatar's only attempt at humour.  The plot itself is tripe, trying to weave together notions of solipsism and internet dating, with a touch of the implausible Nigerian 419 email scam.  I don't know if the director's brains were addled with pot himself when he did this--but it's no good at all.",1244246400,,544,4.645833333333333

8290676,4,B001D0F74K,"I heard about this movie from a friend and watched it with low expectations (being a mainstream Hollywood sort of movie fan).  I was immediately impressed.  The dialogue was surprisingly witty, reminding me of a cross between Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. The story was curiously odd and the actors were slightly better than satisfactory. What I was most impressed with was the overall package (i.e. cinematography, lighting, concepts, etc.) which I have to attribute to superb direction by Michael Ofenheim. I look forward to big things from him in the future. Give this one a shot.  You will be delightfully astonished.",1225670400,,626,5.117647058823529

8290678,4,B001D0F74K,"I like the continuous change of funny and pointed dialogs in the movie. The music underlines well the story; the lightning gives the scenes a particular character while the scenes itself string well together and smoothly develop the story to an end. The actress Jen Strand is playing well, while for the actors Kymm Walker and Brian Woodard I wish to see a little bit more engagement in their roles. Kymm could act a little bit friendlier to Jen, her best friend in the movie. Brian on the other hand, he acts a bit as if he is reading the script.  Last, I feel something more contemporary than the papyrus scroll from which the email is getting read to the viewer should have been used since the story is getting developed around the Internet. Overall, the movie is a good entertainment.",1225324800,,788,4.588652482269503
8290679,4,B001D0F74K,"The film opens with credits. I'm indifferent to that now, however at first viewing I didn't much feel that ""credits in the opening"" type of vibe. I associate credits in the opening with either of the following: older movies, and movies with elaborate and complex opening scenes that cleverly (visually speaking) display opening credits. AVATARS is not an older flick, nor does it involve a big, complex opening. I feel that if the credits are shown in the beginning, it tends to feel like an unecessary prelude. This coupled with the music written for the opening which I did not like, work together to become the weakest part of this short. Why were the credits re-rolled at the end of the film as well? I found this perplexing.

The underlying story is great. The director tackled the issue of how the virtual can collide with reality to create confusion, reveal untruths, and ultimately lead to truth. I really enjoyed the photography, acting (except for the main character's friend) and the direction. The actress who played the main character, Lisa, was fantastic. She had the best lines, she delivered them well, and she's cute, unlike her co-star, Kim Walker. The guy who played the cheating husband was a great casting move. He fits the part perfectly, and executed well.

I think the dialogue could have been better. Also, I did not understand the ""got any pot?"" joke. I never found this funny, can someone explain to me why it was repeated so many times?

All in all, I say BRAVO to AVATARS...director Ofenheim has the obvious skill and vision to create quality films.",1224460800,2,1578,4.794117647058823
