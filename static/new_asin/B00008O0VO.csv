Don't get the Puppy Smarts video - its so simple and costly in comparison.  Doggy Cuts was fun too, but its not easy to use in DVD format.

 I enjoyed the wide varitey of dogs used in this DVD. Interesting tips were used for both large and small dogs. (I don't have a short legged dog, but was fascinated that this was covered in the section on ""down"".) My dog loved Nicole's voice, and watches the speakers intently when she praises the dogs.

1855322,2,B00008O0VO,"I felt that the lessons presented on this DVD will be more affective when used to train more food/treat driven dogs that are willing to work for a reward like a cookie etc in exchange for the owner's desired behavior, but will more than likely frustrate the dog owner that has a highly independent dog who has little or no interest in performing in exchange for a ""cookie"" There is essentially no dog psychology discussed on this DVD which leaves the viewer relying completely on the methods presented, with no understanding of the ""why's and hows"" behind what the dog may be doing, or thinking during a training session, but instead just a series of ""moves with cookies as a reward the owner can do"" which I believe will not provide the universal desired result that many people dealing with serious dog behavior issues my be looking to remedy through the use of this DVD as it only demonstrates motions for the owner to go through instead of any understanding as to why they're going through them.

I also found the off script attempts at humor to be a waste of time, and some of the explanations provided about how dolphins at sea world can be trained with food and therefore that must mean that dogs can also be trained with food alone to be a real problematic premise for why the techniques presented in the video should work for all dogs, and is a real ambitious logic. I have a great deal of respect for Nicole Wilde and believe that she is truly an expert in canine behavior, and have no doubts if she came to your house to train your dog would likely have an invaluable perspective/point of view on how to help, but this DVD it is primarily a cookie-driven training system which I believe will stifle anyone with a dominant, obnoxious, severely hyper, or highly distracted dog during attempts to train.

I appreciate the idea of using positive methods for training dogs, and I really like the humane treatment of all animals which is why I gave this DVD 2 stars, however based on training effectiveness, I feel that plenty of people who turn to this DVD to help resolve problem behavior their dog is illustrating, who happen to own a dog with an independent, socially disinterested personality, will find themselves very frustrated as no deep canine psychology/understanding is revealed, or training methods that deal with dogs who don't want your cookie illustrated. The ""untrained dogs"" in this DVD are so ridiculously food driven the trainer can hardly keep them off of their hands and out of their pockets as they ""train"" them. Anyway, some of the techniques will work quite well for easy, friendly, well socialized dogs who love to work for food. People looking to correct unwanted behavior from dogs demonstrating highly undesirable behaviors should look for a DVD that includes more problem resolution/dog psychology based instruction in my opinion.",1425686400,2,2865,4.774193548387097

1855324,3,B00008O0VO,"This movie is okay. The things a like about this movie is that the girls in the movie did a good job making the method they use make sense to the viewer. The were consistant throughout the entire production. I also like that they broke it down into segments for you. What I didn't like about this video is that the training sessions weren't in depth. They were short and concise. But they didn't give the viewer a chance to see how to work with a dog/puppy that was misbehaving or timid. The dogs that they worked with had already been worked with. So my advise to you would be this:  if you have a puppy that seems to be eager to learn or if you are thinking about getting puppy, I would recommend this video. If you have a dog that has behavior problems I would recommend buying a video that breaks each training session down and is more thorough in description.

The ideology behind the video is good, but the video doesn't do a lot to help dog owners train their own dogs, which was what I was expecting. All of the dogs in the video very willingly offered the behaviors and were very calm, arguably not representative of the ""average"" person's dog. Also not very much information on fading the clicker or finishing behaviors.

1855390,4,B00008O0VO,"At first I thought the DVD was a little silly since it is filmed at someone's home.  It is 100% positive training with treats and almost no corrections, completely different than any dog obedience class I've ever taken.  BUT, once I got past the initial surprise, I realized how happy and excited the dogs were to work on obedience.
My biggest beef with obedience class is how utterly useless it seems to walk around in circles with your dog on a leash at home while practicing heel.  My dog gets totally bored woking with discipline training, and so do I.  It seems to only work when the leash is on because the dog learns that he would rather be anywhere than doing obedience with you.
This video gave me tons of ideas of ways to train my dog in a fun way using 5 minutes here and there.  I had run out of ideas of things to teach my dog after sit, down, stay, and this DVD gave me more ideas like Leave it, Give, wait, and others.  Yes, this is basic obedience, but useful stuff that will make your dog a wonderful part of the family, which is most people's goal.  And best of all your dog will love it.  He will look forward to pleasing you and getting his reward.  I wish I had started this the day I got my puppy.
  I was worried about using treats to train with until I read an article that said, ""How would you like it if you were only told when you were doing something wrong everyday at work and never got a paycheck for it?""  It really makes sense that a dog must be rewarded for good behavior and they must be engaged with something more interesting than the outside world.  A dog should learn that you are the giver of all things good and being with you is better than chasing cars or barking at neighbor dogs.  Discipline training just doesn't give a dog this kind of incentive, and it seems so boring for both trainer and dog.
I guess this style may not work for all dogs, but it seems to fit our dog perfectly.  He is always excited to please me now by trying really hard to learn what I'm asking.  That makes it rewarding for both of us.  I'm having lots more fun training and getting better results than ever before.  You can read all the same stuff in books, but it is nice to see it done if you are a visual learner like me.
The one positive thing I will say about dog obedience class is it is great for socialization around other dogs.  Dogs really need this from a very young age.  Socialization will not happen in the privacy of your own home so you will need to practice with your dog while at a dog park or around other dogs.  A dog who isn't properly socialized and has anxiety while in public or around other dogs doesn't care how good your treat is.  While you do obedience remember to get out and socialize too.",1274918400,6,2740,4.198852772466539

I was pleasantly surprised at how realistic this DVD is. The two trainers train the way a new puppy owner wants to train. In the house or the yard, with the dog paying attention but not on the leash most of the time. Their training is very intuitive, in other words, they use the dog's natural reactions to adjust the training. To teach come, run away from the dog with treats in your hand. To teach leave it, give a treat reward and then give the item right back to the dog at first. When I was writing Paws & Effect: The Healing Power of Dogs, I noticed that trainers started with very young dogs and trained every day, and thought of ways to keep the dog busy, just as these trainers do.

I have to say, the ""touch"" command reviewed in this video was PRICELESS to us!  I had never seen it before this video but it has proved very useful with our fear-aggressive dog. (Instead of ""rewarding"" her fear-aggressive behavior when we distract her from other dogs with treats, we can reward her for responding to the ""touch"" command. Brilliant!) Would definitely reccomend over the more expensive training video unless you can find that one on another site for way less $ as we did!

We found the lessons to be presented in an easy to follow manner.

The problem she had was with how the lessons were presented for selection on the video.

A menu of lessons is presented on the screen; as you move the cursor, a dogs paw print highlights the specific lessons. You then hit play or enter to select that lesson.

The problem is that it is difficult for her to pick out which lesson is highlighted; particularly if your vision is not quite good, and hers is not.

A different method should be used to highlight the lessons. Highlighting the entire lesson frame would have been much better. She eventually gave up trying to use the lessons because she could not navigate to the lesson of interest.",1224806400,3,801,4.534722222222222

Very professionally put together, this DVD is one of the best out there to show you how to train your dog with your brains, not brawn.  The DVD menus are very cute, and the music that accompanies them makes you feel like you're about to embark on an exciting adventure.

Nicole and Laura make the learning and teaching process fun for even the most inexperienced dog owner.  Their laid back speaking style and easy-going manner makes listening to their instruction enjoyable.

I really like how they explain how the treats should and shouldn't be used- so you don't end up with a dog who will only work when treats are around!  They stress that using positive reinforcement does not mean being permissive; your dog most certainly won't walk all over you if you train using their methods.

Nicole and Laura's instruction of all the basic commands is excellent.  I would have preferred less camera movement during the 'sit' segment, but the actual training techniques are great.  Also, the 'sit' and 'down' segments are done with different doggie challenges- such as how to 'down' a short dog, or how to work with getting a puppy to sit.

Every dog owner should see this DVD, if only to teach your dog more than just how to 'sit', 'down', 'come', and 'stay'.  I was plesantly surprised to find so many 'bonus' commands that you don't normally find in training DVD's, like ringing the bell to go outside, how to take treats gently, among others.  'Go to Bed!' is one of my favorites.

And if you have a ""Home Alone"" dog, Nicole and Laura even go over how to keep them happy and safe while you're away.  :)

I can't say enough good things about this DVD. First of all it's organized so that you can begin with basic commands like Sit, Down and Come. Each skill is a separate button to click, so you can easily watch a single command over and over as many times as needed. The trainers are great, these women explain things very clearly and their upbeat personalities seem to put the dogs at ease. They are also fun to watch since they work with a variety of breeds, and my son was very excited to try it all out. With our help, so far he has taught Pepper Sit, Down, Stay (at least a short one so far) and we're working on Come and also Leave It, since Pepper wants to grab just about everything in the house.

There are very clear demonstrations of clicker training which I have followed to the T and they really work. I highly recommend this DVD.",1112227200,7,284,4.9375
1855517,4,B00008O0VO,"While this has good training instructions,the on-line review over emphasized the clicker training aspects. The DVD talks about clicker training but does not show actual training with it, as it does with other ways of training.",1109894400,12,226,5.305555555555555
1855518,5,B00008O0VO,"I have searched for months for the right training guide to train my 2 yellow labs.  Books were very helpful but I couldn't always get the correct idea by looking at the pictures, this DVD actually showed me the true hand signals along with the verbal cues I needed to train them the way I wished.  Additionally, this DVD is broken down in the various steps needed for a well trained dog.  After viewing the DVD in it's entirety, I could go back and review the ""next"" training phase, and/or add different combinations.  The training tips are short, clear and easily accomplished.  I loved the variety of dogs and their different ages making this a training tool for any dog owner.",1108857600,13,679,4.578512396694215
1855519,5,B00008O0VO,"I just bought my yellow labrador, Amber two months ago when she was two 1/2 months old.  I didn't have a clue how to teach her to obey me.  She was so hyperactive and rowdy, that I almost gave her up to my sister for adoption.

I ordered this DVD, and it really helped me a lot!  Now my dog knows the following: come, sit, down, stay, wait, and even name recall.  The clicker training and tips on behavioural problems helped me a lot too!  I was planning to enroll my puppy in obedience school soon, but now I don't have to!  I can train her myself and save a lot of money!",1101081600,18,573,4.017699115044247
1855520,5,B00008O0VO,"I've been through two different ""obedience training"" classes in the past. My dog flunked. Which was sad, because I brought my cap and gown for him to wear at graduation (sigh).
I wish this video was available then! I am amazed at how enjoyable training your dog can be, for both the pet as well as the owner!
Now, years later, I am getting a new dog. I want to start out right, so I watched this DVD. All I can say is WOW! I love the way the trainers, Laura and Nicole work with the dogs. I found myself smiling throughout. They took many different aged dogs and literally trained them in front of my very eyes. It was that quick! Not only did it look fun for the owner, but also for the dog. The dogs couldn't wait to perform the desired trick.
The owner directions were clear and concise. I know now when I should reward and why. It just makes sense.
I can't wait for my new puppy! This is a video I will watch again and again, so my new dog and I create a lasting, loving bond together.

It is now 3 years later, and I have to say that the gentle methods promoted by this video has helped to create such a great dog. I actually get kind of a sick feeling when I see the kind of methods they promote on television shows like the ""dog whisperer."" You can get so much more accomplished by teaching with love than FORCING the dog to do your will. My dog would do anything for me, because she loves to perform, and I've never had to force her to do anything. If you're looking to train your dog, this is a great place to start!",1100476800,46,1525,4.083333333333333

1855522,5,B00008O0VO,"I am an aspiring dog trainer, so I have seen MANY videos and DVDs.  I have read many books on the subject of dog training as well.  I have read many of Nicole Wilde's books in particular(which, by the way,I really benefitted from) and that is what prompted me to purchase this DVD (because she is one of the trainers featured in it).  Nicole is a well known Certified Pet Dog Trainer and Author (well known amongst many professional dog trainers all over the USA)and she has become a favorite of mine! This DVD is great! It is so well organized and it makes training so EASY.  You don't have to watch a whole DVD in one sitting.  Instead, browse the menu for the behavior you want to train your dog... then select it with your remote control.  Watch it with your dog and then practice it (Viewing and practicing one command might take you 20 minutes or so).  It is broken up into many sections to make training EASY, EFFECTIVE (as far as results AND time)...more so than ANY training video I've ever seen!  Using the techniques that Laura and Nicole demonstrate for you will build a loving bond with your dog AND your dog will think learning is fun... which, I believe, is the very BEST part of this type of training!  You won't regret purchasing this DVD! I think your dog will thank you too!",1097452800,20,1293,4.399159663865547
1855523,5,B00008O0VO,"This is a fun DVD.  Reading books on dog train is helpful but seeing dogs being trained is even more helpful.  This DVD only teaches the basics.  It's not one long video, but is divided by each command.  So if you're teaching your dog to stay, you go to the DVD menu and select ""Stay.""  And the two trainers are very pleasant and watchable.",1096329600,9,340,4.25

Only problem is getting a lowfat treat, I don't want my dogs getting fat.  I also suggest you train your dogs seperated from each other, and use a variety of treats.  I use everything from cat food pieces to hot dog chunks.  My dogs love me!  They can hardly contain themselves, They are so happy! I even trained my cat to come and sit using the same methods.
