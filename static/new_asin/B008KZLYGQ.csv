5168818,5,B008KZLYGQ,"I will say I really did enjoy Lobos de Arga(Attack of the Werewolves) lots of werewolves, great SFX, and funny twist ending. I will agree with Rich Cooper and will say this movie pretty much is Shaun of the Dead but with werewolves. Adding this to my top werewolf film list.",1364947200,,274,4.392156862745098

8528737,5,B008KZLYGQ,"What is it about Spain where they keep putting out great horror/ comedy gems like this?  Was hilarious and fantastic.  Don't be a moron that claims they do not like subtitles, grow up, read the subtitles and enjoy this movie.  If you like this film, check out Witching and Bitching as well.",1457827200,,290,4.538461538461538

8528741,5,B008KZLYGQ,"This is one of the best horror/comedy flicks I've ever seen.  The story line is fresh, fun, and kind of scary.  The movie is full of surprises.  I highly recommend it!!!!!",1396137600,,171,4.451612903225806
8528742,5,B008KZLYGQ,"I Saw this film a couple of years ago at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival but it was called Game of WereWolves and since then I have been looking and watching for it to come out on DVD/Blu-ray. It arrived in New Condition and I was elated that the cover was a 3D pic, for all of the WereWolve Lovers it is a must see. It is in Subtitles but it is worth it.",1392768000,2,360,3.8133333333333335
8528743,4,B008KZLYGQ,"This movie is fantastic!  A little cheesy, but the awesome kind of cheese, like a really smooth Gouda!  A solid effort.",1370908800,,119,4.619047619047619
8528744,5,B008KZLYGQ,"I thought a comedy about the werewolves would never be good. But this movie is just great! I had lots of laughs with it and I enjoyed basically everything: actors, acting, the story, the way werewolves were jumping around and werewolves themselves looked so cool. There were no unnecessary howls like in almost every other movie. This movie should be watched! Even though I am just a beginner in Spanish, and i dislike reading subtitles while watching a movie, I kinda didn't mind it this time. So don't just get my word for it. Don't expect a horrific horror movie, expect to see a cool comedy!",1366243200,3,595,4.622641509433962
8528745,5,B008KZLYGQ,"This Spanish horror film is more fun and even madcap than anything else.  In this story a werewolf that plagues a small village is the result of a gypsy curse, no big news there.  However, here, in order to rid the town of the curse they must sacrifice an individual from the original cursed blood line.  If they don't do it then there will be consequences for the whole village.
The village tricks a clueless writer into returning to his ancestral home just in time to be sacrificed.  He and his terrier meet up with a sheep obsessed boyhood friend and a estranged publicist/manager who join him as he tries to escape the clutches of the villagers.
The mishaps are comical and fun.  The special effects and creature costumes are good and in general this movie offers something fresh to the genre.",1366070400,3,797,4.584507042253521
