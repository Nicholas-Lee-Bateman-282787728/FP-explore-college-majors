5401440,5,B00A92MD6S,I am grateful that this short but well made series is now available on DVD.  Splendid performance as always by James Stewart.  I wish more episodes could have been made.  Thoroughly recommended.,1370390400,6,194,5.0
5401441,4,B00A92MD6S,If you like Matlock you will probably enjoy this short lived series. James Stewart dominates this series. I think if some of the other players were better developed series would of lasted longer.,1365465600,2,195,4.9393939393939394
5401442,3,B00A92MD6S,"I purchased the ""Hawkins: Complete TV-Movie Collection"" in March 2013 even though I felt it was expensive at $43.18.  Thanks to Amazon's efficiency, the DVDs arrived very quickly after the order was placed and shipment made (arrived in approx 6 days; especially to Hawaii).  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  I've viewed only one episode thus far, but the clarity and picture quality makes it seem that I'm seeing the original airing.  What I feel cheated about is the fact that the first episode, ""Hawkins on Murder,"" is missing from the collection.  There were a total of 9 episodes, but only 8 are on the 4 discs (2 per disc).  Be warned you are NOT getting the COMPLETE collection as advertised.",1364688000,6,703,4.721311475409836
5401443,5,B00A92MD6S,"James Stewart stars as Billy Jim Hawkins, a West Virginia, high-powered lawyer, in this 1973 series which had exactly nine episodes, coming in at 1 hour 15 minutes each.  Stewart, in his second TV series, works hard at being a character, and he is well-aided by a supporting cast (Mayf Nutter, James Hampton, Strother Martin) and a bomber cast of 1960's and 1970's actors - William Windom, Tyne Daly, Paul Burke, Sheree North, Cameron Mitchell, Bonnie Bedelia, Kenneth Mars (pre-Inspector Kemp on Young Frankenstein), Julie Harris, Sam Elliott, Jeannette Nolan, among others.  It naturally will remind some of Matlock, the Andy Griffith attorney series of the 1980s and 1990s and producer David Karp said in an interview that Griffith was once approached, but the deal somehow fell through.
I personally love the gripping, action-packed theme song by Jerry Goldsmith, but, somehow, it doesn't quite fit the saga of a laid-back West Virginia lawyer.  No matter, this is well worth the price (no subtitling or special features), thanks to well-written scripts and good direction.",1363478400,18,1077,5.213872832369942
5401444,4,B00A92MD6S,"I dock this product a star only because pretty much no effort has gone into restoring the picture. It is somewhat fuzzy, very grainy from dirt, and has a good bit of damage. The soundtrack is somewhat distorted and strident at times.

As a second note, I found this at the WB web site at a significant discount, and with free shipping.

As for the show itself, this is an almost forgotten gem. Jimmy Stewart plays Hawkins, a former assistant DA turned criminal defense attorney, who is rumored to have never lost a case, though he will not admit to that. He spun the role out of equal parts Elwood P Dowd (Harvey), Paul Biegler (Anatomy of a Murder), and Ransom Stoddard (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance). The resulting character is a brilliant and delightful mixture of home-spun charm, empathetic friend, savvy tactician, and firebrand defender. His investigative style will remind you of Jessica Fletcher, a role created several years later.

Hawkins, always supported in his efforts by an array of cousins (headed by Strother Martin), takes on impossible cases a la Perry Mason. They are intricate and interesting.

Dialogue has surprising depth (for a 70s TV series) and brilliant laugh out loud moments.

Hawkins is a lost treasure for Jimmy Stewart fans, a solid collection of murder solutions for mystery fans, and an outstanding depiction of a defense attorney for legal procedural enthusiasts.

Highly recommended.",1357171200,23,1425,4.991561181434599
5401445,5,B00A92MD6S,"The cast is pretty amazing like they say. James won the Golden Globe that year. Imagine a big actor like him on television. Somebody copping out to him in the courtroom is always fun. I'm pretty sure it's mod, which is unpopular. I take them as I can get them. Like we have a choice. The picture quality is about what you would expect from some old retro show. I got it when they had a deal.",1356480000,11,391,4.090909090909091
5401476,5,B00A92MD6S,Too bad this was only one season.  Much better than Matlock.,1445644800,,60,4.454545454545454
5401477,5,B00A92MD6S,"James Stewart was one of the best in films for many years. No actor, however, can be much better than his material and the material in these 70 minute television shows rarely enhances his craftsmanship, but it is that craftsmanship that saves the day in the few episodes of the series. He is a 5 Star performer who even when not enabled by the creative and  production staff to be at his best, is still good enough to make the shows well worth watching...at least to those of us who were around, young though we may have been then, when he broke into films and watched him over the many years with almost unfailing gratification. As some reviewers have pointed out, sometimes the down home character he portrays has to go a long way to pull up the 'hillbilly' dialogue and characters with which he is often surrounded (poor Strother Martin is one good actor buried by what his role requires of him). Nevertheless, it is a joy to have a chance to see a fine craftsman at work, even if the setting is more reminiscent of an older era in film that was becoming obsolete in contemporary television.",1435795200,,1094,4.49748743718593
5401478,2,B00A92MD6S,These episodes with such a prominent actor is pretty bad.,1429833600,,57,4.8
5401479,5,B00A92MD6S,"I enjoyed this series. It was wholesome entertainment, the kind I feel OK with sharing and will probably watch again some time.  Because it was an older show, the film quality isn't ""up-to-date"", but I still enjoyed it.",1417392000,4,219,4.7631578947368425
5401480,3,B00A92MD6S,"At the time the show originally aired I thought it was an original and clever series.  James Stewart's performance, as well as those of the supporting cast, was outstanding.  Watching it again 30 years later it doesn't seem as fresh or innovative.  Perhaps it is because the format has been copied so many times.  Whatever the reason, it still remains a good show; just not the great mystery series I remember.",1410998400,,410,4.732394366197183
5401481,2,B00A92MD6S,"I'm a big James Stewart fan and thought any thing he was in was bound to  be good.  Maybe it's the writing, or maybe he was just not into it, but it definitely lacks something.",1408579200,,176,4.0
5401482,4,B00A92MD6S,"I am addicted to all television from the 1970s and Hawkins qualifies. I have to say that I'm not as crazy about this series as I am about others such as MacMillan and Wife or Columbo. There is a hokey quality to this show that is slightly off putting. Small town lawyer with impeccable morals, smarter than everyone else, kind of like Andy Taylor as a lawyer pre Matlock. It's worth watching and entertaining, just not something I'd bring with me to a desert island.",1400457600,8,466,4.4941176470588236

5401484,4,B00A92MD6S,"Hawkins' courtroom histrionics are a bit corny, but on the whole I enjoyed this series, with excellent supporting players from Julie Harris to Paul Burke to Lew Ayres. Many familiar faces, and excellent scripts mostly authored by Robert Hamner ( must be related to Earl Hamner?) Worth the trip down memory lane, especially for Matlock/Murder She Write fans.",1391040000,5,357,5.172413793103448
5401485,5,B00A92MD6S,"It's great to see this excellent TV movie series with James Stewart finally on DVD.  This 4-DVD set includes all eight episodes from 1973-1974:

1. Death and the Maiden (AKA Hawkins on Murder)
2. Murder in Movieland
3. Die Die, Darling
4. A Life for a Life
5. Blood Feud
6. Murder in the Slave Trade
7. Murder on the Thirteenth Floor
8. Candidate for Murder

The Internet Movie Database lists nine episodes but ""Death and the Maiden"" and ""Hawkins on Murder"" are actually the same episode which aired on March 13, 1973.

Stewart's character Billy Jim Hawkins is similar to the role he played in the 1959 film ""Anatomy of a Murder.""  His character reminds me of Andy Griffith's Ben Matlock character from the ""Matlock"" series (1986-1995).  If anyone enjoys ""Matlock,"" I think they would also enjoy watching ""Hawkins.""",1378166400,10,815,4.785714285714286
8548604,4,B00A92MD6S,"Some episodes are better than others (the weakest, inmo, was the episode which takes place in Hawkins' home town).  Still James Stewart is worth watching in almost anything.  This show, while unsuccessful, spawned Matlock.  Another plus are the familiar faces who guest star in every episode.  I enjoyed this show.",1529452800,,314,5.22

8548607,4,B00A92MD6S,Soundtrack isn't quite matched with their mouths when they speak. But I just don't focus on the mouths. Otherwise I am enjoying these. Big James Stewart fan.,1500508800,,157,4.851851851851852
8548608,5,B00A92MD6S,I have to admit that I never saw this show or even heard about it until recently. I love the good old boy attitude that Jimmy Stewart does as the attorney Hawkins (precursor to Matlock?). It's also fun to see and reminisce about all the guest stars (familiar to us who grew up in this era). Definitely worth the price for hours of entertainment.,1487462400,,345,4.40625
