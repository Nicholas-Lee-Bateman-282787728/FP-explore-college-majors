8345216,4,B001UWAMP0,"Growing up in the 1950's the coming attractions were always one of the best parts of the show for me! After Madison Avenue instead of the studios started producing them in the late 1960's they pretty much lost all their charm...now all of them look the same and bore me to death. The trailers for 1930's to early 1960's films are great though, with all of the superimposed titles (""Filmed with all of the scope of the world itself!"") and pompous narration. They were frequently much better than the films themselves and I could watch them all day! This is a very good collection with all of the trailers from the that golden age and some rare ones that even I have never seen. About 70 trailers with a running time of over 2 1/2 hours. Video quality varies a bit but considering the source material it's perfectly acceptable. I'd give it 5 stars except it's on a DVD-R (the kind you burn on your computer or in your standalone DVD recorder) instead of a regular pressed DVD. DVD-R's have the reputation of being not as durable or long lasting and I think that should have been plainly mentioned on Amazon's description. Still highly recommended if you love old trailers! I'm going to order the sequel ""More Coming Attractions"" right away.",1256428800,2,1238,4.606334841628959
8345217,5,B001UWAMP0,"Before movie trailers became super noisy with annoying lightning fast jump cut, they would advertise some of the best movies made ini the 40s,50, and 60s. The technique back then was to show a scene or 2, then some splash words would jump into the screen, like,""Never to be Forgotton!"", ""A Wild Romance!"", ""Filled with Action!"", etc. These movies are famous and some are obscure, but the trailers are fun, often better than the actual movie!",1241827200,4,441,4.815789473684211
