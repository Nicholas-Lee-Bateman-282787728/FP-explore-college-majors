818307,4,6304268432,"Without Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung in the sequel, many wondered how Jackie would fare in Project A 2. The answer was blasted onto the screen in another of Chan's masterpieces. Although not quite up to the dizzy heights  of Project A, the sequel still features some of the craziest and most  inventive pieces of action ever seen. The stunt filled finale makes  Hollywood pale in comparison. (It's also very well directed!).",941673600,,420,4.805555555555555
818308,5,6304268432,This is one of the BEST Jackie Chan films I have seen.  The Action scenes are some of the best I have watched.  I totally suggested that anyone that is a Jackie Chan fan buy this film and have it in their collection.,923961600,3,216,4.0
818422,4,6304268432,"This movie was pretty good, but after watching the first, I expected just a little bit more fighting and a little more comedy. The first had more comedy and the stunts were better. Despite that, the movie was still pretty good.",1229904000,,227,4.560975609756097
818423,5,6304268432,"I had seen Project A many times, so when, seeing Project A2 for the first time, was expecting more of the same (I also gave Project A five stars as well - how can anyone go wrong with a Jackie Chan film?!?!?!).  But Project A2, IMHO, is much better, with more action and more amazing stunts (too bad I can't give it 6 stars!!). I have the subtitled version, and I've always liked those versions better, rather than the dubbed versions.
Don't think twice - get this movie (especially if you can find the subtitled version!!!).",1074470400,5,525,4.46875
818424,5,6304268432,"This film is just as good as it's previous one. A hialarious scene is when Jackie was fighting the bad guys he had to eat REAL red hot chillies, spit the juice into his hands and rub the juice onto the bad guys eyes'. The plot is quite simiar to the other one but don't worry it's still is a real treat!",1037059200,2,303,3.903225806451613

818426,4,6304268432,"If you can get over the HORRID dubbing and the cheap punch sounds, the  widescreen part, and get over the fact theres is not a whole lot of action  this could be a good adventure movie. I think its worth the money the money  if your not picky about movies. It is not a very great jackie movie. Its  not that he is not good at kung fu its just the bad guys are so hard he  doesn't really get in the rythm of beating up a lot of guys like he does in  project a 1.  I think its a very fun movie if you are patient and  have fun watching it. As for the dubbing, they scream and sqeak. If you  watch it more than once you will get use to this.",959644800,,638,3.701492537313433
818427,4,6304268432,"I was really impressed with this movie! Watching Chan perform his stunts is almost surreal; his sense of humour, grace, and agility is unmatched. If you are a fan of Buster Keaton and martial arts, see this movie!  You  won't be disappointed.",954979200,2,242,4.738095238095238
818428,5,6304268432,"Well, Jackie does it again!  What an excellent movie, however, it isn't as good as Project A, which is my all-time favorite movie.  Having the three brothers (Jackie, Sammo and Yuen Biao) together is always a thrill, and  even though Project A 2 doesn't have Sammo and Biao, it is an excellent  movie with plenty of excitment and, once again, Chan's trademark stunt  work.  It's  a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone, Chan Fan or  not!",947808000,7,447,4.569620253164557
818429,5,6304268432,"Being a huge Chan fan, I had always felt that many of his best films were never brought to the United States. This film proves that theory correct. Chan is on top of his game with unbelievalbe fighting, stunts and some of  the sickest falls you'll ever see. The story is almost a cross between The  Untouchables and a James Bond film. The subtitles are annoying at first,  but quickly become second nature and besides... NOBODY TALKS DURING THE  FIGHT SCENES!  This is Chan in his prime, with an excellent supporting  cast, good humor, and a strong story. A must see for any Jackie Chan fan.",947030400,,591,4.528301886792453
7865998,1,6304268432,I am a huge Jackie Chan fan but this film is horrendous. Bottom of the barrel action mixes with comedy that is never even funny at all. The story and script is terrible. The cinematography and pacing are awful as well. Nothing about this film is redeemable. Skip this one. It actually makes you pine for Rush Hour.,1469232000,,314,4.431034482758621

7866005,4,6304268432,"This 1987 sequel to PROJECT A does away with Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao - both of whom at the time were filming EASTERN CONDORS - but Jackie Chan is back and, really, that's the crucial thing. Jackie acts and directs, stages some slapsticky bits and performs his own stunts... y'know, the usual. Fresh from having put a dent on high seas piracy in PROJECT A, Sergeant Dragon Ma (Chan) is reassigned to shore duty in the Sai Wan district to investigate police corruption, namely a local police inspector named Chun who is so shady he stages his own collars. As the movie reel unspools, Dragon Ma also gets caught up in cute (and not so cute) revolutionaries, operatives from the Manchu government hunting these revolutionaries, a triad lord, and axe-wielding pirates who survived the first movie and are seeking payback from Dragon Ma. And, along the way, Dragon Ma gets discredited when he's framed for a jewelry theft during a gala event. It's a lot to take in, and yet the movie makes it work. Or at least I was able to keep track of who was who and what they were about.

Jackie does his usual hectic scrambling over furniture and effortless scaling of daunting vertical heights. He's acrobatic as ever, as daring as ever. He does get punched here more than I'd like, but I guess Jackie was going for some sort of realism. I've heard folks remark that PROJECT A 2 improves on the original, but I've also heard it the other way. Me, I tend to like the original just a smidge better. But PROJECT A 2 is pretty dang terrific, as well.

Jackie has always strived to inject humor into his films, and sometimes they work, sometimes not so much. Here, he executes a comedic sequence set in a confined space, namely in Maggie Cheung's residence. There's something delightfully Marx Brothers about this bit as several uninvited guests play a deadly form of hide and seek, people looking for certain people while keeping away from other people. A bewildered Maggie Cheung finally asks: ""What are all these people doing in my house?""

The fight scenes are predictably excellent, and Jackie's extended fight with the three Manchu agents is a fabulous set piece. Things get pretty suspenseful when Jackie is flung down a meat crusher pit, and later a wall crashes down on Jackie, and this is his homage to a famous stunt Buster Keaton did in STEAMBOAT BILL JR. But maybe the most impressive risk he takes is chewing a mouthful of red peppers as a sort of mace weapon against the manchus (the red pepper juice gets rubbed in the manchus' eyes). The outtakes show that Jackie really did nosh on those red peppers. Just another way that Jackie suffers for his art.

And, yes, if you don't know by now, you have to stay tuned for the outtakes during the closing credits, as you get behind-the-scenes stuff regarding the stunts. There's also a picture in picture of Jackie belting out a mildly rousing tune in Cantonese. By the way, I'm crossing my fingers for a future Dragon Dynasty release. I'm not at all down with English-dubbed editions, which is the only option provided by Dimension Home Video here.

7866006,3,6304268432,"This movie is okay, it has some cool fight scenes and funny moments but Jackie Chan keeps getting hurt too much, some of the fight scenes are kinda flawed and there's too much drama in this flick. I would've liked this movie better if it didn't have any flaws that harm it a bit. 7.5/10",1274918400,,286,4.218181818181818
7866007,5,6304268432,"Sequels are a capricious lot with most nowhere near the stature of the original. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (such as John Charles) have stated that Project A2 is better than the original, I disagree somewhat but this movie is still a worthwhile follow-up and fits well in the output of brilliant Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s as well as Jackie's own oeuvre. I do wonder how with such an awesome release of great films that his later films were not as good. He only has directed two films in the 1990s and none past that, but he has had much clout in many of the films where he is not officially the director.

Earlier in 1987 Jackie had brain surgery following a disastrous fall in the filming of Armour of God. This encouraged him to work on his next film close to home. This did not encourage him to stop risking his life and his stunt team for our amusement. What resulted is a smash hit at home that eclipsed the original in box office tallies (31 million HK dollars compared to 19 million for the original).

Jackie Chan is once again police officer extraordinaire Dragon Ma and he is ordered to work with ""Three Wan"" Superintendent Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors) who is the only Chinese police officer allowed to have a gun yet is thought to be staging arrests to make himself look better and ignoring the crimes of a triad lord named Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Apparently Chun has too much power to be taken down directly, but he is relieved of the Sai Wan district (now he is ""Two Wan"") which Dragon Ma takes over. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon get a makeover and there is a great scene where three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, attempt to assault Ma to teach him a lesson about complaining about police officers. He soon has that district ship-shape and Tiger Au taken care of. The fight choreography and stunts with Tiger and his men are quite awesome. My favorite stunt was a beautifully brutal fall from the second floor into a large vase and that vase did not appear to be soft.

Meanwhile a couple of subplots are happening. There are pirates who have survived from the first film who are looking for revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) who are trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing Government as well as government operatives who are trying to find these rebels.* Throw in a mixture of corrupt Hong Kong and British Cops as well as legitimate ones and you have a stew that is getting a bit too many ingredients, but yet still seems to coalesce. This works well when there is a Marx Brothers influenced scene (the Marx Brothers have done this type of scene a few times with The Cocoanuts (1929) being the first) at Maggie's place where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from someone else. Many weeks were spent on this scene alone and the effort certainly shows.

There are several faults with the film. There is a certain didactic nature that creeps in the film that seems a bit out-of-place - especially one small speech towards the end that Jackie gives when dealing with the Mainland revolutionaries** and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates that survived from the first film. Female characters are once again underused and underappreciated, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not as satisfied with the continuance of the plot as much as the first film either. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this movie as a cohesive whole. I do not fault the film for not being able to have Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao like the first though (I have heard the main reason behind this was that those two were filming Eastern Condors, but I do wonder if Jackie could have waited a small while to get them to perform in this - they would work together for the last time the following year in Dragons Forever), but they are missed.

I found this to be quite an enjoyable and well-made film and it is rightfully regarded as one of the better comedic action films of the 1980s. This film is also quite good in a few unexpected places. The art direction is superb (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good and the movie looks quite authentic. But the stunts, comedy and the action is what I remember this film for. There is a chase involving a handcuffed Dragon and Chun that is superb (part of the axe throwing scene would be used in Shanghai Noon). The last twenty minutes is full of awe-inspiring hits, falls, chili-peppers as a mouth-mace (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene; you can see him in a lot of mouth pain during the outtakes at the end) and is a worthy conclusion to this movie. The most famous stunt from this sequence is his homage to Buster Keaton from Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section where his head pops through.

Fans of Jackie and/or Hong Kong action cinema should consider this a must own and watch. I certainly do.

I have two editions of this film the Dimension R1 and the Mega Star R0. The Dimension R1 is English Dub only (with many hilarious Aussie voices), has dubtitles, has a Golden Harvest title instead of Golden Way Films, is missing the beginning scenes from the first film (replaced by English titles and credits) and has a little bit cut from the early pirate scene (possibly other cuts but the running times are similar). To me the print does not seem that much better than the Mega Star release which I easily prefer over those two. The OOP R2 HKL release looks to be the best release out there with the ubiquitous Bey Logan commentary and several other extras not found elsewhere. Since it is OOP the prices tend to be a bit high though.

* If you were going to date this film it is important to know that the Empress Dowager who is mentioned in this movie died in 1908 and the assassination of Governor En-ming (not mentioned by name in the subtitles) and the Kiangsi/Kwangtung uprisings took place in December of 1906 so most likely the movie takes place in 1907 (information obtained from the book China's Republican Revolution: the case of Kwangtung, 1895-1913 (1975) by Edward J. M. Rhoads).

**It is interesting to compare these comments with Jackie's later actions and statements which are more situated to Chinese Mainland hegemony than with Hong Kong allegiance. The statement made by the Mainland revolutionary Ms. Pak slightly earlier in this scene ""But this decaying colonial system..."" certainly echoed the current countdown toward the handover. However, Jackie does a fine job of portraying the many ethnic groups fairly. For example, while there are the treacherous British, the Commissioner (Bozidar Smiljanic) is played as a solid individual and certainly cares for his daughter Regina (Regina Kent).",1260835200,,7004,4.660194174757281
