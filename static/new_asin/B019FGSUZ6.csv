7573063,5,B019FGSUZ6,"Becoming Bulletproof is simply about being human and the needs and the desires we all share regardless of our differences.  It's about the endless possibilities for all of us if we all embrace basic human kindness, respect,  inclusivity, and dignity.  All of us have limitations.  This film focuses on the things all of us can do instead of what cannot be done.  It goes far beyond the making of a film and explores real lifelong friendships with people who may be different than ourselves.

Having said all of that this movie will make you laugh, make you cry, make you think, and will thoroughly entertain you and your family. It doesn't try to be preachy, or try to make you feel sorry for anyone.  It's matter of fact and looks at situations from new perspectives.  Although AJ is certainly masterful at articulating his hopes and dreams and what this experience has meant to him, the entire cast each has their own story to tell and their own unique way of sharing what this experience means to them.  It's no surprise that Becoming Bulletproof had won top awards and fans around the country.  This film is not to be missed!",1456185600,,1129,4.628140703517588

7573065,4,B019FGSUZ6,"Becoming Bulletproof is a documentary about a group of disabled adults who work together to make a Hollywood-style film. The film showcases the Zeno Mountain Farm, a nonprofit organization that gathers both disabled and able-bodied actors to produce movies. The groups first foray into the Western genre, the costume drama Bulletproof, is chronicled as we watch the film-within-the film take shape.

This dedicated group meets annually at Zeno Mountain Farm in Vermont to write, produce, and star in original short films. Founded by two brothers and their wives, Zeno Mountains philosophy is to create an inclusive community that builds genuine friendships and transcends stigma and stereotypes. For them, their films aren't about making a statement. As one participant says, Its all about making awesome movies.

Though the community is high-functioning, their disabilities aren't minor, including cerebral palsy and speech impairment. The young star of Bulletproof, Jeremy Vest, is afflicted with Williams syndrome, in which learning disabilities and development delays are balanced by highly social personalities, good verbal abilities and musical talent. Each disabled actor is paired with an abled one, and bonds have formed as the same groups return year after year. Though Zeno had shot several unreleased short films, the goal this time around was to produce a real bona-fide movie to enter into film festivals. The resulting Western is stylish and is framed with modern-day segments.

All participants are treated professionally and are expected to perform assigned tasks on crew or as actors. There is no condescending whatsoever, which makes this documentary an homage to the ability of the group rather than to its shortcomings. A major drawback is the piecemeal way in which we see the Western. It would have been great to see the complete short film. The documentary switches back and forth between the making-of section and the movie being shot. Group members are interviewed, speaking about their disabilities but more enthusiastic about their contribution to Bulletproof.

There are no bonus extras on the widescreen DVD release.",1455926400,4,2146,5.454819277108434

7573076,5,B019FGSUZ6,"Fun, human and ultimately deeply touching documentary about Zeno Mountain Farms  a group that makes independent films mixing physically and mentally disabled performers with able-bodied actors.  This year they're making a comic western called Bulletproof Jackson.

The documentary avoids the obvious traps of mawkishness and over-sentimentality by focusing on the challenged actors themselves with open eyes and heart, with humor, and without resorting to pushing buttons.  The film never denies that this summer spent film-making is only a brief respite from the struggles these folks face, and that they will spend their lives dealing with both the challenges of their own limitations, and of a society that turns away from them instead of asking them to take part.  Thats why the included discussions of human, earthy issues, like love and sex are so great.  This isn't about treating these actors as saints or other, but about realizing that trapped behind whatever walls they face are people with the same wants, needs, strengths and weaknesses, as the so-called able-bodied.

We get to know a whole bunch of folks in the films brief 80 minute length, but we focus most on AJ, an extremely bright and charismatic young man suffering from cerebral palsy.  He is tremendously articulate about his own life and future.  Heres a man with talent and brains, who is trapped living at home with his mother, and who is unlikely to ever be able to truly be on his own.  We see how much this chance to travel and have a moment to himself in the spotlight means to him, and yet the film (and the man) won't deny the bittersweetness that this respite is only temporary, and he will return to where he started from when the film is done.  (And, as AJ himself says, he knows hell never be a movie star, but what about those roles that might call for someone with his condition?  Its one of the areas where diversity in films and TV most lags, and without much reason.).

Both the film and its people defy and transcend the expectations one might have going in.",1456358400,,2051,4.8091168091168095

8745044,3,B019FGSUZ6,"Ill give it three stars just because i have to give something, and i don't want to be unfair in either direction. Im not against this project, or the project it is about. Im sure its a very touching story. I do however feel the need to share my opinion, after reading a synopsis that said this ""raises the question, why don't we see more disabled actors?"" I can answer that right now, and then some. We don't see them more because there just isn't parts that call for it. There are not a lot of stories written with disabled characters. Are we as a society now expected to write scripts with the intention and sole purpose of putting disabled actors on screen? Thats ridiculous! Another reason, producers and directors want the best performer they can get for their money. If you can have gary siniese, or cuba gooding jr. Pretend to be missing a limb, why would you use an inferior actor just because they are actually missing a limb? Also ridiculous! Film is one of the few industries that rightfully has full power to discriminate against actors for any reason they see fit. Its their vision and they cant nor should be forced to compromise because someone thinks its unfair to a certain sect of society. My last point is the same point i make when every show and movie feels the need to have gay characters. Its a point that may change regionally. Point is that in real life its just not that common. How many one legged people does the average person see in a lifetime? Im 32 and ive probably seen less than 20. So why would should they be prominent in movies that aren't specifically about them? When they're not prominent in real life. As for the gay thing, since im sure it offends someone. I have personally known maybe five gays in my life. As far as actually knowing someone, they're less prominent in my life than disabled people because you cant just point them out. So it seems odd to me that every main character i see on screen these days knows at least one gay person. I can probably easily find 100 people who don't know even one gay person. So why can i find less than five people on film or tv that don't know a gay person? Whole point being, theres a lot of legitimate reason we don't see certain minorities more on screen. Theres nothing wrong with it. Not every single different type of person has to be granted magic wishes in this world! You might as well start asking why we don't see more non actors acting? Why don't we see more released inmate actors in movies? Movies done in all sign language? Lets see some stuff directed by drunk people? Slippery slope folks. Quit trying to make the whole world think they're special. Because when everyone is special, no one is.",1474502400,,2696,4.448484848484848
