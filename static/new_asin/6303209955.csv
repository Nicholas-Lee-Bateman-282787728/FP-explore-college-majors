595166,1,6303209955,"As everyone else has said, this is a wonderful movie (tho' I haven't seen the DVD version) but I'd like to add a couple of points. One reviewer said Alec Guinness reminds him of that other great character actor Alistair Sim. I think this is quite deliberate on Guinness's part. In a recent tv documentary Sim's daughter said that Sim was often congratulated for his acting in 'The Ladykillers'. We don't know whether this delighted or infuriated the older man, but I'm sure he would take it as a compliment.
The other point is that The Ladykillers projects the cosy world of post-1945 Britain, shabby, eccentric and faded perhaps, but essentially decent, and hints at the poison in its heart. This is really a dangerous world where the good survive only by accident. Director Mackendrick later went to America and let his cynicism rip in the magnificent 'Sweet Smell of Success'. Watch the two back to back and see a great artist at work with other great artists, but in two different worlds.",1028505600,5,992,4.7398843930635834
595167,5,6303209955,This is a great movie.  This is the only movie my husband will watch more than once!  It is his favorite movie.  We love it.,1008806400,,124,3.88
595168,5,6303209955,"This is a truly brilliant black comedy. Alec Guiness in brilliant form and the first movie appearance of Peter Sellers.
Storyline and execution make this the classic comedy heist movie.
Many of England's top comedy characters are sprinkled through the movie including Frankie Howard, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom and many more. If you like British comedy you owe it to yourself to see this one!",1007942400,,391,5.030769230769231
595169,4,6303209955,"Alec Guinness leads an inept group of thieves who cleverly steal a considerable amount of cash, but find one stumbling block to their success - a little old lady. She is the landlord of the house that Guinness is staying in, under the guise of being a professor and his gang are also professors practicing for a concert. He actually uses her in his plan, but that proves to be all the help she gives. Katie Johnson, as the old lady, is hysterical without much effort, exactly right on target as the proper, overly helpful, good citizen that finds herself mixed up in a crime that will cause her great personal scandal. The scene where she tries to keep apart her tea party friends and the gang is very, very funny. Guinness is, of course, his usual comic genius, and his gang all score too, including a young Peter Sellers. This is a perfect example of the ""little"" films that England turned out during the Forties and Fifties that remain just as entertaining today as they did when first produced. It's a terrific example of black comedy.",999216000,10,1039,4.561497326203209
595170,5,6303209955,"This film runs on two levels: the first is the evil genius' odd gang of robbers who are planning their first-ever job. The second, is the little old landlady who believes she must report all to the police who in turn never take her reports seriously. Guinness, as the would-be crime-lord, is a master of the apparently dastardly mobster role while at the same time building an impression of total inept team-building at its most amusing.  He rents the upstairs rooms from a little old lady whose house is right next to a busy suburban railway track and overpass. Guinness rents the rooms under a pretext. His gang is a string quartet, Guinness tells her, getting ready for a huge concert.
When the day comes for the big heist, all goes awry after the robbers bring the Bank of England loot back to their rented rooms.  One-by-one the villains are laid to rest and the million Pounds are left on the bed (in a cello case.) Naturally, the landlady discovers the money, but when she makes her report to the police and discribes the cello case's contents, the local police sergeant believes it another foundationless figment of her imagination and kindly tells her that she is perfectly enttitled to keep what she has found.",997833600,,1220,4.696261682242991
595171,5,6303209955,"A comedy from another place and another time, that right now seems so long ago and far away, ""The Ladykillers,"" directed by Alexander Mackendrick, stars Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom, and stands as a perfect example of how charming, delightful, civilized and yes, ""funny,"" a film can be when approached with intelligence and respect for the audience.  Guinness plays Professor Marcus, who puts together a gang to pull off the ""perfect"" robbery he has concocted.  But, as it always is with all things ""perfect,"" it quickly goes awry for the gang, thanks to the involvement of an old lady (Katie Johnson), in whose house Marcus has taken rooms.  And as the situation in which the gang finds themselves escalates as they try to put things to rights, the audience is treated to an exemplary piece of truly humorous and memorable cinema.  Guinness anchors the farce with a superb characterization (even to altering his appearance with false teeth) of the Professor.  It's a prime example of just how great a character actor Guinness was; as in all of his films, he creates a total character of Marcus, inside and out, beginning with the attitude and right on down to the smallest details that many actors would deem insignificant.  There is a studied consistency he maintains throughout the film that would stand up to the closest scrutiny; it is not by accident that he is considered by many to be one of greatest actors of our times.  And how great to see the youthful Peter Sellers in one of his earliest roles.  Watch closely and you can see traces of the unique mannerisms that would mark his career; the slight hesitations, the inward, subtle consideration of the status quo and the sense he conveys in a split second that Murphy's Law is about to go into effect.  He makes Harry, a member of the hapless gang, a memorable character.  Herbert Lom (as Louis, in this precursor to his pairing with Sellers some twenty years later in the ""Pink Panther"" movies), Parker (Major Courtney) and Danny Green (One-Round) round out the gang, the likes of which you have never seen before, nor in all probability will ever see again, because-- as the saying goes-- they just don't make `em like this any more.  The supporting cast includes Jack Warner (The Superintendent), Philip Stainton (Sergeant), Kenneth Connor (Cab Driver) and Ewan Roberts (Constable).  Clever and sophisticated, ""The Ladykillers"" is a testimony to just how grand and uplifting comedy can be, without resorting to the gross and often unpalatable ""humor"" upon which so many of today's contemporary comedies seem to depend.  Not to say that today's comedies are no good; it's just that they so often lack the esteem and the ""humanity""-- not to mention the longevity-- which lends itself to a film such as this one.  Movies like this will be around long after most of the addle-brained Saturday Night Live induced fare is gone and forgotten.  With the added bonus of having Guinness and Sellers together, this is a true classic in every sense of the word.  This is what the magic of the movies is really all about.",978566400,117,3103,4.826415094339622
595172,5,6303209955,"One of the funniest comedies ever made.  The word droll was invented to describe this picture.  A flawless cast (Guinness, Herbert Lom, Peter  Sellars etc) plays it straight and deadpan...and the find-of-all-finds is  Katie Johnson as the old lady (who I believe was not a professional actress  prior to this). As the brilliant criminal mastermind, The Professor  (Guinness), and his band of inept henchman become undone by ""Mrs.  Lopsided"" the irony and amusement build to a perfect ending.  They  used to be able to do this stuff in 97 minutes!  It's a gem, don't miss it!  Glad I bought a tape from Amazon while they were still producing them.

Star Wars fans should see  this, if only to understand why Alec Guinness was able to become Obi Wan so  effortlessly, his skill as an actor was already finely honed at the time of  this great film.

Ealing Studios output from the 1940s and the 1950s helped define what was arguably the Golden Age for British Cinema. It fostered great directors such as Alexander MacKendrick and Robert Hamer, while giving stars such as Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers the chance to shine.

With iconic performances from Sir Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom, THE LADYKILLERS is quintessential Ealing Studios. Direct Alexander MacKendricks film centres on a criminal gang planning their next job, who find themselves boarding with an innocent old lady who thinks they are musicians. When the gang set out to kill Mrs. Wilberforce, they run into one problem after another, and get what they deserve. Alexander MacKendricks last film as director before his move to Hollywood. THE LADYKILLERS remains one of the best British comedies ever made.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: BAFTA Awards: Win: Best Actress in a Leading Role for Katie Johnson. Win: Best British Screenplay for William Rose. Nominated: Writing Original Screenplay for William Rose. Nominated: Best Film, British Film and Film from any Source. The comedian Frankie Howerd has a small role as an agitated barrow boy, as does Kenneth Connor as a taxi driver. A young Stratford Johns (Charlie Barlow from BBC TV Series Z-Cars) plays the driver of the security van that gets robbed. Mrs. Wilberforce's house, No. 57, was a set built at the western end of Frederica Street, in Barnsbury, North London. In the 1970s a new housing estate was built in that area. However, the views from her house are of Argyle Street, some distance away, with the tower of St Pancras railway station in the background. The film poster was by Reginald Mount.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: One of the most popular films produced by Ealing Studios during their peak years, THE LADYKILLERS [1955] is a delightful black comedy that has aged much better than some of the other Ealing Studios entertainments from the same period. For one thing, the clever script by William Rose, which was of course was nominated for an OOSCAR and is so impeccably British, conjuring up a portrait of post-war London that is both idealised and of its time. And the central premise is hard to top. A gang of thieves, headed by Professor Marcus [Sir Alec Guinness], and takes two rooms at a boarding-house run by the eccentric Mrs. Wilberforce [Katie Johnson]. Here they pretend to be a practicing string quartet as a cover for their true intention is a security van robbery. Although the gang successfully carry off their heist, the criminals are eventually undone by their own greed and their various, unsuccessful attempts to murder their meddling landlady who remains oblivious to their crime or does she?

A gang of robbers posing as a string quartet hole up in seedy Kings Cross in THE LADYKILLERS, and we discover a glimpse of a vanished London in the past. Alexander Mackendricks 1955 black comedy crime caper THE LADYKILLERS, is imbued with the seedy, grimy urban frontier feel that the Kings Cross district oozed in 1950s England and the last of the brilliant Ealing Studios Comedies, and the film centres on a rag-tag gang of crooks, led by Sir Alec Guinnesss sinister Professor Marcus, who pull off an audacious security van robbery at Kings Cross station. At the time of filming, Kings Cross station and its immediate vicinity was a very far cry from the gentrified area it has only recently become.

The gang, posing as a string quartet, holed up in a lodging room in the area to plan the robbery. However, they meet their match in the form of their apparently frail old landlady, Mrs Wilberforce, charmingly portrayed by Katie Johnson. As the 1950s dawned, that part of North London was thick with coal grime from the constant flow of steam trains in and out of the capitals busiest station, and THE LADYKILLERS was made a year before lawmakers introduced the Clean Air Act. As a major gateway to and from the rest of Great Britain, Kings Cross station was surrounded by myriad boarding houses, vans transporting sacks of wages unloaded from trains, and trolley buses choking the streets. It all made the likelihood of the crime happening at Kings Cross station all the more authentic.

The setting for Mrs Wilberforces house was built so that it would have no perfect right angles and everything was designed to look dilapidated and broken. And Alexander Mackendrick said he wanted the house to be dwarfed by the grim landscape of railway yards and screaming express trains as an anachronism in the contemporary world. So the set was built not in Ealing Studios, but on a vacant lot at the end of a through-road named Frederica Street, about a mile to the north of Kings Cross. But the view out of the windows and the street was actually Argyle Street, closer to the station.

For the films set-piece robbery, Alexander Mackendrick and his crew began shooting on the cobbled streets behind Kings Cross station at the junction of Battle Bridge Road and Goods Way. The famous Victorian Gasometers loom large in the shots while several scenes, including one with Mrs Wilberforce, are shot in the cavernous Victorian station itself. Other streets in the area used include Cheney Road and St Chads Street, while a red telephone box on Vernon Square is used by Guinnesss professor to make phone calls to a fellow gang member. And the Copenhagen rail track tunnel, whose walls can still be seen today, provides the location for the films grisliest scene when the body of gang member Harry, played by Peter Sellers, is disposed of. THE LADYKILLERS marked Mackendricks last film adventure on British streets before he took off for the sunnier, altogether less grimy streets of Hollywood.

According to the film's producer that in his autobiography Michael Balcon Presents . . .  A Lifetime of Films, screenwriter William Rose ""literally dreamed up THE LADYKILLERS the germ of the idea came to him while he was asleep and at a time when he confessed that his brain was barren of ideas. He had been working at high pressure and felt creatively exhausted. Happily for us, he recalled the dream one day while talking with [director Alexander] ""Sandy"" MacKendrick, and so was born the story of the somewhat pixilated old lady getting involved in the doings of an extraordinary gang of crooks."" The interesting thing about THE LADYKILLERS, which is set in a precisely detailed world of English manners and tradition, is the fact that William Rose was actually an American. Who defected to Canada prior to World War II and joined the army there, later coming to England where he attempted to enter the film industry. He eventually went to work at Ealing where he worked on Genevieve [1953], Touch and Go [1955] and other features.

Other cast members who would go on to greater fame and fortune after THE LADYKILLERS, were Kenneth Connor and Frankie Howard, who appeared in several of the popular British Carry On comedy films and, of course, Herbert Lom, who would team up with Peter Sellers years later, playing his nemesis in a series of the Pink Panther films. THE LADYKILLERS marked Alexander MacKendrick's final film for Ealing Studios; he soon departed for America where he would direct Sweet Smell of Success in 1957, and a film which was a complete departure from his forte, especially British comedy films. In 2004, the Coen Brothers remade The Ladykillers with Tom Hanks and moved the setting from London to Biloxi, Mississippi and was a total ghastly disaster and should have never ever of been contemplated and to try and improve over the original 1955 THE LADYKILLERS, as it was a total insult to do so.

Blu-ray Video Quality  THE LADYKILLERS offers a stunning knockout transfer for an Ealing Studios film of this vintage. This new Blu-ray  release adds information back with wider black bars to each side, and accurately displays the restored negatives in the manner they were originally shot generate an image capable of filling a greater portion of our TV widescreen display. STUDIOCANALs new 2015 release transfer looks even much improved for its 1955 age. Fine object detail comes close to the clarity of a modern production, and it's a natural element of the period in which the classic film was shot. Regarding the black levels, contrast, and colouring, the film has never looked better. In the end, fans of THE LADYKILLERS and classic cinema in general will be very pleased with the stunning visual upgrade on this 2015 STUDIOCANALs Blu-ray release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This very welcome upgrade with the 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio, and offers a very subtle increase in brilliant clarity and has brilliant gains in audio balance. Listening to the dialogue Mono Audio track, I never noticed a shred of distortion, hiss, or dropout, and the vocal nuances of each character were reproduced with a high level of accuracy. Environmental sound effects are well-balance with the rest of the elements in the mix without coming across overbearing, and the whimsical musical score by first-time composer Tristram Cary adds a brilliant touch of character to the overall track. In my assessment, this is a perfectly capable audio experience that remains true to the nature of the original sound recording of this upgraded 2015 STUDIOCANAL release.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Philip Kemp: Film historian Philip Kemp delivers a well-researched commentary, although his delivery is rather dry. It felt too much like he was reading form a script rather than reacting to what he saw, which is understandable considering all the information he offers, but at the same time after a while he starts rambling on about other films relating to the Ealing Studios and is very off putting. The audio commentary track is somewhat dry at times, but the wealth of information collected by Kemp is astounding. From conversations on the set to anecdotes regarding Alexander Mackendrick's compulsive desire for perfection, Philip Kemp literally transports viewers back to 1955. One interesting fact we hear about, is that they were going to hire Sir Richard Attenborough because of his early career as an actor in British films, but in the end they changed their minds. Alexander MacKendrick was keen to get Peter Sellers because of his time in the BBC Radio The Goon Show and the way he uses his voice to create different characters and as a bonus, Peter Sellers does all the voices for Mrs. Wilberforces 3 parrots. A word of warning, because this audio commentary by Philip Kemp is in 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio, when he stops his rambling coherent audio commentary and allows the film to proceed in hearing the actors speak in the film, you will notice the actors lip sync is out and luckily at times you only get brief moments like this, as hearing the voices not working with the lips is very off putting. And so ends this audio commentary that was partly interesting, but a lot of the time Philip Kemp goes off rambling in lots of different directions on information about other films that came out of the Ealing Studios, but instead should stick to information about THE LADYKILLERS as Philip Kemp certainly likes the sound of his own voice and after a while you wish he would be silent more often now and again. So all in all I can only give a 5 out of 10 star rating for his effort in doing this audio commentary.

Special Feature: Introduction by filmmaker Terry Gilliam [2012] [1080i] [1.37:1] [2:58] This brief interview, that was filmed in an empty studio, is with the talented director Terry Gilliam, who demonstrates the level of appreciation he has for the classic film productions of the Ealing Studios, yet he barely scratches the surface behind his reasoning. But he informs us that when lived in the San Fernando Valley in California his youth is 1955, and the area where he lived was very boring, flat and bleached out, but when THE LADYKILLERS was released in his local cinema he felt London looked very exotic city landscape, compared to the boring landscape of the San Fernando Valley. We also find out that the Kings Cross location of the film, was where he first lodged when he moved to the UK and in fact was very near to where they filmed THE LADYKILLERS. Terry Gilliam informs us that he loved the films moody lighting and the characters were always in the shadows, which gives the impression of a constant threat and that something could go terribly wrong. Terry Gilliam also praises the director Alexander MacKendricks use of the camera, especially when the little old ladies are milling about in the hallway. Also another reason he loves the film is because it has brilliant acting performances, as well as brilliant comedy timing and especially that they are real characters with real ideas, real passions, real dreams, real frustrations and of course, ultimately real greed. Which at this point the filming ends abruptly. Sadly this is far too short, but still interesting. But you can see why Terry Gilliam loves the film THE LADYKILLERS.

Special Feature: Forever Ealing [2002] [1080i] [1.37:1] [49:36] This Documentary is about the history of the British Ealing Studios, from its beginnings in 1902, that is located in a quiet suburb of West London, where all the funniest British Comedy Films were conjured up. This Documentary celebrates the history and influence of England's Ealing Studios with the documentary of Forever Ealing [2002]. Narrated by Daniel Day-Lewis, whose grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, ran the studio during its heyday, the documentary explores the enduring popularity of the quirky studio responsible for defining British comedy on the big screen. The documentary features interviews with Ealing Studios' stars, craftsmen, and contemporary filmmakers and actors who were influenced by the studio, as well as clips from many of the great films produced at Ealing. It also explores the studio's history from its origins in 1902 through its most prolific and popular decades of the 1940s and '50s, when it produced such films as THE LADYKILLERS [1955], the story of innocence triumphing over evil as an elderly lady turns the table on her would-be assassins; THE LAVENDER HILL MOB [1951], a tongue-in-cheek crime comedy starring Sir Alec Guinness as a gold thief who eventually gets arrested for his troubles; and KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS [1949], in which Sir Alec Guinness plays numerous roles as different members of the snobbish D'Ascoyne family, each of whom eventually get exactly what they deserve at the hands of a disowned relative. The documentary also traces the Ealing Studios historic production of films and then the BBC television productions output and ends by exploring the contemporary rebirth of Ealing Studios as the home for films including, An Ideal Husband [1999] and The Importance of Being Earnest [2002], as well as the desire of the present owners to re-create the spirit of the Ealing Studios from the 1940s and '50s. Interviewees include Ealing Studios Googie Withers [Actress] and John McCallum [Actor] watching their own films and commenting on their romantic relationship on and off screen. OSCAR winning screenwriter Tibby E. B. Clarke and cinematographer Douglas Slocombe shares their stories about the creative atmosphere at Ealing Studios, the main goal of craftsmanship and quality filmmaking, as well as the contributions made by those who worked on films for the studio. We also get other contributions from the great British luminaries like Jill Balcon [Widow of Michael Balcon]; Lord Richard Attenborough [Director] discusses how the films made at Ealing Studios have entertained and influenced them. Sir John Mills [Actor]; Derek Bond [Actor]; Martin Scorsese [Director] relates that KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS was an influence on his film Goodfellas [1990]. Philip Kemp [Film Historian]; Stephen Frears [Director]; Terry Gilliam [Director] discusses the inspiration THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT [1951] which gave him the stolen idea for his film BRAZIL [1985]. John Landis [Director] shares his views of the film studio system, including the thought that ""Ealing Studios created wit of an extremely refined, stylised level."" Barnaby Thompson [Producer] who is the New Studio Head of Ealing Studios. Colin Firth [Actor]; Rupert Everett [Actor] and John McCallum [Producer/Actor]. We also get Clips, including the only few seconds remaining of Ealing Studios first feature, the film 60 Years A Queen [1902];  The Captive Heart [1946]; SCOTT OF THE ANTARCTIC [1948]; The Big Blockade [1941]; THE CRUEL SEA [1953] and PASSPORT TO PIMLICO [1949]. But one last bit of bonus we get, is where we are informed that Peter Sellers while filming THE LADYKILLERS produced his own personal audio film trailer via a reel-to-reel tape recorder, to entertain the cast and crew and it is the first time it has been heard, and while it is broadcast, we get a last look round the Ealing Studios. Directed by Andrew Snell. Produced by Andrew Solomon, Avril MacRory, Brendan Hughes, Caroline Thomas and Ron Halpern. Music by Tom Green. Cinematography by John Howarth. This special documentary was by Silver Apples Media in association with STUDIOCANAL and Channel 4 Television Corporation.

Special Feature: Interview with Screenwriter/Producer Allan Scott [2015] [1080i] [1.77:1] [49:36] Here we get the intimate thoughts of Allan Scott and talks extensively about the film THE LADYKILLERS. Allen Scott says people say the film is a horror comic, but disagrees, but instead says it is a funny film. Allan Scott says the little old lady fascinated him and also says that Alexander MacKendrick always said that comedy was the best way of not making life unbearable and that his films were extraordinary towards humanity and also said, that laughter without sympathy is intolerable and that laughter at yourself and your pain and faults is the best kind of joke. Allan praises Sir Alec Guinness and says he gave a wonderful performance, but also liked the other characters in the film and that none of Alexander MacKendrisks films has dated and that he was very fussy and critical of his film, but at the same found him to be a very sweet guy, but also had a troubled life, both professionally and personally, but was also a brilliant teacher, and students worshipped him. And so all in all ends a fascinating insight into the direct Alexander MacKendrick and especially finding out about his brilliant work directing classic Ealing Studios films at Ealing Studios, but most important Allan Scott tells it all in a very interesting and fascinating way.

Special Feature: Interview with Director Terence Davies [2015] [1080i] [1.77:1] [13:48] With this second special interview we again get the intimate thoughts of Terence Davis and also talks extensively about the film THE LADYKILLERS. Terrence Davies was a student under the direction of Alexander MacKendrick and praised him greatly and said what a wonderful teacher he was, especially when in Alexander MacKendricks classes he would put on films like The Third Man and discuss its merits and techniques of filming and was a total revelation. Terrence Davies says Alexander MacKendricks films had a great influence in his directing technique, and especially with the use of Technicolor, and of course raves over the film THE LADYKILLERS, which he equally tells us that he adores the film. Terrence Davies loved Sir Alec Guinness as Professor Marcus, but most of all we are informed that Alexander MacKendrick thought Sir Alec Guinness was a genius in the film and also praises the actress and says her performance was gorgeous and instantly feel in love with her character, but sadly when the film THE LADYKILLERS was released Katie Johnson sadly passed away and never got to see the film. Terrence Davies mentions director Robert Hamer, who made Kind Hearts and Coronets and felt it was his greatest comedy film and and  points out that Alexander MacKendrick and Robert Hamers films were all about class, plus also about revenge, and also feel life has robbed them of their privileges and we hoped they would get away with it. Terrence Davies feels THE LADYKILLERS has not dated at all, especially as it has a cosy effect about it, but it also has something different about it. So ends another fascinating interview special, especially with Terence Davies who is very interesting and engaging person and is well worth a view, especially hearing all the informative stuff about the director Alexander MacKendrick.

Special Feature: Interview with Screenwriter Ronald Harwood [2015] [1080i] [1.77:1] [7:14] With this third and final special interview we again get the intimate thoughts of Ronald Harwood and also talks extensively about the film THE LADYKILLERS. Ronald Harwood informs us that Alexander MacKendrick was the first director he has ever worked for, and was a very charming experience and became a very good friend to Alexander MacKendrick and was co-writer to the film A High Wind in Jamaica. Ronald Harwood tells us that Alexander MacKendrick had a good sense when it came to a story, which is very important, but there was a definite a dark side to  Alexander MacKendricks personality. Ronald Harwood is asked if THE LADYKILLERS has dated and says, Oh No, because you can see it has not dated, but mentions the ghastly American re-make that has definitely dated. And so ends another fascinating and brilliant interesting interview special.

Special Feature: Locations Feature [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [7:14] Here we have the BBC Radio 4's Alan Dein [Broadcaster and Oral Historian] with his special anniversary film talk tour and we also get screenings of some of the iconic comedy clips of the film THE LADYKILLERS pointing out at the same time where it was actually filmed. It is 60 years since the release of this iconic classic film comedy by Ealing Studios the tour starts off in Argyle Street that was repeatedly used throughout the film and also the main view of Mrs. Wilberforces house and was just a prop that was built in Frederica Street, London. We also find out that the famous Red Telephone Box that is used by the Professor and the Major that is no longer there. Next location is St. Chad's Street, Kings Cross, London WC1H 8BD, where the Major bumps into Peter Sellers and where the police delivers the trunk full of the stolen money. The next location is Field Street, Kings Cross, London WC1X 9DA and this is where the abandoned car was filmed. Allen Dein also gives us more views around the Kings Cross area where a lot of the filming was done and the director Alexander MacKendrick loved the area a lot in 1955, as it still had the Dickensian look of the 1880s and the spot where Mrs. Wilberforce house was built and was on top of the Copenhagen Tunnel where the actors get bumped off and at that point we get few moments near the end of the film and without warning suddenly ends abruptly, but despite this, Allen Dein does a brilliant job with this special feature.

Special Feature: Audio Interview with Tom Pevsner [1926-2014] [1 Hour 31 minutes and 29 seconds] With this particular interview, we are not informed who conducted the interview, but I can tell you it is totally boring, as the interviewer is totally boring and has not done his homewaork. Tom Pevsner was born on 2nd October, 1926 in Dresden, Germany, and was the son of the distinguished architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner. His parents were German and were originally from Russia, and due to a decline in the fur trade, moved to Europe. Tom Pevsner eventually entered the film industry under the direction of Sir Michael Balcon at the famed Ealing Studios. He eventually became a third assistant director and moved up to first Assistant Director with Ealing Studios productions, such as THE LADYKILLERS [1955]. Tom Pevsner later served as Associate Producer on such films as A High Wind in Jamaica [1965], Fred Zinnemann's JULIA [1977] and John Badham's DRACULA [1979]. Tom Pevsner served as Executive Producer for the first and only time on the 1995 relaunch of the James Bond films. But at the end we get a notice informing us this was in memory of Tom Pevsner, who passed away on the 18th August, 2014.

Special Feature: Audio Interview with David Peers [1 Hour 32 minutes and 34 seconds] Once again we have this idiot doing another audio interview. David Peers was born in 1924 in London in the Notting Hill Gate area, which was his home and working area for most of his life, but now resides in the countryside. When he as 9 years of age his Parents sent him up to a boarding school in Yorkshire, which always departed from Kings Cross Station. But he informs us of a tragic fire that happened with one of carriages caught fire on the journey up to Yorkshire, where six boys were killed, but luckily David had a lucky escape. In 1942 he entered the army and spent the rest of that period in the Second World War. He is asked how he became involved with the film industry, which all came about via his father, who was one of the earliest pioneers in the film industry in. David Peers then went onto the Gate Film Studios, and then moved onto the Ealing. David Peers talk about Ealing Studios and Michael Balcon who had a moral outlook. David Peers praised the direct Alexander MacKendrick and David Peers does most of the talking and is a joy to hear and is also totally fascinating and very informative on his life and times in the film industry and it is a totally sheer delight and joy of 1 hour 32 minutes and 34 seconds.

Special Feature: Cleaning Up The Ladykillers [2015] [1080p] [1.37:1] [5:06] This feature had general dirt and sparkle throughout the film, but also some very dirty optical images. It also suffered in places from some very severe blue staining. Nearly half of the feature film had static dirt; and these particular scenes were run the Regional Fill Filter to automatically remove the dirt. The Clean Up reveals what actions were taken to clean up the imperfections, and split-screens show original/restored comparisons, but there is no sound and it is an amazing bit of work was done and the team should be quite proud of their professional work.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [2015] [1080p] [1.37:1] You get to view 27 stunning rare Black-and-White Promotional images of never before behind-the-scenes look at the filming of THE LADYKILLERS, plus some rare images of the special THE LADYKILLERS Street Tea Party in celebration of the Ealing Studios filming and you get to see some of the stars helping out.

Theatrical Trailer [1955] [1080p] [1.37:1] [2:34] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for THE LADYKILLERS and it is a totally brilliant trailer and is also really brilliant presentation especially with the voice over announcer and is as good as the film itself!

Finally, THE LADYKILLERS is a must-own this 2015 upgraded Blu-ray title, especially for all fans of classic Ealing Studios dark comedy films. Because it combines lasting appeal, a first-rate professional cast actors, exceptional directing, and very clever witty dialogue, and the film's relevance is undeniable. This new high-definition presentation offers a definitive technical presentation that exceeds all prior previous Blu-ray versions in every possible way, while also managing to deliver an extensive brilliant supplemental package of value-added material. If you've been waiting for the right time to buy THE LADYKILLERS this special upgraded 2015 Blu-ray release, then this is the one for you. Very Highly Recommended!

595614,5,6303209955,"Hilarious & quirky THE LADYKILLERS captures the gloom and grit of London after World War II. Mrs. Wilberforce (aka Mrs. lopsided, who nobody takes seriously) prevails on behalf of all the modern democracies.

This drole 1955 black comedy is from the Ealing Studio. Five diverse oddball criminal types planning a bank robbery rent rooms on a cul-de-sac from an octogenarian widow under the pretext that they are classical musicians. The Ladykillers mocks both the criminals and the authorities with its unlikely octogenarian heroine Mrs ""lop-sided"" Wilberforce.  The heist is carried out despite the pleasantly confused old lady's constant, well-intentioned, and funny interruptions, she gradually realizes her part in it, and justice prevails with lots of giggles. Guiness, sporting a large overbite and flyaway hair, is charmingly devious as the gang leader, but it is the inimitable Katie Johnson who steals the show. She's so likable and convincing, completely inhabiting the role of the befuddled, sweet landlady who is blithely unaware she is surrounded by criminals.  The coup-de-grace is when Mrs. Lopsided tries to return the stolen money to the police.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy classic British comedy.",1430784000,,1225,5.465608465608466

595717,5,6303209955,"""The Ladykillers"" is a landmark British comedy from 1955 with a host of British comedians, including Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom, Cecil Parker, and Danny Green. The cunning gang of professional criminals plans a heist, using rented premises at the home of a little old widow lady (Katie Johnson) for their headquarters.

The plan of mastermind Alec Guinness goes off like clockwork, but the tiny landlady discovers their nefarious deed, and forbids them to leave until she can figure out what to do about it. So of course she must be eliminated, hence the title ""The Ladykillers"". Landlady Mrs. Wilberforce is now pitted against these five criminal minds, in an elemental contest of right and wrong.

This comedy of errors is peopled by some of the finest British actors of the era, with Alec Guinness (Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia) leading the pack. A young Peter Sellers appears in one of his earliest film roles, while Herbert Lom (The Pink Panther) provides a sinister and somber presence, and Cecil Parker (The Court Jester) is the genteel retired ""Major"" now dabbling in crime.

This film is typical of the good-natured British comedies of the late 1940s and 1950s from Ealing Studios and the J. Arthur Rank studio. They feature great casting and writing, with a charming whimsy that marked the era. Such gentle and well-crafted humor has long since disappeared almost entirely from modern films. For a delightful evening of entertainment, watch The Ladykillers and see what British film comedy was like in the 1950s. This movie has been completely restored and re-mastered in the past two years, providing a like-new view of a sixty-year-old classic.",1394150400,,1687,5.039426523297491
595718,5,6303209955,"Entertaining for its time, and even now...I enjoyed watching Alec Guinness play the sinister master mind behind the robbery.

595819,5,6303209955,"The Ladykillers (Alexander Mackendrick, 1955, 97')

Five diverse oddball criminal types planning a bank robbery rent rooms on a cul-de-sac from an octogenarian widow under the pretext that they are classical musicians. The Ladykillers mocks both the criminals and the authorities with its unlikely octogenarian heroine Mrs ""lop-sided"" Wilberforce.

Ealing's great comedies captured the essence of post-war Britain, both in their evocation of a land once blighted by war, now doggedly and optimistically rising again from the ashes, and in their mordant yet graceful humour. They portray a country with an antiquated class system whose crumbling conventions are being undermined by a new spirit of individual opportunism. Arguably their greatest asset is Alec Guinness, whose multifaceted performances are the keystone upon which Ealing built its biting, often macabre, yet always elegant comedies.

Main titles were: Hue and Cry (1947), Another Shore (1948), Passport to Pimlico (1949), Whisky Galore! (1949), Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), A Run for Your Money (1949), The Magnet (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), Meet Mr Lucifer (1953), The Love Lottery (1954), The Maggie (1954), The Ladykillers (1955), Who Done It? (1956), Barnacle Bill (1957), Davy (1957).

In fact, many of the films were built around a repertory group of actors, screenwriters (""All the exuberance of Chaucer without, happily, any of the concomitant crudities of his period""), directors and technicians. Directors were Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer, Charles Frend, Anthony Pelissier and Henry Cornelius. Notable actors who became prolific in these films included Stanley Holloway, Alec Guinness, Raymond Huntley and Alastair Sim. A number of actors, such as Philip Stainton and Edie Martin. also appeared recurringly in smaller roles.

Many factors contribute to the success of these films - including fine music scores, uniquely evocative locations (the environs of King's Cross in Ladykillers, for example), and writing that always displays Ealing's unique perspective on British social mores.

595874,5,6303209955,"Ladykillers occupies a quirky cinematic space halfway between Mary Poppins and Psycho, a delight from the golden age of Ealing Studios which will remind you of the Sgt.-Pepper-charms of British eccentricity. But this is a movie with a dark, ironic energy which might well have influenced Stanley Kubrick's directorial style, too. The dark, 1955 comedy was directed by Alexander MacKendrick, beautifully restored and released on Blu-ray by Studio Canal.

A talkative spinster-widow named Mrs. Wilburforce -- who nobody takes seriously, most especially the police -- takes on a lodger, a certain ""Professor"" Marcus, in her rickety old house perched over a smoky London railway yard. Played by Alec Guinness with artificial teeth and all the charm and composure of a child molester, Marcus is actually a criminal mastermind planning a robbery upon a London armored car. Marcus and his four partners in crime plan and execute the robbery using the rented quarters in Mrs. Wilburforce's house as a base of operations, concealing their covert discussions under the awkward guise of, of all things, pretending to be a string quartet.

While the string-quartet shtick of non-musicians is a five-star stroke of genius, the core humor in the story is generated in the funny tension between the unsuspecting and long-winded Mrs. Wilburforce, and the small, eccentric gang of bumbling criminals who would like very much to get on with their work without her annoying interruptions. When their crime is discovered, the gang are subdued not by force but by the shame and guilt rained down upon them with deadly avuncularity by the good Mrs. Wilburforce and her coffee klatch of elderly spinsters.

Ealing studios is legendary for it's stylish black and white comedies from the 1950's, but Ladykillers represented a departure from this norm, as it was shot in three strip Technicolor. This was a rather special and cumbersome technology that required a huge camera running three strips of film through it at the same time, but the color fidelity and resolution of I.B. Technicolor is nearly unimpeachable. Not only does having a discrete red, green and blue film record make Technicolor ideal for archival purposes, but the fact that the grain is distributed between three color separations should, in theory, make the quality superior to even the most modern color films. Certainly the idea of taking RGB emulsions direct to digital should yield amazing color fidelity.

On the other hand, each film layer also has the potential to pick up dust and damage. But the Ladykillers was very fortunate in it's time to have been shot on the new safety film, which also had superior archival properties. Thus, Ladykillers represented for Studio Canal an almost ideal candidate for digital restoral. The Blu-ray includes an eye-popping special feature which vividly illustrates in A/B split screen style before and after images of the restoration.

But I digress. Let me simply say that the Blu-Ray of Ladykillers is phenomenal on the digital screen -- assuredly a far superior visual experience to the version originally released in theaters. The colors are so rich yet subtle, and the London and Ealing studio locations so charming, Ladykillers is almost like a Mary Poppins story gone wrong, as if Walt Disney took a wrong turn on his Fantasyland train tracks.

The jaw-dropping (in this case, literally jaw-dropping) range of characters that Alec Guinness was able to conjure onto the screen over his varied career is nothing short of astonishing, and in Professor Marcus, Guinness created yet another totally unique gothic character. At one point, as Marcus is about to explode with destructive anger, Guinness even takes on a Hitchcockian profile -- but his rage is checked just in time by Mrs. Wilburforce. After all, it would be improper to act uncivilized in front of a lady.

Rounding out the wonderful cast of miscreants are the demure and proper Cecil Parker, Peter Sellers in one of his earliest roles (compared to Sellers' later work, very tame), Herbert Lom as an aggressive gangster-type, and the massive Danny Green as the small-brained ""One-Round"", the ""muscle"" of the outfit.

The string quartet motif drives much of the score, with a wealth of appropriately heavy-handed, sinister background music further supplied by the most able Tristram Cary, interwoven with train sound effects which penetrate the old house incessantly, also cued by the composer at exactly the right moments to insinuate danger or to help with the next scene transition.

I suppose one could even suggest that the multiple train tracks in the rail yard are a metaphor for the 3 strips of technicolor film running through the camera. Train tracks have long been recognized as an allegory for movie film. And in the end, our five, pathetic villains drop themselves onto the technicolor train tracks and thus are immortalized for posterity on the emulsion itself.

On a technical note, this film has much less foley and effects than we would accept as normal today, with sound effects coverage rather thin at times on the outdoor locations, where of course dialogue would be dubbed heavily. Where there were sound effects, they were often heavy and grating. Such are the contraints of optical film sound. Driving in cars in the streets of London, in the interiors of vehicles for example, there was no discernible automobile engine sound -- or much of anything else -- at times.

The house interior set is brilliantly crooked by design, the lighting and camera movement are very controlled, often exaggerating the contrasts between light and dark, and I give tremendous credit to cinematographer Otto Heller for his many dolly shots and other unusual set ups with such a massive camera. The surrealness of the imagery and characterizations give the film an hallucinatory, experimental, yet meticulous quality, which reminds one of Kubrick's best work.

But more than anything else, The Ladykillers is a study in how gothic comedy -- which normally is best executed in Black and White -- can be rendered in color with great success. It represents an important milestone in the transition between B&W and Color cinematography. I highly recommend the special features on this Blu-ray as well, especially the accompanying commentary by Philip Kemp.

Tragically, it seems this was Ealing's last great film, as the studio was thereafter purchased by the BBC, and was soon producing television shows.

While it does have it's imperfect moments, Ladykillers is destined to become a cult classic, if it isn't already, and will far outlast it's modern reincarnation.",1316390400,11,6623,5.143122676579925

This drle 1955 black comedy is from the Ealing Studio. The heist is carried out despite the old lady's constant, well-intentioned, and funny interruptions, she gradually realizes her part in it, and justice prevails with lots of giggles. Guiness, sporting a large overbite and flyaway hair, is charmingly devious as the gang leader, but it is the inimitable Katie Johnson who steals the show.

Alec Guinness, in a performance which suggests the mastery of German expressionism or Alistair Sim at his most dyspeptic,leads an ensemble of British character actors, including an admirably resrained pre-stardom Peter Sellers.

Given what they had to work with (a very corroded print covered in stuck-on hairs, fingerprints, scratch lines, blemishes in the negative, double-imaging of colour) - the result is little short of miraculous. It isn't picture-perfect for sure and some scenes still have corrosion and blocking in them, but mostly it's a massive improvement. Finally the BLU RAY format has brought out all that detailed restoration work - and it's the very best I've ever seen this beloved British classic look. The extras are superlative too - generous and hugely informative.

The first time you 'really' see the improvement is when Mrs. Wilberforce hands in a basket at the local cop shop run by Jack Warner who placates her with wonderful gentility. And more too when the shadow of Alec Guinness addles up to her front door with 'danger' strings sounding - she opens it - and there he is - all sinister grin and grubby scarf. The colour is superb and hugely improved.

And then of course there's cast you couldn't buy now for love or money - each one a gem - the Classical String Quartet of thieves - Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom, Cecil Parker and the big lug Danny Green - each one absolutely necessary to the overall state of anarchy. There's even Frankie Howerd (of Carry On fame) as the barrow boy.

But it's the perpetually making-tea old biddy played so brilliantly by Katie Johnson who steels the show.  Like some perverse and malicious force of nature, Mrs. Wilberforce sweetly wanders through the entire film causing all sorts of mayhem and death and is blissfully unaware of it all. You find yourself chuckling uncontrollably all through the film and for days afterwards. Half the enjoyment of course is watching all of the boys thinking they're smarter than her and then after-a-while falling for her genuine British goodness - only to find that she kills them all (unintentionally of course)! The film also belongs just as much to Alec Guinness (who stepped in for Alistair Sims) the mastermind of the heist. He is just delicious - creepily brilliant as he slinks around Mrs. 'Lopsided' and her King's Cross St. Pancreas home. With a genuinely evil relish, he's all the time probing the unwitting old lady for holes he can use (dialogue above). Unbelievably good and it hasn't dated a jot either.

Did you know that Peter Sellers also does the voices of all the Parrots, or that Alec Guinness only found his Professor Marcus character through a set of protruding teeth and that because Katie Johnson was 79 when she took the part, Ealing were afraid that the role might actually kill the poor woman, so she had to be insured or she couldn't do the part (she stumped up the money herself). Well you do now - and you'll learn a whole lot more besides about this 1955 gem through this wonderful release.

When Mrs. Wilberforce asks in the local shop at the beginning of the movie ""Has there been anything about the advertisement?"" - I urge you to answer the call.

Treat yourself to ""The Ladykillers"" on BLU RAY - and then sit there with a big mug of tea and a digestive - tittering uncontrollably every few minutes at its sheer genius.

It was interestingly pointed out to me that Alex's character Professor Marcus has a strikingly similar appearance of Alistair Sim. At first, you are caught up in the story and miss the entire inside jokes. Therefore, after watching the movie the first time be sure to look at the Blu-ray DVD extras and voiceovers that are supplied with the Blu-Ray version. Then watch the movie again and you will see all the marvelous things that they created that we missed that changes this movie from a three-star cute movie to an excellent production.

Some awfully strange and shifty characters rent a couple of rooms from what appears to be a ditzy old lady (Katie Johnson.)  They pretend to be musicians each carrying their own instrument but when the chips are down the estimate that actually plays is the Victrola. Why are they there? We soon find out that they plan the perfect robbery and intend to include the innocent ditzy old lady as their patsy.

Of course, everything goes swimmingly well. Well maybe not that well as the robbery does not go as smoothly as planned and you think that some of the robbers will get apoplexy watching how close the money comes to being repossessed. Soon they realize that the ditzy old lady is not so ditzy and suspects their motives. Hence the title of the movie that could have been a play, ""The Lady Killers.""

595936,5,6303209955,This is just a short remark about one of the great British classic films. Note that the Blu-ray release is processed in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The regular DVD release is processed to the anamorphic 1.78:1 (from 1.66:1) aspect ratio which was the original release intent [...]. I like the details and color on the Blu-ray DVD but the regular DVD is better suited for wide screen TVs. The 1.66:1 ratio is a matted format so that you do lose a slight bit of the frame on the top and bottom as compared to 1.33:1. However the 1.66:1 ratio was that which the cinematographer and director had in mind when this Ealing classic was filmed. There are many extras on the disc.,1266537600,9,668,4.483606557377049
595937,2,6303209955,There are no English subtitles. This is really a disgrace. Those that think English speakers do not need them should have their heads looked at. There are millions of people who are hard of hearing and hundreds of millions to whom English is a second language who NEED subtitles to follow the dialogue. To spend money and add Norwegian subtitles (when most Norwegians speak better English than most of those who use it as a main language) and NOT provide English subtitles is just disgraceful. A great comedy but to go to all this trouble and expense and then deny enjoyment to tens of millions of semi English speaking viewers is commercially stupid!,1266278400,13,651,4.769911504424779
595938,3,6303209955,"Sir Alec Guinness.  Young Peter Sellers.  An Oscar-nominated screenplay by William Rose.  An old British woman who foils them all.  With all of these factors racing towards the finish line, one could imagine the hilarity that was to follow.  Alas, after the first twenty minutes, it seemed to all come to a screeching halt.  Yes, there were comic moments, genius creativity, and excitement in the air, but as a whole, ""The Ladykillers"" was more a hodgepodge of could-be-great ideas mixed together with poor execution and a misuse of the actors' ability on-screen than a laugh-out-loud comedy.  Yes, this was a ""dark"" comedy, and the ending solidifies that idea, but what was lacking within the story was the actual comedy itself.  With such actors like Guinness, or Peter Sellers, or Danny Green; director Alexander MacKendrick had loads of opportunity to transform this film into a cult classic, to unleash the potential hidden within his players.  Too bad he missed the opportunity.  With a intriguing story, a fun old lady, and a misused cast, ""The Ladykillers"" may have been bold for the time, but today it just felt stale, slow, and misplaced.  How could a film with so much potential fall so flat?

Our story begins promising; with a little old lady (Ms. Lopsided) talking to the police about how there weren't aliens in her friend's garden.  As she travels home a looming figure follows her.  MacKendrick does a great job of creating early tension, this unknown of who is going to arrive at the door or what the motives may be.  As Guinness rings the bell, the shadow is revealed to have large fake teeth and a comb-over.  This random act of costume design demonstrates the ability of comedy on both the part of the actor and the director.  As Guinness swoops into his charming devilish self, the dynamic between him and the old lady becomes the crux of this film.  MacKendrick must realize that the two have chemistry (or that the two were the obvious focus of the film) because he focuses his entire remainder of the film on these two alone, oddly leaving everyone else in the wake of unknown.  As we are introduced to the rest of the string quartet, as audience members, we have hope that these actors will provide us with genuine laughs.  Perhaps some comedic parody or defined character humor, but there is none.  Sellers is left with a cardboard character worthy of mere facial expressions and overblown acting.  He is wasted because MacKendrick is too focused on Guinness.  The same can be said for everyone else in the background the focuses more on clich&eacute; than on actual substantial characters.  Major Courtney, One Round, Harry, and Louis are lost within the scene, leaving the audience to care nothing for them, giving us a less-involved ending.

With our major actors in no position to lead, we are left with a story that remains the excitement of this film.  The heist scene alone is worth watching this movie for 90ish minutes.  To have early scenes (and scenes after) carry the same theme song throughout, but then have no music at all during the heist - only enhanced the experience.  Again, MacKendrick had to have known that he had a great script, I just wish he could have managed his actors a bit more.  The choreography for the heist, as well as the cinematography, was pure caper.  It was executed as well as any Michael Mann film could have dreamed.  Everything from the actual robbery all the way until Mrs. Lopsided's role in the scheme was introduced was finely tuned.  Even the escape, which kept me on my toes, seemed well developed and enjoyable - but then again, we seemed to come to another hodgepodge thematic and tone downfall.  The introduction of the other old ladies was fun, but after that - when the group begins to implode, it just doesn't feel right.  I was ready for the dark comedy, but there are always two parts to this - both the darkness and the comedy - and ""The Ladykillers"" was lacking in the latter.

So, the mix of bad characters with substantial plot really made this should-have-been great film into just another decent 50s British film.  If MacKendrick would have focused a bit more on the actors' abilities than I think he would have had a solid film, but without it - it just felt disjoined, poorly edited, and a splattering of good points with bad.  Overall, just a mediocre film.

VIDEO:  Anchor Bay's release of this film (which is not out of print) was pretty well developed.  There wasn't much in the way of special features, but the presentation was there.  The sound, sight, and detail were captured well on DVD - I just wish the overall film would have felt the same way.

VISUAL:  The colors made this film worth watching.  The British in the 50s made very colorful film, and despite this being a dark comedy, the colors do play a substantial role.  This DVD transfer demonstrates that by giving us darks and brightness when needed.  Albeit that sometimes it does get too dark, but it heightens the experience.

SOUND:  Another great transfer for this film.  The trains sounded as crisp as the music that was being played in Mrs. Lopsided's home.  The inclusion of the music in some scenes and not the others made for intense viewing and a sense of familiarity.

EXTRAS:  Your typical cast bios done via sheet method, some trailers and that is about it.  There is a Blu version coming soon that I hope packs a bit more in it - perhaps some history on this film would help raise the score.

Overall, I just wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be.  It began with quite a bit of excitement and creativity, but by the end I just wanted it to be over.  I wanted to get to know the other characters more; I wanted to see them evolve like I did the story.  I had high hopes for Sellers, whom is merely a background character - demonstrating none of his ability.  Guinness does shine, but he cannot carry this entire film.  The old lady made me laugh, and while the reimagine is no better, I can see why the Cohen's wanted to remake their version.  That final scene with the old lady was phenomenal, but why couldn't the rest of the film follow suit.  Decent - but nothing worth keeping or watching again or again.

I won't try to summarize the movie, that's been done enough already...but...Guiness rents a flat from a very nice, little old lady and tells her that he and his musician friends will be practicing a lot.  In fact they are planning their grand heist.

The little old lady, who is ever so helpful, is constantly butting in to the increasing unhappiness of the gang. Ultimately, our boys decide that they will need to 'rub the old lady out'.  Unfortunately, none of them really wants to be the hit man.  Nevertheless, a killer is chosen but fails miserably and is ultimately killed himself.  Guiness as gang leader grows increasingly neurotic with unbelievable facial ticks.  Another killer is chosen but himself dies, leaving the old lady untouched.  You've got it. The gang wipes itself out.  You see, crime really doesn't pay.

By the way, this film is significantly better than the more recent film starring Tom Hanks of the same name.

595978,4,6303209955,"It's pretty well known in certain circles, like the ones I grew up in some time ago, that the British movie studio known as Ealing created a series of wonderful comedies in the 1950s.(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ealing-Studios-Comedy-Collection-The-Maggie-A-Run-for-Your-Money-Titfield-Thunderbolt-Whisky-Galore-Passport-to-Pimlico/dp/B0007LPSFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ealing Studios Comedy Collection (The Maggie / A Run for Your Money / Titfield Thunderbolt / Whisky Galore! / Passport to Pimlico)</a>&nbsp;for starters.) I can still remember the thrill of anticipation I had, as I scrunched down in my seat in the movie house, and the J. Arthur Rank living logo, that bare-chested, muscular, well-oiled man, who hit the great big dinner gong, came on the screen.  And ""The Ladykillers""(1955), quite a black comedy, has long been considered one of the best of the lot.  It was made in Technicolor, the only one of the dozen comedies to be made in color.  And, like many of the others, it was produced by Michael Balcom, directed by Alexander Mackendrick, and starred the young Alec Guinness.  And the script that has stood up surprisingly well all these years was by William Rose.  (The recent, 2004 remake by the Coen brothers --<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ladykillers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00029LNYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ladykillers (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;--was far less sophisticated.)

The actor has said he based his characterization on Alastair Sim,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol/dp/B000SR0DDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol </a>) the popular, frequently-seen, Scottish-born character actor; and that he created it from a set of false teeth he wore, that gave him an extraordinary overbite.  However Guinness got there, he certainly does remind this viewer of Sim.  Anyway, Marcus is putting together a daring daylight train robbery in the heart of London, and has decided to plan it in rented rooms in the home of the 87-year old Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson), and, further, to use Mrs. Wilberforce as an unwitting accomplice.  He and his posse are meeting in the annoyingly officious Mrs. Wilberforce's house, pretending to be amateur musicians practicing a Boccherini quintet. His posse is certainly made up of first-rate comedic actors.

(Once upon a time, when this film was made, the English called men who aggressively sold goods from barrows Barrow Boys, and it wasn't particularly complimentary.  Now, they call men who aggressively sell stocks in the City, and have made fortunes, Barrow Boys, and the implications are a lot more complimentary.)

As with almost all English films, particularly of this vintage, the action's slow; surely slow to American audiences.  And not all the comedy bits have held up in the nearly 55 years since the film was made.  There are also several puzzling lapses in continuity: one of Marcus's men smashes their Boccherini record, but it goes right on playing: at one point, it's playing while all the men, the supposed musicians, are out of the room.  One of Mrs. Wilberforce's pet parrots, supposed to have been her late seaman husband's, apparently really had nautical experience: at one point, he's giving out an S.O.S. - and at another, he says ""Alec Guinness.""

Katie Johnson, who plays Mrs. Wilberforce, actually was quite elderly.  Initially the film makers, who considered Mackendrick to be a demanding director, planned to give the part to a younger actress, but at the death of the younger woman, Johnson was cast.  Her Mrs. Wilberforce at one point delivers a ""Casablanca"" homage: she is ""shocked, shocked,"" she says, at what the men have planned in her house.  She really is the unsung heroine of the movie; the heart of it, who holds it together, appearing in most scenes. You'd have to say the lack of respect given her, in the movie, and in real life, billing matters, etc., reflects the sexism and ageism of the time in filmmakers and actors.  Furthermore, her heart's in the right place: she rubs up against Howerd's Barrow Boy in an attempt to stop his mistreatment of a horse. Right on, Mrs. Wilberforce; and you get yourself those dozen new umbrellas that you've been musing about your new-found ability to buy with the ""lolly.""",1218844800,,5836,6.517464424320828

Reading through a lengthy series (49 as I write this) of Amazon reviews is often rewarding.  In this case the great majority of those who write of this film lavish praise on the cast and plot.  A substantial sub-class of reviewers felt it necessary to denounce the recent remake with Tom Hanks.  (And quite right they were, too!)  One reviewer praised the film and then gave a miserly single star in what must have been sheer error.

A single reviewer despised the film for its slow pace.  In a brisk 91 minutes ""The Ladykillers"" offers the planning of a heist, its execution and the crumbling of all criminal expectations, along with the increasingly ironic deaths of five crooks.  As Basil Fawlty might ask, what more does the reviewer want--herds of wildebeest rushing across the plains while Krakatoa explodes in the background?

A few reviewers noted that Alec Guinness was doing a masterly imitation of the great Alistair Sim.  On that point, I have always wondered why Ealing didn't just cast Sim in the role in the first place.  Sim starred in a deliciously black little comedy called ""The Green Man"" in which he played a master assassin foiled by a witless door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman.  ""The Green Man"" misses the exalted status of the films listed at the beginning of this piece by the narrowest of margins.  Sim was also in ""The School for Scoundrels,"" of course, but that small gem is just a little too cheery for true black comedy.

There are excellent summaries of the plot and insightful commentaries on the actors.  I feel no need to repeat either here.  I shall, then, take up three points that no-one has mentioned.

Billing in this film is odd.  Guinness is clearly intended to be the star.  The four other members of the gang are prominently listed.  But 75 year-old Katie Johnson, who actually turned out to be the star of the picture and earned the British equivalent of an Oscar to prove it--not to mention the plain fact that she ate Guinness alive in every scene they shared--is listed as one of the supporting players in seventh or eighth spot.

The set design is stupendous.  Mrs. Wilberforce's tiny, lopsided house on top of the railway bridge, idiosyncratic plumbing and all, is one of the greatest locations ever put on film.  That house becomes as much a character in the movie as Mrs. W, herself, or any of the gang.

The musical score is quite perfect for the film--as good in its small way as the score of ""Alexander Nevsky.""  It begins in unexpected formality with an Elgar-like symphonic introduction.  Soon Mrs. Wilberforce appears and she comes with her own theme, almost a leitmotiv: ""The Last Rose of Summer"" played on a barrel organ.  The heist has its theme, too, the Boccherini String Quintet (deedle-deedle-dee-dum-ti-dee-dee).  Once heard, it is never to be forgotten.  When all is well with the heist, so it is with the Quintet (deedle-deedle-dee-dum-ti-dee-dee).  When difficulties arise, the Quintet suffers.  At one point, a recording of the Boccherini is removed from a phonograph and intentionally smashed.  As the movie swirls toward ultimate darkness, Boccherini disappears and the score generates a new theme: bodies plunging over the railroad bridge (harummm-THUD).  Again, once heard, never forgotten.  At the end of the film, a new and better day for Mrs. W is hailed by the reappearance of the barrel organ and ""The Last Rose of Summer.""

""The Ladykillers,"" admittedly makes demands on its viewers that are seldom to be found in contemporary pictures.  It requires, for example, an attention span greater than that of a gnat.

596036,4,6303209955,"Ealing Studios made a series of outrageous caper comedies usually starring Alec Guiness and usually brilliant.  The Ladykillers is a great film but not the best of the collection.

This is a heist film that goes wrong after the heist.  Professor Marcus (Guiness) needs two things - a place to plan his crime and the perfect patsy to pick up the loot.  He finds both in Mrs. Wilberforce, a little old lady who has a house near the train station.  He rents a room from her and tells her that he has a small classical chamber group that will be practicing in his room.

Marcus holds ""rehearsals"" with his fellow musicans including the con man (Cecil Parker), the muscle man (Danny Green), the gangster (Herbert Lom) and the awkward newcomer (Peter Sellers in his feature role debut.)  But the perfect hostess Mrs. Wilberforce continues to interrupt them by offering them tea and coffee.

The heist is the robbery of the Bank of England transit of bank notes at the local train station.  The heist goes off perfectly.  Marcus gets Mrs. Wilberforce to pick up a chest from the train station.  What she doesn't know is that it contains the loot.  Things begin to unravel when Mrs. Wilberforce decides to stop and come to the rescue of a horse.  The junkyard horse is eating the fruit off the cart and the fruit seller (Frankie Howerd) is trying to stop the horse from eating his stock.

This erupts into an all-out brawl that the constable has to stop, landing everyone and the loot at police station.  But don't worry, Mrs. Wilberforce is friends with the police and the deliver her and the chest back to her home.

Now you may think the film is almost over but this is British comedy.  It has just begun.

The crooks move their loot from the trunk to the cello case.  They are just inches from the escape when the cello case opens and Mrs. Wilberforce finds out what really happens.  The gang decides that she must be dealt with.  One by one they try to kill her but wind up with their own demise.

Guiness gives a great performances again but is upstaged by Katie Johnson as Mrs. Wilberforce.

596094,5,6303209955,"It must have been great fun to make this film.  In watching it I can certainly see how Hanks must've thought it'd be great fun to do it himself, although by all accounts the remake is a flop I've not seen it and, having now seen the original, I don't care to; this one is just perfect as it is.

Alec Guinness stars as a criminal mastermind with a questionable mental state and some of the worst teeth you've ever seen.  He plays the slimy Professor in all his retentive glory.  Peter Sellers & Herbert Lom, well known as Inspector Clouseau & Chief Inspector Dreyfuss of the Pink Panther films, are excellent here too, Sellers as a pre-60s ""mod"" young man in one of his first featured roles and Lom as a paranoid murderer.  The gang is rounded out with a couple of lesser known actors who are absolutely brilliant as One Round, the dim-witted muscle man with a heart of gold and the sophisticated Major.

But the lady at the heart of it all trumps the whole cast.  Sweet little Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson) was a scene-stealer of the first degree in this film, and I've not seen here in anything else but would love to.  She's the kind of little old lady you want to spend time with just because she's so deeply sweet you hope it rubs off on you...but she's no gullible caricature, and she sets things to right and has a happy ending.

And it's all absolutely hilarious and brilliant, watching this gang's perfect robbery derailed by the humanity of those involved.  A charming, riotously funny movie that's worth watching repeatedly.  It just doesn't get much better than ""The Ladykillers.""",1135900800,7,1595,4.56140350877193
596095,5,6303209955,"The original classic that the Tom Hanks film is based on.  Miss Wilberforce is a force to be reckoned with, or at least avoided.  This is apparent in the opening scene when her mere presence sends an infant into hysterics.  Her busybody attitude at the police station gives the viewer an idea of what to expect of her.  But while the viewer suspect, The Professor (Alec Guinness) is not privy to that information.

Guinness is the mastermind behind a robbery and he has signed up as a lodger at the Wilberforce home.  There he meets with his partners while posing as musicians.  But while the caper is pulled off the real trials begin.  The thieves must deal with each other and the ever-present and meddlesome Wilberforce as mistrust builds rapidly and secrets get harder to hide.  Tempers flare and more crimes need to be committed to keep the theft secret until the final conclusion.

This is black comedy at its best.  Miss Wilberforce is an almost delight as she seems to move unscathed and uninformed through the machinations of the thieves.  Her actions in the opening and closing scene are priceless classics and no remake could recapture the feeling.  A must see for any fan of Alec Guinness or of black comedy in general.

596097,5,6303209955,"Now that's an ominous movie line if I ever heard one, spoken by Professor Marcus, with regards to his plans to commit the perfect crime.  The only thing he didn't figure on was the disastrous affects that one, kindly old lady named Mrs. Louisa Wilberforce would have on said plans.  The Ladykillers (1955), written by William Rose (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner) and directed by Alexander Mackendrick (The Man in the White Suit), stars Sir Alec Guinness (The Bridge on the River Kwai, Murder by Death), Herbert Lom (A Shot in the Dark, The Return of the Pink Panther), and Katie Johnson (How to Murder a Rich Uncle).  Also appearing is Cecil Parker (The Man Who Changed His Mind), Danny Green (The 7th Voyage of Sinbad), Jack Warner (The Quatermass Xperiment), and Peter Sellers (The Mouse That Roared, The Pink Panther) in his first, major screen role.

The story begins innocently enough, as we meet Mrs. Wilberforce (Johnson), a dear, elderly widowed woman who lives in a small English town, in a small, slanted house (the `subsidence' occurred due to the bombing of a previous war, you see, and so one effect is none of the pictures in the house hang correctly) with her three birds.  Interested in taking on a border (perhaps as much for company as well as the extra income), she posts an ad, one that's answered by Professor Marcus (Guinness), an odd-looking fellow with more in mind than just renting a room.  Turns out Professor Marcus is a criminal mastermind, and he and his gang, featuring Louis (Lom), Harry (Sellers), Claude (Parker), and One-Round (Green) are preparing to steal a great deal of money, and are not only using Mrs. Wilberforce's home as a headquarters and hideout, but Marcus' diabolical scheme also involves using her as an unwitting sixth member.  The score goes off relatively hitch free, but little do they know the amount of trouble about to be brought down upon their collective heads as this kindly, old lady continuously, albeit inadvertently, mucks up their cunning designs, eventually becoming wise, forcing the men to take desperate measures in now they must eliminate this sweet, old woman, or surely be caught.  Five harden criminals against a lone, elderly woman?  They don't stand a chance...

Of all the Ealing Studios/Alec Guinness dark comedies I've seen, The Ladykillers is probably my favorite, although I have yet to see Kind Hearts and Coronets (1950), which I've heard is also excellent.  The comedic caricatures presented here are truly wonderful, in the hardened career criminal Louis (Lom), the seemingly sophisticated prim and proper Claude (Parker), whose classy veneer hides a cowardly core, the slick and excitable Harry (Sellers), the loutish, dimwitted One-Round (Green), who's the muscle of the group, and finally the ever cunning, devious, slimy bucktoothed (he wore specially made false teeth for the role), yet slyly witty, Professor Marcus, played by Guinness.  The supporting cast provides much, but the real star is Guinness.  His ability to assume the role of his characters is among the best I've ever seen.  From the way he talks, walks, his mannerism, facial expressions, and even they way he sits all are intended to work together to achieve the desired result.  And he does this with such seeming ease, garnering the accolade, rightly so, of being the acting equivalent of a chameleon.  He does have his hands full in that of Katie Johnson, as she threatens to steal nearly every scene she's in as the sweet, seemingly frail Mrs. Wilberforce.  She's the small, unassuming, gracious, genial elderly woman with the kindest heart, sweetest disposition (that is unless she thinks you're hurting an animal), and friendliest manner I've ever seen.  You'd think all of this would come off as phony, but it truly seems like it's part of her nature, like she's someone plucked off the street, placed amongst these characters and is not acting, but being herself amidst these actors, or at least that was the impression I got...she also had some of my favorite scenes.  The gang posed as a stringed quartet as to cover their reason for being in her home, and so while they met to make with their plans, they would put on a record playing some classical piece, to which she would often comment quite verbosely  on later, usually to One-Round for his exceptional cello playing, to which One-Round would have absolutely no idea what she was talking about, and just nod with a idiotic look on his face.  Another favorite scene is when she finally discovers what the gang has been up to, and proceeds to admonish them in her own way, calling their behavior shocking and appalling, much like a parent would register his or her disappointment in a child.  And the men, these dangerous criminal types, stand there, taking it, with hangdog expressions.  There's a great many funny scenes, both of the low brow and the sophisticated kind.  This is a fine example of so many elements, the writing, direction, script, music, etc., working in tune with each other to create one of the funniest comedies I'll probably ever see.  There has been a remake, released in 2004, made by the Coen Brothers, starring Tom Hanks, which I haven't seen, but given how much I like this original version, I can't say I'm eager to watch the newer version as I doubt, even despite Mr. Hanks and the Coens talents, that they could come close to matching the level of entertainment provided here.

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a beautiful widescreen picture (1.66:1), enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs, on this DVD, and the monaural Dolby Digital 1.0 is decent (I could have used some subtitles, as the English accents made some of the dialogue hard to understand, but this was an infrequent event, and didn't spoil the film whatsoever).  Special features include a theatrical trailer for the film, along with an extensive biography of Alec Guinness, and also a reproduction of a poster for the film, printed on a heavy cardboard insert (chapter stops on the back).  If I learned anything from this film, it's the invaluable nature of having direct access to a train yard when the need arises to dispose of a body...

596099,5,6303209955,"In THE LADYKILLERS Alec Guiness stars as the criminal mastermind, Professor Marcus, behind a perfect plot to pull of a great train robbery (well, all the money from a train). Marcus has orchestrated the perfect plot as well as the perfect crew to pull off the heist:  Major Claude Courtney (Cecil Parker), Louis Harvey (Herbert Lom), Harry Robinson (Peter Sellers), and One-Round Lawson (Danny Green). The gang is altogether, but they need a place to meet to plan the last minute details. Enter Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson). Mrs. Wilberforce rents out a room in her house to Professor Marcus believing he and his gang are actually an instrumental ensemble. They fool the elderly woman by playing the same record over and over and over as they hash out the plot of their crime. They pull of the crime perfectly, but an accident during the getaway brings Mrs. Wilberforce into the circle of crime. When she refuses to go along with the plan, the gang draws straws to decide who will bump her off. But five criminals are no match for the honesty and humility of a strong-willed little woman.

Writer William Rose is said to have dreamed up the entire movie literally in a dream in his sleep one night. I can believe that because the film flows together seamlessly, as though born out of an ethereal universe and tinged with the dark comedy of nightmare.

Guinness was at the beginning of the peak of his career (BRIDGE OVER RIVER KWAI was just two years away) and gives a delightful show. His performance as the slimy Professor Marcus is dead-on. The other performances are just as brilliant and it's a special treat to see Guinness and Sellers together in the same dark comedy.  However, the true star of the movie is Katie Johnson. Johnson's Mrs. Wilberforce is the true driving charcter in the story and it takes an extremely talented actress to upstage the likes of actors such as Guinness and Sellers. Surprisingly the producers originally rejected director Alexander Mackendrick's choice of Johnson as Mrs. Wilberforce because they felt the woman was to frail to handle the rigours of the filmming schedule. They hired a younger actress instead, but several weeks before filmming she died.  It must have been an omen.

Alec Guinness plays Professor Marcus, the brainy leader of a gang of disparate thieves planning an armored car hold-up. To that end, Marcus takes up residence as a lodger in the home of aged widow Louisa Wilberforce (Katie Johnson), whose old, sagging house is at the bottom of a cul-de-sac street, and whose backyard is directly above the entrance to a railway tunnel.  The Professor and his cronies, Claude (Cecil Parker), Louis (Herbert Lom), Harry (Peter Sellers), and One-Round (Danny Green), plan their heist in one of Louisa's upstairs rooms while masquerading as a string quartet practicing their repertoire. The elegant music Mrs. Wilberforce hears actually comes from a phonograph player. And, the genteel landlady is to be an unsuspecting accomplice in the crime.

I'm used to the dignified characters played by Sir Alec during his distinguished film career: Colonel Nicholson in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, George Smiley (perhaps his greatest role) in TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE, and Prince Faisal in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. Thus, his Marcus persona here is almost a shock, albeit an eminently watchable one. The under-eye shadow, prosthetic teeth, moistly protruding red lips, and almost-lispy voice make the Professor more reminiscent of Dracula's gofer Renfield than anyone else. It's difficult to believe this is the same Guinness that played the starched and honorable Colonel Nicholson on the Kwai but two years later.

Katie Johnson is perfectly understated as the frail, absent-minded, grandmotherly Wilberforce, who, even with that round, absurdly-flowered hat perched primly on the crown of her head, can dominate Marcus and his cronies to their ultimate distraction.

Visually, THE LADYKILLERS has some especially good moments for train buffs who, in this age of modern diesel/electrics, may pine for the old steam engines. Filmed on location, presumably in London, at the junction of several rail lines, there are panoramic shots of steam-belching locomotives crossing a lofty railroad viaduct, as well as disappearing into that aforementioned tunnel. Indeed, the trains passing by are the vehicles for the film's more darkly humorous moments.

As a dark comedy, I suppose THE LADYKILLERS would qualify as a mid-fifties ""classic"" of the genre. But, is it funny? Well, perhaps mildly droll at best. (Just as some of the edgier comedies of today will seem quaintly amusing five decades hence.)

This film is one of those great dark comedies,that could only ever be made in Britain. An American version would fail outright. Alec Guiness is in top form as a clever conman,and his gang of off beat cronies. Alec Guiness takes up residence at the home of the kindly Mrs. Wilberforce,convincing her he's a director of a string quartet. ( a.k.a.his gang.).That's the basic premise.

596179,5,6303209955,"I recently purchased The Horse's Mouth (1958) from Amazon as well as ""The Alec Guinness Collection"" which includes The Ladykillers (1955) plus four others: The Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), and The Captain's Paradise (1953). Frankly, I was amazed how well each of the six films has held up since I first saw it.
For me, the most memorable performance in this film is provided by Katie Johnson as Mrs. Louisa Alexandra Wilberforce who rents a flat to Professor Marcus (Guinness) and his companions. The plot such as it is involves their theft of 60,000 pounds and subsequent efforts to remove it from a locker they have rented to store it temporarily. For about half of this film, brilliantly directed by Alexander Mackendrick (who also directed Guinness in The Man in the White Suit, 1951), Mrs. Wilberforce believes that Marcus and his friends are honest citizens and amateur musicians. When she learns that they are thieves, her first concern is not for her personal safety (which is never in doubt, anyway) but to return ""the lolly"" to its rightful owners. Complications include her elderly friends who appreciatively swarm around the Marcus group during a hilarious afternoon tea party. One development of special interest to me is the fact that, except for the psychopath Louis Harvey (Lom), the thieves do not want Mrs. Wilberforce harmed in any way and begin to feel protective toward her. This proves to be significant as the plot proceeds gracefully to a conclusion I did not anticipate.
Given the number of deaths which occur in this film, it seems inappropriate to describe it as ""charming"" and ""delightful"" but it is nonetheless.  For that, I give most of the credit to the performance by Katie Johnson under Mackendrick's direction and with the strong support of Guinness who obviously defers to her prominence in so many important scenes. The supporting cast is first-rate. Yes, that really is a very young Peter Sellers in the role of Harry Robinson who is given relatively little to say and do. Danny Green is excellent as One Round, providing the muscle needed to complete the plan devised by the group's brain, Marcus.

However, I had picked up the film because it had both Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers and was therefore rather surprised that the one doing all the scene stealing is Katie Johnson as Mrs. Wilberforce, a sweet little old lady who makes it a daily practice to go round to the local constable's station each day to keep them apprised on what is happening in the neighborhood.  Guinness plays Professor Marcus, a criminal mastermind who plans on duping Mrs. Wilberforce into being an unwitting member of his gang, who are going to rob a armored car.  As a cover, he tells the old lady that they are a string quartet, and they play the same record over and over again while they develop their scheme.  When Mrs. Wilberforce repeatedly arrives to offer tea, coffee, or any other comfort that comes to mind, the criminals all stand around uncomfortably holding their instruments and try to make small talk.
The gang has all of your standard criminal types.  Danny Green is the gentle giant, One-Round (a.k.a. Mr. Lawson), Cecily Parker is the old army chap Claude (a.k.a. Major Courtney), Herbert Lom is the cold-hearted killer Louis (a.k.a. Mr. Harvey), and Sellers is the young rouge Harry (a.k.a. Mr. Robinson).  However, the ironic point of this 1955 black comedy is that together they are no match for Mrs. Wilberforce.  The heist goes off without a hitch, that is to say until Mrs. Wilberforce plays her unwitting role in the proceedings.  What follows is like the old Chinese finger torture, where the more things work for the gang the worst off they get as the little old lady thwarts their plans without even trying.  Eventually even Mrs. Wilberforce is able to add up things enough to become a liability.  Then the criminals make the biggest mistake of all: they draw lots to see who has to do the old lady in.  The idea that Guinness, Sellars, and the rest of the gang could be reduced to minor roles by a little old lady is astounding, but that is the precise irony that makes ""The Ladykillers"" a classic.",1054339200,59,2159,4.685185185185185
596181,5,6303209955,"My parents took me to see ""The Ladykillers"" when it first came out in England in 1955--I loved it then, and I have never changed my mind. It is my favourite Ealing comedy. I will try not to duplicate other comments, but I'm pleased to see that the other reviewers think as highly of this film as I do.
Of course Sir Alec--with those horrible teeth and hair--is marvellous, but this gem is very much an ensemble piece. The rest of the ""gang""--cocky young Peter Sellers--guilt-ridden Cecil Parker--dim, thuggish Danny Green--nasty, impatient Herbert Lom--are all terrific in support. As for Katie Johnson, she achieved some sort of cinematic immortality, as the sweet, little, old lady, who quite innocently undermines the gang, and its dream of enjoying the stolen ""lolly"". Also watch out for reliable Jack Warner playing--as always--a policeman, and a riotous cameo from a young Frankie Howerd.
The DVD is nice--the colour is pretty decent for a 48-year old film. Well done, Anchor Bay !
If you like British comedy from what many consider to be its ""golden age"", owning ""The Ladykillers"" is not a luxury--it is a necessity.
P.S. If anyone from Anchor Bay reads this, how about a nice DVD of ""Genevieve "" ?",1041897600,3,1205,4.826086956521739
596182,5,6303209955,"Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness) visits an old lady, Mrs. Wilberforce, in regards to renting a room from her.  The Professor also asks if he can invite some friends over to practice playing music, yet, it is obvious to the audience that the Professor has other intentions.  The men in the Professor's company plan on raiding a bank truck and Mrs. Wilberforce is essential in the plans.  However, something goes wrong and this event leads to a series of misfortunes for the gang.  The Ladykillers is a dark comedy that provides smiles and laughs in a witty and pleasant manner while keeping the audience pondering what will happen next.",1036281600,,635,4.851851851851852
596183,5,6303209955,"This is the kind of dark, bleak comedy that the British excelled at in the 1950s, and seems to anticipate many of the comic trends found on both sides of the Atlantic in the decades that were to follow.  The plot concerns the adventures of a group of thieves who meet in the apartment of Alec Guinness, the gang's mastermind and the tenant of the lady of the title.  Although the movie has many wonderful moments, I think my favorites are those in which a wildly grinning Guinness explains to his landlady the various goings on in his flat.
The cast is absolutely first rate.  Even by Guinness's chameleonic standards, this is one of his more unusual performances.  He made himself up to bear a striking resemblance to the great Alastair Sim, wearing some padding to make his frame look more like Sim's, and wearing false teeth and combing his hair to more successfully mimic Sim.  It is a quite successful imitation, but I would enjoy knowing a bit more about why Guinness made this decision.  Anyone familiar with the Pink Panther films will be delighted to see Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom as members of Guinness's gang.  Lom was one of the great heavies in 1950s British film, and his casting in a comedy film was at the time highly unusual.  Sellers, of course, was a few years from the film that would first bring him fame, I'm ALRIGHT, JACK, and his role in this film is not a major one.  This is very definitely the ""early"" Peter Seller, carrying a great deal more weight before he lost a great deal because of the illnesses that plagued him throughout most of his life (Sellers suffered from a very serious heart condition the eventually killed him).
This film isn't for everyone.  It isn't a film that will illicit laughs so much as smiles.  And many will find the entire tone to be very, very dark, perhaps too dark for their liking.  Finally, many will not enjoy a comedy in which all the major characters are essentially unlikable cads.  But for those of us for whom these are not barriers, this is one of the most unique and enjoyable comedies of the 1950s.",1033603200,11,2072,4.537634408602151
596184,5,6303209955,"This film is a blast to watch...Sir Alec gives another amazing performance. I watched it several times to be sure I didn't miss anything,and the one thing I noticed repeatedly is the fact that he ""reacts"" better than anyone in the business. Very subtly,to be sure,but perfect. The entire cast is a dream combination. If you are a fan of wry humor,and especially a fan of Guinness (and a very young Peter Sellers),and the rest of the cast...you will not be disappointed.",1032566400,3,469,4.7317073170731705
596185,5,6303209955,"What a wonderful accomplishment this piece of movie-making is (though you have to ignore the glaring inconsistencies...which is easy for it adds to the charm). It is apparent when watching that Alec Guinness is in convivial company and enjoying every minute of it. Katie Johnson (Mrs. Wilberforce...aka Mrs. Lop-sided) is hysterical as the duped go between for the 'lolly', but despite her protestations of guilt in this regard quite refuses to take responsibility for the 'East Castle Street Job'...""I don't even know East Castle Street is...!""
Ealing Studios where this and other fantastic classics where professionally thrown together, (that's a description that though inaccurate by far...fits), is now reopen after too many years and has just finished production of a new 'The importance of being Earnest', by Oscar Wilde of course, with Dame Judi Dench cast as Lady Bracknell...""a Handbagggg!??"". Couldn't be better than Edith Evans but the good news is not so much the film as the British Studio revived. As to The Ladykillers...buy this movie, you work hard and you deserve some nice treats...some simple luxuries.",1029715200,,1122,5.308988764044944
596186,5,6303209955,"This movie is for those who appreciate humour with a British Touch.  Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers and fellow robbers take a room with a little old lady, to use as a shield for the bank robbery.  But it has wild reprocussions as that little old lady ties them into knots.
An absolute howl, one of Guiness' best (showing his marvel range especially if you buy it with Damn the Defiant!)

7840903,5,6303209955,First off this is an excellent copy of this film. You will not be disappointed in the quality. This is one of my favorite films with Peter Sellers in one of his earliest roles teamed with Herbert Lin who would later do the Punk Panther movies with him. Alec Guinness is as always fabulous but for me Katie Johnson steals the show as the quintessential British Symbol of all that is right and good in the nation. Her character plays beautifully off of the gang of thieves. i love the little anachronisms like the perfectly repaired roof at the conclusion of the movie leaving you wondering along with the police wether or not any of the story really occurred. Great truly funny movie!,1515542400,,683,4.560975609756097
