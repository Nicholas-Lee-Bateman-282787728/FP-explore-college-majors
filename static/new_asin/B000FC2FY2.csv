I started watching last week, and now I don't want to stop. I love it! I'm 19 and I watch kids shows, because I'm awesome! If you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Zack and Cody Martin live with their mom at the Tipton hotel. Cody is the smart one. Zack is the one always making trouble. Mr. Moseby is the manager who must put up with their shenanagans. London is the dumb spoiled rich girl who is an heir to the hotel. Maddie is the hot blonde who works in the candy department who oftens helps with Zack, Cody, and London with their problems. I highly recommend THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY!!!",1235347200,,777,4.221476510067114

I couldn't find it in any store around here and was impresses that Amazon carried it. It contains a few 22 minute (no commercial) episodes from the Disney Channel. These are episodes your child has probably seen on TV but our daughter cries to watch them even when they are not on, so it was perfect for us.

2560625,2,B000FC2FY2,"..Cause this series is a terrible downer. The jokes are rarely funny and the show consists of shallowly-attractive celebrities who are rich somewhat spoiled and get their way nearly every time. None of them act that well, and London is the most spoiled, terrible actress that Disney has ever spat out at us. I totally despise her stupid, ditzy air-headed persona. It makes me sick, how stupid she has to act to get 10 year olds to laugh.

I didn't like the program when it first arrived on the Disney Channel over two and a half years ago, and I grew to loathe it, episode after episode after episode.

Watch Lizzy McGuire, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, or The Proud Family; they're much better, well-rounded Disney programs.

2560633,5,B000FC2FY2,"I usually avoid kids' shows like the plague; what with all of the fart jokes, bratty attitudes and non-existent plotlines.  My boys have grown up watching MythBusters, The Daily Show and Seinfeld (Spongebob is ok, but a little annoying after a couple of episodes).  When my 10 year old first put this show on, I thought, ""Great - another show I'll have to skip over.""  I heard both my 5 year old and older son laughing like crazy and stepped in to check it out.  To my surprise, it actually is entertaining.  The characters are well-developed, there is a common thread between all the shows (think Seinfeld's cafe scenes or Homer Simpson's interactions with Flanders), but each has its own plotline and interesting interplay between the characters.  It's a very comfortable show, easy to follow for even a kindergartener, but enjoyable by kids up to 12 or so (at which point they'll be come too cool to watch it).  The best part, though, is that parents can relate to the adult characters, especially the boys' mother.  I'll nearly always wander in and watch whenever my kids are, and we TiVo the episodes to watch instead of the other junk (most of Cartoon Network and Nick's shows) that is on.

We're looking forward to the episode set on DVD - the TiVo is filling up and we'll be able to make some room when we have these available on disc.  This is a great kids' show that is not schmaltzy, bratty or poorly written - it's a rare gem in the current TV wasteland.",1166745600,2,1466,4.5399239543726235
2560634,4,B000FC2FY2,"""Suite Life of Zack and Cody"" is a sitcom like the ones I grew up on (""Diff'rent Strokes"", ""The Facts of Life"", ""Growing Pains"").  However, I would say that--99% of the time--it is even more kid-friendly than those shows (when it comes to young children).

Each episode features a moral lesson; something that is severely lacking in today's television entertainment.  The characters are enjoyable and mix well with each other.  Unlike many shows of the same genre both adults and children take their turn at wearing egg on their face:  proof that we all make mistakes and that ""growing up"" doesn't stop with physical height.

I hope that Disney will eventually issue a season of this series on DVD and I wish ABC (owned by Disney) would begin showing entertainment like this during the eight o'clock hour (once known as ""The Family Hour"").",1164844800,18,839,4.8321678321678325

2560637,4,B000FC2FY2,"INTRO

I'm a 15-year-old boy, and I have to tell you that a lot of Disney shows aren't as good as they used to be. I loved LIZZIE MCGUIRE and EVEN STEVENS. My number one fav was THE JERSEY! Now, the only 2 shows I can stand on Disney are THAT'S SO RAVEN and THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY.

The only reason I actually watched this show was because I was obsessed with the film BIG DADDY (1999) starring Adam Sandler. And if you didn't know, young Julian (the boy Sandler adopts) is played by the Sprouse twins (Zack and Cody). Anyway, my younger brother was watching THE SUITE LIFE, and I saw the credits say ""Dylan Sprouse - Cole Sprouse"". So I decided to check it out.

REVIEW

I am ADDICTED now! The show is so funny and original it's impossible to not like it! You may have noticed that most Disney shows are extremely similar. In both LIZZIE MCGUIRE and THATS SO RAVEN, the main character has an annoying brother, and two friends (one boy and one girl). THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY isn't like that. Most of the situations on the show are original and funny.

One of my favorite characters is London Tipton, the obvious spoof on Paris Hilton. London's father owns the Tipton hotel chain, and London isn't very bright, and is spoiled rotten! I think they captured Paris pretty well!

THE DVD

Ok, now about the DVD. This is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. These episodes are great, but there are other ones that I wish I had on DVD! I was however excited to see the ""never before seen episode"" on the DVD. However, DO NOT BUY THE DVD FOR THAT. Because in August, this episode will be aired on Disney. Just get your TiVo's ready instead of buying the DVD!

OVERALL

THE SUITE LIFE is an origial show on DISNEY CHANNEL, and does not disappoint. Even though the episode selection could be better, the show is still full of laughs and excitement! Enjoy these episodes, and if you decide not to buy, don't forget to watch THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY on Disney Channel at 6;30 (5:30 central)!

Thanks for reading my review!

2560638,5,B000FC2FY2,"The Suite Life Of Zack & Cody is my favorite show on This Disney Channel. Zack & Cody the funniest Characters on the show & also London is funny,too that she's dumb. The Dylan & Cole Sprouse who play the twins are such cute boys! They should have the Seasons come out on DVD soon!!!!",1153267200,,283,4.163636363636364
2560639,5,B000FC2FY2,"I recently stumbled onto ""The Suite Life"" when channel surfing, since a basketball game had preempted my usual show. I spent the next half-hour laughing until I almost blacked out.

I've since become a fan of the show, and was pleased to hear that the series was finally being released on DVD, though I was a little disappointed to find out that it wasn't a Season set, but only a few selected eps. After all, what if the ones 'they' think are the best are not the ones that you like the best?

That said, studios do sometimes 'test the waters' so to speak, by putting out these limited sets, to see how viable marketing the whole series would be, so I went and bought a copy of this set, to make sure that the whole thing comes out, and I urge you to do the same.  You'll enjoy the exploits of the Martin twins as they turn the Hotel Tipton upside down, and drive the manager, Mr. Moseby, out of his mind! I do! :)

The Suite Life is a fun family show, and one of the best things that Disney has done in years, since ""So Weird"". Their other shows, these days, I'm not so enthusiastic about.",1153180800,14,1091,4.205741626794258
2560640,5,B000FC2FY2,"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is a great Disney Channel Original Series. Please make digitized fully remastered versions of episodes of this T.V. show available online as legal video downloads and make a release of THE COMPLETE FIRST & SECOND SEASONS of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody on DVD as a box season set.

I think it is a shame when companies like Microsoft and Apple use digital rights management (DRM) technology to lock users into a specific format. Apple Computer Inc., locks iTunes Music Store users into their hardware by tying it to iPod and iPod to iTunes in such a way music and videos purchased and downloaded via iTunes cannot play on any rival mp3 player nor can any content bought on a rival service play on an iPod. However, they offer a cross platform solution in the sense it works with Mac OS X and Windows.

Microsoft which sued to offer Windows Media Player for Mac stopped doing so with launch of Media Player 10 and deliberately has put into place policies to lock users into its Windows operating system platform and Media Player software -- although it has made its software compatible with a number of legal download services like the relaunched Napster, WalMart Music Downloads, Yahoo! MusicMatch, RealNetworks Rhaosody etc and offered integration in Media Player 10 with those services in addition to making its software compatible with a number of devices Microsoft's plays for sure solution only works with Windows operating system.

Digital Rights Management if any even on DVDs should not be a burden on consumers. Even with encryption and the security features of DRM technologies consumers should not be prevented from using the content they have as they want as long as they are not breaking the law by doing unauthorized repetitive copying and distribution.

DRM should only exist to deter the rise of pirated bootleged downloads of music and videos. I would like to see THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK & CODY digitized and fully remastered for legal video download on services such as iTunes, MSN Video, Google Video etc. Its not so much offering more choices but better choices that is important a combination of the two would be great. I look forward to the day Windows Media Player is Mac compatible again and MSN Music Store works with the Macintosh Operating System, along with MSN Video and other legal music and video download services Microsoft supports, along with Windows Media enabled devices; and iTunes and iPod work well with others.

That day will be a great day for maximizing consumer choice by offering not just more choices but better choices also should Google hopefully also enter the music download business.

I'd like to see such improvements made in these markets and see The Suite Life of Zack & Cody available by season on such services as legal downloads and on DVD.",1152748800,,2826,4.804526748971194
2560641,5,B000FC2FY2,"I watch The Suite Life whenever I can, and I will be sure to buy this DVD when it comes out.",1147564800,,92,3.4285714285714284
2560642,5,B000FC2FY2,"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is a great show. A fun and friendly kids/family T.V. sitcom. It's great that Disney has most of season 1 already on Apple's iTunes Music & Videos Store compatible with Macs and Windows PCs which work well with their video iPods too plus the first 11 episodes of season 2 are also on iTunes for legal download.

I would like to now make just two requests. One if Disney could please release the rest of season 1 on iTunes and release the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ALL 26 EPISODES ON DVD as a boxed season set.

You did so with the ""The Lizzie McGuire Show Boxed Set - Volume One (2001)"" release which had the first 22 episodes from the Lizzie McGuire series.

Now why not a COMPLETE SEASON 1 RELEASE OF TSL WITH ALL 26 EPISODES OF THAT SHOW! That would be really sweet!

Please don't make The Suite Life of Zack & Cody DVD Taking Over The Tipton a theme DVD with just 5 episodes. Even iTunes has more than 5 episodes.

Speaking again of iTunes please add the following missing episodes from season 1 to iTunes: Hotel Hangout, Thw Fairest of Them All, Grounded On The 23rd Floor (pilot), Rock Star In The House, Smart & Smarter, and Boston Holiday.

ALSO WHAT HAPPENED TO UPDATING iTunes the day after a new episode was released as Disney promised that new episode will be on iTunes the very next day. At least that's what Disney's new CEO Robert Iger (the former Presidernt of the company who took over for Michael Eisner) said when he joined Steve Jobs at the Apple special event where the video iPod was unveiled in October 2005 (Oct of last year) and Jobs talked about how iTunes would then also start selling video.

Now Disney only updates iTunes at the end of the month -- what happened to your promise to update the day after a new episode airs? Thanks again please make it a season set in a boxed DVD release with all 26 episodes of first season of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody on DVD (all 20 already on iTunes plus the missing 6 should be on the DVD). Instead of a single disc release with just 5 episodes make it a 4 or 5 disc release in a boxed season set with ALL 26 EPISODES FROM THE 1ST SEASON OF TSL ON DVD.

Season 2 is missing Neither A Borrower Nor A Speller Bee and still needs to add Bowling which aired April 28th, 2006 -- just yesterday. I give the show 5 stars but Taking Over The Tipton DVD 0 stars.

And then hopefully do the same later with season 2.",1146268800,7,2402,4.22707423580786
2560643,1,B000FC2FY2,"Here I Am In Your Life,

It's about time Disney decided to release a TSL DVD. The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is a great show but am disturbed with the type of DVD release. I would prefer a season release with all 26 episodes on DVD like the Lizzie McGuire Vol. 1 boxed set which had first 22 episodes of that show.

Theme DVDs are terrible. What a ripoff. I am not buying this DVD. It's a waste of money. I'd rather buy all the episodes off iTunes Music Store which has most of season 1 already and some of season 2.

This DVD only has 1 episode of season 1 and like 2 episodes from season 2 -- with one being a never before seen episode. I don't care if its never been seen before. I think I'll wait for the episode to air instead of buying a terrible DVD.
