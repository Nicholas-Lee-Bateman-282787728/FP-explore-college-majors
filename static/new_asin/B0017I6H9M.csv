3172501,5,B0017I6H9M,"Along the same lines as their Mexico DVD, Tot Talk has this introduction to the culture, language, and music of France. It aims for a childrens audience with colorful, relevant visual stimuli, but never insults its target demographic. Sophisticated musical accompaniment from a plethora of French composers is abundant (though they seem to have omitted my favorite- Camille Saint-Saens, but I digress). Highly recommended for any one whose kids show an interest in or may contemplate travel to France. And a great resource for both teachers, schools, and school-related projects, too!",1242259200,3,584,5.428571428571429
3172502,5,B0017I6H9M,"I bought this and the Globe Toddlers Mexico dvd to expose my girls to French.  (The one on Mexico can be played in several languages.  This one just French and English).  They love watching it.  If your child likes Baby Einstein, they will probably like this as well.  It shows different areas of the country to teach about culture, but shows short clips with puppets like Baby Einstein.",1238803200,2,387,4.632352941176471
3172503,5,B0017I6H9M,"My 2 1/2 yr old son loves the ""Globe-Toddlers Adventures in France"" DVD! He is COMPLETELY mesmerized watching the children in the DVD dancing, cooking, and doing things he likes to do. He repeates the spoken words of the DVD, increasing his vocabulary. He asks ""mama, what's that?"" and also tells me what is happening- ""baby cooking"". I feel good about my child watching this video, and appreciate that it keeps his interest for the whole length of the DVD. I like that he is entertained and I know he is actually learning.",1234396800,,523,4.634408602150538

3172505,5,B0017I6H9M,"We ordered the ""Globe-Toddlers Adventures in France"" DVD last month and my 20 month old daughter loves it. We watch it daily in French and she is already beginning to say ""chap"" for ""le chapeau"" and ""chau"" for ""les chaussures"". She adores the music and races around the house doing jumps and kicks when ""the can-can"" plays. The puppet's cafe scenes are engaging and humourous cleverly capturing a typical Parisian cafe experience. I enjoy it! She often runs to me holding the DVD box asking for more. Looking forward to the ""Adventures in Mexico"" DVD.",1215907200,,551,4.810526315789474
3172506,5,B0017I6H9M,We loved this the minute we started watching it.  The puppets are unbelievably cute and my kids particularly found the cow and mouse funny.  They love the chicken/rooster's cocorico sound and always laugh.  It is educational and I hear my kids repeating words.  It is engaging and my kids both watch it all the way through every time.  This is the preferred video in the house.,1212105600,6,377,4.651515151515151

8266045,2,B0017I6H9M,I have both the Adventures and France and Adventures in Mexico DVDs and the Mexico DVD is MUCH better.  You can play both in French.  The first time I played the Adventures in France DVD I thought my player was messed up since it was mostly music and very few words.  This DVD is not worth the money.,1363564800,,300,4.137931034482759
8266046,1,B0017I6H9M,"I'll be brief: I cannot believe so many people give this video 5 stars! With all the grunting that the puppets do, there is hardly any language teaching going on! Come on, be honest, reviewers, and admit that the vocabulary presented on this video is VERY, VERY minimal, with virtually NO repetition (which is absolutely essential for language learning). The Little Pim series is the best one I have seen for teaching French to children; I only wish they made more than 3 DVDs. Don't waste your money on this dreck.",1294012800,,515,4.670329670329671
8266047,5,B0017I6H9M,I picked this because my stepson lives in France and speaks both English and French.  He's two years old and I thought this would be an excellent way for him to learn and comprehend more about his surroundings and familiarize himself with the French culture.  Excellent.,1293753600,,270,4.8478260869565215
8266048,5,B0017I6H9M,"Some of the things that I love about this DVD:
I love that there is music throughout the DVD. I have found that my daughter loves music, so this helped keep her interested.

The puppets are adorable, but they also have real babies and children throughout. I think this is important in order for children to make connections. Especially since the children in the DVD are demonstrating daily life skills, like putting on shoes.

When doing some vocabulary I think it's great that they show the picture and the word while also saying it verbally. It reaches all learners this way and reinforces the meaning of the word.

I love that they offer the option to play the DVD in French. Exposing children to a different language at a young age can be very beneficial for their ability to pick up other languages.

Overall I found this DVD to be very educational. It exposes your children to different aspects of the world that they don't see on a daily basis. It was like taking a little tour of France with the food, music and scenery being portrayed throughout.",1274313600,,1055,4.595744680851064
8266049,5,B0017I6H9M,"Loved this video, as did my young children. Excellent way to introduce them to other cultures in a fun way! Watched by children ages 4 and under and they all loved it, even our 10 week old baby! A+++",1272326400,,199,4.128205128205129
8266050,5,B0017I6H9M,"My 19-month-old daughter loves the France DVD. She is mesmerized by it and literally asks for it every day, pointing at the TV saying ""video video video"". She giggles, laughs, points out and verbally identifies different things in the video (colors, animals, actions, etc.) I love watching her delight in the video and I enjoy watching with her while talking her through the different scenes. She likes watching it in either English or French. The music is terrific and we both enjoy listening to it. My favorite part is watching her jump off the couch to dance her version of the ""can can"" at the end of the video.",1271462400,,615,4.651376146788991
8266051,5,B0017I6H9M,"I have sold this DVD through my boutique retailer shop because it's an adorable showing of French culture for little children.  It has French classical music in the background, adorable puppets, small children acting out the scenes, and a French fashion show displaying Jacadi clothing  - some of France's high quality design (I'm French :-) ).  I have also given away Tot Talk's France Map Placemat as gifts to French students of mine. The design is so attractive and they loved drawing on  them ! I recommend Tot Talk products for babies, pre-schoolers and elementary aged children.",1271203200,,584,4.989690721649485
8266052,2,B0017I6H9M,"I just returned this item for 2 reasons.
The first reason is that it plays only in English and doesn't provide the choice to play in French. It actually did the first time we played it but only this time. We saw the French version the first time and then got stuck with the English version. Our player has never had and still doesn't have issues playing and showing menus with other DVDs we have.
The second reason is that I find the content relatively poor and the editing a bit amateurish.",1269129600,,491,4.3478260869565215
8266053,5,B0017I6H9M,"My 10 month old son absolutely loves this Adventures in France DVD, and so do I. We watch it together and have so much fun. For some reason, the puppet cow makes him giggle a lot. He seems to find her very funny. He loves to watch the children and really reacts with them. It is so adorable to see. I personally love the DVD because it is full of REAL French cultural references, and I feel my son is learning so much about my country. I love the fact that some words are given to the viewers. It is such a great way to start learning reading French. The choice of songs and music couldn't be more perfect. Thanks to this DVD, my little son can already start learning about his mom's culture with great fun. Thanks a million!

8266054,5,B0017I6H9M,"Very colorful and full of all of the stimuli that excite and entertain young ones. A good way to introduce them to the music, culture, fashion, etc. etc. of France with a smattering of French language thrown in. Makes a good companion to the Globe Toddlers Mexico DVD.",1243468800,,268,4.604166666666667
