8593214,5,B00DHHWXTE,"""New Travels"" DVD reminds me about 1990 decade trips to Japan, South Korea, and mainland China.  Since the 1960s I had read about these exotic places, and their relationships between the Chinese Silk Road, the Indian Spice Road, and the European Machine Road.  I need to refresh my memory, and this travel movie makes me happy.",1491782400,,327,4.821428571428571

8593220,2,B00DHHWXTE,"I prefer Rick Steves over Rudy Maxa, but for whatever reason, Rick Steves refuses to do shows in the Far East. Several of my favorite cities are in the Far East.

I purchased this DVD thinking that it would feature a detailed description of the cities. Instead, it featured short vignettes. In the portion of the DVD titled ""4 Asian Cities"" Rudy explored Tokyo, Delhi, Bangkok, and Seoul. I was only interested in Tokyo and Seoul. Tokyo is a beautiful city. It's like Times Square on steroids. However, just as I got hooked on Tokyo, Rudy went to Delhi.

Delhi was my least favorite of the four cities. Although it has a growing middle class, it looked dingy. Vendors sold spices and there were temples, but it wasn't my cup of tea.

Bangkok has an Indian and Chinese population. The city has skyscrapers, mega malls, Buddhist temples, a decent mass transit system, and traffic congestion.

Seoul looked nice. It was almost a mirror image of Tokyo. Once again, however, Rudy didn't really delve into the city.

In ""Food, Drink, & Place"", Rudy visited the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo before taking the Bullet train to Kyoto, which has nice cherry blossoms. He had kaiseki with a Japanese family. Rudy also visited Thailand where some food looked nice and others didn't look safe for human consumption. In Uzbekistan, a country I have no interest in visiting, the national dish is plove. In Argentina, they eat asado (grilled beef).

Rudy visited Canada, but not the Canadian city that I wanted (Toronto). Instead, he visited Montreal and Quebec City. Montreal looks like Paris-lite. It's a nice city, though I still think Toronto is better. 80% of the people speak French as a first language. I found Quebec City boring.

Don't waste your money on this garbage. I wish Rick Steves did some episodes in the Far East.",1394582400,,1815,4.761146496815287
8593221,4,B00DHHWXTE,"Amazon's description doesn't tell you exactly what is on this DVD, so I bought this kind of blindly. So you don't have to do the same thing, the videos on this DVD are broken into six parts which are:

Four Great Cities of Asia - Toyko, Delhi, Bangkok, and Seoul

Food, Drink & Place - A variety of places around the world, including Japan, Turkey, Scotland, and Argentina

Nova Scotia & Newfoundland

Montreal & Quebec City

Islands of Polynesia - including the Society Islands (Moorea), the Tuamotu Islands (Fakarava) and the Marquesas Islands

Tahiti & Bora Bora

Altogether there is a little over 5 hours of video.",1387584000,29,618,4.719626168224299
