969886,2,6305104913,"Carter Wong stars in another, could have been classic Martial arts film.  A story that was slow, confusing, and action that was very choppy, and telegraphed.  But worst of all, the main chericter didn't even beat the bad guy.  What's up with that? Unless you have money to waist, or a friend who did, don't bother.",971913600,,314,4.571428571428571
969887,4,6305104913,"The green crusted sword is the nastiest weapon ever! Great background info to the story; flashbacks, and transitions were outstanding! Camera work nothing to rave about but we are talking about kung fu movies. Great flick!",955929600,3,222,5.194444444444445

7883422,2,6305104913,"Xenon is a crap company that puts out bootleg quality films with nice looking packaging. Don't be fooled, Xenon is great at releasing awful versions of old films that don't need to look worse than what they already do. This film looks blurry and out of focus. The image is cropped, and zoomed in cutting off sides of the picture so you don't know what's going on outside of the frame. This is an awful Carter Wong movie. The choreography is messy, sloppy, and just horrid. The storyline is lame, the characters are annoying, and they are not even worth the time. This is a horrible kung fu movie, and I would skip this one unless you're used to horrid quality bootlegs.",1414627200,,669,4.491803278688525
7883423,5,6305104913,Pretty good quality and I actually like old kung fu movies so much that I would have given it a 3 even if it wasn't to be honest.,1397433600,,129,3.642857142857143
7883424,5,6305104913,Another great classic movie for the collection as i call it a keeper.  Nothing like the Wu Tang Clan to keep you on your toes.,1356048000,,126,4.04
7883425,2,6305104913,"In the movie I saw, the camera work was absolutely horrible, the acting was comically bad, and the Kung-fu was sloppy. I couldn't even force myself to get half way through the film (mainly due to the bad camera work, the focusing was abismal!)Go ahead, take your chances, but don't say you weren't warned!",1248307200,,305,4.666666666666667
7883426,5,6305104913,i can honestly say i have never seen a bad movie with carter wong .like every thing else that he does this movie will become a collector's favorite.great fight scenes and excellent drama,1174003200,2,186,4.666666666666667
7883427,2,6305104913,"Carter Wong is good in this film showing off his swordplay, but overall it lacked a real strong flowing story, and also lacked a great climactic fight.  There were fights all the way through that seemed slow and choppy, and the Main villian didn't seem all that powerful.  You'll think the movie is ok, untill the final fight when you wait for about 10 minutes hoping it will pick up, and then when you think it is, it's over.  For those die hard collectors and fans it's a good film, but if your lookin for off the wall action, pass this one up till later.",978998400,2,557,4.285714285714286
