Sometimes the story is that boring and the characters that dull. But not in the case of Girl for Girl, a movie that somehow wraps an impressive cast around an interesting story and (gasp!) actually manages to make us care about the characters even when they aren't spread eagle naked in front of us.

Now don't get us wrong, folks. There is a feast of flesh on display here, and almost wall to wall sex scenes. And god bless 'em, they even threw in a threesome...and an interracial threesome at that! Yes, the thermostat does reach the red zone in this film and stays there for most of the time.

Sebastien Guy and Jack Lincoln star as Jeff and Ben, two young internet entrepreneurs who are about to go public with their successful dot.com company and score some big time $$$. Ben is getting deeply involved with the lovely Caitlin (Kelli McCarty), a yoga instructor who wants to start her own line of studios. And Jeff finds himself falling for the seductive Sara (Tracy Angeles), the company's latest spokemodel, who seems to only have eyes for Jeff's pocketbook.

The two men conspire to test their lover's fidelity and intentions by having each other attempt to seduce the other guy's girlfriend. This seems to be an easy enough task, but soon turns into a complicated mess of infidelities and hidden secrets that threaten both their friendship and their business. As twist after twist develops we find ourselves becoming more and more interested in these characters, who also find the time to dabble in some fine erotic escapades along the way...which is a very good thing.

A nice side story involves two other employees of the company, Rayna and Glen (Flower Edwards and Peter Gaynor--you may remember him as the befuddled sound man in House of Love ), who provide some comic relief with their bet about who can score four times in the week before the company goes public. Each agrees to forfeit 20% of their impending fortune to the winner, and Flower promptly escorts the lucky UPS deliveryman into the closet for a good head start. Flower has that ability to look positively sexy--yet sweet and innocent--in just about any outfit she is wearing. She seems like the kind of girl you dated in high school or college (or wanted to date), and her amazing smile brightens up every scene she is in.

When the two of them finally get together it is both sweet and rewarding after the building sexual tension that has developed between them. By the way, Gaynor is great in comedic roles and can deliver deadpan with the best of them; he made me laugh out loud a few times.

Sebastien Guy proves that he is the luckiest man working in films today as his character, Jeff, beds both Caitlin and Sara, and also manages to sneak his way into a threesome involving Caitlin's sexy Black roomate and her friend. We get to enjoy the two girls first as they rub, caress, lick and kiss each other poolside as Jeff films them with a handheld camera. Eventually, of course, they give him that hungry, inviting look, and he shrugs before dropping his drawers and literally jumping into the mix. Guy has a knack for making his humping look very convincing as he pulls back and really slaps into the flesh of his partners. He must have been smiling when he showed up for this days' shoot! (God knows he was smiling afterwards...)

My one regret was the music mix, which often rose above the sounds of the lovemaking. This can sometimes lift a viewer right out of a scene by being a bit of a barrier; we can see things happening but we can't hear things happening. It depends on your tastes, I guess, but I do know that the heat level jumps (for me, at least) when you don't have those distractions.

One other thing I liked about this move was that the scenes took their time. We get to see the performers undress for a change, instead of the ol' kiss and then POOF! we're naked and humping in the bed. Lots of passionate kissing, nipple licking, finger sucking, and even some good ass cheek nuzzling added nice erotic touches to many of the scenes. Definitely a good film for couples to watch together.",1120003200,,4219,4.601063829787234
