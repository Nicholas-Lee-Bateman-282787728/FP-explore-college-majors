8413295,5,B00429WO86,"Not to be confused with William Wellman's silent epic nor the long-running US sitcom, the BBC's all but forgotten 1976-7 series Wings is probably the best drama series ever produced about the First World War. Tracing the development of the Royal Flying Corps from its early use as a largely ineffectual form of reconnaissance for artillery to the early days of bombing and aerial combat through the experiences of a handful of pilots, it's a surprisingly lavish production with an epic scope that takes in both family life at home and the experiences of the infantry on the ground for whom aircraft always spelled trouble and who weren't averse to firing on their own planes to deter them in the early days.

The first series focuses on the early days of the war when dogfights took place between pilots armed only with rifles and handguns who would wave to each other after each unsuccessful attempt to kill each other, managing to find a fine balance between the genuine romance and limitations of early flight and its dangers. The aerial scenes aren't that plentiful but are well executed, and there's a good sense of the growing escalation of the war, with the series building up from the paltry basic training to standout frontline episodes like Over the Top, when things start to get nastier and early chivalry gives way to pragmatism.

Best of all, it takes its time to develop characters and situations naturally without ever seeming either rushed or padded out. Tim Woodward's country boy who only gets the chance to actually fly once his `betters' are killed off at such a rate that the RFC is forced to abandon its gentlemen only attitude to pilots, Michael Cochrane's likeable upper class pilot, Nicholas Jones charismatic but increasingly bitter flight commander and John Hallam's war wounded uncle back home might seem at first to be stock characters, but the strong writing makes them credible human beings who don't always act the way stereotypes of their respective classes in this kind of drama. Nor does it always opt for easy stereotypes in the passing parade of supporting characters - far from turning out to be a dead loss, one pompous oaf turns out to be an excellent observer and a superb marksman in the air but resolutely remains an obnoxious pompous oaf who never fits in despite his courage rather than suddenly learning the error of his ways and becoming one of the boys. Instead it manages to accurately portray the attitudes of the day without grafting too modern sensibilities or disillusionment onto its characters: they're convincingly of their time and class even as those times and class distinctions are being worn away by the war.

It's also surprisingly good at the emotional confusion caused by the breakdown in the old class system that happened during the was as the rapid turnover in human lives led to the lines between officer class and other ranks becoming blurred as people were regularly promoted `beyond their station' for the first time: neither side really knows quite how to handle it, so handle it badly. Emotional partings are similarly awkward, with Tim Woodward's hero all-too-convincingly inarticulate when trying to explain to his fianc&eacute; why he broke up with her and failing miserably. The result is a drama that's as compelling on the ground as it is in the air, going beyond its small corner of the conflict to convey a real sense of why the First World War was such a world changing event both at the front and at home in a way few dramas have ever managed before. While the second series sadly veered into Boys Own clich&eacute;s and more obvious in some episodes, the first series is one of the best and most undervalued television dramas of the 70s.

Series two sees the war in the air escalating, along with the body count and sense of doom, and the scope of the series shifting. Sadly in the process John Hallam's character is written out after a single episode, the emphasis of the side plots shifting from the Home Front to the German aviators. The result is a very mixed bag of a series. The action scenes are considerably better than the first series, and not just the dogfights - an air raid and its aftermath in Dawn Attack is particularly convincing - and it convincingly raises the stages as the war moves into a stage where anyone can die - and one prominent character does, his plane still circling eerily long after he does - and where generals refer to infantry casualties as `stuff on the ground.' The relationships shift too as friends fall out and nerves shred, but in the process it increasingly flirts with stock melodrama, presumably in an attempt to chase higher ratings.

Unfortunately it also veers into Boys Own clich&eacute; with a little too much of the kind of comic-book heroics the first season scrupulously avoided, what with characters landing behind enemy lines to take out machinegun nests and kidnap German generals. And it doesn't take long for this sporadic move into action series territory to take hold - it's only a couple of episodes in the run when Nicholas Jones' Captain Triggers falls in love with a beautiful spy, is captured by Germans and sentenced to death and escapes with absurd ease to take his improbable revenge with even more absurd ease. Things do get back on track the next episode as one major character finally cracks under the strain but there's still a tendency towards melodrama, albeit very well executed, in subsequent plot developments. Similarly the character of Kate undergoes not just a change of actress but a complete change of personality, turning from a progressive woman into a catty snob

There's less of an attempt to look at the entire war in the context of what it meant to people at the time and the changes it would herald for the future. Rather than a running thread throughout the series, it tends to crop up in intermittent episodes like Officers and Gentlemen, about the social impact of promoting people who didn't go to the right schools and weren't born with a sense of entitlement to authority (far from going for class war clich&eacute;s, the episode acknowledges that there was more resentment from the `lower orders' who preferred to be led by well-bred idiots when one of their own stepped out of his place) or Guardian Angel, about the opposition - not just from generals but pilots as well - to parachutes, which were still regarded as an `invitation to cowardice.' Then there's The Price, about the problems of developing new aircraft that won't kill inexperienced pilots after being stuck with planes where the only chance of taking down an enemy is a head-on collision, while the penultimate episode does finally deal with troubled relationship with French allies and civilian casualties. But these aren't enough to change the feeling that it's gone from being a consistently excellent series to a series with some excellent episodes.

While the remaining years of the first war in the air provided ample dramatic opportunities, it's perhaps for the best that this never continued for a third or fourth series despite its unresolved ending. It's certainly still a cut above most TV attempts to deal with WW1 and well worth watching, but it's hard not to notice the drop in quality and ambition between the two seasons.

Simply's extras-free UK PAL DVD offers all episodes of both seasons in decent transfers considering the limitations of the original series (as per almost all shows of the day it's a mixture on shot-on-videotape interiors and 16mm film exteriors).",1399248000,,7533,4.8568093385214
8413296,5,B00429WO86,"Wings - a truly excellent series from the glorious decade of British television drama, the 70's! The two series chart the exploits of a small, poorly equipped reconnaisance squadron during the middle of WWI.

For a 70s series, Wings manages to look remarkably undated, by contemporary standards, if you allow for the grainy quality of footage for most of the flight sequences. At no time do you feel that you are not up there with the action and the sets feel real enough to dissuade question too. Some series such as The Sandbaggers are shot mostly on sets and it really feels like it. Not so with Wings.

Whilst being a thouroughly satisfying drama series in its own right, Wings serves to explore several themes and issues of the period, and wartime situation. For example, it explores class issues of the day, and how difficult it was for working class people to compete with officers for recognition and respect; the elitsist attitudes of the air corps inrelation to the foot soldier in the trench; the coming and going of sweethearts and the stupidity of wartime tactics and expectations.

Although it has been nostalgic to see this excellent drama again, at the end of the second series, I was left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. Series two finishes in a reasonably satisfactory manner, however, I cannot help but feel it could have extended into a third series and maybe beyond. Certain story ends seem to be hanging loose, such as the relationship with Gaylion and Lorna. Do they get married. or does Alan finally win het back in the end? Does he deserve her back? Maybe it was supposed to be left that way.

Conclusion: I highly recommend this series to any aficionado of British wartime drama or drama in general.",1360281600,,1735,4.7161716171617165
