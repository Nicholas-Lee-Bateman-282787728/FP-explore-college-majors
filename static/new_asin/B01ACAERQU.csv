7597329,2,B01ACAERQU,"Mediocre. I should have known when I saw it was rated PG. Cheap sudden scares that add little and are the only scary things about this film. It does have some twists, but not enough to sustain it. An ok film for an evening, but not anything to expand the horror film genre.",1460764800,,273,4.169811320754717

7597331,5,B01ACAERQU,I loved this movie. I really enjoy anything with the sea of trees. And the things that have happened in real life in there. I'll definitely watch this again.,1460678400,2,157,4.448275862068965
7597332,1,B01ACAERQU,"Aokigahara, a forest in Japan, is suppose to be haunted by spirits of people who have ventured in there to commit suicide. Yes, there is even a footpath to stay on if you wish to walk in there, but you are warned to stay on the path, and that the dead will not let you leave. But one young woman named Sarah Price, whose twin went in there and hasn't been heard of since, is obsessed with finding her, and even despite being told that she'll go mad in there, books a flight and flies to a city in Japan.
A man befriends her, and along with a Japanese guide, the three enter the forest. She barely knows him, but allows him to come with her. Naturally, they step off the path. As they plunge deeper and deeper in the forest, they just happen to come across what was her twin sister's abandoned campsite. Strange sounds in the night are heard. Poor Sarah. She starts going mad,  but she is already stupid.
Rather than going into more details, I'll just advise you not even to consider buying this terrible movie.",1460678400,2,1010,4.315789473684211

7597334,3,B01ACAERQU,"Were identical twins, if she was dead I would know it. In Japan there is a forest known and the suicide forest. Sara Price (Dormer) has received a call informing her that her twin sister Jess may have killed herself in that forest. Not believing she is dead Sara travels halfway around the world to find her sister. The farther she travels into the forest searching for her sister the stranger things become. This is one of the better horror movies to come out in a while. The movie is not just slasher and actually has a real plot and the fact that the forest is real gives it that extra push it needed. The movie is psychological and deliberately paced, which adds to the overall horror aspect of the movie. This is not a movie that will make you scream and jump, but it will affect you and make you feel a little uneasy and stay with you for a few days. That is what a horror movie is supposed to do. Overall, one of the better horror movies recently and I did like it. I give this a B+.",1456099200,2,990,4.18848167539267

7597336,4,B01ACAERQU,"This is a film that takes place in Japan's Suicide forest that doesn't involve bad dubbing or subtitles. (Points for that.) Sara (Natalie Dormer) gets a feeling something is wrong and her twin sister needs help. Sara flies 6,000 miles to Japan and discovers Jess (Natalie Dormer with black hair) has gone missing in Japan's suicide forest. She manages to get two guys to help her look for her. The film is rather ho-hum up to about 45 minutes into the film when they (plot spoiler!) find her tent. It isn't until this point does the film become worth watching. Then the night time creepy stuff happens as the forest, ""plays with people's mind.""

Make it a rental. 3 1/2 stars

7597338,4,B01ACAERQU,"As a teenager,  this would have caused me to nearly soil my armor.. As an adult, I enjoyed it overall.  Minus one star because Natalie Dormer plays the main character as well as the main character's twin sister. Yep, Double Dormer for the price of one; however,  it gets 4 stars for being a breath of fresh air (no superheroes or princesses). The Forest is based on a real forest in Japan, which truly is mysterious, intriguing and kind of creepy.  I'll admit that I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to movies,  but this one had me captivated. It's certainly at least worth Redboxing for a night of thrills.",1496793600,,612,4.4774774774774775

I found that I personally enjoyed this movie. I am the type of movie lover that sees a movie for what it is, a story. I don't expect to be WOWED all the time. Movies are like books, some books you love and some you just cant finish. Well movies are the same. I think far too many people expect way too much out of a movie and when it falls short of ""THEIR"" expectations, they slammed it. I believe this is the case of The Forrest. I found that The Forrest was rather original and dark. I found it edgy as well as nerve wracking as I can place myself in the shoes of the character that the actor or actress is playing and personally, I would never want to be in the shoes of Natalie Dormers character.

Basically twins who can feel each other across the either go their separate ways.  One sister goes to Japan and disappears into a forest known for suicides.  The other sister, sensing her sister is still alive, goes after her.

7597360,4,B01ACAERQU,"The Forest is about a girl who believes her twin sister is missing in the Suicide Forest in Japan.

In the movie The Suicide Forest represents sadness,isolation,and despair and though the movie was somewhat confusing it was still very intriguing .

The movie isn't terrifying not by any stretch of the imagination but unlike The Boy it's genuinely creepy and suspenseful in parts .

The acting was also pretty good some weak spots here and there Taylor Kinney especially whose acting always comes across as bland but he still did alright.

The twists were involving and the ending was creepy and very well done .

The evil in the film was sinister looking and the make up in my opinion was beautifully done it was chilling how the faces looked .

The movie also has more then one twist which was a breath of fresh air for a change .

I would have bought this if I had seen it in theaters simply because for myself I personally enjoyed it .

As I said it wasn't perfect nor terrifying but it was still creepy and suspenseful and certain parts made me shudder.

I definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes those twisty turny creepy suspense thrillers I wasn't disappointed and hopefully anyone who chooses to rent this or buy it won't be either .

Just take what I say with a grain of salt after all its just my opinion .",1476489600,,1328,4.450413223140496

7597371,4,B01ACAERQU,"I don't think it's fair to bash this movie just because of its slow pace and ""lack of scares"". The slow pace has a purpose, it builds momentum for the intended climax. As for the lack of scares, well... if you're the type of viewer that can only appreciate a gore fest, then this is not for you. Some people like it subtle and artsy and intriguing. I'm one of those.
This is not a masterpiece, sure. The first half of the movie could have done with a better script, maybe. But it's a decent effort from a first-time feature film director working on a subject never explored before. So I guess the director and producers deserve more, at least for the originality, for definitely there will be others in the future who will work on the theme and try to learn from their mistakes.
I also can't understand the criticism that charges the film with being insensitive to the plight of the people who died or committed suicide there. Just because it's based on a true place? Well, the fact is, the forest exists, people commit suicide there, but it is also a fact that the Japanese themselves surround the place with folklore and mythology, and according to their mythology the spirits there turn angry and vengeful. It's not something made up by a Western film director. And it's something that happens so often that maybe a lot of people will call it routine, even though it's really tragic. If it can be turned into literature, why can't it be turned into film? Anyone who knows a little bit about the Japanese folklore involving ghosts will know that there is nothing in this story that is disrespectful.
I choose to give this 4 stars. It gave me the creeps, especially the second half, and I think the end brings a twist very much in the manner of M. Night Shyamalan in his golden days. The devil is in the details, people say, and you must pay attention to the details in this film. The answers are there, even about why Jess is not afraid of the forest as is Sarah, and also about the death of their parents. But if one is only interested in gory horror, one can't expect to understand the clues in the story.",1467676800,2,2109,4.438144329896907
7597372,4,B01ACAERQU,"The Forest isn't a perfect movie by any means, but it certainly was a darn good one. Maybe people are crying and whining because it wasn't full of mindless violence or it wasn't the next Saw sequel. Hell, I don't know. Anyhow, I thought it was a good, tense, and suspenseful movie with an ending I didn't see coming.",1467504000,,316,4.372881355932203
7597373,3,B01ACAERQU,"A young woman is told by Japanese police her twin sister, a teacher in Japan, is missing, having gone into a forest where people generally only go when they wish to commit suicide. This happens so often, it's treated in a rather ho-hum, if sympathetic attitude. Of course she flies to Japan and also enters the forest, insisting on staying all night with an American she meets along the way.

The ending to this movie is inevitable, though it does raise a few questions of why two sisters go into the forest and only one comes out...and why that specific one? Also about their parents' deaths. I truly wished for a bit of an epilogue explaining a few thing .

Much is made about the fact the two are twins and can't be distinguished from each other when in actuality, they look nothing alike (other than the same actress playing both parts, because one has dark hair and wears heavy make-up while the other is blonde and barely wears any, and they merely resemble each other as ordinary siblings would.) I'm thinking if this had been portrayed as a psychological thriller instead of horror, delving into the twin aspect and the parents' deaths, it would gone over much better.

There's really nothing new, but it does have a few moments of shock which actually made me jump, then laugh sheepishly for doing so. There's also a startling lack of blood and gore.

It's a good filler for an evening when there's nothing on TV and you don't want to watch reruns.

Frankly about halfway through the movie I was hoping something would eat the main character and the credits would roll.

The Good: I liked the premise of the movie, and the twins angle. I liked the folklore and history of the forest (I've seen this forest used in movies and tv shows before, and thought it was fairly well done here).

The Bad: the script could've used some tightening up in a few places. There were times when the story lost its footing and the actors stumbled with it.

Overall: while, like The Boy, this movie doesn't stand out, I did enjoy it. The ending was a nice touch, and wrapped everything up well. I'd say it was worth a watch.",1463616000,,625,4.235294117647059
7597383,1,B01ACAERQU,"This movie was so boring.  I love horror movies when they are done correctly, but this was about as scary as doing my laundry.  The only things in this movie that scare you are jump scares and I HATE jump scares.  That's not scary!  Anyone can jump out at you and yell ""BOO!"" and you'll jump.  But that's not scary, that's startling.  That doesn't create an atmosphere of terror, that just makes you worry in anticipation of the next loud noise that is going to make you jump.

The characters were boring, the plot had potential and could have been much better if they had a decent writer.  The special effects were good as well, the make-up effects on the dead bodies were half-way decent, and the backgrounds were okay as well.  So the best things I liked most about this movie were trees, dead bodies, and the lighting.  The actors?  They weren't even on my radar for things I liked about this movie.

7597390,2,B01ACAERQU,"I just got through watching this movie and I have to say, I was rather disappointed.

Some of you may or may not be aware that this film is a sort of a remake of another film called Grave Halloween. Grave Halloween is one of those low budget, made for cable, horror films, that airs on the Syfy channel. So I was partially comparing the two films as I viewed it. To be fair though, The Forest incorporates enough in the way of new material to be taken on its own merits. It also had a few Japanese characters which I liked. But both films have the same problems that I will describe later.

Without delving too far into the plot, The Forest is about a twin sister who rushes to Japan from the U.S. to find her sibling in a haunted forest near Mt. Fuji. The forest is known as Suicide Forest. It got its name due to people going there to commit suicide. However, it also has a reputation of making people see things so they will be tricked into killing themselves. The yuri or angry spirits, are behind the haunting and will feed on anyone who goes in with feelings of sadness or despair. After hooking up with a journalist and a guide, our heroine seeks out her sister before it's too late. After dragging the viewer through twists and turns, and a not so fantastic ending, the film reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

First I'll just talk about The Forest. This film is setup with a good premise in mind. A haunted forest that attracts suicides. But it fails at opportunities to make the story better. That is, it basically puts an American character in a haunted Japanese Forest and tries to scare us without including some of the essential Japanese components. And that's a shame, because Japan is a country with a rich tradition of storytelling. Particularly ghost stories. The J-Horror craze during the early 2000s is testament to that. But here we have a character in a country, where she lost her sister and she doesn't believe in the threat that resides there. She has no connection to the country, nor does she have an appreciation of its culture. She's simply there because the script says, American woman in haunted Japanese forest looking for sister. That in and of itself is a lost opportunity. Japan is known for some pretty creepy ghost tales, none of which is shown in The Forest.

Now I'll connect this film to Grave Halloween. Grave Halloween essentially has the same problems. In that case, its foreign students in a haunted Japanese forest, who don't realize they're ticking off the yuri. However, in Grave Halloween, at least the main character is half Japanese and she has a Japanese mother. In her story, she is looking for her dead mother to perform a ceremony before a certain date, so her mother's spirit won't become a yuri. She also encounters her dead sister in the forest. Granted there were lost opportunities in Grave Halloween too. But at least Grave Halloween comes across as scary and the horror is more intense. And there is some attention paid to the fact that the film takes place in Japan.

So if I compare the two films, I'd have to say, Grave Halloween actually creates a better story overall. The Forest tries to redo Grave Halloween with a bigger budget and a psychological twist, but it falls flat after awhile and the film drags. And for me, the main problem was the fact that the film essentially borrows the location from Japan, but doesn't explore the background or culture very well. In fact, the one area I wanted to know more about was a young Japanese teenager that kept popping up in the film. But there is no background given on her. She's just there to serve as a vessel for the main character to have more horror experiences. To me that was a mistake. The film should have spent some time on who she was, why she was there and what her background was. But we get none of that. We only get this lady, who refuses to believe her sister is dead, making bad decisions, because she has no concept of the haunting that resides in the forest. It's what I would consider a surface level ghost story. Bare bones at minimum. So it becomes rather boring after awhile.

In any case, I gave The Forest 2 stars. I wanted to give it more, but really it needed a lot more work. And considering it was a remake, it didn't make things any better. It got worse in my opinion. However, if you saw this film and liked it, you might want to check out Grave Halloween too. I think it's a better ghost story overall. It's not perfect mind you, but at least you could compare the two films to see what you think of them together. It might also be entertaining to see the similarities and differences between them. Different director's takes on the forest hauntings.",1461974400,,4709,4.4825174825174825
7597391,2,B01ACAERQU,"Sara Price knows something is wrong with her twin sister Jess, so it's no surprise when she receives a phone call that Jess might have committed suicide in the infamous Aokigahara Forest, also known as the suicide forest. Sara drops everything to save her sister as always, convinced that she's still alive. She meets a reporter named Aiden at a bar and interviews her, as he's already writing a story about the forest. They journey together with a guide into the forest to look for Sara, but Sara insists on staying overnight after they stumble upon Jess's camp. Aiden offers to stay with her, but his presence may not be as benevolent as he seems. Is the suicide forest haunted and playing tricks on her or is Aiden responsible for Jess's death?

The Forest (an American film) tries to take on the Aokigahara Forest, a Japanese place famous for suicides, using only white American characters who are attacked by angry, vengeful spirits from the suicides. This film obviously has problems with the premise, the biggest being that suicide is a cultural problem in Japan that's just being used in the film for shock value. Characterizing the spirits of the people who killed themselves there as angry and vengeful is also insensitive to say the least. The Japanese characters don't get much screen time, being relegated to the sensible guide, creepy harbingers, and background nonspeaking roles. The only positive out of all this is that people who had never heard of the forest before looked it up and found out about it.

Now to the actual story. Sara is kind of a boring character. I don't fault Natalie Dormer because she acted well (and usually does). The writing is what was weak. Jess is barely seen onscreen at all. Their situation where Jess gets into trouble and Sara comes to save her comes from Jess's guilt. Their parents died in a murder suicide initiated by their father. Jess witnessed it, but Sara refused to, so now Jess feels like she should have shared that trauma with her twin. I like the way the backstory was presented, showing the actual events while she lied to Aiden. Things get muddied with Aiden. There's a whole subplot where Sara tries to figure out if he's an evil murderer or not. It distracts from the core story and isn't very interesting. Why isn't the two sisters in the forest enough? I liked the scenes where reality and hallucination mix, but the supernatural elements were underwhelming. Overall, it was a disappointing and pointlessly insensitive film.",1461715200,,2493,4.808857808857809
7597392,3,B01ACAERQU,"If you go in thinking this is a horror movie, or wanting it to be another Ring movie, you will be disappointed. I would say its more of a supernatural thriller with a couple of jump scares thrown in. And even the supernatural part of it is pretty light. Are there spirits messing with Saras head, or is it the mental illness that seems to be a part of her family history?

The best part of the movie for me was when Sara starts second guessing her guide, Aiden. It had me guessing as to which direction this movie would be going. Was Aiden really messing with her, was Saras head messing with her, or were the spirits doing it.

As for the rest of the movie, there was nothing too exciting to be seen. They are walking around the forest a lot, but I never felt any tension mounting. And I never got a creepy feeling in the forest, even with all the fog, and the occasional dead body or spirit jumping out. You get some flashbacks to Sara and Jessica (her twin), and we see what really happened to her parents. But other than that, not much goes on.

The one thing where I kept thinking, Really!, was with her phone. They are out in the forest for a couple of days, but she continues to use her phone as a flashlight, and her battery doesnt wear out. Its a small thing, but for some reason, I kept focusing on that. She did use it quite a bit in the dark, which was a nice change of pace, with the audience actually being able see a bit more of what was going on. So I guess I have a love/hate relationship with her phone.

All in all, not a horrible movie. I thought the storyline was wrapped up well. Questions were answered, and of course, they left it open for a sequel.",1461369600,,1673,4.154320987654321

 This woman is sure her sister is alive in some forest. The woman goes looking for her sister despite warnings from others. Strange things start happening to this woman as she searches for her sister. There was a few twists and turns in this adventure but it just wasn't as good and thrilling as I had hopped it would be.",1461283200,,419,4.30379746835443
