8539780,4,6304936834,"If you're a fan of 'B' movies, this one's for you. Tired of 'screaming' ripoffs where you know what's going to happen before it does? This one will surprise you all the way. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is it horror? Yes!! The lack of a budget shows and the acting is mediocre - but you keep wondering ""What next?"" Perfect for frat parties and 'B' film lovers. I would give it an 'almost R' rating. There's a couple scenes that get kind of kinky, but mostly it's just campy. Leif Garrett even makes an appearance (sort of)!!",975888000,,526,4.217821782178218
