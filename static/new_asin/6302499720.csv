7826695,5,6302499720,"I saw this movie in a theatre in Providence, RI, when the movie was first released. It's a very funny movie that would appeal to someone who's from Providence, since the scenes were shot on location in Providence and enlisted some local actors who might be known to Rhode Islanders. I never expected to find this film online, so I was pretty happy to locate it on Amazon.",1457913600,,371,4.470588235294118

7826697,5,6302499720,"I ended up in this movie by accident. I was walking down the street one day and the director grabbed me, ""I've got something special for you""! I was given the part of the heavy metal heckler in the crowd. My bass player and I must have shot the scene 10 times. ""YOUR MUTHA!"" I later bought a copy and enjoy watching it without telling my friends I'm in it. They flip when they see me. It was a fun experience and it is a pretty good low budget artsy film.  Many popular figures and big names of the time were in this local flick.",1416355200,,529,4.038095238095238
7826698,5,6302499720,"I am prejudiced since I knew a lot of the people involved in this movie. Watching it brought back memories of the early hipster art and music scene in Providence, RI. I wax nostalgic whenever I watch it.",1355788800,,203,4.368421052631579
7826699,4,6302499720,"Not for children! That means the little ones as well as those who think ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is serious Oscar material. Or anyone who cares about the Oscars, because the guys that made this film sure as heck didn't. They only took funding from people they knew so they'd have complete control of the project, and they made a true underground cult classic. It's right up there with ""Leningrad Cowboys Go America"", but with much better music courtesy of The Young Adults, a true bar band with an intact soul. There is a 2010 DVD release that I intend to acquire. I first saw this movie back when my grocery store had a VHS section, way back in 1995, and have been wanting and waiting to see it again for 15 years. The clip or two on YouTube only tantalizes all the more.",1311724800,5,774,4.381944444444445
