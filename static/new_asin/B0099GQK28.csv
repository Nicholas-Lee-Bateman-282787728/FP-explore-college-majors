5290542,5,B0099GQK28,"I ordered this dvd from amazon germany...I found this to be so well made and moving.
The friendship between these 2 women is inspiring. I remember as a child growing up in Flushing NY in the 60's that their was a small grocery store and the woman working there had numbers tattooed on her..I remember asking my Mom why..she told me and said I must always be extra kind to that woman. I think I was about 6..but that memory stays with me to this day.
I offer Oma and Bella a huge hug...they remind me of my own Nana ..always full of love for their family and such strong women..inspiring to say the least!
The best thing I have seen all year!
Well done! My only complaint is that I am finished watching! Could watch these wonderful women for hours!",1367107200,,747,4.304964539007092
5290543,5,B0099GQK28,"I would have loved to see a little more cooking, but loved seeing these ladies roam around Berlin and living their lives.",1363737600,,121,4.545454545454546
5290544,5,B0099GQK28,"I've seen many Holocaust films, but this one is a departure. Both featured women are amazing cooks and we learn about their lives and experiences in the camps through their onscreen cooking. Well conceived and directed, this documentary is warm and moving and exemplifies the triumph of the human spirit. Highly recommended.",1363651200,17,324,5.25
5290545,4,B0099GQK28,It was interesting to watch the interaction of these tao ladies. Watching them preparing the food was incredible! I might buy the cookbook,1363478400,,138,5.043478260869565
5290546,5,B0099GQK28,"These two beautiful women radiate such strength and grace. Possibly the best story of friendship, resilience, and love that I have ever seen. I have been unable to forget them.",1362787200,3,176,4.9

5290548,5,B0099GQK28,"Beautiful documentary. Insiders view of two friends who share an apartment, food, and terrible memories. It's so important for us to listen and record the survivors of such terrible events like the Holocaust. Touching. Haunting. Highly recommend.",1362441600,8,246,5.675675675675675
5290549,5,B0099GQK28,i liked the movie. I think Oma & Bella deserve an academy award for their having to endure all those crazy people in the past. Love those ladies for their courage. Actually I think everyone deserves and award for putting up with global insanity and abuse.,1353196800,2,255,4.565217391304348

5290572,2,B0099GQK28,"This was a film showing the daily lives of two elderly women who are Holocaust survivors.  However, they talk about their Holocaust experiences very little, just somewhat at the end, which is understandable.  Nonetheless, a movie shouldn't be described as two people sharing their Holocaust experiences when that's not what they do.  This film just showed them doing day to day activities like cooking, getting their hair done, drinking juice at a caf, etc.  So overall, even though the two lead characters do seem quite nice, it was just super boring to watch them.  Also, the film is in German with subtitles, which I did not realize until after purchasing it.  As a side note, since the numerous 5 star reviews are so dramatically different than what is reflected in the actual content of the movie, I am skeptical of their genuineness.",1478649600,,839,4.873239436619718

5290574,4,B0099GQK28,This was a touching and well made film.  The tragic events these courageous women lived through are interwoven with the love and dedication and passion for old world Jewish cooking.,1468627200,,181,5.033333333333333
5290575,4,B0099GQK28,This was a good documentary.  Glad to see these two ladies overcame the holacaust and did well for their remaining years.,1468540800,,121,4.761904761904762
5290576,5,B0099GQK28,"Just follows two great very lovable older ladies in their everyday lives; the mundane is underlain by the profound perversity of a genocide lived by both, but not spoken of by either for the most part.  How it seeps into their lives, how cooking and home and friendship take on a whole new meaning, are all so powerful and we only get a glimpse near the end of why they don't talk about their extraordinary past, mostly the movie itself is pretty banal on the surface.  There is almost more power in the silence.",1464912000,,512,4.4361702127659575

5290615,5,B0099GQK28,"Sweet, touching film about the filmmaker's grandmother (Oma) and her friend Bella, with whom she lives in Berlin. I would have loved to have just a little more background on how the two met and who is featured in the Shabbat dinner scene. Great film, highly recommend.",1436400000,,268,4.723404255319149

5290617,5,B0099GQK28,"How do you describe a one of a kind , so delightful movie such as this one? You have 2  ladies with the most engaging, fascinating personalities there will ever be, who actually were starved almost to death in World war 2, Holocaust survivors who lived by their wits and Gods' Grace. There are many interesting quips about their lives in the concentration camps interspersed into this true documentary. We have only began to describe this movie, for it deals a lot with their fascination with food, not just ordinary food, but Polish food, and lots of genuine Jewish dishes such as Borscht, and Knishes, Blintzs...are you hungry yet? I only wished I had ""smelevision""! These are extraorddinary ladies that I have seen in many history books on WW2, who survived as partisans deep in the forests of Poland, actually living in way below zero weather for a long, long time...I actcuall purchased this movie, and am so happy I did! I look forward to watching these dear precious Jewish ladies, and their lovely families many, many times!",1411776000,4,1032,4.797752808988764
5290618,5,B0099GQK28,An absolute touchy sweet story about two Holocaust survivors who are the best of friends. We learn about their lives through their stories and their cooking.  There is even a cookbook that gives you the recipes of exactly what they cooked (and more) from the movie.,1411430400,3,265,4.760869565217392
5290619,4,B0099GQK28,"A cousin once said to me, 'We only wanted our parents [ who were children during WWII] to love us and spend time with us.', to which I replied, 'They gave us three hearty meals a day, plus snacks. That was the greatest love they could conceive.'

So if you had a mother or grandmother who survived World War II and came from the east, you will understand the paramount  importance food, cooking, and being able to feed your loved ones holds for people who were basically starved during their formative years.

In this gentle documentary, Alexa Karolinska films her Granny and her Granny's  best friend, Bella, going about their daily lives, which includes a trip to the market, various sites around Berlin, the hairdresser, and of course, in their kitchen, cooking [ I especially loved the way Bella takes a razor to pigs feet and chicken thighs]. They primarily concoct Eastern European poor peoples' food, since Bella originally hailed from Lithuania and Granny from Galicia.

Slowly, though they are at great pains not to shock the filmmaker, they reveal their life stories- about the postwar years, their marriages, children and adjustment to life in Germany, where they choose to remain after the war. There is very little here about their experiences in the camps, though one can see they are still deeply traumatized and saddened by it. Granny was only twelve years old when she was rounded up, Bella was older and lost her clothing shop. You feel the pain and tragedy when Granny says she was eighteen when she was liberated--and missed her entire youth and all the formal education she would have had. Bella still has nightmares about the Germans, the arrest of her family and the death of her father which haunt her into old age.

It's pretty amazing that the two women, despite this, were not only able to overcome the past and build new lives but remain in Germany, regarding Germans themselves as individuals and sometimes forming friendships with them. Touching, uplifting and sweet. If  you miss your Grandmother and her generation, you will love it. Mine, at 97, is still alive and a holy terror.",1409788800,16,2112,4.81767955801105
5290640,5,B0099GQK28,"I loved this film.  I have learned so much from Bella and Oma.  If you need to learn from your mom or grandma and you missed anything growing up, this film will enrich you.

Before watching Oma and Bella, I have never had the chance to listen to such incredible wise women whose hearts and words moved my own to heights and depths and joys and sorrows.

This movie is for anyone who loved a mom or a grandma, has lost either and misses them, who has lost anything precious, who just needs a pick me up, a hug, and they will get some deep respect while they watch and listen.

FYI there are links online for the recipe to the sugar cookies that Bella insists the granddaughter have.  The recipe is a revelation.
It makes the most gorgeous puff pastry cookie.  Also, you can find the sugar online and it adds the best crunch.  Look for pearl sugar.  These are incredible.  I had no idea what to expect.  Not too sweet, and just so elegant and sophisticated in their perfect simplicity.

Oh, and there is a cookbook, a sweet little gem of a cookbook that you can also purchase online.  If you like to cook it is so worth it!  It is so beautifully bound, illustrated, and the content is incredble.  The artwork fits the move like a glove.

My hat is off to the director for sharing her family with the world.  We needed this film.  It filled a void for me.",1403654400,10,1352,4.255905511811024
5290641,4,B0099GQK28,"Story of a beautiful friendship, made stronger by the women's bond of surviving a horrible time but also fully enjoying life's good moments. If you remember growing up with regular Friday night dinners, with the whole family gathered around (or Shabbat dinners), there's a scene that will bring some tears when you think about parents or others who are no longer with us. But this movie's not a downer! Rejoice with these women! I hope I have some of their independence, determination and humor when I reach their age!",1398211200,,518,4.831460674157303

5290646,4,B0099GQK28,"My critique is not neutral, and rather self-involved. I lived in Berlin for 13 years, from 1995-2008 and this documentary reminds me of all that is so lovely about the German hauptstadt. Both subjects of the documentary are Holocaust survivors, Jews from the Eastern European diaspora who stayed in Berlin after the war, and displacement. They are two tough birds, well into their golden years.  I love their constant cooking, and wise cracks.  These ""omas"" are fierce, mouthy, and they keep the legacy of Jews in Germany alive in their kitchen, their Yiddish-Deutsch, their friendship, as they celebrate with family, hair-dressers, and each other. Ganz suss, die beiden- this documentary is an homage of  youth recognizing the much more interesting perspective of the old.
The director - a granddaughter of one of our damen -  highlights her lovely elders, and so the material is like a photo album one finds hidden away. If you are interested in Jewish/German history, love Berlin, than this is a sweet way to see die schmutzige wahrheit.",1374019200,,1040,5.02906976744186

5290648,4,B0099GQK28,An adorable and interesting character study. They're fascinating women. Way more about being a Jew during WW2 than I expected. Some very poignant moments.,1370390400,,154,5.458333333333333

8538042,5,B0099GQK28,"5 mins. Into film and already, I love these women! My grandmother passed away 17 years ago and I've been missing her terribly!! As I am now approaching 40 and now a grandmother myself, there is so many things I wish I could ask her and speak with her about. She grew up during the depression era and spoke of it often. I use to love listening to the stories of her life. The older I get, the more I wish I had asked her about so no doubt this is going to be a treat to watch. To me there is no greater joy but to listen to our elders and learn of the life that once was and how amazingly different times are compared to now. Thank you to the creator of this film, its very comforting. For those viewers who are younger and still have their grandparents, please sit down with them and ask them to tell you about ""the good ol  days"" cause once they are gone, so are their stories unless someone else got the privilege of hearing them to pass them on. Its truly a gift!!",1502064000,,967,4.036458333333333
