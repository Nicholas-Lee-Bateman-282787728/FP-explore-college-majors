6095420,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"This film that is The Adventurer The Curse of the Midas Box features the tale of a man named Mariah Mundi who unexpectedly gets involved in a very dangerous adventure after his parents Catherine Mundi (Keeley Hawes) and Charles Mundi (Ioan Gruffud) come up missing and his younger brother Felix Mundi (Xavier Atkins)is kidnapped. Fortunately Mariah Mundi gets help from Captain Will Charity (Michael Sheen) who gives him an undercover assignment at a hotel where he reports to Monica (Lena Headey). Naturally, Mariah Mundi ends up being surprised when he also sees Otto Luger (Sam Neill) at the hotel.",1500768000,,601,5.08080808080808

6095431,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"I very much enjoyed this production. Aneurin Barnard plays a young man whose parents are kidnapped by a villain Sam Neill. He and his brother are given halves of an ancient amulet that will open a treasure box that will turn objects into gold. His younger brother also disappears and he searches for his kidnapped family. His search leads to Prince Regent Hotel which has many secret passages. Ioan Gruffudd plays his father. He is aided by a young seamstress at the hotel. The scenery is very moody and picturesque. Michael Sheen portrays a friend who assists him in his search. There is an added section, the Making of the Adventurer. The ending hints at a sequel and I hope that film makers continue the adventures of this young man who is looking for his parents.",1481673600,,767,4.647058823529412

6095436,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"It's a pity this film didn't get the premonition and response it deserves. It was clearly created with the intention that there would be sequels and it would have made for very enjoyable series. Production values are top-notch and beautifully realized. Cast is likable and the characters have plenty of room to grow. A good,solid family film  for those who like their fantasy mixed with a healthy dose of adventure.",1476057600,,415,4.928571428571429
6095437,1,B00GOHZV6Q,"The book is probably good, but the movie didn't make me want to read it! Poor acting and poor script.  And the story lacked the ""magic"" of Harry Potter or Percy Jackson that makes you think there's always possibilities that the unbelievable could actually be true.

6095459,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"I found the movie to be entertaining. A decent enough adventure story, taking place in 1885 England. It is not a fast paced movie. There are English subtitles for the hearing impaired and an extra on the making of Adventurer. As the credits start at the end, KEEP WATCHING or you will miss something IMPORTANT.  They've also left it open for a sequel, which would be fun if they do.",1454371200,,382,4.457142857142857

6095463,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"Is this the most spectacular film I have ever seen? No. Is it a movie I could lay on the couch and watch withyour 7 and 8 year old Sons without having to wince at the thought their mother might find out? No as well. Its just good clean family fun. My boys thought it was awesome and it was mildly entertaining. Sometimes you can look past the soft plot line and the mediocre acting and just accept a movie for what it is. Now my boys are asking about a sequel, after all it has an open ended last scene.",1449878400,2,503,3.99009900990099

6095469,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"While good, its not great. Watched it with our 12 year old who had a hard time following it. It felt like there were to many elements in it. The characters were not compelling enough. For example, someone dies after they repented of their way but I didn't feel like shedding a tear for them.  I gave it four start because is was clean, well constructed cinematically, and good basic story. There is great potential in this idea of a secret society that defends relics. To be four starts I wanted there to be some significant twist or a major element of surprise.",1442707200,,562,4.456310679611651

6095472,2,B00GOHZV6Q,Too easy to the point of stupid. Although made the plane ride go by but just mildly entertaining,1440806400,2,96,4.388888888888889
6095473,5,B00GOHZV6Q,This is a nice movie. But looks like it missing something. Like the rest of the story.,1439683200,,86,4.117647058823529
6095474,5,B00GOHZV6Q,I didn't have any trouble playing the movie.  The movie was not bad.  A good adventure. Interesting story line.,1439596800,,111,4.7894736842105265
6095475,2,B00GOHZV6Q,"This movie bored me from beginning to end. The characters seemed blas throughout the story. This dvd gives you the impression of being a family movie, but there's considerable cruelty in this story in my estimation. Sorry, total thumbs down.",1439424000,2,241,5.05
6095476,3,B00GOHZV6Q,I categorize this movie as just OK ... nothing spectacular.  The storyline was interesting but seemed to plod along. I wound up donating it to my local library.,1439251200,,160,4.714285714285714

6095482,1,B00GOHZV6Q,"This is a kid's movie, reminiscent of an old Disney movie.  I thought it was rather boring and couldn't finish it, despite trying twice.",1434240000,,136,4.666666666666667
6095483,1,B00GOHZV6Q,Boring. Just plain boring,1432598400,,25,5.5

6095485,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"I love the setting, the clothes and props &  the basic storyline.  The actors do give it their all but I guess its more script then actor/more director  choices.  I wish the kids could have been more the hero's.  Not to give story away, but there were several instances where they could of defeated the bad guys/girls and not wait for the adults.  Needed more common sense as well, when chased out of their house, I would of watched to see if I could go back in, for clothing at least and to steal a bit of food.  Why keep the necklaces right on you? I would of opened a security box or at least hide it in unlikely spot. too many things were done to advance the plot a certain way.  I have not read the book and I will do so, so not sure if it was following the book exactly.
All in all, would I own it, no, would I see it again, sure- in a few years. Would I see more if another sequel came out, yes, nice ending that surprised me.  So four stars for a clean movie with great affects and scenery",1432339200,,997,3.994949494949495

6095487,4,B00GOHZV6Q,Surprised - cute movie.  Really enjoyed the adventure.  Great for young tweens.,1430438400,,79,5.5
6095488,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"A superb movie.  I really can't understand why an overhyped snooze-fest like Transformers: Dark of the Moon made over a billion dollars and this movie didn't.  This movie has an actual original plot, good acting, and interesting characters.  I have to think that the ""professional critics"" are jaded by the age of the CGI super-films.  That, or else the payola wasn't there for this one.  In any event, I can heartily recommend this film for fans of action adventure without gore, profanity or nudity.  In other words, a movie the way it should be made, to entertain rather than to degrade the senses.  Kudos.",1428796800,,609,4.798076923076923

6095495,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"This really was a good family movie. We are picky about what our kids watch, we have a couple that are sensitive that have had night mares.  So many times we see reviews that say 'good family movie' and realize that everyone has different standards.  This kept the violence to a minimum and yet still had suspense and a good story line.  No language, no sexual junk.  If you are a Christian family, there are some tarot cards in there, but we just talked about it afterwards.

I am surprised by the 1 star reviews. Do they know the real meaning of 1 star?  I think people are 1. Spoiled by big budget epics,  all of which must be  the biggest yet or it is a failure.  2. Review trolls.  The Web allows every viewer to be an instant, anonymous exoert--and snobbish ones at that. I too dislike wasting time on poor movies or books,  but this movie is not at all in that category. We've forgotten how to be entertained (storytellers, local plays...). This movie reminded me of those times. Get some popcorn,  turn down the lights, and enjoy an evening of clean, fun adventure and entertainment.

Several times I started to stop watching it. I forced it through because I like Sam Neill. If I had to do all over again, I would never buy this movie and would instead wait until it was available to watch for free on prime. Then I wouldn't feel that I had invested money unwisely, which I certainly do now.",1415318400,,441,4.2

6095510,3,B00GOHZV6Q,"This movie is similar to The Librarian series ( of movies) in quality & type.
The action, script & colors all feel very familiar.
Probably this would appeal to 6th graders & under, who don't have too high expectations (because they've already seen x-men, or avengers etc.) Leaves room for sequel that sadly will probably never come so ending is a real tease",1414454400,,357,4.682539682539683
6095511,2,B00GOHZV6Q,"Seduced by the trailer, I thought this would be a fast-paced, fun, light-weight bit of entertainment.  Boy, was I wrong - especially about the ""fast-paced"" bit.  It's slow, dull, slow, draggy, slow...  It's definitely not fun, though it's certainly ""light-weight.""  It has a ponderous script, scenes that would benefit from LOTS of cutting and tightening, uninteresting characters, an over-the-top (and therefore boring) villain (and villainess), and so much unbelievability that any attempt at a plot is constantly undermined.  (For example - spoiler alert here - when our heroes locate the INCREDIBLY secret, hidden, buried, forgotten, undetectable location of the secret object, it later turns out to have an OPEN GRATE over the top of the chamber that communicates to an upper floor!!!

6095517,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"You HAVE to understand this from the getgo.  This is NOT an adult's film, so you cannot judge it as such.  It is a FAMILY film, one that the kids will love because it has a lot of adventure in it. If they loved the Harry Potter films, they will like this one.  As as adult, I enjoyed it for various reasons. (1)The casting was excellent (2)The plot was good. The Victorian period was very interesting, and there always seemed an aspect of it that was rather mysterious/romantic (3) STEAMPUNK!!  There are a lot of rather fascinating futuristic creations, so that also held my attention.  Plus, just when you think that the movie is over and done with and they begin rolling some of the credits...they stop! and add a codicil to the story-something that you would Not have expected.

6095528,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"I got this DVD because I saw the preview included with another movie I'd ordered.  Technically a Young Adult steampunk, it's fast-paced and has enough action for adults, too.

After a wounded colleague interrupts his father's lecture and give his mother a broken amulet, young Mariah Mundy's left is turned up-side down. His parents disappear, he and his younger brother Felix end up in a Crown reformatory and Felix is abducted by two mysterious men while Mariah is saved by the same colleague. It seems Captain Charity and Professor Mundy are members of Her Majesty's secret Bureau of Antiquities and they're to prevent Otto Luger from obtaining the Midas Box which not only turns items to gold but is a dead weapon also.

Mariah finds himself on the way to an island resort in the North Sea where, with the help of assorted characters and a winsome little seamstress, he will attempt to thwart Luger's plans and rescue Felix.

A fairly fast-moving story and while its absence of blunt language and sex may disappoint some, it's an enjoyable story in the Indiana Jones mode.  One trivial point puzzling me at first is that I'd always considered Mariah a girl's name and there was a moment's confusion sorting out it was the male title character. The twist after the end-credits is a teaser for the next movie which I understand has been in ""pre-production"" since 2012. Since this film was released in 2013 (with apparently little promotion here), that probably means it'll never be completed.  A pity, I'd look forward to it. Unless they hurry, doe-eyed Aneurin Barnard, a 28-year-old playing a 17-year-old, will soon grow out of the part. He's handsome, appealing, and athletic and guess I'll have to look for him in the several other movies listed under his resume.",1404086400,,1769,4.8604651162790695

6095538,1,B00GOHZV6Q,"Personally I'm a fan of all the main actors in this movie, and was intrigued that this would be a fun mix of ""Around the World in 80 days"" and ""National Treasure."" With the advertised cast and adventure genre, I wasn't expecting high entertainment, but just something fun. This movie was far from either of those things.

The main problem this movie suffers from is that it takes itself too seriously. ""Around the World in 80 Days"" embraced its own camp and was entertaining as a result. This movie desperately wants to be ranked in a higher caliber, but simply cannot because it puts the story in the hands of two inexperienced youth and weighs down their already limited talent with painful expository dialogue.

Despite the movie's attempt to pass itself off as a riveting adventure centered around technology and ancient artifacts, the story moves very slowly trying to build tension, but instead breeding boredom and lessening whatever remote sympathy you ever had with the main character as he continues to blunder in stupidity. Even as the plot ""climaxes"", the quality of the writing, dialogue, and story gets continually worse. And somehow manages to worsen even the movie has ended.

For 25 million they did get a movie with great sets and fairly good actors. What they needed was a better screen writer. No doubt if I knew the book, which I assume is aimed at the YA steampunk audience, I would have followed the plot with more clarity. This isn't a bad movie but there are plot jumps that leave you wondering if you missed something while reaching for some popcorn. Definitely needed those transitions that are probably on some cutting room floor. While it seems clear this film was shot with a sequel in mind, you can watch it as a stand alone. Basically if you are home and it's a rainy or snowy day and you want a well shot escapist film to watch then this is a contender. Plot is simple: Before parents disappear they hide two parts of amulet with their children along with a cryptic warning; younger brother gets taken by bad guys; older brother goes in search of younger sibling and gets some help along the way; and relatively happy ending with cliffhanger.

The use of the pumping station was also perfect. Costuming was nice as were props.

Passes time slowly. The characters are one one-dimensional and exaggerated. They did toss in a tad of ""Warehouse 13."" There is some good action near the end.

Possible plot depth is waylaid for references in the dialogue that ring a bit too much like clues to future episodes. That being said, this group of capable and seasoned actors do what it takes to bring us with them as they journey through moments of physical challenge, desire and the ageless conflict of 'good versus evil'. My overall experience of the film was that I found myself shifting from letting go and enjoying the characters that some of my favorite actors were developing...to losing my connection to the story when elements of high action and special effects took more importance. It is difficult to create a memorable film in this genre. ""Midas Box"" straddled an invisible line. Is it building a story, with well developed characters who might lead us to some gem of storytelling, or is it providing a fun and adventurous 'comic book-esque' romp, a movie to relax after a tiring work day in mid-week?

They are investigating an artifact that may be dangerous.  A gang is hot on their trail and they must determine their father's involvement and what the ultimate use of an unusual box may be.  This movie has an excellent cast and production values.  If I have any complaint it is that it leaves the door open for a sequel, which is fine as long as they make it.

It was kind of cute and would have made a good made for TV movie, but it fell short as an actual movie.  I haven't read the book, so I had no preconceptions before watching the movie.  I found it to be poorly directed.  It's difficult for me to put into words.  It seemed to skip things in the plot almost like a synopsis instead of the entire movie.  There were so many plot holes.  They were rather easy to bridge, but it just made watching the movie unenjoyable.  It could have been fantastic, but it was simply poorly directed, maybe even a poorly written movie adaptation with bad acting.

I would not have picked Aneurin Barnard to play Mariah.  He just didn't seem to fit the character.  Mariah Mundi was supposed to be 15 years old (from the book -- 17 in the movie), but Aneurin seems much older, too old for this character in my opinion.  I can't put my finger on it, but I wasn't impressed by the acting skills of the Aneurin (Mariah) or Mella Caren (Sacha).  Actually the only ones I did like were Xaviar Atkins (Felix) and Keely Hawes (Catherine Mundi).

6095559,3,B00GOHZV6Q,"***Minor Spoiler Warning***

Britain, the late 19th Century, a man is being chased. Bleeding profusely, yet refusing medical attention, he pushes on until he can deliver a vital message. A message that has the potential to change the course of history.

Reminds me a bit of another YA effort from 2008, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Mountain/dp/B003MWSAKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Mountain</a>' which also starred Sam Neill. And like that film - this adventure/fantasy comes close to being an enjoyable film. It has the right elements, the scenes are visually rich, and the story an interesting twist on an old mythological tale.

Tells the story of one Mariah Mundi. He and his younger brother Felix are sons of two famous English explorers. It's his parents that the bleeding man is desperate to see again. After the message is delivered - mom and dad vanish. Suddenly, the privileged and sheltered life he's known is about to be shattered forever.

Soon he and Felix are on the streets, hungry and desperate. But even in the flea infested dark corners of society - they're being hunted for reasons they can't understand.

For all its textural quality and exciting premise - this film plays very flat.

Most of that can be blamed on Director Jonathan Newman, whose lack of logical storytelling left many aspects of the film unfinished and incomplete. Example: When Mariah and Sacha are trapped in one of the maze cells - he discovers sunlight coming from a broken portion of the wall - it's a way out of their prison.

Understandably, Sacha - a simple seamstress - panics at their confinement and begins desperately grasping at the rock wall to widen the opening. Mariah attempts to warn her against such action since it could open the entire hold, which sits precariously several hundred feet above the pounding sea. But how does he know this?

What should be an easy explanation becomes another moment where the audience has to mentally bridge the gap. The director should have cut to Mariah also noting sunlight peering from beneath their feet - a simple and quick 2-second scene. One that Newman fails to incorporate. So we aren't rewarded with the Indiana Jones-like moment the director was attempting. <shrug>

Scene after scene plays like that. Why does the lowly bellhop carry a key that opens the secret elevator? Why does Mariah reveal his identity to Monica? Why does young Felix use a hatchet when working in the mines? And worse, why does he, or any of the children for that matter, work so hard pounding the rocks which are already rubble and does not lead to the location of the Box itself?

Why, why, why.

Ack. So many 'whys' that it just killed the movie's energy, leaving the audience struggling to deal with innumerable plot holes.

We all know where the details lay. Apparently Director Newman did not.

Additionally, I thought Aneurin Barnard was too old for the role. i would've enjoyed the character if he wasn't a twenty-something seemingly trapped in arrested development. Awkward.

'Midas' struggles to blend elements of 'National Treasure', 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom' with just a touch of 'Harry Potter' into the mix - and fails to do so convincingly.

6095573,1,B00GOHZV6Q,"About a year and a half ago I wrote a review of a great book named Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box written by G.P. Taylor.  I really enjoyed the book (as I have others by Mr. Taylor).  There was more good news, not only had the book been optioned for a film, but it had begin production.  This was happy news indeed.  I began following the film on Twitter shortly after getting a twitter account.  I was very excited about this book becoming a film.

I first became concerned with the film when the release of the film was pushed back from spring of 2013 until winter of that same year.  Not a huge deal to be sure, but still, not something I like to see.  Then in the fall of 2013 I noticed that they had changed the title of the film.  It was no longer titled after the book.  Now it was The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box.  That is a decidedly cheesy sounding name.  Something a made for TV movie on SciFi or TNT staring Noah Wylie would be named (you know what Im talking about).

Then I found out it was going to be in limited release in January of 2014.  But it was available to watch on DirecTV via On Demand in November of 2013.  Thats really bad news.

Well I just watched it.  And Id bet it might possibly be the worst book adaptation ever committed to film.  It is horrifically bad.  There are characters with the same names as the books, but almost all of their motivations are different.  Mariah now has a brother, who is named after a character that is barely in the book, and is no friend of Mariahs.  His parents feature much more prominently and are changed significantly from the book (particularly his father).  Even the Midas Box itself is different.

If youve read the book, please don't see this movie.

If you haven't read the book, please, don't see this movie.

Its one of those films you try to figure out how to reclaim the lost hour and a half you wasted watching it.  Honestly I couldn't say enough bad things about it.

So, Ill leave it at that.  Dont see it.",1392681600,8,1996,4.222811671087533
6095574,1,B00GOHZV6Q,"I don't usually bother giving bad reviews, but this was SO terrible I must.  I was ready for a fast adventure-cum-fantasy, ready to suspend belief and lose myself on a magical journey.  What a sad disappointment.  Nice filming, nice sets and scenes, decent acting, a few good lines (only got halfway; couldn't go on), BUT the writing and/or directing was all over the place.  There was a bit of everything magical and fantastic, but it just jumped from one thing to another with not even a shred of credibility to hold it together.  Seems a lot of people liked it (?), but it was a complete waste of money and time for me.",1392681600,7,622,4.469026548672566
6095575,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"I have watched this film today and I think it is a wonderful family film. No sex no nudity and very understated acting which I find refreshing .My only gripe is, it seems to have had very limited showing in American cinemas and so has not been given the publicity it deserves. This is an English film, filmed in the u.k  and yet we are still awaiting its release in Great Britain. I hope the public will ignore  some of the very negative views of some of the American critics and buy this dvd. If you want a  good family film that appeals to all ages then this is the one to buy. I would love to see this on a big screen as the photography is beautiful.",1392422400,3,653,4.0859375
6095576,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"Before Mariah Mundi's parents go missing, his mother tasks him with keeping his brother safe, and entrusts both sons with the piece of an ancient Egyptian amulet. But he soon finds himself entangled in a quest for the fabled Midas Box when Felix, his younger brother, is kidnapped by the same organization that his parents have fallen afoul of. Help comes to him in the form of a man named Charity, who sets him up as a porter in the hotel where the villainous Otto Luger is keeping Felix, and where he learns the amulet may have a darker secret than he ever expected.

The story unfolds quickly, and for a low(ish) budget, independently produced film, I was left impressed with how high the standard was set from the scripting to wardrobe. The Victorian costumes are lovely, the paltry use of CGI not one bit detrimental to the visuals. The plot was original, where unexpected developments abounded, and while technically a young adult movie, it was more than mature enough for any age to enjoy. It may not be the absolute best in the genre when compared to other period sci-fi/adventure films, yet this still held its own nicely.

As a bonus, there was no standard Hollywood glorification of filth or depravity here - just a solid movie that provided me with a much needed steampunk fix.",1392336000,26,1289,4.674008810572687
6095577,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"I agree with the other reviewers here, this movie has all the elements one looks for in a good adventure, family friendly, fast paced film. The steampunk elements are always intriguing and add an aspect of mystery and wonder. The character development was well done and within moments the viewer is ready to follow the adventurer on his quest.

The only part I did not particularly like was the design of the box later on...but in the light of the rest of the film it was forgivable.

I definitely hope to see a sequel! Enjoy!",1392336000,4,526,4.526315789473684
6095578,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"A nice family movie with enough villains and mystery to please most anyone.  Did not expect the caliber of acting or story, so am pleased we rented it.  We like Sam Neil as a hero, but he makes a great villain in this movie.  (Some mild violence and 'scary' parts (a well-done night monster), so not for little children--but great for 6 and up)  Thanks",1390867200,15,352,4.369230769230769

You will not be disappointed if you love the old mysteries.",1390435200,37,365,4.73015873015873
6095581,4,B00GOHZV6Q,"I saw the film On Demand, and watched it several times. Engaging story, fine performances and a plot that put me in mind of ""The Librarian"" franchise.  The kidnapping and exploitation of kids by Otto Luger (Sam Neill) in his search for the Midas Box, might be scary for very young children, but that can be tempered if seen in the company parents or guardians.",1390262400,3,360,4.538461538461538

6095583,4,B00GOHZV6Q,I gave this movie 4 stars because it is a good famliy movie with an interesting story and characters. The action was good but not overly intense and you don't have to worry about crude or foul language.  The story was weak at times but actors like Sam Neill and Michael Sheen make those moments pass quickly.,1390089600,8,308,4.4035087719298245

There aren't enough movies in this genre and so I'd say SEE it for sure if you like Adventure/Action/Sci Fi or Fantasy type movies.  I personally LOVE them so i'm always looking for something to get a ""fix"" on (I am a Star Wars, Star Trek, Avatar, Indiana Jones LOVER)......so if you like that type of movie I'd say YES - see it for sure.",1388707200,39,516,3.9423076923076925
6095588,3,B00GOHZV6Q,"The movie started out interestingly enough but didn't keep my attention throughout.  The acting was good.  However, some of the character's behaved in ways that didn't make sense.  Also, the character's themselves weren't very interesting.  I found myself losing interest in Mariah's story even as it was coming to the end which is usually when my attention is highest.  If I could give a rating between 2 and 3 stars I'd give it 2.5 stars.",1388275200,3,440,4.8133333333333335
6095589,5,B00GOHZV6Q,"This movie brings to mind young captivating quest movies such as Golden Compass, Hugo or Narnia but with a dash of Indiana Jone's and Sherlock Holmes.  It is set in Victorian England and starts out with Otto Lunger (Sam Neill) taking a map and blowing up the cave in which it was found (which include his cohorts in crime as well as Will Charity (Michael Sheen) who seems to be chasing him).  Then cuts to Charles Mundi (Ioan Gruffudd) speaking on the acquisition of antiquities and their importance while teenage son Mariah (Aneurin Barnard) and younger brother wait through the interminable speech.  Enter Will Charity seemingly unscathed at first glance only to have him collapse and taken to Charles Mundi's office with Mrs. Mundi in attendance to help their dear friend Charity.  Charity warns them that Lunger has the map and that the Mundi's may not be safe.  So Mrs. Mundi immediately shuffles off her 2 boys back to the hotel with words of warning to trust no one.
Mariah tries to protect his younger brother who is soon captured by Lunger's henchmen.  Charity comes to Mariah's aide and gives him the history of his parents work with Charity as well as the sinister goals of Lunger and how Mariah can best try to find his brother.
I found this to be a good fast paced story that held my full attention.  The acting was good although I always seem to like the acting of Sheen, Neill, Headey and Gruffudd, but had not seen Barnard (Mariah) before and found him to be very good as well.  Barnard did look a little older than the 17 yr old Mariah he was playing but he did manage to pull it off fairly well.  I quite enjoyed seeing Sheen change characters throughout.
There was a point in the movie where there was use of a steel cable that didn't quite fit in Victorian times and one has to stretch the imagination with the workings of elevators that seem a bit modern.  But the movie is thoroughly captivating and enjoyable with a story that adults can appreciate while also suitable for young viewers.",1388102400,19,2010,4.573816155988858

8625550,2,B00GOHZV6Q,"One of the most inane movies I have ever watched.  Multiple plot holes, non sequiturs, crazy improbabilities, and simply foolish events and character actions.  Every 90 seconds I thought, ""Why did he do that?  Where did that come from?  I thought he was supposed to be working?""  I only made it halfway through.

What I did see was innocuous, relatively suitable for children over 7 or so : there was some blood from an unseen stabbing, a little overt violence -- shooting at people with a gun, some fighting -- a mummified skeletonish thing (much like a Halloween figure), and no smooching.  The production qualities are decent, the acting OK -- although a few accents are hard to fathom.",1517011200,,689,4.739495798319328
