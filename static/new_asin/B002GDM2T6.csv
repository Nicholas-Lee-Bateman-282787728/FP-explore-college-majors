3924696,4,B002GDM2T6,"The epitome of Marion Morrison's (John Wayne) western movies that marked him as an actor worthy of his status of ""STAR."" These Warner Brothers films are worthwhile to being viewed time and again. My favorite is ""The Searchers"" which really capture John Wayne's acting ability and should have earned him an Oscar.",1434240000,4,312,5.019230769230769
3924697,3,B002GDM2T6,"There are five movies in this collection but it looked rather useless to buy the collection. Any John Wayne fan worth his or her salt, would already owned the three movies in this collection. If they haven't, they are not really true John Wayne fans!!  Only ones that hasn't been released are Cahill and Train Robbers, might as well buy them separately. Cahill is one of Wayne's lesser westerns. But Train Robbers still show that John Wayne can carry a movie!!",1429920000,5,460,4.679012345679013
3924698,5,B002GDM2T6,"Some great WARNER BROS. John Wayne movies that look spectacular on Blu-ray.  Ignore the maroon who doesn't understand that ""The Alamo"" can't be a part of this set because it's owned by a different studio.",1428883200,28,204,4.828571428571428
3924699,1,B002GDM2T6,Everything was great till they wouldn't play in my blue ray player.... Then I had to pay to send them back...,1428537600,2,109,4.238095238095238
3924700,1,B002GDM2T6,"to leave out ""The Alamo"" from this blu ray line-up is a real sin. shame on you. i can only hope the uncut version of the film will be released by itself soon.",1428451200,2,158,3.8181818181818183
3924701,5,B002GDM2T6,Amazing what blu ray does to the older movies,1493596800,,45,4.111111111111111

3924703,1,B002GDM2T6,They don't work. I was afraid of this because they were made in the UK. How do i send these back and get my money back,1483228800,,118,3.576923076923077

3924706,1,B002GDM2T6,"This is NOT ""multipe format.""  This is Blu-Ray only.  ""Multiple format"" is very misleading - it will not work on a standard DVD player.",1454889600,2,135,4.583333333333333
3924707,4,B002GDM2T6,My sister loves John Wayne movies and is very happy with the set.  I am purchasing another one for grandpa.,1453161600,2,107,4.35
3924708,5,B002GDM2T6,"Love these John Wayne westerns and glad to finally have TRAIN ROBBERS and CAHILL on blu ray.  Sadly, Warner is becoming the master of the double dips--the other 3 titles in this set have been previously released on blu ray (although RIO BRAVO has been MIA of late due to rights issues for one of the supplements on the original disc).  Granted, they've made TRAIN and CAHILL available to buy as singles, but I would rather have a set that included CHISUM and THE SHOOTIST (Warner handles Paramount distribution now).

With only 1 WB Wayne western left to be released (CHISUM), I really don't understand why they didn't include it in this set!  Oh, well, I guess that's why they get paid the big bucks.",1436400000,8,701,4.584

8369715,1,B002GDM2T6,I am sure I would have been very satisfied with the movies if I were able to play them on my DVD player. I did not notice these dvds came from England until after I ordered them. I also did not know that dvds from England will not play in American Dvd players.,1518220800,,260,3.9245283018867925
