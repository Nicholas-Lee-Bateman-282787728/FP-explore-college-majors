8343686,5,B001UHN8CE,"Mitchell Hurwitz is the best TV writer ever, but every single show he creates is
1. On Fox
and 2. Canceled WAY too soon!
Hurwitz has created shows including Arrested Development, Running Wilde, and this show, Sit Down, Shut Up. Every show he's written is clever, hilarious, and original (And they all star Will Arnett). Sit Down, Shut Up is one of the greatest animated shows to be on television. It was very smart, which is probably why it was cancelled, because, just liked AD, the majority of viewing audiences were not smart enough to enjoy this show. Not only is the cast fantastic and extremely talented, the writing is great, and the cartoon characters on real-life backdrops added great visual appeal to each scene. Unfortunately, the show was forced to a halt after only 13 episodes, and I was devastated. So anyone who is a fan of Mitch Hurwitz, or has a sense of humor at all, needs to buy this DVD as soon as it is released. Or download the episodes digitally, because I promise you will like this show, unlike Fox did. Shame on you Fox. American Idol can run for 8 or 9 seasons (lost count because, oh yeah, it sucks), but you can't allow Mitchell's quality shows to run longer than one season. At least there were 3 for AD.

8343687,5,B001UHN8CE,I watched every episode of this show until it got cancelled. I LOVED it! I thought it was hysterical and clever and I looked forward to it every week. I hope the DVD will be released in the future; I would truly love to add this show to my collection.,1267833600,12,251,4.04
