420732,4,6302054095,"...and Capri looks the same! I visited Capri in May 2001, as part of a Southern Italy trip, and fell in love with the place. Just recently saw this film, and could not believe how little things have changed. It's all there...the chair lift, the funicular, the Blue Grotto, the vitality and the stunning natural beauty. Clark looks like a geezer next to Sophia, unfortunately (I longed to see Cary Grant in this role!), but Sophia shines. Of course, the true star of this film is Capri itself.",1004313600,14,492,4.6022727272727275
420733,4,6302054095,"I agree with a previous reviewer - this movie is exclusively for ones who love Italy , all things Italian, and especially Southern Italy  and also enjoy watching great Italian stars - Vittorio De Sica is also there as a lawyer.
A great comedy, with nice irony of American boorishness but happily ending in them (Clark Gable as an American) understanding being wrong.  Clark Gable has an alcohol problem at the time of shooting the movie and it shows.  I've always thought he in his role is excessively old for Sophia there, they could have found someone younger.  Nevertheless, the film is a pure delight, with aforementioned disclaimers.  I classify it as entertainment, not art, but it's a first-class comedy.",1003104000,24,711,4.891666666666667
420734,5,6302054095,"I lived in Naples for 2 years and just returned to the States 3 months ago -- I want to go back!  This movie is perfect if you're ""home"" sick or planning a trip to Italy.  It's funny how NOTHING has changed in Naples since this movie.  It is still a vital, gorgeous and amazing city.  And Ms. Loren is gorgeous, as always!",978825600,9,322,4.063492063492063
420735,4,6302054095,"I have watched this movie many times...mostly for the wonderful scenery and the way it captures so accurately the way of life and character of the people on Capri....how I wish I was back there! You can't go wrong with Sophia ...she hardly needs to act....she IS the part. Story gets a bit tame after several viewings.....but that,s OK....Just enjoy the fun!!",977184000,,359,4.806451612903226
420736,4,6302054095,"If you love Sophia Loren, beautiful balloon bouquets, wiseacre humour, and all things Italian, then rush out and buy this film.  Otherwise, pass on it.  The script is lousy, almost silly, Gable is desperately trying to  recapture his faded movie starhood, and what we have here is more  wonderfully romantic and sensual atmosphere than story - in sunny Italy  with stunning Sophia Loren and other Italian beauties falling in love.  She's never looked better!  And that laughter will be with you for weeks!  This movie really is more like a romantic travelogue than a true movie.  For anyone who longs for the carefree idyllic beauty of italy, this film  captures it.  Just be sure to overlook the hokey script.  As Gable said in  the film, ""I've grown to like all of the native products.""  And  so have I.",960508800,6,805,4.731884057971015

420809,5,6302054095,It Started in Naples is a delightful movie. I saw it on tv and knew I had to add it to my collection. It's too bad they couldn't have made more movies together. I loved it!,1454630400,,172,3.8055555555555554
420810,5,6302054095,"I walked into the living room and the TV was on but suddenly my wife, sitting near the remote, snapped it off as though it was something she didn't want me to see, her face nearly expressionless except for a gleam of worry in her eye, the sort of look one wears when ones keeping a secret.  But we are both New Narrative writers and usually there are no secrets between us!  When I picked up the remote and switched it to reverse, I could she that she was watching some kind of highly colored vintage melodrama set on the Island of Capri.  Eventually she broke down in giggles and admitted hysterically that she was watching Sophia Loren and Clark Gable in Melville Shavelsons It Started In Naples (1960).

This is really my kind of picture and not hers, so I must have infected her with rom-com fever!  Well, rewind it, Ill watch it with you, I offered, but she wouldnt hear of it, she was too caught up in the action.  She said she would just recap things for me.  Previously, on It Started in Naples, she began, and quickly running through how this little 8 year old boy was the center of a custody war not between two divorcing people (perhaps there was no divorce in Italy in 1960, we guessed), but between Sophia Loren, whose sister had married a bohemian American ex-pat calledwe never did find out what he was called, but he was the younger brother of important US corporation lawyer Clark Gable.  And her sister and his brother had perished in a Fiat crash, or perhaps the car had gone off the narrow twisty mountain roads above Capris beautiful blue watersleaving behind a son whom aunt Sophia Lorena second rate cabaret entertainer with little talent but a fabulous figurewas trying to bring up, when she thought of it.  Eventually they were going to get together, but not before a lot of neorealismo hijinx and a lot of vino and cheese and grapes went down, and sexy dancing and captivating photography.  Many on IMDB claim that this is their favorite movie of all time.  Well, for one thing, it is a blistering anti American satire of imperialist business and law practices, the whole Ugly American thing Clark Gable embodies.  This is harsh pseudo Billy Wilder stuff!  Its like A Foreign Affair with Loren in the Dietrich role, and Gable in the Jean Arthur role.  Gable is incredibly withered and shrunken, but still magnetic, and game for anything.  In this role its almost tragic that his American sophistication and wariness of being played almost loses him his chance to find the one boy he had never even known he wanted, his 8 year old self, half American, half pleasure-mad Italian.

The little boy is like nothing on earth Ive ever seen in the movies.  With long arms and legs, and tiny playsuits, his face often dirty, he gets drunk, sneaks cigarettes, just wants to have a good time in Capri.  His English is rusty, and we could barely make out what he was saying half the time, but hes learning American slang (Im a tough guy, see?) as fast as Gable can dish it out.  Often in his underweara weird Italian pair of Ur-Jockey shorts youd never find on an American boy--he stays out all night, steals trinkets and things he thinks his aunt might like, knows far too much about sin and gambling, and avoids the hated school house.  His mouth always running, his bare feet stirring up a continuous whirligig cloud of dust, like the old Roadrunner cartoons, or Pigpen from Peanuts.  Hes thoroughly criminal, like little Jackie Earle Haley from The Bad News Bears, or actually like a boy from an earlier Italian strain of cinema, like the boy in De Sicas Bicycle Thief.  De Sica is in the movie too, playing Gables lawyer, super tall and handsome and expansive and a double-crosser, like everyone else in this tourism-driven island.

Loren is gorgeous, but more slovenly than usual in her US films, often wearing one weird blue ensemble with green underpinnings that doesnt know if its a house dress or a cocktail dress.  Its like the producers forgot to buy her any more outfits.  This one factor allows he movie to go into overdrive, insisting on its status as neo-realistic, that she should keep wearing the same dress every day like an ordinary housewife of Italy.  And the sunny criminality of the boy (the child actor, Marietto, who actually was about 13 when he played the role), and De Sicas practiced vamping, its practically a potted history of postwar Italian cinema.  But in bright color, brighter than anything Visconti or Bava ever achieved.  Its like the cinematographers and set designers here were practicing for upcoming Jacques Demy movies, for not until The Umbrellas of Cherbourg would there be a movie where you really didn't care what was happening on the screen, everything was so luscious like flowers blooming before your eyes.  When Gable and Loren slip out of a motorboat and into the velvety waters of Capris Blue Grotto, part of your brain knows its not them, but you don't care, they're svelte silhouettes at play in all the moonlit waters of the earth.",1444003200,6,5002,4.652272727272727

I might have watched it now for about 5 to 6 times and it's never boring or monotonous -- it's always tons of fun and satisfying at the end.

Sophia is way too classy and the role does not fit her at all of being a cabaret dancer, terrible mom, and lazy. The actors are very forced, including her romance with Clark Gable. Who would believe Sophia and an older Clark would even go together? This is just the beginning of this film's troubles. It's ok, that is all.

I use a front projector, and on a large screen these films are wonderful...but, DVD soft.

Modern viewers may not appreciate it as much some of the language and expressions are out of date of course. Some of the scenes where it appears that Loren was overacting were actually how the director wanted it. The director wanted you to know she was putting on a show to try and fool Gable.  Gable turns in a very solid professional performance. The old actors made it look very natural.

421095,3,6302054095,"An American lawyer (Clark Gable) comes to Naples to settle the affairs of his deceased brother, only to learn he has an eight year old nephew being raised by an aunt (Sophia Loren), a local cabaret singer. Predictably, aunt and uncle disagree on how the child should be raised, and, just as predictably, fall in love.

The film tries to portray the Neopolitans as simple fun-loving people, contrasted with the serious, stuffy American lawyer, but it does not work for me. Clark Gable was 59 when the film was released; he moves stiffly and his face seems pudgy at times, while Sophia Loren was only 26 (and quite healthy). Therein lies the problem: the story is not a May-December romance, and the aging Gable is not convincing as a romantic partner for the young and lovely Sophia.

The real attractions are the location photography of Naples and Capri, and the wonderful Sophia Loren herself. Filmed in VistaVision, the scenery is spectacular on a large screen TV -- particularly the eerily-beautiful shots of Capri's Blue Grotto. Sophia Loren effortlessly portrays: a parade queen, slovenly housekeeper, caring aunt, cabaret singer, and a woman in love -- amply demonstrating why she was a super star.

This is not a great movie, but if you enjoy romantic comedies it is a pleasant way to spend an evening.",1219795200,3,1309,4.860986547085202
421096,3,6302054095,"""It Happened in Naples"" isn't great, but it's a solid product from 1960 Hollywood.  It has star power, a catchy tune (""Tu Vuo Fa L'Americano"") that is still being covered by new artists today, a romantic Italian setting, lots of gorgeous Technicolor, and a plot that won't strain anyone's intellect. It's certainly watchable, but it never rises to the level of magic.

Mike Hamilton (Clark Gable) is making his second trip to Naples.  The first time was with the Fifth Army in 1943.  Seventeen years later he has returned to settle the estate of his ne'er-do-well brother, Joe.  Since Joe was perpetually low on funds, Mike anticipates a quick trip - a brief meeting with the lawyer and then back to Philadelphia.  Mike is a no nonsense kind of guy.

It comes as a complete shock to Mike when the lawyer, Mario Vitale (Vittorio De Sica), informs him that his brother died in a boating accident along with his common law wife.  They left behind their eight year old son, Nando (Marietto), who has been living with his maternal aunt, Lucia Curcio (Sophia Loren), on the island of Capri.

Rather than taking the child away from his home and the aunt he knows and loves, Mike is content to leave Nando with Lucia.  He gives her money and promises that he will be sending monthly payments to help with the child's support.  Everyone is happy until Uncle Mike becomes a victim of Italian timetables and misses his boat back to the mainland.

Unable to sleep, Mike wanders into the city center for a cup of coffee at 1am.  To his amazement, there is little Nando passing out fliers to tourists.  Fliers promoting his aunt's scantily clad nightclub act.  Mike sends Nando home and goes to confront Lucia about their nephew's upbringing.  Fireworks, literal and figurative, abound in the ensuing battle for custody.

Marietto is adorable as the urchin who smokes, drinks wine, hangs out in nightclubs most of the night, whistles at passing young women, and refers to himself as ""one tough cookie.""

Clark Gable's character displays neither his trademark charm nor humor, instead he comes across as brusque and cold for most of the film. He runs hot and cold on Sophia, and seems to have a detached interest in making sure his orphaned nephew has a proper home and education. Mike Hamilton is a difficult character to like.

Sophia Loren was an absolutely gorgeous 25 year old when this was filmed.  She's equally at home cooking up huge pots of pasta and as the sexy nightclub singer with a warm heart and a fiery temper.  Her musical numbers scorch the screen.

Casting the young and beautiful Sophia Loren as Gable's love interest only serves to make the 58 year-old actor look old and tired in their shared scenes. Lack of chemistry between the stars is a lead weight in this movie.  The love story never really works.

The DVD video quality is quite good.  The print looks restored with bright, vivid color.  The soundtrack is sharp and clear.  There are no bonus or special features on the disc - only scene selection and optional English subtitles.

Clark Gable is a perfect co-star for Sophia Loren. I have loved her since
I was 16. The woman was and is not only gorgeous, she knows how to
expose raw emotions. This is a perfect comedy because she seems to have
so much fun with the part and makes us want to laugh along. Her laughter
is infectious. When she needs to be dramatic, as in the more intimate scenes with Clark Gable, she exposes her real feeling. Among her great movies-HOUSEBOAT; BLACK ORCHID; TWO WOMEN; SUNFLOWER (a beautiful
movie with music by Henry Mancini); MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE; YESTERDAY,
TODAY, AND TOMORROW. One of her scenes in SUNFLOWER is heartbreaking. Her dramas are as equally as good as her comedies. IT STARTED IN NAPLES
also stars a little boy named Marietto Paolo Carlini, whom I assume is
Italian also. I have never seen him since. His performance is touching
and will make you laugh and cry. The chemistry among these actors is
wonderful! If you like comedies, you will like this. The best thing

I go to Italy almost every year and it amazes me how much of the same comical misunderstanding between our 2 cultures still exists, although fortunately no one takes it very seriously. Yes, Clark Gable was too old to be very convincing as a romatic lead opposite gorgeous Sophia Loren, but he still does the self-important, workaholic ""ugly American"" role perfectly with great comic results, although he is still upstaged by the adorable Marietto & the great director Vittorio DeSica, a great comic actor in his own right. Of course, they are all upstaged by the island of Capri, shown off by that vibrant 1950s cinematographic style.

421144,4,6302054095,"IT STARTED IN NAPLES is a romantic comedy. A man on the eve of his wedding visits Italy to settle the estate of his departed brother and discovers an unexpected cigarette smoking, con artist, preteen son -- neglected by American standards -- entrusted to a woman who seems to lack parenting skills. Indifference about responsibility grows to a competition and even a custody battle. Fans of Loren are not disappointed as she tantalizes audiences with a few song and dance numbers. Clark Gable can't ignore Sophia Loren's beauty for long and the conclusion is inevitable.

With such magnanimous stars it is difficult to fault the movie. Loren was definitely at home in Italy and many of the scenes are breathtaking. Some of the dialog -- most often of the precocious little boy -- is in Italian. If you don't know the language, the lack of translation can make you feel important details are being missed. Perhaps this is to give viewers a sense of how Gable, an Americano, felt. The plot is not extremely original but if you like Gable, Loren, know Italian or want to see Italy you'll enjoy where it all started... in Naples, Italy.

Gable plays a stuffy Bostonian lawyer, in Naples to meet the young son of his dead brother.

As you might expect however, the charm of Capri soon works it's magic and the pair find love in the final reel.

Sunny funny romance.  This is probably one of Sophia's best pictures of the time.  As Lucia, a stunning uninhibited cabaret star, she gets to show off her seldom-utilised musical skills performing several numbers including ""(You Wanna Be) Americano"".  Though Loren and Gable are somewhat lacking in the chemistry department, the movie as a whole is lovely.

421147,5,6302054095,"This charming little romantic comedy directed by Melville Shavelson is one of the brightest spots in Sophia Loren's early Hollywood films. He wisely used Sophia's comic talents which were often wasted by American directors. Having worked with her in another early gem, ""Houseboat"" with Cary Grant, Shavelson was aware of what would make Sophia shine and here he showcases all of her many ample charms.

  The DVD is presented in a sharp and glittering print of the wonderful cinematography of Robert Surtees. One of the great camera men who's credits include 1962's ""Mutiny On The Bounty"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Raintree County"", and ""The Last Picture Show"". He captures breathtaking shots of cramped and teaming Naples and the expansive sunny vistas of Capri. In his hands this beautiful part of Italy becomes a lovely widescreen postcard that beckons the viewer into the story.

  The score by  Alessandro Cicognini (Indiscretion of an American Wife) and Carlo Savina is pure Italian gold and fits the comic proceedings perfectly. And the addition of the song Tu Vuo Fa L'Americano in Sophia's club act is marvelous. This popular Italian song of the 1950's resurfaced effectively in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". It is fun to see how Sophia interprets the song for the tourists on Capri.

  Clark Gable, cast as stodgy American Michael Hamilton is gruff and funny as he first battles and then falls for Sophia. He has many standout scenes with her and with child actor, Marietto. In particular is the scene where he and Sophia mix killer drinks for each other at the bar.

  Marietto as Sophia's nephew Nando is a little comic whirlwind. He is wonderful in his naturalness in his scenes with Loren. A skinny ball of ingenuity and energy he is particularly funny when he is trying to get his way with both Loren and Gable.

  The great Italian director Vittorio De Sica nearly runs off with the cameras, set and crew in his performance as Sophia's lawyer. He works so well with her, and why not, he was her director in ""Gold of Naples"", ""Two Women"" and the wonderful ""Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow.""  His speech in the courtroom scene is a standout.

  All this wonderful talent surrounds Sophia Loren in what is really her show. She is pure magic as Lucia Curcio, a woman of passionate love of life and family. She dominates the picture as well she should because it is her talent as an actress and her incredible beauty that brought her to this point in her career. Her comedic turns and use of Italian gestures turn this into a joyous romp for both her and the audience.
