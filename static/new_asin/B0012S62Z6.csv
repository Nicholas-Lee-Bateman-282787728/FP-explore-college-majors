8561165,5,B0012S62Z6,"It's too bad that Amazon didn't procure a better print of this 16mm film for copying because ""Shotgun Joe"" is probably the best portrait of a juvenile delinquent that I have ever seen. Joe is brilliant in his story telling, charming in his own way, but headed for a life of crime that will undoubtedly mean more incarceration and possibly an early demise. As one staff person at the high security reformatory where Joe currently resides puts it, ""...he needs help, because one day after he gets out of here someone is going to blow him away, a cop or someone else."" Another says, ""..he wants to lead a life of crime, he reads books about it, and how do you deal with someone who says 'well, some people pick being a doctor, some people pick being a lawyer, I pick being a criminal.'"" But as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that, in fact, it is not criminal behavior that got Joe in trouble, but a troubled relationship with his mother, who had him arrested after he hit her--a charge that Joe denies. It is obvious the mother feels he is better off in jail than ""running around stealing left and right.""  This is a brilliant psychological portrait of a career criminal in the making, both funny and depressing, much like ""Shotgun Joe"" himself.",1241740800,,1251,4.56
