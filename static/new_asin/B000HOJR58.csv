8140693,1,B000HOJR58,"If your expecting a blood filled multiple killing spree about the worlds famous dr jekell you badly mistaken! Never before has the story been based at a meducal hospital nor the personality changing drug been ecstasy! It's a stereo type teenage movie that's taken a great story and turned it into crap. Don,t bother see the original",1354665600,,332,4.842105263157895
8140694,4,B000HOJR58,"The movie came without its proper/original case which I disliked. The movie overall is good but i'm not willing to pay the extra shipping and handling for it as it isn't THAT great. Yet, this is by far the best version of Jekyll and Hyde if you're familiar with the story/movie.",1354233600,,278,4.470588235294118
8140695,1,B000HOJR58,"I am a huge fan of the old black and white ""thrillers"" of yesteryear. I loved the original Jekyll and Hyde. When this version came out a few years back, I thought it'd be good. I was sorely disappointed. It wasn't bad, it just left me wanting something, anything, a plot maybe. I was sorry I actually spent money on it. I gave it away at a garage sale.",1293667200,,352,4.115942028985507
8140696,2,B000HOJR58,"Jekyll+Hyde serves up a gritty, twenty first century reenvisioning of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel about good and evil.  Despite a lot of avant-garde cinematography, some decent acting, and a pretty kicking soundtrack, though, the film never quite makes it over the hump dividing the good from the mundane.  It doesn't help that the story has been done to death throughout the decades of cinematic history.

Personally, I don't think anyone named Jekyll should be admitted to medical school - to me, that's just common sense.  I don't think med students should be popping homemade pills all of the time, either, but that doesn't stop it from happening in this film.  Anyway, Henry Jekyll (Bryan Fisher) was admitted to med school, and he is dead set on engineering some kind of mood-altering drug based on Ecstasy.  Why?  I have no idea.  It's not the kind of research product that his professor can endorse, so Jekyll continues his work in secret.  Experimenting upon himself, he offers video updates describing the side effects and such from the increasingly larger samples of drug he is taking.  The major side effect is the personality change engendered by the drug, which begins turning Jekyll into Hyde.  You would think Jekyll would call the whole thing off after finding the bloody body of an unknown female in his bathtub, but by that point it's too late.  He's wholly dependent on his dangerous little pill, and he actually likes Hyde because Hyde has all of the strength and confidence that he lacks.

As members of his inner circle of friends begin to die in increasingly gruesome ways, Jekyll isolates himself more and more, even from his sort-of girlfriend Martha.  No one knows about Hyde, and the seemingly nonexistent local police obviously don't suspect him of committing the crimes.  Murder will out in the end, of course - as will bad movie-making.  I'm afraid Jekyll + Hyde makes no more than a small ripple in the ocean of this over-exploited genre.",1259366400,2,1983,4.892215568862276
8140697,2,B000HOJR58,"OK I saw a preview of this movie on a DVD and I thought, SEX, DRUGS, and MURDER !! Well ALLRIGHT!! BUT NO ! This movie is a PG 13 movie trying to pull off a R rating. There is drugs, a lot of super brainiac med students getting wasted on drugs only they can get of course. Our medical future is not looking too good according to this movie ! There is sex, two good and wild sex scenes and a lame sex scene which was supposed to be a climax, that just sucked bad, the actress even kept her top on, what type of sell was that. NEVER USE ACTRESSES WITH THAT NO NUDITY CLAUSE, PLEASE!! The murder, well you have to use your imagination the acts were never really shown, they were more like pyschotic blackouts and flashes, one minute they're standing the next minute they're bloody and crying. This is a medicore suspense thriller, with mid 20 something teen actors. That night vision stuff in the end of the movie didn't help either. It should have been more graphic and of course more nudity, jekyll and hyde is a great plot. A doctor with a split personality, that knows exactly how to kill you and dispose of the evidence. Just another bad adaptation.",1169164800,4,1151,4.308755760368664
8140698,3,B000HOJR58,"Yeah, that's right, I'm the first one to review the movie! HAH! Anywho. The movie's not bad. It's not great either. The movie is a modern interpretation of the Stevenson novel. It takes place with a bunch of med students (Dr. Jekyll is known as ""J""). Jekyll tries to alter personalities by manfucturing a drug derived from extacy. The side effects result in Hyde, Jekyll's alternate personality. There's no impressive transformation, which is a let down, but oh well. Hyde is simply a crazy, drug taking, sexually hungry, violent part of Jekyll. You sometimes even get confused about which personality is present.  A notable little piece of info that I found amusing was the use of characters' names from the novel in the movie.

Obviously, the movie wasn't released in theaters, but it's not bad, despite that reason. There's no need for briliant special effects, and the work is good. It doesn't look like a cheap amatuer movie like  a lot of straight to DVD movies do. It is well acted and the few effects it does contain are well done.

If you are a fan of the original novel or of the numerous adaptations that it spawned, this is one to check out. And maybe, if you're a fan of Requiem For a Dream (though I'm not), you might enjoy this film. Otherwise, there's not much there for ya.",1162684800,9,1290,4.595652173913043
