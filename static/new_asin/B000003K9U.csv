This was originally shown as a 2 hour special as the  introduction to Deep Space Nine season 4.  This was first aired on  September 30, 1995.
In my opinion, this was one of the best DS9  episodes ever.  Worf becomes DS9's Strategic Operations Officer.
The  Motion Picture Sound Editors nominated ""The Way of the Warrior, Part  II"" for their Golden Reel award for Excellence in Sound Editing for TV  Series or Movies.
There were a number of guest stars in this episode:  Penny Johnson as Kasidy Yates, Marc Alaimo as Gul Dukat, Robert O'Reilly as  Gowron, J.G. Hertzler as General Martok, Obi Ndefo as Drex, Christopher  Darga as Commander Kaybok, William Dennis Hunt as Huraga, Andrew Robinson  as Garak, Patricia Tallman as the Weapons Officer, Judi Durand as the  Station Computer Voice.",956793600,9,954,4.993630573248407
1180617,5,B000003K9U,"For those who love space battles, this 2-part episode has a good one.  A large Klingon fleet arives at DS9 for unknown reasons.  Sisko recruits the now ship-less Worf (the Enterprise-D having been destroyed in  ""Generations"") to help deal with the Klingons.  Worf learns of  the Klingon plans to invade Cardasia (sp) which the Federation does not  approve of.
Once the Klingons know for sure that Starfleet won't help  them, they invade anyway.  The treaty between the Klingons and the  Federation is gone and now the Klingons have their eyes on DS9.  In an  excellent space battle, we watch DS9 defend itself against a Klingon  armada.
If somehow you've not seen the episode, I won't say anymore.  This episode marked another upshift for the DS9 series with the  introduction of Worf to the show and the start of hostilities between the  Klingons and the Federation.",953942400,19,867,4.882758620689655
1180618,5,B000003K9U,"The introduction of Worf and the shocking withdrawl of the Klingon Empire from the Kittamar Accord make this the top DS9 episode.

7903076,3,B000003K9U,"The Way of the Warrior was a 90-minute episode that introduced Worf (Michael Dorn) from The Next Generation to Deep Space Nine.  For that alone, it feels pretty gimmicky.  The rest of the story focuses on growing hostilities between the Federation and the Klingons, which culminates to what it is, quite simply, one of the best battle scenes in Trek history.  The space battle is massive and epic, and the Klingon parties that board DS9 lead to thrilling phaser fights and exciting, very well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat.  This battle scene alone makes the episode stand out from the rest of the pack.",1046563200,2,607,4.98019801980198
7903077,5,B000003K9U,"DS9 started its fourth season in a big way with a two-hour episode heralding the addition of fan favorite Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn). ""The Way of the Warrior"" can stand up well against the bigger-budgeted theatrical offerings in the franchise. It features state-of-the art effects, an enthralling storyline, wonderful performances from all cast members, and a rousing Dennis McCarthy score.
Speaking of acting, no one other than Dorn can don the Klingon makeup. He embodies the character's ongoing inner struggle between his allegiances to the Federation and his Klingon roots. Other noteworthy acting accolades go to Andrew Robinson, as the enigmatic ""Garek"", Marc Alamo as ""Gul Dukat"" and the eye-popping, scene-stealing Robert O'Reilly as ""Gowron"".
The show, like its predecessor, ""Star Trek: the Next Generation"", began to ""feel its wings"" during the third season and would maintain its level of excellence for the remainder of its seven-year run.
""Warrior"" is one of the highlights of that time.",1046563200,,997,5.356687898089172

7903079,4,B000003K9U,"Episode title: The Way of the Warrior
Written by: Ira Steven Behr & Robert Hewitt Wolfe
Directed by: James L. Conway
""The Way of the Warrior"" is the ninety minute long fourth season opener for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, that introduces a new threat to the Federation: The Klingons (again . . .).
The Klingons are getting frustrated of the threat imposed by the Dominion and the situation escalates as they start to ignore political treaties when they begin conducting searches of civilian ships outside their claimed territory. At the same time they start to express unofficial distaste toward the Cardassians.
As negotiations with tthe Klingons deadlock, Sisko desides to bring a more capable negotiator to the picture. Our familiar Liutenant Commander Worf.
Worf soon discoveres that a secret plan is being executed by the Klingon forces to invade the Cardassians on the excuse of their government being supposedly infiltrated by the Dominion...
The episode isn't really an individual TV-movie, but clearly a big-picture episode dealing with the political aspects of the show. There's just one big problem with all this. There has been no set up for this episode whatsoever.
The Klingons have played only a minor role in the series before this particular episode, but the reasons behind the Klingons' actions have been present throughout the third season of the show. Yet, we are supposed to believe what this episode offers us.
Furthermore, the episode ruthlessly chances the whole direction of the show, just like the third season opener ""The Search"" did. Granted the Klingon situation is strongly connected to the Dominion threat, the theme of season three, but is more of a consequence of it, not an extention. This brakes the feeling of continuity disruptively.
And then there's Worf...
Worf is introduced almost comically, so coincidental his contribution is. The whole episode screams the overly apparent attempt to get TNG wievers interested of DS9. Things are there because the writers have just simply put them there, not because the story has any use of them.
Nevertheless, ""The Way of the Warrior"" works pretty well. The story is filled with action, but it doesn't rise to being the most important aspect of the story. And on top of that the action sequences aren't overly long, and are very well executed. The visual effects work well and James L. Conway does an adequate job with his directing, ensuring a highly entertaining ninety minutes of trek.
""The Way of the Warrior"" is a fun way of starting the fourth season of DS9, even if it might have had more substance and some earlier set up to make the story more interesting.",1016755200,,2643,4.981900452488688
7903080,4,B000003K9U,"DS9's stellar THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR falls just a touch short of being one of their finest outings and that's because of the formulaic approach applied to creating a story to bring Worf, the only Klingon in Starfleet, aboard the Deep Space Nine station.  It's only 2 parts Trek and 8 parts 'Star Wars,' with an amazing space battle occupying much of the second hour.
Michael Dorn, as usual, chews scenery as the oft-disowned Klingon warrior who has given his heart to Starfleet ... but by the end of the series run has returned to his homeworld of Kronos.
Interestingly enough, I learned at a Trek convention that Dorn was being written into DS9 not to stabilize plummeting ratings of the show but rather to send a wake-up call to Avery Brooks, the station's captain/commander.  According to Trek insiders, Brooks was making waves about wanting off the show b/c of the lack of socially-relevant stories, so Berman and company opted to bring in Dorn ... to show Brooks the light that, if he wanted to leave, they had a new station commander waiting in the wings.
Funny.  Brooks stayed, but the stories did grow more socially relevant in the last few seasons.",1011830400,5,1157,4.689655172413793
7903081,5,B000003K9U,"People will debate this for years to come, but in my opinion, the best Star Trek series ever started here... Deep Space Nine.
Worf (Michael Dorn) made his DS9 debut with this two-parter that chronicles the makings of a Federation/Klingon war. These two episodes helped to establish the tone of DS9 for the rest of it's run. As Worf melded into the group (rather than taking over the show... see Star Trek: Voyager, subcatagory - Seven of Nine).
Over the course of seven seasons, DS9 went from being the afterthought of the Star Trek universe to being the standard bearer. Well thought plotlines, and stories that had consequences made this worth the visit every week. There are weak episodes, and there are great episodes. Make sure you don't miss any.",970963200,7,752,4.792307692307692

There are quite  a few refrences to the Pilot episode so watch the two together and catch  them. Worf makes a stunning debut into the DS9 series and definitely added  a new dimention to the cast and added a whole new twist to the future story  lines. This is where it all started and is a must have for any collector.",968198400,2,440,4.190476190476191
7903083,5,B000003K9U,"First of all the covers for DS9 videos are terrible, the ones published in the UK are a lot better. This episode is a must-see for fans of science  fiction, it does what the Original Series would've wanted to bring to the  screen but couldn't afford it, Starfleet battling the Klingon's. The budget  was obviously increased in this mega-action-packed doulbe episode that  introduces Worf to Deep Space Nine as a war between the Klingon's and the  Cardassian's is inevitable and Starfleet is caught in the middle. The  brilliant battle scenes have been stolen from this episode so many times  and placed in future episodes which is kinda annoying, but a solid script  and guest appearances by Gul Dukat, Garak, Martok and Gowron make this a  must-see classic that represents DS9 in all it's glory.",966729600,3,796,4.880597014925373

7903085,5,B000003K9U,"Are ""lovable"" Klingon friend from The Next Generation joins the crew of Deep Space Nine.
The Federation is in a delicate situation with both the Cardassian Union and the Klingon Empire.  The Klingons, allies of  the Federation, want to wipe out the Cardassians but the Federation won't  have it.  That will fall into the plans of the powerful Dominion who wants  to see all their opponents wipe each other out.  It makes it easier for  them to take over, ya see.
Captain Sisko has a problem.  And, he figures,  that the best way to deal with Klingons is to get help from a Klingon.  Enter Lt. Commander Worf.
I love how Worf interacts with the other  characters on DS9.  He's a man who never has fit in anywhere he's ever  gone.  He finally felt as if he had a home on the Enterprise but the ship  was destroyed several months prior to his arrival on DS9.  Worf is the  ultimate outcast in the Star Trek universe and I really feel for this guy  as he tries to reason and fit in with the Klingons while representing  Federation interests.  It's no easy task but, even though Worf partially  fails, he finds a home.  It's a place he does not fit into (even though DS9  harbors it's share of outcasts) but that's what great drama is about:  Conflict.
Worf was a very welcome addition to Deep Space Nine.  His  interaction with all the characters, from Sisko and Dax to O'Brien and Odo,  is a welcome change of pace for DS9 as this excellent series embarks on  it's most exciting season yet.",962236800,3,1487,4.4275092936802976
