3511861,5,B001CF86OO,"this series was amazing from the beginning to the end. Love,romance, comedy and little drama all rolled up it one. Anyone who watches this will not be disappointed. It's about this single young girl who has kept her purity and intends to do so until she finds that special one. However, since a good man seems to be hard to find, she is presented with other options that takes her on an adventure towards real love, the road of possibility to fulfilling her dreams and genuine friendship. Please take a look and enjoy",1234224000,2,517,4.56989247311828
3511862,4,B001CF86OO,"I have been a huge fan of Zettai Kareshi since the first volume of the manga appeared in Japan, and was ecstatic when I discovered that it would be made into a drama. When I finally watched it, I was pleased...but also somewhat disappointed. I would have loved for the plot and characters to at least resemble the manga more. All that remained in tact was the names, but roles were switched, and the plot morphed. I know very little Japanese, so subtitles for me were a must when watching this. The first disc's subtitles were excellent, but the second disc was poorly subtitled to the point that I had NO idea what they were trying to say. It was like: ""Tengse how make I to Chitjou happiest"" and I would have to mentally decipher what that could possibly mean. Those matters aside, I give this movie a 4/5 stars.",1225584000,11,814,4.433333333333334
3511863,5,B001CF86OO,"Bought this series of 11 episodes on a lark. basically it's about a robotics company that sells a slightly naive,extremely kawaii and very funny Saki Aibu an Ideal boyfriend (love robot). She is loaned the robot for testing and is tricked by the designers into buying it. After awhile she sees it as more than a pleasure appliance and it starts to act more than a preprogrammed robot, it develops true feelings. Mokomichi Hayami acts like a corny robot at first then smooths his performance out to the point that sometimes you forget he's a robot. The special effects are minimal but adequate as this is a drama and not a sci-fi series. The series goes through building relationships between various persons, achieving dreams or work goals (typical japanese) and seeing the humor and drama in such things. Acting and production are good on all points, as is usual in a jdrama subtitles get a little messy on the last two episodes. Saki Aibu is outstanding, this is one of her first jdramas and she could do no wrong in her performance, she had me rolling on the floor laughing till it hurt. Recommend for any and all Jdrama fans or anybody that likes anything Japanese.",1292198400,,1169,4.679611650485437
3511864,5,B001CF86OO,"After watching ""A Litre of Tears"" i knew i was going to get into watching more j-dramas and i heard about ""Absolute Boyfriend"" and thought i would give it a shot and once again I wasn't disappointed. The characters were played very well (even though i never saw or read the manga editions), i will buy me a copy and send one to my brother for his birthday next month. Highly recommend it.",1289520000,,388,4.328767123287672
3511865,3,B001CF86OO,"I read the original manga, and I have to say that I enjoyed the dvd story version a little more.  Instead of being based on teenagers, the characters are all working adults, which makes more sense as to why the female lead has a lover doll in her possession in the first place!  The silly events that took place in the manga were replaced by believable story arcs instead.  I think that Mizushima Hiro , the main male character, was absolutely charming and adorable; he also played a dorm lead role in Hanazaraki no Kimitache but has the ""playboy"" role down like a pro.  The series itself was pretty short and the drama was light comparaed to other romance dramas but was enjoyable all the same.",1285718400,,695,4.492063492063492
3511866,4,B001CF86OO,"The show is really funny. The dynamic between the main characters is great. The characters themselves are quirky but believable - at least the main ones. I loved the dorm head, Ikeda Mitsuru, and the student council president, Shinobu Tezuka.

The only down side is that the english subs are not very good. The text is not very clear and in red. The translation is word for word I think so sometimes it doesn't make complete sense. There are places with misssing words from the english phrasing or the word order is jumbled in english. The biggest gripe for me was that the names were not correct. If you don't mind that - or don't need the subs - this is well worth it to see.",1274486400,2,677,4.373015873015873
3511867,1,B001CF86OO,"I haven't purchased this product, but from the reviews that I have seen, this is an illegal bootleg copy of Maou. English subs that are not up to par are a flashing sign that this is an illegal copy. Another big sign is that it's being sold for just 16 bucks. Even in Japan its at least $150 (in US currency. In yen its over 15000).
This is a truly incredible drama and the acting of Ohno Satoshi and Ikuta Toma is beyond what I could have imagined. I loved this drama and I encourage everyone to get a LEGAL copy of this that will help support such great actors.
So, I rate the product 1 star, but the drama itself is 5 stars.",1269820800,4,627,4.064516129032258
3511868,5,B001CF86OO,"Drama trs intense, trs sombre, d'une grande force dramatique, et encore une fois mention spciale au gnial Ikuta Toma, magnifique.",1268956800,,129,5.5
3511869,4,B001CF86OO,"I started watching this drama on an online site and it didn't have the complete series, so I had to buy it because the show was so charming. I loved it. I like the opening them Tada Arigatou by Monkey Majik and the show is great. It's about a girl that wants to be a ""sweets"" chef and she gets taught by one of the greatest. She has to go through a lot of life lessons but she understands the importance of how much love and respect has to go into the food she is making for the customers to really love and appreciate the food they eat. I love the girl that plays Ando Natsu. She is a great actress and her smile is so warm. If you like food dramas and dramas for the heart, then this is the drama for you.",1266192000,,707,3.9166666666666665
3511870,4,B001CF86OO,"The first disc for this product is great (Episodes 1-6).  The subtitles are very good and only have minor, if any, errors.  However, when you get to the second disc, the subtitles are pretty bad (Episodes 7-11).  This is a problem that many Japanese drama translations have, which can be very frustrating for English-speaking viewers.  If you understand some Japanese, this should not be too much of a problem for you.  I was able to figure out most of what was going on by listening to what the actors were saying and deciphering the poor English subtitles.  I bought an original ""Maou"" box set on eBay, and I use this one and that one together when I watch this drama with my friends (Disc 1 one of this one has slightly better subtitles, but the quality of later episodes from the eBay one is far better).

I would not say ""no"" to buying this product, but I think that you should take into consideration how necessary the English subtitles are for you.  If you don't really need them, you should be fine.  I you need them, this may not be for you.",1264896000,,1050,4.427083333333333

3511872,5,B001CF86OO,"I watched this drama online long before I ordered it, and I was in love with it from episode one. It's such a happy drama, for the most part anyway. The story line really tore me apart, in a good way. I wasn't sure which one of Riko's suitors I was rooting for more, but whoever it was going to be, the audience could feel happy with her choice. Overall, wonderful story line. I could watch it a million times.",1260230400,,410,4.1375
3511883,4,B001CF86OO,It works. The case is really nice and fancy. I think the price was really good. Got it as a gift and they loved it.,1250467200,,115,3.64

3511885,5,B001CF86OO,"This is the first japanese drama I've seen and it was great!  And although it wasn't exactly like the manga (which by the way, you must read as it is absolutely charming, no pun intended) this drama version did capture the essence of the story.  Unfortunately, for some reason, the subtitle translation in English for the last two episode was a little messed up, so I really had to pay attention to what was happening so not to miss the story line.  But all in all, if you are a hopefull romantic, this drama is one of the top best.",1245110400,2,532,4.3
3511886,3,B001CF86OO,"I bought this drama without having seen any episodes, and I absolutely loved it. Who knew Ohno-kun could be so sinister? The subs were great for the first disc, but the second disc was pretty bad. They switched to the Chinese names, and it was very difficult to even understand what was happening during the dialog scenes. I ended up finding an English transcript of the last few episodes and using that. Definitely cut back on my enjoyment of the drama.",1245024000,3,454,4.617283950617284

3511888,5,B001CF86OO,"There are many deeper lessons throughout these series that are well taught. The Coach is very effective with his teaching both on and off the field.  This is a must if you enjoy sports drama. It might be a little strong in some aspects if you're not on the tough side.  We loved it.  Despite the hard times during each show, it's very inspirational.",1241740800,3,349,4.421875
3511889,4,B001CF86OO,this is a very good seires you can watch it many times. the last episodes texting is really bad.,1240963200,,96,4.105263157894737
3511890,3,B001CF86OO,"So, why is that I'm giving one of the best tv show I've ever seen 3 stars?  There is a glitch with the sub-titling beginning with episode 9. If you understand Japanese, then this is a 5 rating.  I don't know about the sub-titles in Chinese.  With episode 9, all the characters get Chinese names, which isn't much of a problem since by that time, all the major characters are established.  But the problem is that many times, the English is broken, or just plain inaccurate. I'm better off than most since I understand some Japanese, but I had to watch episode 9 three or four times to get the jist of what was happening.  Episode 10 and 11 are a little more straight-forward, but I had to watch a second time to get a better understanding.

 That said, when I saw the first episode, I thought it was really hokey, but there was something about it that kept me watching.  By episode 3, I was hooked.  Superficially, I'll describe the series as ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" meets the ""Bad News Bears,"" but it is much deeper.  Although much of the plot and dialogue is over the top (after all, it is based on a manga(Japanese comic book), I found this 11 episode series to be inspirational, heart-warming and really emotional.  So, I really didn't mind watching episode 9 over and over again, and even now, I'll pick a random episode to watch.

The acting is good throughout, and there is a definite chemistry between the actors, which is very important for this drama because it is all about friendship, believing in oneself, and the trust which should be between students and their teacher.

 I feel bad about dropping the ratings by two stars over the English sub-titles but, the sub-titles can make or break the enjoyment because it comes just as the series sets up the conclusion.  If you love the show up to that point, you won't mind watching the episodes over and over again, but if you're not in love with it, then you'll probably get frustrated and won't complete the series.",1240876800,5,1976,4.5423728813559325

3511892,5,B001CF86OO,"this series is one of reconciliation of family,the dedication of true friendship, and how to get over ones self to help another succeed.  A young man is presented with the task of taking care of his neice that he didn't even know he had through a sister who he has disowned many year ago. All while trying to fulfill his own dreams of becoming a writer.

8287398,3,B001CF86OO,"The movie is base on the premiss that if you change the individuals enviroment then you will get diffrent result.  This reminds me of ""nature vs nurture.""

You cant even understand whats happening. They don't even say there names right they call the main girl ""pear clothing child"" and one of the main guys ""long room"" and the main girls friend ""North America and Canada"". The sentences if you can call them that have no meaning and are incomplete. In one part i cant tell their saying exscuse me but the sub said ""you will pass"".

8287400,3,B001CF86OO,"Ando Natsu is a very cute show, but regarding the product itself, I am rather disappointed with the ""English translation."" I know enough Japanese not to have to rely on the subtitles, but I got a copy of this show because I wanted to be able to share it with friends who do not know Japanese. It appears that the translation was done in a very literal style by a Chinese speaking translator with a limited grasp of English. Conversations are hard to follow, and all people and place names seem to be presented as Chinese readings to their Japanese kanji characters. With understanding a struggle, it will be difficult to feel the heart of these beautiful stories.",1327190400,,663,4.627118644067797
8287401,1,B001CF86OO,"The poor subtitles/translations issue that people keep commenting on is because this is a bootleg DVD. As of yet no J-dramas have been licensed for US release, ever. Any drama boxset that is both: A) ""All region"" (as opposed to R1 for North America, etc.); and B) both Chinese and English subtitled is almost assuredly a bootleg. Don't waste your money!

P.S. I actually like this drama otherwise-- I just hate it when people make money selling illegal copies.",1315526400,,460,4.822784810126582
8287402,2,B001CF86OO,"Seigi No Mikat is a short TV series told from the perspective of 15 year Yoko who writes a blog about the exploits of her older sister Makiko, a beautiful and smart but completely calculating self-absorbed devilish ""mean girl"". Makiko lives at home with Yoko and their indulgent parents who treat Makiko like a princess. Makiko works at a government agency after having graduated from a prestigious university while Yoko has suffered torment and indignities at the hands of her older sister for years and is treated like a slave or personal servant. No one believes poor Yoko who is continually amazed that no one can see her sister for the demon she really is because, ironically, Makiko's cruelty often turns to a blessing for her victims. Yoko finally decides the only way to end the torment is to sacrifice another by finding a man who will marry her sister.

The series has wit, sparkling writing and great chemistry and, I have to say, is one of the funniest I can recall. The actresses playing Yoko and Makiko play their parts to perfection though Makiko is often played as a caricature for effect (not too surprising since the story is being told from Yoko's point of view) but the series never quite becomes completely outlandish. Unlike typical US sitcoms, the story actually goes somewhere which helps keep things fresh and lively as Yoko tries to help her sister win the heart of a handsome man from a wealthy family.

The DVD set has very nice video, sound and packaging. The English subtitles are very well done except for an issue I'll mention in a moment. I should mention that the subtitles appear to have originated with a fan-subbing group who probably weren't asked for permission or paid any compensation which makes me question the legitimacy of this release. A big problem for the English speaking viewer is that subtitle translations are very well done UNTIL the last few episodes when they suddenly become completely incoherent gibberish written by someone with a poor command of English. If you need to see this translated into English, you won't be able follow the final few episodes very well at all.

In summary, while I would recommend this series highly giving it 5 stars for the original show, I have to give it two stars for this particular release for English-only speakers who won't be able to fully enjoy the last few episodes.",1310342400,2,2363,4.772616136919315
8287403,5,B001CF86OO,"I first watched this online, and liked it well enough to purchase it from a site (not a personal dealer or ""home"" site) and had absolutely NO complaints about it.  The subs were almost verbatim of what the online subbers (big Ohno and/or Toma fans who spoke English and Japanese fluently) had put up, so I would suspect the disc I purchased was a legal copy. I paid $35.00 (shipping and postage was extra) but it was well worth the cost and waiting three weeks to get.

For anyone who would like to ""get into""  Asian dramas, this is a good beginning.  I have recommended it to many persons, and I still recommend it.  As a huge Arashi fan, I was interested to see what Satoshi Ohno could do as a stand alone actor, away from the other members of the band.  He didn't disappoint me.  Knowing his personality, and watching this drama gives one a good insight to the level of his talent.

The actual storyline was good, the acting was good, and the subbing for the disc I purchased were accurate.  My biggest reccomendation would be to make sure you are purchasing from a reputable dealer and not from a single seller who probably bought it, was unhappy with the sub job and now wants to recoup some money.",1310256000,,1203,4.407239819004525
8287404,5,B001CF86OO,"A friend of mine introduced me to this drama a few years ago. I didn't know much about it nor did I read the graphic novel that its based upon, but I found myself hooked after the first episode to the point where I stayed up late on some nights to watch it. I would want to go to sleep but always tempted to know what would happen next because every episode has some sort of exciting cliff hanger.

The story revolves around a young lady named Riiko, a secretary at a dessert company who has very poor luck with men. Her bad taste alway lead to the men using and dumping her. Until one day she was approached by an inventor, testing a out a robot built for ""human relationships"". Riiko volunteers for the study one day finds Night the robot on her door steps. Initially, Riiko treats Night as nothing more than a burden, while he behaves in the way his ""boyfriend program"" tells him to. But over time, Night's feelings and actions go beyond programming and his love for Riiko become strong, and human. They have to battle many hardships and tests along the way, which makes for very good storytelling!

This drama is funny, witty, absolutely romantic, honest, heartbreaking, and just plain amazing! I've seen a few dramas from various Asian countries, and this one, by far, is my hands down favorite one. I'd recommend this for die-hard Japanese drama fans as well as the romantics. This drama will make you believe that love can create miracles!",1303516800,,1446,4.53639846743295
8287405,5,B001CF86OO,"This series has the proper subtitles if you watch it on a ordinary DVD on the television instead of watching it on a computer.  The computer will try and give a literal translation which makes no sense.  However, the subtitles are correct on the common DVD player that will allow the subtitles that are encoded into the DVD without confusing anybody.
This is a great series and it has good subtitles",1294444800,,399,4.605633802816901
