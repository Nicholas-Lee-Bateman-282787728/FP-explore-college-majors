3417726,5,B0018M6J9U,"I have seen High School Musical and High School Musical 2, and I have to say that The American Mall is so much better then High School Musical. I'm 21 and even though this movie can't decide if it wants to be a kids musical or an adult musical I found it amazing!

Its a remindes me of Rent in some ways as the songs go. Then they hit you with some songs that seem to come from High School musical's way. The singing is amazing in the movie. They was they sing together gives me chills. I like all 10 songs that make thier home in this moive.

I don't even like all the songs in High School Musical, That ""Get Your Head In the Game"" always gets skipped when seeing the movie. But found all the songs in American Mall amazing and not overdone like the songs in High School Musical. Its nice to see a musical can be made for the older crowd then the little 13 year old kids. With songs that sound more rock band then gay keyboard sounds of HSM.

Songs that stand out are ""Dreaming Wide Awake"", ""A Little Bit Of Heart Somewhere"", ""Survivor"", ""Sorry's Not Enough"" & the title song, ""Get Your Rock On""

If you do not like this musical then something must be wrong with you. The story is good, the music is amazing, and gets better with every time you see the movie.

I think over time this movie will outshine High School Musical and I feel that an Americn Mall 2 will be coming soon. Lets just hope its as good as the first one. We all saw how bad High School Musical 2 was and I don't have much hope for HSM3.

Just you wait this movies popularity IS GROWING!!",1218585600,3,1557,4.122112211221122
3417727,5,B0018M6J9U,How old are you Cassidy??? this was a great movie. The songs were great and deffinately appealed more to an older crowd. I as a mom of a 10 year old (who was not allowed to watch) loved this movie. The music was great and the story was too,1218499200,3,239,3.8979591836734695
3417728,1,B0018M6J9U,"*Note: This was originally written as a review on iTunes, where the overwhelmingly large number of 5-star reviews were just too much to sit idly by.*

Yes, I am 21, but High School Musical (and especially it's successor) was a movie with a lot of heart, with a soundtrack full of catchy replayable tunes.  They say this is for the ""older"" crowed, that HSM is too ""tween"" and that TAM is edgier and more mature - well that ain't true.  Unlike High School Musical's, these songs are empty and hollow, the most generic music I've heard in a very long while.  I didn't think vocals could get worse than Hudgens' (who actually improved on the second soundtrack) but Nina Dobrev's - and the rest of the cast for that matter - is nothing but horrid, synthesized drivel.  And there's no one with anywhere close to the vocal prowess of Lucas Grabeel on this album anywhere.  It's a shame the only one with apparent true vocal talent, Neil Haskell, only got 3 stanzas of solo music in the entire score.

As for the movie itself, it's highly contrived, and really, really boring.  Nina Dobrev's acting is no better than it is on Degrassi - which is horrible (her acting, not the show), for those not with the program.  The musical numbers have horrible segways, coming from out of nowhere, and ""Survivor"" is a complete music-video of a mess.  The cinematography and editing are admitably decent, but is that really important when everything else is screwed up so horribly wrong?  The entire ensemble cast is bland, and although I love So You Think You Can Dance's Neil Haskell, his sidekick role could never be good enough to hold me to a movie this bad.  Speaking of So You Think You Can Dance, it's sad that the only reason I was able to wade through the film was catching tiny glimpses here and there of dancers who had been on the show this season (Matt, Thayne, Gev, Kelli, Bayli (Kelli's sister, also Bonnie Story's daughter)).  For even the most diehard fans of the dance reality show, it's not worth it.  Trust me.

Comparing ""Work It Out"" to ""At The Mall"" (whose lyrics go something like ""at the mall, ooooh at the mall"") or ""Gotta Go My Own Way"" to ""A Little Bit of Heart Somewhere"" (hey sugar hey sugar hey, don't care what you say..."") seems like no contest.  Yet there's hundreds of people who attest that this is better than High School Musical.  Everyone has their own opinions and prefrences, but when something so blatantly bland and horrible is said to be better than something with a lot of heart, I get pretty darn confused.  Did we watch the same film?  Are we reviewing the same thing here?",1218499200,8,2601,4.542918454935623
3417729,5,B0018M6J9U,Was expecting this to be worse then what it was. I was pleased to see the movie wasn't scratched the case was in tack and that i was able to get it at such a steal,1406851200,,163,3.5555555555555554
3417730,5,B0018M6J9U,Another clean movie that I really enjoyed.  I like stories that show where people can move onto better things and not let someone hold them down.,1400284800,,145,4.576923076923077
3417731,4,B0018M6J9U,"I of course thought this was just a rip off of High School Musical, but it interested me because I saw the commercial for it on MTV. I bought it long ago and I've worn it out and scratched it that I must purchase another and decided I would leave a review.
I love musicals and this one was okay. In my personal opinion, not all actors or actresses should sing. It just seems a bit much when they all want to be a triple threat, but this was out before she became a big star from Vampire Diaries. Some songs were better than others, I especially love...I believe it's called Stronger with all the females just killin' it in those awesome boots. There were a few others, but the real reason that I absolutely adore this movie is for the commentaries.
I am a nerdy geek girl that loved special features and one of my favorite things is bloopers and the other is commentaries. It's a chance to hear how everyone interacts with each other and usually you learn something that happened behind the scenes that you won't ever find out about anywhere else. I do enjoy the commentary with the main cast, but my favorite one is actually with the director and the guys who played the janitors.
I've watched the movie without the commentary three times but the other times were with that commentary. It's funny and you hear how they worked together, what songs they liked, how they learned a dance routine that they didn't even perform in, and many other things. But I digress.
The special features also have a music video from Wade Allain Marcus and David Baum. It's a really good song which also has Nina Dobrev.
Yes the movie is good however it can get a little campy at times, but I really do enjoy for the commentary. So I say if you are like me and enjoy things like that, then go for it. Buy the movie. Watch it. Then commentary time.
Enjoy.",1371772800,,1835,4.368421052631579
3417732,5,B0018M6J9U,If you love musicals you will love this one. I loved most of the songs except one or two. The songs are catchy and the plot was great.,1353456000,,134,3.8214285714285716
3417733,4,B0018M6J9U,"The American Mall is a fun, upbeat, entertaining movie. It's about a young woman named Ally (Nina Dobrev from ""The Vampire Diaries"") she is a wonderful singer and songwriter. She meets a young man named Joey (Rob Mayes) who is working as a janitor at the mall, but also has a band. They get close and connect through Ally's music. Things get interesting when the spoiled daughter of the mall owner, Madison (Autumn Reeser), decides she wants Joey for herself. She stops at nothing to get him. Not caring who she hurts, she starts in on Ally's mom who owns a music store in the mall. I found this movie kinda typical. Boy gets girl, does something stupid and loses girl, then gets girl back by the end of the movie.

This DVD comes with Special Features:
Director Commentary Featuring The Janitors
Cast Commentary
Deleted Scenes
Bloopers
Learn To Dance With Bonnie(At The Mall And Don't Hold Back)

3417734,3,B0018M6J9U,"It's basically after school special meets musical.  Now I admit that means I'm not it's target audience but it was cheap & I like Nina Dobrev.  With her in the lead role it was good enough to hold my interest so I give it a 4 on that level.  Without that it was merely okay IMO which is a 3 so you get an averaged out 3.5.  To put it in perspective, I think Hellcats on TV is far better scripted & better acted roughly in this target audience group.  So nothing earth shattering here but a decent way to pass an hour or so esp. if you like Nina Dobrev.

My biggest complaint are the commercials you CAN'T fast forward of bypass.  Normally this is bad enough but these commercials are uterly stupid including Jackass & other stuff that isn't nearly as positive as the movie.  I mean you have how to be annoying advertisements on a be a good person movie.  It just seems like the ads don't match at all to me which makes it doubly annoying.  I say put the movie in the DVD, walk away & do something else for 5-10 minutes to avoid watching the stupidity & then come back to enjoy the movie.",1311811200,,1087,4.133333333333334
3417735,3,B0018M6J9U,"Ever since Fame, it seems every year Hollywood has attempted to come up with a teenage musical worse than the previous year. American Mall is no exception, unless you just want a story with some good old fashion lip syncing fun. Ally is the daughter of a women who owns an unsuccessful mall music store. Mom used to have dreams of being a star, but when they never happened, she made her daughter study business and refuses to let herself live her life through her daughter as most parents would. While playing her music at the mall she meets a teenage janitor boy (Joey) who is ""in tune"" with her music. During a three minute lip syncing musical number their souls entwine. However there is the pure evil mall daughter who feels rejection from her father so she takes it out on poor Ally. In an almost Faustian manner, she steals Joey away from Ally by making him her model poster boy.

To pour salt in the wound she also steals her music to promote her store (PLOT SPOILER, if there is such a thing for this teenage love story). Eventually Joey comes to his senses and shuns fame, fortune, and a beautiful rich girl for Ally his soul mate. All ends well with everyone in perfect lip sync for the finale. Nina Dobrev at times comes across as another Miley Cyrus, while at other times she is more like Anne Faris. If you are a young teen or tween girl, this is a 10 star movie for you Cinderella. Us guys will just stomach it while you enjoy the bejesus out of it.

No nudity, no sex, no bad language, just some minor sexual innuendos such as ""Is he a good kisser and how big are his hands?"" Yawn.",1285372800,,1597,4.32
3417736,4,B0018M6J9U,"The television release of this musical was over-shadowed by multiple programs released on the same night and MTV did not place enough strength behind the release date. The result is that this one did not get the attention it deserved was hit with poor viewer ratings.
The film is loaded with fun musical moments. The production team included the people involved with the ""High School Musical"" flicks so it was bound to have some shining moments.
But it was a flop on the tube.
Which brings me to;
Why buy the DVD? If not for any other reason: Yassmin Alers.
The kids put on a great show but then suddenly we realize what PRO means when Alers hits the stage for the finale.
If they create a sequel (the set-up for one is there), they need to give this gal more screen time and more musical moments.",1276387200,,797,4.428571428571429
3417737,4,B0018M6J9U,"I found myself liking this sort of Partridge Family manufactured

Nina Dobrev is sort of the perfect modern x generation girl:
manufactured for Sterio HDTV: beautiful voice and a fashion manikin body.
The rich mall owner's daughter (Autumn Reeser)  is the villain who wants to take the boy friend away.

3417744,4,B0018M6J9U,"I like the High School Musical productions, especially their choreography and the lead actor/actress. That being said, ""The American Mall"" is funnier, sexier, and has a much stronger soundtrack top to bottom. Nina Dobrev is absolutely magnetic as Ally, and Autumn Reeser's portrayal of Madison. (the period is for extra chic) is wicked excellent. The film has a natural look, but uses certain fantastical musical pieces to explore the characters' inner emotions. These fantasy elements work very well, especially ""Survivor"".

The film explores the key decisions people need to consider right after they leave high school. Issues of dreams, reality, faith, hope, trust, money, justice, forgiveness all come into play. The movie keeps it real, despite the fantasy departures), and works effectively because of that approach.",1220572800,,822,5.523809523809524
3417745,4,B0018M6J9U,"Ally has promised her Mom that she will take up a bid from Ohio State to become an accountant, but on the sly she's applied to the New England Conservatory of Music.  This paints Ally as something of a sneak, a character flaw only underlined when we see her sneaking into the Mall after hours to play the big grand piano and work on her heartfelt tunes.

You'd think Mom would understand, for she too was a singer-songwriter twenty years ago, but her one single eluded thc charts and she got bitter, and now runs a floundering music store at the huge Huxley Mall, teaching kids the piano and remembering her past.  She just doesn't want to see Ally making the same mistakes she did.

Soon a ""Phantom of the Opera"" element comes into play as we see a gloved hand pullling scraps of music paper out of the trash can under the piano.  Someone is saving Ally's abortive attempts at penning a pop song, and pinning them to a wall backstage at the Opera House--I mean, at the Mall.  When it turns out to be Joey, the janitor, I was a little disappointed.  Joey, like Ally's mother, is another failed musician whose dreams went up in smoke when his trust in another led to the theft of his band's guitars, amps, mikes, speakers and drums.

Now the four janitors play pots and mops in their closet, in a spirited number, and soon Ally and Joey are writing songs together on the roof of the Mall, while a jealous and malignant force, young Madison Huxley, played by Autumn Reeser with full Anne Baxter evil, decides to destroy them both as a way to getting her father to admire her.  This part did seem like CAMP ROCK, as though young should feel sorry for the mean girls since they just want the approval of an absent and uncaring parent.

Didn't you think it was going to turn out that, twenty years before, Mr. Huxley and Ally's mom had been lovers and that it was going to turn out that Madison and Ally were sisters?  Some passable pop numbers and some OK acting make this one a slightly more cynical and sophisticated take on HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but I'm getting tired of shows urging me to hold on to my dreams and have faith in myself, surely they could have gone for a little bit more social significance than having the poor Asian boy dress up as a hot dog and never discover if he was gay or straight.",1219795200,,2303,4.370023419203747

3417748,5,B0018M6J9U,"I am a movie goer, I'm a 21 year old guy and I love all kinds of films including the younger High School Musical movies. I watched this when it aired on MTV and I was very impressed. Sure it's hard to even compare to the high success of HSM, but it its own it was a great film. The songs were what caught my attention, a lot of reviews said they didn't enjoy the singing or songs, and I felt they were full of heart and I enjoyed most of them. The acting was quite good, some people could have used work, but what do you expect for a lower budget MTV movie? My sister kept hoping that Joey would cut his hair!

We were excited about all the So You Think You Can Dance people we saw in it! Neil from season 3 plays Drew, who was pretty funny. Thayne, Matt and Gev from season 4 are all seen which was pretty awesome!! I went out the next day and bought the movie.

Autumn Reeser plays a great bad girl as she did in The O.C, her song New You is pretty catchy and is a cool sequence. The two leads are good as well, because I had never really seen them before it was easier to get to know them in these singing roles. Their songs are very cool, like Ally's get even song Survivor, and the song Dreaming Wide Awake!

The DVD has some cool features, there are two commentaries, one by the cast and one by the director and the guys who play the janitors. They give some cool behind the scene stories on the movie making process, like filming in a real mall. There are music videos, and a short blooper reel, and learn how to dance, ha, may pass on that one. The deleted scenes give a little more on the interesting past of Madison's dad and Ally's mom, and a very short alternate ending that answered the question-What happened to the store?

All in all it was a good movie and the dvd has great features, unfortunately no behind the scenes. Take a chance, you may hate it or love it, it's certainly up to anyone. You may like some scenes and songs and not the others. Watch and just have fun!! Soon you maybe singing along!!",1218585600,9,2020,4.10632911392405
