1232887,1,B00000JJHV,"Forget this terrible movie and go buy some ""real"" Laurel and Hardy videos instead.
Bronson Pinchot plays Stan Laurel as a helpless rambling idiot (in the actual L&H films- Stan was dumb, but not nearly  as totally brainless as Pinchot plays him).  Gailard Sartain does a better  impersonation of Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice (from the  SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT movies) than he does Oliver Hardy.
None of the  timing, chemistry, milking of a gag, or comic genius that made Laurel and  Hardy so great are to be found here.  It's just another fast-paced  slapstick farce that's designed for kids.
And the mummy running rampant  reminded me of the 1953 film ROBOT MONSTER with the diving helmet on the  head of someone in a gorilla suit.
And what's a respectable actor like F.  Murray Abraham doing in this fiasco?
Again- if you have any respect or  admiration at all for Laurel and Hardy, I recommend forgetting this  abomination of a movie and buying some videos of the real thing instead.",951004800,17,999,4.738372093023256

1232889,1,B00000JJHV,"I'm a big fan of Bronson Pinchot, I thought he was great in Perfect Strangers (okay in Step by Step's last season, not so great in the Trouble with Larry or that alien sitcom from the late 90's). This is not so great a movie, the mummy looks like a child's craft and the story is weak. I am glad I waited for this to be on Youtube, because I would not want to buy it. It's not supposed to be impersonations, but it comes across that way; bad impersonations at that.",1397347200,2,465,4.065217391304348
1232890,3,B00000JJHV,"Just to be clear, this is not a definitive for Laurel and Hardy: it's more like a tolerable primer.

That said, the film is not too bad, revolving around Hardy trying to woo a lovely woman, who happens to be the target of a cult. Bronson Pinchot (Bauki from Perfect Strangers) is certainly a gifted character actor as Stanley Laurel, though he comes off as over-the-top with his hysterical shrieking. On a similar note, Sartain's Hardy is fairly convincing, as he pulls off the bully who claims to know how to handle things in a practical manner.

For a better grasp of the duo, watch the actual classic comedies, but if you just want a cheesy romp, this'll do.",1371168000,2,661,4.546218487394958

1232892,4,B00000JJHV,"For Love or Mummy is not up to the stanards of most L&H comedies, but it`s not as bad as some would have you believe. These guys
do a fair job with the L&H roles. Mind you it`s nothing to brag about, but they do a passible job of it. The real weak links in
the film are the story and supporting characters. The real L&H films had supporting characters that were just as nutty as they
were and that is lacking in this film. The story and plot could use some work as well.
The film isn`t great, but considering the gunk that hollyweird puts out these days, it could have been a lot worse.",1262995200,,586,4.060344827586207

They say immitation is the best form of flattery, and it is true. Bronson Pinchot & Gailard Sartain at times in reminded me so much of Laurel & Hardy, that the good,funny memories of watching their many films came to mind. If you want to watch a funny nostalgic movie like they used to make them-then this is for you. Gailard & Sartain are letter perfect in their portayals-it brought tears to my eyes!

1232895,5,B00000JJHV,"Just scroll down. Read the hate filled tantrum of the enraged Laurel and Hardy fan who brags about ""hating everyone"" while disgustingly using the victims of 911 in a twisted tirade against customers whose children like this movie. That is just one bizarre example of the excessive negativity that has plagued Laurel and Hardy fandom for decades.

Numerous Laurel and Hardy fans have traditionally hated many of the films starring Stan and Ollie. Consider THE BIG NOISE. Excessively negative fans hate it. NOTHING BUT TROUBLE? Hated. THE JITTER BUGS? Hated. THE AIR RAID WARDENS? Hated. THE DANCING MASTERS? Hated. UTOPIA? Hated. A HAUNTING WE WILL GO? Hated. THE BULLFIGHTERS? Hated. It's not surprising then that they hate this children's movie featuring fictional relatives of Laurel and Hardy.

Even the mere suggestion of children having fun watching this movie is hated. The previous post, with its disgusting comments about the tragedy of 911, demonstrates that hatred. It also shows how ugly some Laurel and Hardy fans can be. Sick remarks about 911 aren't even considered off limits. Such negativity demonstrates why good-natured Laurel and Hardy tributes deserve some credit.

Laurel and Hardy comics and cartoons filled me with joy as a child. They didn't fill me with hate. They were respectful, good-natured, and uplifting. This movie is another respectful and good-natured tribute, but it never had a chance of uplifting the spirits of the negatively inclined fans. Laurel and Hardy themselves ultimately couldn't even do that. The Boy's final feature films have been the objects of excessive hatred for years.",1183766400,2,1623,5.258687258687258
1232896,1,B00000JJHV,"I don't normally do this, but before I started writing this review I actually scrolled down and read a few other ""opinions"". The obvious one star ratings made me have a little faith left in humanity, but the amount of five star ratings made me hate everyone all over again.

And what is the REASON this insulting, possible legacy tarnishing catastrophe got five stars from these dim-bulbs? ""It's a fun movie for kids."" This is written on EVERY five star review (is it the same mouth-breather or what?) So, by THAT reckoning, re-making 911 but replacing the suicide bombers by cute fluffy animals, who put a furry paw over their eyes when they're about to crash, followed by a slide-whistle soundtracking the towers collapsing would be OK, too? 'Cos you know, that would be ""harmless fun for kids to watch at Halloween time"" too. Pffffff.

Anyway, I don't think I need to explain WHY this is so bad. Laurel and Hardy were too genuine one-offs. Genius entertainers who merged eye-watering slapstick with spot-on visual gags, with perfect timing and execution. These two hacks think that if they DRESS like Laurel and Hardy and try and SOUND like them, then the same big laughs will come thick and fast.

They don't. Not once. Not ever. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery in some aspects, but this is an insult, a cheap cash-in on a famous name. Don't be tempted, don't be fooled.

If people really ARE on the look-out for something to make their kids laugh, then show them the real Laurel and Hardy films. People falling through roofs and getting hit with ladders will ALWAYS be funny, especially if it's the two REAL masters at work. Show the kids Laurel and Hardy's ""The Music Box"", and leave this disgrace gathering dust where it belongs.

1232897,5,B00000JJHV,"The New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy: For Love or Mummy is a safe and enjoyable movie to show the kids in your life at Halloween. One reviewer suggests that a movie starring the ""REAL"" Laurel and Hardy would be better HALLOWEEN entertainment for kids, but most ""REAL"" Laurel and Hardy fans consider Laurel and Hardy's A-Haunting We Will Go to be ""garbage"" and despise the animated Laurel and Hardy's encounter with Scooby Doo too. These Scrooges completely miss the fact that Laurel and Hardy related projects like these provide fun for the littlest Laurel and Hardy fans who desire some spooky entertainment for Halloween. I guess the purists would rather have kids watch Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein instead.",1134604800,4,721,5.016666666666667
1232898,1,B00000JJHV,"One of the most pointless endeavors in recent memory is this 1998 attempt to recreate the Laurel & Hardy partnership. Bronson Pinchot (PERFECT STRANGERS, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and Gailard Sartain (FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, ALI), cast as the nephews of the original Stan and Ollie, help museum curator F. Murray Abraham (was this the only role available to the Academy Award winner?) track down a reanimated 3,000-year-old mummy. Pinchot and especially Sartain seem to relish the opportunity to replicate the two comedy legends, but co-directors Larry Harmon (the man behind the BOZO'S CIRCUS franchise) and John Cherry (the auteur behind the ERNEST movies) don't offer them much assistance.

Perhaps the most disheartening thing about this whole enterprise (aside from Larry Harmon's egomaniacal ""cameo"" in the film) is the fact that I've actually seen this DVD filed among legitimate Laurel & Hardy movies at outlets like Virgin and Tower Records. And as for showing this to kids...why don't you show them a REAL Laurel & Hardy movie?",1133049600,4,1028,5.2303030303030305

1232900,3,B00000JJHV,"I love Laurel & Hardy- they were the greatest comedy team in history. One reason for their greatness(and Oliver Hardy said it best)is that ""comedy is hard to do"". I disagree with the other reviews that this is a bad film- definatly not ""5 stars"", but not ""rock bottom"" either. ALSO, it is NOT a ""remake"" as other reviews have stated. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain portray the nephew's of the elder Laurel & Hardy(you hear them mention their uncle's, ""Stan & Olie"", if you listen carefully. They are just ""chips off the old block"". I think it's worth at least one viewing for any Laurel&Hardy fan. Not that bad!",1123459200,8,616,4.609090909090909

1232902,1,B00000JJHV,"This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence. New audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. It was to be expected. But, how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok (...)",1080259200,5,1002,4.698863636363637

The actors don't really capture Stan and Ollie for me and trying to place them in a modern situation doesn't work.  I couldn't shake the feeling that the L & H characters were terribly out-of-place in a story set in our current time frame. Just because Larry Harmon owns their likenesses doesn't mean we have to see Bozo in a Laurel and Hardy film.  Give me the real thing every time.  Save your money.",1061683200,4,472,4.390804597701149

This film neither looks nor feels like a L&H movie-it's too noisy, too frantic, and getting mixed up with monsters was not Stan and Ollie's forte, unless you count the bogeyman in ""Babes in Toyland"". It was Abbott and Costello and The Three Stooges who tangled with monsters. The actors do a good job in impersonating Stan and Ollie, so why not just do a film biography instead? Their lives were certainly more interesting than this mess. Paul from New Jersey",1049846400,,587,4.70873786407767

Bronson Pinchot was just a little too hyper for Stan who in his original films would at times go into a blank-faced stupor.
