8325045,5,B000EDWLRS,"As a gringo, who is still struggling with the language, these three DVDs are a very nice intorduction to the rich history of screen legends in Mexico.  Can't say how comprehensive they are, but there seems to be precious little available about these films ""north of the border"".  ""Los Grandos Gallos"" covers the careers of Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante, Pedro Amendariz, Emilio ""Indio"" Fernandez and Javier Solis.  Each segment shows a variety of short clips from their films.  ""Los Villanos"" focuses on the role of the ""bad guy"".  Again, there are many, many shorts clips from the films, with a brief nod to the screen adventures of Santo and the various terrors he faced as a masked wrestler.  ""De Divas a Divas"" covers a variety of female stars, with the greatest focus on Delores del Rio & Maria Felix.  Here again, yuo will find a great many clips.
  Be aware - If you demand Englsih and/or subtitles, you'll be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you just want to dive into the history of Cine Mexicano, this is an excellent way to begin.",1360108800,,1044,4.655737704918033
