2691961,1,B000KJTBYC,"I purchased this because it was advertised as being the full length version at 57 minutes. However, IT IS NOT the full length version. The movie runs for a little under 51 minutes. The quality of the movie is terrible. I am a collector of old western shows and rarely have I seen the quality this bad. The audio was very scratchy and patched up in some places. One whole segment of the audio was a second or two behind the video for almost 5 minutes.

The actual picture, is also terrible in quality. There is a lot of dirt on the film and there has been no cleaning up or refurbishing done at all. It plays as a tiny picture in the middle of a big black screen. You can't see any detail and miss a lot of what is going on.

If you want to see this movie, I would not recommend that you waste your money on this version!!! Purchase one of the other edited editions (since I have yet to find an unedited version available). I think any other version would be better quality than this version was. Also, keep this in mind when you are searching for any other old movie. This company offers quite a few movies. I know they offer several other Roy Rogers movies on Amazon. They are also advertised as being full length movies. But, after my experience with this movie, I wouldn't think it would get any better with the others. Don't waste your money like I did!",1231286400,,1357,4.255813953488372

The story starts with a poster asking ""Loyal Americans"" to ""Preserve the Union"". Cavalry Captain Mason meets a group of men; he is a Confederate spy who wants to keep Union troops busy so they can't reinforce General Grant. The US Secret Service is asked to solve this problem. Lieutenant Jerry Burke from military intelligence is the man to send there. Gabby joins him, so does a young woman. A robber stops the stage to steal the Army payroll. Jerry is a good shot, he recovers the payroll. Then we learn more about Captain Donald Mason, who gambles. Could an Indian Commissioner sell guns to the Indians? The sheriff pays for not pulling his pistol. Jerry captures Confederate spy. Then he investigates the ""Union Preservation League"" headquarters and finds evidence of treason. There is a confrontation, and Mason escapes.

Lylah Stanford is sorrowful over her seeming bad luck. Mason has men to back him, he allies with corrupt businessmen and a judge who plan to take the mines and ranches. Guns are sold to the Indians to attack settlers (who raise food). Can this be stopped? Jerry and his men capture the wagon load of rifles and lock up the driver. Mason's men arrive at night to free the prisoners. There is shooting, one man talks about the gang. With this news about Lylah affect Mason? The stage coach is hijacked. [Note the six horses needed for higher altitudes.] A posse is sighted, Mason leaves the coach for a horse. Jerry and the others ride out, then separate. Jerry is shot by Indians, but rescued by Don. Mason has a discussion about leadership with Macklin, their differences are ironed out. Jerry recovers to sing a song, and learns the latest news. Jerry and his men have a rendezvous at Durango, a surprise for Mason and his gang.

Mason's gang is pursued into the hills. [Note the use of breech-loading cartridge rifles in this Civil War era movie.] There is a shootout, Mason's gang surrender. Jerry, Gabby, and Sheriff Perkins pursue Mason and his friend into the dry desert. There is a last shootout. Mason is captured, but does not return to Denver. Jerry and Lylah leave Denver for St. Louis.

This is a better than average historical drama. You can see a young Milburn Stone playing a villain again. General Sibley (who invented the tent and stove named after him) led a Confederate Army force from Texas to conquer ""Silverado"". The Colorado Territory Militia commanded by Colonel Kit Carson defeated them in battle. Carson was then promoted to Brigadier General. [Note the use of cartridge pistols that were produced after 1870 in this drama set in the 1860s.]",1409788800,,2616,4.793791574279379

Roy is an undercover Union officer sent to the Colorado territory to stop a secessionist uprising.  Roy, Gabby, Pauline Moore, Milburn Stone, Hal Taliaferro and the rest of the cast do an admirable job, the film is a notch above the average B western being made at the time.

In short, I was a little surprised because most Roy Rogers movie are fairly light & breezy singing cowboy movies.  Now don't read too much into that, I'm not talking gut renching angst but the movie takes itself seriously.  The setting is during the Civil War.  The Union wants relief troops sent from Colorado to bolster the troops fighting the war.  But there are Indians & outlaws that prevents the relief troops from being sent.  Roy Rogers is then sent to get to the bottom of the problem and remedy it.  Hint the problem is Southern sympathizers that have formed a Rebel Underground.  Roy's brother is there and that's where the poignancy comes to play in the movie.",1454976000,,786,4.564285714285714
