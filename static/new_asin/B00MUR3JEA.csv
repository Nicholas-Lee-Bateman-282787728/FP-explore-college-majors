6602216,5,B00MUR3JEA,"Superb continuation from Series 3. And like its predecessor, Series 4 is less overtly gruesome than Series 1 and 2. If anything, 3 and 4 are even better, with superb writing and acting. Thankfully, brilliant Amelia Bullmore (DSI Gill Murray) is the Lead Writer for this series, writing four episodes.

She is well-matched by the extremely nuanced Suranne Jones as Detective Constable Rachel Bailey. They are members of the Metropolitan Police Major Incidents Team (MIT), headed by Amelia Bullmore as DSI Gill Murray.

One of the aspects we appreciate is the nuanced way the tensions of working in a bureaucracy are cleverly portrayed, as well as exploration of maintaining professional and private relationships.

There is a hilarious scene with her interviewing male prospects whilst speed-dating, using her plethora of unnerving professional detective/interview skills. Rachel is involved with a senior cop, a great guy, but they have issues. In the final episodes of the series, Janet and Rachel fight to protect the reputation of Gill. Series 4 is the best of the show, and we wish it would continue indefinitely, but this seems to be the final offing.

6602217,4,B00MUR3JEA,"This is a show about three smart, tough, hard-bitten cops who solve nasty murders, have huge personal issues, and are all mush behind the tough exteriors. The three are women (Scott and Bailey and their Boss, Gill). The show is massively tilted against men, who are scheming, dissimulating manipulators interested only in getting in the cops' knickers, or they are whingeing weaklings (colleagues/husbands/siblings) or they are bumbling superiors who couldn't catch a cold without the sage advice of our heroes.  All that said, it's a pretty good show, just routine, is all. Turning all the gender stereotypes in the opposite direction doesn't stop their being stereotypes. But, as I said, they are smart, and the banter and repartee is good, and the show is definitely worth a look. I gave it only 4 stars because I find the plots more than a little routine, but I'm only half way through the second season. Give it a look.",1425168000,,924,4.885350318471337

6602227,5,B00MUR3JEA,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014, and season 4 2015-2016.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, she drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring, and it seems separation is the name of the game. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 4, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim. Scott and Bailey work as a team most of the time, but they have their differences. Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes not to be called into DCI Gill Murray'S office. Didcipline and excellent police work is the word if the day- good series.

6602248,5,B00MUR3JEA,"Changes but continues 5 star good.
The past writer, Wainright, was missing due to another endeavor but not a problem with a pair of the lead acting cast continuing with their own abilities with ideas and writing skills. Suranne Jones, playing DC Rachel Bailey, adds plot ideas as she has done in the past. Amelia Bullmore, playing DCI Gill Murphy in all 8 episodes, steps up even more with her writing of episodes 1,2,7,8. Shes no rookie to writing for this series, having written 3 additional previous episodes while also playing a leading role. Lesley Sharp, as DC Janet Scott, continues a brilliant role even if she is not writing scripts. The show continues in top form; with perhaps a bit more emphasis on the lives of the 3 leading lady cops as they look to their future and changes (but Ill not give any spoiler details.)
Some cases take a couple of episodes to solve while others are resolved faster; but the lives of the police carry on throughout the season of 8 with issues coming and going, some solved others left in flux for a new seasons continuation. Its what is expected with a mature drama series.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes and the bonus material
Glad to see the show is commissioned for a series 5, airing beginning April 2016. Because of the continuation of character situations, its better to buy the DVDs and view them one after another, than have the delay between episodes on the Telly schedule.
Also fun to see Ellie Haddington (Foyles War Dickensian) playing a dastardly mean lady again in the last 2 episodes. Shes so believable, makes your skin crawl.",1459641600,,1587,4.667857142857143
6602249,4,B00MUR3JEA,Have watched all S&B series and love them all but in season 4 a couple of episodes I thought would continue to a conclusion leapt into an entirely new episode. Otherwise would be 5 stars.....,1459209600,,191,4.485714285714286
6602250,5,B00MUR3JEA,"Scott & Bailey is an addictive BBC detective series.
When we first started with season one we weren't sure what we had started.
But give it a try and it does indeed grow on you as the characters are developed.
It is now one of our favorite detective series. As with all of the good quality detective series form the BBC start with the first season and work your way through sequentially. The British are so good at the gradual development, at inserting little things that explain or enhance something that comes in later episodes. If a person watched random episodes, they would be good but not nearly as good as the sequential viewing from episode one and through the series. So always start at the beginning and follow it through then you too would be anxiously waiting for Season Four's release.",1459209600,,798,4.626760563380282
6602251,5,B00MUR3JEA,"Season 4 of Scott & Bailey represents a nice finish to the series, but not so fast . . . there are reports of a 3-episode season 5 to be done next summer.  The principal change in season 4 will not be perceptible to most viewers.  Sally Wainwright had moved on to other commitments and Amelia Bullmore (DCI Gill Murray) was installed as chief writer.  The reason that most will not notice the change is that the transitions are all seamless: top scripts, superb acting, solid atmospherics, the perfect blend of humor/drama/gore and a very satisfying ending.

Fans of the series will thoroughly enjoy the season 4 finale, but American viewers should consider their options carefully.  If you purchase an all-regions dvd player, you can not only acquire shows that are unavailable in the U.S. and get UK releases before they reach our shores (Downton Abbey, e.g.), you can also comparison-shop.  The British version of S&B, season 4, e.g., sells for about a third of the U.S. version.  For approximately the same cost you could purchase the complete seasons 1-4 from the UK rather than just season 4 from the US.

I have two all-regions players, both made by Pioneer.  These are sold by Amazon.com.  Mine were approximately $75 and $125.  If you watch a lot of UK television (some is distributed by our friends, the Dutch), an all-regions player pays for itself very quickly, as well as opening up new opportunities for purchase.",1449273600,2,1427,4.807377049180328
6602252,5,B00MUR3JEA,"This season shows the most startling changes in all of the characters. First and foremost, our two female detectives are not getting along. They both want the same job. They both are sick of one another's private lives and problems. There is no actual cat fight out in the street but it is a close thing. Next, their superior officer, a woman who has always been tough as nails and totally competent, has progressively become an alcoholic. It is seriously throwing off her ability to do the job. The two detectives have always admired her greatly so are they going to have to be the ones to turn her in to the higher ups? Romance blooms off and on for these two as well but one gets the feeling that long range it will always be more off than on. This is totally realistic for being in the police force as is their superior's alcoholism. This show is immensely gutsy for not ducking these issues just because our leads are all women. As usual, they are excellent at solving their cases since that is the one area of their lives where they do excel without fail. I have always enjoyed Lesley Sharpe in everything she's done for the BBC (the blonde on the box).",1443484800,8,1159,4.420560747663552

6602254,4,B00MUR3JEA,"We love this series and will be watching these DVD'S over and over again.  However, we must say that this last series 4 was not written by Sally Wainwright.  She wrote the earlier ones.  It wasn't as ""gritty"" as her writing.  It was a little tamer, but still good.  However, it lacked a certain spark that Sally brought to the writing.  Having said this, we still recommend Series 4.  Sorry to see this great program end.  It was the only one where women were treated as if they are capable, intelligent, and can be take charge people.

It tied up the loose ends but it didn't have the jarring story lines of the previous years that hooked us into the series. The brutality that the first reviewer wrote about in the first 3 years is what slapped you to attention and the cooing and calm of the closing interview with the suspect was riviting because of the brutality of the crime and equally brilliant in its simplicity....just calmly stating what happened and watching the jabs hit their mark...something I really missed in these episodes.",1437350400,8,776,4.321917808219178
