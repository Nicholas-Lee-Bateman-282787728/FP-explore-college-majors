2643816,5,B000HWZ4DY,"Purchasers should note that this volume, like the first volume, not only IS a ""season"" compilation, due to the varied number of episodes in each season, each volume extends beyond the individual seasons.  They are not simply ""selections of episodes"" they are in fact in the order of original broadcast.

Volume 1 consists of all of season 1 and most of season 2.

Volume 2 contains the last 3 episodes of season 2 and about half of season 3 (by far the longest season in terms of number of episodes).

It is likely that Volume 3 will be the final collection for this series with the remaining half of season 3 and the 5 episodes of season 4.

The Animaniacs collection on the other hand should require 4 Volumes to complete.",1166054400,41,724,4.4961832061068705
2643817,5,B000HWZ4DY,"They're going to try and take over the world.  So...maybe the two misbegotten lab rats from Acme Labs have never quite succeeded, but their list of attempts is astounding.  In this Season Two box set, the duo tries everything from cloning, which ends up with the pair being parents because Pinky's toenail got in the mix, to episodes based in the 1947 Los Angeles of Humphrey Bogart in ""Brain Noir"" which happens to be my all-time favorite Pinky episode.

No matter what mood you're in, the pair is good for a laugh.  Their deadpan double entendres are enough to keep especially jaded and cynical adults laughing.",1165881600,8,613,4.754716981132075

2643819,5,B000HWZ4DY,"A welcome follow up to the first season, this second volume has more of the same in an excellent series that has no peer.

Spun off from Animaniacs, the second season of this show continues to follow the exploits of Brain the power-hungry lab mouse and his insane counterpart, Pinky. Although the characters are driven by their wish to 'take over the world', most of the episode plots follow this structure: - Brain has a bizarre idea on how to take over the world, they discover that they require money/special equipment etc, they spend most of the episode obtaining the required stuff, they are thwarted usually by Pinky's studidity. Like Wile e Coyote, the characters tend to lose the point of thier plans and get embroiled in ever more wierd adventures. Only really having the two titular mice constant in every episode, this series is not afraid to develop plot and character instead of striving for 'a laugh a minute'. This leads to gentle and subtle humour (or as gentle and subtle as power mad, egotistical and insane mice can get!).

A far cry from today's hyperactive cartoons that tend to give me a headache.",1162771200,29,1119,4.733333333333333

2644003,4,B000HWZ4DY,"""Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe...""  (Yeah, you know how it goes.)

The little lab rats with a gigantic plot are back in another new 4-Disc DVD set with 22 more episodes that may leave you in stitches.  As they scour the globe in hopes of ruling it, the smart mouse, The Brain, and his dim-witted sidekick, Pinky, will finally get their chance.  ...Or not.

Either way, witness their latest and perhaps not so greatest plans in episodes like ""Hoop Schemes"", ""This Old Mouse"", ""Brain Storm"", ""The Pinky Protocol"", ""Mice Don't Dance"", ""Brain Acres"", ""The Real Life"", ""Brainy Jack"", and my favorite, ""Pinky and the Brain ...and Larry"".  These episodes may not guarantee success in taking over the world, but they do guarantee big laughs.

This new set has a brand-new special feature called ""The Audition"".  This has the voices of Pinky and the Brain, Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche, giving a voice-acting lesson to superstars Mark Hamil and Wayne Knight for a casting call of an upcoming movie.  (I'm REALLY anxious to see that.  The movie, I mean.)

The world may not yet be their oyster (or in this case, their cheese platter), Pinky and the Brain's outlandish schemes for world conquest still continue.  Plus, get the new ""Animaniacs, Vol. 2"" with some more wacky attempts at their ever-difficult goal.

2644007,3,B000HWZ4DY,"If you hadn't seen the first season - or the episodes in the Animaniacs - you would wonder why there was such enthusiasm for this series.  The basic P&B formula - intricately plotted schemes involving over-the-top assumptions/requirements and parodying major movies and the like - is missing from too many of the episodes here. It's as if the authors of those scripts had seen P&B, but not understood the concept.

The front-loading of particularly lame episodes emphasizes the problems of this volume: I inadvertently loaned this volume to a friend - instead of volume 1 - and the feedback was ""It gets better if you stick with it.""  My understanding is that the volume represents the original order of the episodes, rather than trying to be something that stands up as an isolated product.

My rating of mediocre is based upon these episodes being more enjoyable to  an established fan than to someone encountering the material for the first time.",1177286400,4,949,4.90625

And there are few Pinky and Brain souvenirs around, although we managed to find a few. So we(and our grandchildren) were overjoyed to find these DVDs. We had using some episodes that we had recorded off the TV, but some of these were incomplete, and we missed many good ones. Now we have all,or most, of them, and it is a real pleasure.

8141679,5,B000HWZ4DY,"Pinky and the Brain is one of the best cartoons ever created and I am glad that I purchased it. The cartoon is about two mice; one brilliant and the other not so much. The Brain has plots to take over the world and his side kick is there to try and help him with his plans. The plans never work but the Brain continues to try - he never gives up!! I love this series and have shown it to my children, who are now huge fans!! I would purchase from the seller again; it arrived on time and in great condition.",1462060800,,507,3.9320388349514563
