8490378,4,B0060HLHOU,"THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is a diversion. At times what works well in a novel doesn't translate to the screen: the magic of the reader's imagination can be more powerful than the visualization of a screenwriter and director. Such is the case of Audrey Niffenegger's novel - an escape into a world of the unknown (time traveling) that played well on the page largely due to the writing skill of the author. Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay makes a mighty attempt to make visual the imaginary magic of the novel and thanks to CGI it pulls off the rather strange effects of appearing and disappearing of a time traveler. Robert Schwentke directs with a hefty dose of saccharine though, making what could have been a delicate story somewhat lugubrious.

Henry DeTamble (Ertic Bana) has the genetic code that allows him to travel backward and forward in time - a trait that requires a certain degree of acceptance on the part of the audience. We see Henry as a child, as a young man who meets a girl who will on a different 'trip' be a woman Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams), and witness a bizarre courtship between a couple whose match seems made in heaven.... Along the way Clare's friends (Jane McLean as Charisse and Ron Livingston as a vastly different Gomez than in the novel) figure into the quasi-normal relationship/marriage that takes place. The tale can be confusing if the viewer is not willing to enter the realm of 'possible' and the main guide of the film seems to focus on the fact that whenever Henry time travels, he ends up in his new destination naked (there are many scenes of Eric Bana just searching for clothes). Of course the film can't have a logical ending, but the ending selected, corny though it is, fits the story. Lost of sugar to swallow here, but if you're in a Valentine mood it is a pleasant diversion. Grady Harp, February 18",1518998400,,1851,4.6432926829268295

8490380,5,B0060HLHOU,"Henry (Eric Bana) a research library is greeted by a young lady named Clare (Rachel McAdams.) Clare knows Henry. In fact, she has been in love with him all her life. Therefore, Clare knows Henry. However, Henry does not know Claire. Yet Henry knows the Clare knows him and why.

After we dispense with who knows whom and why, after we dispense with how it is possible or improbable. We get to the point this is an extremely complex and intriguing love story without all this sappiness that distracts from a very good viewing experience.

I have had the good luck or misfortune of watching this movie before reading the book. You can see from the pacing of the movie that there was a terrific effort to adapt and include the highlights and the essence of the book to the point that they are duplicates and not trying to just make a movie with the names and places.

I have only seen the Blu-Ray version. They took great pains to describe how wonderful Blu-Ray is before the movie starts. However, there is an appalling lack of DVD goodies or extras like a voiceover by the actors or directors.

Some movies just deserve top billing without having to dissect it to find out why.",1417910400,,1176,4.507042253521127
8490381,5,B0060HLHOU,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It's really a story about a relationship with a secret that could be highly destructive, yet the two people overcome the obstacles it presents.  The story is charming, though a bit fanciful.  (So, when was the last time that a movie was about fantasy???)  It's far better than the average romance and I think it explores the depths of relationship and the human capacity to overcome adversity within a unique story.  Enjoy!",1347235200,,459,4.7594936708860756
