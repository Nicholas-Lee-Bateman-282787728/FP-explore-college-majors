8144925,2,B000A7BQS8,"Disappointing sequel to Monicelli's superb original, but amusing in parts, not a complete misfire. It is wonderful to see Mastroianni and some of his cohorts reappear, but the zing of the original is missing. Shame Claudia Cardinale and Carla Gravina don't make a comeback here. It may improve with repeated viewings so I will keep the DVD handy.",1299542400,2,346,4.982758620689655
