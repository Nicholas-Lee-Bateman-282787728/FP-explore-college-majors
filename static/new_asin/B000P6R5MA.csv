8189197,5,B000P6R5MA,Wonderful biography!,1424908800,,20,9.5
8189198,4,B000P6R5MA,This was a biography done by A&E for their biography program. The biography was wonderful with much background info and interviews with people who knew and worked with him. My only complaint is the sound and picture were not completely in sync. That may be a problem with the specific DVD I received. Otherwise I highly recommend it.,1282176000,,333,4.758620689655173
8189199,5,B000P6R5MA,"ATTENTION BORIS KARLOFF FANS: This DVD is the most comprehensive overview of his life and works.  This A&E documentary is so complete and well-executed that it earned the highest praises from members of Boris' own family.  (I know this, because they told me so themselves). It is LOADED with rare clips that you'll see nowhere else, such as the only footage shot of Boris in his Frankenstein makeup in color.  IT IS BEING DISCONTINUED, so if you are even a moderate Karloff fan, BUY IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN DO SO! Consider this your final, friendly warning.",1262822400,,556,4.711340206185567
8189200,5,B000P6R5MA,"I never realized how handsome he was as a young man and as an older man, too.  I loved his voice,too. He was a shy man, but I wish it told more of his private life. Enjoy!",1259712000,,171,3.6216216216216215
8189201,5,B000P6R5MA,"Biography has done a great job with the Boris Karloff show.  Karloff has always been one of my heroes.  His work in may different forms of show business are shown off.  Biography as usual does not emphasize problems or controversies and the biography is a puff piece, but a real good one.  I loved it when I saw it on TV and knew I had to order it.  It will be a surprise to those who only know him as the Frankenstein monster.",1255824000,,427,4.096385542168675
8189202,5,B000P6R5MA,"A most enjoyable portrait of a very remarkable individual.  I proudly share Mr. Karloff's month and day of birth but not the same year.  His portrayal of the Frankenstein monster remains a cinema classic.  Alas, many actors in lesser roles received Academy Awards; but he never complained.  Nor did he publicly complain that his role in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" was given to Raymond Massey when the film was made.  Truly a gentleman until the end of his life.

Peter Graves did an excellent job as narrator.  It was wonderful to see the footage of Boris' daughter Sarah as well as Lugosi's son.  The clips from ""This is Your Life: Boris Karloff"" were interspersed nicely throughout.  Biography did its usual excellent job of research with lots of photos, interviews and anecdotes included.

If you love the undisputed King of the Monsters and his multi-faceted film roles (including The Mummy and Fu Manchu), don't hesitate to add this to your collection.  I'm certainly glad I have it.",1240876800,,984,4.867469879518072
