2403599,4,B000B6TTC8,"I am a great fan of CSI and while I love all both the original and the NY franchise, CSI MIAMI is my favorite of the shows. I like the Horatio CAINE character and am a huge fan of actor David CARUSO. CSI MIAMI also has the great advantage of  unusual diverse locations (the ocean, the Everglades, marinas, etc) which are great backdrops for exciting crime stories, while on the other hand in Vegas there is just desert and neon-lights and New York has been the setting of  too many movies and series to be ""fresh"". Besides, CSI MIAMI stars stunningly beautiful Southern Belle Emily PROCTER :)

I finished the DVD box of season three a couple of days ago. It is great stuff that will appeal to all fans of the series. What I found particularly fascinating with season three is the effort and expenditure that went into it - you know, the episodes are more like condensed feature films for cinematic release. You have a plane crash (episode MONEY PLANE), a yacht ramming a bridge (LOST SON), a tsunami (CRIME WAVE), attacks with rocket propelled grenades (PIRATED), huge explosions (10-7, among others) etc  Really awesome! Okay, nitpickers will argue that the computer generated tidal wave in CRIME WAVE was not up to Hollywood blockbuster standard, but hey, it is a TV show! I have seen far worse computer effects.

Season three managed to add more human depth to the characters and their development. There is the death of Speedle in the first episode (very touching, indeed), his replacement by ambitious cop Ryan WOLFE and the evolving rivalry between WOLFE and DELKO, Calleigh's father is still unable to quit the booze (detailed in the unfortunately rather weak episode UNDER THE INFLUENCE) and Horatio learns that his brother is still alive (more on that in the last episode of the series). Personally I miss the Speedle character and I think Ryan WOLFE is a weak replacement. With all due respect to the fans of the character and actor Jonathan TOGO, but I find this over-ambitious and eager guy more than annoying!

Most of the episodes are great storywise, although there are some exceptions. For instance, the aforementioned episode UNDER THE INFLUENCE was quite predictable - from the moment it was established that Calleigh's father was involved in a car accident when driving drunk, I knew that the guy he run over was already dead long before the car hit him. Other more unremarkable episodes are MURDER IN A FLASH and ADDICTION.

PIRATED is my favorite season three episode. The plot concerns weapon smuggling with a fishing boat, high sea piracy and political radicals, who use RPGs to terrorize Latino immigrants (while a subplot in the episode revolves around cannibalism among sailors adrift the ocean in their life raft). Plot and forensics are top notch, e.g. when residue from the exhaust fumes of a bazooka is found in the nose of a culprit it puts him on the crime scene. However I have issues with the ideology this particular episode promotes - it goes out of its way to promote multi-culturalism, a point which is re-iterated in some dialogues towards the end of the episode again and again. That said, PIRATED is great.

Other great episodes are CRIME WAVE (although the heist plot - taking adavantage of a tsunami to rob a bank - is a bit too elaborated and complicated to be fully believeable) and SEX AND TAXES (concerning the violent deaths of not one but two revenue service agents). SEX AND TAXES also featured a forensic accountant finding essential clues to the crimes (being an accountant - albeit not a forensic one - myself, I simply love this episode).

It needs to be pointed out that even weaker episodes usually have their merits like freak causes of death (for instance by paint ball gun in the HELL NIGHT episode or decapitation by shutter [ADDICTION]). I really admire the imagination of the script writers, when they come up with stuff like the aforementioned (or a drive-by shooting by boat in PRO PER.)  And suffice to say that the forensic stuff is hugely educational, well made and simply great!

There is a host of extra features on disc 7. These include:

* CSI MIAMI DEEP BLUE SEA - a very interesting featurette about underwater film shooting both in the ocean and in a fishtank.

* Two making ofs (CSI MIAMI DELIVERING THE GOODS and VISUALIZING SEASON 3). You have the usual interviews with the actors, where they elaborate on their respective characters, but also hugely interesting stuff about the stuntwork in the series and memorable look inside the shooting of the vault scenes when the tsunami wave hits the bank in the CRIME WAVE episode.

* An excellent 8 part featurette hosted by the series` consultant ( a real life coroner), which is an ultra fast paced crash course in forensic medicine ranging from autopsy proceedures to various causes of death (gun shot wound, blunt force trauma, asphyxation), illustrated with snippets from various episodes. Very interesting!

* A brief documentary on the locations. While I knew that much of the series is actually shot in California I was not aware of the large extent. A location scout is being interviewed commenting on the difficulties finding convincing stand in locations. It is also depicted how sometimes CGI effects are used for greater authenticity (e.g. to remove hills in the background,  as Miami is completly flat)

Despite some shortcomings a clear recommendation! Buy it now if you have not already done so!",1170288000,16,5432,4.829924650161464
2403600,4,B000B6TTC8,"Admittedly, I don't love this as much the original CSI set in Las Vegas, but I don't like CSI New York and don't watch that at all.  I really like this cast (and in the first episode of this season we lose Tim Speedle (who I thought was pretty good in it - maybe a little dull but a nice guy).  That was a sad episode but his replacement Ryan Wolfe (who's so cute) does a good job in filling the void.  He's an ex cop and takes some time fitting in with the team.

One thing you'll notice if you watch all three franchises is the colour they use for each show.  I find Miami is the most colourful.  Their lab is sleeker but the outdoor shots are stunning and use vibrant colours - often a lot of yellowy orangey tones (whereas New York is dull and blue and grey and Vegas is somewhere in the middle).

There are 24 episodes in this season and I'm always impressed with how they keep it fresh and different.  Someday I'm expecting them to run out of ideas, but in the meantime it's always interesting and really keeps you guessing.  There is a little more personal looks into the lives of the CSI agents which you don't see in Vegas, and it's a nice mix.

Overall, this is a great series but I do still prefer the original.  Either way, this is a smart and intelligent show that gets me watching every single week.  I really like it and hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1156636800,9,1370,4.109022556390977
2403601,5,B000B6TTC8,"I really enjoyed the entire season.  It had some of the most intense episodes yet, and a lot of the plot line is starting to unravel.",1138492800,,133,4.115384615384615
2403602,4,B000B6TTC8,"The turquoise blues and golden washes of light that show up in the episodes here, whether sky, sea or sun remind me of Maxfield Parrish prints.  This makes this series an incredible pleasure to watch.

In other ways the Miami part of the CSI franchise seems like the  juvenile delinquent younger brother of the original CSI.  Lots of loud explosions, gun shots and action.  Combined with the pretty pictures and Caruso's ability to suffer nonstop-- someone nominate him for sainthood-- this makes for a very watchable series.

However, there is one major nit that needs to be picked!  The episode with the tax man has a series of tragic events that begin with the IRS making an error in the amount of life insurance benefits paid out to a surviving spouse.  A two decimal point error made it impossible for the spouse to pay his tax bill.  Duh, guys, get your head out of the DNA lab.  Death benefits from life insurance aren't taxable income to an individual.

Surprised your forensic accountant didn't catch that one.  *Snort*",1135296000,,1028,4.745762711864407
2403603,5,B000B6TTC8,"I just finished watching the third season of ""CSI Miami"" and I have to say, it's definitely the best best season so far for this show. There is a major plot twist this season that will blow your mind!

2403604,5,B000B6TTC8,"Well, Season 3 seriously explained the catch phrase ""WE WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN!!!"" and HORATIO and his team of good looking ""hot"" shots just about had everything thrown at them that the criminals and mother nature had to offer. Armed with Intensity, his HUMMER and his Dark Shades - HORATIO KANE - darted around explosions, falling buildings, fires and his ""IS -HE-OR-ISN'T-HE-DEAD-BROTHER""... all in all the most entertaining season : visually outstanding, action packed and incredibly intense!!! Here's looking over the dark shades for SEASON 4!!! Again the ""YOU CAN ALWAYS BANK ON A WINNER"" Bruckheimer delivers the goods... This is ONE SEASON that needs to be standing in all it's glory on your DVD Shelf.",1132531200,7,709,5.120689655172414
2403605,5,B000B6TTC8,"Season 3 of CSI Miami really turned up the heat this season as we watch Horatio Caine and his team solve a slough of exciting crimes. In this season, Hortatio comes off as more of a superhero; every third episode or so he is running from an exploding building, narrowly escaping from some natural disaster like a tsunami or hurricane, dodging bullets and still managing to look fabulous with his designer sunglasses. Not that I am complaining, the action and excitement is packed into each episode.

Season 3 continues the story about Horatio's brother, Raymond, who is not dead, as told in the season 2 finale, we see more of Susie and Ray's daughter, Madison, and one of the CSI's dies in the first few episodes. Are you hooked yet? I certainly was after watching just one episode. Another great episode is about everyone's favorite coroner and Eric Delco being trapped AGAIN in the forrest preserve in a flash fire, deja vu all over again!

8. Speed Kills: Speed dating clientel are supected in a mysterious death.
9. Pirated: Pirates have apparently hit the coast of Miami after the bodies of a boat crew are found tied together in a chain in the ocean.
10. After the Fall: A man falls to his death off a modern apartment building and Horatio is accused of being too violent with the suspect. Brutality charges are brought against him.

24. 10-7: A wearhouse party explodes and the club owner is found dead and Raymond shows up again and his story is played out.

This season was much better than the previous two. Hortatio Caine, played by David Caruso is the next super-hero, and his CSI team is his sidekick. Wtih more action, suspense and unusual crimes to solve, this season will keep viewers rivited to each episode.",1126915200,35,4251,4.446153846153846

2403638,5,B000B6TTC8,"I cannot even explain how much I love this show so perhaps I am not the right person to review season 3.  I love the cast which included Rory Cochrane and there will never be another David Caruso.  In his younger days and the earlier episodes, he was definitely ""the man"".  I never tire of watching the episodes, especially when they were all so young and everyone was beautiful.  I tend to like the more typical Miami con man or woman episodes with shallow people with suspect values.  I used to live in Ft. Lauderdale and there really are people like that there.  Such a beautiful place but seems to attract some of the most screwed up people who are all about the money, gorgeous people and clubs that are fun for the shallow or curiously shallow.  That's really the only reason I watch the series because of the amazing cast of characters who make sometimes silly plots work just because they are so fun to watch and a little bit ridiculous.  Great stuff.",1427673600,,959,4.471264367816092

2403697,3,B000B6TTC8,"The third season of CSI Miami began very much in the same vein as the second, despite a major change in the cast.  Otherwise, the series had evolved both a successful formula and an effective visual style.  The formula, derived from the original CSI, involved one or two cases per episode, both decided primarily by the evidence. The cast had settled comfortably into their roles, although some of these remained undeveloped.  For the most part, the dialogue was designed to highlight David Caruso, who exudes a combination of virtue and professionalism.  The series could be gratuitously morbid.  Episodes like Crime Wave and Pirated go overboard in showing waterlogged bodies.  At times, the series could become a bit sanctimonious.  But apart from this, the scripts were well-written, with tight plotting.  After using a primarily episodic format, toward the end of the season the scripts began to incorporate longer story arcs, which led to the elimination of several minor characters.  The series' visual quality is one of its best elements.  The ocean and skies are shown in azure blue, while most of the exterior scenes in the city use orange and yellow shades.  In this respect, CSI Miami draws from the 1980s series Miami Vice, noted for its innovative color schemes.",1347321600,4,1276,5.057416267942584

2403709,5,B000B6TTC8,"This is a series I thought, especially in the first three years, that got better and better. This third year was an outstanding season and got very intense, on a personal level, in the last three episodes when Horatio discovers his brother Ray is still alive.  He had long-been considered dead. ""Why"" he's alive is good, too.

On DVD, these CSI-Miami episodes really shine (and more so on Blu-Ray, which is forthcoming) because of the fantastic, bright Florida colors.  I've always thought this was the best-looking of the stylish CSI shows.  Not only does the cinematography of this program look better on DVD, so is the surround sound.

The stories are interesting and the eye-candy is irresistible. The visuals in here, alone, make this worth the purchase.",1267142400,,759,4.94488188976378
2403710,4,B000B6TTC8,"The third season of CSI: Miami kicks off with the episode ""Lost Son"", in which the team of criminologists races to find an abducted child while dealing with the loss of one of their own people. It's a good start, and the rest of the season continues in much the same way. The audience learns more about the characters' backgrounds, and we finally find out what really happened to Lt. Caine's little brother, who disappeared while working undercover.
  The biggest problem with the show is its repetitiveness. Five minutes of each show are spent just watching the team members looking through microscopes and examining fingerprints. This was interesting the first few times I watched the show, but after a season or two I'm familiar with the way the team collects and examines evidence, and I wouldn't mind if less show time was spent in the lab and more was spent on the story itself. That being said, I do understand that the CSI franchise is about people whose job in real life is to analyze every piece of evidence, and no one is forcing me to watch the show, so I shouldn't complain too loud.
  Although the level of sex, drugs, and violence make CSI:Miami an inappropriate choice for families with young children, the stories are interesting and the actors are well-cast. The show would be a good choice for anyone who enjoys crime/cop drama, but if you're not a fan of the genre, then it would be a good idea to watch a couple of episodes and decide whether or not you like CSI:Miami before spending money on a whole season. It would also be best to begin with the first season, since many of the show's story arcs start there.
  For people who have seen some of Miami and are interested in purchasing some of the DVD's, I can only say that seasons two and three are my favorite thus far. The characters are well-developed, but the show wasn't so old at this point that it had lost its freshness.

P.S. Most of the products I review online (not just on Amazon) are books, so please don't be disconcerted by the fact that I'm critiquing a TV show, but my profile nickname has the word ""reader"" in it. :)",1261353600,,2108,4.517060367454068
2403711,4,B000B6TTC8,"Just watched my copy of CSI Miami Season over the course of a couple of weeks.

On the whole, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed watching Seasons 1 and 2 (seen within the past 18 months or so), because (for me) Miami has generally been my least favorite CSI franchise.  I think, with season 3, some of what's bothered me historically has started to crop up.

Now, on the whole, the stories are as good as ever.  And we're still earlier enough in the series that the only really improbable bit of tech they're playing with is the interface to their system itself (I give them a pass on that, as they need something that can be broadcast well, more than something that someone would actually use).  The tech they're using today makes me wonder when the taxes in Miami went up to 90% to pay for the crime lab's doodads.

But, as others have noted, the additional of Ryan Wolfe has been somewhat problematic.  We do have a throughline of character development with Ryan; his personal style develops throughout the season, with his dress sense growing sharper until he gets to his current ""copy the boss"" look (which I think he doesn't quite reach until season 4).  And, he can come across as something of a brown-noser.  But, even 5 years later, his relationship with his co-workers is inconsistent.  They can't quite seem to decide how well they all get along.  I mean, over in the Las Vegas show, David Hodges can be consistently obnoxious and annoying, while still being a useful and usable member of the cast.  With Ryan, they can't quite decide what they want him to be - and this tends to make the cases where he does rub Delko and Calleigh the wrong way stand out.

Moving beyond Ryan, there's the dropped plotlines.  It's never entirely clear to me what happens to Suzie and Madison (I think that's her name) after the episode where she needs a transplant from Ray Jr.  They've disappeared, and aren't even mentioned anymore.  Similarly, the heating up of the standing conflict between Horatio and Rick from IAB (initially aggravated by his becoming involved with Yelena, then getting worse when it looks like Rick's abusing Yelena) is basically dropped.  We're never sure what happened.  While that can be the point of a story, in some cases, it doesn't really feel like that here.  And Rick is still around today....

Then, there's the general sense of limited continuity.  We don't see Eric having problems with work or his personal life until he loses his badge during anonymous outdoor sex; he goes to see a counselor, a fact which is mentioned at most once again.  Horatio's relationship with the prosecutor seems to come out of nowhere, and then dissolve almost as quickly.  In future seasons, Ryan's gambling problem is handled similarly.

We know they can do better, especially in future seasons.  Follow-ups to Ryan's opening his mouth a bit too wide around a reporter, for example, are picked up in several future episodes.

Still, all in all, I enjoyed seeing these stories again, and do recommend them.",1247443200,,3022,4.697718631178708
