8160580,1,B000LAZQKI,Fred Willard is great but this is far from his greatest. You want to see Willard at some of his best try You Tube. I have many episodes of Fernwood Tonight that I taped off of TV many years ago but would love to see them released on a boxed DVD set.  I do not recommend.,1269993600,,270,3.8214285714285716
