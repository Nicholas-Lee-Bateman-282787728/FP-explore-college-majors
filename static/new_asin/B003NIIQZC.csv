8401166,5,B003NIIQZC,"..""desert"" film. Full of things that call out to the human being in you. There is lots to be defied
and scoffed at in this presentation, but sweetness and decency are not among them.
This story telling leaves you quite satisfied, Substance? Not so much.
Ahhh, But the aftertaste....warm and pleasant.",1377648000,,300,4.901960784313726
8401167,5,B003NIIQZC,"This is one of the most thoughtful and enjoyable movies I've ever seen.  It shows the best of humanity.  You'll laugh, you'll cry... and everything in between.  The characters and actors are amazing.  There's no sex or violence and you're still sitting on the edge of your seat.  Apparently this movie is not available in US format for purchase.  Too bad...I'd love to buy to add to my top 10 movies of all time to own.",1296259200,2,419,4.447368421052632
