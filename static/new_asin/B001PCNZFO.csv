""Chain Link"" isn't a new story... ex-con comes home to reunite with loved ones and still messes up... but the 'way' new filmmaker Dylan Reynolds wrote the dialog and his use of cinema verte' style camera work makes this film special somehow. It definately stands out from the majority of Independent films on the market right now. Dylan's scenes are mostly long, which gives you time to study these characters and become attached.  And the actors portray them so skillfully it sounds like they ad libbed the whole thing... but they didn't!  I was at a screening and asked that very question.  I especially liked a couple of  scenes between the ex-con, Anthony (Mark Irvingsen) and his mom (Jody Jaress) in the opening, and then a very emotionally charged phone call...EXCELLENT.  Oh, and the scene where Anthony talks to his son, Little Man (Luciano Rauso) about the facts of life!  You probably will never hear this explaination on film again!! I cracked up! The whole audience did... every show!  There are soooo many really good scenes that I'd be telling you the whole film if I keep going on.

I don't know why I'm writing this review other than I understand this is Dylan Reynold's first feature length film... and like Cassavetes first films (Shadows, with Lelia Goldoni from Chain Link), you may want to own Chain Link and then be looking for Dylan's next film and start a collection.  He's really good and you ought to see it.  Own it/rent it, but see it... in my opinion.",1236038400,5,1740,4.635179153094462

8333041,3,B001PCNZFO,"The acting was superb and the characters believable. Yes, it was a pretty in-depth character study, but I didn't enjoy watching the film because I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it. I have such a mixed reaction to this movie. I have no idea how I should rate it, so I gave it 3 stars. There was something great about this movie, and something I hated about it. I kept thinking the son is going to be really screwed up.",1419120000,3,436,4.141176470588236

8333043,5,B001PCNZFO,"I liked the junkyard owner right from the start.  His warped sense of time created a believable character you could easily enjoy.  The acting was very good.  The interaction between the man, his son, and his former wife was spot on.  I was drawn into the story and left wanting more.  The sex education scene between the father and son was absolutely wonderful.  Both funny and endearing.  Moments like these play throughout the film.  These were not actors reading from a script.  These were people living a role.  A very powerful movie everyone should see.",1417392000,3,558,4.778947368421052

8333045,5,B001PCNZFO,Strong character study with some fine acting. This is the kind of movie that you can watch multiple times and get something new out of it each time.,1390780800,4,148,4.321428571428571
8333046,4,B001PCNZFO,"Look no further. Aside from that, this was actually a good freshman film for this crew. Gritty, depressing, and hopeless, yet some believable performances.

The story follows a loser dad, played well by an unknown (as is the rest of the cast actually) who is losing all that has meaning since his recent stint in jail. Through the coarse of a single day, we see him try to bond with his estranged son, hold a job and stay out of trouble. Eventually, we come to see that this guy really has no hope of succeeding at anything, and will resort to the criminal ways in order to facilitate existing. The scenes are long, the acting believable, and the general feel of hopelessness is conveyed adequately.

Trivia wise, I think this has to be the only film where three of the actors that all got there starts in the 70s, disappeared for 30 years then came together for their first recognizable film in the 2000s. Their roles were my favorite parts of the movie - Jody Jaress who plays the heartfelt mother of the lead character, Peter Looney playing the way too old sheriff (reminded me of Levon Helm a bit) and Jim Storm playing the grumpy scrap yard owner.

The commentary is an example of how not to do one, and I lasted for 15 minutes before calling it quits. They had the whole acting crew and assorted staff present for a commentary party. I understand it was fun for them but trying to obtain anything meaningful out of all the conversations gets tedious. No other extras, the video quality is poor, out of focus at times and the audio is standard. But I couldn't really ding those aspects as it fits in with the dirty feel of the film. A 3-star film but an extra bump for the performances.",1239062400,2,1691,4.448387096774193
