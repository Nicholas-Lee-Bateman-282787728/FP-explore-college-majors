It begins with Union troops marching along a road in September 1862. They stop by a river. There is a rumor about action. What will the soldiers do? Stand or run? Henry Fleming does sentry duty along the river at night. The soldiers perform their drill. Then they are ordered to march out. Henry talks about the fighting. The soldiers cross a chest-deep stream. They hear gunfire, then see a dead soldier. They advance into the woods, then are ordered to double-step. The Colonel orders them to take the hill. Union soldiers run away, the Rebs advance. They must hold the line. They fire and reload. Keep firing! orders their officer. The Rebs retreat. The Union wounded leave for the rear. The Rebs attack again, some of the Union soldiers run away.

This second charge is held. Henry talks to Jim, who got shot. Another soldier guides Henry back to his regiment. Other men were scattered but returned. What will they do today? The Rebels attack, the Union soldiers fire volleys. Henry runs in front until an officer orders him to return. They fill their canteens from the creek in the rear. Their regiment will reinforce where the attack is expected. They are ordered to attack. Men fall. Rebel soldiers are captured, they are from Tennessee (the Union soldiers are from Ohio). The Union soldiers are marched to a new location. Henry is content.

Stephen Crane wrote this novel in 1894 at age 22, based on the stories he heard from actual veteran soldiers. Crane later died of tuberculosis, the #1 killer of people who were in the prime of life. Audie Murphy was a sharecroppers son from a small town east of Lubbock, Texas. He was the most decorated US soldier of WW II. This is worth watching once, it is a low budget movie that takes place in a few days. Note how the Union soldiers fired their guns while half of them reloaded. The movie To Hell and Back is a better movie and more educational as well. Too bad it has been banned from most broadcast TV stations since the 1980's.",1480636800,,2022,4.580110497237569
