5408511,3,B00AB2NYSM,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this movie anyway because I am a great fan of Gordon MacRae. I was very disappointed, though, with the screen shots. I loved the movie itself, but sometimes an actor was cut off the side of the screen. You might be able to see their arm or hand to know they were even in the scene. I agree that this movie should have been released in widescreen. Are the studios in such a hurry to release a movie that they don't care in what format it's released? So sad for the viewers. We are the ones who miss out.",1357862400,12,551,4.158878504672897

5408513,2,B00AB2NYSM,"I was going to buy this but NO WAY if only in a pan & scan version. I cannot understand such old-style thinking from a corporations marketing dept. If it is true (as mentioned in another review) that a new full-screen print has recently been made by the same studio then it is just not forgiveable to be releasing this version. WAKE UP or die studios, it's the 21st century, your back catalougue should be working FOR you, not trashing your rep.",1356652800,23,445,4.439024390243903
5408514,1,B00AB2NYSM,"Hello Fox-Archive... how stupid are you? This movie was filmed in Cinemscope and you're bringing it out on DVD in 4:3 (1.33:1)? How stupid is that in the 21th Century and in the age of 16:9 TV's?

Movie could be good with good actors like Gordon McRae... but the DVD? Hello?

sorry, I don't buy it.",1356048000,23,298,4.303571428571429
5408515,1,B00AB2NYSM,"What is particularly maddening about this awful pan and scan DVD release of THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE is that it didn't have to be this way.  The film went thru the Fox studio's restoration department in the last year or so and a new 35mm CinemaScope print was made.  Because of this work, a new anamorphic widescreen transfer of the film should have been provided for this DVD release.

The folks at Fox who are in charge of this Cinema Archives DVD program don't appear to have any enthusiasm for it.  At the very least they must not have the budget to do their work properly.  The reason the Warner Archive collection has been so successful is that the WB catalog staff puts a lot of effort into their product.  That's why they have well over a thousand titles available and most of them are of good to excellent quality.  Also, all of their widescreen CinemaScope films are available in anamorphic 16x9 widescreen.

If the Fox Cinema Archives doesn't try harder to put out quality discs, they'll quickly discover that no one will buy their product and the whole program will die off.  Unfortunately these discs are now met with suspicion by collectors and few will buy them until reviews hit the internet.  Though some of the releases have looked really nice (CAREER WOMAN, ONE FOOT IN HELL and a handful of others) many have been disappointing.  At $15-$20 apiece, most folks will not risk their money on a library that's turning out to be one big crap shoot.",1355788800,37,1471,4.576335877862595
5408516,1,B00AB2NYSM,"This is a wonderful musical and deserves the full wide screen treatment. As much as I love this movie and have been wanting it on DVD, I will NOT buy this pan & scan DVD. It is an insult to the original movie.",1355443200,57,209,3.883720930232558

I urge everyone to contact 20th Century Fox

5408527,1,B00AB2NYSM,"I am only coming in on this title, not to review the film itself but to support those who have been dismayed by this Fox pan and scan release. Perhaps the person or persons responsible at Fox might take notice of what their public really do want, after all, thats what show business is all about! This film was in fact shown on British television a few short years ago, both in Cinemascope and with its original stereophonic soundtrack. I think it might well have been through Film Four, who also produce films. I would still prefer to have a legitimate DVD (or even blu-ray?) of this sparkling film, as with all of the musicals of this period (even some of the not so hot ones). Its the only way to watch them. Anything less isn't legitimate value for what the companies expect people to pay for. As for Twilight releases, why should it be left to that exclusive based company? Their higher prices are set because they expect limited sales. The big companies are far more concerned about their newer films. Unfortunately, that might give you a clue as to how much respect and regard they have for the earlier films.",1369699200,6,1116,4.52970297029703

5408529,2,B00AB2NYSM,"This was a big Fox CinemaScope production about three song writers, however, in this cropped version we are lucky to get two on the screen at a time. The big musical numbers have been ruined by not presenting the film in the original scope. Is this how Fox are going to treat their back catalogue from now on? If and when they arrive can we only expect ""Beneath The Eight Mile Reef"" and ""The Showers of Ranchipur"".",1362614400,9,414,4.3896103896103895
5408530,3,B00AB2NYSM,"I don't know why Gordon MacRae made this movie. Most of the singing is done by the other actors. Dan Dailey was always a charming musical star, but Ernest Borgnine? As for Sheree North - apparently her voice was dubbed. She got the most songs, and whoever dubbed her was hardly a singer either.  MacRae's big number was The Birth of the Blues, but he did not even get to sing the charming title song. What a pity.",1362441600,3,413,4.294871794871795
5408531,1,B00AB2NYSM,"I've been waiting for a home video release of this film since laserdiscs started coming out with letterboxed releases.  Guess I'll have to wait a little longer.  What a scandal that in this day and age the people with the ability to make things happen don't have the knowledge necessary to do things right.  I'm hoping that someday soon the ""Twilight Time"" Blu-ray people will start doing for 20th Century-Fox musicals what they've been doing for their non-musicals - like ""The Egyptian"".  ""The Best Things in Life Are Free"" and ""Mardi Gras"" and ""April Love"" would be perfect titles to start out with.  ""Cinema Archives"" should switch to releasing vintage TV programs since they seem to be stuck in 1.33:1 mode.",1361491200,10,711,4.8429752066115705

Gordon MacRae is in fine voice it really shows when he sings The Birth Of The Blues. the whole production is fabulous great musical numbers and orchestra conducted by Lionel Newman the roaring twenties songs and music is great fun even Ernest Borgnine gets to do some numbers he really fits in well with Dan Dailey,Sheree and Gordon. This really is a delightful film directed by the great Michael Curtiz, now with Fox could only find a CinemaScope print to show this film in all its widescreen glory i would give 5 stars heres hoping!",1361232000,5,661,4.563025210084033

5408534,1,B00AB2NYSM,"I cannot believe,in this digital age, that Fox, despite having recently re-mastered THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE,would release the DVD panned and scanned. What are the executives who make these decisions thinking of? That cinephiles eager to own a copy of this terrific musical are a bunch of idiots who wouldn't notice the difference? Utterly disgraceful! If this is the insensitive way Fox treats its archive, include me out(to quote the great Sam Goldwyn).

5408535,1,B00AB2NYSM,"It's 2013 and widescreen TVs have been the ONLY TVs for sale now for at least 3 years now (when I finally got mine), probably more like 5 years.

To release a film on DVD in pan-and-scan full screen when the original ratio was widescreen is mind-numbingly incompetent...and what's double sad is it's probably just as much contemptuous of Fox towards customers for these widescreen films. Really, what moron is in charge of releasing this series for Fox Home Entertainment? I'm not being too harsh when I say whoever the dolt is who greenlit ALL of these cinemascope releases as full screen dvd releases deserves to be tarred, feathered, and run out of the 20th Century Fox offices on a rail!

And it does seem to encompass all of their made-on-demand titles, too, because I've wanted about a dozen of them on disc now since dvds were first released, and all the ones they're releasing in this half-assed program are in the wrong fullscreen format.

My only recourse, and I beg other film collectors to do the same, is to a) contact Fox by whatever means is convenient or preferable to you and let them know how inconsiderate of film fans this screw-up is on their part, and b) boycott not just the wrong aspect releases but ALL the dvds they're releasing in this program until they get off their asses and nip this FUBARistic practice in the bud before it can proceed any further. The old saying of ""money talks"" is very true, but you know what can said to be an equally true saying? ""No money talks even louder!"" So don't give Fox a penny until they wise-up and make things right.",1358553600,20,1581,4.559859154929577

8549610,2,B00AB2NYSM,"The movie is about a trio of songwriters who also begin to produce Broadway musical plays.  As in many backstage musical movies, the plot is rather thin, primarily a vehicle for the songs and dances.  All sing well except Ernest Borgnine, who mercifully does very little singing.

This item would have well worth the half-price I paid for it (with a coupon) except that

The DVD has the quality of a VHS, across the board:
- Presented aspect ratio is 4:3 instead of the movie's native CinemaScope
- Video quality is at the level of VHS
- No extras, no scene selection, no menu at all.

If I were a naive optimist, I would hope that Fox would eventually remaster this movie properly onto a Blu-Ray and offer it for $5 to those customers who purchased this low-quality DVD.",1391990400,2,771,4.517985611510792

I did tape it from a TV programme some 20 years ago, with adverts, but have always tried to find a video which is such a pleasure to have found it. Unfortunately one of the only ones that Dan Dailey doesn't dance in- great pity, as the dance routines are lovely.  I would like to add  that Sheree North is superb in those dance routines and the music makes one nostalgic for the good old days, songs are beautifully interpretated by Gordon MacRae and Dan Dailey and Ernest Borgnine couldn't have done better. I hope this video will get the attention it deserves. Anna Parkinson",1370563200,3,744,4.416058394160584
8549613,4,B00AB2NYSM,"""The Best Things In Life Are Free"" is a musical bio-pic about the writing trio of DeSylva, Brown and Henderson who gave us many memorable tunes in the 1920's.  What strikes one as a bit strange is the casting of Ernest Borgnine as one of the three composers.  Yes...that Ernest Borgnine who was such a despicable villain in ""From Here To Eternity"" and ""Bad Day At Black Rock"".  Also, in this film, Dan Dailey is meek, mild and subservient.  We are used to seeing Dailey as the outgoing, back-slapping wisecracker.  The female lead is played by Sheree North was was one of the many blonde bombshells of the 1950's who did not go far in films.  The musical numbers are all very familiar and we even see how they went about composing 'Sonny Boy' for Al Jolson.  This 1956 film from 20th Century Fox does not hold up to the lavish M-G-M musicals of the same era but it is a watchable and interesting film and definitely worth viewing just to see Ernest Borgnine sing and dance!",1370476800,3,973,4.463276836158192
