8198109,1,B000QXCZI6,"Moomin 4 disc Colletor's Set 1 is defectively recorded and the stories are strange and unpleasant.  I bought Set 2 at the same time and haven't bothered to open it.

This seems to be a spin-off product, not close to the books. The sound recording has an echo -very annoying. The stories are off too. They are not the subtle, witty, and emphathetic stories Tove Janssen wrote.

Unfortunately for me, I did not learn that it was defective until after the return period, so I've paid $100 for nothing. Don't let it happen to you.",1305849600,3,526,4.515789473684211
8198110,4,B000QXCZI6,"It's a great product, but I was expecting to have, at least, the original Japanese track. I'm okay with the english translation, but for once I was dying to hear the original voices...nonetheless, it's a great series and that I loved purchasing. It actually convinced me of buying the second collector's set.",1297036800,5,308,4.9423076923076925
8198111,5,B000QXCZI6,"Moomin was a hit show in Japan in 70's. I was  little and still remember some of the episodes. My 5-year old daughter liked it, too. we'd like to collect all of them.",1287360000,,166,4.03030303030303
8198112,4,B000QXCZI6,This is a great 4 disc set.as for the echo in the background it lasts for approximately 1 minute during episode one and thats it. I don't know why that is a problem at all.and the video quality is great too.if its a little grainy that just adds to the atmosphere.,1238803200,,263,4.176470588235294
8198113,3,B000QXCZI6,"Having grown up with the Moomins, we got this for our daughter and there's no question that the Moomin stories are a wonderful and creative alternative to the standard Disney fare. The animation is done by a Japanese team and the images are colourful and masterfully directed. If you are interested in set you should be aware of a few slight issues with this set, however:

1. The discs are all DVD-R discs and don't work in all DVD players. I have a fairly new Sony DVP-NS76H DVD player and these discs don't play properly. The menu comes up but you can't start the episodes. Thankfully, the discs played without problems on the PS3.

2. The video quality is quite poor for a DVD. The picture is grainy with some minor stability problems and the audio has a slight echo. Overall it's comparable with a medium quality VHS tape.

3. There are no subtitles or alternative audio tracks.

Overall, we would still recommend this set but feel slightly let down by its execution. It would've been great to see a properly mastered / produced set to give the Moomins the presentation they deserve to truly appeal to a wider audience.",1212624000,34,1124,4.605
8198114,4,B000QXCZI6,"The Moomins need no introduction. This cartoon show, however, may. Around 1990, Telecable Beneluxe and Bulls Tokyo created a tv cartoon series on the Moomins. This was to be the first cartoon series to get the approval of their creator, Finland-Swedish author/painter Tove Jansson. The series stayed more true to the spirit of her philosophical Moomin world, and it still is a series watched by people the world over - it has as much universal appeal as the books have always had.

Who doesn't know innocent, adventurous Moomin? Or the consistently-stoic Moominmamma? The restless, sometimes boyish Moominpappa? The irresponsible Little My or the carefree vagabond Snufkin? I for one have yet to meet a person who doesn't. In the first 12 episodes, included on this set, we follow the Moomin family and friends as they find a magic hat, discover a desert island, help an invisible child become visible again and deal with a horrific monster. However, the little things in life are also present, such as friendship, rivalry, depression and even falling in love. The immense popularity of these series is not surprising to me, because they are very sincere, and thus remain true to the books. The voice acting is, for the most part, spot-on - with the possible exception of Moominpappa, who sounds a little too lighthearted for a restless soul like him, in my opinion. Also Ninni's (""The Invisible Child"") voice actress fails at progressing her voice at a pivotal point of the story, which cuts the impact of her road to becoming visible again - a bad error, as far as I'm concerned. But these are minor flaws, and for the most part the subtle animation and good voice-acting make this a very pleasant series to watch.

And yes, these series do differ on the books for some part - Little My and Mymble for instance already knowing the Moomin family at the time of the first episodes, based on ""Finn Family Moomintroll"" (in which the two weren't present). The Snork has become an inventor, whose dearest ambition is to build a flying ship; a process that's followed through the entire series. Also certain characters from the comic strip get major roles, like the police inspector, one of my personal favourite characters. All in the benefit of these series, allowing it to stay close enough to the books but still allow it plenty of room to expand. And we mustn't forget that Tove Jansson herself wasn't always too strict on continuity with the books, either.

Because earlier DVD releases of these series were a fiasco, completely messing up the order and thus continuity of the episodes, I was immensely glad when Dutch company Telescreen took the first step into doing the thing properly. This is the first of intended future releases, and features, as said, 12 episodes. However, as a DVD set, it feels more home-made than a professionally-crafted release, both in picture and sound quality, while decent enough. Also there are no interactive menus on the first disc, and the order of episodes on disc 3 of 4 is messed-up (""The Hobgoblin"" should come before ""The Invisible Child 1"").

But these are also small flaws indeed and don't detract from the overall viewing experience. If you remember these series fondly like me, by all means get this set. Even if you aren't too fond of the Moomin books, you still might like these series. Whether they're drinking tea on the veranda or fending off frightening monsters, falling in love or outsmarting pirates, the Moomins and co are a charming sort as always. This is a nice place in which to get acquainted with them.",1193011200,38,3565,4.839344262295082
