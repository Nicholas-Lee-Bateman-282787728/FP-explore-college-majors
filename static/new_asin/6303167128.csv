His recent films, though, are a bit more Hollywoodized than his overlooked earlier ones.  The characters  in Home Sweet Home are so believable it's hard to believe that they're  acting.  None of them are the sharpest knife in the drawer, nor are they  better than plain looking.  In other words, they are real ""real  people.""  Which doesn't prevent them having interesting lives filled  with the same sadness and joy we all feel, without the shameless slathering  on and tear-jerking Hollywood can't seem to avoid.  If you're looking for  slice of life movies, you can't do better than this and other early Mike  Leigh movies like ""Nuts in May,"" ""Four Days in July,""  ""Hard Labor,"" ""Grownups,"" and ""Who's Who.""",938649600,11,828,4.773049645390071
