8081944,4,B000B5XSPI,WEF 8 & 9 are two of the best events of all time but many have never seen them.  Both events are packed full of UFC and international stars.,1301184000,,140,3.8275862068965516
8081945,4,B000B5XSPI,"The WEF was supposed to be (and was becoming) a major draw in the world of mixed martial arts. This event, ""World Class"", presents an excellent fight card, loaded with talent, stars of the present and future.

Jens Pulver displays his highly-touted striking ability with a crushing knee KO. The eccentric and soft-spoken Carlos Newton turns in a dominant performance (then acts like a fairy after the fight). Din Thomas further solidifies his status as a true lightweight world-class contender with a great fight.

Dave Menne and Jose ""Pele"" Landi go to war in a fight that goes the distance, but certainly not for any lack of action. This is a good one... Rich Franklin fights a hometown favorite who would be retiring that night: Gary Myers. Franklin is only 6-0 in mixed martial arts at the time, but he beats up on Myers like a seasoned and highly skilled veteran. This one has a good ending.

In a stunt that reminded me of the WWF, it was announced that Mark Kerr would be fighting in the WEF, Bobby Hoffman storms the ring in protest as Kerr is actually signing the ""papers"". The whole ordeal looks extremely staged and fake, but it was a nice attempt at drama.

Matt Hughes takes on the IVC Champ, Alexandre Barros. Hughes dominates on the ground, as usual, even delivering one of his trademark slams in the center of the ring. Conan Silviera and Dan Severn fight for the heavyweight championship. Silviera plants a deep guillotine choke on Severn early and almost ends it, but ""The Beast"" roars back and shocks the crowd...

This is a great event loaded with great fighters. I would definitely recommend checking it out. If you're a current UFC fan, you will enjoy seeing these future UFC stars working their way up the ladder early on in their careers.",1156896000,,1762,4.670967741935484
