8159415,1,B000KX0IL8,"I must first apologise for giving this movie such a high rating. The women in this movie should all try getting on ""What not to wear"". The first thing they would be told not to wear is a bikini, a one piece swimsuit with a ribbed corset underneath may give them the appearance of having a figure, as opposed to looking like bloated jellyfish. One women however did not quite fit into this generalization, if she were to be in profile as opposed to seeing her head on, you would justifiably think you were looking at a drag queen.

In short even if you were to buy the cheapest previously viewed version of this movie you would still be paying too much. This is definitely the reason FF button was invented. The only burning question in my mind at the end of this movie was - how much did these women have to pay to be in it.",1184716800,5,824,4.215189873417722
