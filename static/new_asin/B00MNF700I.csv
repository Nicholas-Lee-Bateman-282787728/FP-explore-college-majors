BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. This may be director Ridley Scott's masterpiece. The entire production and the culmination of what the team of filmmakers do is just incredible The cast is powerful giving performances that are both moving, yet very realistic and convincing. Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Sam Shepard, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner, Jason Isaacs, Orlando Bloom, George Harris, Ewen Bremner are just some of the impressive cast members. The film focuses on the 1993 raid into Mogadishu by the U.S. military to capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid and the complications of this military operation and the incredible intense battle that followed.

It often seems that moments of courage are a result of military expedience predilected by military ineffectiveness due to underestimated enemy strength and numbers and unexpected occurrences that put combatants face to face with overwhelming odds. How a general could ever let his men enter a maze-like city surrounded by thousands of hostile inhabitants is not entirely beyond comprehension. What you don't know or entirely understand or underestimate can hurt you. Sam Shepard as that general had to exceed the scope of the original mission and his command putting his men in harm's way in broad daylight. Simply, the initial mission as planned did not end up being cut and dry.

Ridley Scott seems uniquely capable of ferreting out the military decisions that led to this debacle but places no blame. However, all the blame is up there on the screen if you choose to take note similar to the way Sam Shepard watches it on his TV monitor. Scott instead places the viewer into a 180-degree maelstrom of bullets, bombs, shrapnel, blood, sweat and tears. In 160 years of technology it is amazing how some of the images are reminiscent of the last stand at the Alamo. What has been learned in all those years? Every good war film needs a hero and Tom Sizemore gives the best performance as one hardened and dedicated officer. The most interesting shot in this film is where a tired and weary group of Americans finally emerge from the city covered in dirt, gunpowder, blood and grease and they are greeted by foreign United Nations troops wearing turbans. These UN fellows offer the Americans glasses of water served from silver trays with white linen napkins draped over their arms. So much for modern technology it would seem.

This film is full of heroics of necessity and raw determination. It does not glorify war, but it does give dignity and recognition to those who go in harm's way to preserve our freedoms and ideals. A lot of the camera movement and Hans Zimmer's score emphasize this recognition to everyone involved at those right in the line of fire. BLACK HAWK DOWN is just a very good film, powerful all around.

BLACK HAWK DOWN is good. BLACK HAWK DOWN works simultaneously on both the broader canvas and on the personal level of the conflict. It gives great insight into so much of that incident and conflict. BLACK HAWK DOWN and TEARS OF THE SUN are timely and profound films.

When I first saw TEARS OF THE SUN it reminded me of those good old-fashioned Saturday matinee movies where it's the good guys against the bad guys and the odds are a thousand to one against. I really enjoyed it and I was particularly happy to see Bruce Willis come back with a good action packed adventure. Willis had these roles down to a science. It's some of what he does best. It's a non-stop shoot em up adrenaline rush. The action looks realistic and so does the gritty splattering of carnage.

Yet, there is a deeper side to TEARS OF THE SUN of human suffering and heroics where the humanity shines through what could have been just another action film. The images are powerful and I found Bruce Willis' performance one of his most sincere for a film in this genre. Each subsequent time I see this film it just seems better. The emotionally charged impact is devastating.

Both BLACK HAWK DOWN and TEARS OF THE SUN are both current and powerful films.",1418169600,2,4211,4.743169398907104
