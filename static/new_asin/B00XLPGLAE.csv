8716262,5,B00XLPGLAE,"Very Informative. Covers everything from safety to malfunctions and a little history on the 1911.  Interesting, I recommend this DVD whether you own a 1911 or not, but highly recommended if you own one.",1448323200,2,202,4.9411764705882355
8716263,5,B00XLPGLAE,"Overall, a good value. The quality of the production is superb with excellent audio and video.  Although the video focuses on the 1911, many of the techniques discussed are similar to those presented in official federal government courses.",1442188800,2,239,5.2894736842105265
