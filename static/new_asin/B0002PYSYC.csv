2115287,4,B0002PYSYC,"If you like old-timey Christmas movies, this is a sweet one. The three old gents are as endearing as can be.  Since Amazon's sight lacks a synopsis, I'll include one here:

A holiday gem released in 1940, this is a classic tale of three elderly gentlemen who foster the love of a young couple. Without families of their own to celebrate with on Christmas Eve, three rich businessmen (Harry Carrey, C. Aubrey Smith, and Charles Winninger) invite a kindergarten teacher (Jean Parker) and a rodeo performer (Richard Carlson) to share the holiday meal with them. Both of the young people had approached the men in an attempt to return a wallet they found, and they develop a friendship with their hosts while beginning to fall in love with each other. The three gentlemen are tragically killed in a plane crash, however, but return to their home in order to help the young people through the rough spots of their love. Becoming the couple's guardian angels, the ghosts guide their love to ensure that it will last forever in this charming and romantic holiday fantasy.

FYI, this was originally entitled ""Beyond Tomorrow.""",1099612800,101,1118,4.842931937172775
2115288,5,B0002PYSYC,"Beyond Christmas is a movie that shows us that God is constantly with us, not just at Christmas, but always.  He guides our lives through the kindness of our family and friends and those who love us.  This is a wonderful movie for the holiday season and beyond.

They don't make movies like this anymore, so curl up in front of the fire and enjoy this trip back to 40's.",1092096000,18,370,4.257142857142857

2115320,5,B0002PYSYC,"A very sweet old movie.  I sometimes think it's a mistake to colorize these old movies, they played with the shadows and the shades of grey to help dramatize the story and we color over it.  The story will drive the cynic straight to the arsenic but they won't make it past the first few minutes of the sound track, and why do we restore the film but leave the soundtrack un-restored?  Wouldn't it be nice if we all could just for one day try to be kind, try to see others in a better light.  I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet message of kindest to others and love so strong that it remains.  What's wrong with that?  If there is a here after it is almost for certain that it is the strong emotions like love and hate, steadfast and betrayal that are eternal and it's easy to see how that would create our own heaven and hell.",1512345600,3,823,4.177215189873418

2115360,3,B0002PYSYC,"Beyond Tomorrow, a lovely little film, was sadly allowed to lapse into the public domain, meaning that unrestored, bargain basement DVDs now abound. The best quality edition anywhere is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/US-region-1-VCI-DVD/dp/B00004Z4SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">US region 1 VCI DVD</a>. It has the sharpest, best condition and most complete print available.

After that you can take your pick from any of the other perfectly watchable public domain DVDs and collections, such as those by Alpha, Mill Creek, Elstree Hill, etc. Disregard any making spurious claims to be ""restored"": every single one of them comes from the exact same source, except for...

...The colorized version, retitled ""Beyond Christmas"" despite the fact that only the first third of the film has a Christmas setting. Released in several countries by 20th Century Fox, Legend Films, E1 Entertainment and others, unfortunately the title and palette aren't all they changed. Four scenes, originally cut for TV reissue and totalling five minutes, have been left out of the original 84 minute film and presented as ""deleted scenes"" in the meagre extras. This naturally spoils the flow of the film which is a real shame, as otherwise the print used is just a notch below the VCI's and slightly better than the one commonly in circulation. Like the VCI it has the last few seconds of the credits, which are missing from the other DVDs. It does, of course, also contain the original B&W version but that's edited too. A note about the colorization: more recent, post-1980s conversions can range from passable to extremely well done and virtually indistinguishable from film originally shot that way. However, as the source print used here is only of fair quality, the results are pretty poor. A YouTube search for ""Beyond Christmas (Beyond Tomorrow) (In Color & Restored) - Trailer"" will bring up a sample clip so you can judge for yourself.
Overpriced and incomplete, don't shell out over the odds for this version when the original uncut one can be had for literally pennies  or cents!

Overall then, if you're in the Americas or have a region free player, get the US VCI DVD. After that, all others are equal, but do ensure you avoid the colorized version... Happy viewing!",1493251200,,2304,5.269754768392371

Two out of three, did! A young, handsome, eligible bachelor - a singer, and a lovely, young, single lady. Hmm? Was it mere coincidence or could it be, fate?

The selfish, self-centered, pompous diva, who... due to her wealth, was used to getting her way regardless of the monetary cost or who she had too stomp on, in order to have complete and total control. And what happened to his former sweetheart/fiancee? The one who was faithfully 'in his corner' when he was starting out as a singer? The one he was going to marry?

2115454,5,B0002PYSYC,"This is one of the very few movies that Hollywood has chosen to release in the colorized mode on a DVD.  I suspect that there are only at most 20 that have been released colorized in the DVD format.  In the VHS era they released over 400 great old movies in the colorized mode.  And many were shown on commercial TV.  I have purchased almost all the (very limited) DVDs of colorized movies released by Hollywood.

It must be that the resolution for a DVD is far greater than was within VHS tapes so they need to re-colorized these if they are going to re-release them in the colorized mode and they don't want to risk the capital investment in so doing or let people have an alternative to the horrid garbage and pathetic low-classed actors out there today in the garbage movies they now release!  I have a collection of perhaps 80 or more colorized old movies only available colorized on VHS tapes and am always watching for one to show up or Hollywood to decide to release a great old Black & White movie in the DVD mode.  Until Hollywood releases these great old movies, I just run them thru the computer and put them on a DVD and live with the 400 lines of resolution available on the VHS tapes now on a DVD.  But it is pretty good as an alternative to an ultra clear movie of today's gargage being released today.

Today's movies are such garbage since the Supreme Court trashed the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 to 1967 and now the movies reek with blood, guts, perversion, profanity, sex, violance and are generally devoid of any/all redeeming social value and not healthy to watch especially by children!

This is one of the pre-1967 movies that has a wonderful story, makes you feel good watching it, and has a positive-uplifting affect on the viewer.  I have pretty much given up on the movies (term used loosely for completely worthless garbage) released today by hollywood.

To have movies like this in the colorized format provides a wonderful opportunity to enjoy them in a more natural mode that our eyes are used to.  And this movie was colorized so well that one would think it was filmed originally in Technicolor.

If you are a person looking for a wholesome movie (and don't concur with the Supreme Court trashing the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 to 1967) for you and your family, this is the movie for you!",1387756800,3,2346,4.528436018957346

2115470,4,B0002PYSYC,"""Beyond Christmas"" formerly known as ""Beyond Tomorrow"" displays the meaning of the Christmas holidays.  It is a film of timeless quality because of the message that is invoked with the characters and the main storyline.  For viewers familiar with RKO studios, they were known to produce many films emphasizing the human spirit, especially during one of the most pinnacle periods in Hollywood's history the 1940s during times of war and post war moments.  Although ""Beyond Christmas"" is not a war film, it is the message within the film of the kindness of strangers.

This is shown in the film with three businessmen Michael (Charles Winniger), George (Harry Carey), and Allan (C. Aubrey Smith) on Christmas Eve that await their dinner guests but only to welcome two strangers to their home an engineer named James ""Jimmy"" Houston (Richard Carlson) and Jean Lawrence (Jean Parker) that happen to meet on the street.  But little did they know that this would not be a chance encounter but one that goes beyond the eves of the holidays.  Just as viewers believe there will be a happy ending between the characters, tragedy ensues that involve Michael, George, and Allan, and misunderstanding between Jimmy and Jean.  And one cannot deny the parallels to this film to other films produced from 1940 to 1947, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" with the underlying meaning that focuses upon hope and to love on the home front, especially in this case in 1940 and World War II.  This is suggested in the storyline but also in the extra footage included on the DVD, two vintage promotional films, ""Jingle Bells"" that shows Bob Hope encouraging the public to buy Christmas Seals and the other film which is not titled involving war bonds.  In addition to the colorized version of ""Beyond Christmas,"" the original black and white version of the film and deleted scenes, and a short 22-minute film called ""The Christmas Star"" are included on the DVD.

For viewers that may not have heard of ""Beyond Christmas"" it is a film worth watching because of the interesting storyline, the characters, and timeless theme that has been shown in similar films.",1358726400,,2156,4.914600550964187

I had purchased a B&W one a couple years ago at a store; it did the same thing so I just thought it was a bad DVD.  Evidently not; it appears the original that is being used to make the copies is bad.

2115472,4,B0002PYSYC,"For the record, I do not work for Legend Films nor have any relatives or friends who do, so I am totally unbiased. This Beyond Christmas version does have a few shortcomings by Legend, but it's still a very good version since its colorized & includes a well-restored B/W! Plus Legend included lots of extra features & shorts! A few remarks:
1.) Beyond Christmas is a renamed & edited version of the full original called Beyond Tomorrow. This Beyond Christmas version has 6 minutes cut (79 vs. 85 original). However, Legend did put 5 of these cut 6 minutes back in as four Deleted Scenes. There is one scene that is still missing from Legend color & B/W versions, not shown in Deleted though. This completely-cut scene occurs at beginning of Scene 8 (29 minutes into film) when they all appear at girlfriend's workplace to bring presents to kids. This edited version cuts the first 22 seconds of them arriving, not a big loss of plot or story flow, though.
2.) Beyond Christmas, in both the color & B/W versions here by Legend, does have one other quirk vs. the 85-minute original. In the Legend version, the last 5 seconds of Scene 11 (where leading man walks up the stairs drunk while butler shakes his head) are then oddly repeated in Scene 12 (54 & 1/2 minutes into film during thunder booming segment) & are out-of-sequence. These 5 seconds do not repeat in original 85-minute version, so Legend goofed for some reason. The color is a little bit pastel-leaning in this movie also vs. Legend's later color results on other films, such as Legend's 2007 vibrantly-colorized ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Yet Beyond Christmas was colorized earlier than Wonderful Life, thus earlier colorization technology & it is understandable that colors lean towards pastel vs. being vibrant.
3.) All in all, I highly recommend Beyond Christmas by Legend Films if you want colorization & a well-restored B/W version!",1358035200,2,1898,4.825153374233129

Staring a delightful trio of character actors with long careers in film, Harry Carey, Aubrey Smith, and Charles Winninger, it may seem a mere vehical for these stars and probably was.  It also may seem somewhat light weight by modern standards, but it is still certainly a touching work, and far better than many ""made-for-TV"" holiday stories of more recent times.  I was taken by it immediately on first viewing.  It has since entered my 20 favorite holiday films collection, and I watch it every year.

The story partakes a little of both the filmography and the style of the Topper films that preceded it by a couple of years.  The attraction of the film for me is the affection between two generations, that of the late 19th century just giving up their claim on the world and that of the early 20th century that was just inheriting it.  There is a great deal of nostalgia involved, that for the audience for which the film was made of course, but also inadvertently for later audiences for whom the attitudes and mores of the time are things of history now.

A wonderful old film.",1292803200,2,1242,4.460176991150442

2115491,1,B0002PYSYC,"I'd give the actual film - originally titled ""Beyond Tomorrow"" - 3-4 stars.  It is a touching, sentimental, well-acted, well-directed, wonderfully scored little film about Life and Death and the bigger picture of both top priority topics.  It even brought tears to my eyes.  I highly recommend this film, although only the first fifth of it deals directly with the Christmas season.  Despite, LEGEND's retitling it to ""Beyond Christmas"" it is still extremely worth watching - but NOT the version released by LEGEND.

Oh, the cover of the DVD is beautiful!  The couple of ""Vintage Holiday Film Rarities"" are very brief appeals from Bob Hope and Bette Davis to buy Christmas seals to aid in the fight against TB and war bonds to aid in the World War Two war effort.  That's about it.  The trailers are for ""A Christmas Wish"" a.k.a. ""The Great Rupert"" and ....yes, ""Beyond Christmas""!  The inclusion of the ""restored black and white version"" of the main feature is totally pointless - and for this reason:  LEGEND actually had the guts to clip out 5 minutes of the full ""Beyond Tomorrow"" and add those deleted scenes as extras and claim them as ""Deleted Scenes.""  Yes - they were deleted from this print - by LEGEND  itself!  Why?  Just so the buyer believes he/she is seeing things left on the cutting room floor in 1940.  It just ain't so.  And it is especially pitiful because the film looks good in color - but what a shame that LEGEND can colorize the film decently...yet then go and chop-cut it just to add extras.

Get the movie, but not this purposefully truncated version.  I have the full film (84 minutes compared to LEGEND'S 79 minutes)as put out by Westlake Entertainment Group.  Believe me, five minutes might not seem like much - but they are CRITICAL scenes to the flow of the story - and to have to watch them afterwards under the bogus claim that they are ""Deleted Scenes"" is a small crime.  So before buying a version...make sure it runs 84 minutes.

LEGEND just ain't legendary...nor legit!  They did the same thing with the Seymour Hick's version of ""A Christmas Carol"" which I have reviewed elsewhere.  Shame on 'em!",1260921600,28,2135,4.695417789757412
2115492,1,B0002PYSYC,"To begin with, the one-star rating is for Legend, not the film.  The film itself is great.  After seeing the garbage they put out, I know to stay far away from anything they colorize.  I only looked at this to see the so-called original B&W version they had supposedly restored.  It was anything but original.  It's bad enough they stuck their own name on the film and changed the title.  Unbelievely, they actually edit scenes OUT of the film and call them deleted scenes.  Even with the colorized version on the disc, this would have been acceptable if the B&W version had not been changed also.  Colorization is a scourge which should be wiped off the face of the Earth.  What Legend did to this film and others is a travesty.  Get the VCI version for a complete film.",1243209600,7,771,4.482014388489208
2115493,5,B0002PYSYC,"While we don't typically associate B-movies (which this undoubtedly is) with creative and elaborate plots, good acting or quality special effects, Beyond Christmas challenges all of those assumptions and should give us all pause in our rush to prejudge a movie based on its budget.

The three Good Samaritan businessmen, all expertly played by their actors (Carey, Winninger, Smith) and full of warm, boisterous personality, play the role of matchmakers in this life and, following an unfortunate accident, in the next, guiding true love beyond the dire challenges that confront it.  Beyond Christmas, the colorization of Beyond Tomorrow, is a visual treat.  The special effects of the gentlemen's ghosts deserve special mention for being decades ahead of their time (and probably millions of dollars ahead of their budget).  The ""faded"" approach employed by the director works flawlessly, and I confess my own curiosity about how this accomplished during World War II.  I frankly never expected visuals that well-executed in something from 1940, and I was proven dead wrong.  The film's color, though the headline feature of this DVD, is not forced upon you, as you are presented with the choice of viewing the original black and white version as well.  The actual quality of the color varies from scene to scene, at times appearing as good as a Technicolor film, while at others appearing somewhat washed out.  Nevertheless, the quality of both versions is significantly better than what you're likely to find in a bargain bin, and for that reason this is probably the definitive Beyond Tomorrow DVD.

Special features include director's cut scenes (always a treat) and a collection of shorts about vintage holiday films.  Remember when Christmas was a genre, and not just a time to release another faceless blockbuster?  This latest edition of Beyond Christmas evokes those warm memories with its heartwarming story.",1228262400,2,1919,5.238562091503268

2115497,3,B0002PYSYC,"I was looking forward to this movie, as I am a fan of Christmas movies. As there are two versions on this DVD, I opted to watch the B&W first. The movie was heartwarming and charming, but there were obvious parts that the editing seemed somewhat off. Since this movie is in the public domain, I watched the original version at archive.org. What a difference!!! I'm sorry that Legend Films decided to edit this the way they did. They actually cut out 5 minutes of the film and added it to the DVD marked as ""deleted scenes"". How disappointing, since the ""deleted scenes"" really established some important points and made the ending more plausible. In addition, there is a point in the film where they messed up the editing and actually put a couple of seconds of a scene in twice, thus making one part of the film very confusing. How disappointing! My feeling is if you're going to colorize and otherwise tamper with these films, at least keep the editing in the original order that it was in! What's the point of cutting up a film and presenting it in this manner? Also, the color on this particular film wasn't very well done. It had that ""pastel smear"" type of effect applied and it was mostly distracting and not very appealing, like in some of their other efforts.

My recommendation would be to purchase another version of this movie. I have several other Legend Film DVDs that have been ""colorized"" just to see the various techniques used. This is certainly not one of their high points. I am glad they include the B&W with the color version, but tampering with the editing is where I draw the line. Purchase the 84 minute version. The colorization isn't worth it, as this movie plays better in B&W anyway. 4 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the format, average 3 stars.",1198368000,9,1776,4.55

Aubrey Smith, Charles Winninger) act as guardian angels to the couple, even before a plane crash takes their lives and they return to earth as ghosts to watch over them --- Jimmie's newfound success as a singer under the tutelage of the wanton divorced Arlene Terry (Helen Vinson) threatens his engagement to Jean, while the three ghosts try to keep the couple together --- They are involved in their own drama as each is called away to The Great Beyond--one to a bleak downward place because of some transgression in his past, the other to meet his son in paradise, and another who is doomed to ""wander the shadows of the earth"" because he gives up his chance at the Pearly Gates in order to lead Jimmie down the right path again --- the film ""BEYOND CHRISTMAS"" succeeds in striking a nice balance of heartwarming sentiment.

2115513,5,B0002PYSYC,"I liked most, that this movie was not a typical Christmas plot.  Three men whom are stood up by their Christmas guest decide to make a bet.  They each take a wallet with a $10.00 bill that were for gifts, and place a business card of their own inside of it.  They open the window and through all the wallets out onto what is a typical busy sidewalk during the holiday season.  They wanted to see if anyone would find and return the wallets.  Then they would invite this person to join in a Christmas Dinner.  Two of the wallets returned.  One from a young man and the other a young women.  It just so happens that both are away from home and family on this holiday season and accept the three mens offer of the Christmas Dinner. The group become great friends and spend all their time together, until a plane crash takes the lives of the 3 gentlemen whom had taken a business journey together.  The three men's spirits return to the house where they had always gathered to share a cigar or brandy.

Throughout the movie, one by one the heavens call and a loved one appears to show them the way to heaven.  All except one man who fights to stay a little longer to help the young couple through some trying times.  He sacrifices what is to be his one chance at going to the heavens above to stay behind and help the ones he loves through some trying times.  The rest you have to see for yourself.

2115514,5,B0002PYSYC,"With the release of this little known film from the 1940's, one can either curse or bless colorization.  Fortunately, this DVD offers both versions; I chose the colorized one, and although not perfect by any means, the colors give the movie a sort of cartoonish quality but still maintaining that grainy look of the forties.  Originally titled BEYOND TOMORROW, BEYOND CHRISTMAS is not a traditional Christmas movie, hence the reason perhaps for its unfamiliarity.  While opening at Christmas time, the movie actually chronicles the lives of two star crossed lovers and how their three benefactors struggle to keep them together when he becomes a famous crooner and falls into the clutches of his siren co-star.  The three kindly gentlemen are tragically killed in a plane crash but their ghosts return to make sure Jimmy and Jeannie stay together.  C. Aubrey Smith, Charles Winninger and Harry Carey are the three elderly gents; WOLFMAN's Maria Ouspenskaya is their Russian housekeeper; Richard Carlson (best known for CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) and Jean Parker are the lovers.  Admittedly hokey and at times mawkish, the movie nevertheless has a spirited storyline and resolves the tragedies by the end of the film.  This would be an odd little addition to your Christmas movies but an enjoyable one, whether you watch it in its original black and white format or choose the colorized version.",1134518400,11,1399,5.109649122807017
2115515,3,B0002PYSYC,"I think this movie (story wise) is worth watching.  However, I wish I had purchased a version with all scenes intact.  This version is 79 minutes and the deleted scenes only about 5 minutes.  I can't imagine why they felt it necessary to take out 5 minutes, especially because as I watched, it was obvious that scenes were being skipped.  After watching the deleted scenes, things made more sense and I felt the movie would have flowed better had they been left in.

If you are prone to cry at sad movies this one will probably get to you.  It's about three older well-to-do gentlemen that toss 3 wallets out their window on Christmas Eve to see if anyone is honest enough to bring them back.  Two come back, one via a young woman; the other a young man and romance ensues.  Sadly the trio that brought them together meet with a tragic death.  However, they then become guardian angels of sorts to the young couple.  I recommend this to those who like vintage movies but do also recommend watching the black and white version before the colorized.  I found myself distracted by the added fake color.

2115516,3,B0002PYSYC,"This is one of my favourite Christmas movies, originally released as ""Beyond Tomorrow"".  I love having this film in colour and I think they did a very good job of the colourization.  The B & W version is also available on the same disk.  My concern is that they took out parts of the movie, that were intact in the previous video release (probably so they could add more features), and included them as ""deleted scenes"".  The only problem is, that those scenes are in my opinion integral to the story line, particularly the set up for the climax.  The features are really good though and I especially enjoyed the commerical with Bob Hope.

Although I think this release could have been handled better by including the whole movie in one piece and a 2-sided disk instead, it is a wonderful story.  Three elderly gentlemen decide to throw their wallets out the window in hopes that they will find an honest soul to share their Christmas Eve dinner.  A young man and woman each return one of the wallets and become friends with the older gentlemen.  They fall in love only to find out that tragedy strikes.  The young couple have major problems of their own and Jimmy lets fame go to his head.  It takes the supernatural and Divine intervention to bring things back to a happy ending.  This story is also about the 3 gentlemen and their different approaches to life and how this effects their eternity.  It's a fairly complicated storyline with a good message.  It's really a good story for all year and especially at Christmas time.",1101686400,14,1530,4.597785977859779
2115517,2,B0002PYSYC,"This film is 1940's BEYOND TOMORROW, presented here as BEYOND CHRISTMAS in an edited version, removing several minutes of footage. Both colorized and B/W versions are included. The edited footage is presented as deleted scenes for some odd reason. The packaging states the film has been restored but don't believe it, it isn't a great print.

Instead of this, pick up the uncut BEYOND TOMORROW version for VCI. That version is a complete print with all scenes intact and in the correct place and is a much better print also.",1100822400,60,524,4.822222222222222

While there are a few things that I didn't necessarily like, I found it to be thought provoking and much more enriching than your average Hallmark movie.  It emphasizes  friendship, temptation, man's depravity, and God's mercy.",1514851200,,352,4.369230769230769

8030606,2,B0002PYSYC,"The first 20-30min of this movie looks like a set up for a charming albeit predictable and likely cliched tale about Christmas and the value of human relationships. About ten minutes in I actually stopped the movie to call my husband in to watch it.

Then, about half-way through, it all started to fall apart. Suddenly we have ghosts and vamps and hastily established plot devices interspersed with some of the most maudlin and vague religious twaddle I've ever heard. My advice? Cut the movie off after the Christmas day celebration. You'll have seen all the good parts without having to sit through a rapid and ill-conceived succession of vamps, jealous ex-husbands, near death experiences, prescient housekeepers, and the voices from the sky. All the little bits of character that were established in the first 30min are abandoned and replaced with boring plot filler.",1514505600,,872,5.055555555555555

You won't regret the time spent to watch this now on my favorite classics list!  :) Merry Christmas 2017",1514332800,,319,4.678571428571429
8030608,5,B0002PYSYC,"I am always thrilled to discover a wonderful old movie. This one fits the bill. Simple, old fashioned movie making at it's finest. Wonderful characters. I'm sure that I would have enjoyed it every bit as much in black and white. Somehow these old films are able to pull off being fanciful without being silly. Sure, no major stars, but the performances are solid. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1514160000,,388,4.720588235294118
8030609,3,B0002PYSYC,"As old Christmas movies go this one is about as good as they come.  Not up to the quality as some of the more popular ones but what I like about this one is it does deliver a Christian message unlike some of the others.  Some complain about the quality of the movie and they are right, it is of a rather poor quality and the sound is bit messy in parts but with subtitles turned on it runs perfectly.  I enjoyed it from the point of view that it cover Christian values of living a proper life.",1514160000,3,493,4.010204081632653
