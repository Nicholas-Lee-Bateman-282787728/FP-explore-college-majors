6291161,3,B00ISZNCRC,"This dvd is only about 20 or so minutes long.  However my son watches it constantly.  It's set during the time of their first winter holiday celebration after making peace with the dragons. However, I don't know why it is available for pre-order when you can walk into walmart and purchase it for like $5.",1399680000,2,305,4.527272727272727

8645165,5,B00ISZNCRC,"I loved this short film! It was cute and funny.
In this 20 min. film, we find the Vikings preparing for Snoggletog (their Christmas). Suddenly their dragons take off and, of course, Hiccup is the one to discover the reason.
We see a deeper connection between Toothless and Hiccup, and Astrid and Hiccup ;)
I didn't pay $20+ but even if I had, I wouldn't complain. This film was worth it to be. But then again, I'm obsessed with all things How To Train Your Dragon :D",1410998400,3,466,4.367816091954023
