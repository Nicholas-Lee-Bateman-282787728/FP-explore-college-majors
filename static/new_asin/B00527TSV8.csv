4528808,4,B00527TSV8,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every half-hour episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about Kidnapping Cases. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. A Bag of Evidence: The Abduction and Murder of 9 years old Jessica Knott, in 1996.
2. Best Foot Forward: The Abduction and Murder of Shamia Smith.

4528849,4,B00527TSV8,"There are a couple of episodes in here that actually end sort of happily. That was a nice surprise. The variety of forensic science areas used is quite nice. The recurring theme tended to be trace evidence though. With shows like this, it's always a mild letdown to have the cases covered be mostly from the mid 80's or 90's, but Forensic Files does an excellent job of showing you the case, the evidence, and a few of the people involved without dragging things out unnecessarily.

Shari's case shows up in the ""Best of"" Forensic Files collection. That one was especially neat because it brings up document examination.",1345852800,3,620,4.7407407407407405
