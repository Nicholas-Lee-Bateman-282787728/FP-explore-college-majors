What you will instantly recognize is the vivid colors, pristine lakes, clouds moving rapidly across the sky and over mountains, lightening storms, misty lakes, majestic waterfalls, rainbows, gorgeous swans, funny ducks and even Bison to put on a show.

One scene seems to last five minutes and then another scene, the same thing happens. It is a pretty scene but they held it too long for visual comfort. Also on the lower right hand side a website address is prominently featured causing a bit of a distraction. Your eyes keep dropping to see the words instead of focusing on the beauty of the natural settings.

Now and then you can hear water sounds like from waterfalls. Bird noises are also prevalent in some scenes.

Some of the scenes I really liked included an orange sunset and hoses grazing on grassland.

So it was very relaxing and I'm listening to the music in the background and trying not to fall asleep. It is that good. Best for
watching at night right before bedtime. Will knock you out.

8165391,3,B000LZ59KA,"This production is decidedly misnamed and misleading. I love what is in it because Greater Yellowstone is my favorite place on earth, and especially the Grand Tetons. However, that's ALL which is in this film. It is not the Rocky Mountains per se but just that little region of them. Most of it is shot in Grand Teton National Park. It does not depict the Cascades of the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Northern Cascades National Park and Olympic National Park), the High Sierras in California/Nevada, nor the Colorado Rockies such as Rocky Mountain National Park, Pike's Peak, the spectacular drive on I-70 west of Denver or the breathtaking San Juan Mountains in the southwest. None of the vast mountains of western Montana or northern Idaho appear. Nor does it include the Canadian Rockies, such as in Banff, Jasper or Kootenay National Parks, or the mountains of Alaska, which would include Mount McKinley (Denali). I would have acquired it all the more readily had it been titled accurately but be forewarned if you are looking for something which covers all of the Rocky Mountains generally. This isn't it. It does have great cinematography and a soothing music overlay, and is a great exposition of Grand Teton National Park.",1407542400,2,1226,4.956310679611651

However, not your mistake, more a case of ""look better"" before you purcahse next time.

Will appreaciate it if you can let me know if this DVD is available as a HD DVD?
