8052174,5,B0007V9J9A,"From 1975: Show #1 has Tim Conway as guest (before he became a regular). Included: A ""family"" sketch has an injured Mama (Vicki) recuperating in Eunice & Ed's (Carol, Harvey) home after a nasty spill...and then proceeds to get on their last nerves; the ""oldest man"" (Tim) is a hospitalized witness to a crime, with a cop (Harvey) trying vainly to get information from him (Tim's physical comedy here is astounding); Carol & Vicki perform the lively song ""Mama's Got A Date"" (originally aired on an earlier show); a wishing well spells trouble for a couple (Carol, Harvey); a clever sketch about two robbers hitting the same cashier (Tim); and a musical Egyptian Nile finale.
From 1976: Show #2 is a ""family"" show; no guests, just regulars. Included: Another ""family"" sketch has Ed looking forward to a weekend of convention fun...that is, until it's revealed that Ed chooses friend Mickey (Tim) to come along instead of wife Eunice; the Ernest Flatt dancers in a ""baby"" number; a last-minute dictation from dumb blond secretary Mrs. Wiggins (Carol) turns into another exercise in exasperation for boss Mr. Tudball (Tim); a round of the game ""honesty"" gets out of hand for a couple (Carol, Harvey); and a poignant change-of-pace finale allows the show to look back fondly on a few of its great moments. The iconic ""cleaning lady"" character closes out by singing Carol's signature song.
If you're looking for a volume where the regulars run the whole show, then this is the one!",1252886400,3,1476,4.884462151394422
