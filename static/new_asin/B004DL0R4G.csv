4332675,3,B004DL0R4G,"If you are a wrestling purist, you will enjoy this documentary -- good commentary from those that dream of making it big.  If you are expecting ""The Circus"", ""Living with Shadows"", etc., you will be disappointed.",1325635200,,212,4.888888888888889
4332676,3,B004DL0R4G,"This documentary is alright. It features a few insider issues that all indy wrestlers deal with, but it also doesn't really hit on anything other than one section of the indy scene. For a documentary, it was a good romp through the motions of wrestling and what indy guys go through on a day-to-day basis. But for a wrestling documentary, it left too many things out, and left on a sour note (in my opinion).

If you're just getting into wrestling, don't watch this quite yet. This is a gritty, but realistic, view of what they go through. But it's not done in the most professional of ways.",1321920000,,591,4.472222222222222
4332677,5,B004DL0R4G,"I heard a few people raving about this film so i thought i'd check it out, and it far surpassed my expectations. I'm not a wrestling fan but found the film gripping and captivating through-out - it's a unique viewpoint, and it's brilliantly executed. Wrestling fans will no doubt be attracted as it features some big names, but non-fans like myself will also find it enjoyable, and perhaps make them look at the sport with more of an open mind. I highly recommend it! 5 stars!",1310601600,5,476,4.546511627906977
4332678,4,B004DL0R4G,"Short Review: Hard Knock's is a well made documentary and while not as impressive as Beyond the Mat it is enjoyable to watch and I would recommend it to anyone as although it's a British video, the story is the same across North America.  I would have liked for the documentary to run longer than it did and felt I wanted more so with it coming in at just 40 minutes I did find myself hit the repeat button straight away because I wanted to see it again.  If your interested in a behind the scenes look at wrestling that isn't a WWE or TNA production then this is something I would suggest you check out.",1305590400,,604,4.198275862068965

8425570,1,B004DL0R4G,First off the video I rented has some horrible audio problems. Some of the audio is clear and some you can't hear at all. Now this is a problem when the movie consists of 50% interviews. This movie is only 38 minutes long. It'll show wrestlers training and have a bunch of Indy wrestlers in it. There's some nonsensical clips. Honestly this movie was a waste of money,1411862400,,367,4.411764705882353
8425571,2,B004DL0R4G,I read alot of good reviews about this and to be honest..I don't know why. It gets kinda boring but it isn't very long.,1368230400,,119,4.0
8425572,5,B004DL0R4G,"REALLY enjoyed this. Should be made mandatory viewing for all those people who dismiss wrestling as a valid form of entertainment, for it being predetermined. Hard Knocks gives a good look into the psychology of a wrestling match, as well as what goes behind the doors of a wrestling school. What pretty shocked by some of those interviews on the street at the end!",1367884800,,365,4.71875
8425573,4,B004DL0R4G,"I liked this video as it delves into the training of becoming a pro wrestler. It shows that the lifestyle is not lavish, and that it takes a huge amount of effort to become successful.",1367366400,,184,4.285714285714286
8425574,4,B004DL0R4G,Not the greatest wrestling documentary but it is a good one. Really shows a lot of the hard work it takes to make it in the business but also show the stigma's that indie wrestlers have to deal with from the public.,1353456000,,215,4.142857142857143
8425575,3,B004DL0R4G,not what i expected but not all Bad. Mostly international and Ungeard of Performers with the exception of D-Lo Brown and Al Snow,1351382400,,128,4.608695652173913
8425576,2,B004DL0R4G,"This DVD sucks even for a wrestling fan. Its very cheaply made, and you can't understand what the wrestlers are saying and talking about because of the bad audio. They make the DVD extras sound great but don't be fooled. All they are is a one-on-one conversation with the wrestlers and its info the wrestling fan already knows. On the Hardcore Holly interview you can hear a train in the background and once again the audio is horrible on these interviews. The only good thing on this DVD is the ""Road Dogg"" interview, the rest is junk. The star wrestlers they use on the writing and back of the cover aren't even in the documentary. They just used ""Raven"" and a couple others on advertising this DVD so it would sell.  Its very short and not worth the money.",1345075200,5,759,4.460431654676259
8425577,1,B004DL0R4G,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE I KNOW AND OR RESPECT. GARBAGE IS MORE ENTERTAINING!,1341187200,,153,6.0
