There were also another sister commented on that it is looked on as good for men to  have premarital affairs as much as possiable but women are loked down on if they do .After this comment was made a statement fallowed from the muslim sister that women i to do but they just don't speak of it ! These are things which should be known and made open amongst the muslim community so we may improve as Muslims and bring our Muslim Man an Muslima(Muslim Woman) togethor in the purest form to show the world that ISLAM is the best way of life to live for the humanbeing if lived according to what ALLAH(SWT) commanded !""DO whatever is easy"" and Allah will do te rest, Assalamu Alaikum !",1259971200,3,898,4.22093023255814

A must have for anyone who is interested in expanding their conciousness of women and Islam through the perspective of Muslim women themselves.",1131062400,5,317,4.814814814814815
