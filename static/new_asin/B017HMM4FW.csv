7505172,2,B017HMM4FW,"At a forensic testing body farm in Wyoming, New York a doctor injects a serum into the cadavers creating half the title.  While there have been Bigfoot sightings in New York, Wyoming County has been light on them.

If you have ever seen a Polonia Brothers film, then you know they love big rubber masks in lieu of complex make-up. After all it is easier to get the mask looking the same if you have to do a second take, something I believe they don't know they can do. Their films are always cheesy with bad local ""actors."" On the Polonia Brothers scale this rates less than ""Queen Crab"" but better than ""Saurians."" Think of this as a lower tier Rene Perez of the East Coast. The Bigfoot costume looked too small for the character so they used spray foam to seal it.

So bad it is bad.

7505173,4,B017HMM4FW,"NOT a big-budget studio blockbuster. Not even a small-budget film, and clearly no studio was involved. Definitely a niche film. You have to know that going in. Polonia Brothers Entertainment, namely the films of director Mark Polonia, represents a tradition of no-budget film-making reaching back to the 1980s, when Mark and his late brother John were making 8mm films in their backyard. This is not a studio producing blockbuster films, it's a group of friends in rural Pennsylvania continuing to hone their craft any time they can get a weekend open to go shoot. It's like Roger Corman without all the budget, shooting time, and production quality. I've been a fan of these films since 2008, and I've seen them cover subgenres including monsters, ghosts, vampires, werewolves, killer fish, dinosaurs, Bigfoot, aliens, and numerous others. This film actually represents one of the better PBE pictures in terms of a complete and compelling story, and interesting cinematography, though it is still obvious that absolutely no budget was available and it was made in available locations, with friends and family, and not seasoned movie stars.

I could not recommend this film to just anyone -- it's not that kind of film. It will primarily appeal to 3 types:
1. Fans of Polonia Brothers Entertainment films. You've been along for the ride, you're going to stick around for the next one, and the next one.
2. ""So Bad It's Good"" film viewers who get together to ironically watch ""bad"" films. It's an easy target. Get some popcorn and go nuts.
3. Amateur or professional film makers who enjoy the process of making a film, even someone else's film, even someone else's tiny, super-cheap film, as much or more than the film itself. The DVD includes a director/DP commentary and a making of featurette.",1456876800,5,1795,4.983333333333333

Every ""Errr"" was pronounced with depth, every ""Arrrg"" was breathtakingly realistic. The last time I heard such agonizing sounds was when I slipped in my shower...

And the humans - well - they left me as speechless as the stumbling zombies. Even with minimal dialog and plots that kept me on the edge of my seat. This brought back memories of the time I was hiking on Kauai, and almost slipped off a cliff in the rainstorm. Meaning, I had no idea if I would live through the next devastating twist...

7505222,1,B017HMM4FW,"The movie started out with a little promise and then was washed away in everything bad with these types of movies. Basically chemicals get released in a FBI facility that leaves bodies to decompose and agents can study them. Zombies arise (some of the dumbest looking zombies you will ever see. One looks like it has a wig snatched from a tranny and others look like a small handful of grey face paint was unevenly applied.)

A bigfoot (the ""costume"" looks like about 4 different costumes were used) is lurking in the woods and somehow manages to climb in the back of a jeep to sneak into the facility...in broad day light and both a security guard (one of the worst actors in recent memory) and the hunter manage to not notice.

More of the worst looking zombies you will see attack more bad actors and finally bigfoot manages to fight some of them and help 2 of the better actors in this flick. Somehow they are able to communicate, a fresh zombie is able to use keys and talk. The movie threatens us with a sequel.

I wish the Polonia's would throw a little more care into the story and effects (the Xeroxed porn mag called ""Thugs and Juggs"" isn't funny and looks stupid and the rags dipped in blood for intestines look incredibly lame.)

8739267,3,B017HMM4FW,"As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

While watching a slew of low budget horror and sci-fi movies recently (all reviewed on Amazon) I saw the film Muckman -- a team-up of Pennsylvanias low-budget twin-brother directors the Polonias (one of the brothers is now deceased) and low-budget special effects mastermind Brett Piper.  The film was lacking in a number of ways but had cool old-school stop-motion effects (courtesy of Brett Piper), and also had a little T & A. It was a good time overall.  It introduced me to both the Polonias as well as Piper.

Bigfoot Vs. Zombies is directed by the lone remaining Polonia twin, Mark Polonia. Minus Brett Piper on special effects duties, the effects in Bigfoot are not only not as good as those in Muckman, they are  despite Polonias history making horror/ sci-fi films  more makeshift than I would have expected.  Pretty much what you would expect if your neighbor made a horror film. The film is also short the T & A thrills of Muckman.

What keeps this film from sinking to a lower than 3 star rating is Polonias ability to pull decent performances out of his cast of actors/non-actors. Dont get me wrong  Youre not going to mistake the cast of Bigfoot Vs. Zombies for classically trained actors, but Ive now seen many of these same actors in two films directed by Brett Piper (Muckman and Queen Crab) where they came across less well than they do in Bigfoot Vs. Zombies.

Polonia also composes his shots well, and uses a roving camera to good effect  the sort of camera move you see when an actress is running through the woods and the camera is weaving around trees following her.",1486425600,,1746,4.673202614379085

8739271,2,B017HMM4FW,"We have a film appreciation association here in the city of Rochester called FilmFail, which constantly watches various films and is always on the look out for gems.  This film is not one of them.  We rate each film: Presentation (1-5), Originality (1-5), and Taste (1-10) and then figure that average:  This movie scored a total of 5... If it wasn't for the fact that the movie is actually the first of it's kind where we see a sasquatch battle the undead, it would probably have fallen to a 3...

Roughly 3/4 of the film could be called ""Bigfoot Voyeur Zombies"" as the comically bad monkey suit, with what seems like gorilla chests on it's front and back for some odd reason, merely stares out from behind the shrubs as painfully bad made up zombies shamble around spreading ketchup on hapless victims.

They don't even stick with a uniform concept of zombies. There are scenes where zombies are talking, while others are pouring gas and starting fires with flares, but then unable to turn a door knobs to get the humans...

During the entire film you will find yourself muttering 'WTF', which starts off quietly, then eventually you are shouting at the film. This is one of those instances where the film should have been shot in the dark to possibly hide lack of skill in effects, but instead seems like the entire cast and crew could squeeze in shooting on their lunch breaks and on weekends when their buddy's doctor's office was not in use.

 This movie is pretty unbearable to watch... Unless of course this was made and directed by a young teenager for his first film, wherein he had his family and friends act and make the props... if that is the case, then kudos to you, keep on trying...
But if an adult actually tried to make a good film and this is the result, I would suggest you change the name on the credits to alan smithee and never speak of it again.",1477612800,3,1870,4.511834319526627
