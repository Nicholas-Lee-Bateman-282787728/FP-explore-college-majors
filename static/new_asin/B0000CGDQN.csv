7999385,5,B0000CGDQN,I like this video because this documentary is great!,1506556800,,52,4.888888888888889
7999386,5,B0000CGDQN,If you love traveling and you love mountain scenery this is a fun 60 minute snapshot of vintage railroading in a beautiful mountain setting. Watching this brought back memories of my trip on this railroad many years ago. The history of the railroad is given while the trip takes you to places that are inaccessible to roads. It whet my appetite to go back again.,1396137600,,362,4.584615384615384
7999387,1,B0000CGDQN,"Poor narriation, worse planning, trains up, trains down, trains up, trains down, trains up, fair photography, best watched on fast foward",1390089600,,137,5.571428571428571
7999388,5,B0000CGDQN,"I bought the original when it was on beta max format.  The supplier had supplied an excellent copy.  Clear, no flaws,",1382486400,,117,4.523809523809524
7999389,5,B0000CGDQN,"Beautifully put together. Been there, refreshes the memories. Sound and video quality well worth watching. Grandkids ask to watch the choo choo. Hope someday to take them to enjoy in person. If you have a desire to watch a movie that is entertaining and informative this is one that offers a great opportunity.  Just sad this is not available on CD.",1341360000,,349,4.721311475409836
7999390,2,B0000CGDQN,"I purchased this video because I thought the sound quality would be decent and that the video quality would be OK.  Instead the sound quality is similar to that of a telephone.  Ever had someone call you while they are standing next to a steam engine or at a fireworks show and say 'gee doesn't that sound great !"" ?

Although not suitable for an adult collection the most expensive ($30) DVD I have ever bought will be warmly welcomed into my 4 year old's collection right next to Thomas.",1094515200,2,489,4.411111111111111
7999391,5,B0000CGDQN,"AFTER VIEWING THIS PRODUCERS' EARLIER RELEASE ON THE CUMBRES & TOLTEC, I COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THIS ANNOUNCED RELEASE.  THE WAIT WAS WELL WORTH IT.  NARRATION IS MINIMAL (DISC CAN BE PLAYED WITHOUT NARRATION), LETTING THE ENGINES AND SCENERY DO THE TALKING.  THIS PRODUCERS VIDEOGRAPHY IS EXCELLENT+, PROVIDING DIFFERENT AND VARIED VIEWS FROM MOST OTHER PRODUCTIONS I HAVE SEEN ON THIS SUBJECT.  PRODUCTION QUALITY IS HIGH, CLEARLY EVIDENT THROUGHOUT.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1065052800,5,472,5.591549295774648
