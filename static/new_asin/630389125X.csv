7856044,4,630389125X,"I do like this DVD for teenagers, it is engaging and good information.  However......  There are other DVDs on the topic I like even better.  Mary Beth Bonacci treats the topic lovingly and gently, but Pam Stenzel's Sex, Love And Relationships DVD is more hard-hitting and my preference.  Most teenagers need to have a more direct and tough talk, I think.  Ellen Marie had a good VHS but you can't find it anymore - Reality in Relationships.  Looks like Pam has more DVDs that are recent, should be good also.",1471564800,,509,4.6

7856046,3,630389125X,"I bought this video for my two teenage grandkids. Before showing it to them, I watched it. This video was made in 1995. Overall, I think it provides good information and is quite representative of the time when it was produced.

There may already be an updated version. If not, I think an updated version must include more information about the challenges and temptations today's teens face such as the Internet, social networks and pressure from their peers.

Of course, a video can't take the place nor teach the lessons that should be taught by parents long before the teen years. I think the video can be a valuable resource to use to start ""the"" conversation between parents and teens. However, parents should be ready to add much more to the dialogue.",1314316800,,757,4.7272727272727275
7856047,5,630389125X,"I first saw this talk as a young teenager and was completely taken in.  In a dynamic, spiritual and logical way Bonacci makes a great, teen relavent, argument for chastity.  One of the great things about this talk is that it blends the Christian spiritual reasons for chastity with the logical and even scientific reasons for it as well. Though it is a bit dated, the talk is timeless and brilliant.  In college, I watched it again with my roomate (she had never seen it) and she and I enjoyed it just as much the second time maybe even more.",1206489600,,542,4.4
7856048,3,630389125X,"I realize this speaker is talking to high school student so she often uses humor and voices to reach out.  When you get past that, she has some very valuable insight and thought provoking information regarding teenagers and the pressures to be sexual.  She is coming from a Christian perspective but her message provides good advice for all teenagers.",1196726400,,351,4.932203389830509
7856049,5,630389125X,"Parents encourage teenagers to abstain from sex but don't give them reasons they they will actually consider. Don't many teens think, ""I won't get pregnant..."" This video tells them why they should be  chaste.  She gives teens reasons why they should wait until marriage.  She  explains using language they'd easily understand and puts forth an argument  which teens & young adults will consider and not blow off.  I'm not a  Mother (yet) but I will remember this video whenever I have to have  ""the talk"".",952905600,17,506,4.870588235294117
