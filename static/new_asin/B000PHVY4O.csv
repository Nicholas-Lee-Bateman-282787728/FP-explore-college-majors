The cast is pretty good and carries the movie only so far. The scenes of dirt bike racing are pretty cool even for those not into the sport such as myself and keeps the viewer involved when the movie drags abit. The story evolves around two brothers who are the dirt bike racer galans. The older brother has a bike accident in the past so he doesn't race anymore but battles pain and flashbacks throughout the movie. The younger brother is a wild stud and a bit of a hot head but he's carrying the family name all the way to Las Vegas to ride in a championship race. They leave home and a father who is a gambler and has lost it all so maybe the grand Las Vegas prize will restore the family name. Along the way the ride from Mexico to Las Vegas, the road is full of adventure of the biking kind once they encounter a young Marianne, played by Ximena Sarinana, who is a tom boy looking for her her father who was a motocross racer too! Fits nicely into the plot, right? Three people on the road to discovery in a truck with camping gear; let the fun begin. There are a few obstacles to overcome along the way and so it is an adventure,sport-action,romance movie that is fun. If you are into dirt bike riding you might enjoy this low budget Mexican movie; the visuals of racing are pretty sweet. It is an average movie but I would give it an overall C+ because the racing action scenes help.",1360713600,,1510,4.246527777777778
