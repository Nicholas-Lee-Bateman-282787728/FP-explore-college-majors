832597,4,6304286384,"What an intriguing, beguiling tale.  It is a study in sexual awakening for a young woman, seduction by an older, experienced man, and cultural tension  between East and West. Would any American director know how to present  this marvelous sensuality in such frank, yet beautiful images?  My partner,  who has been so very leary of on-screen sexuality, loved it! And so did I.  One of the few films I have chosen to purchase for future screenings.  If  my review strikes a note, be sure to get the unrated version.",916185600,5,513,4.685393258426966

833116,5,6304286384,"Jane March gives an Oscar caliber performance as ""the girl"" in this Oscar caliber screen rendition of the autobiographical novel of the same name written by French author Marguerite Duras. No need for me to repeat the fine synopses already written about this grossly under rated movie (when it was released). In addition to the rendition of the novel and the acting of Jane March, production, direction, cinematography, editing, lighting, sound, and the exceptional over narrative by Jeanne  Moreau are also Oscar caliber. This movie, and Miss March, got panned by puritanical critics in 1992, because of 2 sex scenes, and it has taken far too long for The Lover to finally be getting the accolades it has so long deserved.",1479945600,3,723,4.975206611570248

833118,3,6304286384,"Teenage girl doesn't realize how involved she's getting with an older man until he's married someone else. Interesting, but a) the romanticism is too superficial, built mostly on sex scenes that are erotic, but don't do much to reveal what's going on inside the characters; and b) not enough happens to develop the young protagonist's psyche. She is simply unaware of what's going inside her for most of the two hours. An interesting film, slow, but very engaging visually. Its flaw is that it lacks psychological depth.",1477872000,,520,4.988505747126437

833120,5,6304286384,"""The Lover"" is a nice example of early 90's erotica. Released in 1992 to mostly negative reviews, it was lambasted by most critics as being shameless softcore porn with no story and that it also exploited star Jane March who was barely 18 years old at the time of filming and spent a good portion of her scenes completely nude. Based on the semi-autobiographical 1984 novel by Marguerite Duras, the film details the illicit affair between a teenage French girl (Jane March) and a wealthy Chinese man played by Tony Leung in 1929 French Indochina. When originally released, there was much controversy on if the explicit sex scenes were simulated or not. 6 to 7 body doubles were used for Jane March in certain shots. The US release was also problematic as the film had to be severely cut by 13 minutes to avoid an NC-17 rating but was released fully uncut eventually on VHS and DVD.

I have always felt this film was very underrated and while not a classic like ""Last Tango in Paris"", it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as other fine pieces of cinematic erotica. The acting is great from the two often exposed leads (though there is no full frontal male nudity but plenty of female), the setting well defined and historically accurate and the numerous sex scenes well filmed, erotic & explicit while stopping short of being pornographic as no penetration is shown (with the exception of one quick often debated shot involving French female & male body doubles). There isn't much story to speak of but that isn't the point of the film. It is about mood and sexual awakening. Fans of Jane March will also find a lot to like here too. She looks amazing throughout. I should also mention that this is the full uncut 116 minute version of the film.

While never having been released yet on bluray here in North America, Germany got a very nice region free bluray of the film in NTSC format with the extras including an informative making of featurette being in PAL format so make sure you have a bluray player that can decode PAL to NTSC should you want to check those special features out.

The film is presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio (though it was intended for a 1.66:1 ratio but the difference is negligible) and looks superb. Detail is immaculate with flesh tones looking accurate which is important considering the amount of flesh on display in this film. No digital scrubbing was done so it features a nice filmic grain stucture. Audio is featured in lossless audio and in English too. Fans of the film and stunningly gorgeous actress Jane March would do wise to import this superb bluray release.",1472256000,9,2613,4.639308855291577

833311,3,6304286384,"Jane March does a good job in the role of teenage girl exploring the power her youth, beauty, and newfound womanhood have over men - one man in particular. It's set in 1920s French Indochina, cosmopolitan for its time but with deepset prejudices about intimacy between races. As a result, different roles blur together - the girl's romantic notion herself as siren, whitewashed ideas of sex for money, social barriers and a departure date setting strict limits on the relationship, the good and bad of relationships, and her Chinese lover moving between Eastern and Western worlds.

Somehow, this never rose to the movie it could have been for me. The girl's flat emotional expression didn't help, nor did a sound track so full of background sounds that conversation became hard to follow. Mildly amusing to watch once, something more lasting will take its place in my DVD library.

833403,2,6304286384,"I would never have been intrigued by this story if it wasn't for Jane March's gorgeous compelling face.  She is the reason why I read the book, then I saw this film; her face is that captivating.

This isn't a perfect film, and I was very perplexed by her character.  Her family is interesting.  They are French, living in what is now known as Vietnam, and they should be elevated only they are living in poverty.  Her mother is a broken school teacher - hapless and well-worn, and beholden to the greedy needs of her eldest child.  The girl's older brother is a spendthrift, a bully, gambler, selfish, cruel, insecure, and weak; and the other brother is far weaker, though possessing none of those betraying traits.  Coming from that, you understand why she was beckoned by the magnificent black limousine, and the elegant gentleman standing by it.  Her audacity of approaching - and then kissing the car window - what does she want - what was she inviting?

You understand why she is drawn to him/the lover/Tony Leong, though she may not be attracted.  She is not attracted, but she presents herself - fully, openly, honestly.  She receives immense sexual pleasure though historically, traditionally, and stereotypically she isn't supposed to.  But she does not care.

The film is gorgeously shot, and there are precious, powerful moments, and I will say that despite Jane March's lack of experience, she was better than most veteran actresses I have seen.  She gave her body fully, and there is an exquisite innocence in her lack of shame.

Still, this isn't a perfect film.  There are numerous flaws, and it could have been better.  But does its lack of perfection add to the richness and depth of the film?  Maybe.  But sometimes, all I could see were the holes.

The film is profoundly sexy.  But this film could have been tighter, better, greater - that is what I mourn.  The book was flawed but there were moments of greatness.  This film had that potential.  But it betrayed it for sentimentality.

Honestly, I don't think the film believed in itself.",1443916800,2,2060,4.751412429378531

833509,5,6304286384,"I remember taping this movie from cable in the 1990s. I liked it so much that I would later buy the DVD and read the book. A rarity for me. I'm proud to be able to be the 204th person to review this fine film.

Racism and ignorance play a major part of this film. We see how a Chinese man in 1929 will never be able to marry a white woman and we see how a white woman is considered a ""slut"" for having an affair with a man of a different complexion than her. The stigma that Jane March's character undergoes (Ostracized By Her Peers) is sad and by our modern standards shocking.

We see how the dysfunction of her family may well have led to her attempting to gain love and affection from an older man. What's not discussed in too much detail is the fact that by today's standards the older Chinese man would be considered a child molester. Statutory rape is a serious crime in America. and even though Jane March was over the age of 18 when filming began I can bet that some theatres in prudish America would not show this film. March's character was 15 and a half when she began her affair.

The sex scenes in this film are nothing short of spectacular! Perhaps the best I've ever seen shot on a mainstream Hollywood or European film widely released in theatres (Not Adult In Other Words). How Jane March was able to showcase this was fantastic. We must remember that she was still a kid herself at that time the movie was shot and must have had little experience with sex. Thus her performance was nothing short of fantastic! She deserved at least an Academy Nomination. I disagree with what Leonard Maltin wrote: ""Borderline tedious, yet offbeat and well mounted enough to amuse anyone inclined to see it in the first place. Peripheral characters are more interesting than the two leads (At Least When Clothed)."" This was a very serious film and very well crafted. It transported us back to the mores and social situations of the 1920s Vietnam with ease. And while the peripheral characters were quite interesting I do not feel in any way that the leads were lightweights. They more than carried their weight and had me aching for more. The racism and sexism was evident during the time period and it was showcased with aplomb. The love the two had for one another grew but was not absolute as with when we see how March ignores Leung's character in front of her family. Despite this he still allows her to come back to him (Could This Be Because He Allowed A White Girl To get Away With More?). She was a kind of trophy that he enjoyed having on his arm. yet it is clear that both were using one another.

I recommend this DVD highly. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I also recommend the book. At only 115 pages it's short and can be read in one or two reading sessions. Buy them both and you won't be disappointed. Maltin gave it Two and a Half stars out of Four. I give it Five Stars out of Five Stars. A great film!",1437609600,,2929,4.339416058394161

833596,5,6304286384,An extremely romanticized version of the book and of Marguerite Duras' life in French Indochina as a young woman. It's worthwhile to  read the book and Duras' later  account of the love affair which she said was more honest in 'The North China Lover.'  In the later book she claimed to have had sex with not only the Chinese man but also with her younger brother at that same period. She said she disliked this movie which she believed was overly Hollywoodized and fake.  She couldn't understand why the director chose an English actress to play the part of the French girl. Nevertheless the film has a haunting quality that depicts a way of life in that time and place. Some believe the two main characters represent the colonized and the colonizer with their shifting power. To see the girl as the oppressed seems to me naive. Apart from money the Chinese man has nothing. In that society he is viewed as an outcast by both whites and Indochinese and he is forced to marry according to family custom. The film score adds a lot to the success of the movie and the acting is excellent.,1427155200,,1085,4.520408163265306

833670,4,6304286384,"This screen adaptation of Marguerite Duras' novel of the same name is seductive, sensuous and smoldering. Though the film is NR (not rated), it's definitely an R. The sex scenes between the couple are quite explicit. The poor young French girl, only 15-1/2 at the time, is spotted on the ferry by the elegant Chinese man, aged 32 and he begins an immediate dialogue with her which leads to him giving her a ride to her school. She tells him she is in the 11th grade and is 17. At times, she looks more worldly and sophisticated than 15-1/2, but at other times she looks like a sweet young adolescent girl. She comes from a troubled home, where her widowed mother is hapless at keeping the family together, a cruel older brother is addicted to opium, and a sensitive younger brother quietly endures the hardships caused by their poverty.

The young girl is sent away to boarding school, where she soon begins an illicit affair with the rich Chinese man, who takes her virginity and awakens her sensual side. Though their connection is initially just physical, their relationship grows to a deeper emotional connection. However, they soon realize that the relationship is doomed due to their cultural and class differences. She denies to her family that she has been sleeping with the man, because her reputation would be ruined.

The settings, both indoors and outdoors, are lush and interesting and richly layered, providing a glimpse into Vietnamese life in the 1920's - when the French occupation was at its height. Both roles were perfectly cast, with beautiful young actors who smoldered in their onscreen chemistry.

 I watched the movie after having visited the home in Sa Dec where Huynh Thuy Le (the Chinese lover) lived. The home is instantly recognizable in a scene at about 1 hour, 20 minutes into the film. My only criticism is that the background noise sometimes overwhelms the dialogue, and I had to keep changing the volume in order to not miss some crucial conversation.",1416441600,,1986,4.83235294117647

The film is as engaging as the written word. Faithful, as could be when translating to film. But I would recommend reading the novel and then watching the film.

The story is that a young French girl living in French occupied Vietnam in the 1930's has an affair with a rich, young, Chinese man.  As you can imagine besides being controversial because it was an inter-racial affair the young man pays the girl, who generally gives the money to her mother.  The love scenes are very good.

Once you get past Jane March naked (and she is very naked in this film) and you look at her eyes and mouth you see what a great director can do with absolutely NO DIALOG.  Tony Leung and her speak without talking throughout this movie.  They speak with eyes and hands and fingers and lips.  Annaud takes the flash back to its limits with the opening.  He speaks with eyes, hands, fingers and even water going into the river.  His is one big controlled visual and audio feat where even hair is used to convey emotion.  In this film Annaud put's Bergman, Fellini, Speilberg and Hitchcock to shame with his total presentation that is diverted from the casual observer with nudity and sex scenes that, while a part of Annaud's project are only window dressing to an overall film that is a cinematic achievement.  This director doesn't miss a trick and, in fact, invents a few.  He gets Jane March to give a performance worthy of an Oscar she'd even get nominated for.  And in the end all you remember is that she's totally naked, but you never notice the acting performance she gives under or the cinematic event Annaud, Robert Fraisse and Noelle Boisson gives in one of the best acheivements in film I've seen in ages.",1393459200,3,1277,4.58590308370044

But for me the main picture was that of colonian life in Vietnam in the French colonial time. Here we see as Asian man in control of a beautiful European lady. He is Chinese, not the colonized Vietnamese, but still an ""Asian"". Despite his wealth and sophistication he is still considered a second tier person by the white colonizers. But here he is in control. And she, too, frees herself from the constraint of her condition as a white lady at a boarding school, and takes her liberties with the man she loves.

834303,5,6304286384,"The Lover is a phenomenal movie. The film describes a couple of issues that a teenage girl should never go through, although many do. The main character is a 15 year old girl who is involved in a complicated relationship while dealing with issues at home as well. It goes into great depth about how confusing life can be for a young girl. Although it takes place in the 1920's, I believe that many present-day children could compare with the story in a way--however unfortunate that may be. The Lover is a phenomenal film depicting the complicated life of a certain 15 year old girl.

  The main character of this movie is involved in what many people would consider a very odd sexual relationship, to say the least. Some may even go so far as to call it repulsive. It displays how love knows no age or color, but at the same time shows that love is not always enough. The love between a teenage girl and a grown man is unacceptable in many cultures. In some cultures, a biracial relationship is just as appalling. The main characters in this film suffer through both of these issues. Throughout the majority of the movie, the girl was depicted to be very strong with much knowledge beyond her years. She believes that she is using this man for money to help her family, when in reality; she is in way over her head. She does not realize this until it is over. The older man is depicted to truly be in love with her. I believe this scenario happens quite often. However, a child may seem to understand the complexity of the world and to be very strong, but a grown man still has no right to steal her mental and/or physical innocence.

 The film also went on to portray problems some children have at home. The way a child's home life is can greatly affect how he or she sees him or herself. It also affects who this child grows up to be. So many children are forced to grow up much faster than they can learn how to be adults. The Lover was a perfect example of how much trouble this can cause. No child should ever be forced to do unto themselves as the main character in this movie felt as though she must do.",1304640000,3,2112,4.3232323232323235

All the emotions in the movie were so real because Duras lived them and was able to communicate those feelings so beautifully in her book the movie is based on. The nudity and love scenes were not over the top or anything. They, for the most part, were very romantic. The acting was also great. Tony Leung Ka Fai has been a famous actor in Hong Kong for several years. Jane Marsh did a great job as well. I think Jane March could relate to the role in more ways than one as she is bi-racial, being half-European and half-Asian. The cinematagrapy, acting, directing, and story line were all great.

834442,5,6304286384,"Jean Jacques Anaud is a very talented director. Since his debut in 1977 with ""Black and white in colors"" and his cult movie ""The war of fire"", we were aware about him. He was the responsible for bringing us the notable cinematographic adaptation of ""The name of the rose"". That's why one wonders oneself  about his unlimited magic. ""The lover"" is a film based on Marguerite Duras' novel, and portraits the memories of a teenager who meets a Chinese and wealthy dandy. Impacted and dazzled by his elegance and good manners, tired of her problematic familiar nucleus, impoverished by external affairs and wishful to experience new sensations, becomes his mistress.

Although the film is slow-paced, it has intense moments, perhaps due the fact the handle of the narrative time doesn't fit with the time in the cinema. Sometimes reiterative and rhetorical, we will witness the imminent fatality that waits for them when the cultural, economic and social appears as an insurmountable barrier.

He is a rich ""Chinese man"" who tells her in the beginning that he doesn't want to do this, because he could fall in love with her. Forbidden love is always the best love. Yet, this love is ever lasting. The scenery is beautiful. Awesome photography, beautiful flowing music. At first, I wasn't too sure of this movie, but as I got lost in the story, I was so sorry it ended the way it did. It had no other way of ending! Chinese men with white women, was only for men with whores. White women, with Chinese men, was only for the money. How CAN a movie such as this, end any other way? Even in France, racial mixes such as this weren't allowed. There was no were for this couple to go. She (the girl) couldn't tell even her family the truth, and while he (the Chinese man) tried to tell his Father, he HAD to marry of Chinese decent. What a sad love story.

There were some slow parts, for me, but I understand the desire to tell the whole story.  I thought the mix of narration and actually being present in that moment very interesting.  They also did a nice job with the sex scenes, though on some I wish they had moved the camera closer to the action or at least gave more hints of it.

834610,4,6304286384,"Please note: I will be giving some of the plot away.

For anyone who views this film and thinks ""underage sex"" and/or ""porn"", there are some subtleties that need to be explored.

There is no reason to believe that the Chinaman sought out underage girls.  If anything, his station in Chinese royalty probably provided him with female companionship until (and perhaps after) his arranged marriage.

Through no effort on his part the schoolgirl appeared in his orbit and he found himself unable to look away.  This is a rare thing to experience and it is awfully hard to resist.

If we generally only see Leung and March having sex, we need to factor in that her jailbait status and the inter-racial nature of their relationship would not have allowed them to carry on a normal courtship.  The sex was just about all that was left to them (and the director).

It was tragic not to see these two end up together, but there was a redeeming event at the end of this movie that made it worth my while.

In his old age Leung wrote to March that he would ""love her until death"".  Society dictates that when two people part ways they must let each other go and move on.  Rarely do we give or receive the assurance of on-going love in a situation like this.  If both are in agreement that the relationship should not continue, this is a rare, beautiful, and appropriate gem to store away in one's heart.",1225756800,2,1392,4.48015873015873

834614,5,6304286384,"I love this Movie, I love the story plot, and most of all, I love Jane March and Tony Leung for doing this. Excellent job! Now, it's obvious to me that anytime the title,""THE LOVER"" is heard, I glow from the inside. That happened to me the first time I seen it on ON DEMAND. It was a windy night too. A fit night for a Sensuous, Breathtaking, Pulse pounding,and deeply intimate movie. I knew right then and there that I had to write about it. The remake of ""Lolita"" is my favorite, now ""The Lover"" is my 2nd best favorite movie around. This movie was everything I predicted. Once-young Actress Jane March had her character down to a key, being a girl who has a mother for a school teacher, a older brother for a jerk, a little brother who's shy and kind to everyone and has wandering eyes for the fortunate life. She meets Tony Leung's character ""The Chinaman"" and that's when love starts to bloom. When he touched her hand, while they were riding, she never felt nervous, she dosed off in the black car. I had the feeling that she didn't mind the Chinaman being attracted to her. And I guess he didn't mind her being sleepy at all. She kept this all on the Down-Low,She never told anybody, not even her friend at the camp. When the attraction came to the bedroom, nothing around them ever mattered. He was afraid and shy, but she trusted him. He worried that he'd be throwned in jail for Stachitory Rape, but she assured him that it'll be okay. She made her move, he made his, and everything else came with it. What really made me glow is that they didn't stop seeing each other, when he got married to some other woman,that's when the STEAMY affair ended. I had no issue with this movie because it was harmless. She loved him, he loved her and that was all that mattered to them. Age was indeed out of the question. So, this is why I give it 2 thumbs up, an A+,5 stars and everyting else that's in the book.

834619,5,6304286384,"Jean-Jacques Annaud (Two Brothers, Enemy at the Gate) made L'Amant (The Lover) in 1992. He wrote the script, but the story is from an autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras. Anyone who has heard the narrator from Hiroshima Mon Amour, the film Duras scripted for Alain Resnais, will know what to expect from the book, and from the film as well, for Annaud is faithful to it. Duras writes some of the most beautiful, most precise prose of any modern writer, and preserves a tone of ironic detachment that draws the reader deep into the emotional process she is describing.

Annaud takes a risk in following the book so closely, for his film becomes literary rather than cinematic, and viewers sometimes find it empty, lacking in the kind of melodramatic intensity we've become used to in movies. In a reference to Hiroshima Mon Amour perhaps, Annaud has two parallel narrative streams throughout the movie, and this device succeeds in making it a great movie.

Viewers, especially in puritan America, are taken aback at the intensely erotic lovemaking scenes, which comprise most of the visual content of the movie. The lovmaking is so real that one wonders if the actors were really doing it, and not acting at all (I think they were). Other components may be dwarfed by this content, but they are there: the magnificent photography of landscape and city which expresses the love the characters have for their home; the racial divide between Asian and European; and the overriding theme of growing up.

The second narrative stream is the reflections of the elderly Duras (spoken by Jeanne Moreau in a non acting but important role) as she comments on the actions of her younger self as they are depicted in the film. This is the essence of both book and film. The tender, nostalgic tone of the elder Duras discovers both innocence and ignorance in the younger one; this is an experience everyone (except the very young) can relate to. The grandiose, empty generalisations (all women are prostitutes, the young girl tells her friend: I wouldn't mind being one). The eagerness for sexual experience, for losing one's virginity and becoming 'adult'. Focusing on one's own overwhelming reactions and cultivating a kind of blindness to the reactions of others. It is by looking back that Duras discovers the depth of the passion she has inspired in her lover. It is by looking back that she also discovers her feelings, on the surface so self confidently detached, were deeper than she realised. The lover loved her all his life. L'Amant is a love letter both to him, the lover, and her younger self, an attempt to bring the love more perfectly to life in fiction than it was in real life, an appeal to all of us to understand more fully what we are feeling, even though Duras realises the ironic truth that to learn from our mistakes we first have to make them.

Postscript
I recently read a review of this film in which the reviewer said the film was weakened by the fact that Jane March couldn't act. The comment made me reflect on how often actresses who do nude scenes are said to be bad actresses. It's always sounded like puritanism to me: instead of saying it's bad to be naked you say the acting's bad. I thought the acting was good throughout this film. You cannot fault Tony Leung, one of the greats of the HK movie industry. Jane March was asked to play a young, inexperienced girl and her own acting inexperience helped her do a good job. She played a stranger in a strange land who was also a stranger in her own family slowly coming to self realisation through her own sensuality. March was believable through all this, and not only because she looked the part. But to get the most from the movie you can't just focus on Jane March, just as you can't just focus on Jeanne Moreau as she speaks Duras' words. You have to focus on both actresses at the same time. And if you do and you're a male you'll learn a lot about women.",1191196800,19,3937,4.652298850574713

834763,5,6304286384,"It has taken me two days to write this review. I was so awestruck by this film THE LOVER that I really pondered it before writing. Simply put, THE LOVER is an absolutely stunning and shockingly evocative piece of cinematic art. I knew NOTHING about this film before watching it, so I was totally taken by surprise by the depths of sexuality and passion that this film plummets. It is hard to express it otherwise. The film is dumbfounding in it's subject matter,acting,story,cinematography and soundtrack. This is what I like to call an ""all-around film"".....every note rings true!

Told from a detached point of view, THE LOVER concerns the 18-year-old ""the girl""(Jane March) in 1929 Indochina (French Colonial Vietnam),and her relationship with the 32-year-old ""the Chinaman""(Tony Leung).She is awakening sexually and he is obsessed with her. The very intense relationship progresses as each plays with each other's bodies, lives and feelings. He says that he is in a prearranged marriage and cannot marry her. But he seems totally taken with her. She says that sex is totally fine with her, but could she be denying that it is love that she feels? With both families aware and opposed to their meeting,""the girl"" and ""the Chinaman"" continue on exploring each other. It is only at the end that the true feelings are revealed. This may sound to some rather dull and boring, but trust me it is not! This is as sensitive as it is steamy,and will leave you breathless. This film has explicit sex scenes (very explicit),but they are so artfully done that one is not shocked,but rather is drawn into the experience that these two souls are having. I have never seen anything like it. If you are the slightest bit of a prude...well....you lose! This is a riveting  and rare piece of film. You will not easily forget this one.

834769,4,6304286384,"An alliance of convenience between a rich man and a needy young girl is explored through all its phases and taken to its final conclusion, decades later.  If you have an interest in this subject you will like the movie and see it as deep and profound, otherwise it will seem shallow and bore you because of the incompletely developed side plots.

There are many side plots.  Sexual awakening of a young girl, mentioned in other reviews, seems to be a side plot, though fairly well developed.  Chemistry between adolescent girls, the jealousy and competition among siblings, these are introduced but left frustratingly undeveloped.  It would have made the movie too long.

It works out much better than Lolita where the girl dies and the man is jailed for murder, but not as well as Psyche where through the diligence of her magical helpers and the deviousness of Venus there is a complete conversion from secret mistress to immortal wife, the oldest and most famous in literature.  The difference I believe is in the respect the older lover shows for the girl and her family, even though they don't deserve it.  This redeems his character as compared to Lolita's blundering lover who covers up his mistakes and takes no responsibility for outcomes.  But though responsible in the present this lover takes no responsibility for the future, unlike Cupid who insists on charging against fate and tradition (though sensibly so, and only after he has tested his companion).

The young girl also takes responsibility, entering the relationship with deliberate awareness.  The whole film/novel is in fact an exercise/lesson in self awareness.  But she is incomplete compared to Psyche, who allows herself to feel deeply enough to be moved while movement still matters.

By comparison the story also shows the role of circumstance.  In Psyche's story, Cupid's mother (wittingly or unwittingly, a subject for debate) plays an important role in putting the couple together.  In The Lover, his mother has died but her strong memory as evidenced by the sad state of his father sets the stage for love.  In Lolita, the man's mother is absent altogether and so is his respect for his partner or her family or any sense of personal responsibility.

What follows is somewhat of a spoiler.  I believe the movie shows the seven stages of an affair: infatuation, lust, love, rape, impotence, longing and reunion.  By omission it shows what an affair is not.  It is not the long term building of a family.  Had the girl become pregnant as Psyche did what would have happened?  It seems likely that in real life this would have happened, and then real choices would have to be made.",1171584000,8,2661,4.879732739420936

There is a deeper wisdom than projected on the surface of this movie.

The regional and cultural scenery also adds an intense mystique to the movie, as well as educated those less experienced about this culture and historical era.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie as it will surely surprise you in its originality and deep connections to a latent part of self, not always discovered in youth, but as can also be discovered at ANY stage of life, as is so often overlooked, yet well portrayed by the male leading character, played by the HOT actor Tony Leung Ka Fai.

She is approached by an elegant dark man from Cholon who is also crossing the Mekong that day towards Saigon... 'I like your hat. It's original. A man's hat on a young girl,' he expresses, and continues: 'If you want I can drive you to Saigon.'

The rich Chinese playboy with a black Rolls-Royce is 32 years old, from that financial minority that owns all the popular housing of the colony... He's back from Paris where he undertook some business studies...

The film, beautifully shot, is a dreamy fantasy of escape through sex... The escape is that of the poor French teenager from the horror of her house in Sa-Dec... While the girl merely abides her innocent mother, she loves her younger brother poetically, without reserve... Her brother is handsome but not bright, romantic but terribly fragile... She fears her elder brother, a brutal and lawless dissolute man, stupidly dependent on his mother... The inexperienced girl wants to see him in pain...

The most remarkable aspect of the story is the strength of character of the young girl who is always a little sad... She finds the strength to proceed against the forbidden with a calm determination... ""I've never followed anyone into a room yet.,"" she exclaims...

The room was dark, shipwrecked, surrounded by the never-ending clamor of the town, carried away by the flow of the town... Her body was in that public noise... Their love was erotic, immediate, unrestrained... It was physical, violent, devastating...

But the girl loves other young woman in the boarding house, the 17-year-old Helen... Her passion for Helene is intense... Helen is immodest... She don't realize she walks naked in the dormitory... She doesn't know that she's very beautiful... She's innocent lingering on in youth...

'The Lover' parallels the life of Duras herself... The setting, in Indochina, is one she knows intimately... The story is set mostly in the early 1920s following the decline of French domination of the territory that is now Vietnam... The film is the most exciting journey along a winding river of passion, which ultimately flows to the sea...

Jean-Jacques Annaud handles the story with real sensuality, romance and dramatic power... He shots much of the film with a distinguished style...

Jane March is attractive, but not obviously beautiful... Her impressionable teenager's gradual understanding of sexuality is well presented... She was subjected to a close, penetrating gaze by Annaud's camera..

Tony Leung, as the rich Chinaman, is the lusty son unable to escape his family's commands...

Although unseen, Jeanne Moreau jaded voice narrates the action and imparts a special flavor... Her words are poetry, as any Duras reader knows...",1166227200,5,3269,5.112570356472795
834926,4,6304286384,"I saw this movie years ago and decided to grab the DVD. The director, Jean-Jaques Annaud, is fantastic and the casting is top notch.

It has that lolita kinda feel because of the age difference between the two lovers, with a bit more sympathy for the characters. Both leads are very attractive and it sells their lust at first site kind of scenario.

It is French Colonial Vietnam in 1929. Their relationship feels doomed. Cultural restraints and plain bullheadness strive to keep them apart. The girl's family is provincial and disfunctional at their best. The chinese man has only his, traditional,chinese,upperclass, opium addict, father who is very distant but not so didtant as to le thim date a poor french girl.

Since they can't be together openly, they end up having a semi-secret affair. At this point their sex becomes the main character for awhile. There is alot of pathos in the sex. The sex is the story in alot of ways but its not smutty or dirty, just intense. the relationship devolves from there.

I won't give away anymore but yeah i think its worth buying. The director is very respectful to the actors and the entire movie is well shot and well acted.

The music of the movie flows through out. If you have seen some old movie, ie, the legendary ""Terminator"", you would hear those awful music as if they were from some bad porno movies. In ""The Lover"", the music, the scenery, the settings are so beautifully done, even viewed so many years later, it feels only better. And that is what should be called ""classic"".

835068,5,6304286384,"I'm in a state of awe after seeing ""The Lover,"" or ""L'Amant,"" the film based on the autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras. Duras wrote this confessional piece about a love affair she had while still a teenager with a much older Chinese man. It is set in 1920's Vietnam, a period of time where Vietnam was awash with the mingling of its colonizers: the French and Chinese. Although the story conveys an illegal relationship by today's standards (she was a minor), I'll just respect Duras' story since it is her life, after all, and refrain from condemning it as a film that condones statutory rape. So, with that out of the way, I'll proceed.

First off, the premise of the story is unique. Neither she or he are natives of Vietnam; however, this is where their relationship thrives. It is outside of Vietnam, or out of its social context, such as in her private family quarrels and his remembered experience with whites in France, that their relationship withers. Duras touches upon so many different divides: race, social hierarchy, economic disparity, age gap....It makes for an interesting story with many immobile elements. The movie is hauntingly beautiful and the actors are splendid. Jane March's final scene--during which she weeps for her lost love set to the background of a Chopin waltz--made my whole body ache with sadness. Tony Leung does a fine job of portraying the millionaire Chinese man who lives off of his family's extraordinary wealth and has no other passion than that of seeking and making love. His ample idle time, since he had never worked a day in his life, affords him the opportunity to woo this young French school girl. The movie is extremely sexually graphic, to the point that I had to fast-forward through those scenes, but I am told that Duras' novel itself was also quite graphic. Anyways, the two of them end up ""falling in love"" and find themselves bitterly destroyed by their impractical relationship. He has an arranged marriage to a stranger; her (albeit white-trash) family would never tolerate her being with a ""Chinaman.""

I love this movie for its honest illustration of impossible love. Annaud, the director, holds this film steady in its subtlety throughout, giving the viewer the option of deciding for oneself what their love really means. The characters are consumed by a romantic ideal that they are projecting on one another--which just fuels their relationship--and find wholeness, ironically, in an empty fantasy. She believes that he is too good for her, as the daughter of a family with a destroyed reputation; and he feels undeserving of her, since while he studied in Paris, the only white women he shared a bed with were French prostitutes. I think that, due to such insecurities and their volatile physical attraction, it seems only logical that they would fall for each other, or the ""idea"" of the other. When they are together, they fill one another's voids, and come to associate their wonderful world as distinct and far more perfect than the harsh reality outside of his ""bachelor's room."" She deals with an abusive brother, witless mother, and extreme poverty, while he finds himself of no other use than to love, and realizes that he will never gain access to the Western world of which he is so fond. Together, however, they venture into an existence of peace, validation, security--suspending reality even for a couple of hours at a time. They create a womb for each other in that dim-lit room of his, while the rest of the world bustles around in the Chinese district right outside the door. Rickshaws squeak on by, street vendors hawk their wares, people struggle to make a living, while the two lovers hold onto their fantasy for just a moment longer.

I don't really know how it would have turned out had Duras actually married this man. In a way, I'm glad that she didn't. They are creatures of different habitats and I doubt that their passion for one another would have carried them through decades of marriage and reality: think babies, diapers, child-sitting, who makes dinner, laundry, cleaning the toilet? [Come on, you've got to think about these things. I've come to ask myself anytime I meet a guy I'm remotely interested in: ""Can I imagine grocery shopping with him? How about going to the dollar store?"" ""Will he share household duties, such as cleaning mildew off of shower walls?"" ""What if I get really sick and throw up all over the place?"" Anyways, I digress. Back to the movie.] Even more, the beautiful Romeo and Juliet quality would be entirely lost if they had learned more about one another and come to realize that they were never in love with the person. Perhaps I am cynical, but I doubt that relationships based on initial attraction are sustainable. They are too far removed from reality and will forever be relegated to that of near-fiction, as in the case of the very real Marguerite Duras and her Chinese lover. In the end, I believe ""The Lover"" is a compelling study of how people fulfill their need for emotional survival. It is also a testament to how blind we are to our own deficiencies. Watch it.

well, they hook up. they get naked. very naked. they do the diddely. bodies so beautiful it's ART. (he has a gorgeous bum, wow) as a mommy, I just could not stop thinking ""this girl is going to end up pregnant!"" safe sex - kids!!!

why do we get to see full frontal nudity on a woman, but, on a man, just the rear? (can I say ass on here?)

The Southern province of Vietnam, which was then part of Indochina under French rule, is where she grew up until she became an adolescent. Her poor and difficult childhood shaped Marguerite's mind and rebellious spirit all of her life.

When she was still an adolescent in Vietnam, Marguerite indeed dated briefly a Chinese man, although it is very unclear whether she really had any serious romantic relationship with him or not at the time? It was perhaps nothing more than an invention, a simple friendlip or a flirt, who knows? The veracity of these events is irrelevant after all...

The movie was filmed beautifully. The director took a long time finding a young actress who would look very much like Marguerite when she was 15.

835222,5,6304286384,"Before being a cinematographic success The Lover (fr. l'Amant) is a masterpiece of literature, an autobiographical novel written by Marguerite Duras in 1984, in which the author reveals her torrid adolescent relationship with an older and affluent Chinese man in the Saigon of the 1930s.  Very few adaptations of novels to the screen have ever been rendered so faithfully.  Annaud is known for the meticulousness with which he approaches the details of his films, including the historical ones, and The Lover is no exception

The story is an interior monologue so laconically written that the film's characters aren't even named.  Jane Marsh, la jeune fille (""the girl""), acting is effortless and natural, portraying perfectly the ferocious individuality of the adolescent girl. Her resemblance to young Duras is uncanny.  Tony Leung Ka Fai, the ""Chinaman,"" is convincing in the role of the vulnerable aristocratic.

The soundtrack, by Gabriel Yared, follows the action well, complementing the scenes, without overwhelming them.  The theme, ""l'Amant,"" is equally poetic and lyrical as the text.  The dialogue is the manifestation of Duras's writing, and the voice-over sequences are taken verbatim from the novel.  The genius of Annaud is again apparent in his choice of Jeanne Moreau for the narrator's part.  Moreau's world-weary, destroyed voice could not have been better for conveying the tone of Duras's lyrical writing.

I was rather disappointed while reading more than a dozen American reviews of this film penned by professional film critics. Only one reviewer seemed to be knowledgeable about the author and the position she occupies in world literature.  Even one of the most respected film critics, Roger Ebert, seems to have missed the point of the film altogether, and dismissed it lightly. The majority of the film critics concentrated somewhat obsessively on the sexual scenes (which I must admit are rather explicit), to the exclusion of the other themes, and pronounced it soft-core pornography.  Since the running time of the film is 111 minutes, and only eight percent of it (a total of nine minutes) shows the two protagonists in explicitly sexual situations, including four and one half of actual lovemaking, I personally think the film hardly qualifies as soft-porn.  In my opinion, these movie reviews are the result of the genetic, generic puritan attitude that prevails in the American society.  Or maybe the reviewers were asleep during most of the film and only woke up for the ""good parts?""  So, let's put to bed (no pun intended) the question that this film is somehow pornographic

The Lover is a powerful emotional text, probing deep into the past of the narrator and into France's own colonial past.  It explores the intimate relationship between a young, poor white schoolgirl and her rich Chinese lover in the setting of the colonial society of the late 1920s Saigon.  It uncovers transgression, desire, separation, and death, the ecstatic and dangerous appeal of the mysterious ""other.""

The other, arguably as important, theme of the film is relationships -- with her school friend, Helene Lagonelle, the ambivalent tie between the girl and her mother, and the girl's disturbing relationships with her two brothers

Finally, there is an undercurrent theme which runs throughout the film, which is that of boundaries and borders. The film opens with a ferry ride across the Mekong and ends with an ocean crossing, signaling the constant crossing of frontiers and borders: geographic of course, but also racial, cultural, and sexual.  These are confronted and sometimes dissolved as the poor white girl of French parentage meets her wealthy Chinese lover in the Cholon, the ill-repute Chinese district of Saigon. She, a white girl, was raised among natives, almost as a native.  He is a native who experienced the western culture and somehow longs for it.

There is also the transitory period of the girl's adolescence, between what remains of her childhood, and the onset of her womanhood. On the ferry and on the steam liner, the girl wears a child's pigtails, but she is dressed in women's clothes.  The gender roles are somewhat blurred, too: she wears a woman's dress, but also a man's hat, in a color that signifies femininity.  The boarding school in Saigon is home mainly to the abandoned mixed-blood daughters of local women and French fathers. The girl has an intimate friendship with Helene Lagonelle, which is ambivalent and perhaps sexually charged. The girl is unable to treat the Chinaman with even a modicum of courtesy when she is with her brothers because he is Chinese, not white. In the public bus, she rides in front, separated from the locals, yet in her private home, she lived as a native. In the cocoon of the garconniere, she is separated from the crowd on the street by only thin cotton blinds. There is even a meta-boundary crossed, as Duras takes her memories and feelings and externalizes them in the form of her writing.  What has been internal and private becomes external and public.

The Lover is an autobiographical love story set in a post-colonial environment.  We owe the remarkable transcription of this literary masterpiece to the artistry and creativity of Jean-Jacques Annaud. In this production, he has successfully combined two art forms, the beauty of the written word with the fascination of the image. I believe that the film has been, for the most part, misunderstood in this country, and I would recommend a second, more open-minded look at it.

The carefully-schooled Caucasian female protagonist flouts contemporary [early 20th century] prejudices by embarking on an affair with a young, wealthy and handsome Chinese man for the purposes of helping her impoverished family out financially, not because she really has any deep feeling for him.

The sex scenes in the unrated DVD version of the film are simply breathtaking.  Contrary to another viewer, below, I find that art and expression of the film is accomplished through the love scenes.  After all, the story examines mystery, desire, and forbidden love.  The lovers are different, they are more, they are exuberantly liberated when they are together.  The love scenes provide the necessary counterpoint to the banality of their lives apart.  Their vigorous sexuality underscores the paradox of the rich, and worldly Chinese man who offers himself up to humiliation and abuse from French colonial white-trash, all for the sake of a young girl.  Their relationship is viseral and mysterious.  Their lovemaking and common language mask yet personify their embodiment of the mutual identities as part of the French and Chinese as colonizers of Vietnam.  L'Amant breaks new boundaries as an exploration of forbidden love, anticolonialism, and the suffering people endure because they resign themselves to living their own lies.  L'Amant is a beautiful film, brilliantly acted, that says so much by saying so little.  The film score by Gabriel Yared is also breathtaking.  Cinema doesn't get any better than this.  Hollywood is simply incapable of making a movie like this.",1105747200,92,1719,5.170289855072464
835365,5,6304286384,"The first time I heared about ""The Lover"", I was in highschool and it was one of those films that my fellow pupils scandalously giggled about in the corner.  In fact, one day when my parents weren't home, my best friend and I mischieviously decided to rent this ""borderline porn flick"" and get an eyeful of what all the hoopla was about.

While I expected various (and potentially continuous) horizontal aerobics, it was to my surprise that I actually liked this film and it had absolutely nothing to do with sex.

With my 16-year-old mind, I couldn't understand why I liked such a ""dirty movie.""

Was I a pervert?  Perhaps.

But most likely, I think I was just a curious teenager.

About thirteen years later, I watched this movie again and this time I loved it.

835369,5,6304286384,"For those who think this movie is only carnal, I extend my deepest sympathies for your apparent ignorance.  This is a romeo and juliet parallel not to be missed.
This is one of, if not the best, love story ever written.  It tells of a young woman, barely 17, whose life is already a tragedy. Her family was thrown from wealth and good standing, to poverty and squalor, scraping by to make ends meet in French occupied Vietnam.  She is all but shakespearean in her suffering, without the guidance of a father, and the love of a weak and unscrupulous mother and drug addicted brother.  There is much tenderness in the cannonization of the youngest brother, as a living saint, the one pure thing in her life.
The lover, played by Tony Leung Kai Fai, is himself, a tragic hero.  Educated in France, he longs to shirk the burden of his chinese culture, buck tradition and marry for love.  He is consumed by the forced arranged marriage, and pursues the young Jane March with the guile of an experienced and wealthy man, but with the tenderness and respect of a true lover.
The two make an arrangement to meet in his bachelor pad, which according to chinese tradition, is a ""practice area"" for marriage.  Jane March's young virgin surrenders to passion and experience, while remaining emotionally detatched from her chinese lover, for he tells her that they can ""never be married"" as it is ""not allowed"", and he would be disowned and poverty stricken if he went against the wishes of his family.  Seemingly, Jane March's character cares little for the potential of this toxic relationship, revelling only in the sexual experience and conversation that they share in their secret room, away from the rest of the world.  He is her escape, as surreal as the life she escapes from.
The scenes are intimate and touching, full of tenderness and imagery that conveys the worship like reverence with which they experience each other.  He, worshiping her sexual innocence, while she worships his sexual experience.  A powerful and erotic culmination.
Truly as story continues, you believe each of the characters less and less, as they joke about how they would not fit in to each others world.  They do a wonderful job trying to convince each other that the affair means nothing.  It becomes less believable, as you see them fall deeper and deeper into love, and examples of arguments where they truly hurt each other, in the way that only two people in love can wound.
A truly touching ending that had me in tears, as her ship pulls away from the harbour and he is there, in his car, watching her leave.
Highly recommend this movie as a measure to restore your faith in the very real power and strength of love, even when there is no ""story book"" ending.(...)",1090195200,38,2745,4.6819126819126815

The mother is a widowed schoolteacher and her brothers are obnoxious and want to get into her personal life.  She does introduce her lover to her family and he does treat them to dinner.  However, what was puzzling was their relationship.  Did they actually have real feelings toward one another?  He was arranged to be married and there would have never been anything more between them.
This movie diffrentiates between sex and love.  Is it possible to have a sex only relationship?  If so, how can it last?  Do emotional feelings get in the way of their relationship?

835463,5,6304286384,"Most people miss the boat in viewing ""The Lover.""  It is a semi-autobiographical novel based purely on memory of a young girl's first sexual awakening - so do not expect an effective visual translation of written words without some visual graphic description - especially when the primary focus of the novel is nuanced on physical love, in the setting of colonial oppression (France - Vietnam), social stratification (wealthy ethnic-Chinese enclave in Vietnam - poor French nationals living in colonial outposts), racial separation (native Asians - colonial Whites), then later, the realization of right-and-wrong (the mother apologizing to Tony Leung about her children's bad behaviour), and finally higher emotional love (Jane March's heart-broken scene on the ocean liner).
In addition, this movie was told from an impoverished, uneducated, inexperienced, nave, but yet elitist colonial French girl's point-of-view, in the 1920's Vietnam.  (Also remember that the younger Marguerite Duras was actually more Vietnamese than French.).  So...to call this movie a kiddie-porn / soft-porn in disguise is unfair - it IS about sex between a fifteen-year-old girl and a thirty-two-year-old man, no pretense here.  To criticize a certain scene as ""disguised rape"" is unfair - it WAS rape, a perfect cinematic description sexual aggression, control, and power. Things must be kept in context of the time and place. If one were to criticize every aspect of this film, then let's not make a film about colonialism, inequality of race or wealth, or any other wrong doing in the world.
And finally, how the French look at love and sex is different from many other cultures.  This movie is based on a French novel (one of many versions on the same theme by Marguerite Duras), as such, there is an expectation that the audience should know the plot already, and the movie should be treated as a visual extension - or one could say, a ""validation""- of their imagery when reading the novel (How would anyone know what Colonial Vietnam looked like without moving visual images on screen?).
I agree that the sex scenes border on soft-porn (one cannot make a successful intellectual movie nowadays without it being filmed in English, as well as some artful sex-scene thrown in); however, it was cleverly done.  And it is true that if these scenes were to be deleted from the movie, the rest would not make sense - because the novel was based on those bedroom scenes that subsequently shaped and formed Marguerite Duras's life.  I recommend, if you speak French, to watch the movie in the French soundtrack.  It provides a more authentic feel to the period (of course, the actors' mouths would not match the sound...but for Europeans, it is not of great detriments, as they are used to multi-culture casting.)",1069891200,21,2790,5.089715536105033

835465,5,6304286384,"In the film, 'The Lover', we witness a young woman ( she is post-pubescent) as she grows into the realization that her destiny is to write; that it is through her writing that she will make sense of the world and the events she has found confronting her within it.
Yes, there is a very direct and honest examination of the actual physical, sexual events transpiring in this life changing affair that this young woman is engaged in.  The sexual scenes are needed to ground the viewer into the intense transformation that is occurring to this young woman. A major aspect of this film is the examination of the loss of innocence and how one can choose to respond to that loss.

There is an incredibly poiniant scene nearing the end of the film where in, as she tries to dicuss the outcome of the affair with her lover as they walk on a coastal beach in the late afternoon, she realizes the path that her future must take; that she will write about things she has seen transpire within the emotional landscape of human interaction  and try as well to avenge wrongs done to people such as her mother by the French Land Office by writing of their existance and the physical and emotional havoc they have engendered.
This is a very subtle film. It is a film that when watched more than once, reveals unexpected new insights upon each viewing. I found the very last scene in the film to be one of the quietly saddest and yet hope filled scenes I have ever witnessed -  a testament to the fact that we, the human race, seem to hold love truely dear even if life does not seem to give us everything exactly as we have 'put in our order for it'. It is a film that examines what is involved in the creation of our hopes, dreams and desires - from the profane to the eternal - and how we variously deal with the elements fate confronts us with.
I think this is a subtle and questioning film - I reccomend it highly and I believe that if the viewer enters into the experience of this film with an 'open mind' that they will find many, many thought provoking rewards.",1063497600,9,2052,4.349869451697128

I first saw this film in 1994, curious because I had heard one of the scenes of Jane March and Tony Leung gave the appearance of them actually having sex while being filmed (and just see how controversy generates interest!).  Granted, the scene in question is ambiguous, but I found this to be of minor importance.  The film itself is beautifully photographed, but rather disturbing.
What disturbs me?  The scene where March appears to be raped--what, in fact, it is, could probably be best described as ""grudge sex.""  They have spent an evening with her mother and brothers, the mother having been drunk and asking for money from Leung's character, the older brother being openly hostile and challenging Leung to a fight.  Leung's character is thus angry--he slaps March's face, then throws her on the bed and takes her.  She, through this scene, looks bored and annoyed herself.  This scene, apart from the other sex scenes in the film, is distinctly unappealing.
Further, the character of the older brother, who comes off as tyrannical, pugnacious and determined to trample his family down.  These two scenes, taken together, make for an uncomfortable reminder of the families of some acquaintances I have known.
For those scenes, and the shallow premise of the film, I dock this film a star.  That said, it is beautifully filmed and deeply erotic--I particularly liked the relationship between the female protagonist (March) and her lovely schoolmate who ""walks naked through the dormitory (and) has no idea how beautiful she is.""

I personally agree with rattlesnakes that this part of the scene not only presents raping but also shows that women are treated as cheaps like been treated as a horker or so called prostitutes.

Tony Leung and Jane March superbly portray the tensions existing within the multiple layers of colonial relations - the emasculation of the Chinaman vis a vis the privilege of the girl's whiteness playing out along with the shame and barbarity of the girl's poverty vis a vis the civility and access of his Chinese (not even native) affluence. Ultimately, the schism wrought by the sociocultural constraints of their disparate backgrounds is what tears them asunder or rather dooms their romance from the beginning.

What Annaud does brilliantly is to portray the lovers' yearning without giving voice to it overtly. He depicts it through a series of disavowals, through the wounds they inflict on each other, and allows the viewer to fill in that which cannot be uttered.

As for the graphic portrayals of sex, I am usually the first to decry graphic sex scenes.

This is what film is all about its a story about a 32 year old man and a 15 year old girl who have a sexuel relationship together. Thats why its so taboo for is because of the age difference not to manchen the extremely graphic love scenes and rape scenes only found in the unrated version on DVD. This film is incridable and is only for adults do to the graphic subject matter even the R rated version is bad and thats not even close to as graphic as the unrated version is. The unrated version which has ten more min of graphic sex put in to the movie. The unrated version would difenitly be rated NC-17 if it want throught the ratings bord. This is a wonderful film but for adults only.
  Warning: This film is unrated do to graphic sexuality,graphic sex scenes,graphic rape scenes,graphic nudity,and graphic language. This film is for adults only.",1010880000,35,1042,4.783333333333333
835743,5,6304286384,"""The Lover"" is a gorgeously sensuous and erotic film about a young girl's awakening to love and her own sexuality.  Whover categorized this movie as soft porn needs to wash his or her mind out with Lysol.  It is, quite simply, a love story.

Jane March plays ""the young girl"", a French adolescent in colonial Vietnam living with her widowed mother and two brothers.  Her mother barely makes ends meet by teaching, her younger brother, with whom she has a relationship both protective and erotic, is weak and passive, and her older brother is brutally antisocial, stealing the family's few funds to support his opium habit and bullying his younger siblings through violence.

The girl attends a lyce in Saigon where she and her friend are the only Caucasian pupils.  On a trip from her home back to school she meets ""the Chinaman"" played by Tony Leung, and their encounter sets off sparks.  Leung is the son of a rich overseas Chinese, engaged to marry the Chinese girl picked out by his father, who spends his own days in an opium haze; his feelings for the young girl are at first purely sexual but ripen into a love so deep it confuses and frightens him.

It's a love that is doomed from the start.  His father will not hear of him marrying a non-Chinese, and her family, although the equivalent of white trash, still considers themselves better than the Asians they live among.  When the word of her affair with the Chinaman gets out, she becomes an outcast among her schoolmates.  The young girl tries to cope with the social and emotional conflicts by convincing herself and telling him that she doesn't love him; he knows she's kidding herself and so do we, and toward the movie's end, when she has lost him forever through his marriage to the woman chosen for him by his father and her own repatriation to France, she can't hide from herself the fact that she is deeply in love with him.

Jane March is incredible in the role of the young girl; she brings out all her character's innocence, sexuality and adolescent confusion.  Tony Leung is just right as the pampered son of a rich family who is hamstrung by the mores and traditions of his family and society; and Frederique Meininger is especially effective as the mother, who dotes on her worthless older son (the more venal she knows he is, the more she dotes on him, helpless to deal with the reality of what he is, and worse, what he will become), and condemns her daughter's relationship with a Chinese on the one hand while she has no problem taking her daughter's lover's money on the other.  The cinematography is beautiful and conveys all the heat and languor of colonial Vietnam.

This is no film for children; the sex scenes are as explicit as can be shown in any film not rated X.  At the film's end (Jeanne Moreau does an excellent voice-over throughout the movie), when the Chinaman after decades of silence telephones the girl who is now a middle-aged woman and tells her he has never forgotten her and will love her until death, we realize how strong was the love between these two.  It's a beautiful film of two people who were just right, even while they were all wrong, for each other.

835747,4,6304286384,"Beautifully filmed with attention to detail in order to capture 1920's Saigon, you'll find yourself watching this film over and over again. The Director's Cut contains some of the steamiest, most arousing scenes on film, yet they were still tastefully done and befitting of the story. One of the most erotically-charged scenes occurred when the young girl presses her lips against the window of the man's limo. She, of course, is kissing his reflection in the glass. That scene alone captures the extreme sexual yearning and desire between the two characters--in fact, you will feel what the characters feel when watching it. Only thin glass separates the two at that point. These lovers are doomed from the start, with their differences in age, in economic class, and in race. A poor, ""white trash"" French girl was still considered of a higher class than an extremely wealthy Asian man back in 1920s Saigon. The two lovers struggle with these differences within themselves and within their families. Sadly, the girl's mother sees a cash cow in her young daughter's lover and allows the illicit affair to continue. The story in poignant and touching at times, sensuous and erotic, but there's always underlying current of drug-induced violence, hatred, and tension which rears its ugly head, especially during the scenes where the young girl returns home during school breaks. A coming-of-age film that will leave an indelible impression.",990489600,12,1438,5.14957264957265

A young teenage girl (Jane March) begins a love affair with a much older wealthy Chinese man. The book is good but not really cinematic material. The film is highly sexual, mostly between March and this man having sex and a few scenes of her dysfunctional and economically challenged family. I have only ever seen Jane March in highly sexed roles, so I have no idea if she has any talent. This film shows her at barely 18 herself.

835840,5,6304286384,"The scenery in this movie is gorgeous.  The plot is very well-developed, orginal, and not to mention risky- a young girl with an older man in an interracial relationship in the 1920's.  This is a deep look at a young girl's coming of age and early sexuality.  It is her first look at adult life, and is a good escape from her ""white trash"" family, poor surroundings, and boarding school where she is one of only two white students.  The older man becomes not only her lover but her escape.  Her character can be dislikable because she is always brutally honest; however, she is true to herself and honestly does not know if she loves the man or if she is confusing love with power, acceptance, sexual awakening, access to money, or anything else.  The man insists the whole time that he loves her and seems sincere, although there is one part where he says that the only white women he could ever get were prostitutes, so he could have an ulterior motive of being with a willing white partner.  In any case, this movie is a unique and sincere portrait of two very different people, both alienated in the world they live in, both aching for love, sex, and something different in their respective lives.  This movie is very erotic and moving, but it also has a great, often very sad, plot.  It is fantastically directed and acted out.  Anyone looking for a fascinating perspective on the old unrequited love plot will enjoy it.",972259200,20,1425,4.552941176470588

Ultimately,  though, the characters are flippant and unbelievable. There has to be some  sort of depth to them, good or bad, but it's just not in the movie. It's a  damned shame, because it's close, and if the director/screenplay writer had  gotten it right this would be one of the finest movies made.

835842,4,6304286384,"I take it from the reviews on this site that people can't stand this film because they perceive that it has ""no depth"", or that its just a porno, or has too many ""highbrow"" aspirations, or that the voice  over is redundant.
I can understand how the film can be seen as so.  Everytime a film maker tries to do something different with film narrative  he gets a whack.  Yes, this film is sylistic.  Yet it is far less  stylistically innovative than the book by Duras, the blueprint which veins  this film.  The book is one of the most successful experiments in narrative  - it is the most amazing experience to read it, and I highly recommend it -  but not to anyone who is impervious to originality, and only wants the old  1-2-3, beginning-middle-end progression.  However, back to the film, I  think that the voice-over is to re-create the feeling of the book which  loops from present to past and shifts narrative perspective continually,  and also to draw attention to the lushness and sensuality of the subject  matter.  It creates an almost voyeuristic thrill.  Why else: look at me,  I'm fifteen ...  And yes, I can imagine that this would disturb people, to  be made more aware than usual of the vouyeurism of cinema, to be aware that  they are watching someting of great sensuality and emotional complexity.  I  felt that the camera had a sensitivity to detail which was almost painful  to watch, in that little things; the flutter of silk, the stain on the  lips, and even shadows, seem to be laden.
Yes, the story is perverse.  Duras herself admits to perversity - and she also had noted that sometimes  people will not understand that perversity, and will therefore never  understand her.  Or the film, for that matter, which is a perverse thing of  great beauty.",963964800,16,1774,4.644012944983818
835843,5,6304286384,Few American reviewers seemed to like this film.  Much of what was said about the film seemed  more to do with contempt for minimilistic moviemaking (so this is often confused as porn)  rather than any any  attempt to understand and appreciate the vast stories behind these  characters lives.  There is more story revealed in The Lover (and more  emotion) than any 100 other films released in mainstream America.  A film  like this is important because it provokes the watcher to learn more about  the the author of the book on which the movie was based.

The boarding school friend is set aside as March  goes forth with boldness and passion rarely seen. Is it a show for love,  passion, or money? The patient proactive lover wants his heart but follows  the culture. He plays the role fine but March lives it and so naturally  too. Explicit yet not a voyeur movie. Love interwines in a beautiful story  that can be true. But, is March in self-denial with her reason for the  love? Or is she just so cool and detached? March's performance is superb.  Is this an older person with a teen body and passionate spirit. The young  son is cowardly and the older a despicable bully. The mother seems  overwhelmed but goes along knowing the bully has taken her heart and $$.  March comes to the rescue of the family and maybe herself.

I am still unsure.  March is magnificient. Why is she  being hidden? Are movie makers repressed, too? A+ picture with sadness and  poignancy.

835846,2,6304286384,"Fairly well directed, visually sumptuous, The Lover could've been at the very least an aesthetic pleasure.  Sparks do fly between Tony Leung Kar-fai and Jane March (despite their inability for dramatic depth and subtext);  they look terrific onscreen.
Then the voice jumps in.
Jeanne Moreau's  old-woman voice-over completely sabotages the intimacy and hushed romantic  tones of the first encounter.  Over the film, Moreau's terrible voice-over  would intrude with alarming frequency, telling the viewer what s/he already  knows, and in an absolutely nauseous way.  Why tell us ""Then he was  gripped by fear"" when the actor can play it onscreen?  (As limited  Leung is, he can play that.)  Why make the cinematic literary?  Above all,  why have an old woman tell a young girl's story, thus giving the narrator a  hefty, arrogant ""I-know-better"" stance so that the story is  almost reduced to being an entry in the Better Sex video series?
The  Lover's highbrow aspirations will make you feel guilty for not liking it.  Resist the temptation, however -- high or low art, The Lover is mediocre  filmmaking, with insufficient complexity to match its visual flair and  un-self-conscious sensuality -- its two redeeming factors.",933552000,8,1223,5.238341968911917

out steps a tall rich looking china-men, he walks slowly over to the young women and wants to chat with her, but he
is very shy and kind of embassed, he knows she is beautiful and young and he is older, so,
