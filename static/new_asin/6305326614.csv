7887923,5,6305326614,A nice addition to my collection! I now have both this collection and the VHS collection. Plus I now have the best version of Godzilla vs. Mothra released in the U.S.!,1381449600,,167,4.419354838709677
7887924,4,6305326614,"Just so you know, Gojira was named after one of the electricans working on the set of the first movie. The film and the monster had yet to be named shortly after filming began. The electrician nicknamed ""Gojira""...(man-ape) became, almost a mascot for the film crew. Sometimes, It pays off to be one of the nice guys.",1309910400,,317,4.578947368421052
7887925,5,6305326614,"This pack features some of the greatest Godzilla movies of all time  (exluding ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" and ""Godzilla vs.  Megalon"" which they should have put in). ""Godzilla: King of the  Monster"" (1956) is the first and one of the best of all the series!  Stark black and white makes it the scariest of all the films!  ""Godzilla vs. Mothra"" (1964) is a great addition in here, seeing  how it's the first movie where Godzilla and Mothra meet! ""Godzilla vs.  Monster Zero"" (1965) is one of the best Ghidorah movies of the series.  This film features 3 monsters including Godzilla , Rodan, and of course the  title character... Ghidorah (called Monster Zero in this film).  ""Godzilla's Revenge"" (1969) is cool to me because Toho stole alot  of scenes from all the other Godzilla films and stuck them in here. So, I  can watch all the best fight scenes without having to change movies. This  one features Godzilla's son, Minya. Last, but defenetly not least...  ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" (1975), which is the sequal to the 1974  ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"" where Godzilla's mechanical double  rears his ugly head once more, and he's got a new side kick...  Titanosaurus! Get these films, you won't be dissapointed. The sound quality  is great, the movies are all in the SP mode, all the films are digitally  remastered, using the original negatives of the film, and all the film's  scenes are complete with no missing footage.  (which can't be said for alot  of other Godzilla films that are being released by other video  distributers... oh I don't know... mabey ""Goodtimes Homevideo"",  who will release almost any peice of edited, low quality, SLP, Godzilla  junk they can lay their hands on... sorry, I had to say that once).",959558400,9,1726,4.848797250859106
7887926,3,6305326614,"I have to agree with two of my fellow reviewers, but for completely opposite reasons!  The positive: for the money, a 5-DVD set of Godzilla movies is indeed a bargain, particularly when the only stinker in the bunch  is ""Godzilla's Revenge"" (a disc which should find its way  straight into the trash bin).  The four remaining movies are easily worth  the price of the package.
The negative: NO SUBTITLE OPTION!  In my  humble opinion (an opinion based on 20-odd years of appreciation for  Japanese pop culture), the omission of subtitles...or indeed, original  Japanese versions of the movies, which could have easily been fitted onto  the discs...is pretty near inexcusable.  Why even bother to put these  movies onto DVD when there are few or no special extras thrown into the  package?  Just throwing the movie onto a new medium just for the sake of  exploiting old material just doesn't sit well with this particular  reviewer.  If you're just starting to get into the world of Godzilla and  his rubbery friends, this is a good package to pick up.  Too bad that it  offers nothing really new for those already into Japanese monster movies.",957312000,,1143,4.854166666666667
7887927,4,6305326614,this is totally worth the money you are paying for it if you are a godzilla fan.  5 of the best godzilla movies ever made (although the king kong one is missing) in one collection.  both are available to watch in  either widescreen or normal.,947635200,3,242,4.333333333333333
7887928,2,6305326614,"First let me say that I love Godzilla and these films are some of the best . What I am annoyed with is the lack of a subtitles option . Why put these films on DVD and leave out this option ? OK I know that most people grew up  and loved the awful dubbing, but for those of us who rate these films as  important celluloid history, this omitance is unforgivable !
Give  Godzilla the same respect accorded to anime such as 'Ghost in the shell' .  And while your at it give us the origional Gojira film alongside the  Raymond Burr re-hash . Got that....Good .
P.s. If anyone knows where I  can get this stuff please e-mail me, monkeymagick@hotmail.com",946166400,5,647,4.262295081967213
7887929,4,6305326614,"if you love godzilla for what he is, this is the package for you. the titles included in this set are: godzilla: king of monsters, godzilla vs. mothra, godzilla vs. monster zero, godzilla's revenge, and terror of  mechagodzilla. all these and extra fancy monkeyjunk like screensavers,  trivia, and galleries for under 50 bucks? that's a (PUN ALERT!!) monster of  a deal! what's keeping this from being five stars? unfortunatly, there's a  little foible in terror of mechagodzilla. for some dumb reason, the  manufacturers (spellcheck) forgot the audio for the final battle. i checked  with amazon, and they say that it's the manufacture problem, and they're  doing everything they can to get get it fixed. so unless you HAVE to get  the awesome-possum audio, or you're too lazy to make up the sound effects,  this is a great set of dvds. and hopefully the audio will be fixed and i'll  give it five stars.",934761600,9,905,4.856209150326797
