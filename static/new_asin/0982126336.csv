She read  and looked through every one of them, then requested that we buy this one as it was the easiest to learn from and seemed very clear in the detail of signs as well.",1442016000,,306,4.0

7795061,5,0982126336,My 12 year old Granddaughter and I found this DVD a fun and encouraging starting point for learning Sign Language.  We were so encouraged by the teaching it was hard to stop each night after three vocabulary lists so we could review with each other before bed.  Within the week we were greeting each other in the day with phrases building on our vocabulary.  We could hardly wait for the next night to add more vocabulary.  Thank you for this educational DVD and about the program offering at the ranch.  We lift prayers for all that is being done at the Rice Ranch for those who want to learn.,1440115200,2,594,4.412844036697248
