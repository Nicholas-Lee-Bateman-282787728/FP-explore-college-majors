6901531,5,B00R71A3BG,Libera is World Class singers..  Voices of Angels,1426204800,,49,5.125
6901532,5,B00R71A3BG,"In August, 2014, Libera came to Washington, D.C. to perform and record a concert for PBS. Unfortunately, circumstances did not permit me to attend the concert; so I was anxious to see the recorded version. I finally got my hands on the Blu-Ray version of Angels Sing, Libera in America a couple days ago. Having already seen the PBS broadcast version of this concert, I was anxious to compare it to the Blu-Ray version.

The most notable difference between the Blu-Ray (as well as the CD and DVD versions) and the broadcast version is that it contains three more songs. These are added as extra features. It also has a little background feature that has already been on the internet for several weeks.

As Cassius OConnell-White says in the introduction, the concert is Libera like. The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception is a gorgeous venue for a Libera concert. The recording is full of beautiful singing, beautiful lighting, and the other special things that are typical of Libera concerts. One thing not so typical of Libera concerts is the preponderance of English lyrics. Past Libera concerts Ive attended contained Latin lyrics in about half the songs. In this new concert  I suspect in deference to the American television audience  only two of the numbers included in the broadcast segment contain Latin. (Sanctus is in Latin; and the three word introduction to Joyful, Joyful, we adore thee. is also Latin.) As has been their custom in recent tours, Libera included a selection particularly targeted at the host country. In this case, it was America the Beautiful. This, as well as How Great Thou Art and some others were new to the Libera repertoire. The boys did a superb job on all the new songs; and Robert Prizemans (Liberas director) arrangements were beautiful, as always.

I am reluctant to pick out specific boys for particular notice, but I must compliment Isaac London on his excellent solo work. For an eleven and a half year old, his singing was technically right on; and his expression was equally beautiful. Also, it was great to see Joshua Madine playing piano. Josh has been a very popular, singing member of Libera for years. (I remember him singing in the first concert I attended in 2008, and I even had a chance to speak with him post-concert in 2011.) Its so nice that hes been able to stay with the group even though hes now 20. In addition to the keyboard work, he was the Libera spokesperson during the PBS broadcasts for both this and last years Christmas concert promotions.

The bottom line is that this is another great Libera recording. The sound and staging are first rate. For that I must give the recording five stars.

Nevertheless, I must also make a couple negative comments. I was very happy when I found that this years recording would be available on Blu-Ray as well as standard DVD. I have a very nice playback set-up, and it demands the added quality of Blu-Ray for best performance. Of course, it also shows problems more readily. I saw a few problems in what I understood to be a Hi Def PBS broadcast, but I waited for the Blu-Ray before making final judgment. The quality of the Blu-Ray was better than the broadcast version (at least based on the broadcast in my geographic area and with my cable system) in terms of video noise and color rendition; however, there were obvious production problems. In several scenes, the picture was not in focus. This was very apparent on my 110 screen. I would blame my own equipment if it were not for the fact that some other scenes were so sharp that you could count the hairs on the boys heads. With all the money spent on this production and all the hard work that Libera put into it, this kind of technical discrepancy should not be present.

The second negative involves an error that crept into Amazons description of the Blu-Ray. For a couple of weeks, the description stated that the Blu-Ray was only playable in Region B/2 (Europe). In desperation, I contacted Libera directly. They assured me that this was an error, and ultimately Amazon corrected the error. But in the meantime, it did cause a lot of concern; and I felt compelled to even order the DVD in addition to the Blu-Ray to assure that I would have a playable version as soon as possible.",1426118400,8,4278,4.6946666666666665
6901533,5,B00R71A3BG,"I was not at either of the concerts in DC but I have seen Libera ""live"" twice in the past and they are the very best boys singing group to listen to on any occasion. What I can tell you about their performance in DC is that I was fortunate enough to see it on TV when PBS ran it for one night and believe me when I say, it was truly amazing. Their singing was beautiful and all of the soloists were right on.  I think it was one of the best performances I've seen either ""live"" or on video. I also recorded it and to be truthful, I can't tell you how many times I've watched it since the first night but I'm sure I surpassed 40 sometime last week after watching it back to back 3 times. If you enjoy a boys treble voice then I know you will enjoy either the DVD and/or CD. I enjoy listening to Libera sing while I'm driving and their voices keep me calm especially in traffic. Be like me and buy at least one of each and more for gifts especially at Christmas as their music makes a wonderful Christmas gift.  Go ahead and place your order, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",1425254400,16,1076,4.046948356807512

6901540,5,B00R71A3BG,Fantastic. Wonderfully arranged and sung Christian music. Easy to listen to and view over and over again. (Would have been nice if the lyrics were included with the DVD.) I commend Robert Prizeman for bring us this unique and pleasant sounding choir. I particularly enjoy his arrangements based on the music of notable composers from the baroque through the romatic periods. I have purchased a number of Libera CDs just to hear more. My hat is off to the choristers who successfully perform what is demanded of them. They are all so talented and professional.,1462233600,,559,4.894736842105263

Special mention to Sam Wiggin's interpretation of Wayfaring Stranger is very emotional as well as Thomas Delgado Little's Ave Maria and Voca Me. The powerful performance of all the songs is amazing. Kudos to Alessandro, Lucas, Isaac, Gabriel and Ciaran, sublime performances. The most amazing is the vocal control",1454544000,,485,5.394736842105263

The standard of this choir is uniquely outstanding, un-equalled by any other boy's choir. The production was filmed beautifully, and the audio is outstanding, despite one little incident with a microphone during one of the announcements. For me this is a 10 out of 10 rating Blu-ray.",1440806400,,376,4.984126984126984

6901580,5,B00R71A3BG,"Libera's absolutely amazing they always have been and this concert In Washington, D.C. was no exception. The selection of songs are well thought and placed and I can honestly say there's hardly a misstep in the entire concert.  That being said my one gripe was how the best song and solo Ave Maria was excluded from the main feature. The young soloist's voice was awe inspiring, astonishing really.

 Be sure to pick up the cd of this concert as well for a more complete experience, it includes all three songs missing from the main feature. ( as not to alarm anybody I should point out the missing songs from the main feature are included in extras of this blu-ray/dvd as well).

And lastly on a totally unrelated issue its never too early to start thinking about another Christmas album hint hint hint...",1427068800,4,806,4.654929577464789
6901581,5,B00R71A3BG,"This album finally addresses one of my main complaints with Libera--no/little American-focused content. They've added a few new songs, mainly ""America the Beautiful,"" to increase their American appeal and it works. I was at this performance and this bluray captures it well, especially given that it is encoded in DTS-HD (uncompressed audio). I strongly recommend this as an introduction to Libera because of the content, but if you want a great overall sample of Libera, their album Eternal: The Best of Libera is great.
One of the benefits of Libera is in its very nature: the group is always changing because the boys grow older and younger boys are added. We're at the beginning of this group, so they should keep this sound for some time.
Prizeman is, as always, excellent in his arrangements. The music is beautiful and the vocals are amazing given that this is a live performance.
Video quality is good, but a bit grainy at times. This is probably more a result of the cameras used than the bluray itself. The audio, as mentioned, is uncompressed DTS-HD so it is very good. Vocals are focused on the center and L/R channels, while music and audience response fills all channels.
Libera is prepping for a tour here in April and I would highly recommend you attend!",1427068800,3,1270,4.80365296803653

6901585,5,B00R71A3BG,"I would recommend this recording to all Libera followers, new and old.

This recording is particularly collectible because of the sheer amount of resources that was devoted to the concert. The vocalists number over 30, with several returning members who were thought to have left the group. In addition, there are more musicians, so the texture is more wholesome. All of the action is captured by nine cameras, which produce clear close-up shots as well as nice swooping views most of the time.

The vocal performance itself is close to perfect (I described it in detail on the CD page.) If I recall correctly, Libera dedicated a week (in America) to  rehearse for the concert. You can see from this recording how well-prepared everybody is. In fact, you will appreciate the soloists more, because they somehow manage to make no mistakes despite standing (often far removed from the group) in front of the large audience and vast environment.

The lighting deserves special mention. Rays of colors appropriate for each song either illuminate the boys' white robes or converge in mid-air. Fog from the stage add to the mysterious feel. The overall effect is simply stunning - you will have to see for yourself.

Some of the editing issues mentioned by previous viewers do exist, but Libera itself is not to be blamed. Three of the most Libera-esque songs are extracted and put into the Extras section. Some scenes are unfortunately out of focus. The credits have gross typos and interrupt ""Song of Life."" These mistakes, however, should be overlooked as Libera is a non-profit group and has little involvement in the technical production.

To summarize, this recording presents and preserves the best performance of Libera today.",1426636800,3,1728,5.024475524475524

They are so great. there was a missing song that you can get from ITune and that song is I Vow to Thee, My Country but I understand this DVD was made for the USA for PBS fund raiser. Libera came over to sing and make in the USA. And the song I Vow to Thee, My Country is a British patriotic song. You will love all the songs in this Blueray DVD!.I  wish they would had waited to start show the credits until after they was done singing the last song ""Songs of Life""!

The boys performed a mixture of secular and spiritual music and they did a masterful job with each selection. This is definitely one to add to your collection.

For those who are fans for a long time, you do get to see Josh Madine, one of the popular boys when he was still singing accompany the group in two of their selections.",1426291200,,572,4.653465346534653
