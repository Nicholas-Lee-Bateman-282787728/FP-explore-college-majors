8361402,1,B000E304YK,I adored Flash Gordon- (buster crabbe) and the movie plot and all of the film props used. What I did not like was the very poor viewing quality of this particular version because there were alot of white lines running through the film. One can tell that in this edition the film needed to be cleaned up.rk.swim@gmail.com,1312588800,,320,4.631578947368421
