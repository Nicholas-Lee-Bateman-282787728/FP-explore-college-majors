8685330,5,B00OYJDKHS,I saw this film at a film festival. It was really funny and the acting was good. It's improvised satire comedy in the vein of Spinal Tap. It was cool to see the filmmakers make such a funny and entertaining movie on a relatively low budget. Great low budget indie comedy.,1467158400,,271,4.333333333333333
8685331,5,B00OYJDKHS,"What the movie lacks in budget, it makes up for in comedy, cleverness, and...cats! But seriously, support indie film and spend the price of a cup of coffee to watch this.",1443744000,,170,4.516129032258065

8685333,5,B00OYJDKHS,"Oh my goodness, JesusCat is bizarre, quirky, funny... absolutely worth a watch or two or three.  I rented it here, but will probably buy a copy to share with friends.  Great indie comedy!",1437264000,2,187,4.636363636363637
8685334,5,B00OYJDKHS,"This is the ultimate modern satire. Laugh out loud comedy for all the recycling cat people out there. It was comforting to learn that I'm not the only human learning to speak cat, but seriously, this is a great flick.",1416009600,,217,4.45
8685335,5,B00OYJDKHS,Brilliant acting. Can't believe it was almost all improv!,1414540800,,57,5.444444444444445
