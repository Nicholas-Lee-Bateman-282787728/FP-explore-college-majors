6567830,3,B00MBVLC0I,"Most of the reviews here focus on the movie's great merits. Chances are, you already know it's a thoroughly entertaining and highly influential caper film. A classic, in other words, and one worth having in your collection.

What you're most likely to want to know is how good the Blu-ray is. Well -- to ""steal"" an element from the movie -- I'll say it's no gem. This is a bare-bones release, and the picture quality is sporadically disappointing.

The primary issue is that inferior-print shots are inserted in several scenes, most notably the one involving the police interrogation of Peter Ustinov's character. They take you out of the movie. And startlingly, for the epilogue at the end, the image suddenly shifts down to a letterbox format.

I've encountered similar patchwork issues with Olive Films as well, but that distributor tends to focus on minor films, in which case one can understand how there might not be a better print available. But ""Topkapi,"" a top-drawer film? It deserves much better. I've got to believe there's a superior print somewhere.

Luckily, the most important section of the film -- the museum break-in -- is in great shape, so our concentration is never broken there. And the disc's audio quality is fine.

Now let's talk about the extras. There aren't any (unless you count the trailer, which I don't). Here again, ""Topkapi"" deserves better. It merits the Criterion treatment, rather than what Kino Lorber provides here. Interestingly, Wikipedia currently notes, ""Similar in many respects to The Criterion Collection, releases by Kino are usually restored versions with substantial supplementary material."" That couldn't be further from the truth in this case.",1416096000,21,1695,5.1268115942028984
6567831,5,B00MBVLC0I,"Topkapi is by far one of my favorite movies. Great story by Eric Ambler (The Light of Day), excellent screen adaptation, fine cast and superb direction. The story is filled with intrigue, infused with comedic overtones, and ends with a great lead-in to a sequel that never happened. The cast for this movie could never be duplicated or topped.",1415232000,3,343,4.830508474576271
6567832,4,B00MBVLC0I,A terrific comedy with a superb international cast. Good Blu-Ray edition.,1413331200,3,73,5.7272727272727275
6567833,4,B00MBVLC0I,"Marvelous escapism. The acting is first rate and it strikes a nice balance between humor and adventure. It is one of those great caper films where you root for the crooks to get away with the crime and enjoy the accidents that disrupt the ""perfect crime"". Lot's of fun! The Blu-ray could have been better. No bonus features outside of the trailer. If you have it on DVD, it might be best to pass this offering.",1413331200,8,410,4.407894736842105
6567834,5,B00MBVLC0I,"Beyond having a realistic scenario, what makes or breaks a caper are the characters: they have to be funny, smart, manipulative, and self-destructive. By this measure, there simply isn't a better caper film. Even my kids, who prefer films made after 2000, watched this and laughed along with us, the old parents.

The caper is to replace a priceless artifact in a museum with a fake. The masterminds, the charming and brilliant Schell and the seductive Mercouri, unite a motley crew of amateurs, starting with Ustinov, a sleazy twit exploiter of tourists. Schell plans every detail meticulously, with many contingencies should complications arise, which he must continually re-set in the face of the screwups of his colleagues. First, Ustinov is arrested at the border and is drafted into spying on the group, though he gets co-opted into their vision. Then the muscle man is injured, so Ustinov must replace him. Finally, they have to speed up their schedule because the intelligence services think they are planing something later.

Perhaps the most arresting scene in the film is the precision operation in the museum itself. Really fun, scary, and lives up to the maxim that any time you plan a crime, 50 things can go wrong, 25 if you're a genius.

This is not a film to have on in the background, but one that deserves the viewer's full attention. Warmly recommended.",1413072000,7,1373,4.935064935064935
6567835,5,B00MBVLC0I,"Upgrading to this new release of Jules Dassin's thrilling, sexy, funny caper ""Topkapi"" with its edge-of-your-seat suspense.  To those who don't know this film you are in for a fun filled and very satisfying experience.  A super duper cast headed by the sultry, just oozing with sexuality Melina Mercouri (aka Mrs. Dassin), the devilishly charming Maximilian Schell, the bumbling hilarious Peter Ustinov (winning his second Academy Award for this film), the delightful and very British Robert Morley and that ""parrot"" plus great supporting players, oily Akim Tamiroff, athletic Gilles Segal and strongman Jess Hahn all adding to the fun and thrills.
Based on a book by the prolific and brilliant author Eric Ambler, it is partly a return to Dassin's most famous film, his 1955 masterpiece ""Rififi"" with the plotting and execution of a perfect robbery but this time done with relentless comedy and color.  The incredible robbery sequence involving a priceless artifact in the Topkapi museum in Istanbul matches his earlier film for utter ingenuity and suspense. Aided by stunningly beautiful location filming in Turkey and Greece by ace cinematographer Henri Alekan and the pulsating, infectious music of Manos Hadjidakis, this is one of the greatest of all caper films.  A sheer delight that never once lets up in its two hours of fun and excitement.

Once into watching it I realized I had seen it years ago and hated it then. The psychedelic sixties were not as great to those of us who actually lived through them - although they say that if you can remember the sixties, you weren't really there. This time around the movie seemed better than last time - this time I didn't hate it,  I just couldn't wait for it to be over. Unlike others, I thought the blu-ray is an upgrade from the last time I saw it - the colors were brighter and many scenes were clearer. But it is nowhere near demo quality.",1423699200,,659,4.272

6567855,4,B00MBVLC0I,"A very congenial and elaborate heist film shot in color in and around Istanbul. What makes ""TOPKAPI"" so entertaining (in addition to its locale and color photography) is its cast of truly odd-ball characters assembled by Melina Mercouri and Maximillian Schell to participate in the theft of a jewel-encrusted dagger from the Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul - Peter Ustinov,Robert Morley and Akim Tamirov(playing a perpetually drunk housekeeper at the home where the group lives while planning and rehearsing each detail of the proposed heist).In addition,the participants include an amazingly agile mute young man(Giles Segal) who performs the actual
heist at the film's nail-biting climax. I think it is fair to state that in ""TOPKAPI"" the pleasure lies in the details so sit back,relax and let the film come to you.",1416182400,,819,5.259541984732825
8671536,4,B00MBVLC0I,"I disagree with A Customer. I recall standing on, I think, 3rd or Lex in the around 57th, hoping to get into this film on its initial release. It was quite a hit, one of Dassin's last. Charming, colorful (with the great Henri Alekan's superb color  cinematography of Istanbul) and a tremendous cast featuring Morley, Tamiroff, Ustinov and, of course, heading it all the great Mercouri and Max Schell. Cleverly plotted, with that grand museum theft copied by Mission Impossible 1, and a delicious score by the reliably terrific Manos Hadjidakis (Never on Sunday). Those who love Rififfi will not be disappointed by this lighter take by the director of that earlier French masterpiece. It's true that Mercouri's accent is sometimes difficult, but seldom impenetrable. It's quite sexy, and certainly not unattactive as A Customer described it. I do think, however, subtitles would have helped. Minor quibble. This new anamorphic Kino transfer is infinitely better than the previous nonanamorphic MGM disc.",1531872000,,1002,5.22360248447205

8671542,3,B00MBVLC0I,"Most people will likely be disappointed in this movie.  If you have not seen it before here is a rundown on those who might want to consider avoiding it:
(1) If you got this because it was directed by Jules Dassin and thought this would be like the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rififi-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B00GBT629C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rififi (Criterion Collection) (Blu-ray + DVD)</a>, it is not.  Not even close.  Other than both having ""capers"" in them, the tone, quality, everything is totally different.  Unless you were told Dassin directed it, you never would have remotely guessed it.
(2) If you are under 30.  I am not, and really like movies from the 60s (Topkapi is 1964).  But even for me, the first 15 minutes or so of the movie was painful based on the overuse of disco light special effects and a hard to understand monologue in a very thick and unattractive accent.  Vast majority of young folks will find it way too cheesy (I disliked the first 1/4 and found the last 3/4 interesting mostly from a historical perspective).
(3) Those who read the official description of it being ""a skillfull blend of romance and comedy"".  I was OK with it not having any romance, but there was zero romance here. Anyone looking for romance, or hoping this could be a good date night movie, will be disappointed. The official description of the movie over exagerates just about everything in the real movie.
(4) Listening to the hype of this movie being the genesis to Oceans 11, etc.  Yes, that is partly true, and you can see it in spots. Maybe it was as groundbreaking for the time as some say.  But by today's standards, it really has not held up well (again, I enjoy most older movies).

What did it having going for it?  It does have a good cast. It can be funny at times. And there are just enough moments where you see how other later movies borrowed from it that it will give film buffs a smile.  But mostly when you see them it reminds you just how much better those more recent movies are, not just due to time, but to execution as well.  If not for the cast and the final heist scene this would be a two star affair.

The bluray is not great, but I'm sure it is an upgrade over what else is out there. I found it highly watchable on the big screen with no major complaints for a film this age.  If you've seen this before and liked it, and debating on the bluray, I wouldn't hesitate to get it.",1475280000,4,2485,4.665137614678899
