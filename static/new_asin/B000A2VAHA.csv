8324023,5,B000A2VAHA,"I love this CD! My favorites are tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12. And the DVD is even better.  You can dance with him on track 12 (Bishop Neal's Praise). All I can say is make room on your Ipod for this CD because there are a lot of gems on it.",1205884800,,244,3.4363636363636365
