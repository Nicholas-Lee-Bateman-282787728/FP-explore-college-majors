8142751,5,B000I0RPF0,"The teachings in this video are meant to teach you meditation, whether you are a Buddhist or not, so they can have a wide appeal.  Meditation can be beneficial for people who don't examine the Buddhist thinking.  I would say ""belief"" but Buddhism isn't about establishing doctrine.  The dharma is the practical teachings that help lead one towards enlightenment.  The only question is whether it's helpful to you.  You are not asked to squeeze into a prefabricated box.  Buddhism is about self-liberation, not conforming to the revelation of another.

Meditation is very much important to me.  To watch a DVD that aspires to passing on this wisdom is very precious to me. I appreciated the clear and concise instruction, even after all these years of meditation.

This DVD covers all the basic, and includes some lovely images.  The whole thing can be watched as a kind of video meditation, and indeed does include a 20 minute led meditation at the end.

If I had to criticize such a worthy effort, I would criticize the form.  I believe it's useful to have a live teacher.  Perhaps you like to hit the ground running when you go to a teacher--then this video will be helpful to you.  Perhaps you don't live near any meditation teachers.  This video will be sufficient to teach you meditation, but then I might suggest you go somewhere on line to learn meditation with feedback, like the Wildmind web sight.  Even if you're not face to face, you can at least send and receive messages about your all important experience and what you make of those experiences, in meditation.

I found the visuals around the 5 hindrances as complicated and distracting when perhaps I would want simplicity.  The explication of the 5 hinderances is not as clear and tight as the rest of the DVD's instructions because it doesn't provide the traditional antidotes, and ways of working with them.  Another reason to get a live teacher.

Yet overall this is an extremely tight, concise and clear set of instructions and guidelines that will cover what you need to know about beginning meditation with a mindfulness of breathing meditation.",1193443200,15,2118,4.830555555555556
