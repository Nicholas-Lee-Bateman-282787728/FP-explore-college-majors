7801884,5,1934347329,"I am a first kyu student of Ohshima Shotokan karate, who has resumed practice after a long hiatus. This video provided me a valuable review and will provide a solid foundation to beginning students. Students at all levels will find something of use in this video, but most certainly any kyu student should carefully study this video and practice its contents. [I do not presume to speak for dan students, but anyone who knows Tom Muzila even just by reputation will take his offerings seriously.]

Those who have not heard of Tom Muzila or are unfamiliar with Ohshima Shotokan karate will also benefit from this video-- just realize that this is basic, but serious, instruction and not a lot of flashy, impractical techniques.",1394928000,,726,4.902439024390244
