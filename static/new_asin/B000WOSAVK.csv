2988643,4,B000WOSAVK,"Kathy Smith has put together 5 different ab workouts that are each 10 minutes.  The DVD breaks down like this:

1) 10 min Standing ABS - working with some dance-like moves that strengthen the core and work your abs.
2) 10 min Core ABS - this is usually the one I do. It is moves on the ground that work your abs all over.
3) 10 min Boot camp ABS - a more challenging workout.
4) 10 minute Stability ball ABS - working with a stability ball.
5) Pilates mat ABS - this workout is pretty good as well.

I found all of her ab workouts to be ok; the one drawback that I found to all some of her exercises is that you have to be fairly light to do some of them. For example, you are on your knees with one leg stretched out behind you and one arm stretched out - well this is great for the abs and your core but if you have extra weight on you, it's hard to do.  I ended up getting some great ideas from her AB DVD and now I just do a workout on the floor of a variety of some of the great exercises that are on the DVD.

I normally do my ABS at the end of my aerobic and strength training workout and it's great-finishes it off nicely.",1202688000,54,1130,3.853448275862069
2988644,4,B000WOSAVK,"I was so excited to finally see a new release workout from Kathy - I haven't seen or bought a new one for ages from her.  This whole workout is geared around your abs and you work them hard in various styles and for various lengths of time.  You can try and do the entire workout, or pick and choose what you want to do and how much time you have to do it in.
There are five 10-13 minute segments and the first which tones as well as warms you up, is done standing.  Then the rest are done in various styles such as pilates and bootcamp and a segment with a stability ball and plank and stabilization moves.
I found this not quite as good as doing straight 10 minutes on the floor (for some reason).  I think I prefer to get in and then straight out without using stability balls or doing pilates.  I have to say though, that I certainly felt this the next day and I will make every attempt to do at least two segments, three times a week.  Kathy is always a great cuer and she's outgoing and encouraging and I always find that an extra bonus.",1197936000,89,1043,4.088235294117647

2988665,4,B000WOSAVK,"I bought this awhile ago and haven't used it for awhile - it's been very rainy where I  Iive and  haven't been able to do my normal outside roller bladding.  I did another workout aerobic video and decided to end with Tummy Trimmers while my heat rate was still up. The standing ab ""warm up"" she uses is fast but the moves are hard and so different than traditional sit ups on the floor.  The 2nd part which is core and I was having a problem seeing what she was doing as I was using my computer on the desk, should have used my laptop and placed it besides me,  I didn't do the boot camp or the the one using the ball.

I do realize, that only time will make me more- how do I say, balanced so that I can be able to do the exercises on this dvd. I am not balanced. At all. I got this dvd with an Everlast slimming belt to help lose extra baby weight gained during pregnancy. I'll be honest, when it comes to the part where you're doing pushups on your elbows, I wanted to die. The bootcamp portion of the video is definitely not for the novice workout person. I can tell you this, after the first segment (the intro/warm up) you'll already know what to expect from the rest of the dvd- sweat, tears, and maybe some blood. Ok, no blood...but you'll feel the burn in your body. And what can I say, I did lose like 5 lbs so far....but it's not entirely because of this dvd (eating right, better health habits also helped).",1365897600,,872,4.227544910179641

2988677,3,B000WOSAVK,"I got this for my wife. Her other workout videos were getting a little repetitive, so she wanted me to find something to help her switch things up. Unfortunately she didn't really like Kathy's style of instruction. My wife likes a personal, more concentrated workout experience, but she felt Kathy was a bit too hyper and peppy at time for her taste.

Personally, I don't think she gave it enough of a chance, but no need in working out to a video you can't warm up to.

To compare, she has been using Jin Miller's Kettle-bell workout for a couple of years now.",1359504000,,561,4.436893203883495

2988681,5,B000WOSAVK,"I was a little skeptical since I'd done abs videos before, lost a little waist, but then seemed to have gained it back.  I do this workout two to three times a week.  I do three workouts (30 minutes) and I've already lost 2"" in my waist in the three months since I started using the workout tape.  As you can well imagine this makes a huge difference in my wardrobe!

The cueing is great.  Kathy is very enthusiastic and encouraging.  Also liked that they showed different body types and you didn't just have the super thin anorexic types I used to see when I did the Jane Fonda videos in the 80's.

This video is a must!  In my mind, it's the next best thing to a personal trainer (for those of us who can't afford it).",1348185600,3,720,4.166666666666667

My favorites are Core Abs, Boot Camp Abs and Stability Ball Abs.  There are a lot of crunches but enough unique moves to keep my interest. This is my only Kathy Smith dvd and I think her coaching is motivating without being too chirpy or overly hyper.

I work out at home only - and I am impressed by the variety of core work outs for this DVD.  The name of the DVD should be 5 core workouts - if you have 10 minutes.  The Boot Camp workout is the toughest! To her credit, she really keeps the pace moving and, as always, provides a modified move for beginners.

The program provides enough variety and challenge that you are sure to improve your core strength and toning.

Here's the line-up, each one is 10 minutes:
Standing Abs
Core Abs
Boot Camp Abs
Stability Ball Abs

2988694,5,B000WOSAVK,"Perennial fitness favorite Kathy Smith has created a tough workout focused on your midsection. Everyone from beginners to seasoned fitness enthusiasts will be pushed to do their personal best with this DVD.

This workout DVD has five, 10-minute workouts. The five workouts are:
Standing Abs
Core Abs
Boot Camp Abs
Stability Ball Abs
Pilates Mat Abs

There is no dedicated warm-up or cool-down on this disc, but the Standing Abs section works well to warm up. There are some light stretches at the end of each segment, but this is not a cool down. For this reason, you will want to use this workout as a piece of your overall routine which includes stretching.

The setting of the DVD is a fitness room. The background has an Eastern flair, using a round, orange circle backdrop over a pool of rock-lined water. The walls have bunches of bamboo spaced around the edges.

Kathy exercises with a diverse group of people in this workout. There are people of many age groups, from a man in his 20's to women in their 40's. This is not a group of people with rock hard abs, many people in the group don't even show their midriff. You will be encouraged as Kathy shows you several levels for some exercises, as well as provides instruction on what mistakes to watch out for.

The exercises are challening. From standing crunches, planks and old-fashioned crunches to newer moves like cross chops and Pilates, your body will be pushed.

If you are looking to 'get a six pack' of abs, bear in mind that all the core toning in the world will not give you definition in your midsection without incorporating good nutrition and fat burning. If you have toned abs, you cannot see them if you have layers of stored fat on top of them. For this reason, you will want to use this workout as part of an overall fitness routine that incorporates plenty of cardio, back strengthening and overall body toning.",1235520000,5,1889,4.623880597014925
2988704,5,B000WOSAVK,"This is a great workout! I like the fact that it has five different options that you can choose from. In addition, you can mix, combine your workout. You also can use new methods or stick with the old ways of working out the abs. I love is dvd.",1234828800,,244,4.0
2988705,5,B000WOSAVK,"I have been using this video for a couple of weeks now, and it is wonderful! Especially on the bootcamp abs, I can feel muscles I never knew were there!

2988708,5,B000WOSAVK,"The abdominal exercises in this workout video may appear ordinary and mild, but they are really very effective, especially the way Kathy Smith has sequenced the movements. Since there are five workouts, if you do the first workout along with one of the other four, you are getting a good abdominal workout as well as a cardio workout.

Frankly, these workouts flattened and toned my abs much more than some harder and more vigorous videos I have tried. I think it is because Kathy Smith uncovers the most useful exercises around and then fine tunes them so that the exercises hit a specific spot.

It is also nice to try a workout that doesn't feel like it's going to kill you at the end. I usually would do a forty minute walk and then twenty minutes of this video afterwards. It worked even better after some cardio.",1231804800,2,818,4.557823129251701
2988709,5,B000WOSAVK,"I was kind of wary about buying this DVD for a long time, but now I am really glad I did.

This DVD features 5 short ab workouts that can be done separately or together in any combination (which you can program before beginning). I really enjoyed Kathy Smith's older tape Ultimate Abs and Thighs.  The ab work on it was stupendous, but the work on this one is every bit as good and includes much more.

Standing Abs is actually one of the better Standing Abs workouts I've seen in a mainstream fitness release.  The moves are really fun and feature a decent amount of repetitions to help get your heart rate up and burn fat.  A lot of these moves also focused on lengthening the abs, which is not an area many instructors emphasize.

The other four segments feature a very good combination of more typical stomach moves broken into core work, bootcamp abs, stability ball abs, and Pilates Abs.  Some examples from the segments include: Planks, V-sits, crunches, single leg and double-leg straight.

I have good abdominal muscles, but the full length of this workout left me sore the next day - a very good sore mind you!

I think you will enjoy it!

Note:  I really have no idea why Lions Gate feels the need to Airbrush Kathy Smith or Denise Austin to within an inch of their life.  Kathy is so nice looking within this DVD that why they fixed the cover picture the way they did is beyond me.  I notice that on the cover of her latest release Total Body Lift, she is back to looking like a human being, not a mannequin.",1231286400,11,1520,4.385714285714286

2988712,5,B000WOSAVK,"I'm not a Kathy Smith fan at all. I think her older workouts are just annoying and she always looked too ""top-heavy"". I exercise every day and have hundreds of DVDs, because I'm always on the lookout for the next great workout to a point of addiction. So when I saw this one, it looked appealing enough that I bought it. I'm so glad I did. I love it! The variety is great and the timing of each workout perfect to add on to a cardio or strength session. Kathy looks so much better at this age than when she was younger, well proportioned, very inspiring. She is also very calming and pleasant on this DVD. I feel really good after doing one of these ab workouts.",1206489600,31,662,4.2204724409448815
2988713,5,B000WOSAVK,"I've been a big Kathy Smith fan for many years. I was also excited to see this new release. I was somewhat nervous that it would be a combination of many of her other workouts only re-released under a different name. It was NOT! There are 5 different workouts to chose from; some are familiar moves from previous DVD's but the majority were exercises I had not seen before and were incredible! True to Kathy, she has one person in the class doing the 'beginner' versions which really helped. After all these years, Kathy still has it!",1203206400,52,534,4.515463917525773
3223140,4,B000WOSAVK,"Kathy Smith has put together 5 different ab workouts that are each 10 minutes.  The DVD breaks down like this:

1) 10 min Standing ABS - working with some dance-like moves that strengthen the core and work your abs.
2) 10 min Core ABS - this is usually the one I do. It is moves on the ground that work your abs all over.
3) 10 min Boot camp ABS - a more challenging workout.
4) 10 minute Stability ball ABS - working with a stability ball.
5) Pilates mat ABS - this workout is pretty good as well.

I found all of her ab workouts to be ok; the one drawback that I found to all some of her exercises is that you have to be fairly light to do some of them. For example, you are on your knees with one leg stretched out behind you and one arm stretched out - well this is great for the abs and your core but if you have extra weight on you, it's hard to do.  I ended up getting some great ideas from her AB DVD and now I just do a workout on the floor of a variety of some of the great exercises that are on the DVD.

I normally do my ABS at the end of my aerobic and strength training workout and it's great-finishes it off nicely.",1202688000,54,1130,3.853448275862069
3223141,4,B000WOSAVK,"I was so excited to finally see a new release workout from Kathy - I haven't seen or bought a new one for ages from her.  This whole workout is geared around your abs and you work them hard in various styles and for various lengths of time.  You can try and do the entire workout, or pick and choose what you want to do and how much time you have to do it in.
There are five 10-13 minute segments and the first which tones as well as warms you up, is done standing.  Then the rest are done in various styles such as pilates and bootcamp and a segment with a stability ball and plank and stabilization moves.
I found this not quite as good as doing straight 10 minutes on the floor (for some reason).  I think I prefer to get in and then straight out without using stability balls or doing pilates.  I have to say though, that I certainly felt this the next day and I will make every attempt to do at least two segments, three times a week.  Kathy is always a great cuer and she's outgoing and encouraging and I always find that an extra bonus.",1197936000,89,1043,4.088235294117647

The standing ab ""warm up"" she uses is fast but the moves are hard and so different than traditional sit ups on the floor.

I'll be honest, when it comes to the part where you're doing pushups on your elbows, I wanted to die. The bootcamp portion of the video is definitely not for the novice workout person. I can tell you this, after the first segment (the intro/warm up) you'll already know what to expect from the rest of the dvd- sweat, tears, and maybe some blood. Ok, no blood...but you'll feel the burn in your body.

The cueing is great.  Kathy is very enthusiastic and encouraging.  Also liked that they showed different body types and you didn't just have the super thin anorexic types I used to see when I did the Jane Fonda videos in the 80's.

3223191,5,B000WOSAVK,"Perennial fitness favorite Kathy Smith has created a tough workout focused on your midsection. Everyone from beginners to seasoned fitness enthusiasts will be pushed to do their personal best with this DVD.

This workout DVD has five, 10-minute workouts. The five workouts are:
Standing Abs
Core Abs
Boot Camp Abs
Stability Ball Abs
Pilates Mat Abs

There is no dedicated warm-up or cool-down on this disc, but the Standing Abs section works well to warm up. There are some light stretches at the end of each segment, but this is not a cool down. For this reason, you will want to use this workout as a piece of your overall routine which includes stretching.

The setting of the DVD is a fitness room. The background has an Eastern flair, using a round, orange circle backdrop over a pool of rock-lined water. The walls have bunches of bamboo spaced around the edges.

Kathy exercises with a diverse group of people in this workout. There are people of many age groups, from a man in his 20's to women in their 40's. This is not a group of people with rock hard abs, many people in the group don't even show their midriff. You will be encouraged as Kathy shows you several levels for some exercises, as well as provides instruction on what mistakes to watch out for.

The exercises are challening. From standing crunches, planks and old-fashioned crunches to newer moves like cross chops and Pilates, your body will be pushed.

If you are looking to 'get a six pack' of abs, bear in mind that all the core toning in the world will not give you definition in your midsection without incorporating good nutrition and fat burning. If you have toned abs, you cannot see them if you have layers of stored fat on top of them. For this reason, you will want to use this workout as part of an overall fitness routine that incorporates plenty of cardio, back strengthening and overall body toning.",1235520000,5,1889,4.623880597014925

3223205,5,B000WOSAVK,"The abdominal exercises in this workout video may appear ordinary and mild, but they are really very effective, especially the way Kathy Smith has sequenced the movements. Since there are five workouts, if you do the first workout along with one of the other four, you are getting a good abdominal workout as well as a cardio workout.

Frankly, these workouts flattened and toned my abs much more than some harder and more vigorous videos I have tried. I think it is because Kathy Smith uncovers the most useful exercises around and then fine tunes them so that the exercises hit a specific spot.

It is also nice to try a workout that doesn't feel like it's going to kill you at the end. I usually would do a forty minute walk and then twenty minutes of this video afterwards. It worked even better after some cardio.",1231804800,2,818,4.557823129251701
3223206,5,B000WOSAVK,"I was kind of wary about buying this DVD for a long time, but now I am really glad I did.

This DVD features 5 short ab workouts that can be done separately or together in any combination (which you can program before beginning). I really enjoyed Kathy Smith's older tape Ultimate Abs and Thighs.  The ab work on it was stupendous, but the work on this one is every bit as good and includes much more.

Standing Abs is actually one of the better Standing Abs workouts I've seen in a mainstream fitness release.  The moves are really fun and feature a decent amount of repetitions to help get your heart rate up and burn fat.  A lot of these moves also focused on lengthening the abs, which is not an area many instructors emphasize.

The other four segments feature a very good combination of more typical stomach moves broken into core work, bootcamp abs, stability ball abs, and Pilates Abs.  Some examples from the segments include: Planks, V-sits, crunches, single leg and double-leg straight.

I have good abdominal muscles, but the full length of this workout left me sore the next day - a very good sore mind you!

I think you will enjoy it!

Note:  I really have no idea why Lions Gate feels the need to Airbrush Kathy Smith or Denise Austin to within an inch of their life.  Kathy is so nice looking within this DVD that why they fixed the cover picture the way they did is beyond me.  I notice that on the cover of her latest release Total Body Lift, she is back to looking like a human being, not a mannequin.",1231286400,11,1520,4.385714285714286

3223208,5,B000WOSAVK,"I love the variety of this DVD.  I also like the short workouts ~ I like to do this DVD after weight lifting or another workout to just target my abs.  You can combine these shorter routines for a longer workout, too.",1222732800,6,217,4.142857142857143
3223209,5,B000WOSAVK,"I'm not a Kathy Smith fan at all. I think her older workouts are just annoying and she always looked too ""top-heavy"". I exercise every day and have hundreds of DVDs, because I'm always on the lookout for the next great workout to a point of addiction. So when I saw this one, it looked appealing enough that I bought it. I'm so glad I did. I love it! The variety is great and the timing of each workout perfect to add on to a cardio or strength session. Kathy looks so much better at this age than when she was younger, well proportioned, very inspiring. She is also very calming and pleasant on this DVD. I feel really good after doing one of these ab workouts.",1206489600,31,662,4.2204724409448815
3223210,5,B000WOSAVK,"I've been a big Kathy Smith fan for many years. I was also excited to see this new release. I was somewhat nervous that it would be a combination of many of her other workouts only re-released under a different name. It was NOT! There are 5 different workouts to chose from; some are familiar moves from previous DVD's but the majority were exercises I had not seen before and were incredible! True to Kathy, she has one person in the class doing the 'beginner' versions which really helped. After all these years, Kathy still has it!",1203206400,52,534,4.515463917525773

8224541,5,B000WOSAVK,"I am a 60-year-old woman who needed a bit of work in the tummy department. Kathy Smith's exercises are varied and challenging. I do one short 15-minute workout from the five different ones on this DVD each day after I do cardio exercises for 45 minutes.  The variety is great, and the results have been great for me. I have loved Kathy Smith's DVDs since I was a young mother of 3 small children. She came through again, even after all of these years!",1494201600,,451,4.369047619047619

8224543,4,B000WOSAVK,"I love this workout. The best part about it is that there's not a huge amount of reps per exercise. This is important to me because I have neck problems and too many crunches sometimes makes my neck sore, despite my efforts to relax and not pull on my neck to do my crunches. I really like the different options for working your abs too. My favorite is exercising abs on the stability ball.",1482883200,,390,4.283783783783784
