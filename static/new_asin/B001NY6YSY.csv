8328219,3,B001NY6YSY,"Frank Whaley who has acted in many films like ""Field of Dreams"" directed and wrote his third feature.  He has a cameo in the movie as the jumpy little limo driver Les who wields a clipboard jammed with colored pieces of paper.  Freddy Prinze Jr. plays a budding filmmaker named Owen whose six-minute short gets invited to a festival, although one wonders why, from the atrocious mugging of Chris Klein.  Klein plays Owen's best friend Ray who has a taste for booze and an aversion to responsibility.  Owen is engaged to Lynn.  Unfortunately, the two don't seem to have great chemistry.  Ray persuades Owen to ditch his fiancee and crash a party, where Owen seduces Rachel and then gets in a romantic jam.  The two buddies fly to a film festival where they meet actor Wallace Shawn playing himself.  The guys' relationship collapses in a good scene for Prinze where he dresses Ray down.  I found myself impatient with the film, wondering why both guys were such jerks.  The film then has a coda 18 months later where the guys run into each other and spend quite a while remembering how they used to be best friends.  The film has great intentions and has some nice moments.  It's an interesting independent effort about men growing up to be adults.  Enjoy!",1250121600,,1255,4.65
8328220,2,B001NY6YSY,"Freddie Prinze Jr goes for another NYC light drama/light comedy piece, his second in as many years, and once again it fell quite flat. I cannot short him in one instance towards the end when he lets loose into a tirade that probably showcases his talent better than those films combined; a rare little gem for him. Otherwise the writing tanked this from the get-go.

We have a story surrounding four friends plugging their way through bachelorhood in the city. Through the coarse of two trips we suffer their ""bonding"" time, one involving all four to a friend's funeral, and another with just Klein's and Prinze's characters showcasing at a film festival. The writing was so inconsistent that the film could not decide what it wanted to be. We get 20 minutes of character intro about how this group will go to underage parties for sex, steal random stuff, cheat on a fiance, and so on - but when one of the guys tries to take valuables offered to him, his buddies get upset..? The first real laugh was apparently the fart in the car joke 29 minutes into it, or maybe it was Klein playing the perpetual drunk that ignores his young daughter. There were some significant errors towards the end of the film also, but I think one can get the point. In the end, it appeared to be about man friends finding they are better people apart than together. Jamie Lynn Sigler had the victim role, and her parts were too brief for this to be a reference for her.

There are several extras on the disc to help show some production material and background. But the tell tale sign for me is when there are over 20 copies (now 70) for sale here dirt cheap in two weeks.",1238803200,3,1651,4.4635761589403975
