At Bako National Park in Sarawak, the rangers even show this video in the Information Centre! As with most National Geographic titles, the footage is beautifully captured, and the incredible sounds (birds singing, water flowing, silence) of the jungle and mangrove are captured to a stirring effect. The video also guides the viewer through the stages of the day in a mangrove swamp, since the tides are an integral and strong current in the whole equation. From top to bottom, the forest canopy is covered, and the viewer is left with a general understanding how and why the mudskipper needs the fiddler crab needs the macaque needs the proboscis monkey needs the mangrove tree. At the end, it is noted that we humans need the mangrove too, as a reminder that all ecologies are ultimately and intimately connected.",991699200,3,973,4.867469879518072
