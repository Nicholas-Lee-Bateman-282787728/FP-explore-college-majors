1844162,5,B00008G8MC,"If you are you are reading this review, chances are it is from the privileged side of the digital divide. You're probably using a laptop at a caf. Maybe you're using your personal computer at work or at home. Not too far from you, there's a kid who laments their sheltered life. There's a James Dean or a Holden Caulfield who is confronting the numbing insanity of a prosperous American childhood. This kid is growing up a lot like I did, with a full belly and not much to do. They have out-of-touch adult authorities who enforce a dull reality. Just for a day, they wish they could go experience life on the street. They wish they could explore booze and cigarettes and all the other things they aren't allowed to do. They see kids at school who are less supervised. Those kids have so much more fun in life. This kid is depressed. Home does not meet their expectations, even if it fulfills their material needs. She feels trapped by not chasing her expectations of a rich and interesting life in clubs, drugs, and intimacy. Maybe he wants to find out what it's like to be addicted. Maybe she actually believe that parties exist like the ones they stage on sitcoms. Maybe he just stares at cool kids out his parents' minivan window and believes they have a better life.

You need to find this kid and force them to watch Edet Belzberg's Children Underground. Why is it important for kids who grew up like I did to watch a documentary about homeless children in Romania? I'm not sure. The film has a way of sobering any fantasies about street life and addiction. I can't describe what it's like to see these children puff away at plastic bags filled with paint thinner as middle-class adults nonchalantly pass them. Kids of all ages puff away at cigarettes and cut themselves, but it's not rebellious. It's not ""cool"" or ""Goth"" or ""Emo"" or a cultural accessory to being ""deep"" or ""thoughtful."" It isn't ""stupid"" or able to fit within moralistic or social-Darwinist jargon. It is naked poverty and naked mental illness. All of the judgment and persona that American culture invests in poverty and illness seems to melt in the testimony of Romanian children.

Perhaps this documentary is so moving because the ""face"" of poverty in American popular culture is adult and non-white. This is an illusion but it frames the way in which we think of social ills. Young, white preteens aren't supposed to live lives of drugs, violence, and homelessness. At least, we aren't supposed to see these lives. I'm pretty sure that there are kids in Chicago, New York, and Seattle whose lives aren't unlike those of these children in Bucharest. Maybe you and I step over them in the Subway without noticing. Maybe we see those eyes in the face of a young stranger and resolve not to do anything about it. Of course, not all good intention has good consequence. The film is also a critique of charities and social services that can be woefully inept at meeting the childrens' needs. Good individuals are undermined by flawed bureaucracy.

Children Underground does not raise complex problems and placate the viewer with simple answers. One wishes the hardware store would stop selling the kids paint to snuff until they drool and spasm. One wishes the state would stop trying to place kids back in homes that they identify as abusive. One wishes that birth control was affirmed as a human right. Belzberg gives a glimpse of the human condition that undermines the way in which American culture relates to the body through commodity and desire. Like the best cinema, the subtext for the audience makes the main text profound.",1161561600,7,3605,4.709984152139461
1844163,5,B00008G8MC,"i think this movie, although depressing, was a good example of the survival instinct manifested in children. Maybe in some sort of perverted way i thought that these children would become expert in the ways of survival, and that this experience could be a positive in their lives as they got older. These kids were being knoked around early in life and this, hopefully, would only make them stronger granting them a true picture of reality and the dog eat dog lifestyle of capitalism. These kids are a model for the capitalist system that encourages a rugged darwinian individualism. A part of me wishes that I would have spent a few years on the street like these kids (sans the Aurolac if possible). If anything we should admire these children for their incredible innocent strength...this is urban primitivism and liberty at its best especially when contrasted with those fat and ugly pampered Bucharetians chillin' at Sydney's cafe...",1156464000,3,938,4.980891719745223
1844164,5,B00008G8MC,"This powerful look at the utterly desolate lives of small band of Romanian street kids can be taken at face value as a condemnation of the policies of a brutal dictator. But it also speaks volumes about the realities of parents forced (by the Romanian government, in this case) to have unwanted children. The film can be divided into three acts. The first unflinchingly examines the children's daily lives in a subway station, begging for food, money, and water, and sniffing paint. The only upbeat aspect is the occasional joy that the children find in ordinary, childlike play-wading in a pond or playing tag. The second part reveals the dysfunctional families from which the children have either run away or been sent away. In one case, we learn that one of the boys is escaping an abusive father. He misses his sister but is too afraid of his father to even go near the house when a social worker tries to take him there. In another family, the mother has obviously shunned her son and daughter at the behest of her new husband. For me, the most heartbreaking scenes occurs here: A charity worker takes them home to see if the parents will take the children back, but the mother and step-father rationalize the kids' life on the streets; they can make more money there, they say. Then even this facade crumbles as it becomes obvious that the parents simply don't want the kids in their lives. The third part revisits the group after a gap of one year. We see that many of the younger kids have been taken up by charity organizations (which see them as having the best chance for rehabilitation), whereas the ending is not so happy for the older kids. This is a deeply saddening film but a must-see look at the misery created by a heartless government and irresponsible, thoughtless parents. This film and each of the children in it will stay with you forever. --MellowMonk.com",1133654400,9,1880,4.6656626506024095
1844165,3,B00008G8MC,"This documentary has a lot going for it, and one serious flaw. The filming is intriguing and insightful, getting the viewer into the lives of the children living on the streets of Bucharest (or rather under it in a subway station). It's really disturbing, too, to see commuters in stiletto heals walk unconcernedly by these children laying on makeshift cardboard beds.

Following the lives of 5 of these kids was terrible, hopeful and tearful, all at the same time. Coming from an American perspective (i.e., me), I had a hard time understanding why these children didn't have access to more resources, including ways to find a home. But, again, coming from an American background (where we have more resources than most other countries) I guess I shouldn't have been that surprised.

The serious flaw in the documentary (as another reviewer pointed out) is that there's no film time relegated to the former dictator Couseau's anti-contraceptive and anti-abortion laws that caused some of these problems (most of them, probably). I felt that the film makers should've gone to the higher ups in government and interviewed them for the documentary, allowing the viewer a chance to see where these laws were made and then (in the subway) their effects. Not doing this led to a serious imbalance in the character of what this documentary was supposed to be about.

I felt that this was more a documentary on runaways and homeless children in Bucharest than on any policies that caused these horrible situations.",1128816000,9,1507,4.99601593625498
1844166,5,B00008G8MC,"Having just seen the DVD of Children Underground I must say strongly that this film should be seen by everyone in the postmodern first world. I saw these things for myself in Romania during December of 2000. The apathy on the streets of Bucharest was deep and dark. My friends there kept shrugging their shoulders saying; ""What can you do?"" A documentary on the thousands of dogs on the streets would be a riveting nightmare in itself. While I was there they held an election. The choice of presidential candidates was reduced to a hard-line old school communist and a new school fascist. The Communist won. People shrugged. The train stations and subway entrances were indeed hives for feral children. I'm deeply grateful to Edet Belzberg for having the courage to descend into this manmade hell to bring these images back. It is my hope that the Romanians themselves find some of that same courage. I was moved that even at this stage of hell several of the kids held on to at least some idea of God. That could be seen by the cynically ironic of the West as the superstition of the hopeless, but perhaps it is also evidence that these children are not hopeless. To blame these problems on the lack of abortions or contraceptives is nave and simplistic. Listen to the voices of the parents in this film. It is the apathy, the failure of courage and the utter selfishness reinforced by too many years of soul crushing communist dictatorship. We, ourselves, have no reason to gloat. Apart from having a surfeit of material possessions would we fare any better if the props were kicked from beneath us? Perhaps, perhaps not. This film, along with Lilja 4-Ever, is a warning sign of something growing in this world. Robert L. Kaplan termed it The Coming Anarchy. It will spread.  Meanwhile how will you respond to these things? With compassion or with apathy?",1078531200,35,1857,4.713846153846154
1844167,2,B00008G8MC,"A film by Edet Belzberg
""Children Undergound"" was nominated for the Best Documentary Academy Award, and the subject of the film sounded fascinating.  The former dictator of Romania, Nicolei Ceaucescu, outlawed the use of contraceptives and abortions in order to increase Romania's workforce.  This led to 20,000 children on the street as countless families were unable to cope, and afford the unplanned children.  That is the premise of the film, as presented by the text that is on screen before the documentary actually begins, and it sounds like this will be a very interesting documentary.  Unfortunately, that's not the movie we see.
The movie we get follows five Romanian kids (with ages ranging from 8 through the teenage years) as they live on the streets.  We follow their lives, seeing where the sleep, how they get by, what they eat, where they go, and what they do.  We watch them exist in a street gang which gives them a sense of family, and a sense of security and protection.  We watch as nearly every kid huffs paint to get high, and we see some struggle to improve themselves and get off the street, despite the feeling that they are better off on the street than they are at home.
One could make the case that these kids living on the street is a direct result of Ceaucescu's policy regarding contraceptives and abortion and that these kids are representative of the 20,000 street children, and perhaps that is true.  The problem is that the documentary does not try to make that case.  The only connection with Ceaucescu's policy is the text that preceded the film telling us that 20,000 kids are on the street because of the contraceptive policy.  The film itself presents us with a different reality.  With one exception, these kids are not orphans, they are runaways.  One kid in particular had horrible parents, but that does not make him a victim of Ceaucescu's policy.  It just means that he felt that running away from home and living on the streets of Bucharest was a better alternative to living at home.
That is the major flaw of the movie.  The basic theme presented had little to do with the documentary itself.  The only time there is any connection to the presented theme was very, very late in the movie when one of the parents says that she ""was better off under Ceaucescu"".  That's it.  That is the entire connection to the contraception policy.
With that said, this is a powerful look into the lives of Bucharest's street children.  They live very rough lives and the addiction to huffing paint and drugs makes it even more difficult for them to ever really get off the street.  If this was the theme of the film and this is what was presented up front, perhaps the film would have been stronger.  Unfortunately we are presented with one idea for the documentary and given another in the film itself.
""Children Underground"" had the potential to be an excellent documentary.  Besides the above stated complaint about the presentation of the topic, there is an issue with the structure of the film.  Meaning, there is none.  The documentary goes from subject to subject and place to place without any sort of purpose, or at least none that I could figure out.  I know this is a foreign film, and perhaps the filmmaker had a different idea of what a documentary could and should be, but it was almost completely devoid of narration and just a little bit of narration could have given the film some structure.  Otherwise, I just had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was going on and when scenes were happening in relation to the previous scene.  There was a certain amount of power in the images on screen, but there was really nothing connecting them to a larger vision of the film.  ""Children Underground"" should have been a great documentary, but it turned out to be disappointing.",1075075200,16,3828,4.700149925037481
1844168,5,B00008G8MC,"I have never seen anything like what is contained in this documentary.  I am forever changed.  I bought the DVD to be enlightened about ""whatever it was"" the film was about; I never thought it would have affected me the way it did.

1844169,4,B00008G8MC,"CHILDREN UNDERGROUND follows a group of children living one subway station in Bucharest, Romania. These unwanted children exist as a result of Ceaucescus strict policy of outlaying abortions and birth control. Most grew up in orphanages while others lived with their families in dire poverty. They believe that their lives are better underground. This documentary films the daily exploits of these children along with the struggles they encounter to rehabilitate themselves. In order to attend school they must come clean and stop sniffing paint. In addition, they must have their identity papers, which are almost impossible for most of them. The most enduring parts of this film center on the interviews of the various family members of these children. Truly heartbreaking is the family of the small boy who doesnt understand why their youngest child won't return home. Watching this film will certainly make you appreciate the material things often taken for granted.",1062460800,27,970,5.34640522875817
1844170,5,B00008G8MC,"... After Nicolei Ceaucescu, former Romanian dictator, outlawed the use of contraceptives as well as abortions, many impoverished families in Romania became even more desperate. As their families grew, they were forced to leave many of their children in orphanages or...even worse..push them out into the streets and the  ""underground"" (the sewers)of Romania.
  I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen as I watched the five children portrayed here, children getting by as no children should be forced to survive - often resorting to violence, drugs and prostitution.
 This first feature film from documentarian Edet Belzberg was warmly received at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. I hope it will motivate other families to think of adopting from Romania - or, at the very least, to contributing to the many organizations which are trying to help these children.",1043884800,,861,5.262773722627737
1844248,3,B00008G8MC,"This film seems to be promoting abortion and contraception as the cures to pain and suffering and prevention of street children(and adults). Is this yet another attempt by the Liberal Brainwashing Agenda?!
It seems that if abortion had not been prevented during this certain time period then these children would not be on the street. Guess what!? It's not that simple.
Why is there no mention of the true reasons for these tragic street children?
Alcohol and the subsequent abuse of it is largely at the root of this problem. The children state that their parents get drunk and become abusive. That is the reason, maybe excuse, for many of these children running away from their homes.
Why does the film not begin with a statement about the evils of alcohol?!
Why are these children allowed to run the street like this?
Is there any mention of the fact that Godless Communism ran this country for decades and set the foundation for what transpires today?
Here the film ignores another fact for the benefit of the Lib Agenda. Churches and Christian Religion attempt to care for widows and orphans in this world. Christianity, in its truest and best form, has infused societies and cultures with ideas of compassion, mercy, and love. These same values inspire many liberals, even though the Lib Agenda is trying to eradicate Christianity, paradoxically supporting Islam!. Get real.
This film would have done better in sending it's message by having a Christian perspective. These heathen leftist communists are too shallow and misled.
This film is not for the squeamish or person who doesn't want to be disturbed. It's violent and horrifying.
Good people should not turn their backs to difficult and unjust realities as portrayed here. However, it is a deeply complex and difficult problem to be dealt with.
Part of the ""solution"" if there be such, is to be honest and wise about the true causes of street children as well as adults.
Truly, contraception and intelligence applied to the sex act is foremost. There is a sickness in a man or woman that demands intercourse with the subsequent risk of pregnancy when there is no desire for children and no wherewithal to afford it.
Abortion is a last-ditch effort and it is still NOT ACCEPTABLE OR DESIREABLE!
The idea of abortion as promoted by the Lib Agenda and Democrat Party in the US is perverted and evil.
Abortion should be safely available to females who have a true need for it and the parents of the aborted baby should be held responsible on at least a legal level for causing a baby to be killed. Abortion is not a nifty way out of a lifestyle promoted by the Lib Agenda: sexual promiscuity and destruction of the traditional family unit.",1296432000,,2697,4.802150537634408
1844249,5,B00008G8MC,"An unflinching look at children living on the margins of society. Children Underground does not sermonize, moralize, or attempt to resolve the issues that have contributed to what is apparently a pervasive problem in Romania. That is the brilliance of this film; it takes us into the world of these children and allows us to get a glimpse of the individual. Each person will come away with something different, because we are not told how to feel about what we are seeing and the children are not rescued. It is not a story of hardship and redemption. The film makers have made the hard choice not to step into the story, but are observers.  The children tell their own story. It is disturbing to see children so young literally fighting for their daily survival. It was fascinating to come to know the individual traits of each child, to see the humanity in these ""feral"" children, and to witness the resiliency of the human spirit. The children are survivors, and while some argue that they have been so damaged by life on the street and lack of nurturing attachments that they are not able to be ""rehabilitated"". In witnessing the inherent humanity of each child, it is clear that they have evolved or adapted, in order to survive. This film reminded me of ""Streetwise"", which depicted Seattle street kids circa 1984. Another great movie that doesn't seek to frame the subject in any context other than letting the characters tell their own story.",1282953600,4,1450,4.753968253968254
1844250,4,B00008G8MC,"I must tell you it was very  tough  to watch this from a emotional and a parent point of view  to see how these poor children are living. What blew me away was how the adults walking thru this subway were either  kicking and punching these kids,and how they spent their days  huffing spray  paint, sleeping on a cardboard bed, ( what must the winter's be like  in the subway ??) and drinking water from a public fountain instead  of going to school. It makes me want to hop on a plance to bring one of those kids  back here to Texas  to at least give them a chance  at life before its too late. Absolutely  fantasic film  even if the subject matter  was dark and grim.",1277164800,4,668,4.15748031496063
1844251,5,B00008G8MC,"I haven't written a review for a very, very long time; there simply hasn't been one worth writing. And after noting the lack of reviews, or seemingly brief reviews, for ""Children Underground,"" I was compelled to do so. I now understand why the majority of reviews merely repeat what we're already told about the documentary, or simply state the pertinence of viewing this. I'm not going to tell you what you've already read here, for the basic plot summary and details cannot prepare you for the viewing experience. There's simply no way I could've been prepared for ""Children Underground,"" despite my extensive collection of documentaries, many of which I thought to be deeply disturbing.

This is something you must see to believe; it takes us on an intimate journey to the darkest depths of a reality we've never even fathomed, let alone believed could exist. These children, this footage, the way in which it's filmed, the lack of narration, lack of any pre-text besides the initial text at the beginning of the documentary (which I noticed several viewers critiqued), all make this one of the most riveting, engrossing, heartbreaking, and simultaneously unbearable documentaries of all time. You are literally transported into the world of these children, the ""aurolac kids.""

Through director/producer Edet Belzberg's intimate, shockingly raw, unadultered filming, which is a seemingly impossible feat in and of itself, the viewer is guided through the every day lives of these ""children."" These are not children we, as a generalized society, imagine encountering, let alone imagine passing by ""apathetically"" with no way to truly aid them on a daily basis. (I hesitate to use the term ""apathetically,"" as I am not from Bucharest, let alone a third-world country, and therefore in no way wish to judge those whose lives I have never lived, cannot fathom living.)

These are child adults; they speak in tongues normally reserved for those far superior in age, curse profusely, huff aurolac, a highly addictive and inevitably lethal industrial paint, steal, smoke cigarettes, fight with a hardened sense of brutality, and seem to grasp the reality of the hardship and unchangeability of their lives more gracefully than most adults do. Yet through all this, Belzberg is able to capture bits and pieces of the surviving innocence these children possess, humanizing them, revealing to the viewer that these are indeed still children, a notion that becomes progressively more blurred by the footage as the documentary unravels. Footage of a heavy crying spell of Ana, the questionably mentally ill 10-year-old runaway, a fleeting glimpse of the children playing and laughing with childlike innocence in the park, and a harrowing clip of Ana's 8-year-old brother, Marian, clinging on to Ana with a vehemence typically reserved for one's own mother while attempting to safely sleep in the dingy Bucharest subway that had become his home, meld together to maintain a sense these children's actual age.

Meanwhile, by capturing the dismal attempts of social workers to contact the parents, who, hardened by poverty and depression, simply cannot afford to provide for their children; or worse, have induced such fear into their children through alleged, but never acknowledged, severe beatings so as to cause boys like Mihai, a highly intelligent 11-year-old, to run away, Belzberg enables the viewer to see that these children are not simply left ignored by their own country, their own population. They are not products of mere domestic abuse, parental neglect, or mental illness; they are the results of a nation gone awry, a system collapsed.

And while perhaps Belzberg does not delve into the circumstances leading up to the footage captured, it's seemingly irrelevant to the film. At the time of the filming, this was the present, this was the raw, unexposed reality that was occurring at that moment. What led up to it, what circumstances brought these children together, what the entire picture was at that moment, second, year in Bucharest did not matter. Belzberg captured something unique, a reality that if not captured would have been forgotten, laid to rest complacently amongst the other past and present realities we, as generalized humans, could not, do not, would not have the opportunity to even conceive of. This is not a documentary produced for the sake of moralizing, creating order out of chaos, critiquing a country and political system, or anything of the sort. ""Children Underground,"" is an unpretentious, objective view into a haunting, nearly unbearably startling, reality we have never seen, let alone will soon forget.",1231718400,15,4646,5.205882352941177
1844252,4,B00008G8MC,"Ana, Mihai, Cristina, Macarena and others are a loosely aligned group of street kids who sleep on cardboard mats in the subway station. Some ran away from abusive parents while others grew up in orphanages. But they have come together in a sort of urban ""Lord Of The Flies"" scenario, where violence, paint sniffing and begging for handouts makes up the daily routine.

A few Romanian social workers and sympathetic foreigners try to help the kids get an education and find housing. But their well intentioned efforts are overwhelmed by a poor society scant on resources and mean spirited, selfish parents who seem to prefer their children living on the streets - one less mouth to feed after all.

Of course, street kids are a world wide issue, especially in Third World countries with underdeveloped social welfare systems. But the problem seems especially bad in Romania, where the anti-birth control policy of former dictator Ceaucescu has created a generation of unwanted chidren. I would have liked to see a little more attention given to how this idiotic policy caused such negative consequences. But the approach of director Edet Belzberg, to show the daily struggles of these kids in an up close and personal way, is certainly emotionally compelling.",1227312000,,1258,5.043269230769231

7983022,5,B00008G8MC,"This documentary hails from quite a few years ago now. I could not recall it, and it looked interesting so I purchased a copy.

I really could not fault the film or the filmmakers' choices in any respect. This is a highly awarded film, and rightly so, for several reasons, although I don't know whether a repeat viewing is possible as it is very sad, and some of the footage especially the violence inflicted on the children is literally gut-wrenching and devastating.

It is a great commendation of the film that it does not use artifice or musical backdrops to create a 'work of art'. The footage including interviews but also just watching the children interact on the street, including scenes of drug use and solvent sniffing, which obviously ain't pretty, doesn't shy away from the awfulness of their situation and therefore doesn't let the audience off the hook.

What is happening to the children in this film could equally apply to homeless underage children in any city around the world, including 'advanced' societies and very wealthy nations.

These children are 'not wanted', they are abandoned, they are let down by almost everyone, they are physically and psychologically abused, they are addicted to sniffing, they fear everything and everyone thus reacting with the only weapon left to them in the jungle - violence.

This is an outstanding film, obviously, in every respect. I highly recommend it. It is apart from anything else a very harsh slap in the face for those of us who think we care about our community while such tragedies continue to be perpetuated around us (out of sight, out of mind).

The bright spot in the film is that all is not lost and that the support structures that do exist in a very poor country do the best they can.

This film left me outraged that children can still so easily fall through the cracks, in any society, and end up on the streets to fend for themselves. That may sound very naive, but I think it is natural to feel very aggrieved when witnessing even a film about children in real pain and danger. Tough stuff.

A tough, unrelenting film that is as powerful still today as the day it was premiered.",1388707200,,2158,4.690476190476191
7983023,1,B00008G8MC,"SPOILERS! Did the filming of this movie actually help any of the children profiled in the film? It seems as if the film was made primarily for its sensational topic but in the end the children, on a whole, did not benefit from the movie. If they did end up in a better place a year later it had nothing to do with the director's help. I also found it outragious that a film crew would allow a ten year old girl to be severly beaten for the sake of the message of the film. The girl could have been permanently damaged or even killed but the camera kept rolling. At that point in the film I felt that achieving realism in the film was not worth having young children get hurt. It is now over ten years later and the director seems to have gone on to other topics. I was waiting at the end of the film for the producers of the film to suggest how the audience could help these children and there was nothing. I was disappointed that so little was done to help these children and the thousands of others that were not shown. Yes, the film enlightened the viewer to the problem in Romania but, unlike other similar films, did nothing to suggest to the audience what we could do. Some may say that enlightening the world to this problem was enough but I disagree. I gave the film one star for this reason only. It should be watched as any film that can enlighten the movie viewer to important topics they may not know about but I felt the director was more interested in winning awards than solving problems.",1360108800,5,1503,4.258741258741258
7983024,5,B00008G8MC,"Children Underground is painful to watch; but it is rather important. Director Edet Belzberg raises our awareness that there are too many impoverished children in Romania because dictator Nicolei Ceaucescu decreed that contraception would be illegal. That way, the working class would increase along with the rise of Communism in Romania. (Of course, this problem exists globally but the film focuses on the issue in Romania.) These young children can't always live in orphanages because of brutal conditions and parents can't always keep their children as the parents are too poor or the parents have routinely beaten their children--which all of the parents deny in this film. Children thus live feral lives in the subway stations of cities like Bucharest in Romania. While the first half or so of the film drags a bit and could have been more tightly edited, the second half of the film shows how social workers take a young child home so they can at least try to get his identity papers and give him a chance at a bright future. (Sadly, things don't always work out well despite the best efforts of nuns and social workers.) The cinematography is well done and the absence of a musical score helps in this case; there are few if any distractions from the ""slice of life"" we get about the everyday activities of these children. They beg, work a little for shopkeepers who have kiosks in the subway stations and they try to protect each other. Unfortunately, they get high quite often, too. As the film progresses, I began to care a great deal about the five children the film focuses on: Cristina; Mihai; Violeta ""Macarena;"" Ana and her brother Marian.

I don't want to give away too much more for fear of spoiling it for you; but there is one thing I must add because it really had a strong impact on me. While the filmmakers did a great job of documenting the everyday life of these unfortunate children who deserve so much more, I was infuriated that nobody stopped to help when one child, Ana, gets beaten up by other kids; she literally gets kicked in the head and no one from the film crew did anything about it. Apparently the people who are everyday passers-by don't care about these children very much, but I was appalled that the film crew simply let that happen. Indeed, there is more violence in this film; and it is only when one child starts cutting himself rather badly that we see any adult try to stop violent behavior. I admire this documentary; but I have mixed feelings about Edet Belzberg and the film crew.

The DVD comes with a few extras. I particularly liked the follow-up feature; we find out what happened to these children roughly eighteen months after the film was finished.

Children Underground is a tough film to take but it's extremely important that people all over the world know the terrible plight of these children all because some senseless, cruel dictator decreed that contraception was outlawed in Romania. I highly recommend this film for people who strive to improve the lives of children everywhere; and people studying this particular problem in Romania would do well to get this film on DVD. In addition, people who appreciate social and cultural documentaries that are rather cerebral will not be disappointed.",1358121600,2,3260,4.786856127886323

7983026,5,B00008G8MC,"Years ago in Romania, in an effort to increase the countries population, all forms of abortion and birth control were outlawed. This resulted in the births of tens of thousands of children that were unwanted by their parents. The number of abandoned children grew so fast, that shelters and orphanages overflowed and the children started living on the streets. Some kids decided to leave their families on their own, due to extremely harsh living conditions. Parents were sending their children out to beg on the streets, and the children decided they would rather keep the money for themselves that they spent their days begging for. Due to extreme hunger, they've turned to huffing paint from plastic bags, which takes away the hunger pains. Little kids gather in gangs for company, living together in the subways and hauling bottles for shopkeepers to try and earn money for food. This film shows just how many kids are along and abandoned, how many adults go on living their lives as though they don't even exist and when you meet their families (the ones that aren't orphans), you understand why they chose to live on the streets rather than at home. While a 10 year old smoking a cigarette might seem like he's tough and can handle the life, delving deeper, you find they are still just terrified and lonely children, who cry often and seem to shut down at the mention of going to live somewhere else. It's an amazing film, that goes back again a year after originally being filmed, to see what became of the children.

7983027,5,B00008G8MC,"This is hard on the eyes and mind, and will leave you feeling helpless about how such inhuman conditions can be met with indifference. But, when one thinks about it, we can all see how easy it is to fall into that cycle...of simply shrugging our shoulders and losing interest after being unable and incapable of coming up with a solution to this serious problem: Part of me wants to send money to help, but another part thinks these kids are too far gone and will essentially just spend it on paint. This is also reflected in the parents' attitudes towards their children. Incidentally, the parents who are interviewed are just as blind as their children. I know most of the lives being lived here have no basis for comparison and all seemed damaged beyond repair, so it is not difficult to see things through their eyes and understand why they carry on the way they do. Besides, the problem of course goes much deeper than simply bad parenting and institutions; the blame moves in many directions, not the least of which is Nicolae Ceauescu's.

We all know the world is filled with evil--indeed, evil is perhaps the de facto ruler of all mankind and always will be--but it is rare to see it up close for such a prolonged period of time. And this is just small taste of Ceauescu's legacy.

Yes, this documentary was hard to watch and there is little hope contained therein, but it is important not to look away. I'm appalled at the lack of resources for these kids, but the few caring souls working in the shelters should be commended for their persistence.

Amazing window and insight into a disturbing world, and it will leave you with a higher appreciation of your own, relatively perfect life.",1345939200,,1697,4.612582781456954
7983028,5,B00008G8MC,"The raw force of this movie will eat at you for days after watching it.  It is that disturbing.  Watching children as young as 8 living alone on the streets of Romania - existing by begging, and huffing paint to alleviate the torture of their lives- is the saddest thing I think I've ever witnessed on film.  I look at my children who were still coddled like the babies they were at age 8, 9 and 10 and I am amazed that these children can even survive in the conditions they are left in.  The worst tragedy is that without very serious intervention, the children will soon become adults living lives of cruelty and addiction on the same streets and probably having children of their own who will face a life of few possibilities other than following in their parents' footsteps.  It is not only in Romania that this is happening.  It's also happening right here in America - children growing up with little to no parental support or in homes where addiction and crime are the controlling factors.  The followup at the end of the film gives updates for the five children featured and none of them has entirely escaped their situation although two have moved into group homes for street kids and so are at least off the streets.  I'm not going to pretend to know the answer for what it would take to prevent such atrocities.  Perhaps just by watching films like this and becoming more aware, we can all do something, even something very small, to help and that will eventually make a difference.  At least, I hope that we can.  As for recommending this film, I do highly recommend it.  Is it disturbing and gut wrenching?  Yes but sometimes you have to face the ugly truth in order to know what needs to be changed.  I would not, however, recommend it for children under 12 and only with adult supervision for young teens.  This film shows drug use, smoking and cursing by very young children and also violence being done by them and to them.",1329696000,,1940,4.502857142857143
7983029,5,B00008G8MC,"Romanian cities teem with children living on the streets, since dictator Ceausescu -
hoping to increase the work force - outlawed both birth control and abortion.

More than any other film I have seen, this captures the heartbreak and hopelessness
of street kids and their lives. The 5 kids we follow scratch out an existence living
together in a subway station.

It is initially hard to comprehend, as some of these kids theoretically have homes
to return to.  But when we see the nightmare reality of those homes, we start to
understand that there are tiny children, some as young as 8, trapped between a
rock and a hard place.

A true horror film, but, like documentaries on the holocaust, one that has an
important reason to exist.  To move people to action, and to make sure this kind
of institutionalized neglect - a problem in many nations -  is brought to to an end
as soon as possible.",1326672000,,894,4.591194968553459
