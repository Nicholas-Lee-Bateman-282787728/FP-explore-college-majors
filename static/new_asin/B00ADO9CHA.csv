5409098,5,B00ADO9CHA,I really liked this DVD. It helped my back to feel better. She really went SLOW enough for the yoga to do some benefit.,1383004800,20,119,4.0
5409099,5,B00ADO9CHA,Gentle yet effective and satisfying workout. I highly recommed this dvd. Am in the process of buying a second one to give as as gift.,1382400000,4,133,4.36
5409100,5,B00ADO9CHA,Very gentle yoga for people with back problems who may not be able to get into intricate yoga poses. recommend,1379980800,36,110,4.55
5409101,3,B00ADO9CHA,Meets my expectations but nothing more Music could have been better. Wanted something to combine with other tapes I own and this does the trick,1376956800,4,143,4.76
5409102,5,B00ADO9CHA,I purchased this in order to continue yoga at home while classes are on hiatus at the local community college. Not too difficult even for a novice!,1376870400,4,147,4.481481481481482
5409103,5,B00ADO9CHA,"Benagh's routines don't just have basic poses that are good for your back, as just about all yoga poses are. In addition to a general back health routine, she has put together groups of postures that are each specific to a particular problem. The postures are gentle but effective over time. Benagh has a slower, Southern-style delivery that I find calming, and her cues are clear and well-timed. If back pain is a daily trial for you, this dvd may be worth a try.",1374796800,2,464,4.535714285714286
5409104,5,B00ADO9CHA,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see a more detailed version of my review on that site.

This DVD features veteran yoga instructor Barbara Benagh, who offers six yoga sequences specific to back care.  The Main Menu presents the following options:

How to Use this DVD
Interview with the Instructor
General Back Care (Revitalizing) (40 Min.)
Neck Care (40 Min.)
Lumbar Care (20 Min.)
Sciatica Relief (35 Min.)
Scoliosis Routine (25 Min.)
Rest and Restore (25 Min.)
Credits

Benagh uses a blanket in all the routines; there are a few poses that require a yoga block (a thick, sturdy book can be substituted), and two practices also use a folding chair.  I have described each sequence in greater detail below, providing more specific time information as well.

GENERAL BACK CARE (REVITALIZING) (40.5 minutes)

Benagh starts this routine seated for a seated twist and seated side stretch.  Coming to standing, she moves through shoulder shrugs, shoulder stretches, and standing forward bend, followed by a low lunge on either side.  She then uses the block between the hands for heart opening pose (a shoulder stretch).  Staying on the floor, Benagh flows from cat to cobra and then performs several locust variations.  Returning to standing in a wide-leg position, she moves through standing twist, forward bend, and bent over twist.  Benagh comes back to the floor for a leg stretch with slight crunch, bridge (feet narrow and wide), and reclining twist with arm variations.  She concludes with a short savasana.

NECK CARE (38.5 minutes)

Several of the moves in this practice are reminiscent of Benagh's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Stress-Relief/dp/B000ICLRKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Stress Relief</a>&nbsp;video.  She begins seated with shoulder shrugs, adding in a rib stretch.  Coming to lying with a blanket bolster under the neck and shoulders, she moves into arm across chest twist and arm under the waist.  Several more reclined stretches follow, including arms overhead with a block and arms in trident shape.  Returning to seated, Benagh performs a side body lift.  Next comes stretch of the East practiced with the hands both forward and back.  Additional postures include heart opening pose, dolphin to plank, locust variations, and bridge with a block under the sacrum.  A slightly longer savasana ends this practice.

LUMBAR CARE (22.5 minutes)

Here Benagh notes that a weak core and tight hips can contribute to low back difficulties, so this practice focuses on these areas.  She begins with a variation on reclined leg stretch, floating one leg and reaching with the arm.  Next is reclined bound angle, moving the knees in and out.  Benagh then performs core strengtheners, including small crunches, half boat, and twisting side crunch.  Moving through thunderbolt, table, and bird dog, Benagh comes down to a prone position for locust variations and sphinx pose.  She concludes with a 4-minute savasana, resting the calves on a chair.

SCIATICA RELIEF (33.5 minutes)

Benagh starts in constructive rest, performing sacral rocks with foot raises and sacral stabilization.  Next is reclined half lotus, an isometric knee press, and sacral rocks with a slight crunch.  This is followed by reclined leg stretch, wide leg bridge, and active child pose using a block.  Seated on a blanket, Benagh performs firelog pose, half-cow, and half Lord of the fishes variation.  She finishes with a 5-minute relaxation.

SCOLIOSIS ROUTINE (23 minutes)

This practice begins lying face-down, resting the hips on a blanket bolster.  Benagh then performs a side stretch on one side only in an attempt to stretch the shorter side.  Next, constructive rest with a shoulder stretch and then reclined twist, again on the short side only, then constructive rest with arms overhead.  The practice concludes with heart opening pose, three repetitions of bridge pose, and about 3.5 minutes relaxation, using weights on the tighter shoulder and opposite hip.

REST AND RESTORE (26.5 minutes)

For this more restorative routine, Benagh begins lying in constructive rest for wave breathing.  She again practices arm across chest, this time adding in a twist.  This is followed by a reclined twist and modified bridge pose.  The remaining restorative postures including lying using a bolster and block, legs up the wall (using a block and a chair), and savasana with a blanket under the thighs and a block under the head.

The gentle sequences on this DVD are appropriate both for those who are actively in pain and for those who wish to maintain optimal back health.  Prior yoga experience would be helpful, but it is not a necessity, as Benagh provides thorough, detailed instruction and offers modification suggestions throughout.",1367366400,140,4851,5.312746386333771
5409105,5,B00ADO9CHA,"Barbara is an excellent instructor and gives a lot of thought to her routines.  Her ""Yoga for Athletes"" DVD is still my favorite because it is put together a pose at a time and is really suitable for anyone... not just athletes.  This Back Care DVD is perfect for specific area focus and time limits... add it to your library!",1362787200,32,326,4.416666666666667
5409106,5,B00ADO9CHA,"I have enjoyed all of Barbara's yoga DVDs--her gentle demeanor and knowledge of yoga's benefits and correct form are a welcome addition to my yoga practice. This DVD is no exception. In addition to an interview with Barbara, there are six routines of varying lengths presented:

-General Revitalizing Back Care (40 Minutes)
-Neck Care (40 Minutes)
-Lumbar Care (20 Minutes)
-Sciatica Relief (35 Minutes)
-Scoliosis Routine (25 Minutes)
-Rest & Restore (25 Minutes)

The entire DVD was filmed in the vicinity of Glacier National Park, so while you are strengthening your back and learning more about the causes of back pain, you can enjoy the beautiful and relaxing mountain scenery. Highly recommended!",1361836800,46,702,5.258928571428571

5409128,3,B00ADO9CHA,"This dvd is good, but it is geared more towards people who have to be extremely careful due to back issues or for the elderly.  Having done yoga for more than 10 years I bought this because I do have psoriatic arthritis which affects my back.  That being said, this dvd is far too gentle for me.  It's more like a senior yoga class I accidentally took once.  If you have lots of different back issues like slipped discs, etc, or have just had surgery this might be good for you (if your doctor clears it).  But for someone who is experienced in yoga this is not ideal.",1475798400,,568,4.222222222222222
5409129,5,B00ADO9CHA,Great for beginners,1473897600,,19,5.666666666666667
5409130,2,B00ADO9CHA,"Really slow and long.  I like to take half hour to stretch/work out, each category in this is like an hour long",1466899200,,111,4.045454545454546

5409143,5,B00ADO9CHA,"Although the lady in the video wasn't following correctly i had so much neck pain released and talk about energy this video is the best,the moves were very smooth and simple to follow and im older and less flexible. I highly recommend this.",1462320000,,240,4.604651162790698
5409144,3,B00ADO9CHA,Good,1459814400,,4,4.0
5409145,4,B00ADO9CHA,"It started out being a little difficult for me to follow along with, as Benagh moves quickly. But, after watching/doing and having it become more familiar, it was great! It also helped that after viewing it the first couple of times, I finally had all the equipment needed by my mat. Benagh does not tell you beforehand all the things that you'll need. My back feels the best it has in many years, and I can attribute this to the exercises specific to the areas that bother me the most. Would recommend this DVD!",1454284800,3,512,4.457446808510638

5409148,5,B00ADO9CHA,"I have a degenerating disc in the lower back. Aches all the time, especially if I sit for long periods. The exercises for the sciatica nerve really do benefit if done every only for one week, 3 x's.  Easy to perform, nice stretches, good direction from the instructor.",1453075200,3,268,4.583333333333333
5409149,2,B00ADO9CHA,"I had high hopes when I purchased this DVD. I initially purchased it because it mentioned it would be helpful for people who have scoliosis. As someone with scoliosis, I have an S curve of my spine along with a straight neck, so I was interested to see if this would help me in any way. I quickly found that this DVD was not a fit for me. I thought it would be a routine that would provide stretches or it would be gentle enough for me to use. The exercises that were featured were more like body weight exercises and it actually caused me to experience more discomfort to say the least. I only used the DVD one time and that was enough for me. Perhaps this is a DVD that may be helpful for others or helpful for other back conditions, but for me, not a good fit.",1450915200,,763,4.093333333333334

5409162,5,B00ADO9CHA,This is a great dvd.  I purchased it for myself a few months ago and when my sister started having some back issues I sent her a copy as well.  I am a yoga instructor and use this dvd for myself as a way to take a great class rather than teach one.,1446595200,,248,3.660377358490566
5409163,1,B00ADO9CHA,"Wouldn't play, but by the time I had time to actually watch and use, it was months after the purchase. Could have just been I got a bad copy.",1445212800,2,141,3.896551724137931
5409164,2,B00ADO9CHA,Nice background and soothing music. Great for meditation. Video isn't really aimed at people with sciatica issues.,1443744000,,114,5.764705882352941
5409165,5,B00ADO9CHA,Private and personal yoga for me took time to get into but if you have back trouble and you need a start this is the way to go.  GO FOR IT!,1440720000,,139,3.4838709677419355

5409168,5,B00ADO9CHA,"Great and useful, I never realized how relaxing and strengthening yoga is, I have spinal stenosis, so there are days when my arm hurts terribly, I realize those are the days when I haven't done my yoga th night before, so something is working, and I am sleeping much better.",1435881600,2,274,4.5
5409169,1,B00ADO9CHA,"So much for believing good reviews.
Had a sciatica issue arise. Went to chiro and came home to look for a routine to help.
Found this, tried it and it is horrible for me. Doesn't do anything.
Okay, maybe the scoliosis routine? Nope. It too is horridly boring and doesn't do anything.
Gave DVD to a local library sale.",1433894400,2,317,4.389830508474576

5409193,3,B00ADO9CHA,Although the instructor gives wonderful explanations she uses too many props and moves along too quickly. I probably won't use this one much.,1428278400,5,141,5.173913043478261

5409198,2,B00ADO9CHA,"It has been some time since I bought this DVD. Unfortunately I was not able to finish the routines. I find the instructor's even toned emotionless voice very irritating. It makes me feel like a totality incompetent beginner. But, I am sure it is my fault, because the exercises are ok",1426982400,,284,4.588235294117647
5409199,5,B00ADO9CHA,Not a good video for getting in shape but will definitely help your back if you've been sitting all day.,1426723200,,104,4.25
5409200,5,B00ADO9CHA,"This is a wonderful video.  I have chronic, degenerating back issues and even my doctor and chiropractor love this video!  VERY gentle.  I have problems from my neck to my tailbone and none of these exercises hurt or undo the hard work my chiropractor does.  Even has a meditation sequence at the end of each session, and the scenery in National Glacier Park is GORGEOUS and resetful.",1426204800,5,384,4.686567164179104
5409201,5,B00ADO9CHA,"This is weird.. the front of the cover is very deceiving. This is the first time I bought an instructional dvd where the person did not look anything like the cover. the woman is a 50-60 year old blond woman.
However that aside I never felt more relaxed doing yoga and after yoga in the 3 years Ive been doing it. I tried 3-4 moves of every other circuit and while I feel it is not meant for people under 70 years old other than the actual yoga part it is very very soothing. It is great however if you are suffering from any joint injury and still want to do yoga. Absolutely no intense moves. no salutations which I love that she doesn't do. Very relaxing.",1425772800,2,658,4.188976377952756

5409214,5,B00ADO9CHA,"Love this DVD.  The routines are great for the back.  My back felt better after only 2 routines!  Although I can not do most poses, I have been practicing Yoga for many years now I still can not do most poses.  However, I can do these which are specially modified to accommodate those issues presented by people with back issues (1 leg shorter than the other, 1 hip higher than the other, inability to put back flat on ground, etc...)  These routines actually do cater to those individual issues.  You are instructed on what to do (and not to do) for the issues.

It is exactly as described and was timely delivered.  I would purchase another DVD from this instructor or this Seller.",1423785600,,683,4.495934959349594

5409217,5,B00ADO9CHA,Baby steps. So far it seem to be working but slow going. I didn't get this horrible back overnight and it's not going to be gone overnight. I find that each day things get a little easier and I can last a little longer. Recommended by my Dr. to hopefully prevent back surgery number four. If you have a back problem this is definitely worth a try.,1419206400,,347,4.1940298507462686

5409232,5,B00ADO9CHA,"This has been extremely helpful in easing back pain.  The selection of 6 workouts targets issues well, the lumbar workout alone has made this worthwhile. The general is good to do a couple of times a week to maintain progress.",1417824000,,226,4.65
5409233,1,B00ADO9CHA,This DVD is boring and too lax.  I'm not sure how the low back exercises would strengthen my back.  There are betters DVDs on the market for Low Back Pain.,1416960000,,155,4.133333333333334

5409239,5,B00ADO9CHA,Bought this primarily for my husband. He loves it. He has started off with the rest and restore section of the DVD and progressed to a few more difficult sections. It has helped him stretch and gain some flexibility. I have tried a few of these myself and having had two spinal surgeries I agree this DVD is very helpful without being overkill for someone with back issues. Glad I bought it.,1412294400,2,391,4.444444444444445

5409257,5,B00ADO9CHA,"This product does what it claims, to my experience: it helps someone with back spasms gently start strengthening and balancing their core, without stressing or further damaging the problem areas.  I used it in conjunction with a set of trigger point yoga DVDs and tools and was able to turn around a very frustrating situation that chiropractor, physical therapist, massage therapist, and muscle relaxants weren't up to.  These guys know what they're doing, with lots of experience refining their techniques, before making the DVDs, and the proof was in my own experience.  While I won't keep using them now that I'm doing better (and am loving The Ultimate Yogi series), I'll definitely keep these in reserve for when/if I should need them again.",1408060800,3,747,5.056910569105691

The poses are simple and well-explained, the instructor is calm, and the sequence is very relaxing. As a person with scoliosis who has hardware in my back and chronic neck and shoulder pain, I found this video to be extremely helpful. Not once did I feel as if I needed to push myself in a way that could harm me. Great DVD!",1405641600,4,494,4.2105263157894735

5409278,4,B00ADO9CHA,"I really like the stretching.  I was in an auto accident a few years ago which caused some problems in my neck and shoulders.  The neck section was very helpful.  Unfortunately there is a problem with the disc when I try to go to the lumbar exercises from the main menu.  It gives me an error message and I can't play that section only.  It isn't scratched, it just doesn't play.  Still worth it for what I needed it for though.",1401926400,,428,4.222222222222222

5409280,3,B00ADO9CHA,"This was a lot of stretch and not much yoga.  Interestingly, although it is called Yoga for Back Care, the instructor did things that really aren't very good for your back, like coming to a seated position straight from laying down.  I think everyone knows that you are supposed to roll to your side and push yourself up to save strain on your back.",1400716800,,349,4.4375
5409281,5,B00ADO9CHA,"I am a recently retired RN. I was a bedside nurse, in a stepdown cardio unit of a level one trauma hospital. I began to have sciatica trouble about a year and a half ago. I have been to therapy twice but was still  having a lot of pain. Was not able to climb steps except like a toddler with one step at a time. I have been using this CD faithfully and now can once again, most days, climb steps like an adult instead of a child. My goal is to be able to once again hike and I truly think I will make it.
instructions are clear and slow. Great emphasis is placed on breathing and to take each pose slowly. I have bought 2 supposedly beginner yoga CD's which might be for beginners but not ""older"" beginners.  Would not hesitate one second to recommend to anyone that is a beginner.",1400544000,2,781,4.098039215686274

5409293,5,B00ADO9CHA,"I also find that after I have done a routine from Yoga for Back Care, I like to do ""real"" yoga for a few minutes. Nonetheless, this is a great collection of stretches for the back and neck.  Body Wisdom Media, the producers of Back Care, do have lots of excellent ""real"" yoga dvds as well, each with multiple routines that give an outstanding traditional stretch. So I might do one routine from Back Care plus a little regular yoga from one of the other DVDs, and 45 minutes later I'm a new person.

Instructor Barbara Benaugh knows how to de-stress the body.  I highly recommend her Yoga for Stress Relief. Again, not really ""yoga"", but a very effective combination of stretches and poses that relieve tension headaches, digestive troubles and other common symptoms of stress.",1399334400,,777,4.698529411764706

5409300,5,B00ADO9CHA,"After a lifetime of sleeping well, the last 10 months or so have been really difficult for me.  Every night over this time, my back would begin hurting shortly after laying down and get progressively worse.  My sleep would become more fitful as the night wore on, changing positions in the attempt to get comfortable, until, after 6 or so hours of sleep, I would have to get up because I couldn't take the pain any more and could find no position that was tolerable.  After visiting doctors and going for physical therapy (which, to their credit, moved the pain from the mid-to-upper to lower back!), I was starting to feel hopeless and think that this was what life was going to be like for me - at 42, a daunting prospect.  Never having done yoga, I decided to take a friend's advice and got this dvd just to see, and to give it a try.  After 3 days of doing the 20-minute lumbar routine nightly, I awoke free of back-pain for the first time in 10 months.  The next day, again no pain.  I just finished the routine today (5th day of doing it) and wanted to post a review as I really can't overstate the change this has made in my life.  Of course it's just been less than a week, and should things change, I'll certainly update the review, but I'm sold.  I'm pretty much planning on having a daily yoga practice for the rest of my life - it's worth it!

With regard to the content, the yoga is easy to follow, gentle enough for beginners (although there are a few poses that will challenge those who haven't done abdominal workouts in a good while), and I found Barbara Benagh's instruction to be excellent.  It's free of metaphysical yadda yadda, and instead includes very specific instruction on how to move specific parts/regions of the body to achieve the right position in the poses and avoid problems, and to relax various areas in which tension has been held.  There is a nice blend of relaxation, stretching, and strength-building.  Highly recommended.",1394668800,23,1962,4.524079320113314
5409301,5,B00ADO9CHA,"I have enjoyed this DVD a lot. I was looking for a yoga video without a lot of spirituality. Really just wanted the benefit of the exercise. The instructor makes it easy to understand each movement and how to do it well.  There are 6 different workouts, I do them all for variety and depending on how much time I have any given day. I highly recommend this DVD. The instructor also makes it clear where you should be feeling any given stretch so it's easy to know if you are overdoing it.",1392768000,5,488,4.247311827956989
