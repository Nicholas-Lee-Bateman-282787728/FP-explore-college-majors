By Rob Jones

Keith Richards is one sonic star who does not need an introduction! The Rolling Stones guru is one of the most recognisable and renowned characters to have ever surfaced! His story is a turbulent tale but along the way there is a tune testimony
that helps place him as one of the greatest rock n rollers that will ever exist!
Keith Richards: The long way Home is a 2 DVD set that explores the life and times of the stylish Stone; and, it is a neatly packaged product.
DVD 1 collates a series of interviews with aural associates and band biographers who clearly place Keef in the highest of esteem. To add to these references we are informed of the influences that helped shape this English eccentric-plus, there is also the archive and rare footage of the great man in action. There are no short measures in this extensive assessment. Keith comes under scrutiny whether it is as a member of the Stones, other projects or as a solo artist-and, there are also insights in to his personal life which is always a cause for intrigue!
DVD 2 assembles a series of random chats with Richards across the decades and over a series of states!?! The one thing that becomes clear is through all of the excesses that Keith appears to be a genuine and honest cat! He does not hide from the truth and admits that if others (i.e. Mick Jagger) want to tell their side of the story they are quite welcome to espouse their feelings. Keith opens up to a series of probing questions and does not shy away-and, as he says you cant accuse me of anything I haven't already confessed to.
This release is a must for fans of Keith, The Stones, music, celebrity and the human condition! Mr. Richards has not taken any shortcuts on The Long way Home!",1444003200,,1750,4.465625

8646484,3,B00IYLX202,"I first bought ""Keith Richards Under Review"" a few years back and was very happy with it. Then I ordered ""Keith Richards the Human Riff"" about a year ago, and to my surprise, it was the same as ""Keith Richards Under Review."" Different cover, same DVD, Bummer. Now I was ordering the ""Keith Richards The Long way home"" And I'm  very leery because I already owned 2 Under Reviews but wait I say! There are 2 DVDs here, surely  this one has got to be different!  Wrong.  The 1st disc was the same as ""Keith Richards Under Review"" and the #2 disc was Keith being interviewed by various people, most of it I already saw on U-Tube at one time or another. So, if you don't have any of the first DVD's this one is not bad. And I guess I'll be alright with my 3 disc's because I have friends that borrow and never bring back. I gave it 3 stars because it is put together well and informative if you didn't already have the 2 other copies.",1403049600,14,929,4.173184357541899
8646485,3,B00IYLX202,"I purchased video this thinking I finally might get some video footage of Keith, especially some footage from the 70's, however it's not the case with this film, pretty much rehashed and edited video from the ""Rolling Stones"" under reveiw series that you can see for free on You-Tube. Even the interveiws are nothing new, I should have known better. however since it just came out there were no reviews to go by so I took a chance.  I am pretty much convinced that there isn't anything out there that we haven't already seen, which is to bad because whats out there has very little Keith in it, I gave the video three stars just because, In my opinion you would be better off purchasing ""Rolling Stones Live at the Checkerboard lounge"" featuring quite a few Chicago bluesmen including Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Lefty Dizz, etc. It has some of the best footage of Keith I have ever seen it's circa 1980-81 and was filmed in a small Chicago Blues club, other than that I would also recommend  the book ""Stones Gear""  probably the best thing ever written about the Rolling Stones and believe me when I say I have read just about everything there is to read on the Stones",1402876800,8,1166,4.516587677725118
