Get it get it get it! And memorize it!

4985133,3,B006FLE5P4,"I bought these DVDs in preparation for our first child, and overall, the info IS helpful. However, it's very hard to get past the video quality. It was shot in the early 90s I believe. I feel like this info should be re-shot for today's mom's and dads, even in the info is completely the same. The 80's/90's clothing (tight neon spandex with socks) is a little distracting... my husband couldn't take it seriously.

Overall, I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is... but I'm finding there are very few ""natural"" childbirth tutorial dvds out there, so there wasn't much choice. If you can get past the visuals, it can definitely be helpful, but I wouldn't purchase alone. I would definitely do l&d classes with a doula/midwife in addition.",1344816000,5,744,4.679389312977099
4985134,4,B006FLE5P4,Bought for instruction for Doua course. Great DVD. Great for use for preparing for your own birth experience or for teaching others for birth preparation.,1344470400,,154,5.2
4985135,2,B006FLE5P4,"This ""kit"" doesn't come with the booklet that the DVD is constantly referring to.
The video is boring and hard to watch. I am pregnant with my first child and I think I have learned more from reading ""what to expect when you are expecting"" than using this kit.
Waste of $$$$$!",1339027200,3,276,4.326923076923077
4985136,4,B006FLE5P4,After seeing parenting skills and confusing I think this is a must have for any new parent and even for those on their 2nd and 3rd as you can never be prepared enough and you can always do better. Our children are so important so this is really a must have.,1337731200,,257,4.0588235294117645
4985137,5,B006FLE5P4,"I just found this product on Amazon.  I purchased it directly from their website.  I bought the product for a friend's baby shower.  The gift was well received I was happy to say. First of all it is a great product that helps pregnant couples learn skills needed for childbirth preparation, but it is one of those unique baby shower gift ideas that no one else would have thought of.",1337731200,,383,4.442857142857143
4985138,5,B006FLE5P4,"I purchased a digital pink kit download from their website couple weeks before my due date.  So I had to learn all the skills very quickly.  It has very good info you won't find anywhere else. I have to say that at first it was very confusing for me, but if you don't understand something, you can always contact them.

I would recommend buying this as soon as possible before due date so that you can learn all of the skills and learn about your body and pelvis.

You can learn how to relax in your pelvis, to make the contractions more productive and to achieve a quicker labor.

I think it's a must for everyone, especially for those attempting to have a natural birth.  It helped me manage my labor.

Your birth experience will be positive no matter the outcome, if you apply the skills.",1337212800,8,791,4.376712328767123
4985139,5,B006FLE5P4,"I've been involved in the revision and upgrading of the Pink Kit's resources for a year and a half. Having never been pregnant before, I haven't used the Pink Kit myself, but I would definitely choose this method if I were to have a child, because it is VERY hands-on, exactly like birth is. It also puts a lot of effort into involving the father of the child or, if he's not present, whoever a pregnant woman chooses to have at her side for support and help. That's the kind of birthing method I would want!",1330128000,,508,4.302083333333333
4985140,5,B006FLE5P4,"I am a doula in N.California and I have been encouraging my clients to use this skills resource for almost two years now.  The outcomes are phenomenal, compared to before people were learning some skills.  There are other skills-based methods out there, but none as complete and useful as the Pink Kit, in my experience. The DVD gives a great overview of the material, including how to map your own pelvis, which is great information to have for 3-D visualizations of the baby's descent, and knowing when baby needs help and what specific kinds of help will be effective. The pdf books are also very useful, especially the information about breathing through contractions and working together, as a couple, to help the baby be born. Most helpful is the audio CD on the ""Internal Work"" which helps a woman realize where she is tight inside the birth canal and how she can practice with directed breathing and her partner's very gentle massage ahead of time to soften and expand, so that the pushing phase of labor can be quicker.

Some people feel a bit overwhelmed by all the information, but think of the preparation you would do to run a marathon, or drive a race-car.  Labor is a huge endeavor, and having a few skills in your back pocket in case of need feels good going into it. I have found that even when couples do only a little practice, it seems to make a difference. Learning skills means taking responsibility for your own body and your own baby and your own birth, and for most of us, that is a good thing, resulting in a feeling of empowerment and lasting joy. No one can predict what will happen in any one birth, but being prepared for various possibilities is a smart way to go.",1330041600,13,1695,4.547540983606558

8497063,5,B006FLE5P4,This method helped me achieve a non medicated Vbac birth. I recommend it to anyone having a baby. My husband and I misplaced the last one we purchased so we are going to buy it again because I am 26 weeks pregnant with our third baby. I want to read and do the exercises again. I am part of the babycenter. Com board and I recommend this to everyone.,1437350400,,350,4.086956521739131
8497064,2,B006FLE5P4,"First of all, this kit is very poorly laid out. There is a long booklet to read, a DVD to watch, and two audio CDs. Each item assumes that you haven't familiarized yourself with the others, so they repeat themselves quite a bit.

That is my second complaint about this kit -- the redundancy. It seems like every time they they start a new section, they start by telling you how good the Pink Kit is and how much you need their skills. There is so much fluff! On the booklet at least I can skim over the parts that they've already told me about 100 times, but in the CDs you have to wait for them to finish their speech.

I do think that the content of this kit is decent. There is some wisdom in what they have to offer, which is why I continued with the whole thing. But I'm not convinced it's any better than taking a local class that instructs on a child birthing method, such as Bradley.

Their language seems to be a bit shaming at times, almost implying that it's your fault if you don't cope with labor well, that you should have just prepared better and practiced more.

Unfortunately the instructions that they give on how to implement some of these skills are lacking. They try to tell you how to manipulate certain parts of the body and certain positions to use, but the instructions here are ironically brief, considering how lengthy they are in describing the importance of using their skills.

In summary, while I do think it's important to prepare for birth, I would not recommend this as the tool to do it.",1433289600,2,1522,4.363957597173145
8497065,5,B006FLE5P4,I think the skills laid out in this are crucial to know for a good birth experience! I used it with my first and was amazed at how smoothly labor and delivery went. My midwives also seemed very impressed/surprised that a first time mom could have such a fast and easy birth. I recommend it to everyone and even though some of the other reviewers are correct about the quality of the video and the literal tons of reading material it is definitely worth it! I would recommend getting it early on in pregnancy so you can take the time to read everything.,1425340800,,552,4.368932038834951
8497066,1,B006FLE5P4,"Very expensive, these materials can be found on the web. Nothing new under the sun hear. Very outdated video, old taping. The people are from a different generation. So the videos haven't been updated in years.",1415318400,4,210,4.861111111111111
8497067,1,B006FLE5P4,"Mother of God....this has to be the most painfully written assembly of information I've ever encountered. It physically hurt my brain to slog through the hundreds of pages of extraneous verbage contained within the pink kit. And the crazy extra length made it super stressful for us to fit into our schedules.

Honestly, the author is more interested in telling you how important the pink kit is than in telling you what you need to know. Easily 1/3 of the words here are dedicated to describing in imprecise language how important the pink kit is. Its almost like they are trying to brainwash you.

Common Knowledge Trust: Its relatively easy to write a 600 page book on birthing better, its far harder (BUT far more valuable) to get that information down into a digestible length. Thats what I should be paying you for, competent delivery of information...alas you're no good at it. You've made plenty of money on this since 1991, pay someone who knows the material to re-write it. Please do your future customers this favor.

Clear and concise writing would make this a no-brainer to buy, but I can only recommend that you find someone who has done it and pay them double to give you the cliff's notes presentation over a couple of hours. I would give that 10 stars.",1390435200,11,1269,4.681614349775785
8497068,2,B006FLE5P4,"This set has amazing info and I wish I could get to that info quicker than having to go through all the tediousness of the presentation of it.  First of all it has no book, I guess they are cutting costs and give you the book in the format of about a million (I exaggerate but there's a LOT) pdf files.  PDF files that are grouped by topic but not in any order to correlate with the DVD.  I hate reading stuff on the computer so have decided if I want to get my money's worth out of this I have no option but to print them all out and create the book myself.  From what I've read so far the book refers to the DVD and the DVD to the book but it's hard to navigate them to coordinate the information.
I just want this to be easy and it isn't - it's complicated.

I wish they would just do a book and a DVD, ditch the two CD's and add that to the DVD's and make it VERY USER FRIENDLY.  Have it all in the same order so it's easy to follow along with the book and the DVD... perhaps once I have it printed it will make more sense?  I started listening to the CDs and was so bored as the voices took ages to get to the point, I don't think I ever got to the point as I got so bored listening that I turned it off.  A transcript of that would help too so you can skim through to get to what you want to know maybe?  I don't want to sit and listen to something for 43 minutes to find it's something I already knew and get nothing out of it for example - I don't have time for that.  A transcript would be fantastic or better summary of what it is about.  Maybe there is info on these things in the many pdfs I haven't yet had a chance to read?

If you have a lot of time on your hands and have the patience for things presented tediously then you'll probably make it through.  I'm disappointed with this right now as it cost us a lot of money and has just caused frustration more than anything.  I know there is good info in there but you really have to work for it to make head or tail.  It's like they dump it all in your lap and tell you to organize it yourself and put it altogether. Wish I had time!  I bought this as I thought they did that for me!

If I could return this I would.",1368576000,5,2181,3.8325892857142856
8497069,1,B006FLE5P4,"It was really outdated, and I didn't have the patience to watch all of it. Especially when I also bought Laugh and learn about childbirth, and watched that one first.",1366848000,6,166,4.566666666666666
8497070,4,B006FLE5P4,"PROS:
-VERY helpful internal exercises to help prepare the vagina for delivery.
-good breathing exercises to practice, so you can focus better when the pain is coming on full force.

I ordered the pink kit off of the actual pink kit website, not from amazon.  I should have ordered from amazon because I never received my package!  It must have gotten lost somewhere on its journey from NEW ZEALAND to new jersey, but they do have great customer service so I was able to get the electronic version of the pink kit instead, and was reimbursed the difference.  It ended up working out just fine. I just wish I had received it sooner. I had already ordered it kind of late in my pregnancy, so I wasn't able to use and/or read through everything, but I plan to use it earlier with my next, and I still feel it was worth it.  This is the reason I didn't give a 5 star review.

The pink kit has some internal exercises to do by yourself or with your partner. I can't imagine how anyone could do these particular exercises on themselves during their 8-9 months of pregnancy.  With a big belly in the way, it is hard to reach....errr....certain places, which is when the hubby comes in handy.  The only thing I have to warn is that this is not for a woman who does not FULLY trust her partner.  Partners have to be gentle and able to follow instructions because I found that even when my husband WAS following the directions for these internal exercises it was... uncomfortable and borderline painful. BUT don't let this scare you away.  Any pain you may feel while doing these exercises will feel like a TICKLE when compared to the pain of actual labor. I truly believe that because I did these internal exercises, I was able to give birth to my son without needing an episiotomy, and had very few stitches from a slight tear.  Also, the actual pushing part only lasted about half an hour.  In other words, he slipped right out...jk

Anyway, I feel it is worth buying, especially if you are early on in your pregnancy because you'll have more time to look through all the information.  But there is really nothing to lose if you buy it late in your pregnancy, as I did, because any techniques, skills you do learn will be used and extremely helpful.

Good luck to all!",1364256000,3,2261,4.453883495145631
8497071,3,B006FLE5P4,"I loved how this kit improved my understanding of the anatomy of the birthing process, but watching the DVD and reading the pdfs felt like such a chore. It's boring, repetitive, and of poor visual quality. I think it would be fantastic for someone with a long attention span and a lot of of patience.",1357948800,3,300,4.472727272727273
