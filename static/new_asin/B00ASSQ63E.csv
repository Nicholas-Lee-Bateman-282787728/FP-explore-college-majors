To know and to see that he refused to give because of obstacles, hindrances, and/or challenges was very encouraging because his dad was against his athletic career change. But, he pressed forward and persevered and proved his dad wrong. See it for yourself! In Jesus Name, God Bless...",1463011200,,311,4.886792452830188

5508117,5,B00ASSQ63E,"What a cool story. This is a sweet and uplifting illustration of the power of God to redeem brokenness and ordain adventure beyond what we could imagine for ourselves.

I was drawn to this movie for the soccer element and the likability of the characters, but was pleasantly surprised by how funny and romantic it was. I can relate to Kurt's ambition and drive, as well as his frustration that all the hard work doesn't always pay off the way it should.

Some viewers may be cautioned that there is some use of alcohol - much of the story takes place on a college campus, after all. And Kurt's mother descends into some pretty intense alcoholism. It certainly isn't extreme by movie standards, but for younger kids it could be too much. I mention it since For The Glory's lack of MPAA rating and Christian theme might lead families to wonder if it's suitable. I think it definitely is, but it depends on your kids and their sensitivities.

I recommend For The Glory. It's a fun watch and you might actually find it speaks to your own life.",1375401600,4,1039,4.51595744680851

8557418,5,B00ASSQ63E,"This movie was awesome, not only because I know Kurt personally (although that made it much more powerful) but because its true and inspirational. I think what I love best is that its genuine and real and draws ones attention to GODs glory rather than to the man. After all, as much as I respect and love Kurt and all the real life characters represented in the movie, the real beauty and power lies in Gods providential orchestration of events and compelling Spirit laced throughout the film. Well done, Chris Rodgers and all at CDR, for producing a poignant and fun movie that inspires the viewers to pursue all Life has to offer but to do so with confidence, knowing that the Sovereign Lord of all creation has our best in mind and rewards those who seek Him. :)",1512604800,,765,4.510791366906475

8557420,5,B00ASSQ63E,"Great movie based on true story. I really enjoyed this movie. The true-life story of professional soccer player, Kurt Kuykendall and how he walked on and got the starting role for NCAA division 1 soccer. This is just unheard of. Jason  Burkey of October Baby does a great job playing Kurt. A wonderful story of hope and courage and rising above in a very difficult circumstances.",1509667200,,379,4.742424242424242
