Great costumes...even the ending is great, wished that it had more of the final physical embrace between the two characters.  Worth seeing it again...",1513900800,,315,5.387755102040816
8200252,5,B000RF1QLA,"Shu Qi and Wallace Huo.  Physically, they are a match in heaven.  The naturally beautiful and sensuous Shi Qi and one of the most handsome man I have ever watched in Chinese drama.  They both look smashing in ancient costumes.
The story centers around Shi Qi (Chu Chen) and the five men in her lives.  She was a cold assassin because she was brought up to kill and made use of by a powerful man of the court.  She also felt betrayed by her first love, the man who taught her all the killer skills.  She started to open up when she met Li Jing who is idealistic, kind, passionate and clever.  Li Jing is quite everything she is not.  It was interesting when the Emperor asked her why she chose the weakest men of the five men in terms of worldly experience and fighting skills particularly over Li Shi Min a upcoming ruler.  She answered, 'Li Jing is a fllickering light which needs protection to make him shine brightly' whereas Li Shi Min is already a guiding light.  She found in Li Jing what she is not.  All the characters were well written.  Their motivations, their strengths and weaknesses although the main character and focus is Chu Chen/Shu Qi.  I love the opening theme song and love the costumes.  Definitely worth watching.  As one reviewer one, one advantage is that it is not melodramatic where revenge and death rules the day.  There was a scene where I even sympathised with the evil Yang Su.",1415750400,2,1409,4.466666666666667

8200254,5,B000RF1QLA,"I was entranced with this beautiful Chinese tale of beauty, assassins, history and psychological entanglements.  Usually, when something begins extraordinarily it ends with a whimper.  Not so with the Romance of the Red Dust.  The only thing that disappoints is the nondescript title.  I will only describe the first and the last scene without giving the plot away.  The beginning scene is gorgeous and very well choreographed not only in the dancing but in the killing.  I believe that is that contrast between beauty and death that powerfully develops the scene. It is a thing of beauty to see these lovely maidens dance with their long scarves each in a color of the rainbow.  The main dancer and protagonist is in red because red holds deep significance of beauty and love in Chinese culture and so it proves with the assassin Hung Bi who will become the lover of 5 men in her life.  When the dance ends the girls kill the entire court and burn the palace down.  Then they walk away as gracefully as they danced with the flames of the building in the background.  It is a powerful, majestic and beautiful scene that sets the tone for the entire series.  During the many entanglements both personal and national, one keeps wishing that it would never end although you would like Hung Bi to find the love and peace she deserves.  Hung Bi is played by an actress that is the Angelina Jolie of Chinese film.  Someone else posted that she was a playmate.  I didn't know that but she is certainly an extremely beautiful woman with the exotic looks that make her unique and not just commonly pretty.  She has a regal and commanding presence.  Her 3rd man turns out to be her true love and he was my favorite of all five.  It is in the last scene that he truly earns my heart when he is looking at the many bells that Hung Bi has hung in the tree for his return.  He turns around to see her there and his reaction is such a truthful and credible one that I would have given him an Oscar for that scene.  There are some overly melodramatic moments in the series that were over the top, but hey, it is a Chinese soap opera and their customs are different from ours.  Maybe it wasn't that corny for them but I tell you that I am buying this series from Amazon because I will plan to watch it again and again.  Beautiful in nature and superb acting by the main characters.  What else can you ask for?  I highly recommend it and just wish there was more to watch.",1329177600,9,2454,4.392461197339246
8200255,5,B000RF1QLA,Shu Qi played a good role as an assassin whom I personally feel is not beautiful but is attractive in a seductive way. She is Taiwan's playboy's playmate and pics to show for it. The actors played their individual roles very well along with beautiful background scenery and action of which I had hoped there could have been more. The English sub titles went very well with their spoken Cantonese language.,1321488000,5,405,4.71830985915493
8200256,5,B000RF1QLA,"Shu Qi is such a good actress in this drama, and so is the entire cast.  It's funny and enthralling at the same time.  I luv it <3",1253232000,,130,3.607142857142857
8200257,5,B000RF1QLA,"This series is fantastic.  It really builds up the characters.  Even the bad guys are not totally portrayed in black and white along with the ""good"" guys.  It has a lot of depth, action, drama, suspense.  Each epsisode I am just hooked and can't wait to watch the next.  Great fight scenes, plots, intriqued and romance.
