8662155,1,B00KW85MPS,"This is absolutely mystifying.  Sold separately as DVD 1 and DVD 2, the second disc is IDENTICAL to the first, except for the jewel case art and the printing on the DVD itself.  If you buy DVD 2, you are buying DVD 1.  Who would do this?  Who thinks this is a good idea?  Who's in charge here?  The contents of BOTH editions are exactly the same.  Plus, there are additional, better lessons from the same author, for FREE, on youtube.
This is worse than a mistake, it's some kind of hoax.  Save yourself the headache of trying to figure out what's going on here, avoid BOTH DVDs.",1470268800,,579,4.296296296296297

8662157,5,B00KW85MPS,"If you thought DVD 1 was good (and it is) then you certainly won't be disappointed with DVD 2. If you are serious about wanting to play, good, competent lap steel enough to turn heads, then check this out. Techniques such as slants, bends and riffs - covering equipment to complement you're playing, it's all in the DVD and more. If you really want to blow your mind  then check out the Blues/Rock section it takes you to another level, one I personally didn't think was possible to achieve on a lap, and yet through all of this at no time do you lose the plot. Careful explanations along with TAB and musical notation are shown on-screen so you know just where you are. Buy the DVD and start booking the gigs.",1427155200,5,710,4.378787878787879
8662158,5,B00KW85MPS,"Folks, if you want to play, go with Joe Doc all the way!  Hey, that rhymes!  My wife, Laura, and I were so impressed with the first DVD we just had to have more.  Joe understands that not all of us have had music lessons all our life, and that some of us need clear, concise, and direct instruction.  Joe is an educator, and he teaches like one in these videos.  Want to learn well, and without feeling like a dolt?  Joe can help you, no matter what your level is my opinion.  Thanks for letting my share it!",1426723200,4,508,4.070707070707071
8662159,5,B00KW85MPS,"Second DVD in the set - continues where the first left off, with a bit of overlap so it stands on it's own. More complex pieces, great licks and lessons. Thanks.",1408579200,4,161,4.225806451612903
