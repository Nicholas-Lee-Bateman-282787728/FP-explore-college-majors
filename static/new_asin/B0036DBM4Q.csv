7504560,1,B0036DBM4Q,"What I'm rating here is the lead in to the movie because the producers do not allow me to skip over the filthy, subjective comments in this gross attempt at advertising.  I purchased the movie because I wanted the movie.  Since I paid for the DVD I should be allowed to go directly to the movie without watching any advertising.  The first coming attractions were of SPRING 1941 and includes a man and a woman in the middle of hot, steamy sex.  The next coming attraction is of STUNTMEN and what is pictured is a dirty old man being asked why he got into stuntwork and his answer is ""Pussy"".  A little later a woman holding an nterview offers her opinion of real supreme as having a ""Rhinoceros cock.""  I was throughly discusted not only with these previews but the fact that I was not allowed to avoid them and go directly to the movie.  I do not feel the producer of this DVD has any right to force customers to watch these coming attractions prior to watching what was ordered.  .",1354924800,5,983,4.362637362637362
7504561,5,B0036DBM4Q,"Found this movie on Netflix and loved it so much I had to buy it.  Have lent it to friends and they bought it.  It's definitely my kind of movie.  If you live by Murphy's Law (What ever can go wrong, will go wrong) you'll appreciate it.",1338854400,,236,3.978723404255319
7504562,5,B0036DBM4Q,"This is movies for anyone who likes complex crime stories, an escaped convict who get in a middle of story where the wife tries to kill a black mailer and then her cheating husband, who is sleeping with her sister. The story gets lots of twists and turns and laughs. They must cooperate or both go to jail, with hilarious complications. This is definitely worth own and watching you will love it.",1306627200,,396,4.513888888888889
7504563,5,B0036DBM4Q,"I wrote this film with Jim Kouf, who also directed it. Jim has written some very big features and I mostly write for Network TV. A couple of years ago, Jim got wind of some guys who wanted to put a few dollars into an independent film. So Jim and I sat down and decided to write a ""studio"" type film that we could do on a low-budget. We wanted to make a little black comedy, with the emphasis on comedy and also something that almost the whole family could see. We had a blast writing it and it was the first time in both of our careers that we wrote exactly what we wanted without a studio or a network looking over our shoulders and telling us what we could or couldn't do. We decided to shoot it in Montana because it's pretty easy to crew-up there with excellent people. Not only that but every time you turn the camera around, you've got a shot that makes your movie look like it cost a lot more than it did. We tested the movie in both L.A. and in Montana and our test audiences all laughed in the places we thought we're funny. Plus we got over eighty percent ""recommends"", which usually denotes a hit. However, for some reason we never did get a theatrical release. But, as you can see, it's now on DVD. It's got a terrific cast, a mixture of seasoned comic vets and some very funny new faces. We made this film so people could kick back and have a few laughs and forget about their day. We hope that's you.",1275523200,7,1415,4.149090909090909

8738913,5,B0036DBM4Q,"Will Carson (Josh Cooke) has been wrongly accused of a crime. He seizes his chance to escape when the cop car he's riding in spits him out at a fork in the road. He hides and in the dark he hears a gunshot and see a woman dragging a body out to a car, putting the body in the trunk and driving off. He breaks in the house for some food and a change of clothes, but she returns because she can't get rid of the body with all the police out looking for the escaped convict. She returns home to find the escapee. After a battle Will really puts his freedom at risk when he agrees to help the lady pretty killer (Jaime King) he barely knows get rid of a dead body, or is it? In this movie if it can go wrong, It does and it gets pretty interesting with all the characters caught up in a mix of crimes and crazy situations. All this guy wants to do is get away and at every turn her gets himself in one mess after another. I found it very funny and reminds me a little of the early Cohen brothers movies.",1444953600,,999,3.9261083743842367

8738915,4,B0036DBM4Q,"saw the pre-view, thought it would be more of a comedy than it turned out to be. I really did enjoy the movie however. in a couple of places it had a ah come - on. part, other than that it was quite enjoyable.",1430611200,,209,3.772727272727273

8738917,3,B0036DBM4Q,"I found this line from the film interesting:  ""Sometimes it seems that the only choices you make are the choices you've already made.""  I think this relatively simple but insightful quote offers a mini flashlight into the unconscious.

The title of the movie is a play on words.  One day a child in a moving car was playing with  a fork when it fell out of the window and onto the road.  Shortly afterwards the fork caused an accident to another vehicle, which dramatically changed one man's life.  The fork also refers to the idea that we sometimes live our lives on auto-pilot (ie: following an unconscious script, pattern repetition, etc) until something causes us to question how we've been living.

If you liked the TV series, Hart of Dixie, you might enjoy this film as it stars the actress and actor behind two of its characters, Lemon and Joel. They form a comedy duo and run from the law in rural Montana.  I don't think the chemistry between the two was quite there and perhaps the film tried to compensate for this by turning itself into a dark comedy.",1416787200,,1063,4.552631578947368
8738918,5,B0036DBM4Q,"Great surprise when I first saw this movie on Netflix.  I knew my mother would love the humor in this and she does not have Netflix, so I bought her this movie...I was right...she loved it!  She has since shared it with many friends.  Great movie!",1395532800,,247,4.326086956521739
8738919,4,B0036DBM4Q,"This is one of those over looked small budget films crying out for a larger audience.
What I would change - edit out about 15 minutes of the middle of the film. You will see what I mean, this portion ambles without being necessary to the plot, it drags, not so the rest of the movie
What I liked -  the characters and the actors who played them, and like What's Up Doc, the plot offers up surprise twists and turns about every ten minutes, it draws on small town America in the same sort of way that Sordid  Lives or Dancer, Tx Pop 79 bo, it's a fun movie that most have overlooked. Keep an eye out for the three  on the box cover, they deserve a larger audience",1393804800,,662,4.076923076923077
