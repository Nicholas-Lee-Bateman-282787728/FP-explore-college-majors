Tony Zierra shows a unique view of Hollywood and the rise and fall of aspiring actors. This roller coaster of a film almost never saw the light of day due to pressure from Hollywood to keep it from being released. Congratulations to Mr. Zierra for continuing to press ahead and finally making this film available to us the viewers. Follow the lives of these four actors and one director... the highs of initial success, the crushing disappointment of watching your friends and housemates succeed while you continue to struggle for recognition, the cataclysmic fall from the public eye... It's a heartbreaking, raw and at times terrible look behind the scenes that will shock and disturb you. You must see this film!",1232323200,2,841,4.767123287671233

3140433,5,B001565ALM,"Now I get why the slogan for this documentary is ""Are You Ready?"". I can tell you that I wasn't. I assumed that it would be a fun maybe juicy trip through what it's like to get exactly what so many of us would like to have: fame and fortune. think about how many people, myself included, have wished we could trade our ordinary ""normal"" lives for the glamour of Hollywood. Not that I ever thought I would really go for it but we can dream, can't we? This documentary was a real wake-up call for me. Funny but watching it made my holiday better because it made me appreciate my life and my family more than I usually do. I felt like this hype about how great celebrities lives are is just that...hype. There's nothing real about it. Obviously getting famous messes with people big time. I was always confused about that. For instance, why do so many big stars from Marilyn Monroe to Owen Wilson seem so self-destructive when they have everything? This documentary helped answer that question for me. Honestly though, it also made me feel guilty for pushing my daughter, who is 19 toward being an actress. She's really talented and I guess I felt a little bit like she might have a chance to live out the dream I always had but didn't go after. We watched this movie together and afterwards she told me that she'd rather  go into nursing and I'm glad. On a kind of funny note: the guys in the movie are all really good looking in different ways so there's that to add to your viewing pleasure.",1230422400,,1491,4.382671480144404

3140435,5,B001565ALM,"I had the very great honor of attending the debut of this film at EyeCon in Orlando, FL, September 27, 2008, with actor Chad Lindberg and director Tony Zierra in attendance.  It was an unforgettable experience.

The movie starts off with the hi-jinks and madcap behavior one would expect of a house full of aspiring young *male!* Hollywood actors.  They are crazed, they are irreverent, they are risque, they are up for anything you can imagine because they are all here looking for that Big Break.  Living with the four aspiring actors is a young film maker, Tony Zierra, who takes it upon himself to chronicle the landmarks of their journies.  The results are ... unexpected.

Never have I imagined such an unflinching look at what it takes, what it means to reach for stardom in Hollywood.  We watch these youngsters strive and struggle, we watch them crash and burn, we watch them get up and keep slugging until ... hey.  Look at that.  The cameras and the lights are looking at not one, but *three* promising actors who just happen to be friends and house mates.  The parallels of their upward climbs is dizzying, exhilerating, amazing, even while the not-so-upward battle of the fourth friend just can't quite get that break.  It seems like just the luck of the draw ...

Until it dawns on us, the viewers, just how funny this all is not.  In the end, it is brutally, painfully apparent that ""success"" in show biz is sometimes just as bad as, if not worse than no success at all.  It would be a troubling film if it were fiction.  It's downright unnerving to realise that everything we see ... is real.  These are actual people, these are actual lives, and the young man pensively *not* looking in the camera, speaking softly about wanting ""something real,"" is not an actor in his own life.

The closing scenes of the movie pick up the foursome several years down the road, when their fellowship is long sundered and their paths have diverged, and one of them isn't even returning the others' calls.  For anyone who has ever thought, ""Hey, they're celebrities, they should be used to it,"" or who has ever wondered why our best and brightest stars burn out too young ... you need to see this film.  It will change the way you view the industry forever.

I hope to see this in general release soon.  Best of luck, Chad and Tony.  Thank you for coming to EyeCon.  It was awesome to see you both.  :-)

8257612,5,B001565ALM,"If you are living as a human being you can relate to this movie.  Seeing the entertainment industry as it really is; a job.  A hard job that you might not be hired for even if you have all the right stuff.  The passion that these men have for their craft is admirable.  I felt as though I was there with them through every step.  I wish only the best for all of them.  I think people can take great messages from this film.  Life is not easy.  If you want something you have to fight for it everyday.  Sometimes, just wanting something isn't enough and you have to know what is right for you to do.  I will watch this movie again.

8257613,5,B001565ALM,"10 years ago I googled Wes Bentley, the character with the camera in American Beauty, and came across a website for a film called Carving Out Our Name, a documentary about four actors and an aspiring director living in a house they called ""Masselin"". In the late 90's, Tony Zierra decided to start filming his four roommates as they tried to make it in Hollywood. You can call it luck, you can call it foresight, whatever the case, three out of four of the guys living in the Masselin house eventually got their big breaks, and Tony was there to capture it all.

Carving Out Our Name, starring Chad Lindberg, Brad Rowe, Greg Fawcett and Wes Bentley, got its big break when it screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2001, but the tragedy that took place the morning after changed everything and Carving Out Our Name went into hiding for good. I had always hoped the film would see the light of day and this year it has. My Big Break is Carving Out our Name's Father. It's older and wiser, but mostly it is fearless.

It's surprisingly easy to relate to these guys as they struggle with success and fame and all that comes with it. It's even easier to relate to the one guy in the house who has to sit back and watch with envy as his three roommates make a name for themselves in Hollywood. At one point the director asks him to do something, anything, and what follows is at once equally hilarious and utterly heartbreaking. Tony Zierra's directorial debut is thoughtful, provoking and painfully real. It's non-fiction at its best.

What I loved most about this film is the fact that the person telling the story is as much a part of it as the rest. The character with the camera in American Beauty come to life.",1315785600,,1741,4.485804416403785
8257614,5,B001565ALM,"Being an actress I personally really enjoyed this documentary.
You get to see the highs and lows of making it or not making it in the tough acting Hollywood industry.
You get to see behind the scenes, everything past the hair, make up, designer clothes and flashing cameras.  You see tears, anger, depression, drug addiction.  Everything!

It's truly fantastic that it was documented and caught on camera.  A true honest look at the industry and the affect on the actors lives.

I love this!!!",1313971200,3,493,4.821428571428571
8257615,5,B001565ALM,"I watched the re-released film My Big Break last night.  For anyone interested in the Hollywood Dream and ""making it"" in the Business it's a must see.  Remember Wes Bentley, the camera guy from American Beauty?  Or how about Chad Lindberg from The Fast and the Furious and October Sky?  Or maybe you recall Brad Rowe, who starred opposite Sean Hayes in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss?  These were the hot young actors, and they were going places!

You might ask, ""What happened to those guys?"" The answer is not pretty.  Filmed over ten years, director Tony Zierra, captures four struggling actors in Los Angeles as they attempt to break into the industry, auditioning, screen testing, and goofing around at their apartment in Miracle Mile.  Amazingly, Rowe is given his big break in the film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss. Lindberg and Bentley are quick to follow with October Sky and the Academy Award winning American Beauty.  The fourth roommate, Greg Fawcett, jealously looks on as his roommates are driven in limos and flown to sets around the world.  He breaks down in the climax of the film, screaming and running around naked in an open field.  He is a man alone, chasing an unrealized dream.

The illusion and fame slowly fades for the three movie stars.  Brad Rowe orders Zierra to turn the camera off him after his subsequent films fail to match the success of his first movie and Wes Bentley starts to become increasingly aloof and existential about the meaning of fame and reality.  Chad becomes so obsessed with being a leading man that he attempts to have plastic surgery to alter his chin and nose.  And that's only the beginning.  We're left to watch as these three actors fall as quickly as they've risen.

My Big Break is an excellent documentary.  The film joins the ranks of other great Hollywood myth shattering classics: What Makes Sammy Run, All About Eve, and Day of the Locust.  Zierra is to be applauded for having the gumption to get this film made and have it distributed after failing to find a backer in LA.  As for the actors, I won't ruin it by telling you how Bentley, Lindberg, and Rowe end up.  The funny thing is, you wouldn't believe any of this story if it wasn't real.  The pull of the dream is so strong.  But as they say, ""that's Hollywood.""",1312761600,2,2283,4.6525
8257616,5,B001565ALM,"I won't go into any specific details about the plot but I do have to say this is the MUST SEE movie of the year, hell of many years. If you want a reason (or many) to watch it, read on.

I am a movie lover, (to the tune of owning over a thousand DVD's of every variety and genre) and so many movies these days are afraid to be as honest as this one. I am more than happy to grant a glowing recommendation to a movie that I really enjoyed (and thought was a truly powerful movie).

In fact, I don't remember EVER seeing such a poignant movie about the truth of Hollywood. If you are a fan of movies, or actors or entertainment in general, go out and buy this movie NOW. This is a brutally honest look at the harsh reality (sometimes hilarious, sometimes tumultuous) of an actor's life. Anyone even considering being in this business in ANY capacity should watch this movie, and take notes.

The film is not only honest and raw, it is entertaining as all get out and full of insight into not only the life in Hollywood, but the life of each of these great actors. The film industry would be better off if movies like these were funded and shown in theaters everywhere instead of swept under the rug or dismissed completely from the limelight. I think that with the volume of celebrity 'news' that is shown to us on every channel and internet connection across America (about trivial things like who is dating and who is pregnant or broken up), that this REAL look at the plight of REAL actors (and not just 'celebrities' looking for a headline) is a welcome change. These REAL actors and the REAL director that filmed them should be on the forefront of the film industries next generation. Thing should return to when they were about talent, and this movie is a HUGE step in that direction.",1239580800,,1788,4.363363363363363
8257617,5,B001565ALM,"I can't believe the makers of this movie haven't promoted it as being Entourage in real life--except if Turtle and Eric are successful actors, too. In My Big Break, you follow the (real-life) careers of four young aspiring actors who live together in a messy house in LA.  Three of them make it fairly big--and one of them, unbelievably big (Wes Bentley, who did the amazing job as the troubled kid in American Beauty).  Then things start to fall apart, and Wes's career (among others) starts to crumble. (Vincent Chase, anyone?) This movie is an amazingly honest, searching portrayal of the Hollywood star machine, and how it eats people up.  It's unlike anything I've ever seen before.  I loved it.",1233964800,5,700,4.808333333333334
8257618,5,B001565ALM,"""My Big Break"" is an astonishing achievement in documentary filmmaking. In telling the true story of the struggles of four actors and one filmmaker trying to make it in Hollywood one might say this is the most raw, honest, and enduring tale of tinsel town since the mythic and fictional ""Sunset Blvd.""
  It not only chronicles the rise of three young actors to sudden breathtaking fame but also the flatline of the fourths attempts at a career. And of course what the film is ultimately presenting is the fascinating tale of the film itself being made and trying to make it within the insular and cannibalistic land of the lotus-eaters.
  Brilliantly shot, edited and narrated by director Tony Zierra this is a must see for anyone with the slightest interest in Hollywood behind the scenes. (Or in pursuing a career there.)  It is harrowing, funny, and deeply moving. I never expected to get sucked in by this but I must admit by the last entry from Wes Bentley juxtaposed by what the ultimate outcome of the tale turned out to be, well I nearly wept at the loss that was presented. Whether it is Hollywood, Hong Kong or San Francisco and you are a movie star, or an average Joe on the street it all boils down to what life is and what it can do to a dream and ultimately the dreamer.
  The score for the film is by a young rising talent out of Liverpool, David Ben Shannon. His contribution to the film is impressive. The score ranges from hip Hollywood sound to a few well places musical homage to films of the past. See if you can spot them. The score soars and supports the film just where and when it needs to.  Overall a fine debut by an artist we will be hearing more from in the future.
  And I am sure more great things will come from Director Tony Zierra. A strong, passionate filmmaker who deserves at last his ""Big Break""!  Five stars and Bravo!",1233187200,2,1857,4.432352941176471
8257619,5,B001565ALM,"The considerations that I will intend to do about the movie are very personal ones, once all that each person who watch My Big Break has is the footage and the edition it was provided by the director Tony Zierra - marvelously through an extensive work from more than 200 hours - in selecting what it better would tell the story. As it is impossible to access directly `the thing', all we can do is having perspectives on it and on the actors' ones.

The story, told somehow in a Greg Fawcett's perspective is very interesting. Western societies are oriented to separate people in winners and losers. The other actors were making it big, but Greg who were struggling for a little more time and even with a good looks, weren't. Why this? And then, this is the first major question that the documentary opens. He could be an Adam Sandler, but in fact this wasn't happening.

And in a point a little ahead we find an answer to stardom and even to the movie: even being good actors (Brad Rowe and Chad Lindberg IMHO spectacular actors), if they were J. Roberts, J. Travolta, T. Robbins, B. Willis, T. Hanks and so on, would they be as cruel and as distant as these are with ordinary life questions? `Who are we?' and `who do people tell we are?' are together a question. They trusted the industry and they were a bit distant when they got the chance. All of us would probably do the same...

Zierra is - as the director, as well as one directly of the team - in strategic moments of MBB orienting as well as actively participating with the right questions. The questions he made during the doc were directed straight to the point and the actors gave him their richest feelings (or so much they could verbalize) at those moments. `Turn it off, Tony', that scene made me still puts tears in my eyes. He pointed out the exact questions, not to tell just a story, but to investigate the actors' souls. And the movie has a very good work provided by the producer Elizabeth Yoffe. I sincerely would to see more from them for the near future.",1232496000,,2030,4.436997319034853
