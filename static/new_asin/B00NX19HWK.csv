8680874,3,B00NX19HWK,"Night of the Living Dead, 1968 film

""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" starts this movie. They drive to a cemetery to visit their Mother's grave. An old man walks toward them, then another man attacks Barbara, who defends herself. Strange men try to get in her car! She runs away screaming. She sees a farmhouse and runs toward it. Its front door is locked, nobody at home. Stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. Something falls from the second floor! A pickup truck arrives with a man wearing a suit. Any shotguns or rifles inside? The man pushes a zombie out the door. Barbara uses a steel rod against another zombie. [Is there an explanation for these anomalies? If its not nuclear tests then it could be Global Warming!] Can the zombies be stopped? Can you kill the dead? They must stay in the farmhouse until help arrives. [No telephone service?]

Night falls. They have electricity. The radio has ""trash talk"", people who talk as if they know something when they don't. Ben and Barbara take out the trash, then talk about what happened. Only a shot to the head will stop them. Ben finds ammunition, there must be guns in the house. Ben finds one (the previous owner has no need for it). They find other refugees in the house. The truck is out of gas, is there gas kept in the shed? Should they hide in the cellar? Ben says no. They learn what happened earlier. There are personal conflicts. Ben orders boards nailed over the glass windows for protection. Barbara sees more zombies approaching the house. The activities provide shocking surprises! The television tells of an emergency. Will Cooper cooperate? Can they work together? A zombie tries to break in, but is stopped. Barbara shows her marksmanship skills! She gets more bullets. Cooper hears the TV broadcast news.

What is causing people to act like that? What if the recently dead should come back to life? Is it a widespread virus? Judgment Day? There is more personal conflict inside. Can they find the truck keys? Yes, but they need gas for the truck. More zombies gather around the house, a flaming torch keeps them away. The gas pump explodes and the truck burns. No escape now. Ben fights his way back. Cooper fights with Barbara for the rifle! What happened to Sarah? Can Barbara get help? Zombies break on through to the inside! Is there no escape? What will happen when they run out of bullets? The morning brings help, armed men and a helicopter. The zombies are disposed of, then place on a huge pile. They find one in the cellar. Barbara gets the last one! She watches the burning pyre. What is she thinking now?

The original 1968 monochrome movie was a low budget production from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania that was a surprise hit in the spring of that year. It resonated with the audience somehow. This is a copy that has some changes from the original story. Was it better? The original was more restrained, perhaps due to the censorship of that era. The story didn't offer an explanation for its impossible premise. What happened in the other parts of the country, such as urban areas? Will they ever offer a third version? Not if there is no paying audience. Does this uprising symbolize the threat from the huge debts of the past? They can't be ended with a well-aimed rifle shot. You may like this movie more if you never saw the original, which was also average.",1482278400,,3349,4.642495784148398
8680875,5,B00NX19HWK,"What could be better than a restored and digitally remastered version of this cult classic? Nothing on earth! This film from the late sixties has all the ""in-your-face"" taboos loud on display, such as; necrophilia, incest and of course, cannibalism! What more can one ask for in a zombie flick? The story is a perfect cliche in that a group of people (who had been rehearsing for a musical) end up trapped inside a farmhouse while flesh-eating zombies roam the countryside. Without the ingenuity of such an insightful director, George Romero, we wouldn't have such later legends as Wes Craven and John Carpenter. Maybe it is that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is all in black & white, perhaps it is the graininess of the film that adds to it's mystique, or maybe it is because some horror is best left in it's simplicity, whatever the case, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time!",1429401600,,890,4.639240506329114
