8020399,3,B000228T0Y,This DVD wasn't what I expected because I thought it was extra episodes of the show but it was an overview of the series.,1392940800,2,121,4.083333333333333
8020400,4,B000228T0Y,"At first I wasn't crazy about the plot of this anime. A friend picked up the OVA a few years ago and we watched it. It's about a cantankerous high school orphan, named Chitose, who gets adopted by his female teachers and the school nurse. Their goal: to make him into a respectable young man. What won me over was the relationship between Chitose's adoptive sister Minazuki. As I saw the TV series, I appreciated the characters more and since then it's been a favorite of mine. The anime has it's humorous moments such as the teacher moms abusive methods of taking care of Chitose. It also has some poignant moments such as Chitose's time with his adoptive sisters from his youth.
I especially liked the opening and ending songs in the OVAs.

It should be noted that there are actually 5 episodes in the OVA. For whatever reasons, ADV only released 3 of them, so the last 2 can be difficult to find.

If you're looking for an anime with a good mixture of comedy and drama with a nice variety of different characters, Happy Lesson is a good title to look into.",1376352000,2,1059,4.453608247422681

8020403,5,B000228T0Y,"Happy Lesson is a story about Chitose, an orphan who inherits his parents huge house and quickly finds himself with five completely insane mothers, who are also his high school teachers. In his own words, his life is over. You have the childish and playful art teacher mom, the does she even have a brain bear woman gym teacher mom, the overly traditional Japanese priestess school nurse mom, the mad scientist, did I mention mad, science teacher mom and the study till you drop home room mom. Add to that his rock star older sister and sweet little sister, and the class president with a big crush and you get the picture.

Happy Lesson OVA is more of a prequal to the series then a follow up tothe television series. The OVA consists of 3, 25 minute episodes. The first episode is an etended rehash of the first episode of the series which just isn't as good the edition though off the rythem of the episode and actually make it worse for wear. The other two cover the introduction of Chitose's two sister and are actually pretty good and gives you a far better feel for their characters, even if they don't show up that much in this OVA.

Now to the actual review well, there isn't much to say things don't get much better then Happy Lesson. The animation is extremely well done with fluid movements and attractive character designs. All the characters are likable and you finds yourself becoming fond of all of them. The music is light and happy like everything in the series. Though not as side hurtingly finny as the series the OVA is still pretty fun though it does have quiet a bit more fan fair. Don't get me wrong this series still stears clear of pervy and dark stuff for the most part, thisi s a light happy nonserious series.  The only thing that detracts from Happy Lesson OVA is the price and the fact that you only get three episodes.

In the end if you want to check out this series or just want to finish off the frnachise pick this one up. If you want something to watch and enjoy buy this one, if you have any taste at all buy this one. In other words but this one you'll be happy you did.",1175212800,4,2109,4.358778625954199
8020404,3,B000228T0Y,"The first episode is a expanded version of the first episode from the series.  The other two are brand new, expanded episodes, dealing with swimsuits, Christmas and sisters.  The episodes are funny but not that funny.  They are touching but not that touching.  The extras include sketches, opening and closing songs (which are new songs) and trailers.  75 minutes of humor and moms!
If you are a fan you may wish to get this disc, but get it used.  With only three episodes it's not really worth getting new.",1114128000,3,508,4.651685393258427
8020405,4,B000228T0Y,"Hello there! If you love Romantic Comedies like Love Hina or Please Teacher, you're going to enjoy Happy Lesson:  Mama Mia Ova series. After following Chitose through fourteen episodes of man abuse mayhem by 7 beautiful women, you would think that there wouldn't be anymore insanity left. However, that my anime loving friends, is were you would be wrong! The beginning starts off hilarious with an alternate version of the very first episode. Next, you join the whole family as they take a vacation at a quiet  sea side resort. And finally, the holiday season will never be the same after you've spent a crazy Christmas with Minazuki, Hazuki and the five Moms. Poor Chitose, We only watch what he goes through with these girl for an hour or two. But he has to deal with them 24-7!
A must see, must own, Romantic comedy!  Enjoy!",1088380800,4,828,4.657534246575342
