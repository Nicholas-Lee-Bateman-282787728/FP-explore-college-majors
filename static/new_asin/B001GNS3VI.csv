3616973,3,B001GNS3VI,"BOUGHT IT BECAUSE D.B. SWEENEY WAS IN IT, BE COMPARED TO HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE CUTTING EDGE. HE WAS TERIBLE",1325376000,,108,4.45
3616974,4,B001GNS3VI,"While I agree that the movie is not 100% realistic, it is still probably the most true-to-life unemployment movie I have ever seen. Yes, in real life the chef would have a lawsuit on his hands against the city, which he would pursue; He would probably not give up on his restaurant just because there was construction in front of it. Also, Missi Pyle was miscast as Liz. She should have been played by someone like Parker Posey or Janeane Garafalo. It's hard to believe that someone who looks like a model (as Pyle does) wouldn't be able to land some type of receptionist job in ten months. And the happy ending was telegraphed and foreshadowed in a big way.

But there were many, many moments that were heartbreakingly true. The bad advice from the employment agent (telling someone he could have a job if he really wanted one), the age discrimination, the hiring of someone for reasons other than his work skills. People who are unemployed have few movies that dramatize their experiences, at least since the mid-90's. Usually, characters hop from dream job to dream job in romantic comedies and realistic dramas. This may not be a perfect movie, but it is undoubtedly one of the best of its tiny genre.",1278460800,2,1205,4.657276995305164
3616975,4,B001GNS3VI,"Entry Level was a nice surprise.  The story is a light, funny look at the world of unemployment along with a bit of romantic comedy.  The leads DB Sweeney and Missi Pyle have an easy, unforced style; they are much more endearing than the typical quirky independent characters that push everything in your face.  Missi Pyle deserves more acting opportunities like this role.  The supporting characters, especially Kurtwood Smith and Taylor Negron, are colorful but not unrealistic.  (Sweeney's first encounter with Negron is pretty damn great.)  Plenty of good, honest moments between all of these people as they hunt for jobs and vent about resumes or being too old...  I loved the discussions on the awesome sandwiches made by Sweeney's character.  Whenever someone mentioned an unusual ingredient, I totally got hungry.",1228867200,4,821,5.213740458015267
3616976,5,B001GNS3VI,"This film is a charming and fun ride with great performances and some funny and timely commentary on corporate America, the American dream and how they don't always go hand in hand. The performances are delightful with a particularly charming turn by Kurtwood Smith as D.B. Sweeney's homeless friend and advisor. Funny and uplifting. I highly recommend checking this one out!",1228262400,4,375,5.163934426229508

8306344,5,B001GNS3VI,"As someone who has over many years gone from low to high, and back again to low level jobs, this movie strikes a chord. It's almost too personal to comment further. Employers are not kind to people of older ages..40-?  But, what it comes right down to is finding something you enjoy doing, no matter what the income or price. So many people work at jobs just to get the paycheck. I would pray that people could find a way to do what really matters to them....something they love as a way to make a living.  But, a sad example of how this world treats people....many school teachers love to teach their youngsters, but they are paid a pittance compared to professional sports playetrs or movie stars. People will get what they will out of this movie. It touched me....oh yeah, and made me smile too.",1509494400,2,798,4.458904109589041
8306345,5,B001GNS3VI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The cast is wonderful and the plot was a bit more based on reality than some people would like to admit. If you think that situations like this could never have happened, I offer you my sincere congratulations, because you've managed to survive nicely through life without being clobbered by the reality of how small business owners can be treated by the real world.",1509321600,2,398,4.782608695652174
8306346,3,B001GNS3VI,"Slow, Slow ,Slow movie .. He is a chef that had bad luck , than tries to give up what he knows the best to
go into some boring job he knows nothing about , while people are eating sandwiches and raving about
 how good they .. He has no clue DA  Boring anybody who goes to a top culinary chefs school and graduates,
dos not give up that easy ..",1506988800,,343,3.816901408450704
8306347,5,B001GNS3VI,"Small and excellent movie with outstanding cast.  I'd say more of a chick flick, but enjoyable to all.  Story about how difficult it can be to start again, and again!  Absolutely real, great dialogue and I ended up loving all of the characters!",1501545600,3,244,4.627906976744186

8306349,3,B001GNS3VI,"If you only watch this for the scene with Taylor Negron interviewing DB Sweeney then it worth it. I saw this movie at a film festival 7years ago and have remembered that scene ever since. The rest of the movie is pretty uneven, but it is still entertaining.",1397347200,,257,4.375
