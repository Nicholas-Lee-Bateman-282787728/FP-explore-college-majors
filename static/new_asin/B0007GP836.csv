2211726,5,B0007GP836,"I found The French Revolution (History Channel) DVD to be very informative and interesting. This is a period of history that is difficult to understand, but this DVD helped me gain an understanding of how people can change circumstances and how circumstances can change people. I enjoyed the DVD and learned a lot.",1127088000,9,314,4.943396226415095
2211727,5,B0007GP836,"For those that know the famous,and most likely apocryphal, quote attributed to Marie Antoinette and little else about the French Revolution, the History Channel has finally produced an excellent documentary on this seminal event in world history.  Enhanced with re-enactments and the usual historian/author commentary, this DVD brings the complex and bloody history of the French Revolution to life in a way that will entice the masses.

The French Revolution is without question one of the most important events of the 18th century if not world history in general.  It's ultimately tragic end, culminating in the Reign of Terror and the execution of even it's own outspoken creators ,adds to the drama of what was to be the crowing achievement of the Age of Enlightenment.  From Louis VIX and Marie Antoinette to Robespierre and Danton, this documentary covers it all, if not in fine detail, then just enough to motivate the interested viewer to research more on his or her own.

The French Revolution and its effects on the world stage have never been more accessible.  This video was entertaining and educational and is recommended for teachers, students, and the amateur historian.  Vive la France.",1125360000,63,1202,5.133333333333334
2211728,5,B0007GP836,"I had a lot of hazy details about the French revolution, but no real understanding of the big picture and the roles various famous people played in it.  Nor did I completely understand the transition from king to Revolution to tribunal to Napoleon.  This production puts it altogether in a very informative yet most entertaining way.  It made the events and people seem as real as when I viewed (at the Conciergerie) the long list of those guillotined in Paris during the various Terrors.  This dvd would be a wonderful introduction to the times for a class or for the casual reader of history.",1123891200,10,594,4.6826923076923075
2211729,5,B0007GP836,"There is a vast amount of information on the French Revolution that can be found in scholarly texts, recreational articles, Internet sites, as well as a large selection of documentaries that have been produced over the years. A great number of these sources are well worth a look at for the serious student as well as the part time historian. Without hesitation, this documentary should be at the top of the list, because it is not only a perfect introduction, but also an extremely well produced and informative film.

The History Channel has produced many well-made and educational documentaries over the years. One would have to admit that their Biography Series is second to none. But they have really out done themselves with The French Revolution, as it covers the numerous causes of this important insurrection, focusing on major personages in the aristocracy, the enlightenment and the key political insurgents, painting excellent portraits of Maximus Robespierre and the mad journalist, Marat, leading to their ironic and bloody ends. The Reign of Terror is depicted particularly well with all its high drama, intrigue and endless flow of blood. Interestingly, these portraits of the major players in the revolution, Robespierre, Danton, Marie Antoinette and Louie the 16th, were all done with such pathos, that I came away from the film feeling real empathy for these people, especially Marie Antoinette. This is the way history, as a subject, should be taught, evoking feelings for the people and the times under study.

The documentary combines images, well-acted scenarios and informative interviews with academics including a compelling narration - it is also very well written, as it is tremendously difficult to cover such a complex event in a short time and do it any justice. If you have any interest in The French Revolution, an event that virtually changed the world, this documentary would be a suitable starting point. It would also be a worthwhile teaching resource for students in the middle years and above.",1114473600,149,2032,5.154545454545454
2211730,5,B0007GP836,"I glossed over the French Revolution back in junior high, but was not able to recount much years later.  Because I don't have the time to read up on French history, I decided to check out this DVD.

First off, I was very pleased with the information I received from this program.  I could easily look up the info from the web in a matter of minutes, but I doubt I could have learned as much as I did from the DVD.  Quite simply, the program is done like a story (with visual reenactments) and laced with interviews from scholars.  The result is that you're entertained from start to finish, while understanding the conflict and events that are being described.

And what's nice is that although the program isn't too long, it doesn't rush anything: we learn about Louis XVI's rise to the throne, his relationship with Marie Antoinette, and what led to their deaths.  Robespierre and Marat's background are also analyzed, as they were both major players in the revolution.

In all, a great DVD to own.  I've been watching PBS and History Channel documentaries/programs for some time, and I was pleased that this production was done well.  Although I wasn't too educated on the French Revolution before this DVD, I felt that the program was done with detail and accuracy.  I definitely recommend it!",1109808000,65,1297,4.6946902654867255
2211741,2,B0007GP836,The DVD was defective and I had to return it. I was very frustrated.,1435449600,,68,3.9285714285714284
2211742,5,B0007GP836,"Edward Herrman was not only a great American actor of stage, television, and film but also the voice of the History Channel. His voice is here in narrating the history of the infamous bloody and deadly French Revolution. His voice was one of great depth and range. Like many great underrated actors, he could recite Shakespeare or the telephone book listings with eloquence and passion.

In this ninety minute documentary, Herrmann narrates the French Revolution with insights by scholars and authors on the subject. The documentary also infuses re-enactments carefully overshadowed by narration and insights.

If you want a great documentary about the French Revolution, the History Channel provided the best and informative documentaries about world history.",1434240000,,760,5.487179487179487

2211744,4,B0007GP836,"This is a relatively objective documentary about the French Revolution, presumably produced before History Channel decided that pseudo-scientific shows about ancient aliens were more lucrative. Only humans have been included on this program, and no UFO interference in the dramatic and frequently bloody events of the revolution is alleged.

The initial section of the documentary covers the background to the French revolution: the famines and the fiscal crisis, the lack of real democracy, the nobility's sabotage of all reform proposals, King Louis XVI's constant indecision, and the notorious jet set living of Queen Marie Antoinette. While she never actually said let them eat cakes, it does capture her general attitude. The ideas of the Enlightenment are mentioned as an additional factor behind the revolution. An ironic fact I didn't know about previously, is that Maximilien Robespierre and Louis XVI actually met before the revolution during a royal visit to the law school where the future Jacobin leader was enrolled!

Most of the documentary focuses on Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat, the Reign of Terror and the power struggles between the revolutionaries and the king. The Girondists and the revolt in the Vende are mentioned only in passing. Lafayette and Paine are not mentioned at all. The documentary stops right after Thermidor and the execution of Robespierre, with a certain Napoleon Bonaparte still lurking in the background

Perhaps it's inevitable that a 100 minute program on the French Revolution gives Robespierre centre stage, but the story nevertheless feels somewhat incomplete. That being said, it's still a good introduction to the subject, and well worth watching. The French Revolution seems to exist in several different versions. The one I watched had a female narrator. Surprisingly, one of the talking heads interviewed is Alan Woods, the leader of the British-based International Marxist Tendency (IMT) and a supporter of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. I suppose he was included for balance, since the historians interviewed are more critical to the Jacobins or the revolution itself.

An interesting question (as in may you live in interesting times) is whether or not the French revolution will repeat itself, since the world  despite all the official optimism  is heading for a very severe crisis. The crucial difference between 1789 and 2015 is presumably that today, even the Third Estate eats cake. What kind of oath they will swear when peak oil, climate change and overpopulation bankrupts their pastry shop, is a frightening thing to contemplate. Robespierre may have been a crazy ultraleft, but I suspect the next revolution will be headed by somebody like Le Pen. If that's a good thing, is another matter entirely.

I suppose we can always ask those friendly space aliens to save us",1430524800,,2828,5.299107142857143

2211758,3,B0007GP836,"Parts of it were good, but it did not include anything on Napoleon, whose military dictatorship, crowning of himself as emperor, and massive imperialism, including the invasion of Russia which killed 90% of his forces, showed the ultimate failure of the revolution, based as it was, like the Russian, on mob rule, terrorism,  envy, jealousy and resentment.  Those evils ruled the Revolution and bloodied it forever.

PBS has some of the greatest DVD's offered on the subject of history. Usually working with the History Channel this particular DVD is a prime example of how well they present their material. The narration is always interesting. the action of sequences and visual imagery is superb! PBS does not have some cheap budget and waste their time on mere pictures. No, the images are always captivating and fast moving as the story moves right along. The commentaries are usually unbiased and just present the facts about the era concerned. I loved this DVD and have watched it a couple of times already. A great resource and just plain enjoyable presentation on what otherwise might be a dry subject. Thank you History channel and PBS.

+if you are new to the subject, the 100 minutes provided by the DVD will give you a brief overview of the French Revolution.

+GREAT if you are an audio/visual learner.

-Shallow compared to what you might read about the French Revolution via Wikipedia

-For documentary and/or history lovers, you also might find the information to be too general for your tastes. The audio and visuals is where documentaries usually make up ground versus print, but it's not enough to necessarily warrant the purchase price.

Granted, it makes valiant effort on one DVD but anyone who has read the Wikipedia entry or watched the Khan Academy overview may not find much more than what they already know.",1385078400,,732,4.91869918699187

It is generally appropriate for school use, but be sure to preview it carefully, esp. toward the beginning, as it addresses Louis' (sexual related) medical issue.

2211776,4,B0007GP836,"This documentary serves as a very good overview of the Revolution - starting with the marriage of Louis and Marie Antoinette and ending with the death of Robespierre.  If you're looking for something in depth, this ain't it.  However, if you just want the general order of things, it's well worth the price.  I see no use for this in a full course on the Revolution, but it should be helpful (at least Chapters 6-11) for a quick lesson on the great revolution.

The DVD doesn't include a menu card, so here's a layout of the DVD:  Ch 1 - Political Alliances  is runs 0-10:25 and covers a stupidly brief intro, Versailles, wedding of Louis and MA and the lack of an immediate heir. Ch 2 - The Enlightenment (10:26-15:15) too brief to be of any use, but does talk about Louis' first meeting with Robespierre which is a real gem!  This also talks about the American Revolution and the French Response. Ch 3 - Mme Deficit (15:16-19:57) Marie Antoinette's spending sprees. Ch 4 - Financial Crisis (19:58-26:25) Financial reforms, harsh winter, food riots, first meeting of the Estates General. Ch 5 - To the Bastille (26:26-30:10) Paris essentially goes nuclear. Ch 6 - The People's Friend (30:11 - 39:45) Declaration of Rights of Man, constitutional monarchy, women breaking into palace. Ch 7 - Foreign Assistance (39:46-49:27) Austria and Prussia make moves on France; royal family's attempted escape. Ch 8 - Death of the King (59:13-1:10:09). Ch 9 - Noble Blood (59:13 - 1:10:09) Importance and murder of Marat...fyi, best film coverage of this event I've ever seen!  Ch 10 - Defending the Border(1:10:10 - 1:19:05) fall of the Church in France, foreign intervention. Ch 11 Civic Virtue (1:19:06 - 1:29:42) Robespierre's meteoric final rise...and then crash, cult of Reason, influence on other nations (this bit entirely too short).",1268438400,3,1830,4.899676375404531
2211777,4,B0007GP836,"This video did just what I hoped it would: it gave my teenagers in AP European History an overview of the subject. There's a lot to the French Revolution, of course, and it can be hard to grasp the whole scope of it at once. The History Channel did a good job of presenting the whole thing, though with the usual looping and reusing of video bits (eg, you see the same legs storming Versailles a lot of times). It did a good job of unifying the whole era in the person of Robespierre, showing that he started out wanting favor from the king, had the king beheaded, and ended up a failed suicide, going to the guillotine himself. I thought it presented all of the people and issues involved clearly.

2211778,4,B0007GP836,"Of the many shows I have seen on the History Channel, this is easily the best, as was one of my earliest introductions to the subject, which came to be one of my main areas of research. The musical score is fantastic (I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the soundtrack separately as well), and it was fascinating to see the events portrayed live by a group of skilled reenactors. However, the only reason I did not give this show the full 5 stars is the failing of the show, towards the latter half, to maintain an even handed balance on bias. Obviously history will always have a bias, but the attempt to show alternate biases weakened. First of all, the early patriots seemed to be made into more progressive or liberal than they actually had been. Then the show is highly sympathetic to both Louis Capet and Antoinette, the former throughout the whole and the latter for the second half of the program. But more disappointing was the portrayal of Robespierre as a monumental figure throughout the whole show, when in reality he had no real power until the Committee of Public Safety, and moreover the lack of any attempt to make sense out of the Terror, making it appear almost random or as the product of Robespierre's ideology alone. I am not saying they had to necessarily be sympathetic to the Terror, but they did not even try to dispel the myth that Robespierre was the source of the movement or explain the extremity of the situation or the pressure from the Paris Commune and insurrectionist forces that actually invaded the National Convention and called for more extreme measures. While I realize that the program must be limited in scope due to severe time restrictions, but nevertheless a bit more effort to provide possibly explanations could have been exerted. Nevertheless, it was a terrific production, and I would still recommend it both for the personal viewer and amateur historian as well as for an introductory tool for the classroom.",1264032000,4,1960,4.733918128654971

It would have been a real shame had the History Channel done a poor job on one of the most important periods in history. With that said, they clearly did justice to their name and reputation with this outstanding production.

I must say one early reviewer had much sympathy for Marie Antoinette.  I can't say I share the same feelings in view of the lack of compassion Ms. Antoinette had towards starving, oppressed French people whom the Royalty hoarded flour from.

2211792,5,B0007GP836,"The French Revolution is a History Channel documentary shedding light on one of the most important events of Western Civilization. The documentary follows a pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of the French Revolution by using many available sources in describing and discussing King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Marat, Robespierre, Danton, and events leading to the French Revolution (1789).
The movie does a good job of transporting the viewer to 18th Century France and presenting the French Estates system.
We get a taste (though a very light one) of France's involvement in the American Revolution (beginning in 1778).
Moreover, we get to see and hear about some of the lies and propaganda that helped shift public opinion against the Queen as well as the fact that King Louis XVI did not wish to rule and was forced into that position following the death of his grandfather Louis XV.
The film is also excellent in showing the raw brutality and excessive force of the Revolution.
The only major setback is in relation to the History Channel's bias in openly shunning Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and scorning the French monarchy.
Unlike many of the History Channel's recent documentaries with a biblical theme that are heavily biased, fictitious, and speculative, such as The Exodus Decoded, The French Revolution is very well written and very well presented allowing for a thought-provoking documentary that will provide food for thought well after it is over as it offers valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.
The History Channel's The French Revolution is strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), and Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu), as well as to a lesser extent Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), for those with a soft spot for French History.",1212364800,2,2011,5.307210031347962

2211795,4,B0007GP836,"The French Revolution, a DVD set by The History Channel, will be of interest to a wide audience.  Well-done reenactments, paintings, interviews with leading historians, and the narration of Edward Herrmann help viewers get a better appreciation for the French Revolution and its impact on European and world history.  The History Channel does a good job in covering the events, including the American Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the New Republic in the 1790s C.E.  Furthermore, The History Channel explains well the interactions among the main protagonists of this bloody, chaotic, and transformative period.  These protagonists were among others king Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, Jacques Necker, Maximilien Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat, George Jacques Danton, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, and last but not least, Napolon Bonaparte.  To its credit, The History Channel clearly articulates the institutional developments at the apex of France and the vain attempts of the other European powers to nip the French Revolution in the bud.  To summarize, this DVD set reflects with conviction on a watershed series of events that like the Industrial and American Revolutions thoroughly changed the course of human history forever.",1183593600,4,1288,5.579487179487179
2211796,4,B0007GP836,"This year marks the 218th anniversary of the beginning of the Great French Revolution with storming of the Bastille on July 14th 1789. An old Chinese Communist leader, the late Zhou Enlai, was once asked by a reporter to sum up the important lessons of the French Revolution. In reply he answered that it was too early to tell what those lessons might be. Whether that particular story is true or not it does contain one important truth. Militants today at the beginning of the 21st century can still profit from an understanding of the history of the French Revolution.

There are many books that outline the history of that revolution. I have reviewed some of them in this space. Probably the most succinct overview, although it was written over one half century ago, is Professor Georges Lefebvre's study. For those who want a quick visual overview of the main events and political disputes the History Channel production under review has a lot to recommend it. The production covers all the main pre-revolutionary problems confronting France at the time, including its terrible debt problems caused in the main by its support of the American Revolution, to the political, social and, yes, sexual inadequacies of Louis XVI. As has been noted by many commentators on revolution, including myself, one of the prerequisites for revolution is that the old regime can no longer govern in the same way. The personage of Louis XVI seemingly fits that proposition to a tee.

The production goes on to highlight the key events. Obviously, and most visibly, the storming of the Bastille that opened up the cracks in the old monarchial regime. It details the struggle to create a constitutional monarchy through the various legislative assemblies that sought to carry out the reforms necessary to bring France into the modern age short of declaring a republic. And also the attempts, including by Louis himself, by forces of the old regime to return the old monarchy or stop the revolution in its tracks. When those efforts failed and the revolution began in earnest the production details the internal struggle by the revolutionaries, most notably the great fight between the Girondins and Jacobins for power, and the formation of the republic. After the defeat of the Girondins this led to the further fights to `purify' the revolution among the Jacobin forces and the reign of the Robespierre-led Committee of Public Safety that consolidated the gains of the revolution through the `Reign of Terror'. Finally, the downfall and execution of Robespierre in 1794 represented the reaction that most revolutions exhibit when the political possibilities for further leftward revolutionary moves are no longer tenable.

There are many great scenes portrayed here as well. The murder of Marat by Corday. The Festival of the Supreme Being. The oratory of Danton and many more scenes that give one a pretty good general feel for the dynamics of the revolution. Included are `talking head' comments by noted historians of the revolution giving their take on the meaning of various events. This is a plus. The major negative is in the axis of presentation. Almost fatalistically the emergence of Robespierre is intertwined throughout all of the earlier events giving the impression that he was inevitably bound to take power. And, also inevitably, due to the excesses of the `Reign of Terror' to lose it. This may be good documentary presentation form but it is bad history. Revolutions, particularly great revolutions, are few and far between. They are messy affairs at the time and as seen through the historical lens. Nevertheless if the social tensions in society could always, or should always, be resolved in a nice non- violent parliamentary way there would be no revolutions. Damn, where would that leave us as the inheritors of the sans-culottes tradition?",1182988800,4,3848,5.066246056782334

2211800,2,B0007GP836,"I watched this film yesterday at a library, and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding.

During the first minute, they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising.  During the next 99 minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence, using acted scenes, fake blood and sound bytes from ""scholars"", to give a ""play-by-play"" summary of the carnage and beheadings, leading up to a mention of Napoleon.

During the last thirty seconds, they surprisingly conclude by saying that the French Revolution was a very good thing, because it inspired China and Vietnam and because Louis was a tyrant.  Prior to this little or no mention had been made of Louis' tyranny, although the film had dwelt on his  bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times.

After watching 90 minutes of bloody scenes, I found the films conclusion that the French Revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur.  I would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion.",1173657600,63,1097,4.9945054945054945

First, the consequences of the Revolution are given short attention--while many mundane facts are played out to unnecessary length at the beginning of the film.  Secondly, the role of Robespierre is overstated and the contributions of so many other people, forces, and groups are underreported.  Both are somewhat minor quibbles.  My advice to those who wish to learn about the French Revolution is to have other resources available that cover these two areas.  Some background of 17th and 18th century France and Europe would be invaluable as well as providing viewers full biographies of the movers and shakers in France at the time.",1167436800,10,757,4.929133858267717

The reenactments were superb with good paintings, authentic customes and illustrations of this period of ernomous upheaval in France as well as Europe. The commentaries by a selection of historians were very well done.

The documentary vividly brought to light the chaotic scenes during the dramatic and far reaching events of the Revolution complete with the mindless violence and bloodletting in the Reign of Terror. The heavy fighting by the French Forces during this period against the various coalitions that were determined to crash the Revolution added to the misery and suffering of the French people.

I was wondering if the history channel ever followed up (Napoleon et al) using the same narrator? PBS's Empires-Napoleon is alright, but the narrator is not as enthusiastic, and plus im looking at a wider context, not just Napoleon's history. I know he shaped France in specific, Europe in semi-general, and the world in general, but i would still like to take off where this one left off. if anybody knows, plz list it in the page's forum or something.

2211808,5,B0007GP836,"This documentary essentially narrates and reenacts the events of the French revolution.  As we listen to the story, we view paintings, historical documents, actors in period clothing, and shots of the places where certain events took place.  It is fast paced and accompanied by gripping music.  For those already familiar with the history of the French Revolution, it might be a little disappointing as it is not very in depth and there is little analysis.  However, as an introduction to the subject, it serves its purpose well.

The documentary emphasizes both the bloodiness and the radical nature of the event.  Up until this point, France was a hierarchal society in which the privileged few lived extremely well and the masses lived in poverty.  People accepted this situation, more or less, because they believed that this hierarchy was natural and sanctioned by God.  However, the Enlightenment challenged all these ideas by asserting that all men (they weren't so sure about women) had the same moral rights.  By this reasoning, one could no longer justify the great privilege of a small minority and the poverty and starvation of the masses.  Many looked on at what was happening in France with horror; they saw a world turned upside down as the brutish, ignorant under classes slaughtered their king and queen, aristocracy and clergy.  For many, this seemed anything but ""natural"" and ""just.""

The great irony of the revolutionary project was that violence was the means to bringing about a more just society.  In fact, towards the end of the revolution, Robespierre called for the return of virtue through violence.  As Lynn Hunt says, one of the most important questions posed by the revolution is: how much violence is justified when fighting for changes that you believe are right?",1149638400,26,1796,5.04406779661017

This presentation gives background and context. The huge cost of supporting the American Revolution, the bitter winter, the foolish decisions by the King, the new enlightenment beliefs, the hatred of feudalism and aristocracy, all connect.

The calling of the estates general, for first time in over a hundred years, and the resulting step-by-step revolution is well explained.

Robespierre's change from opposing the death penalty to the foremost user is documented. Proclaiming the need for 'The Rule of Terror', in the name of 'Reason', is stunning.

Rise of Napoleon and the war against Europe is shown. Europe and its aristocracy wants this new ""enlightenment'' stopped. Napoleon wins, even though he loses. The enlightenment and the German revolt - Romanticism - change Europe permanently. Leads to Marx and the European wide revolts of 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871 (first modern communists), and then brings 1914 and Lenin in 1917.

(See J. L. Talmon - ''Origins of Totalitarian Democracy'' - for an astute analysis. Also, Rosentock-Hussey - ''Out of Revolution'')

Good combination of the impact of ideas and leading players. The French Revolution is a milestone on the road to the present. Many of the ideas, problems, conundrums, are still controlling modernity. Reason vs religion, individual freedom vs collective control, authority of the elite vs will of the majority, majority tyranny vs minority rights; all are still troubling the present. This is where it began.
