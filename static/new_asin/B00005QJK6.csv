7950771,1,B00005QJK6,"This is one of the slowest-moving films I've ever seen.  Quality movies that move at a snail's pace compensate with either stellar dialogue, well-developed characters or first-rate acting (""Driving Miss Daisy"" is a good example of a film with all those qualities).  None of those things apply in this film.  I watched the entire film with the hope that its climax/conclusion would engage me on some level.  I'm saddened to say it didn't.  In the end, ""Caged Terror"" was a major disappointment; I felt cheated and robbed.  Even its low $6.99 sale price doesn't justify the purchase of this film.  If you must see it, I recommend that this film be rented, and only from a DVD rental-by-mail service, so you won't have to pay the flat rental price.",1194652800,5,745,4.728682170542636
7950772,1,B00005QJK6,"Slow moving; bad acting; don't get it; don't rent it; don't look at it. Total waste of time. I could find no redeeming qualities about this movie.
The only reason it even got one star was because I couldn't submit without it (and I really wanted to warn people).  This movie was absolutely horrible!",1188172800,5,299,4.537037037037037
7950773,1,B00005QJK6,"I AM REQUIRED BY HONESTY TO CONSIDER THAT THE EXCELLENT REVIEWS GIVEN THIS MOVIE ARE THE RESULT OF THE CRITICS HAVING UNKNOWN TUMORS IN THE PRE FRONTAL LOBES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BRAINS.THE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION IS HALLUCINATION SECONDARY TO NERVE GAS ABSORBTION. IF YOU WERE GIVEN THIS CD FREE THEY OWE YOU MONEY FOR SEEING IT. IF,IT BEING A PLASTIC INSULATOR,WAS ABLE TO PROTECT YOU FROM A KILLING ELECTRICAL SHOCK IT STILL WOULD NOT BE WORTH BUYING. IT'S EXISTENCE IS A PERVISION OF COMMUNICATION BY MEDIA.",1183248000,5,510,5.011764705882353

7950775,5,B00005QJK6,"The movie is really good.  I went nuts when the black guy told the white guy that, he had the girl on ice.  Everyone should buy this movie.  It's good, and so are the directors and key grips.  The gaffers are equally as good.  Watch this movie or die!

I just watched it again........and had a seizure, but it was worth it.  Moreover, I want you all to know that this movie was made in 1972.  It makes me crazy to know that Steven Spielberg actually passed on this title, and later sued the cast for punitive damages.

Jim Baker once told me that you could get people to give up their money if you just believe in god.  I believe in Jim Baker, and Jim Baker loves Caged Terror.",1126483200,5,677,4.138461538461539
