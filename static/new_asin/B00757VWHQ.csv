8510476,5,B00757VWHQ,"The main feature on this Blu-ray disc runs for 40 minutes and approximately 13 minutes is spent touring each of the three parks.

The parks are featured in an order that represents climbing the Grand Staircase from south to north. Information on history, geology, wildlife, famous lodges, prominent landscape features and some trails all add up to a fascinating glimpse of arguably the best three national parks of the Grand Circle. These are places I have not visited myself as yet but a trip is planned within the next few years and this programme has really inspired me to make sure I get there sooner rather than later.

The quality of the production is top notch including fabulous sound and picture quality (sounds great on a good home theatre system), expert narration by Bob Barnes, beautiful background music and superb photography and editing. You are left wanting more but I guess you need to go to these places to have that desire fulfilled!

This is just one of many incredible products from Finley-Holiday Films and you will not be disappointed with this Blu-ray product.",1343260800,,1085,4.885869565217392

The results are spectactular, as you can see on this DVD.

Zion is a particular favorite of mine, with the riparian Virgin River area as an island of green in the middle of desert. Bryce looks great in winter, touched by snow, as well as spring.

Just about any Finley-Holiday video will be worth your money. High-quality shooting, good cinematography, informative voice-overs and very fitting musical scoring all add up to make a great series.

Plus, videos in the Finley-Holiday series normally have bonus features, such as sidebar attractions in the area. And, they film in all seasons of the year, something you and I can't do on a single trip.",1136160000,2,836,4.516556291390729
