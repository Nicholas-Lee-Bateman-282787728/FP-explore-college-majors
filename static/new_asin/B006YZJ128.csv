8506700,5,B006YZJ128,"Nicely done biography. Like Pele said: Ferenc Puskas was the greatest footballer of his time, yet without receiving much publicity. I am very grateful knowing him as a friend.",1440374400,,175,5.068965517241379
8506701,5,B006YZJ128,"What a great movie, what a great story. What Puskas had to overcome was amazing and how late he started in Real Madrid and still achieved so much. A must see if you like real Football (Not sure what soccer is), enjoy a fantastic movie.",1371945600,,235,4.2444444444444445
8506702,5,B006YZJ128,"I saw this film in the cinema at the Hungarian Film Festival in London in 2010. I'd been given a ticket by someone who knew it would be good. How right he was. I'm so glad I went along, though I'm ashamed to say I'd never heard of Puskas before seeing this. When I came out of the cinema I clearly understood that he was a sporting great - one of the best soccer players of all time.

It was the most extraordinary experience. I quite like football (as we call soccer in the UK), but this wasn't a ""football"" film. The way it tells the story of Puskas and what he did had me gripped throughout (and moved to tears at some points). It cleverly intercuts interviews with film of Puskas and his contemporaries playing. He was such a lovely man too, magnanimous and a little eccentric.

This film is, inevitably, not only about football - it's also indirectly the story of Hungary during the Cold War and I gained insights into that too.

I'm thrilled I can now get this film on DVD. It'll be something I'll treasure. If I could give it 10 stars I would.",1355270400,2,1050,4.266331658291457
