6602148,1,B00MUF60E8,"Freaks and Geeks is a five star show for sure. Every single episode is hilarious and you can relate to almost every character in a way. My rating is based on the price for this. I understand there's a lot of ""interviews"" and ""extra footage"". But it's only one season! If the price ever drops, I'll consider purchasing this.",1457308800,17,323,4.491525423728813
6602149,3,B00MUF60E8,"Get a netflix account for $10 and watch the whole series in a weekend. Unless you NEED it on blu ray and care about interviews you can probably watch on youtube, then avoid this. Waste of money.",1457049600,10,194,4.27027027027027
6602150,5,B00MUF60E8,"An amazing show and ahead of it's time.
This Bluray (HD Version) of this series not only gives you the original 4:3 aspect ratio it also offers a 16:9 as well in 1080p. With a new interview with Paul Feig and Judd Apatow.
If you are like me and purchase the DVD Yearbook addition, the Blu-Ray version will have a digital version, or just the DVD complete series the extra features are pretty much going to be the same.
If you want the pretty sharper picture of this show get this box set. If you are fine with the Standard Definition version that you own, you'll want to get this for the eye candy crispness.",1457049600,18,608,4.2956521739130435

6602153,5,B00MUF60E8,"Freaks and Geeks was rhe BEST SHOW ever on TV, incredible soundtrack music in all episodes, I've seen every episode at least 5 Times - and I'm not finished yet !. The series appeared on Time magazine's 2007 ""100 Greatest Shows of All Time"" list, as well as placing third on the magazine's list of greatest television shows of the 2000s  In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time[and ranked it #1 on their list of 60 shows that were ""Cancelled Too Soon""

This series is also highly reminiscent of 2 of the best 'teen' movies of all time, 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' and 'American Graffiti""
It also reminds me a lot of Wonder Years. John Frances Daly as Sam Weir is a lot like Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold, and Martin Starr as Bill Haverchuck was similar to Josh Saviano as Paul Pfeiffer Some of my favorite moments are when James Franco gets his hair made up as a punk rocker so that he can impress one of his favorite ladies, Neal using his ventriloquist dummy to get revenge at his parent's cocktail party, Martin Starr playing spin-the bottle at the make-out party...each episode is just  priceless !!!

6602155,4,B00MUF60E8,"The ultimate high school show of all time. Blurays look good. Hoping for GREAT but good will do for now. Still far superior to the DVDs. This show from Judd Apatow (the man who brought us ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and a slew of other popular comedies introduced the world to James Franco, Jason Seigel, Seth Rogen and a slew of others is a must see.",1482969600,,362,4.260869565217392

6602158,1,B00MUF60E8,"You have to be kidding me on the price for a one season show.  The sales price for Black Friday is a disgrace, let alone the original price.  The show was decent back when it came out, and should have gotten more than a season, but it also wasn't amazing.",1480032000,4,255,4.08

6602161,1,B00MUF60E8,"The price of this is unbelievable. Great show, but stop at The Exchange for a $10 copy... or get a free trial on Netflix and check it out. Do not waste your money on a ""complete series"" that happens to be only one season.",1461456000,5,221,4.045454545454546

Comparing to the 1080p HD versions on Netflix streaming, these bluray versions just so much better. I'm not a videophile to really describe all the detailed differences but I'll say the motion and clarity of the video just looks far better. It makes the show even more engaging. I feel like I'm noticing more detail in the expressions of the actors. A really cool collectable version of the show, I'm very pleased to own this set.",1511049600,2,531,4.720430107526882

8674685,5,B00MUF60E8,"Short lived, but well lived like a character of legacy in real life.

Freaks and Geeks kick-started many a comedy enthusiast's career, obliged itself to a nudge for some, and became a sensation that was cemented into comedy so uniquely that it was tragic to see it go.

This collection gives us a two-fer. Not only do we get the original full-screen presentation of the show, but we now get the widescreen editions of all the episodes. They come as separate cases, so there is no confusion. You get the usual assortment of extras, good video and audio, and a nice case to fit it all in.

This show had Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Knocked Up, Ghostbusters 2016) helm it with support from Judd Apatow (whose catalog is so much more substantial and has had occasional Feig influence), Within only a handful of episodes, you see an actor from the Apatow catalog appear, such as James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, with occasional appearances from various others. The show had done much within the episodes it had to work with, leaving room for much more but getting outdone like so many.

The big kicker is the music. This show, like many, used licensed music for much of its tone and presentation. Because so many notable artists had music in the show, it created a difficulty trying to produce physical copies of it. Fortunately, Shout! Factory came through and managed it and went a step further to give us this. It's perhaps the best consolidation of the show you're going to get.

If you're a fan of comedy, this show is worth adding to your catalog. It's the Breakfast Club, done Apatow/Feig style and manages to do it well.",1502582400,,1625,4.648083623693379
