8582266,4,B00CJ00N24,We spent a lot of time watching youtube videos of shimajiro and I preferred to have the DVDs on hand. It is pricy but I could not find cheaper DVDs online. The videos are sometimes really weird and hilarious. The songs and dances are cute. Also you need an all region dvd player.,1388188800,,279,4.283018867924528
