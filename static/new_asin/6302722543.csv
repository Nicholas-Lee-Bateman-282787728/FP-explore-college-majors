502828,4,6302722543,"This is a Saturday night movie if I've ever seen one.
A Screwball comedy.
All the actors seem to be having a ball starring in it.
Penelope Ann Miller is cute, sexy and dynamic as Betty Lou.
Her transformation from frumpy plain and timid to cute, hot and dynamic is worth the price of the movie.
Other than Other People's Money, maybe her most fun and entertaining role.
Lucille Ball would have been the star if it was made in the 1930's.
Alfre Woodward and Julianne Moore show a surprisingly tremendous comic talent.
Quite a change from their usual serious and troubled characters.
This movie is fresh, fun and frenetic.
William Forsythe is still menacing, but with just the right comic touch this movie needs.
He would have been even better than Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"".
I saw this movie on cable at least twice.
Jumped at the chance to make it a permanent part of my DVD collection.",1269216000,,892,4.58125
502829,2,6302722543,"Shy Betty Lou (Penelope Ann Miller) who rightly thinks of herself as a dull, small town librarian, injects a little excitement into boring life by confessing to a murder her cop husband is investigating in Allan Moyle's comedy, romance, thriller.

It all starts when Betty Lou finds a discarded gun, a weapon used in a recent murder, in a park. She dutifully takes it to the police, but she's ignored until she fires it and confesses to the crime. Taken to jail, the mousy librarian is transformed into a bombshell by some of her fellow inmates.

Sandra Bullock might consider a remake of this oddball film because it's not the crime that really matters here, it's the change Betty Lou experiences as she takes control of her life. Of course, the loose ends of the story are tied up and Betty Lou even saves her marriage.  And it's all triggered (pun intended) by a gun.",1252454400,,870,4.6
502830,3,6302722543,"The singer in the bar scenes (mentioned by a  previous reviewer) is Steve Pryor, the ""best guitarist you'll never hear"".  He is from Tulsa, Oklahoma and has an impressive list of accomplishments including his own CD's.  Apparently there's no soundtrack CD from this movie available. Too bad.  Also, there are several good shots of the keyboard player, David Busey.",1124928000,2,364,5.11864406779661
502831,4,6302722543,"""The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag"" falls under the same category as other beloved late 80's/early-90's films put out by Touchstone Pictures such as ""Adventures in Babysitting"" or ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.""  Certainly not enduring works of cinematic brilliance to be studied by film students forever, but charming little films that hold a ton of entertainment value nonetheless.  Not to mention these films also serve as windows into what life was like in the late 80's and early 90's, a much more innocent and light-hearted time in American pop culture.  Penelope Ann Miller is delightful in the title role.  And the supporting cast is brilliant as well.  Eric Thal plays her less-than-appreciative cop husband who will mend his ways by the end of the film.  Ray McKinnon is the cop sidekick who reassures Betty Lou's husband that Betty Lou will definitely learn plenty from a night behind bars and that his own wife Joan could use the same.  Julianne Moore plays Betty Lou's kooky sister.  Cathy Moriarty is brilliant as the hooker Betty Lou meets in prison.  And Alfre Woodard delivers a delightfully comic turn as Betty Lou's novice attorney.  The violent scenes are a little heavy-handed, but I think it serves the plot well as it shows just how much trouble Betty Lou stirs up for herself and the people she cares about.  Overall, just a great, feel-good, early 90's comedy that definitely rewards repeated viewings.",1100822400,8,1432,4.949790794979079
502832,4,6302722543,"This flick suprised me as I was not expecting much. And I did not get much, but what I got was light, fun, well acted, and well-written with likeable, attractive and believable characters. It is good for an evening in with popcorn. Laughs in several places and some suspense.",1075680000,9,275,4.63265306122449
502833,3,6302722543,"Although it has its good points, this film is generally of the quality of a made-for-TV film--not something I'd recommend buying or renting.
Betty Lou is a librarian who's not getting the attention she wants and arguably deserves from her police officer husband.  He's more interested in his work than her.
There's a murder in their town involving a travelling man who's having an affair with a local married woman.
Betty Lou (with her dog) happens to discover the murder weapon.  To gain attention she proclaims herself the murderess. Betty Lou, of red hair, is a sympathetic character and it's fun to see her snub all the interrogating male cops (including her husband) who take her for granted. She also befriends a local prostitute while in jail and otherwise asserts herself as she hasn't before.
It's not all fun, however, for there are some southern Mafia characters about led by a particularly evil man named Bodine (how original).  There are a few scenes of gratuitous violence that were a big turn off.
The climax is somewhat improbable but something you might expect in a TV movie.
Also, there's a scene in a country bar where the singers (names unknown) recreate faithfully the great Gram Parsons/Emmylou Harris duet of ""Love Hurts.""",1055808000,4,1245,4.919047619047619
502834,4,6302722543,"This is one of those screwball comedies that you find yourself watching in reruns every  time you catch it on TV. The premise of the movie centers on Betty Lou, a rather mousey, small town librarian who is married to a cop. One day, while in the park, Betty Lou discovers the gun that was used in a recent murder. She takes it to the police, but no one will pay any attention to her. In frustration, she fires the gun and winds up confessing to the crime! She wants to prove that she isn't as mousey and predictable as everyone seems to think she is - especially her husband! While in jail she is given a transformation into a sexy bombshell by several of the other women inmates. When she appears for her arraignment no one (least of all her husband), can believe it's her.
Once out on bail, however, Betty Lou realizes that she must discover who the real killer is before it is too late. What follows is an adventure that only a once mousey librarian can have -- an adventure that reveals not only Betty Lou's hidden beauty, but her smarts and cunning and style.
Granted, this isn't the funniest movie to come around the pike, but that isn't it's allure. No, what makes this so appealing is Betty Lou's transformation. She stands in for every woman who has ever been underestimated,taken for granted, pigeon-holed, and ignored. She decides to take charge of her life in a very dramatic way and in the process she saves her marriage, she saves the day, and, more importantly, she saves herself.
Watching Betty Lou rise to the occasion is reason enough to watch this movie. Seeing her take charge of her life is reason enough to enjoy it.",1022976000,22,1638,4.478260869565218
502835,1,6302722543,"I recently rented this movie thinking it was a screaming comedy, which is how it was described on the jacket.  Comedy?? Get real!! I thought it was an outrageously sick movie, with violent scenes that would turn the stomach.  Not for the faint of heart.  And certainly anything but comedy.  A bad plot and equally bad acting.",1018828800,4,325,4.649122807017544

502890,5,6302722543,I love this movie!  Have seen it multiple  times and laugh every time.  Hard to describe it in just a few words:  An ignored housewife decides to make severe changes after finding a gun.  How and what changes make this movie a riot!

502895,4,6302722543,"This is a modest and silly early 90s comedy starring a very good comic actress, Penelope Ann Miller. The whole plot about the depressed housewife coming alive after confessing to a murder she didn't do is, well, pretty silly. But so what? There are lots of good laughs here. And the supporting cast is pretty amazing for such a trifle--Cathy Moriarty, Stanley Tucci, Alfre Woodard, and pre-star Julianne Moore. I found the quality of the blu ray to be okay, esp. for my cost of $1. No complaints there.",1375574400,,502,4.651685393258427
502926,3,6302722543,"The DVD quality is better than some will lead you to believe, especially for the price. As for the story, it's a another cute Saturday afternoon popcorn film that Disney's Touchstone Pictures churned out in the early 90's.. Many familiar faces pack the cast (some before they were famous. Betty Lou (Miller) is lying for attention, especially from her cute cop husband (Thal).. the jist of the story: She finds a gun one day while in the park with her dog. She tries to turn it in and no one listens.. so when the gun turns out to be a murder weapon and she's a suspect now because she used the gun in a store bathroom while venting, and now to be lively, she refuses to say she didn't murder the guy. Really?? The story is silly & unbelievable.. and sort of insulting..  and in real life, she wouldn't be going free, she'd be charged and going to jail for lying to police, tampering with a criminal case, perjury etc.. (that's the world we live in, like it or not).. So while it's supposed to be cute, I guess if you're over 12, it's frustrating.. It does have it's moments though, and the real reason to watch is for Cathy Moriarty - she's always fun..",1366588800,,1154,4.367441860465116

502929,2,6302722543,"The movie is OK, mildly amusing, one or two lol moments. The Mill Creek blu-ray, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The film itself was upconverted, not remastered, to high def. No movie on blu-ray should look that soft and grainy. It only has a Dolby 2.0 audio track, and for the second half of the movie it was out of sync. Good thing I only paid a dollar for it at a dollar store. Yeah, it's THAT cheaply produced.

502933,5,6302722543,"Betty Lou is just an unappreciated housewife who helps out at the town library were she is also unappreciated.

The being unappreciated part is where the fun starts.  Her husband takes her for granted and spends all his time at his job (police detective), so much so that Betty Lou begins to think he may be having an affair.

So she follows him on one of his late night call-ins to a motel and she listens at the window as the police inside discuss a crime scene where a local bad guy has just been killed.

On her way home, her dog recovers a pistol (the murder weapon) just barely in the water beside the river.  She takes it and puts in her purse (hence the title).  She takes the pistol to her husband's station to turn it in, but no one will pay her any attention.

After her attempts to get her husband and his fellow officers to listen to her and pay her some attention meet with total indifference, she confesses to having an affair and killing her lover using the information she overheard while hiding outside the motel, after which she starts to get some attention.

This movie is (FOTFL) falling on the floor laughing funny, while at the same time pointing out the levels people will go to to just be noticed.",1339804800,,1222,4.376106194690266
502934,5,6302722543,"Penelope Ann Miller.  She has played lots of parts and made lots of movies.  A movies.  Carlito's Way.  B movies.  Relic.  And even a couple of C movies.  That dumb movie about the bottle of wine.  I've been following her career ever since dinosaurs roamed the earth and she has never given a bad performance.  This film is one of her early efforts.  It didn't get much attention or make a lot of money.  But she is so charming and so engaging.  It must be difficult to be an actress with big talent and small boobs as opposed to one with little talent and big boobs since you know who seems to get all the best parts these days.  Nevertheless, Penelope Ann is consistently good in every role she plays, and this film is no exception.  While she may not be Meryl Streep, Miller definitely has Streepiness.  Trust me.  All the guys in my cell block were cheering at the end.  I don't think it was just because a guard got stabbed.",1313020800,5,929,4.308139534883721
