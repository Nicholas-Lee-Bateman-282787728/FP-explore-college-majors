2477322,4,B000E0WJKK,"It's refreshing to finally see a snowboard movie on the big screen.  However, I was hoping it would be more like the Dogtown and Z Boyz Documentary.  Someone who reviewed this film thought that Shawn White got very little footage, are you kidding me?  This film was one big advertisment for Shawn White.  I don't deny his ability or his domination of the contest circuit but personally, I'm sick of all the hype surrounding this kid.  You could have cut out over half the interview with him and replaced it with actual riding or possibly more footage on Nick Perata.  His presence was  virtually non-existent.  And while we're at it, why not include a big mountain rider such as Victoria Jealouse?  She's one of the best out there, but as usual women rarely get any coverage.  I did enjoy the vintage footage from the days of yore and the trip to Alaska but would have been happier with strictly veteran riders on this trip.  The footage on Terje was excellent, and there should have been more.  Snowboarders out there old enough to remember classics such as ""Snowboarders in Exile"" may be a little disappointed with this film.  But, it far excels the last 7 or 8 years of crappy Snowboarding flicks that feature nothing but rail riding and gap jumps.  In this one, big mountain riding finally gets the attention it deserves.  It's nice to see Farmer out there again.  We've missed him.  I'd like to see a film with the reunion of the fall line film crew.  Dave Seone, Steve Graham, Damien Sanders, etc.  Overall, the fim was pretty good and I would recommend it for anyone looking for big mountain riding and a little history.",1142121600,4,1627,4.606271777003484
2477323,5,B000E0WJKK,"In terms of story and content, this is probably the strongest film ever made about snowboarding. Gorgeous photography and a really solid storyboard made this film a real motion picture rather than a collection of montages like you see so many other boarding films. Unfortunately this film lacks the real jaw-dropping moments you really need in a film of this caliber. This film has one or two, but needs more to really sustain the interest level. Terje Haakonsen was spectacular as always, though, and any film blessed with his participation is almost always sublime.

On a side note, I was a little disappointed in Shaun White's performance in this film. It seemed as though his heart was not really in the big back-country experience and that he would have rather stayed at home in the park. As a big fan of his riding, I was hoping to see more of his awesome freestyle ability translate to the open terrain. I was surprised to see him board with his freestyle binding setup (wide centered stance) rather than something more conducive to powder riding. I think the film crew noticed the lack on enthusiasm and actually showed him the least of all the five riders in the actual boarding scenes (they showed plenty of his interviews).

Overall though, I'd strongly recommend this film to any snowboarder who is truly interested in the sport.",1142035200,11,1341,4.800865800865801
2477324,3,B000E0WJKK,"I guess if you want the history it's cool.  If you have seen other snowboarding videos with actual snowboarding this one is pretty boring.  75% interviews and bs and very little actual riding.

The actual riding is pretty cool though.  The riders are awesome, the video is just a little slow.",1140739200,8,292,4.666666666666667
2477325,5,B000E0WJKK,"This is a great documentary and thrilling movie.  Being able to see two Olympic gold medalists and snowboarding pioneers at the same time is a treat.  The cast is a diverse group that has one thing in common, the love of snowboarding.  It is a must see for winter sports fans of all ages.",1139961600,10,288,4.296296296296297
2477326,5,B000E0WJKK,First Descent is one of the best movies i've seen in the past couple of years. With the combined experience of all the riders in this movie it makes for one wicked awesome movie. Especially for those who love snowboarding. YOU HAVE TO SEE and BUY IT!! so you can watch it everyday!,1139011200,6,281,4.320754716981132
2477347,3,B000E0WJKK,"This movie was recommended when I purchased the Art of Flight.. It's not at all what I had expected. It is interesting at times, but pretty lame at others.",1357689600,,155,4.379310344827586

2477349,5,B000E0WJKK,it was a sweet movie it really showed how snowboarding evolved through the years and kinda showed where snowboarding is now,1323043200,,123,4.904761904761905
2477350,4,B000E0WJKK,"Take my words with a grain of salt as I have no snowboarding experience what-so-ever, but think it looks cool on television. First Decent shows some pretty intense action shot up in the Alaskan back country featuring future Olympic gold medalists Shawn White and Hannah Teter along with snowboarding veterans Shawn Farmer, Nick Perata, and Terje Haakonsen. It's a decent documentary mixed with the snowboarding footage that provides a solid introduction to the world of snowboarding, but there wasn't a lot of depth I felt for someone like me who doesn't have a deep snowboard background, I would've loved to have heard more about how the sport has grown. The presentation hinted on these things much like other reviewers have indicated, increased money, television exposure, more difficult tricks, etc. but lacked the depth I would've wanted. Also the mix of action and documentary kind of took away from the actual documentary portion because they'd go 20-25 minutes of snowboard stuff and then a chuck of documentary. Liked it, but could've been executed better.",1306022400,2,1065,5.161849710982659
2477351,3,B000E0WJKK,This movie was good. I was surprised to see how old it was being that Shaun White is only 18. It was a decent movie goes back on the history of snowboarding and switches back and forth to AK with Shaun and the crew. Terjae made this movie at the end with the first decent and it was SICK!!!,1286668800,,290,3.9322033898305087
2477352,5,B000E0WJKK,"this movie is over 4 years old and i still go back to it and watch it
best documentary on snowboarding i have seen to this day
watching two olympic medalists go through their first backcountry experience is so thrilling!",1276905600,,220,4.525
2477353,4,B000E0WJKK,"After viewing too many snowboarding and skateboarding videos featuring one trick after another by faceless people who you wouldn't recognize if they knocked on your front door, I was happy to find this gem. It's a manic lifestyle with intense highs and boring lows. I got to see the stars during downtime when it was raining or too cloudy to shoot. They are serious. There are antics but it's not a big party every night. I loved the avalanche scene and the snowflake that Shaun White palmed that was bigger than a baby chick.",1234051200,,526,4.6063829787234045
2477354,5,B000E0WJKK,"I wasn't a snowboarder until I saw this documentary.

It is truly inspiring to see the juxtaposition of Terje, Shaun, Hannah, Farmer, Travis and Nick. Seeing Terje do what he does on film just looks impossible. I can't describe how many times I rewound the footage in order to comprehend the physics behind what he did, let alone the raw courage it took to make such a drop. It just doesn't seem possible, yet he makes it look so simple to us ""Advanced"" riders. He's god level. Seeing a rider like Travis Rice follow the same lines as Terje was a great juxtaposition of talent as well. There was definitely a lot of thought behind the making of this film, it wasn't just on the fly like most snowboard DVDs out there. I feel ""Riding Giants"" and ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" come 2nd and 3rd to this film.

Big props to Farmer and Hannah for hittin that jump. I think they were about 10 feet short of making a smooth landing. Unfortunately there was a feature in the mountain that Hannah and Farmer both cased it on, the backlash was too huge for their bodies to absorb.

Major props to the 30mm telecine footage. You can tell there is a huge crew behind the lens making this happen, and these guys have done it before. And considering the hazardous environment that they were asked to film in, it's just a joy to see the footage that was captured in the comfort of my home.

The only criticism I have about the film was the injection of the history portion of the sport. That to me felt disjointed when I wanted to see Hannah riding with Farmer, or a back story on Nick. This history portion could have been in the bonus features of the DVD. I bet there is just a ton of more footage that could have been used in it's place (""more snowboarding action"" from bonus features). I do tread water lightly when criticizing the cut of this film, overall it's still one of my favorite sport documentaries to date.",1232928000,,1896,4.3931623931623935
2477355,5,B000E0WJKK,I really enjoyed this film on snowboarding.  It had a lot of great elements from the best boarders out there to the guys who once were as pioneers of the sport.  I loved it that they filmed it in Alaska and had some sweet shots of the mountains and terrain.,1222214400,,257,4.12
2477356,4,B000E0WJKK,"Young and old star riders meet up and rip big mountain powder.  Stuff of epic proportions.  Minus one star because it was too short and because I should be there riding, not here watching this dvd...",1221868800,,199,4.5
2477377,5,B000E0WJKK,A great in depth look into the history of snowboarding from it's backwoods roots to the megapipes of today.  Beautiful cinematography with a good story to wrap around the documentary. A must see for any Soul Snowboarder.,1212624000,,220,4.945945945945946
2477378,4,B000E0WJKK,"This movie is a nice change from the standard snowboard movie.  It takes you to Alaska with a well-varied group of riders, from multiple eras of the sports evolution.  Along the way, they give you an interesting history of the sport in a way that supports the overall story.  A key part of what made the film interesting is feeling like it was a special and meaningful experience for each of the riders involved.  Everyone had a different reason for being there, and something different to get out of it.

I wish there were more films made like this, that capture a special moment in time.",1206576000,,589,4.518867924528302
2477379,5,B000E0WJKK,"I loved the parts about the history of snowboarding and the last run of Terje in the end. You won't find many runs on big mountains as Standard Films movies, but overall it is very entertaining.",1206489600,,194,4.416666666666667
2477380,5,B000E0WJKK,"Seeing such legends of snowboarding ride free in Alaska, jumping off 100 feet (and fall sometimes) ride down 60 degree chutes escaping avalanches is just what I was looking for.
I saw part of this movie on YouTube, I had to have it.

Mostly about the history of snowboarding, from the first Burton Boards to Terje Hackonen, to Shaun White, the movie takes you for a carve trough the history and the dreams of the pioneers of snowboarding.
Probably has less riding footage than other movie, but what you see here you won't forget ever.
Good also for the general public, is just a well done documentary on the sport of snowboarding.
Interesting footage on avalanche control on the DVD.",1206403200,,683,4.691666666666666
2477381,1,B000E0WJKK,"This is a great movie if you like hearing smug little brats like sean white talk about how cool they are.  The snowboarding footage in this is a joke.  I cannot believe that reviewers have compared this to riding giants, which I found to be an amazing documentary.  This movie is simply a forum for snowboarders to talk about how cool and ""edgy"" they are.  I love watching winter sports flix, and I thought that this was a ridiculous waste of my time.  If I had actually bought it I would be pissed.",1203897600,2,499,4.32258064516129
2477382,5,B000E0WJKK,great DVD... awesome images and gives a good idea of how a professional snowboarder lives. Besides you have all the sport story... Excellent,1202688000,,140,5.130434782608695

2477385,5,B000E0WJKK,"I found the movie/documentary format of this movie very interesting. I've only been ""boarding"" for a short time, but found the history lesson tied into the story very refreshing. If you're expecting this movie to be just a bunch of action shots and videos set to music, there are plenty of titles out there that offer just that. This movie however has I think just the right mix amazing action shots, dialogue and as I said before, a little history narrated by one of my favorite people on the planet, a heavy metal rocker turned comedian by the name of Henry Rollins, perhaps you've heard of him?? It opens your eye to expanding your boundaries, not just staying on the groomed runs or the jumps and boxes of the terrain park, and looking to back country riding, definitely going to give this a shot come next season! So if even if you've been boarding from the beginning or just starting out, this movie is a must have in your collection! Oh don't want to ruin it... but I'll say this, Terje has a crazy run at the end of the film!!",1182211200,,1034,4.4188481675392675

Fantactic documentary about snowboarding with big champions ! i begun starting this sport 3 years ago (i am 41) and i want to do it for all my life ! thank u Shaun White, Travis Rice and the others to give me all of this energy

good quality image & sound",1178928000,,321,4.0
2477401,3,B000E0WJKK,"After ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" and ""Riding Giants"" -- documentaries that cover the similar sports / culture territory, ""First Descent"" arrived at the theatre. As you know, the film is about snowboarding which is getting more and more popular, and as it title suggests, ""First Descent"" includes the exciting footages about six riders snowboarding in the mountains of Alaska -- Shawn Farmer, Terje Haakonsen, Nick Perata, Travis Rice, Hannah Teter and Shaun White.

The film's topic is interesting even if you're not a snowboarder or a fan of these six athletes interviewed here, but I feel someone else could have made a better film with the same material.

The feature film runs almost 110 minutes and spends its time mostly on two topics: history of snowboarding as sports, and the six athletes' rides in Alaskan mountains. Some part of the former section is fresh and informative; I didn't know snowboarding is so popular in Japan where you can see the riders jumping in packed stadium of Tokyo Dome. The excitement of the place is like the Rolling Stones concert, proving the riders' popularity.

But the film gives me an impression that the treatment is a bit cursory. You hear words like `big' or `huge' many times, but we are not allowed to know how big or huge the snowboarding business has become. We are told that snowboarding progressed with time, but seldom is the film incisive as to how. I am not saying the film should be erudite as textbook; I am only saying that we need more original approach to it, something humorous or human that made ""Dowgtown and the Z-Boys"" a joyful watch.

The same can be said about the section that follows the six riders in Alaska. They are all likable persons, quite frank about themselves and their snowboard riding is amazing. Which made me wonder - How dangerous is it to snowboard on the mountainside that looks vertical, that conceals crevices here and there? How can they pick up the `line' or safe paths to go while jumping from the snow ledge? One of the riders got almost swallowed up by avalanche, but does that happen all the time?

I asked myself these questions while watching ""First Descent,"" but the film only keeps showing the mountain ride footages which are amazing at first, but soon becomes repetitious. ""First Descent"" has great material in it, but another way of treating it would have made a better documentary film.",1172707200,13,2380,4.795121951219512
2477402,4,B000E0WJKK,"This movie is great. Basically it's the film 'Riding Giants' (which is the best documentary you will ever see) but it's about the birth and evolution of snowboarding rather than big wave riding. Some great riding, some great stories and a few laughs thrown in. This movie is deifinantly one for the collection. It's also great to watch while eating your cereal in the morning.",1170201600,,376,4.8

2477406,2,B000E0WJKK,"This flick was nothing like I expected...and I mean that in a bad way.  I was looking for something to get me amped about the season, especially after being off the snow for a couple of years.  I saw Farmer's and Perata's names on the bill, and figured I couldn't miss with this one.  Some good, hard core Alaska back country must be in store for sure....WRONG!  One of my old faves is RAP film's ""It's the Source"", featuring good tunes for the day, and heroes riding amazing, scary stuff, fresh off the ""Alaskan Festival of Fear"" contest (yeah, that's really what it was called).  It was so good (though now a bit dated), I immediately concocted a trip to Valdez and loved it!  Yes, I admit you get a bit of that with ""First Descent""...but how many big air half pipe shots with flash bulbs going off, talking heads, people walking in slo-mo, or family interviews can a guy (or gal) take??  To add to the yawn fest was Mark (that dude from Devo) Mothersbaugh's sleepy soundtrack.  Listen, my fellow consumers, I rarely write a review on anything. But I feel it is my duty to warn the unsuspecting...if you want a mediocre, sleepy documentary with moments of greatness (offered by 5-10 minutes with Terje...who is still fluid and enlightened where ever he rides), then this is your film. If you want all out make-you-wanna-head-to-the-hills backcountry riding with a  kickin' soundtrack, look elsewhere.  And when you find THAT flick, let me know!
