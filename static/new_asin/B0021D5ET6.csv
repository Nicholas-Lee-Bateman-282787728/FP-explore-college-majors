3831835,4,B0021D5ET6,"A lot of my comments are technical, because I'm both an audiophile and the owner of a video production company that records symphonic concerts, so I will be describing things that many people may not have paid attention to in this review.

The Performance:
As with all Joe Hisaishi's concerts, his performances were stellar. And he does things on a grand scale not seen on this side of the Pacific. Possibly the largest stage ever set up for a concert, with multiple choirs and an orchestra so large that I counted five conductors all working their respective parts of the groups of orchestra members and choir groups. They covered a good range of Studio Ghibli soundtracks, all on the backdrop of a huge multimedia presentation of selected portions of these films. Mr. Hisaishi actually looked like he was enjoying himself--he looked happy and not a hint of strain or worry in his expression. The performance came off smooth and effortless.

The disc has extra features on it, including a ""Making Of"" segment, which covers the setup and rehearsal, leading up to the concert day, plus candid interviews with Mr. Hisaishi. We get to know a little bit about him, as for many fans in the US, he is a bit enigmatic due to not much material in the form of interviews like this. It is all in Japanese however, and there are no subtitles.

The Video Images (Technical)
The disc is 1080i and displays the typical interlacing artifacts, including aliasing and stair stepping when wide shots containing edge detail are shown. There is a certain amount of noise in some of the camera shots that looks like it's been processed to reduce the noise, but it comes through with a false contour edge enhancement with grainy appearance. Wider shots show limited resolution. Closeups look okay. Color balance varied somewhat from shot to shot, but overall was warm and pleasant. The moving crane shots made the visuals interesting and the choreography of the camera shots was good to excellent.

The Audio (Technical)
The sound quality of this recording was okay, but sterile. It lacked a real sense of detail, despite many microphones place in, on, or very close to instruments. The lack of a sense of front to back orchestra depth was prevalent. The recording suffers from the ""too many microphones mixed down"" syndrome. Many instruments were hard to hear, despite the number of microphones, or sounded distant, muffled or very low, relative to other instruments. The higher frequencies that give the sense of presence were lacking or very weak. It has the sterile sound of movie soundtrack recordings, which is a different sound from classical concert recordings, which tend to recreate a more convincing concert hall experience. Given the sheer scale of the concert, I'd say the engineers did a reasonable job of capturing the audio, though I think it could have been done even better. One last comment is that the noise floor of the venue is pretty high. It is August and the HVAC noise is prevalent during softer passages in the music.

Equipment Used in the Screening:
17,000 watt custom built surround sound system: frequency response 8Hz to 21KHz
12 foot wide acoustically transparent screen (154"" diagonal)
1080P DLP type projector, measured brightness on screen: 62 foot lamberts",1393804800,26,3271,4.929219600725953
3831836,5,B0021D5ET6,"Anyone that has kids, anyone that loves music, anyone that enjoys live performance... oh bother. BUY this - if you are displeased in the slightest...feel free to troll my in response comments to your heart's delight.

The video is very clean for capture in a live performance (it is not heavily post-processed footage with digital grading and post-production effects). The music is wonderfully captured with an appropriate balance between zero-noise-floor / close-mic'ed studio work and the white noise / background din normally working against live performance capture.

Seriously? Buy it...and I dare you not to smile by the end.",1391558400,4,631,5.363636363636363
3831837,5,B0021D5ET6,"As a lover of Miyazaki films, I was always tuned to the critical role the music played in the experience. Here, Joe Hisaishi conducts a tours of music - from Nausicaa to Ponyo - and the results are breathtaking. There are portions where a translation of the Japanese narrative would have been nice, but that is a minor quibble. The video and sound are stellar. The choices are wide-ranging, span the range of emotions and highlight the power music has in complementing storylines as each piece draws memories of the films. The live vocal performances range from good to  tremendous, with Ayaka Hirahara's vocal on pieces from Spirited Away being show-stoppers. While the muric plays a central role, the video holds one's attention and Joe's talents as musician, conductor and composer are righted feted. Te disc is a pricey one, but well worth it as one returns to it again and again. This blu=-ray played in a US-purchased player without incident.",1386892800,4,948,4.888198757763975
3831838,5,B0021D5ET6,"/* A brief description of this product in case you haven't done your own reading or the seller doesn't go into more detail */

This is a Blu-ray release of a concert that maestro Joe Hisaishi (one of the greatest composers of Japanese film music to date, in my opinion) gave with the New Japan Philharmonic (World Dream) Orchestra among a host of other musicians, including several local marching bands and a LOT of choirs. In total there were well over a thousand musicians on stage, performing their very best for an audience of fourteen thousand in the Nippon Budokan, one of the biggest venues in Japan.

This concert celebrates twenty-five years of collaboration between Joe Hisaishi and Hayao Miyazaki and is a jubilee of the music that Hisaishi has composed for an assortment of the Miyazaki films, some of them re-arranged here and there for concert performance. All of these are conducted by Hisaishi himself and performed by the orchestra and a host of talented soloists (some very familiar to the scene, like the concertmaster of the NJ Phil or Hisaishi's daughter Mai). Selections from the films are projected onto the enormous screen that looms over the orchestra to go along with the music. The selections are from ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,"" ""Princess Mononoke,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea"" (and if you sneer at that, I spit in your general direction), ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky,"" ""Porco Rosso"" (only briefly; Joe performs a single piece at the piano with the brass of the NJ Phil), ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" ""Spirited Away,"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro."" After the last of ""Totoro,"" Joe comes back for two encores - ""Madness"" from ""Porco Rosso"" and ""Ashitaka and San"" from ""Princess Mononoke.""

/* Description ends here, and the review begins: */

Well, this is FANTASTIC. You may be put off a bit at the price (but I promise that most Japanese media is just this expensive: if you so wish, cast an eye around your Asian friends and see of they could find cheaper local sources) but when you take the plunge, you won't be sorry, especially not when you listen to this glorious performance, totally immersed in the outstanding visual and audio experience. Joe really knows how to sell a concert: this is just chock-full of his most iconic, most memorable themes ever composed for the cinema. Even the themes from ""Ponyo"" get dressed up for a night at the Proms (you will be absolutely CHARMED by Mai, Joe's daughter, who solos for ""Rondo on the House of Sunflowers,"" a sweet song that precedes the symbolic union of man and nature) - you cannot possibly complain about the oblique composition of ""Nausicaa"" or the sound of the marching band in ""Castle in the Sky;"" it's all there for a reason, and they're all there for the best.

The pieces by themselves, re-arranged to be more complete for the concert setting (film music is sometimes fragmentary, bending itself over backwards to match on-screen events), are fantastic enough - but to be performed by a top-notch orchestra led by the maestro himself just blows the ceiling out. You may already be well-acquainted with many of these themes, but hearing them shaped anew in such skilled hands is really worthwhile. At the same time, this is not just a bland rehashing of things we all know: look no further than the soaring string section bridging the middle of ""Reprise"" (from ""Spirited Away,"" performed here by Ayaka Hirahara) to convince yourself of Hisaishi's skill with re-arranging. Or perhaps debate yourself over sparkling variations that Joe and the NJ Phil merrily march through for the opening theme to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (which eventually turns into a joyous celebration of childhood taken fortissimo), or the contrapuntal rollercoaster ride of the ending theme to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (lots of amazing stringwork there; many kudos to the violins for not tripping up).

There is music for all here, to the exclusion of none: the easy listener may pick out favorites from ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (written in faux-European style, but surprisingly well) or ""Symphonic Variations on the Merry-go-Round of Life"" (from ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" an abridged account of the lush earworm-laden film score) or even ""Ponyo"" (interestingly close-looped and tightly integrated). And even the moderate fan with a passing memory of any of the films will take the rest in stride equally well; the diehard fan like me just collapses with ecstasy at the gorgeous music.

I wholeheartedly recommend this concert for everyone: balk only at the price, and let no other qualms turn you away.",1384128000,35,4586,4.932642487046632

The video quality is gorgeous and the audio is perfect! It's an awesome experience!

8348921,5,B0021D5ET6,"This is a stellar performance. Do not regret the price one bit! Even though it is the most expensive Blurry I have ever purchased. The audio quality is fantastic....though the audience cheers have a strange out of phase or reverb sound to them. And I do wish there was sub titles, there is probably about 5 minutes worth of talking through out the presentation and it would be nice to see what Hisaishi and Miyazaki say to each other :(

Camera work is good, but the video quality it rough. It looks like they used a camera that was not well suited for low light and as a result there is TON of grain in the video.

The song selection is pretty good, though I felt too much emphasis was put on Ponyo (which was new at the time, so it makes sense). I wish they would have done more with Spirited Away though. It was a phenomenal sound track, but only 2 songs were performed from it and both were vocal (though very good sounding, despite me knowing zero Japanese).

I watched this concert on YouTube many times. I finally decided to pay the premium price and get the real deal. I love Joe Hisaishi and support him as much as I can, and I would very much recommend this product.",1454025600,6,1176,4.288288288288288
8348922,5,B0021D5ET6,"It's kind of hard to listen to any of Joe Hisaishi's works and not feel the music pulling at your emotions, from grand symphonic pieces to a few jazzy pieces.  In Budokan features selections from Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, Ponyo, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, Howl's Moving Castle, and My Neighbor Totoro.  It really doesn't say enough, but every track on this disk is gripping and beautiful!  Great music to study with or simply relax!

Considering the size of the setup, I'm amazed at how well synchronized the orchestra, band, and vocalists are.  It's great to see that Joe is enjoying himself throughout the entire performance.

The only nitpick that I have is that the video quality was a little south of my expectations, but it was still very good.

Overall, definitely worth a pick up if you can find a copy!",1441584000,,869,4.71523178807947
