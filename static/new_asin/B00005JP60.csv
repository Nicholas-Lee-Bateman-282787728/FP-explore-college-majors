1557913,4,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is the newest film by Mira Nair who directed Monsoon Wedding and Vanity Fair. The film centers around an Indian family living in New York. The parents Ashoke Ganguli (Irfan Khan) and Ashima Ganguli (Tabu) immigrated to American after their parents arranged to have the couple married. The story begins prior to Ashoke and Ashima's wedding when Ashoke is going to visit his grandfather via a train which ends up in a horrific accident, leaving Ashoke a changed man. For awhile the film focuses on the young couple's life in New York which was obviously a lonely time for Ashima since she did not know anybody in the US. The couple ends up having two children, Gogol and Sonia and they move out into the 'burbs.

When Gogol (Kal Penn) gets older, the adolescent angst kicks in especially during high school when his high school peers teases him for his unusual name. This soon leads to his conflict between his parents' traditional Indian heritage and his Americanized upbringing. For awhile Gogol rebels against his parents' Indian roots but when tragedy befalls the family, his Indian roots is awakened through self-realization.

The film was excellent. The writing was strong and every compelling. The conflict between America and India in Gogol was very convincing. After seeing this film, I am quite interested in reading the book that this film was based on.

Kal Penn is more known for his goofy roles like in National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Harold and Kumar goes to White Castle. I recently saw him on an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit this year in a darker, sinister role. I thought he was quite good as an actor. I hope to see him in roles like Gogol and maybe make less crappy comedy films like Van Wilder.",1174780800,,1744,4.730263157894737
1557914,4,B00005JP60,"""The Namesake"", directed by Mira Nair (""Mississippi Masala"", ""Monsoon Wedding"") and based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, tells the thoughtful, well-told story of a Bengali family's life in New York. The parents move to the country, try to get acclimated, have children and then try to instill traditional values in them as they grow up and deal with their own difficulties. ""The Namesake"" is a very good film, but it lacks just a little something to make it a great film.

Ashoke (Irfan Khan, star of many Bollywood films) meets Ashima (Tabu) in India. Their parents are very keen on their marriage and both consent to become man and wife; Ashoke is clearly taken by Ashima's beauty and Ashima seems to be intrigued with the idea of living in America. Upon their arrival in New York, Ashoke immediately returns to work, leaving his new wife to acclimate to the new, cold weather surroundings alone. Soon, they have a child, Gogol, named after Ashoke's favorite author, Nikolai Gogol. Then, they have a daughter, Sonia. As the children grow, they become more and more entrenched in the American way of life, eschewing many of the parent's traditional beliefs. After graduating from college, Gogol (Kal Penn, ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"", TV's ""24"") announces he wants to change his name, he can't see Gogol Ganguli on a resume getting him a good job. This causes a rift between father and son, causing discord in their relationship.

Directed by Mira Nair, ""The Namesake"" is a beautiful looking, thoughtful film. If Nair is able to accomplish anything, it is to make her films thoughtful examinations of the challenges her characters face in a new environment, or as they strain against old-fashioned ideas and morals. Her films have concentrated primarily on the experience of Indians, both in India and America, throwing her min characters into a new situation, as they face many challenges. In ""The Namesake"", the story centers on the Ganguli family and it is much different than I originally anticipated.

Watching the trailers, you might get the impression the film is primarily about the struggles of Gogol (Penn), as he deals with life as an Indian in the United States. Actually, his story is just a part of the overall film. The film begins in the 70s, as Ashoke travels on a train, reading a collection of works by Nikolai Gogol. Later, he meets Ashima, they marry, move to America, get to know one another, have children, and much more. The film presents a lot of detail about the lives of this family.

In less capable hands, the film would completely succumb to its `melodramatic' structure, but Nair manages to keep these tendencies at bay, for most of the film. The director makes the characters very real, showing them in very natural situations. This is the history of this family, not merely a slice of life. Because of that, we watch various, representative episodes through the years, in an attempt to get a full picture of the Ganguli family.

Irfan Khan has made about forty films, according to IMDB, and this is the first time I have ever seen him on screen. The majority of his work has been in Bollywood, but with this film, he appears to be branching out and has just completed a role in the Anjelina Jolie film about journalist Daniel Pearl and his wife. Khan is really good as Ashoke. He makes the character seem real by imbuing him with feelings and attitudes that seem real. He almost doesn't appear to be acting; he appears to be pulling thoughts and ideas from his real life to make this character seem more realistic. When he is happy, he smiles slightly, when he is upset, his eyes narrow and he stares at the person he is talking to. He isn't effusive, but realizes he has to protect his family and try to live with their mistakes, even if he disagrees.

Tabu is also very good as Ashima, the Ganguli family matriarch. As soon as she arrives in America, she tries to acclimate, on her own, but finds it too much. When Ashoke realizes this, he becomes much more compassionate, maybe even falls in love with her a little more. As she grows older, and her children grow older, she becomes more of a patriarch, more of a guiding force in her children's lives.

Kal Penn is probably the most recognizable face in the cast. He is good, but he is not a great actor. Penn is capable of delivering the emotions necessary to portray Gogol, the young man torn between tradition and his desire to be a modern American, but he only delivers the one emotion, or thought, never making his character seem real. When Gogol is supposed to be sad, Penn frowns. When he is happy, Penn smiles. There is never anything underneath the surface, never a layer of conflict or a layer of any other emotion than the one he is supposed to portray at that given moment. This makes his performance serviceable, but not much else.

Initially, I thought the film would be primarily about Gogol, which would mean a lot of screen time for Penn. I was surprised to find the film is more of a family portrait, charting the course of this family's journey to America and how they deal with all of their problems. This helps the film because it takes the focus off of Penn and let's the other actors, the better actors, contribute to the success of the film. The other actors are better.

Jacinda Barrett (""Poseidon"", ""School for Scoundrels"") appears as Gogol's American girlfriend. And she is also serviceable. It is easy to see why he would be attracted to her, physically, but she is also a little boring. She is always smiling, a little giggly, which fits her character well. But we never really learn anything about her. At one point, Gogol asks her about her dreams and ambitions. Her replay is ""I don't want to think about it now"".

Nair has a real knack for pulling away the layers, allowing her characters to show their feelings in a natural way. Ashoke is a complicated character, and we see that in just about every scene, every conversation, every action. Nair allows the character to retain their Indian roots and heritage, yet deal with life in America. Throughout the film, the family has traditional celebrations, interacts with the Indian community and through these moments, we get a glimpse of this culture. I am not an expert, but because these moments are so thoughtful, and interesting, I have no doubt they are also realistic as well.

""The Namesake"" is a well-made and thoughtful film, but because of the very reasons it is well made, it is less than great. Because the film covers so much territory, it seems slightly melodramatic, cutting through the film's power like a knife to butter. The scenes are well done and get the message across, but they give the film an episodic structure. There is an overall theme to the film, Gogol accepting his heritage and identity, and there is another layer below that, which I won't reveal, but because the scenes are episodic, they don't allow the story to generate any heat or power, to make it resonate with the viewer. The final moments will move you, I just wish there were more moments like this throughout the film.

As you watch, you will become engrossed in the lives of these characters, then the story shifts, and you have to become familiar with them again, at this new point in their lives. This isn't bad, but these scenes don't always grab us, and demand our attention. After a while, they become a little routine and our attention shifts.

""The Namesake"" is a well-made film, worth your attention, but it is not an incredible film, or a memorable film. You will likely only remember it when you hear about Mira Nair's next film.",1174780800,4,7636,4.68530947054437
1557915,5,B00005JP60,"This movie is OSCAR Stuff...profound, deeply engrossing, the split personae of first generation immigrants to the nation of Nations, that is, America...the true process of melding of cultures in the mind...the multi-mirrored facets of an immigrant whose roots have been uprooted, but still coping with and, growing new-roots, and fresh growth again...humanly painted in pictures with limited words, but speaking volumes at the same time....",1174435200,3,440,5.7846153846153845
1557916,5,B00005JP60,"Meticulously observed and wonderfully heartfelt, this time-spanning 2007 family dramedy represents a return to form for director Mira Nair, who faltered somewhat with 2004's elaborate but lugubrious ""Vanity Fair"". This one is also a literary adaptation but this time from a contemporary best-seller by Jhumpa Lahiri, who wrote an emotionally drawn story about first generation Bengali immigrants to the United States and their U.S.-born children. It's an intricate book full of careful nuances, and Nair, along with screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala, captures most of them in a most loving manner. The story speaks fluently to the universal struggle to extricate ourselves from the obligation of family and a perceived enslavement to the past. Nair and Taraporevala manage to transcend the necessarily episodic nature of the novel to make it an involving journey toward self-acceptance.

The film initially focuses on Ashoke Ganguli and his arranged marriage to Ashima, a classically trained singer. The young couple move from Calcutta in 1977 to Queens in order for him to pursue his career as an electrical engineer. The adjustment is difficult, especially for Ashima in assimilating into the often cold U.S. culture, and these quiet scenes show a keen eye for subtle observation. They quickly have two children in succession, son Gogol and daughter Sonia. Gogol's name is the key plot point as he was inadvertently after Ashoke's favorite writer, Nikholai Gogol, and this is revealed to have greater significance as the story unfolds. Eventually, the film switches the perspective to Gogol's as he grows up, changes his name to Nikhil and starts his life as a yuppie architect in Manhattan.

At the same, the film does not abandon Ashoke and Ashima as they remain significant figures in shaping Gogol's destiny, especially as the impact of a tragic turn brings unexpected changes. The cathartic aspect of these scenes is what makes the film powerful. Moreover, with her filmmaking experience in her native India and the U.S., Nair brings a seamless fluency to both locales. The movie falters a bit toward the end when it starts to ramble and feel pat, but the story's old world gravitas rescues it just in time. Beforehand I was convinced Kal Penn would be the spoiler in this film, but he gives a sharp, dedicated performance as Gogol. Poised to be taken seriously as an actor even amid his White Castle and Van Wilder movies, he seems a bit exaggerated only in the early teenage scenes which recall those other movies.

However, it is the superb work of Irfan Khan and Tabu as his parents that make the film soar. Both bring a level of assurance and compassion that ground the film completely, especially Tabu who makes the seemingly modest character arc of Ashima really striking. Playing yet another variation of the spoiled American girl, Jacinda Barrett again proves how fearless an actress she can be in exposing the vanity and ignorance of Maxine, Gogol's first serious girlfriend. As Moushumi, the Bengali girl who comes with the family's seal of approval, Zuleikha Robinson has a ripe presence to match her character's aspiring worldliness. Cinematographer Frederick Elmes and production designer Stephanie Carroll provide masterful work in capturing the diverse flavors of the different locales. This film is for anyone who has struggled to forge his or her own identity only to find the need to embrace the past, especially those of us who have parents who displayed the courage to move from their native lands.",1173484800,26,3524,5.13588850174216
1558055,4,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is about a young man, Gogol, who struggles between the life that he knows and his roots. Gogol was born in America but his parents labor to show him the ways and traditions of India. Throughout his young life he misses the lessons that are taught to him by his parents. Unfortunately, its not until the death of his father that he realizes the things that they were trying to teach him.
At times, Gogol seems, for a lack of a better word, ashamed of his heritage. He indulges in articles of an American teenage boy, ie., girls, parties, marijuana, etc. But is never overtaken by it. While on family vacation in India, he visits the Taj Mahal and decides that he wants a career in architecture. While in college he meets, and falls in love with, an American girl who occupies most of his time when not attending class. When Gogol finally takes the young woman to meet his parents, they are taken aback by her aboveboard attitude. The look on their faces when she addresses them by their first names is hilarious.

The backdrop of this film is the Hindu religion. Beautiful Hindu weddings are displayed, as well as, a Hindu ceremony to commemorate the life of Gogols father. The attitude of the Hindu women in this film seem unassuming and meek. They wear beautiful sari dresses and those red dots in the center of their foreheads called Bindu. These Bindu symbolize the third eye of spiritual sight. They also wore artistic Mehndi (Henna) tattoos on their arms, hands, and feet. Im not quite sure the significance of this art.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film. Growing up in America, Ive learned to appreciate horror, and violent in a movie, but The Namesake has intrigued me to want to see other independent films. I give it 4/5 stars.",1510185600,,1752,4.612179487179487

It shows intense scenes of cultural displacement and alienation. Provided the insight of how difficult it would have been to live in a country that doesnt share your same personal beliefs.

After moving from Calcutta to New York, members of the Ganguli family maintain a delicate balancing act between honoring the traditions of their native India and blending into American culture. Although parents Ashoke and Ashima are proud of the sacrifices they make to give their offspring opportunities, their son Gogol strives to forge his own identity without forgetting his heritage. However, several years on, Gogol decides he wants to be called Nick when he begins to show little interest in his heritage and becomes more thoroughly with Americanized teenager.

The Namesake
Plot Summary:
 The movie opens when Ashoke is younger and he is traveling on a train. While reading a book by Nikolai Gogol, the train crashes, and he is the sole survivor. The set changes to Ashoke meeting Ashima for the first time. They have an arranged marriage and move to New York from India. They start a family and name their first child Gogol, and their second is Sonia. They change Gogols name to Nikhil but he wants to be called Gogol still. He starts hating his name in high school when he learns about who Nikolai Gogol was. When Gogol graduates, their family takes a trip to India. When they move back home, Gogol tells his parents that he wants to change his name to Nikolai, which upsets his father. He starts going by Nick, and dates a Caucasian girl named Maxine. Gogols father, Ashoke, tells him why he was named Gogol, and how it traces back to the train wreck when he was going to visit his grandfather. While away on business, Ashoke dies of a heart attack and Gogol has to identify the body. The family travels to India for the ceremony and scatters Ashokes ashes in the Ganges. Ashima tells Gogol to make up with Maxine, but he ends up going on a blind date and falling in love with a girl he had met once before. They get married, but on their first anniversary, they have a big argument. Meanwhile, Ashima decides to move back to India and spend six months of every year in America. Gogols wife has an affair, so she and Gogol go their separate ways. When Ashima sells the house, Gogol finds the book by Nikolai Gogol that his father had given him on his graduation day, and he decides to travel the world. Sonia has found the love of her life, and Ashima moves back to India to continue singing.

How it relates to World Religions:
 I noticed several connections to Hinduism, but also some that I am not sure if it is Indian culture, or the religion of Hinduism. At the very beginning of the movie, they are singing and worshipping a deity. I also saw many deities shown throughout the movie. The culture in India is obviously different. When Ashima and Ashoke meet, neither one of them looks at the other, and Ashima looks at the ground for the majority of her poem recitation. When the family is in India, I saw an ascetic roaming the streets. When Gogol goes to see his parents, he has to tell his girlfriend no kissing or touching because that is not appropriate in his culture. When Ashoke dies, Ashima wipes away her Bindi and Gogol shaves his head. During Ashokes funeral-type ceremony, Gogol reminds me of a Brahmin. The last and biggest connection to Hinduism was the final Deity I saw. I believe it was Saraswati because of the instrument she was holding.",1507334400,,2714,4.456740442655936

1558119,4,B00005JP60,"Adjusting to modern life in the West is difficult, especially for those with vastly different ways of life. This is one of many themes presented in the movie The Namesake, which explores a multitude of conflicts including what it means to be free. This movie is wonderfully directed and a great adaptation from its novel counterpart. It captures many themes and emotions that characterize immigration to the United States. The story is about a girl called Ashima who is an aspiring singer and a male student from abroad (Ashoke) who is a victim of a tragic train crash. They marry and move from India to the US, where they begin a new life. They have two children, a boy called Gogol and a girl called Sonia. The movie follows this family as they assimilate to the new culture and learn about their new found freedom, which also causes a multitude of heartbreaks and pain along the way.
 This movie captures the essence of living in a foreign land spectacularly, especially with how it relates to religious and cultural diversity. The family, a culturally bound Hindi group, struggles with the independence allowed to their family, specifically Sonia. Her Hindi family members from India visit, only to comment about when she will settle down and have children. This clash of cultural and religious values causes stress in the family, ultimately causing them to divide and go their own separate ways in the end. Some find strength in independence, while others find reconciliation with their Indian roots. In the end, The Namesake is a beautifully crafted character story that creates a whirlwind of emotions that will keep you engrossed in its story and world for every moment. This movie masterfully integrates religious themes, cultural commentary, and inner conflict in a story that works well 11 years after its release.",1491177600,,1825,4.9640522875816995

His parents were married in India before coming to America where his father was attending college. When he was born, his father gave him his pet name, Gogul, which would eventually become his good name. His name held a great depth of meaning for his father. Upon his graduation, Ashoke gave his son a book by Nikolai Gogul, Nick's namesake. Upon a trip to India, Nick finds what he wants to do with his life, and one can glimpse into his views of the world and society. While attending college, he begins dating a girl who is not Bengali. His mother disapproves of this, yet she makes no attempt to protest it. However, his outlook on life and his heritage changes upon the passing of his father, and he embarks on a journey to discover who he really is and what he truly wants. He eventually rediscovers the book by Nikolai Gogul, and he starts to feel that he is no longer burdened by his name or heritage and truly feels free.

Near the beginning of the movie, you see a marriage interview taking place between Ashima's and Ashoke's parents. Indian people have two names. One is a pet name called Daknam, the other is a good name called Bhalonam. When Sonia is born, a ceremony is performed that is supposed to determine her future. When Ashoke dies, Nick shaves his head and attends a mourning ceremony. The father was cremated, and the immediate family travels to India to scatter Ashokes ashes into the river. You also see two ceremonies similar to that of a wedding. the first takes place between Ashoke and Ashima. The other is the union of Nick and Moushima.",1478995200,,1713,4.543689320388349

The movie starts by showing a train wreck which will later have impact on the rest of the story.
Ashoke and Ashima are two young Bengali Indians who have an arranged marriage. After being married, Ashoke takes his young bride to live with him in New York. Ashoke has already been living in the United States for some time and has adapted to the American lifestyle so he tries to explain how things are different in the United States to his new bride. Ashima adapts to her new lifestyle although it is difficult and lonely at times. Soon she is expecting her first child. When the baby is born, they decide to call him Gogul as a nickname and later decide that his good name will be Nikhil.  Ashima later gives birth to a daughter, Sonia.
When it is time for Nikhil to go to school, he tells his teacher that he would prefer to be called Gogul which secretly makes his father proud. Ashima on the other hand is shocked that children have so much say so in the United States. When Gogul is in high school he informs his parents that he would like to change his name back to Nikhil. Gogul is now a rebellious teenager who is smoking marijuana and trying to distance himself as far away as he can from his Indian roots. Sonia is also a rebellious teen who also feels distant from her Indian roots. After Nikhil graduates from high school, he and the entire family go to India for the summer to visit family. Both Nikhil and Sonia have a hard time adapting to the Indian lifestyle. Before returning to America, the family takes a trip to the Taj Mahal, this inspires Nikhil to want to become an architect.
Nikhil moves out of his parents home to attend Yale and goes on to meet Maxine, a blonde haired American girl who comes from a wealthy family. Nikhil becomes close to Maxines family, thus distancing himself from his own. Ashoke is to leave to teach at a University in Ohio for 6 months so Ashima requests that Nikhil come for a visit before his father leaves for his trip. Initially Nikhil declines stating that he is going on a trip with Maxines family. Upset by this, Ashima hangs up the phone. Feeling bad, Nikhil and Maxine go to visit his parents. Nikhil explains to Maxine that they should hold hands, kiss or be affectionate in front of his parents as that isn't part of their culture. Ashima and Ashoke are taken back as to how Maxine gives hugs and kisses them on the cheek during their first visit. During this visit Ashoke asks Nikhil to go get ice cream with him. This is when he explains to Nikhil how he got the name Gogul. He tells Nikhil the story of the train wreck stating that he was reading a book by Nikolai Gogul at the time of the accident and that there were no other survivors found. He also told him about the passenger who was in front of him telling him that he should travel the world and how that man didn't survive. Nikhil asks his father if he reminds him of that day and Ashoke tell him that he reminds him of everything good that came after. As Maxine and Gogul are leaving for their weekend trip, Ashima asks Nikhil to call to let them know that they have arrived safely. A disappointed Ashima who is waiting by the phone tells Ashoke that he never called.
Ashoke leave for Ohio to teach at the university. Ashima is now alone at home and feels lonely. She tries to call Gogul for his birthday however he doesnt answer his phone and when she tries to call information to get Maxine parents telephone number, it is unlisted. Again a sad Ashima hangs up the phone as she quietly wishes her son happy birthday to an empty telephone line. Ashoke calls Ashima on the telephone stating that he is suffering with a stomach and that he has gone to the local hospital to seek medical attention. Hours pass by and Ashima still has not heard from Ashoke so finally she calls the hospital to see if she can get some information. After spelling her name for the nurse multiple times and being transferred from person to person, a nurse gets on the line and tells her that Ashoke has passed away from a massive heart attack. Ashima is in shock and hangs up the phone. Nikhil who is spending time with Maxine get a message from Maxines father that his mother has tried to call him twice. Nikhil states that he would call her in the morning, however Sonia calls Nikhil to inform him that his father has passed away.
Nikhil travels to Ohio to identify his father and to bring his body home to be cremated. A grieving Nikhil stays with his mother to perform his fathers funeral. Maxine shows up to the ceremony wearing a black dress where everyone is wearing white. She tries to convince Nikhil that they should still go on the trip that they have planned during New Years and states that he cant stay with his mother forever. Nikhil is clearly upset at her lack of understanding his culture and basically ends their relationship.
After the family return from India following the scattering of Ashokes remains in the Ganger River, Ashima tells Gogul (Nikhil) that a family friends daughter, Moushumi is back in NY and to call her for tea. Gogul had previously met this girl and didn't like her but to please his mother Gogul says that he would call her for tea. Gogul is pleasantly surprised when he meets Moushumi, she is beautiful and actually speaks to him this time. The two arrange to see each other again and develop a relationship. After some time Gogul and Moushumi get married.
Gogul and Moushumi are having some marital problems because Gogul wants to be a proper family while Moushumi wants to be surrounded by friends. After attending a party when Moushumi announces that Nikhil changed his name from Gogul to her friends, he gets upset because of the meaning behind the name Gogul. After arriving home, Moushumi shows Nikhil a letter that she has been offered to tech in France, however she turned the job down stating that she would be a good Bengali wife and cook samosas every Thursday. Moushumi feeling that this isn't the; life she wants to read pulls out a book from Pierre and thus begins to have an affair.
Ashima makes the decision that she would like to return to America and decides to have the family over so that she can make the announcement. While preparing dinner Ashima overhears a telephone call between Moushumi and Pierre (Ashima knows that it isn't Nikhil on the other end of the call).  Ashima makes the announcement at dinner and states that she will put the house up for sale. Ashima soon gets an offer on the house and decides that she will make everything final after Christmas. Ashima decides to have one last get together at her home before she returns to India, she thanks everyone for being there for her and for the memories. After the party stars to dwindle Ashima goes to find Nikhil in his old bedroom where he is reading a book by Nikolai Gogul which his father gave to him as a High School graduation present. Ashima ask Nikhil about Moushumi and he tells his mother about the affair.
As the movie ends, Ashima is shown teaching classical music (this is what she did before coming to the US) and shows Gogul (Nikhil) focuses on re staring his life.
This movie shows many Indian customs right from the beginnings of the movie. It shows arranged marriage, the traditional baby naming process, the ceremony for when the baby turns one. It also shows a traditional Bengali wedding as well a traditional funeral. By doing this, it allows viewers to have a deeper look into some of the traditions and customs of a different culture and allows us to see the differences. What I really loved about this movie is the fact that it gave cultural insight on almost every important function in ones life from marriage all the way to death. All in all I would have to say that this is a fantastic movie.",1473638400,,7770,4.486581920903955

The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because there are only three movies (Citizen Kane, La Dolce Vita, Black Orpheus) that will ever get so many stars from my point of view and because there are a couple of scenes that drag and add very little to the story.

1558308,5,B00005JP60,"In the Namesake, it portrays two different cultures, Indian and the American Culture.  Two generations of a Bengali family that with their traditions, they are involved in an arranged marriage.  The family moves to New York from Calcutta to embark on a journey of experiencing a different culture that they have never known.  They have two children. The story then shifts to focus on their son, Gogul. He is very disinterested in their culture and abiding in his family tradition. Gogul and his sister sometimes resent and make fun of their parents tradition. This movie actually portrays being Indian and American at the same time. The familys son meets a young girl, which is American and not of their culture. The Indian culture has many traditions, such as no kissing and no touching.  This really shows the culture gap when he explains to her that none of this is welcomed in front of his parents. This movie really represents how different cultures believe and how they are so different and what takes place with interactions from someone out of your culture.  This is a great movie, one culture merging with another and their differences, arranged marriages, adultery, discrimination, and self-identity.

I believe this movie sheds much light on the Indian culture and may help you to understand the culture. There are great actors chosen that really tell the story as if you lived it yourself or were actually there. This is a must see movie that will help you understand how it seems that two worlds can collide and then find common ground.  Being raised by one culture and then thrust your children into another can seem to be rather challenging. Family tradition is always great, but you wonder does it take the children out of the traditions, when they are trying to live in two different cultures at the same time.

1558421,3,B00005JP60,"The movie the Namesake, is based on a Bengali couple who were both born in India and moved to the United States. Asoka, the father in the movie, was in a terrible train wreck, after he healed he moved to the United States to pursue his educated. He then returned to India where he had an arranged marriage to Ashima. They moved to the US and had their first child, who was named Gogol; this was meant to be his temporary name while they awaited the grandmothers given name. However, Gogol wanted to keep his name once he entered school. The name had a special meaning to his father, as this was the authors name of the book he was reading went he was in his accident. Ashima gave birth to Gogols sister went he was about 5 years of age. The movie fast tracks to Gogol being in high school; this is went he first learned about the nature of the author by which is name was chosen. After high school he goes to Yale where he is in a relationship with a westerner. During his teen and college years Gogol did not spend much time with his parents, who lived more by their eastern culture. Gogols fathers dies and he began to see that he had been neglecting his culture and family. He ended up marrying a young Bengali woman he, when this did not work out he tells his mother he feels free for the first time; this was after he found a book that his father gave him back in high school, by Nicolai Gogol, his Namesake.
 There are some cultural and symbols, from the movie Namesake, which I recognize while studying World Religion. In Hinduism, women played more of a role of being a homemaker and caring for the family and their husbands, just as Ashima played this role. She wore a red dot on her head while she was married to Asoka, which is a symbol for a married woman; whereas; a black dot represents when someone is single. The symbol can also be a representation for the god Shiva. Today, these dots are more worn for a fashion statement. A few of the ceremonial events from the movie included marriages, when Asoka dies, and the ceremony for Gogol sister Sonia when she was a baby. In all the events they were adorned in native clothing. Also, throughout the movie Ashima, and other Bengali women, always wore their clothing from their country and never wore American clothing. The children wore American clothing mainly throughout the film.
The film is good for someone to relate what it is like for parents coming from another culture and raising their children in a Western world and it makes you pay attention to the cultural differences.",1447545600,,2545,4.438034188034188
1558422,4,B00005JP60,"I really enjoyed The Namesake. It portrays a Hindu familys reality in America. The film follows two generations of a Bengali Brahmin family, the Gangulis. The parents, Ashoke and Ashima came to New York City from India after an arranged marriage to experience a world of limitless opportunities. They are confronted with the perils and confusions of trying to build a meaningful new life in a baffling new society. They fall in love and acclimate, but still retain their Indian customs, beliefs, and traditions. Gogol is their first-born child. He has a younger sister, Sonia. Both are American-born. The story shifts between the U.S. and India. It shows Gogols cross-cultural experiences and his exploration of his Indian heritage. It depicts Gogol as a lazy, pot-smoking, rock n-roll loving teen who is indifferent to his background. He doesnt understand his parents, and he resents his family traditions and customs. Gogol starts opening up to his culture after visiting India before starting college at Yale. He is caught between two conflicting cultures with highly distinct religious, social and ideological differences. Cultural tensions flare when he brings home his rich, white girlfriend from college, and they are expected to withhold any expressions of physical affection, which is Indian tradition. Gogols father, Ashoke, dies of a heart attack while Gogol is on vacation with his girlfriends family, whom he feels closer to than his own family. Grieving, Gogol tries to be like what he thinks his parents want him to be. He begins following Indian customs more closely, and breaks up with his girlfriend. He marries Moushumi, the daughter of Indian family friends. Moushumi has an affair with an old boyfriend, and Gogol divorces her. Gogol then finds a book at his mothers home that his father had given him for graduation. Gogol reads the stories written by his namesake. Previously, his father miraculously survived a train crash while reading a Gogol story. The book becomes a symbolic tie to his homeland, and an omen of good luck. Before receiving the book, as Gogul grows up, he embraces, then rejects his name. This becomes a metaphor for his divided cultural identity. The name holds deep meaning for the father, but his son carries it as a burden until his father reveals from where it came. As Gogul struggles with Hindu roots and his American birthright in the search for his own identity, he attempts to forge his destiny, all while his parents cling to their Bengali Hindu traditions. Gogol begins to see the links between the world his parents left behind and the new world in front of him. The movie does a great job portraying what so many immigrants and first-generation American-born children of immigrants face. There are a lot of tensions, but also reassuring faith in family solidarity. Ashoke and Ashima are tolerant and devoted parents their children cherish, even though the children reject the old ways.",1447545600,,2943,5.070103092783505

1558569,5,B00005JP60,"Kal Penn plays the Bengali American son, Gogol, from Nyack, New York. His parents were both Bengali Asian Indian who married in Calcutta, India and relocate to Queens, New York and later Nyack, New York. When he was born, this hospital insisted on a name where his father chose Gogol until the Grandmother sent a name in a letter by post. It is set in the late seventies.

Gogol grows up, graduates high school, and Yale. He changes his name to Nick in college. He becomes assimilated and Americanized with a Waspy girlfriend named Maxine.

Everything changed when his father dies suddenly. The Indian actor and actress who play Gogol's parents are just award winning in their roles. I was watching the film and stunned by such loss. This is great film-making by Mira Nair, An Indian American female director. She did a fantastic job.

I enjoyed seeing Calcutta, the Taj Mahal, New York City, and Nyack, New York. The actors all did Oscar caliber performances. The art direction is perfect. The film captures the Asian Indian American experience perfectly. Even though I'm not Asian Indian, I have Asian Indian friends, colleagues, and more. Since I lived in Central Jersey, I've had more exposure than most in America. Kal Penn grew up twenty minutes south of me.

Even if you don't understand, the film does a beautiful job weaving Asian Indians in diaspora and their connections to culture and family. The DVD includes deleted scenes; a 30 minute interview with director Mira Nair at Columbia University Graduate Film School; Fox Movie Channel presents in character with Kal Penn; Kolkata love poem featureette; and photography as inspiration feature.",1435795200,,1654,4.96028880866426

1558930,3,B00005JP60,"My opinion of the movie is unfortunately and unalterably at the mercy of having read the novel, which I'll have to say left a very profound impression on me. In the movie's favour, there is a great deal of very effective and touching setting up of scenes that say, ""Here you are, in a very liveley at-home-and-abroad West Bengali  universe."" However one rarely gets close enough to most of the main characters, especially Gogol/Nikhil to get a real sense of their dilemmas. Much less does the movie make clear what factors are at the heart of the vicissitudes of the protagonist's relationships. Most of the ""manufactured"" motivations concocted to explain many of the life-decisions depicted are simply not adequate to their purpose. The narrative thread seemed unnecessarily disjointed and precipitous, especially considering the complicated and yet very carefully and unambiguously executed flow of the narrative in the novel.  Except for at least one character whom I felt may have been miscast, the acting is very affecting and certainly the cast as given would have been up to a more rigorous effort at telling the story of this young man and his family. This may have been one of those rare cases where risking some complaints by letting the film run a little longer, might have left a little more room to acknowledge and savor the many narrative turns.",1417392000,,1359,4.956140350877193

By Amazon Customer:  The NAMESAKE

Mira Nairs version of The Namesake was brilliantly made, it showed how a name is more than a name it is a name made from richness to describe a person for their integrity.  The character Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli never made their lives different from others, even through the hard times.  Their love was based on a triumph of trust and belief not to defer their Indian heritage, their son Kal Penn  played the role of Nikolai Gogol his character was astoundingly amazing.  Nevertheless, he fails to understand his name until the end.  Gogol needed guidance but refused his teachings, he was filled with a belief to follow his heritage and after several attempts of succeeding, and Gogol finally found freedom from self.  He thought trying to be like his parents his life would be the same as theirs, but found no happiness in relationships, Maxine and Moushumi, hesitant and guarded by his belief Gogol became the man his mother and father wanted only after his fathers death.  This movie was an inspirational tale that was satisfying to all who believe in love, culture, and faith. I give this 4 stars for identity, culture and diversity.

World Religion

The religion Hinduism believes a variety of sects that share common traits such as continuity and a dynamic change for a diverse system.  They offer one path to enlightenment and liberation as to what happens when you die.  They have one God and are grounded in the universe as the Divine Self it is defined by a relationship to the world, yet they have limited attributes of the physical body and is obscured by the minds imperfections. Most Hindu believe that washing away ones transgressions will rid them of their sins, however several challenges continue to exist throughout history today, mostly in the global religion hindus continue to adapt, grow, and change under all types of circumstances.",1397347200,,1916,4.858461538461539

Also, after the wedding how Ashima, the newly wed wife had to move to the United States to accompany her husband in his home.  The scene of how the funeral and bereavement period was carried out was fairly accurate.  The fathers body was cremated and friends and family of the deceased huddled together in his house.  After the death of Gogol's father, he then seemed more interested in his heritage and walking in his place; he shaved his head and began wearing the white robes.  This reminded me of how one seeks dharma. The entire movie is based off of the son Gogol being named after an author of a book, who writes about life and his struggle with living in America and succumbing to his heritage.  A lot of Hinduism is focused on writings and poetry, such as Mahabharata.  Just as with writings in Hindu, people seek to find dharma or a sense of life by wisdom and folktales.  The same happened for Gogol in the end he achieved a sense of peace and freedom and the movie ends with him reading the book his father had given him.  To me that exemplifies him accepting his calling.",1397347200,,1275,4.528384279475983

1559198,3,B00005JP60,"The Namesake really can't be squeezed into a 90 minute film, but this effort does a worthy job.  Much of the energy, friction, tension of the story focuses on the conflicts that arise when persons from a distant culture emigrate to the USA.  They are torn between the desire to adapt to a new culture and the need to maintain their ancestral identity as Bengalis half a world away.

A university professor seeking opportunity in a new country, a wife yearning for the traditions of Bengal, and two thoroughly Americanized children annoyed with a culture they don't really understand.

1559202,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake
  A Plot Summary

 The Namesake begins with a bang. Literally the opening scenes are of a young Indian man named Ashoke riding a train through India on his way to visit his grandfather. He is preoccupied with a book written by the Russian author, Nikolai Gogol, and half-hardheartedly joins a stranger in conversation. This scene ends with a terrible train wreck, and moves to a different character. Highlighting some of her daily events, the scene progression follows Ashima as she makes her way home, where she is to meet a possible suitor for marriage, an Indian tradition. The man just so happens to be Ashoke, and for lack of a better suitor, Ashima says yes. This marriage results in Ashima having to move to the U.S.A. were Ashoke is studying abroad. Its tough on her at first, and the early times had much in line with the classic immigrant-assimilation story.
 Not long after settling down in their tiny flat in the cold, busy New York of 1977, Ashiba gives birth to the main character of the movie. In order to take the baby home, they were required to give a name to put on the birth certificate. This would be contrary to Indian tradition, so Ashoke had the idea of giving him a sort of nick name that they could change later. In honor of his favorite author, he named the boy Gogoli. This is an important occurrence, as it shapes the rest of Gogolis life. Soon it came time for young Gogoli to attend school, his parents decided to give him his good name (also Indian tradtion) which was Nikil. To their surprise Gogoli came home with a note from the teacher saying he wished to be called Gogoli instead. So be it!
 As this was an unusual name, Gogoli found himself continually being picked on. It annoyed him, and his younger sister Sonia did nothing to ease his pain by calling him Goggles. This annoyance resulted in Gogoli attempting to become as Americanized as possible, and to do that he rejected his heritage and traditions. A trip to India with his family gave him more sympathy for his culture, as well as giving him the desire to become an architect. He went to college and took on the name Nick, and so began his new lifestyle. Rejecting his heritage and traditions meant he rejected his family, and while on a vacation with his girlfriend Maxine, his father dies. This strikes a critical blow on Gogoli; as well as beginning a change in who he was to become. While visiting his family during the sad days following, he began a new chapter in his life, and began searching for who he really was.
 With Maxine now out of his life, it was not long before a new girl filled her place. An Indian girl named Moushumi of who Gogolis mother had wanted him to marry. They married in the traditional Indian manner, and all seemed good. However, because Moushumi had embraced western culture so tightly, it was not long until she felt trapped by the old traditions, and so began the affair with a Frenchman that eventually ended their relationship.
 Ashima, now 45, desired to return to India, and announced that she was selling the house to return to her home. After being informed by Gogoli that his relationship was over, she hesitated. Gogoli insisted that she go, by telling her that the ending of his relationship had left him with new feelings of freedom he had never known before. The movie closes with first a scene showing Ashima happily singing at a temple in India, and finally with Gogoli reading the book by Nikolai Gogol that his father had given him, on a train, ready to explore the world

  In Relation to the World Religions Textbook

 This movie relates to our World Religions textbook Hinduism chapter in many ways. First of all, it begins in India, the home of Hinduism. Second, it gives direct insight into Hindu/Indian culture by showing various scenes of people performing Hindu activities, such as carrying statues of Hindu gods, or by joining the family in scenes of classic Hindu tradition. The earliest scenes involving Ashima show her singing Hindu mantras, she returns to her house for a Hindu marriage proposal between her parents and the parents of Ashoka. Everyone is dressed in classic Hindu attire, and the women all have dots on their faces. Portraits of Hindu gods hang on the walls, and everybody seems to eat fruit, in respect of animals.
 The marriage of Ashima and Ashoka seems to have come straight out of the textbook. I guess one could call it a textbook marriage. Everybody was chanting mantras and their marriage was blessed in Hindu fashion. There were many rites and Hindu symbolisms performed. The birth of Gogoli results in a break from Hinduism, but highlights things discussed in the textbook. They were forced to give Gogoli a name right away, rather than later after the family had time to think of a name. As the movie continues on throughout the aging of Gogoli, there are many times were Hinduism can be seen in Gogolis family.
 At the death of Ashoka, the Hindu traditions of mourning occurred. Family and friends joined Ashima and her family in mourning. Ashima wiped away the dot on her forehead indicating marriage, and she resolved to release the ashes of Ashoka into the river Ganges, as according to Hindu tradition. This means a trip to India, were more mourning occurs, much lamp waving and mantra reciting with the family, and then the Hindu ceremony at the river followed by the dumping of the ashes. Gogoli marries a Hindu woman, like his mother wanted, but that doesnt work out so he sets off to discover his own ties to Hinduism. The movie relates to our textbook in many ways, and without having read the textbook chapter on Hinduism, I would have been completely disoriented watching The Namesake.",1391731200,,5699,4.673652694610778

So I watched The Namesake in normal definition and the sound was barely audible through the entire film! It was turned up to the maximum loudness on the sound bar below the film and my computer also had the sound set to the loudest. It made no difference. I had to turn on the closed captions to read the dialogue. I already wrote to you about this problem. Please cancel my order for the HD version. I did not watch it.

I also have bought a few streaming episodes of Downton Abbey. I also has sound problems sporadically with a couple of the episodes. Please cancel my order for the episodes I have not yet watched and refund my account for the cost. Thank you.

1559282,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is an engaging movie that delves into a multi-generational familys story that begins with a tragic accident that leads to a newly married Indian couple moving to America and deciding to start their family there. While parents Ashoke (played soulfully by Irrfan Khan) and Ashima (portrayed effectively by Tabu) must navigate a new country as first-generation immigrants, their children face the challenge of growing up American while being raised Indian at home. Their first-born is a son named Gogol and soon a daughter named Sonia followed. Ashoke and Ashima try hard to make sure their children feel accepted in American society while still instilling their Indian values. Despite being a very close and loving family, a graduating Gogol (played by the talented Kal Penn) finds himself frustrated with his un-American name and is determined to leave it and his culture behind as he moves on to college and his adult life. Gogol (now going by Nick) falls in love with the blonde and very American Maxine and while he spends a lot of time with her family, he avoids his own as much as possible. Ashima guilts Gogol into returning home to visit before his father leaves for a six-month teaching position. Wanting Gogol to be happy, but trying to stop him from completely letting go of his heritage, Ashoke makes the decision to finally tell Gogol the story of his name. The story and a fateful turn of events leads Gogol and his family to finally reconcile their individual issues in order to accept the parts of their cultural identity they have been denying.

Even though The Namesake is about an Indian familys journey to find harmony with American culture, its theme is universal and speaks to anyone who has had a strong religious or cultural upbringing that finds themselves distanced from it whether by choice or circumstance. Many young adults are just like Gogol, torn between their traditional upbringing and the modern world. The values of their parents may not fit into what they want to experience for themselves. Then there are the times when the demands of contemporary life make can make you long for the comforts of home and tradition. With the internet opening up our ability to communicate worldwide and more ideas shared through it, younger generations find themselves more accepting of different religions and lifestyles because they may be more educated than past generations or realize some of the prejudices against a religion or culture is unwarranted. In addition, like Ashoke and Ashima, many parents find themselves sacrificing what is important to them in order to provide their children with a better life. It can be as simple as parents moving from the neighborhood they grew up in because they want to put their child in a better school. Or it could be as major as moving across the world to a place with traditions and a religion totally different from theirs so their children have more opportunities.",1384560000,,2947,4.941532258064516

1559356,4,B00005JP60,"I highly recommend watching the movie The Namesake. The premise of the story is about an Indian family of four living in America. The story begins when the father (Ashoke Ganguli) is a young man on a train ride in Calcutta in 1971. Having a discussion with an older man, he learns about America ""the Land of Opportunity"". Flash forward a short time later, to his somewhat arranged marriage to an Indian woman, Ashima. Following their wedding ceremony they travel back to America, where they relocate to the New York, where Ashoke is a professor. Here Ashima learns about her new home, new husband, and new way of life. She learns to adjust to all the nuances that she is forced to embrace, while still desperately missing her homeland of India. The couple's love grows for each other and they have two children, a boy (Gogol) and a girl (Sonia). The movie follows their lives (particularly Gogol's) over many years and how they balance their Americanized lifestyles with their Indian roots.
The movie demonstrates the vast differences between both American and Indian culture. It includes not only the religious differences, but also the dynamics between the parent/child relationships, especially the relationship between Gogol and Ashima. There is a wedding ceremony and a memorial service that you witness that is very different from what is commonly seen in the United States. While watching the film, one is able to see the importance of family and tradition in the Indian culture. During the movie, Ashoke experiences flashbacks to the opening scene that winds up leaving a lasting impression on both him and his son, Gogol.
It also focuses on the struggle that Gogol (also known as ""Nick"" to his American friends) has with his family background and his ""namesake"". It takes a certain event in the movie for him to realize the importance behind his name as well as his culture, religious background, and above all his family.
If a film about family, tradition and values, along with struggles and hardships, is what you are looking to watch, then I would definitely pick this movie up. You surely will not be disappointed.",1370563200,,2128,4.913888888888889

It is also about migration, raising family and developing a life that at birth was not imagined and a return to what is important and it is not necessarily money, fame and finding your soul partner in serial episodes. It also effectively tells the story of the intergenerational children caught between old/new and making sense and finding place in their own world.

1559433,5,B00005JP60,"In the Hindu way of life there are rituals from the cradle to the cremation ground. According to Mary Fisher, Living Religions, there are sixteen rites prescribed in the ancient scriptures to purify and sanctify the person in his journey of life. The movie Namesake is Gogol's journey through his life. Some of the Hindu rites include the braiding of the pregnant mother's hair, birth, name-giving, starting education, first leaving home, marriage and death. Many of the sixteen rites can be found in this movie. From arranged marriage to naming your child to starting education and leaving home.

Have you ever gone through an identity crisis? This movie is a battle of sorts with who I am, who my parents want me to be and who I want to become. It was a great story of coming full circle into finding the true you. The movie tells of a boy that wants to do away with his name. In his family the traditional naming process is the elder's job and in this case, Ashima's (the mother) grandmother. They wrote to the grandmother to ask her to name the baby, the letter never arrives and soon after, the grandmother dies. Ashoke (the father) suggests the name of Gogol. He chooses this name for two reasons. One, it is the name of his favorite Russian author and two, he was Gogol's book just before a train accident and a page of that book was clutched in his hand acting as a flag in the darkness for rescuers to find him. Fast forward Gogol hates this name. His father tries to explain the significance of it, but he senses that Gogol is not old enough to understand. As Gogol progresses through school, he hates his name more and more. He informs his parents that he wishes to change his name. His father is rather indifferent to the idea but agrees. Shortly before leaving for college, he travels to the courthouse and has his name legally changed to Nikhil Gogol Ganguli. Not only does he not want the name that his father chooses but he also didn't carry on in his father's footsteps to MIT and goes to Yale. This sets up barriers between Gogol and his family. The movie shows him living the life that he chose and the consequences that follows. The Namesake shows Gogol bouncing between his Hindu roots and his American birthright in the search for his own identity.",1365897600,,2270,4.550122249388753

Kal Penn is a good actor and I really enjoy all of his movies and the shows he has played in. This was a movie of a pretty traditional Indian family with reblious teenagers. It began when a young Indian man traveled back to India to find a wife. They had two children, Gogul (Kal Penn) and a girl Sonia. The lived in New Jersey and during the growing up the kids in school really picked on them for being Indian, especially Gogul for having not only a very unusual name but because he had the name of a ""crazy"" writer. When they traveled to India for 90 days they really came to know their heritage and the traditions they rebeled against from their mother and father. The death of Gogul's father is what really brough them together and Gogul to really understand and want to be the Indian he was born. He married a Bengali women which really made his mother happy because he was also Bengali and in their culture it is what is ""suppose"" to happen. This women had an affair, and Gogul divorced her and travled India when he finally felt free and his whole self.

1559510,4,B00005JP60,"Namesake is a movie that captures the viewer's attention through its rich culture about two different countries, which are totally different from each other, India and the United Sates. The movie Namesake is based on a novel that is written by Jhumpa Lahiri. The movie Namesake is set in Calcutta and New York over a period of several decades. This story is about a family who struggles to keep up with their true roots, while living in America. The religious practice in the movie is Hinduism, Ashok and Ashima had their traditional Hindu wedding.  The family of four includes Ashok (father), Ashima (mother), Gogol (main character), and Sonia (sister). The Hindu practice is still practiced even when Ashok and Ashima move to America and start their life together, and they also try to raise their children with their religious background.  Gogol is the oldest son of Ashok and Ashima. Unfortunately, Gogol is faced with uncomfortable situations with his name, obviously because it is different and it isn't a common name. Gogol struggles to value his culture from India as well, he is American born so that is expected.  The movie is about the name that Gogol has, how important his name is to his father, he doesn't know till it's too late. Ashima never calls her husband by his name, as it is considered very intimate (also very personal, in order to show respect women don't usually call their husband's by their name).  This is also related with how Gogol was named after his father's favorite author. Gogol fails to understand that and ends up changing his name as he found it to be an awkward name. He eventually ends up changing his name to Nikhil (which his parents told him that he would be known as in school but Gogol was confused--he thought if he changed his name his identity would change, so he wanted to be Gogol , then). This was a very good movie, it did lack ""moving"" moments sometimes, it did get a little boring but still kept my attention because I wanted to know how the movie ended and how Gogol would grow up to be a wise man.",1352678400,,2054,4.634615384615385

Kal Penn is more convincing later in the movie, as the adult Gogol; both he and his ""sister"" don't fully convey the book's complex negotiations of second generation childhood, but they (literally) get better with age. It is unfortunate that the sister's experiences are left out so much in the film -- this is also the case in the book, but the film version could have almost deleted her character entirely (except for the fact that a single-child family is almost unheard of in Bengali culture).

Irrfan Khan steals the show with his calm and unguarded presence on screen. Quiet and unassuming, his character helps the audience thread together all the different experiences of being a first-generation immigrant to the US.

The couple decides to move to America in hopes for a new life but having difficulty adjusting to America's culture. The couple basically not knowing much about each other starts to get used to each other. Not much later they give birth to a baby boy. The parents couldn't leave the hospital until they came up with a name for the child after going through a few things to try to come up with a name, they finally name him. His father names him after an author to a book he was reading when he was involved in a serious train accident. As he gets older he becomes your average American guy. He doesn't like his name any more and wants it changed so he goes to his parents. They agree on Nickk. He begins to rebel against his parents, starts to have sexual relations, and starts to do drugs and smokes cigarettes. He meets an American girl at a party that he begins dating. She is from a wealthy family. The son eventually introduces his girl friend to his mother and the mother wasn't really happy to meet her. The girl kisses his mother on her cheek and the mother was not happy that she kissed her on her cheek. Later he is due to come home and his father couldn't reach him because the sons train loses electricity. When the father finds out he is okay he explains to him again the importance of his name. The son starts to have different feelings about his religion. A little after his father dies. He breaks up with his girlfriend and begins spending more time with his family. His mother wants him to contact a daughter of one of her friends who he really doesn't want to meet. He meets with the girl and the two are married. He divorces her because of infidelity.
The movie relates to religion with the parents as a young couple.  Having a arrange marriage is a Indian tradition which most American's marry for love, children, and money but their tradition you are married through the parents choosing your spouse attempting to avoid courtship, people must also understand this is not forced marriage.  Religion also deals with language and the couple had to veer away from their language in order to adjust to the life of an American.  Americans usually choose a name because it sounds nice or maybe named after a famous person or a family member.  With their religion when the son was born they name children for meaning to bring purpose to the child's life.  Another practice for their religion of the Indian couple was when the son brought his girlfriend to his house and the girlfriend kissed the mother on the cheek showed disrespect because they do not show public affection.  Through the entire movie even though the couple moved from the home, the mother never veered away from her practice, she always wore the long robe/dress.",1321747200,,2879,4.526923076923077

Like many teenagers, their son rebels against everything they stand for until the death of his father.  Then he does a complete switch, dumps his American girlfriend, and ends up married to a Bengali girl who has also eschewed tradition.  Kal Penn did a wonderful job of seeming like a petulant brat throughout much of the movie (and I am a fan of his), but the mother was my favorite character.  She really struggled to find her way in the film.  I loved the scene in the Laundromat after they first arrived, when she shrunk the clothes.  She wanted her children to be happy but very traditional.
The Hindu religion was quite evident throughout the movie, but not made a huge deal out of.  It was more subtle.  It was used in the traditional wedding ceremonies and in the funeral rites of Gogol's father.  The scene on the bank of the Ganges River when they scattered the father's ashes was particularly touching.

Whenever I find this movie on TV, I make sure I either DVR it or watch it right then and there, because it really is a great movie. So far, I think I have seen it three times by these methods.

Let me first start by elaborating on how Kal Penn is under-appreciated. This film came out after the first Harold and Kumar, as well as Van Wilder...both are comedies and had pretty much established Kal Penn as a comedic actor. But with this film, Kal Penn gave a performance that undoubtedly rolled out the red carpet for his open-armed welcome into more serious roles.

The movie itself is a great watch. Even though I have seen it three times now, I would gladly watch it again, because of how it explores the loss of identity children of immigrants have with their roots, and then Gogol's return to those very same roots. The balance between Gogol's American life and his Indian heritage are shown in the form of the two women he falls in love with; the white, American girl Maxine..who ironically has an interest in Indian culture, and then the Indian girl, Moushumi...who is very much not your typical Indian girl.",1303516800,,1263,4.510917030567685

This movie is about Goghol, an Indian boy who grows up in America. His parents are from India, and he considers himself an American, a New Yorker. He doesn't really put too much attention towards his roots and is apthetic to the traditions. He almost seems embarrassed by his heritage. His parents went through a lot in their lives, and try to raise their kids in the best way possible, offering them a suburban, American life. Goghol's dad gets into a terrible train wreck at the beginning of the movie. He names Goghol after his favorite author, so that the name has meaning. Goghol refuses to go by this name, and just goes by Nick. He has an American fiancee and is planning to marry her. Along the way, many things happen. Nick changes his perspective, matures and starts to embrace his heritage. He takes a trip to India that changes him. He has flashback's from his trips as a child, and things that didn't matter or that he didn't pay attention to before have meaning. He reads Goghol's book, becomes spiritual, and goes by his real name. In the movie, there are aspects of Hinduism: there are prayer sessions in their house with a ton of people, they have funerals, and a Hindu wedding ceremony. Goghol shaves his head, which I don't know if is a requirement in Hinduism, but is reminiscent of the Hindu monks that wear the orange robes.",1303430400,,1360,4.573770491803279
1559617,4,B00005JP60,"The Namesake was a movie that made one really think about the struggles of everyone's life. It portrays the things that all people may have to overcome in some points of their lives, no matter what religion that they are or where they may live across the globe.
The movie started off by showing the customs of how women are supposed to respect and honor the men and the customs that they have about arranged marriages. The woman in the movie that was the main character was an honest and sweet young girl. She was arranged to marry a man and to live in New York. The city life for her was at first challenging to adapt to. She was living without being close to her family, in a new city, and married to man that she just met. She overcame all the odds and fell in love with this man. The man was a hard worker and a provider. They eventually had two children, a boy and a girl. The woman held fast to her traditions and upbringing.
As the movie continued, the young boy had a period in which that he did not have a name. He grew up being called a name that was only supposed to be for a short period of time. He liked the name enough to request to his parents that he would be known as this for the rest of his life. He was around five when he said this and as he grew older, he also grew to hate his name. His sister and him grew up very Americanized, so the name that he had no longer fit that mold. He would be taunted at school to the point that he asked his father why he would name him such a name. The name was deeper than he realized and understood his father's reasoning. Nevertheless, this did not alter is decision to call himself another name when he became a famous architect.
He was to marry outside of his culture, but that did not work to his best interest. Then he married to a female that was his culture and religion. His father passed away in the movie leaving his wife in a serious depression because she felt like she did not only lose her child, but her husband too.",1302048000,,1989,4.115681233933162
1559618,4,B00005JP60,"This movie by Mira Nair is a look at the lives of a Bengali family and their extended community of families in the United States.  The Gangulis come to the US to better themselves and provide an opportunity for their children.  The story is more centered around their only son Gogol, (Kal Penn) is so named after a writer which his father treasured (Russian writer Nikolai Gogol), although he does have a sister, Sonia, in the story also.
 This is an insightful look at the traditions and the culture of the Bengali people, but interestingly, the film goes a bit deeper than just allowing the viewer a glimpse into the culture of the people, it also shows how the senior Gangulis, struggle to hold on to their traditions as their children become influenced by the western culture seemingly, more so, than the traditions long held by the family.  Gogol grows into a rebellious teen that seems to be bothered by his parents.  He soon is dating a young lady, of non-Indian descent, that he abandons his family for;  he is spending more and more time with her family and avoiding even phone calls from his own family.  It is at his father's death that Gogol figures out that he and Maxine perhaps are a mismatch, when she does not understand his grief.
 It is here that Gogol reconnects with his cultural roots and you see the relationship of the Gangulis to the Hindu world from which they have come and are still immersed.  There is an arranged marriage true to their tradition.  Later, Gogol shaves his head when his father dies, also true to tradition.  Also following tradition, there is a ceremony in the Ganguli home that is culturally driven.  There is a return trip to India to throw Ashoke's ashes in the sacred Ganges River, which is a ritual act to ensure he gets into heaven.  The music, colors and chanting all resonate within Hinduism.

I had to see this movie since I have seen all other Mira Nair directed movies. I consider her to be a very, very good director. I was not disappointed at all.

The movie has been directed with sensitivity, maturity and balance. There are no excessive emotions or over dramatization. It is a good story and the movie narrates the story effectively.

The greatness of the movie is the extraordinary acting by Tabu. The other actors, Irrfan Khan, Kal Penn and others, have acted well, but Tabu's acting will be the top-of-the-mind recall for this movie. I had not realised that she is `so, so!' good!

There is good footage about the visit to the `awesome' Taj Mahal. The story did not explore the marriage of the daughter to an American. That would have made it a more comprehensive story of an Indian born, cross-over family with the new generation as Americans.",1296432000,,1025,4.584699453551913
1559620,4,B00005JP60,"I love Jhumpa Lahiri's work more than words. Her writing is beautiful and fluid, and her stories flow beautifully.

This movie, unfortunately, does not follow her example. The story is told well, but the acting is just horrible. Kal Penn is absolutely terrible. There's a reason that he's famous for Harold and Kumar-like roles. Every line that he delivers sounds exactly the same (nasal and overly dramatic), and his teenage angst is completely unbelievable. Whoever it is that plays his sister is equally bad (I'm sure that's why I've never seen her in anything else). And good lord, Zuleikha Robinson is horrible also - her only saving grace is that she is stunningly beautiful. The three of them overacting every single scene like they do is almost painful to watch. In fact, Gogol's first girlfriend in the movie, Maxine (played by Jacinda Barrett), is a better actress than them all, and she only had a minor part in the film. It was almost as if they wanted to cast the worst actors they could find.

However - I gave this film 4 stars because the actors that portray Gogol's parents, Irrfan Khan and Indian actress Tabu, are absolutely breathtaking in their roles as a traditional Indian couple. The chemistry between those two characters is gorgeous to watch. Seeing them together was worth watching the rest of the crappy movie. Tabu is so, so beautiful, I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before.

If you really want the experience of this story, please read the book. Don't expect too much from this movie, mostly because its 'star' acted in a movie about traveling across the country in search of a hamburger.",1295049600,2,1635,4.790780141843972

1559622,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake was an interesting movie to say the least. I am giving it a rating of 5 stars due to the production, cultural aspects, and acting. On the other hand, the movie is truly depressing and I felt the plot was weak. Some may say this is too harsh, but this is the experience I had while watching it. The movie starts out with two men conversing on a train. The train wrecks and many of the people did not survive. When the accident occurred, one of the men, Ashoke, was reading a book by a particular author named Nikolai Gogol which later becomes the inspiration for his son's name. After the train wreck Ashoke moves to America.

Later in the movie, Ashoke goes back home to India and meets a woman, Ashima, whom he then marries. They move from Calcutta to New York. At this point in the movie, it starts moving very quickly. It shows a sexual scene after the marriage and then she is at a maternity checkup having contractions. It shows a baby after it is born and the man at the hospital is asking what the baby's name is. There is a cultural conflict here because it is customary for the grandmother to name the baby, but she is in India and 85 years old so they say it will be awhile. The man at the hospital says they must choose now, so Ashoke chooses ""Gogol.""  Later in the movie, Gogol goes by ""Nick."" Shortly thereafter, Ashima  is holding a baby and Gogol is walking with Ashoke by the ocean. It only shows a few short scenes at this age, then fast-forwards 15-20 years. Kal Penn (from Harold & Kumar movies) plays the older Gogol and Sahira Nair plays the daughter, Sonia.

This movie is culturally significant because it shows a lot of traditions in regard to marriage, customs of limited physical touch, and the importance of marrying and dating within their own Indian race. When Gogol dates a Caucasian woman, his parents do not approve and are not friendly when they meet her. They want him to date inside his own race. Having been born in America, Gogol does not see this as being important so there is a clash between cultures. Shortly after this, Ashima's father dies and everyone is upset. Then a few scenes later, Gogol's father dies and everyone is upset again. Shortly thereafter, Gogol is dating an Indian woman and they are married, but then she tells him she is having an affair....so of course that ends poorly as well. In my opinion, the movie really took a turn for the worse after people started dying. From a positive perspective, I will say that the culturally significant aspects of the film such as the customs, the cultural clashes, the diverse clothing and burial customs....are all interesting and accurate to my knowledge. My final verdict? The movie is overall depressing and I would not recommend it for entertainment value.",1284854400,,2773,4.551102204408818
1559623,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is an inspiring story about Gogol Ganguli's battle as an American-Indian living and growing up in America and having Indian born parents who are stuck in Indian culture.  The setting of The Namesake is in 1977 in Calcutta, India. Gogol's parents were born here and are Bengalis and practice the traditional Bengali/Indian customs. Ashima is Gogol's mother and she marries another Bengali and moves to America with him. She makes a life in this country and raises her two children Gogol and Sonia. Gogol battles with his roots and wants to be an American. He moves to New York and begins to go by the name Nick. He settles down with a Caucasian American girl named Max. Then a drastic change occurs which makes Gogol return to his roots. He learns of the reasons behind his name Gogol that he hates so much and he learns to appreciate it and his culture. The Namesake is a great story about how life is a beautiful journey and just how important and meaningful just a name can be.

This movie relates to World Religions drastically because the main characters are Indians from Calcutta, India, which is the home to Bengali/Indian culture, which is of Hinduism. Therefore, the characters are Bengalis and practice traditions that have been passed on for many years. In this movie you can see the role of women as Bengalis because Ashima (Gogol's mother), does not get much choice in picking her future. She has to marry young and marry another Bengali. This tradition makes her move to America, which she calls, ""the lonely country"", and all she wants to do is go back home.  Her husband Ashoke basically takes on the role of her father and is now her teacher (which is the role of men to women). He teaches her everything she knows for now on, down to how to live alone. At the end of the movie Ashoke's ashes are spread in the Ganges in India and The Ganges River is considered to be a very pure and sacred place and it is tradition to place cremated ashes of dead ones in the river so their sins will be washed away (Living Religions 87).",1284854400,,2052,4.54054054054054

Gogol, the main character, is born two to Bengali parents in an American hospital.  His parents are forced to choose a name for the child before he can leave the hospital and they choose his nickname Gogol.  Gogol refers to the Russian author that his father has a connection to.  Later, Gogal is given a public name of Nikhil which he uses going off to college.  Gogol immerses himself in American culture and goes by the name Nick after college.  Most of the movie deals with his romantic relationships with two women.  One is a very American woman and the other is Bengali.  In the end, Nick makes some peace with is Indian heritage after his father dies and his mother returns to India.

This movie is mainly about the struggle between Nick's heritage and his modern life.  Nick is a very American character but his parents are very Indian.

The story starts before the couple meets, when the young man, Ashoke, is involved in a train wreck. He later meets his bride to be, Ashima in an interview arranged by their parents. They move to the United States and face all the difficulties associated with living in a country that has a much different culture.
 Right after moving, Ashoke must leave Ashima alone so that he can go to work. He tells her that he will show her how to use a washing machine at the laundry later. She decides to go alone, and ruins many of their clothes. She also must be taught how to use their gas stove. These small tasks, that she does not know how to do, show the deep contrast in the two cultures.
 When the couple has their first child, they are told they have to name the boy before he is able to leave the hospital.  This is another piece of culture shock for them. They explain that it is customary for the grandmother to name the child, and because she is in India, they will have to wait until a letter can be sent there, and then wait on a reply. They decide to give their son a temporary name, Gogol, and then rename him at a later date. This temporary name becomes the underlying theme for the title of the movie.
 Throughout the movie there are many references to the Indian culture and their religion. There are many ceremonies, some elaborate, such as the weddings. These seem very ritualistic. The faces are painted and there are chants by the people in attendance. It is very much an interactive process for the couple as well as the guests. When there is a death, there are specific things to do. It shows two different men, one in the scene, and the other in a flashback, who shave their heads. The ceremony surrounding the death of one man is held in the home. All of the mourners are dressed in white. This is different from the American culture in that black is the customary color worn.
 Although this movie is quite different from the casual escapism movie that seems to permeate the theaters, it is definitely worth watching. It offers insight on a different culture, and how it can both clash and intermingle with the American culture.",1284854400,,2275,4.4330143540669855

Then they have kids a boy first and then a daughter. The boy Gogol is the main character in the story. It is about his name and how he got it, which growing up his whole life he just thought he was named after his Dad's favorite author. He doesn't find out the true meaning till later in the movie.
 Now with growing up in America he gets a lot of crap for his name in school then when he is old enough decides to change it. Then later on he ends up falling for a white girl who he basically just visits her family and kind of puts his on the back burner. It is not until Gogol finally brings his girlfriend home to meet his family and that's where his father finally tells him how he got his name.
 His father says why he chose the name Gogol was he was reading a book when he was a student in school on a train and the train end up crashing killing many people and the reason the father named him Gogol was that everything after that day was a gift and that's why he named him Gogol was to remind him of the gift every day.
 Then the father ended passing away and that is when Nick (Gogol) decided to finally come home and start supporting his family and their beliefs. It was very hard on the mother and she felt like she had lost her reason for living. Then they ended up taking the fathers ashes and throwing them in the Ganges River just like some Hindu's do because they believe the river is a god.
 This movie relates to world religion through telling the story of how a man and women from India started their life in a new country totally different from the way they had been raised and raising their children in this country. Then there children became more interested in the American culture then their Indian culture. Also, it shows some of the clothes that people in India where, what a customary wedding is like, and what they do when someone dies. One thing that was very interesting to me was all the Hindu women in the movie had a red dot or ""Bindi"" indicating that they were married but when Gogol's father died his mother removed her Bindi from her forehead.",1284768000,,2650,4.169921875
1559686,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is a beautiful and heartfelt story that gives insight into the lives affected by traditional cultural beliefs while being raised in another country who's liberal way of life is completely different. The movie begins with the Ashokie meeting his arranged bride to be, Ashima. They get married in the form of Bengali tradition and move to the United State from India. Ashima is new to the country, whereas Ashokie has lived in the states for three years prior to getting married.
  Ashokie and Ashima immediately start a family. Gogol is their first born son, and Sonia is their daughter that is born approimately four years later. It is tradition for the grandmother to name her grandchild and sometimes this is not done until the child reaches the age of five or six in India. However, in the states, the child must have a documented name before it can leave the hospital. Ashokie decides on Gogol as a temporary name. As the child enters kindergarten his parents change his name to Nikhil. The problem with this is that young Gogol likes his name and does not want to change it and his parents agree to let him remain as Gogal.
  Once Gogal is in high school and his studies become more broad, it is brought out to the class that an eccentric man having the same name was crazy, along with other negative characteristics. Some of the kids in Gogol's class begin to pick on him and associating him with the writer. Before Gogol enters college at Yale he decides he wants to change his name to the more proper Nikhil. Gogol's parents aren't fond of this change, but wants Gogol to be happy, and accepts his decision. They also want him to have a good time at college and to date, but puts the stipulation on him to remember to marry a Bengali girl.
  Nikhil falls in love with an American girl and decides that he doesn't want what his parents want for him. There is a life altering moment for Nikhil. His father passes away. It is not until his father is gone that Nikhil (Gogol) puts some thought into what his father tried to instill in him. Nikhil breaks up with his girlfriend, Maxine, who truly loved him and wanted to be there for him. He changes his name back to Gogol, re-connects with a Bengali girl, and gets married.
  The long and short of this marriage is that Gogol's wife is having an affair and leaves him. His mother wants to pursue her dream as a classical singer and wants Gogol to be happy. Gogol's sister marries a man she loves who is not Bengali and is accepted.
  This movie pulls at the heart strings as it shows how difficult life can be for a person to be raised in a country that is liberal and does not share the same cultural belief's as a migrated family's religious beliefs. World religions are much the same way, in that being exposed to another way of life does not mean that it is tolerant of going against tradition. However, tradition is hard to follow when a person has been raised in a totally different cultural presence.",1284336000,,2974,4.500927643784786

A Mira Nair Film

While returning by train from a visit with his grandfather, Ashoke Ganguli  has a life altering  encounter. He is reading a book by Nicholai Gogol. His grandfather has always told him that reading is a way to travel without taking a step. As he is reading on the train, he meets with a fellow traveler, Ghosh, who encourages him to travel and see the world. Ghosh speaks of having spent two year abroad and encourages Ashoke to do the same. Later during the train ride, the train has an accident and many are killed but Ashoke is just badly injured. Following a time of recovery, Ashoke takes Ghosh's advice and moves to New York City. After having gotten settled in America, Ashoke returns to India in 1977. He proposes to a beautiful singer by the name of Ashima. They return to New York to build their lives together. Shortly after their return, they become the joyous parents of a son name who they initially name Gogol. A few years later, Sonia, a daughter is born. The family travels to India twice, the second being when the kids are older teen agers. They experience a life changing visit to the Taj Mahal. After becoming a college student Gogol falls in love with Maxine and moves in with her family. While Ahoke is away teaching in Ohio, he dies of a massive heart attack and now Ashima is alone again as Sonia has move out of the family home. Gogol returns for the death ceremony with Maxine intow. He is torn between the life that he has come to know in America and the rich strong traditions of his and the other Bengali families they have been so influential during his life.

I think this movies ties into my class world religions in a few ways but the one that caught my attention most was the relationship of the worlds of Maxine and Gogoli. You had the rich all American blonde whose family had a vacation home in New England. Everything was very open and non-traditional. Gogol on the other hand, having been raised by devout Hindu and having grown up in that culture, is more respectful of the traditional way of life. Family relationships are very important in Hinduism. Maxine had never seen ay form of puja, public worship on the behalf of Gogoli, so it was understandable that she would not realize the importance of the ceremony and family/friends gathering when Ashoke dies. She tries to rescue him from something that he now knows he has to embrace. It is a part of him. It is who he is.",1284163200,,2445,4.487640449438202
1559688,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake was a suprise to me, I really liked this movie. It's a story of a Bengali family and their move to the U. S. A. The story line of packing up, leaving everyone and everything you know is fasinating to me. My daughter had a friend in high school that did the same, until now I never really appreciated what it meant. I could understand Gogol's mother and how she felt. When your children are small you are the center of their universe, as they get older and want independance it's hard to let go. Your afraid they won't come back, you will be forgotten. I cried with her when her children didn't go home for the holidays and when she was alone when her husband passed.
As for Gogol, I was a teenager once, I understand the struggle for independance, to find his idenity here. Several times I felt myself get angry at him because of how he treated his parents but thats part of growing up and letting go. I was proud of him when he was there for his mother after his Dad passed but I do think he married the wrong girl for the wrong reasons.
The only thing I have seen Kal Penn in is House, I liked this much better. Thsi movie touches so many issues that happen in families of all walks of life. While family ties can be fragile it is a bond that will keep you together forever.

1559690,3,B00005JP60,"I watched the movie The Namesake as an assignment for my Living Religions class.  The Namesake is a movie that was released in 2007 and is based on the book The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri.  The first part of the movie moves quickly across time, changes of scenary, and at times it is hard to follow.  Throughout the beginning of the movie we are shown bits of the main characters, Ashoke and Ashima's, lives.  From their wedding to the birth of both of their children, Gogul and Sonali and we are shown how Ashima adjusts to living in New York City and away from her home in India.  Often these pieces do not appear to fit together until the ending of the movie is revealed.

  The movie is appropriately titled The Namesake.  Throughout the movie there is a lot of discussion regarding their son, Gogul's name.  When Gogul is first born the hospital insists that the baby must be named prior to leaving.  However Ashoke and Ashima are awaiting a name from Ashima's grandmother and do not want to choose a name on their own.  Faced with the dilemma they decided to name the baby Gogul until the official naming ceremony is performed.  Later when baby Sonali is having her naming ceremony, Ashima discusses Gogul starting school and we learn that Gogul will use his proper name, Nicholai Gogol Ganguli because this name would keep him from being picked on.  To his parents dismay Gogul tells his teacher's to call him Gogul.  Gogul's name continues to be a discussion throughout the movie.  We learn through a scene with Gogul in high school, that he was named after Nikolai Vasilievich Gogul.  Gogul is furious with his family when he learns that Nikolai was a brilliant Russian writer that his teacher described as an eccentric, genius, hypochondriac, who never married, had no children, and committed suicide by slowly starving himself.  At a visit to his parent's house, it is revealed that Ashoke gave Gogul his name because of a flashback we saw at the beginning of the movie.  The flashback depicted Ashoke on a train that crashed and nearly killed him.  Prior to the crash, Ashoke met a man who inspired Ashoke to live abroad and view the world.  Ashoke was reading a book when the train crashed by his favorite author named Nikolai Gogul.  By naming Gogul after the author, Ashoke is reminded each day is a blessing.

  The movie also dipicts the struggles of Hindu families face trying to fit into the American culture.  Gogul and Sonali are both shying away from their heritage and embracing the American culture.  Gogul is shown hanging out with friends, doing drugs, rocking out to music and is going to Yale.  The family visits India, and we are shown how disgusted Sonali is with being there due to the culture.  As the family sight sees through India, and visits the Taj Mahal, Gogul decides to study Architecture.  As Gogul grows up, he becomes more Americanized, and changes his name to Nikolai in order to compete in the business world as an architect.  He falls in love with an American girl named Max whom he spends all of his time with, and begins distancing himself from his parent's traditional ways.

  When Gogul's father suddenly dies of a heart attack Gogul realizes how detached from his family he has become, and begins making things right by living through his heritage.  Gogul shaves his head as a symbol of mourning for his father's death.  He also breaks up with Max and actively participates at his father's funeral.  He travels with his mother to spread his father's ashes in the Ganjis.
Upon returning to New York, Gogul embraces his heritage and begins dating a Hindu girl named Moushumi.  Mushumi does not appear to be a practicing Hindu and is Americanized.  The two however, are married in a traditional Hindu marriage ceremony and appear happy.  However, we learn that Moushumi is having an affair with a French acquaintance named Pierre.  Gogul is heartbroken.  The movie ends with several flashbacks.  Most importantly the flashback of Gogul and his father at the beach after Sonali was born.  In this scene, Gogul's father tells Gogul to experience the world.

  The movie was a good learning experience for someone who is not familiar with the Hindu religion and culture.  There were several great examples of the culture.  In the beginning of the movie we are shown the goddess Saraswati that is being hung in the street for some sort of celebration.  The movie depicts a traditional Indian home, town and dress.  We are shown two traditional Hindu weddings as well as a Hindu funeral.  I did not understand the head shaving at first, but after researching it discovered that it is called tonsure.  It is done to purify, and is a symbolic offering to the gods.  The movie also portrays the different dress that Hindu's wear.  When Sonali goes to India with the family she has to have new clothes made so she will be dressed appropriately.  The naming ceremony is portrayed when Sonali is a baby.  There are two instances of arranged marriages.  The first instance is at beginning of the story when Ashoke and Ashima are married.  The second is after Gogul's graduation he is introduced to Mushumi, and their parents were trying to arrange a marriage at that time.  At the funeral, wedding and naming ceremonies we are shown punju being performed.  This movie while slow to start was a great way to experience the Hindu religion and culture and was a good story as well.  I would definitely recommend seeing this movie.",1275868800,,5463,4.728525980911983

I heard good things about the book, but this film does not inspire me to buy it, since here we are told a thoroughly generic intercultural story, with no nuance and no true depth. I've never cared to write a review on amazon.com, but was appalled when I saw the high approval rating (99 reviewers, 4.5 stars) for this poor excuse of a movie. If you like good cinema, don't waste your time with this pap. It's laughable. (Oh, and my girlfriend groaned in disbelief too. There was, I must say, perhaps one upside: it's been a while since I've read Gogol.

I like that the at first the son went against what his religion and parents. He dated a Christian instead of someone from the Hindu religion. I felt sad for him when he got married and then his wife ended up cheating on him. I really don't understand why he married her in the first place. Since she had different dreams then he did. I thought it was funny when the family went to visit there grandparents. The sister complained about not having air conditioning. Also she whined when her mother was embarassing her. It was ok in showing some of the culture that Hindu's do. I think that you would have to be an open minded person to watch this movie.

He moves to America to take up a professorship; he returns to India to meet a woman his parents have found for him. She likes him and they marry. She accompanies her husband back to America, where houses stand far apart and are covered by the grey snow of cities.

They have a first child whom they name Gogol after the Russian writer the husband so admires. The parents make American friends and are on good terms with most everyone. They are not, and can never be, quite at home in this alien land but they find contentment and happiness. They buy a home and invite their Indian friends to a traditional ceremony blessing their house.

The boy grows up in the United States and rebels against his Indian heritage. His parents accept this as a result of their own choice to live abroad. A trip back to India brings the relief of a homecoming, but the family must return to their new chosen homeland.

As a story, the Namesake hardly breaks new ground. Men and women marry, children can be difficult, life abounds with surprises both good and bad. On the other hand, the film masterfully generates instant empathy for the Indian family: even as a north-American non-Indian who knows nothing of life in India, I felt America was alien and India was home. We are the aliens, not this family.

1559744,4,B00005JP60,"The movie ""The Namesake""  deals with the trail and tribulations of a Bengali family living in New York. The story follows as Ashoke Ganguli falls into an arranged marriage with a young girl, Ashima. The two move to New York, where Ashoke has worked for a few years. The plot line continues as the couple have to become accustomed to American culture; washing laundry in machines, having gas at all times of the day, and the biggest step, having children in the US. Their firstborn, a boy named Gogol, after Nikolai Gogol, Ashoke's favorite author is the basis of the movie. Nikolai Gogol was a Russian author who was known for being somewhat crazy and suicidal, which Gogol learns through out high school.
The family, including Gogol's younger sister, Sonia, grow up in front of you, taking trips to India and experiencing their own culture, and also through becoming adults and figuring out what to do with their lives, which for Gogol includes a career in architecture and a relationship with Maxine, a master in Fine Arts. After his father dies, Gogol emerges on a journey of finding himself, breaks up with his American girlfriend and marries an Indian woman. The latter part of the story shows the path that Gogol follows to become at piece with himself, and his namesake, with which he has never been pleased, and at one point even changes his legal name to Nick.
This movie, though slow to start, blew my mind. The concepts of religions and culture that influence parts of the movie are deep and enlightening. As a viewer, you become accustomed to ideas of removing one's shoes at the door, witness marriage ceremonies, funerals, and the overall do's and don'ts of this family's culture. This movie heavily affected my view of Hinduism, which is much closer to religions like Christianity and Judaism than I previously expected. It demonstrates a cyclic point of view after Ashoke's death, explaining that the spirit remains though his body has returned to the earth through the Ganjis. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of family, and an interest in other cultures.",1265587200,,2095,4.819444444444445

To me it seems that through this relationship he tries to live another life and forget about his heritage that is until his father dies of a massive heart attack.

1559750,4,B00005JP60,"Based on the novel by Jhumpa Lahiri , ""The Namesake"" is a moving and thoughtful tale of two generations of Bengalese living in the United States.

The movie begins in India in 1977 with the arranged marriage between the sheltered Ashima (Tabu) and a young college professor named Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) who lives and works in New York City.  The film chronicles their early years as a couple, the births of their son and daughter, and the eventual maturing of those children into highly Americanized young adults.  The issue of arranged marriage - or at least the avoidance of a mixed marriage - inevitably comes to the fore as the young man, Gogol (""Harold and Kumar""'s Kal Penn), falls in love with a beautiful blonde artist he brings home to meet his parents.

With tenderness and sensitivity, ""The Namesake"" illuminates a dilemma that all immigrants must one day face:  how to assimilate oneself into the adopted culture while, at the same time, remaining faithful to one's roots.  The movie astutely captures the tension that develops between parents and their offspring when first-generation youngsters have no affection for - or even interest in - the Old World customs.

But this is more than just your typical multi-cultural generation-gap drama; it is an intensely moving look at personal identity, at marital and filial relationships, and at the deep and abiding bond that is family.  For, in the end, Gogol learns that he must embrace both sides of his heritage if he is to have any hope of discovering the person he truly is.

But personal growth is not limited solely to the younger generation, for the adults are forced to accept the fact that traditionalism comes with its own limitations and drawbacks as well.

The movie is bolstered by beautiful performances - most notably by Tabu and Khan as the two parents - and by lyrical and sensitive direction by Mira Nair, most renowned in this country for ""Salaam Bombay,"" ""Mississippi Masala,"" and ""Monsoon Wedding.""

With little fuss or fanfare, ""The Namesake"" manages to tell an epic story while remaining intimate in scope and specific in detail.  The screenplay by Sooni Taraporevala constantly shifts its point-of-view, so that different characters become the ""protagonist"" at various points in the story.  The result is a richly observed and fully rounded perspective on the events that unfold.

My wife and I watched it and quickly became engrossed in the lives of the characters. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace without ever becoming boring. It contains subtle subtexts of racism and cultural diversity, as well as some nice twists on the common ""fish out of water"" film cliches.

While there is no action per se, the story itself is captivating and the cinematography is compelling. The visuals of both America and India show both the beauty and the ugliness that is abundant in both nations. The film is joyous without being artificial and tear-jerking without being melodramatic.

The performances are subtle, textured, and as close to perfect as you will ever find. I guess the best compliment I can pay this little film is that my wife and I were still talking about it days after we watched it together, reliving our favorite moments. There is far more to discuss than one might think. There is multi-generational misunderstanding, cross-cultural confusion, a lifelong love story, and ultimately, the way these various issues help transform a confused young man into a mature and confident adult.

There are already dozens of positives reviews here that outline the plot and the performances, and I really have nothing new to add to those comments.

1559752,5,B00005JP60,"""The Namesake"" is a look into the lives of an immigrant Bengali-American family as two generations cope with conflicts of culture and life.  The parents assimilate into American life, arriving in this country as married grown adults.  They adhere to their Bengali traditions but learn to build new lives, far away from their roots and relatives.  The children, born in this country, regard themselves as ""American"" first, and seek to reconcile their family's upbringing and Bengali traditions with the secular, loose, American lifestyle. These are often in conflict.

""The Namesake"" refers to why the father, Ashoke, named his son ""Gogol"", honoring the famed but flawed Russian author.  Ashoke was reading one of Gogol's books while talking to a fellow train passenger outside Calcutta when there was a tragic train wreck. Before dying, the passenger advised Ashoke that life was short and to get out of India and see the world.  This was a life transforming experience, and as one of the few survivors of the wreck, Ashoke took his advice and ended up living and raising a family in America.  The name ""Gogol""  was a problem for the boy, making him the target of ridicule.  The idea of names and identity is a theme throughout the movie.

1559848,4,B00005JP60,"Jhumpa Lahiri's very popular novel THE NAMESAKE has been successfully adapted for the screen by Sooni Taraporevala and the gifted director Mira Nair has gathered a fine cast to capture the spirit of the original story of family commitment despite cultural changes and challenges.  Some of the novel's impact is lost on the big screen, but the tender message remains at the end.

In India a gifted young singer Ashima (Tabu) follows her family's rules of matchmaking and marries the quiet Ashoke (Irfan Khan), and soon after the wedding festivities are over the couple depart to New York for Ashoke's career.  The cultural and climate changes are a shock to both, but their marriage soon produces a boy child who, instead of being named traditionally by the grandmother in India, has to have a name assigned in the New York hospital in order to be released with a birth certificate.  Out of desperation, Ashoke decides to temporarily name him Gogol (Ashoke's favorite author)-played as a child by Sohan Chatterjee - , and the family of three soon becomes a family of four with the arrival of their daughter Sonia (Sahira Nair). While the parents maintain the customs of their Bengali heritage, the two children struggle with adapting to their preferred life in America and the conflict between parent and child is magnified by the cultural disparities.  As young Gogol grows toward manhood (now Kal Penn) he favors Western ways and becomes involved with a non-Indian girl Maxine (Jacinda Barrett) and her family.  Gogol tires of the critical comments about his name and decides to change his name to the more traditional Nick- further evidence of his separation from his background.  But family tragedies occur and Gogol finds himself drawn to his mother and to his roots.  When Gogol's father dies, the significance of his family grows even stronger and being unable to identify with Maxine and her family, he instead agrees to 'date' a Bengali girl from his past - Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson) has blossomed from the frumpy bookworm into a beautiful and experienced woman.  They marry, keeping to Indian traditions, but the marriage is rocky and in the end Gogol discovers that his true happiness is in the rich family history and beauty of his native India.

There are moments of rare beauty, both cinematically (camera work is by Frederick Elmes) and emotionally (musical score is a lovely creation by Nitin Sawhney), and while the film is somewhat brittle at times due to the occasional bilingual nature of the script, the main characters are portrayed by such strong actors that the little flaws become unimportant.  It is well to have so many films that deal with the immigrant experience at this particular juncture in our history, and when that theme is enhanced by the beauty of authors such as Lahiri, the messages become even more poignant.

1559849,3,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is a moving film about many things. It includes aspects of relationships, love and loss, family, and traditions. But it is mostly about connecting with one's true self. Through great performances from its principals, this concept is beautifully conveyed.

The film opens in India as we are introduced to young Ashima and Ashoke who are about to be wed through an arranged marriage. Thus begins a relationship that will anchor and become one of the main themes of the movie. Soon after being wed, Ashoke who lives in America relocates Ashima there as well. Having spent time in America already, Ashoke is right at home in New York where they now live. Not so for Ashima. She is at first taken aback at being so far from her home, in a strange land and knowing no one. Her aloneness is strikingly played. Through the passage of time, and with help from her new, loving husband, she gradually begins to grow more comfortable here. Eventually, they start a family; having first a son named Gogol, and a daughter - Sonia. The naming of Gogol (he was named after Ashoke's favorite author Nikolai Gogol), becomes another central theme in the movie.

As time passes, and Gogol gets older, the focus shifts towards his life and relationships. He decides to study architecture, after a trip back to India with his parents after the death of Ashima's father. After graduation, he becomes romantic with Maxine, who is not at all the type of girl for a Bengali Indian, straining his relationship with his parents. Another central theme is the disregard of the children toward their parents' Indian customs and culture. After struggling with a tragic event, Gogol and Maxine eventually break up. Ashima suggests that he re-connect with childhood friend Moushumi, who is also Bengali, and they hit it off and eventually marry. Sadly, this relationship would end also after Moushumi has an affair with an old flame.

The relationship of Ashoke and Ashima is also changed through a tragic event and we get to see Ashima dealing with being alone again. Her portrayal is particularly impressive here. Meanwhile, Gogol is coming to grips with loss and delving into some very personal realms where he ends up finding himself.

This film is remarkably beautiful in its cinematography, with scenery and locations that are vivid and exotic. You can almost smell Calcutta in several scenes. The editing is sharp and seamless as twenty five years passes in only two hours without feeling rushed or strained.  Director Mira Nair did an outstanding job leading the actors to deliver such emotional and drawing performances.

One other theme that is evident in the picture, although in a small way, is that of religion. In a few scenes, there are depictions of traditional Indian/Hindu wedding ceremonies. These are very colorful and joyous occasions. Very different from our Western practices, and I might add, a little more appropriate. There is also a customary Indian funeral ceremony where the mourners gather in the home and chant and pray, and another in India where the ashes are scattered in the Ganges River as is the custom of that religion.

The Namesake is a must-see if for no other reason, than we can all relate in some way to a character in this film, and learn to look inward at ourselves more deeply than before.",1221955200,,3315,4.867021276595745
1559850,3,B00005JP60,"Based on Jhumpa Lahiri's acclaimed novel, ""The Namesake"" tells the story of a young engineer, Ashoke Ganguli (Irfan Khan), and his new wife, Ashima (Tabu), who move from Calcutta to New York shortly after their marriage. Adjusting to life in a new country is difficult, especially for Ashima, but the Ganguli's children have an easier time blending in with American culture, because it's what they were born into. However, being an American-born child with Bengali parents is a difficulty in itself, and it's something that Ashoke and Ashima's son, Gogol (Kal Penn), has a very hard time dealing with. As Gogol grows into a young man, he distances himself from his family and embraces the American way of life. However, when tragedy strikes, Gogol realizes that his priorities are completely out of whack, and he attempts to make some changes in his life, but not everything goes according to plan.

This is a decent adaptation of a stunning book. The cast is fantastic, and I was especially impressed by Khan and Tabu's performances. I think that I expected more out of the film because I am such a huge fan of Lahiri's novel, so it was probably impossible for the film to measure up in my eyes. Lahiri's writing is just so incredibly descriptive and emotional, and it's impossible to transfer her beautiful words onto the screen, so the movie didn't really do it for me...the book is just so much richer and more powerful.

Gogol Ganguli has a funny name, a name that holds dear to his father, and a name of consequence that he does not understand. He belongs to a Hindu family living America, a family whose morals and values are still tied to India. From a young age Gogol was forced to maintain a balance between his American influences and Indian values. As he grew older, he became more distant from his Indian family, and closer to his girlfriend Max's family. His rejection of his heritage furthered when he chose to change his name from Gogol to Nikhil. However, all was going to change. Gogol's father, Ashoke, died of a sudden heart attack, leaving Gogol to realize that he needs to become closer to his family, and in order to do that, he needs to be closer to his culture. Before Ashoke's death, he told Gogol why he named him Gogol, because of life threatening accident he had, in his early years, while he was reading a book by Nikolai Gogol. Gogol understood, and was touched. Ashima, Ashoke's wife was faced with a life of singularity after his death, a life where she had to get a job, drive, and live alone, like any other single American. During this time, Gogol is swept away by Moushumi Mazoomdar, a Bengali girl who he knew from a very young age. He soon arranges to marry her. Their marriage is faced with the challenges of Moushumi's desire to study further, and her love affair with a French man. Gogol, heartbroken, grows further when he visits his mother's going away party to India. He stumbles upon a book, ""The Overcoat"" by Nikolai Gogol; a gift his father had given him, a gift he never opened, or cared about when he was alive. He is changed.
This story is a beautiful story of culture that was suppressed, and values that were forgotten. It has many vibrant scenes showing certain indian traditions and is a vivid portrayal of rituals. A story enhanced by the ethics that Ashima and Ashoke embodied and later passed to their children.",1221609600,,2157,4.576227390180879

The Namesake is a beautifully shot film that not only gets to the heart of the immigrant experience, but also tells a deeply moving tale about humanity -- about what it means to be human, vulnerable and dependent on both family and strangers in a changing and insecure world. There are brilliant acting performances in this film (the ""parent"" Indian actors Tabu and Irfan Khan especially). ""White Castle's"" Kal Penn does a fine job as the young son who at first refuses to understand his immigrant father's ""uncool"" ways then learns to respect and even admire his father's difficult and haunted past (we learn in the film that the father was the only survivor of a catastrophic train crash as a young man).

The film follows the lives of the parents as they move to America (with gorgeous, small touches by director Mira Nair that show the challenges of moving to a completely unknown country) and in its second half the film focuses on the son as he grows into maturity and suffers a devastating, unexpected heartbreak that helps (as he puts it) him become truly ""free."" In the mid-section of the film the family visits India for a summer; the children see and appreciate the rich heritage they had ignored to this point in their lives when they visit the Taj Mahal and ingest the astonishing sights and sounds of Kolkata (Calcutta). The film also boasts one of the best soundtracks of the year, which mixes gorgeous Indian tunes and Western music and seamlessly blends the songs with key images from the film.

The story of how he came to have the name he later loathes (and even later learns to appreciate). His struggle to find his way straddling both worlds, traditional and american. The gentle unwavering love and devotion from his parents not only for him but for each other. In a fit of mourning, he rejects his first love because she isn't Indian, but doesn't find what he hoped when he marries a woman who shares his traditional roots.
The scene in the car, with Gogol's father telling him about that life altering train ride that inspired his name, is just POWERFUL.

The characters deal with raising children in a new culture, sickness, death, love, betrayal, loneliness, etc. Although The Namesake has its joyful moments, I think its focus is on the struggles and the hard decisions that go into living in a foreign country; parents making the sacrifice of leaving their home for the sake of their children, and watching their children absorb the foreign culture and grow up into people they no longer understand.

I imagined from her previous work colorful characters, clothes and surroundings and sure enough, I was not disappointed.

Born and raised in the America to his Indian parents, he has difficulty trying to identify with his Indian ancestry.  So, his girlfriend is blond American girl from a higher social status and we see Nick slowly pulling away from his family.  It is only thru his father's death that Nick realizes who he is, what heritage really means to his family and him personally.  Inevitably, that means the end of his life that until that moment he has known.  And then again, it is Nick's marriage to Bengali woman he has known since his childhood that creates new conflicts in his life. Are the pressures of one's heritage such that one has to deny his/her true feelings toward a person of a different heritage?  How much is the modern life on the western hemisphere influenced new generations in the ways they want to live their lives?  I absolutely loved film's tenderness and its slow rhytm.  I felt drawn to the characters and curious about their inner life.

So what's new here?

In The Namesake, these universal themes, stresses, and conflicts play out in a family that has immigrated from Calcutta to New York, allowing the film to also explore immigration, culture shock, in- and out-marriage, and all the choices of identity that immigrants and their children can make.  This fresh setting allows us to see and feel the emotions in a new way.

Americans whose forbears immigrated generations ago will be fascinated when they join, for a few hours, the immigrant experience.  When they look at the themes in an Indian-American setting in this film, those whose families have come more recently can perhaps see the parallels and contrasts in their own lives.

With strong casting and fine (even lush) photography in New York and India, this is a film well worth watching.

1560136,4,B00005JP60,"This is a terrific film centered around an immigrant family from India merging into our society.  The plot goes through their trials and tribulations throughout 25 years of their lives.  While eye-opening in certain areas as to how harshly they are treated by others, it's also interesting the cultural differences between how the parents' lives were compared to their two children who were born and raised in New York.  This movie is a must-see for anyone wishing to gain a better appreciation for Indian culture and Hinduism.

Basically it starts off with Ashoke returning to India for a wife.  Their parents arrange for them to meet and they marry.  He brings Ashima to live with him in New York.  She is startled with the cultural differences but struggles through.  They go on to have two children and move to the suburbs to raise them.  Ashima's father dies suddenly and the family returns to India for a visit that gives their children exposure to their cultural roots and heritage.  Upon their return, their son Gogol begins to have trouble accepting his name due to all of the peer pressure.  He asks to change his name shortly after graduation to prevent any future issues.  He begins a relationship and loses touch with his own family in the process.  In the meantime, his dad's health begins to fail and while in Cleveland he dies suddenly of a heart attack.  This dramatic event results in Gogol returning to his cultural roots.  Ashima is left feeling lost and devastated without her husband.  Gogol begins to date the daughter of a family friend and they eventually marry.  Soon after, his wife feels too constricted in the marriage and begins an affair.  Gogol finds out through her slip of the tongue.  Sonia, Ashima's daughter, eventually finds her life partner as well.  While at the house for Sonia's announcement, Gogol finds a book his father left for him of his namesake giving him true meaning in life and its journey.  It is at this point he realizes that ""there are no accidents.""  Ashima eventually returns to India to follow her singing for six months a year.

Another intriguing aspect of this film is the many references to Indian heritage and Hinduism.  The story opens with the arrangement of marriage between Ashoke and Ashima and then their traditional Indian marriage ceremony which she is shown beautifully decorated.  After the birth of Gogol, they were shocked to learn that he could not leave the hospital until a name had been given for his birth certificate.  In India, the children are not formerly named until later.  The family from India came to visit for the first solid food ceremony, which is another significant Hindu celebration.  Many years later, the assimilation into American culture was noticed with their Christmas decorations.  Once Ashoke passed away, Gogol shaves his head, the family has a small ceremony in their home and then returns to India to leave Ashoke's ashes in the sacred Ganges River.  Gogol's marriage ceremony taken place in New York created another cultural clash since a fire was not allowed in the building.  Each time while in India, there are gods and goddesses publicly displayed.  Additionally, for each of these Hindu ceremonies, they use chanting, music, incense, etc. just as they would in India.",1202428800,,3280,4.896551724137931

The film shows problems common to many immigrant families in which the children do not hold the culture in the same reverence as the parents do...but with a fresh look. There is no sense of the director making accusations or judgements. We see events through the perspective of different family members --- which gives the viewer a sense of what would be felt by anyone, in any cultural or ethnic group.

Understated and not at all melodramatic, THE NAMESAKE gives an honest portrayal of a family that is coping with assimilation while trying to maintain its cultural heritage.

The film is linear, taking us on the journey of a marriage between two strangers, their adjustment to one another, and how they grow as their 'Americanized' children grow and push agaisnt their parents' cultural values. Many of the 'opposing values' scenes are subtle, which makes them more powerful in my opinion. This movie based on the best selling novel by Jhumpa Lahiri is one I found endearing. I suspect that my seventeen year old son only watched it because it featured Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar go to White Castle), but he's glad he saw it and appreciated Kal Penn's ability to play a 'serious' role with such heart.

There are many lessons to be learned throughout the storyline, and the acting is superb. If you want to think about how diverse a people we are, this movie should be on your to-view list.

Eventually the Gangulis have two children, Gogol and Sonia, and they become socially involved with other Indian immigrants.  Asoke and Ashima stay closely tied to their Indian heritage while their children try to be as American as they possibly can.  This wonderful movie explores the plight of the immigrant and shows how difficult it is to live in one country and have one's roots in another.

1560228,2,B00005JP60,"There was enough interest generated in The Namesake movie during its release, I felt it was worth renting it now. The movie is about an Indian family living their lives out in America. I was disappointed by this movie.

Cinematography was annoyingly inconsistent. Some scenes gave too much space above or below the actors. Others where just simply centered on the scene itself, without much regard to where the actors actually were in the scene.

Acting was good sometimes, but shoddy at other times. Some of the scenes lost importance because the acting wasn't up to par. This one scene where the father is trying to have a conversation about life with his son didn't work at all because Kal Penn was trying so hard to be the teenage with angst that it actually distracted from the moment instead of making the moment what it was meant to be (and needed to be) for the film. I would say it was a case of overacting, but I think a better word for it is wrong-acting. Also, other scenes suffered from a lack of acting effort.

Editing was not well conceived or executed. The flashbacks of Gogol's character (Ken Penn) came off as just cheesy. Some scenes were awkwardly cut in order to hold off on that portion of the story until later in the movie. This, unfortunately, made the movie seem like it dragged on, with random spatterings of story telling.

Overall, the story felt disjointed, without much reason for why it was edited this way. The story itself meandered from point to point. There was no real main character, though it was supposed to be Gogol. Most of the movie seemed aimless. Character motivation was poorly executed. Again, Gogol's character kinda just took action that didn't really have a solid explanation. It made the character seem extremely superficial, even as he faced up to his heritage (which I am sure was an unintentional impression by the film maker). Well, either way the story wasn't well written.

The movie appeared to be a jumbled mess. I can't understand what many of the critics saw in this movie. It was a lackluster attempt to show something didn't really end up being all the important to the story (why the main character was named Gogol). This movie seemed to be an independent film for which the big studios wisely did not waste their money. I'm sure I would've cared about this movie more were I of Indian background, but even then I would have to admit it was not an example of good film making.",1198540800,9,2441,4.628175519630485

1560230,5,B00005JP60,"Meticulously observed and wonderfully heartfelt, this time-spanning 2007 family dramedy represents a return to form for director Mira Nair, who faltered somewhat with 2004's elaborate but lugubrious&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanity-Fair/dp/B0006FO8E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanity Fair</a>. This one is also a literary adaptation but this time from a contemporary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/best-seller/dp/0618485228/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">best-seller</a>&nbsp;by Jhumpa Lahiri, who wrote an emotionally drawn story about first generation Bengali immigrants to the United States and their U.S.-born children. It's an intricate book full of careful nuances, and Nair, along with screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala, captures most of them in a most loving manner. The story speaks fluently to the universal struggle to extricate ourselves from the obligation of family and a perceived enslavement to the past. Nair and Taraporevala manage to transcend the necessarily episodic nature of the novel to make it an involving journey toward self-acceptance.

The film initially focuses on Ashoke Ganguli and his arranged marriage to Ashima, a classically trained singer. The young couple move from Calcutta in 1977 to Queens in order for him to pursue his career as an electrical engineer. The adjustment is difficult, especially for Ashima in assimilating into the often cold U.S. culture, and these quiet scenes show a keen eye for subtle observation. They quickly have two children in succession, son Gogol and daughter Sonia. Gogol's name is the key plot point as he was inadvertently after Ashoke's favorite writer, Nikholai Gogol, and this is revealed to have greater significance as the story unfolds. Eventually, the film switches the perspective to Gogol's as he grows up, changes his name to Nikhil and starts his life as a yuppie architect in Manhattan.

At the same, the film does not abandon Ashoke and Ashima as they remain significant figures in shaping Gogol's destiny, especially as the impact of a tragic turn brings unexpected changes. The cathartic aspect of these scenes is what makes the film powerful. Moreover, with her filmmaking experience in her native India and the U.S., Nair brings a seamless fluency to both locales. The movie falters a bit toward the end when it starts to ramble and feel pat, but the story's old world gravitas rescues it just in time. Beforehand I was convinced Kal Penn would be the spoiler in this film, but he gives a sharp, dedicated performance as Gogol. Poised to be taken seriously as an actor even amid his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Castle/dp/B00068WOH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Castle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Wilder/dp/B000069CF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Wilder</a>&nbsp;movies, he seems a bit exaggerated only in the early teenage scenes which recall those other movies.

However, it is the superb work of Irfan Khan and Tabu as his parents that make the film soar. Both bring a level of assurance and compassion that ground the film completely, especially Tabu who makes the seemingly modest character arc of Ashima really striking. Playing yet another variation of the spoiled American girl, Jacinda Barrett again proves how fearless an actress she can be in exposing the vanity and ignorance of Maxine, Gogol's first serious girlfriend. As Moushumi, the Bengali girl who comes with the family's seal of approval, Zuleikha Robinson has a ripe presence to match her character's aspiring worldliness. Cinematographer Frederick Elmes and production designer Stephanie Carroll provide masterful work in capturing the diverse flavors of the different locales. This film is for anyone who has struggled to forge his or her own identity only to find the need to embrace the past, especially those of us who have parents who displayed the courage to move from their native lands.

The 2007 DVD offers a robust set of extras, and the best is easily Nair's informative commentary track full of both professional and personal insights. Instead of the standard making-of featurette, we have a half-hour video, ""Anatomy of `The Namesake': A Class at Columbia University's Graduate Film School"" in which Nair and producer Lydia Dean Pilcher discuss more technical aspects of the filmmaking with the school's film students. There are a couple of photo gallery shorts emphasizing the film's impressive visuals, one covering the film overall and the other specific to Kolkata. Rounding out the extras are three brief deleted scenes (with optional commentary), a short interview with Penn, and several theatrical trailers.",1198195200,7,4798,5.929190751445087
1560301,5,B00005JP60,"I listened to the audio version narrated by Sarita Choudhury over a period of weeks while driving around and loved it. I remember vividly the times it brought me to tears or when I would sit in the parking lot of a grocery store mesmerized by the story. Today, I finally watched the movie with my daughter on DVD and both of us loved the movie. We weren't too embarrassed to cry and often just watched quietly with a lump in our throats. I think it means more to someone who can relate to that type of family background, who also came to this country as a student. I especially liked how Mira Nair was able to portray so well, the strong bond of affection between Ashok and Ashima. Having read the book, I could feel all the emotions Ashima was feeling....Tabu is just superb in this role. My only wish for the book was that Jhumpa Lahiri had developed the daughter's character a little more. I know how central a daughter's role is in an Indian family and it seemed like Sonia was always in the background. All in all, a top ten favorite.",1197158400,2,1039,4.333333333333333
1560302,4,B00005JP60,"The '06 release `Namesake' is a movie about living life and embracing the diversity of human experience without forgetting your family and the cultural roots from which you sprang. The most common theme in Indian films is the importance of family and loving ones parents. Though this is an American film the storyline and message are purely Indian in content and delivery.

While the plot is well constructed and imbued with pathos and depth, I found the film to be a little slow in development and somewhat short on emotional peak moments necessary to keep the audience fully involved. The real strength of the film is in the wonderful performances by Tabu and Ifran Khan as the newly married couple who leave India to embrace a new life in America. They are magical together and their understated yet profound performances are a joy to watch as they journey through life tied by a bound of unspoken love slowly unfolding in the years following their arranged marriage. Also starring in `Namesake' is the popular Kal Penn as their American born son Gogol.

Solid production values, excellent wistful soundtrack, poignant message and life lessons topped off by a number of excellent performances make `Namesake' a film well worth investing 122 minutes of your time.",1197072000,,1265,4.962264150943396
1560303,5,B00005JP60,"""The Namesake"" is the most memorable and enjoyable of all the films about South Asian immigrant families that I've seen. Based on the novel by Jhumpu Lahiri and directed by Mira Nair, it expounds on a familiar theme: Traditional immigrant parents struggling with a new culture and perplexed by their Westernized offspring. This film is always in motion, respectful of the characters' emotions but never stopping to wallow in them. It treats the parents' conventions and perspective as a matter of fact, not as a source of conflict or an issue in need of examination. Along with the striking performances, this approach sets ""The Namesake"" apart from other films with a similar premise.

In 1977, Ashoke Ganguli (Irrfan Khan) returns to his family home in Calcutta, India to find a bride to join him in New York, where he is a graduate student. Ashima (Tabu) is the playful, elegant young woman who agrees to marry Ashoke and embark on a new life far away from her country and family. The couple have a son, whom they name Gogol after the Russian writer whose stories played a role in a pivotal event in Ashoke's life. Gogol (Kal Penn) and his sister Sonia (Sahira Nair) grow up both fascinated and annoyed by their Indian heritage, while their parents are bewildered yet tolerant of their self-centered American children. Gogol's priorities and loyalty to family sometimes conflict, like his lifelong love-hate relationship with his name.

""The Namesake"" is as much about Ashima's adaptation as about Gogol's dual cultural identities. Bollywood star Tabu is beautiful but not pristinely so. Her face is so interesting that I never stopped wanting to look at her. She is radiant, self-contained, and thoroughly sympathetic. Irrfan Khan is amazing as unassuming, even-tempered Ashoke. My first impression of the cinematography was of ""ordinariness"". In fact, the work is very good and suits ""The Namesake"" perfectly. The view is always interesting. Color and design don't draw attention to themselves but reinforce the characters' authenticity. With first-rate performances and characters that make the audience curious to know them better, ""The Namesake"" may be Mira Nair's best film. In English and Bengali with subtitles.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""The Anatomy of The Namesake: A Class at Columbia University's Graduate Film School"" (32 min) features the director, producer Lydia Dean Pilcher, DP Frederick Elmes, the production designer, editor, and casting director explaining their work and answering students' questions. ""Fox Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Kal Penn"" (4 min) interviews the actor about Gogol. ""Kolkata Love Poem"" (4 min) is a visual tribute to the locations in India, with music. ""Photography as Inspiration"" (8 min) showcases some photos and the scenes that drew on them. The audio commentary by director Mira Nair is constant and detailed. She discusses her inspirations, intentions, and the elements of each scene, and how the film connects the worlds of New York and Calcutta. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish.",1196985600,2,3219,5.246601941747572
1560304,5,B00005JP60,"This is a very touching film about a young woman who meets a young man by the arrangement of the parents.  The story revolves anrond the couple and the life that they make for themselves and their children in America.  Actor, Kal Penn, practically begged Mira Nair (director of Monsoon Wedding and Mississippi Masala) for the role he plays here.  You may know him from Harold and Kumar go to White Castles or other silly comedies.  Penn longed to trade in his goofy, crazy film persona for one more serious and dramatic.  I'm happy to say he did a fine job here and know you can see him on televsion in the new doctor show called House.  His persistance paid off.

Penn's charachter is named Gogol, after Russian novelist Nikolai Gogol.  Gogol doesn't like being the novelist's namesake.  The film moves back and forth from Calcutta to New York and contrasts the lives of the characters in much the same way.  A couple from India moves to New York and brings their traditions with them only to be scorned and laughed at by their American born children who are New Yorkers to the core.

Kal Penn is correct when he states that this is an American film.  This story could have been told from anyone's perspective.  It could be an African family or an Irish family.  The story is not really driven by nationality.  The kids listen to rock and soul, smoke pot and don't really care about family customs.  At some point later in the film, Gogol learns exactly why his father gave him this name.  I won't spoil it for you here.  Life brings changes and reactions to those changes are very different with each family member.  The Namesake is definately a character driven film. Mira Nair has done a wonderful job directing here.  In it one can sense the pain she felt in losing someone close to her because she uses that pain as a vehicle to drive the film, as it were.  Still, the film is not as heavy handed as it could have been with another director.  There is sadness but there is light heartedness which runs throughout.

The cinematography is lovely especially in India.  Shots of the Taj Mahal are beautiful.  The entire cast performs wonderfully.  Kudos to all.  Tabu plays Ashima Ganguli (the mother) with modesty and grace.  Irfan Khan who plays Ashoke Ganguli (the father) uses very subtle facial expressions to convey feelings and thoughts.  Any more than that would have been overkill.

Please enjoy this movie.  Although there is some nudity, albeit brief, there are no sex scenes.  This movie has been rated pg 13.",1196726400,3,2523,4.612612612612613
1560305,5,B00005JP60,"I just watched ""The Namesake"" today and I must say it was a very delightful experience. I had waited for it to be in rental DVD, as I had read a lot about the movie. I enjoyed previous Nair's films, and I have always like Tabu's work. Without reading the book, I can say it is well-executed, with beautiful photograhy and excellent music. I was anxious to see a movie that would cover the very contemporary subject of belonging to a culture via parents, and belonging to another physically. I was very very pleased with the result. The only criticism I would have is the lenght. It does cover a lot for one movie, and I was curious to know what happened to some characters after the end. Besides that it was great to see Indian actors doing a great job in an American production. Very recommendable!",1196553600,,799,4.442176870748299
1560306,4,B00005JP60,"This is both Mira Nair's most comprehensive work and Kal Penn's most engulfing role.  He made a wise choice doing this film.  I love character-driven dramas, and this one is quite a mixture of heart felt emotion.  It's true to Nair's style and Indian heritage in that movies can depict complex emotion without becoming too syrupy.  Kal Penn is a winner in this one, and I'd love to see him in more dramas.  Up til now we've seen him in nothing but bombastic comedies save for Superman Returns in which he had no speaking part, but it always does an actor good when he exhibits versatility.  In one scene, he discovers a secret about his wife and for a split second, there's a forceful bit of rage which makes you go ""Wow!  Didn't know he had it in him.""  You want to see more of that.  I don't think it's a long shot to say that Kal Penn has Oscar potential because there obviously is more hidden talent within him than meets the eye.  Like Jamie Foxx, Penn is anchored in comedy, easily pulled off by his very funny persona; however, I think his strongest suit is drama, and we need to see more of it.  He just needs more venues to express it.

Irffan Khan and the ever excellent Tabu pull off extraordinary performances.  Bravo to Mira Nair and her crew.",1196553600,,1256,4.362068965517241
1560307,4,B00005JP60,"The novel on which this movie is based, while not Pulitzer-winning like its author Jhumpa Lahiri's first effort (Interpreter of Maladies), is nonetheless very well written and moving.  I enjoyed Interpreter of Maladies, and picked up the newer novel just before its theatrical release.  Also I admire director Mira Nair's previous film Monsoon Wedding, so with the two of them collaborating to bring this story to the screen, I think they've done an excellent job.  It is difficult to take such a story and all of its meaning and distill it into a couple of hours' worth of movie without sacrificing something.

I never expect a movie to be significantly better than the book on which it is based, however, in a couple of places in the film, the on-screen portrayals (due to superb direction and acting) are very emotionally charged and powerful, more so than you'd experience just reading the book.  In these instances, the cast really brings some of the more poignant moments of the story to life.

I recommend reading the novel and THEN seeing the movie.  For those who saw the movie first and felt it might have been missing something, do yourself a favor and read the book.",1196467200,,1178,4.773399014778325
1560308,4,B00005JP60,"`The Namesake' has several tug-of-wars going at once.  Like many immigrants coming to America, there is a draw to the freedoms and folkways of our country while trying to retain the best of the culture they have left behind.  Ashoke and his wife, Anshima, leave India to find adventure in the U.S.  Starting a family, he names his son Gogol after a friend's favorite Russian author, Gogol Nikolai.  Like many second generation Americans, Gogol (Kal Penn of 'Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-Kumar-Go-to-White-Castle-Unrated-Edition-UMD-Mini-For-PSP/dp/B000BNXDBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Unrated Edition) (UMD Mini For PSP)</a>&nbsp;tries to fit in socially with his friends. He listens to Pearl Jam, immerses himself in university life, and socializes with his peers.  Despite all his company, his name causes him great insecurity and some insensitive jokes.  Against his parent's wishes, he changes it to Nick and dates Maxine, an American girl of Northern European descent.  However, changes in his life make him embrace his ancestry more enthusiastically.

Later, he dates an American who shares his Indian heritage only to find this brings complications as well.  When his father's health falters, he finds himself drawing near to his family.  Before his father's health fails, the family goes to India where Gogol discovers the Taj Mahal and the modest residences of relatives in India.  It is only later that he uncovers the real treasures of his thoughtful name and the wisdom of his father's words, ""There are no accidents.""  Gogol must live with all these dichotomies with America his home, but India his family`s tradition--and the family members who are scattered about and affected by life's changes.  How he chooses between whom he dates and where he lives and draws meaning in life is a revelation for us as well.

Sometimes lost in translation, the gentle humor and heartwarming development of the movie is absorbing and varied enough to keep one's interest.  Much like `My Big Fat Greek Wedding'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>&nbsp;before it, `The Namesake' is a heart-felt keepsake.",1196208000,12,2360,5.9
1560309,2,B00005JP60,"While ""The Namesake"" does deliver a strong message about family and identity, the movie is seemingly less than the sum of its parts, and especially less than its underlying message.
While it does have some strong and moving scenes, and scenes that those in similar situations to the characters will know and understand, the movie is often episodic without enough connection made between the scenes. We catch glimpses of their lives, but the filmmaker doesn't quite connect how those scenes affect their lives and understanding as the characters grow older. I'm not asking to be spoonfed the meanings of the scenes (we get enough spoonfeeding of the obvious in  most Hollywood movies), but it often feels we're just jumping from one episode to another with little transition and little reason as to why we saw that moment in their lives. It's like a book of snapshots, one snapshot's done and we quickly move on as if each ""picture"" exists independently of the others.
Even the scene of the father telling his son, Gogol, how he got his name isn't as powerful as it could be. Again, I'm not asking for overdone Hollywood histrionics, but more of a feeling than ""OK, the scene ends here, let's move on...""
It's still worth watching, but if one purchases it, they'll probably be watching more scenes than others to get the heart in this rather softly directed effort.",1195862400,15,1364,4.829059829059829
1560310,4,B00005JP60,"""The Namesake"", directed by Mira Nair (""Mississippi Masala"", ""Monsoon Wedding"") and based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, tells the thoughtful, well-told story of a Bengali family's life in New York. The parents move to the country, try to get acclimated, have children and then try to instill traditional values in them as they grow up and deal with their own difficulties. ""The Namesake"" is a very good film, but it lacks just a little something to make it a great film.

Ashoke (Irfan Khan, star of many Bollywood films) meets Ashima (Tabu) in India. Their parents are very keen on their marriage and both consent to become man and wife; Ashoke is clearly taken by Ashima's beauty and Ashima seems to be intrigued with the idea of living in America. Upon their arrival in New York, Ashoke immediately returns to work, leaving his new wife to acclimate to the new, cold weather surroundings alone. Soon, they have a child, Gogol, named after Ashoke's favorite author, Nikolai Gogol. Then, they have a daughter, Sonia. As the children grow, they become more and more entrenched in the American way of life, eschewing many of the parent's traditional beliefs. After graduating from college, Gogol (Kal Penn, ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"", TV's ""24"") announces he wants to change his name, he can't see Gogol Ganguli on a resume getting him a good job. This causes a rift between father and son, causing discord in their relationship.

Directed by Mira Nair, ""The Namesake"" is a beautiful looking, thoughtful film. If Nair is able to accomplish anything, it is to make her films thoughtful examinations of the challenges her characters face in a new environment, or as they strain against old-fashioned ideas and morals. Her films have concentrated primarily on the experience of Indians, both in India and America, throwing her min characters into a new situation, as they face many challenges. In ""The Namesake"", the story centers on the Ganguli family and it is much different than I originally anticipated.

Watching the trailers, you might get the impression the film is primarily about the struggles of Gogol (Penn), as he deals with life as an Indian in the United States. Actually, his story is just a part of the overall film. The film begins in the 70s, as Ashoke travels on a train, reading a collection of works by Nikolai Gogol. Later, he meets Ashima, they marry, move to America, get to know one another, have children, and much more. The film presents a lot of detail about the lives of this family.

In less capable hands, the film would completely succumb to its `melodramatic' structure, but Nair manages to keep these tendencies at bay, for most of the film. The director makes the characters very real, showing them in very natural situations. This is the history of this family, not merely a slice of life. Because of that, we watch various, representative episodes through the years, in an attempt to get a full picture of the Ganguli family.

Irfan Khan has made about forty films, according to IMDB, and this is the first time I have ever seen him on screen. The majority of his work has been in Bollywood, but with this film, he appears to be branching out and has just completed a role in the Anjelina Jolie film about journalist Daniel Pearl and his wife. Khan is really good as Ashoke. He makes the character seem real by imbuing him with feelings and attitudes that seem real. He almost doesn't appear to be acting; he appears to be pulling thoughts and ideas from his real life to make this character seem more realistic. When he is happy, he smiles slightly, when he is upset, his eyes narrow and he stares at the person he is talking to. He isn't effusive, but realizes he has to protect his family and try to live with their mistakes, even if he disagrees.

Tabu is also very good as Ashima, the Ganguli family matriarch. As soon as she arrives in America, she tries to acclimate, on her own, but finds it too much. When Ashoke realizes this, he becomes much more compassionate, maybe even falls in love with her a little more. As she grows older, and her children grow older, she becomes more of a patriarch, more of a guiding force in her children's lives.

Kal Penn is probably the most recognizable face in the cast. He is good, but he is not a great actor. Penn is capable of delivering the emotions necessary to portray Gogol, the young man torn between tradition and his desire to be a modern American, but he only delivers the one emotion, or thought, never making his character seem real. When Gogol is supposed to be sad, Penn frowns. When he is happy, Penn smiles. There is never anything underneath the surface, never a layer of conflict or a layer of any other emotion than the one he is supposed to portray at that given moment. This makes his performance serviceable, but not much else.

Initially, I thought the film would be primarily about Gogol, which would mean a lot of screen time for Penn. I was surprised to find the film is more of a family portrait, charting the course of this family's journey to America and how they deal with all of their problems. This helps the film because it takes the focus off of Penn and let's the other actors, the better actors, contribute to the success of the film. The other actors are better.

Jacinda Barrett (""Poseidon"", ""School for Scoundrels"") appears as Gogol's American girlfriend. And she is also serviceable. It is easy to see why he would be attracted to her, physically, but she is also a little boring. She is always smiling, a little giggly, which fits her character well. But we never really learn anything about her. At one point, Gogol asks her about her dreams and ambitions. Her replay is ""I don't want to think about it now"".

Nair has a real knack for pulling away the layers, allowing her characters to show their feelings in a natural way. Ashoke is a complicated character, and we see that in just about every scene, every conversation, every action. Nair allows the character to retain their Indian roots and heritage, yet deal with life in America. Throughout the film, the family has traditional celebrations, interacts with the Indian community and through these moments, we get a glimpse of this culture. I am not an expert, but because these moments are so thoughtful, and interesting, I have no doubt they are also realistic as well.

""The Namesake"" is a well-made and thoughtful film, but because of the very reasons it is well made, it is less than great. Because the film covers so much territory, it seems slightly melodramatic, cutting through the film's power like a knife to butter. The scenes are well done and get the message across, but they give the film an episodic structure. There is an overall theme to the film, Gogol accepting his heritage and identity, and there is another layer below that, which I won't reveal, but because the scenes are episodic, they don't allow the story to generate any heat or power, to make it resonate with the viewer. The final moments will move you, I just wish there were more moments like this throughout the film.

As you watch, you will become engrossed in the lives of these characters, then the story shifts, and you have to become familiar with them again, at this new point in their lives. This isn't bad, but these scenes don't always grab us, and demand our attention. After a while, they become a little routine and our attention shifts.

""The Namesake"" is a well-made film, worth your attention, but it is not an incredible film, or a memorable film. You will likely only remember it when you hear about Mira Nair's next film.",1193356800,7,7636,4.68530947054437
1560440,5,B00005JP60,"The Namesake is a beautiful illustration of the struggle a family faces while the parents try to maintain their traditional cultural rituals and norms while their children seem to be more influenced and impressed by Western cultural norms. The clash between the traditional narrow socialization of their native country and the broad socialization found here in America is demonstrated in several instances throughout the film. It is also however, quite a touching, poignant love story about the parents who evolved from an arranged marriage of strangers to a dedicated marriage of soulmates.",1190937600,,591,5.434782608695652
1560441,5,B00005JP60,"I watched this movie recently. It is based on the  'bestseller' novel written by Jhumpa Lahiri that I read a few years back ( Also called THE NAMESAKE). The storyline is very touching as it tries to explore the inner turmoils experienced by an immigrant indian family in US ....especially  as they try to raise their children with their own set of indian traditions and run into conflicts between eastern and western mindset.

Ashima and Ashoke ( the Gangulis), move to the US very early in life. They are both very proud of their new country and its limitless opportunities but at heart they still remain attached to their 'bengali' roots and culture. I guess this is the loneliness of most 'first generation' immigrants - irrespective of whichever country you migrate from.

So the couple consciously try to raise their kids with their bengali  traditions and values. This makes the kids perpetually unsure about their 'true' identity while they try to blend themselves within the american 'melting pot'. Should Gogol follow the typical lifestyle of the average american youth  or should he continue following the indian traditions so dear and near to his loving family??? Gogol grapples with this conundrum throughout his early youth...

As a recent indian immigrant myself I can say that this conflict affects most of our families and it is  difficult for both the parents and kids to understand one another. Eventually many of these ABCD kids grow up to become extremely confused or they become rebels (like in the movie Gogol's is embarrased by his odd-sounding name and blames his parents for this act).

I felt the director Mira Nair handled the entire subject with  a lot of sensitivity and maturity . As Nair explores the psyche of the Gogol Ganguly ..one almost feels sorry for Gogol as he tries to grapple with his own identity vis-a-vis his unspoken yet deep love for his parents.

It was also amazing to see the depth in Nair's research during the  the movie. For example her portrayal of the bengali traditions(arranged marriages, nick names, etc) and  festive 'Kolkata' was both authentic and terrific.

I must say the principal actors Irfan, Tabu and Kal Penn played their roles beautifully. Irfan especially stood out as the Bengali Bhadralok(gentleman). Music composition was also very good. To sum up, I felt this Mira Nair film did full justice to the original novel written by Jhumpa Lahiri.",1189123200,4,2413,4.9405940594059405
1560442,5,B00005JP60,"Having been to India myself, the opening minutes of ""The Namesake"" immediately struck an emotional cord within me. The familiar sights of an over packed train journeying across the sprawling Indian countryside evoked a time of searching. India is a land of great mystery and soul, even for those who call it home.

On this particular train journey, an older man sitting across from a student questions him about the book he reads. The elder man encourages this young student to see the world, not just read about it through books. Then, almost instantaneously, tragedy strikes...then darkness...and silence. As the lovely opening titles ebb and flow before us, with soothing music, a powerful sense of a great journey about to unfold washes over you. It is a rewarding journey, and a very human one.

Adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name, ""The Namesake"" effortlessly ushers us through the life cycle of a Bengali family. The relationship between the spouses, Ashima and Ashoke, is at first a landscape as unfamiliar to them as is New York, where Ashima joins her newly married husband after their arranged marriage in India. The Pulitzer Prize winning author of ""The Namesake"" Jhumpa Lahiri, has fashioned a beautiful example of two people very much in love with one another who never fail to respect their individuality in their union. This is poignantly displayed in a scene where, Ashima, in an effort to please her husband, has accidentally shrunk his sweaters in the dryer. She isolates herself in the bathroom, in tears at her husbands frustration. Ashoke is quick to recognize his shortcoming acknowledging to her through the closed bathroom door that her intention was good, and that it was his fault for not telling her she did not need to do the laundry. He also offers to make her some tea. She is surprised at how untraditional he is in his expectations of her.

Two children follow and the focus soon settles on the eldest, Gogol, a name given him after his father's favorite author and one we learn has extra special meaning as the film plays out. Gogol is a typical youth, struggling to find his own identity outside of the one fashioned for him by his parents and the traditions they raised him with. We follow him from boyhood to manhood and experience the pain that comes with moving forward and the doubt that comes from what we've ignored in the process. Yet even though our gaze follows Gogol, we are given a balanced experience of everyone's journey. Ashima is a striking example of a woman in touch with the cycles of life and surrendering to the meaningful nature of its many seasons. Ashoke is a silent pillar of strength and wisdom, loving his son despite of the distance Gogol prefers. But for as much distance as Gogol creates through his interest in his American girlfriend's family, he is pulled back to his roots and eventually succumbs, unaware, to the preferences of his family tradition, only to lose it. But as is true in life, we must lose it, to find it.

""The Namesake"" is a full circle tale about finding ones home in the world, after many journeys away from our own back yard. It's about ultimately coming to accept and being thankful for the longings of our heart, and the many journeys it can take us on in life. - Thomas O'Connor",1188432000,,3287,4.741258741258742
1560443,4,B00005JP60,"Based on the novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, ""The Namesake"" on the surface is a story of  culture clash, but on a deeper level it's just a story about growing up. Gogol Ganguli is an Indian boy who is racing as fast as he can to escape his parents and his Bengali heritage. After getting through his obnoxious teenager stage, he goes to Yale and takes up with an almost impossibly WASP girl and her family. It's only upon his father's death that he realizes how much he loved him, but then he runs in the other direction and marries a Bengali girl who nevertheless shares none of his values.  In the end he's off to ""find himself,"" traveling through India and really seeing it for the first time.

Much more interesting here is the story of Gogol's parents, especially his mother, and the story of their arranged marriage. And the tale of Ashok, Gogol's father, and how he came to give Gogol his odd name, is quite moving.

Although an interesting film, with beautiful insights into Hindu culture, I had the same problem with the movie as I did with the book--we never fully understand the Gogol character, with his abrupt shifts back and forth.  Lahiri came to our attention with her Pulitzer-prize winning collection of short stories, which were truly wonderful, but I don't think she's mastered the novel form, and the trick of watching a character evolve. By filling in more details of Gogol's childhood, the film struggles to overcome this with only partial success.

Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film to watch, especially if you've ever been to India, and the story of immigrants adapting to a new culture is compelling. The film makes us really feel how inhospitable, cold and lonely the ""outer boroughs"" of NYC must have felt to a young girl whose first plane trip took her to the United States. Hot and cold running water and gas 24 hours a day, as her husband proudly explains, hardly began to make up for the life she left behind. But Ashima grows into a lovely and mature woman, who is free at the end to choose her life for the first time. Hers is the interesting story.",1187049600,3,2080,4.577956989247312
1560444,5,B00005JP60,"This movie deals with Bengali culture in India and families both in their native lands and abroad - and I have to say is one of the most satisfying and beautiful watches I had the pleasure of sitting down to. To an Irishman of 49 and typical multiplex type, I'd admit that most of the cast is unrecognizable to me, but that makes no odds, because all are uniformly superb. And I love the insights the film gives into a culture as fascinating as theirs.

It begins in 1977 when a young Bengali man (who has been to study in the USA since 1974) is back in his native Calcutta to meet his new bride - one that is picked out for him whether he likes her or not. He is Ashoke, an engineer with prospects - played subtly and gently by a fantastic Irrfan Khan. Ashoke gets real lucky - his bride is the quietly beautiful Ashima (it means limitless, played by the gorgeous Bollywood star Tabu). Waiting with her parents, Ashoke looks uncomfortable but resigned - its been done this way for centuries. Before Ashima goes into the room to see him for the first time - she tries on his American shoes he's left outside the room - they fit and she likes them - a good sign. Ashima takes them off and meekly enters - ultra respect to her elders. Ashoke is not traditionally handsome, but his big soppy bug-eyes and equally studious glasses tell you that this is a good man - and an intelligent one. They marry in full traditional dress and custom. Ashima waves her family goodbye at the airport and then on to New York.

Life in America is foreign to her, but she adapts. Besides, something else is happening that makes it all bearable; Ashima is slowly but surely falling in love with her 'chosen' husband. It's in these scenes that the film shows it true charm - it's so beautifully and realistically handled (many scenes returned to later in flashback to flesh out dialogue that is important and pivitol to the story). Their relationship is an evolving love, away from need and initial awkwardness into a mutual respect for each other. The believability of the two lead actors here is crucial - and you can feel their drawing together - year after year after year.

The story continues to both of their kids being born (a boy and a girl), then young, then grown up and full of New Yawk attitude and difficulty with the 'old ways' - even with their names. 1st born - and most rebellious - the boy's name is Gogol (played by Kal Penn), which he hates with a passion until he finds out why his father called him that (a train journey and a passenger who changed his life). Gogol and his sister's dual identities cause them both conflict and even heartache. They endure racism, work, snobbery, meet potential partners, they marry - and on it goes - to sad and joyful surprises as their life journey progresses. It's set across 25 years and there's a lot crammed in. (Gogul's sister Sonia is played by Sahira Nair)

The Namesake is as much about Indian culture (then and now) as it is about the power and pull of family - that one thing that unites us all with love and misery in equal measure! I can't recommend this movie enough - in my Top 20 with a bullet. A gentle and beautiful surprise I heartily recommend.

P.S.: Like Gustavo Santaolalla's music in ""The Motorcycle Diaries""  and ""Babel"", Nitin Sawhney's music is one of the reasons the movie has such slow and majestic power - an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack - and one I'm going to buy pronto!

P.P.S.: The title of this review is from the dedication in the credits by the director Mira Nair.",1186963200,82,3538,4.450617283950617
1560445,4,B00005JP60,"I was fortunate enough to see this film at theater and was it ever worth it! Director Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) does a terrific job of adding color and warmth that really begins to draw in the viewing audience. Based off of the novel (The Namesake) by Jjumpa Lahiri, the film follows a multi-generational story as a couple from India movie to America to begin their life and finally the audience watches their first generation American born children traverse their lives. When the film followed the parent's romance and relationship it was always touching and beautiful bur the only reason I hesitate to give this film five stars is due to the later half of the movie. Following the children's lives quickly became generic (whether this is attributed to the book and/or the movie I don't know). I appreciated the dislike that was cultivated towards the son but it began to become so predictable - I definitely left the theater with a bit of a bittersweet feeling.",1186444800,,965,4.7844311377245505

1560447,5,B00005JP60,"As much as I liked Jhumpa Lahiri's novel, Mira Nair's film adaptation of it is even better in my opinion.  Lahiri's novel is written at times in the matter of a ""just the facts"" accounting.  Nair, however, has succeeded in unearthing the emotional high points of the book and staging them in stirring fashion.  Two scenes stand out in particular: the drama of the opening train scene and the interaction between passangers Ashoke and Ghosh are a heart-stopping beginning to the film; and the scene in which Ashoke finally reveals to Gogol the symbolic relevance of his name raises goose-bumps even thinking about it.  Great stuff from Mira Nair.  Between this work and 'Monsoon Wedding,' she's created two of my favorites.

The film's real revelation is the acting ability of Kal Penn.  Previously known and typecast only for stoner-like roles, Nair took a flyer here on Penn and came up a winner.  He's brilliant.  He pretty much has to be, as he's in just about every scene.  Irfan Khan and Tabu are also fantastic as parents Ashoke and Ashima.  I love how Ms. Nair is able to pick actors from the US and Bollywood film worlds and make them work as a family.",1182470400,5,1160,4.665024630541872
1560448,5,B00005JP60,"I watched this movie together with my girlfriend who is indian. Both of us agreed that this move excellently discribes the situation many expatriots find them selves in. The struggle of taking on a new identity while not loosing your own is captured really well. We see that it is really hard to call anyone the villan in this movie, as it is with expatriots and third culture kids so often. There is no definite right and wrong but a battle of priorities defined by cultures. I was challanged and encouraged by this movie. It opened my eyes and forced me to look beyond my own worldview and transported me into that of someone else.

We liked the move so much that emediately after watching it we bought tickets for my parents who felt the same as us after watching it. It enspired them, challanged them and showed them the value as well as the problems diversity brings.

The movie is a must see for all those interested in other cultures, crosscultural relationships, or just want to get a better understanding of the neighbour from another country thyat lives down the road",1181001600,3,1077,4.604166666666667

I saw it last night on a JetBlue flight. What a wonderful film. I was moved. I cried many times! I came here as a grad student in 1984, and so much of the film was so real, and so incredibly well-rendered -- the acting, the characters, the Indian locales, the US Indian experience.

I highly recommend the film. It is great cinema - and though not necessary as a comparison - is right up there with the best that Ray has made.  Please see this if you want to see a wonderful film, enjoy good film-making, or just want to learn more about India and the Indian immigrant experience.",1181001600,13,771,4.1610738255033555

Nair turns a very 'literary' internal book into a beautiful visual narrative.

Though brief the scene at the Taj Mahal is wonderful and one of the best depictions of the place I have seen on film - I've seen it in person - and it felt like i was back there for a moment.

1560527,3,B00005JP60,"Jhumpa Lahiri's international bestseller's screen adaptation, Namesake though not in the same league as the book, is a compelling work of art in its own rights. Though not significantly altered from the novel, the movie's script provides a distinctly different treatment to the way characters are depicted. As a consequence, Namesake the movie, is in many ways is more of a depiction of the life and experiences of Ashima Ganguli than that of Gogol Ganguli (the person who is meant to be the Namesake). Nonetheless, the movie is an insightful portrayal of a lifecycle of an immigrant family - including some brilliant scenes and some tender moments of exquisite emotional glory.

The acting of Tabu (as Ashima Ganguli) and Irfan Khan (as Ashok Ganguli) is of a very high standard.  Their comfort in the role of immigrant parents is numbingly realistic. Irfan Khan stands out for bringing a typical immigrant father's character almost live to the screen. He is aware of his children's needs for different perspectives and practices than his own, but at the same time he is uncomfortable at their departure from values he holds dearest to his heart. In her portrayal of an immigrant Indian wife and mother, Tabu has attained excellence in her typical style.

Along with these outstanding characters, coexists a characterization that is less appealing than you would expect from a Mira Nair movie's protagonist. Gogol Ganguli's dilemmas and struggle for an identity have been dealt with in rather brief scenes, and the themes have not emerged well. That is why his reasons for refusing a girl with whom he was happy, and instead loving and marrying a girl, who eventually hurt him, are obvious only if you have an immigrant perspective. That is why the concluding scenes of the movie do not seem consistent with his character - it seems that the pursuer of an American value system in him concedes to his racial roots, but the transition is rather sudden, even mildly abrupt. The enigma around his characterization is the biggest drawback of the movie. After all, the Namesake - Gogol Ganguli - is expected to rise above the rest and convey a bit more.",1179187200,21,2149,4.914600550964187
1560528,4,B00005JP60,"In 2003 I read this very interesting novel.  I really loved it.  It seemed to totally encompass the immigrant experience.  It was simple and I liked that.  And it was forthright and to the point.  That's why I was anxious to see the film.  I was a little disappointed.  This is not a bad film.  I just thought the filmmaker could have done better.  Perhaps that was because I knew the story and there were no surprises. Or maybe it was because now, in 2007, I've read and heard and viewed so many stories about immigrants that ""The Namesake - The Movie "" has somehow lost its uniqueness for me.  That said, this was a good film and contains a story that it is important to tell.

In The Namesake, we first meet a young man who is in a train wreck. His life has been saved because of the book he was reading by the author Gogol.  He recovers from his injuries but his life has changed forever.  He wants to go out into the world and explore.  That's why he chooses to go to college in America.  He does well and comes back to India to take a bride.  Even though it is an arranged marriage there is defiantly a connection between the couple.  They marry and go to America where at first it is difficult for the wife.  But they soon have a son, who they name ""Gogol"", and later they have a daughter.  They prosper.  Their children grow up.  Their son falls in love with an American girl.  The parents are upset.  And then, after a tragedy, the son returns to his roots and marries a very modern Indian girl.  But this marriage does not end ""happily ever after"".  Eventually, there is a turning point and everyone makes mature decisions.  Life goes on.

The family's adjustment to life in America takes different shapes and forms seen in broken relationships, friendships, and lovers.

As the movie progressed I found myself empathizing with each character in a way I haven't done since Crash.  I miss movies that draw you into the narrative and then at the end bring you to a sense of closure.  One of the strongest roles played in the movie was by Tabu (the mom).  She starts out as a naive house wife who is struggling to adapt to life in America.  As her life moves on she learns to become strong partly because she has no other choice.  It is very hard to capture the silent moments in life.  This movie did just that.  For that reason and so much more I am convinced this film is one of the best of 2007.

Their son, named Gogol, grows into a smart but slightly rebellious teen-ager who often feels stiflied by his parent's focus on tradition and family unity.

The movie ends with Gogol's mother deciding to sell the family home in America and return to India.

My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes set in India. I spent 4 months travelling there as a college student and the film does a great job of capturing the country in all it's intense, colorful and bustling glory. As in several of her previous movies, director Mira Nair is interested in exploring how Indians are affected by modernization and Western influence while still trying to maintain their own traditions and sense of cultural authenticity. The movie is rather slow paced and with a serious tone. Personally I preferred Nair's more celebratory and humor filled past movies such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Mississippi Masala"". But ""The Namesake"" is still an interesting and worthwhile film, especially for those interested in life in India or the experience of Indians in America.",1175299200,8,1630,4.992647058823529
1560531,3,B00005JP60,"Based on the 2003 novel by US author Jhumpa Lahiri, her fifth book, Namesake is the sixteenth film from director Mira Nair and it is one of her best.

There is considerable tension in the film, which is first about a young Indian couple (Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli, played by Indian actors Irfan Khan and Tabu) who have an arranged marriage and then move to the New York to begin a new life. Secondly, it's mainly about their first child, their son Gogol and his struggles to live his life both to please his parents and to please himself.

Symbolic of the cultural confusions the son faces is the fact that his name, Gogol, was hastily chosen for his birth certificate, rather than wait for this grandparent's arrival from India to help select it, months later.

While away at school, he begins a relationship with a beautiful white woman and is practically accepted as a member of her family.  Meanwhile, his mother laments the fact that her son prefers to spend holiday time with a family other than his own.

The film has it's sweet, cute moments, but the overall tone is one of struggle without idealistic endings.  We see birth, loneliness, death and it's all wrapped up in the competition to adhere to one's traditions while seeking acceptance in society at large.  This is most poignantly shown when the girlfriend seeks to comfort Gogol by sticking with him but he rejects her ovations that would seem perfectly normal to most western-raised people.

Before our hero Gogol, played by Kal Penn, best known for the stoner film Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, heads off to college, we see him meet a family who have recently arrived from England, including their daughter (played by Zuleikha Robinson, perhaps best known for guest starring in the X-Files spin off, The Lone Gunmen),who is same age as him but who looks very much like ""Ugly Betty"" and has a snooty personality to match her looks.  Of course, she shows up later as an incredible hottie who gets intwinned into Gogol's life in a big way.

The theme of cultural confusion, struggle and the triumph over adversity could have been better demonstrated.  I haven't read the book so I don't know how true the film is to it.  Without a doubt, there are tens of thousands of people whose lives have paralleled that of the Ganguli family, by arriving in the ""west"" and doing the best that they can to give their children a better life than they had in the ""old country.""  The price to pay for such prosperity, however, is having your children slip away from the traditional roots that you have laid down for them.  It's not so bad for them that they find their own way when they head off for college and university, but growing up different from the other kids can have devastating consequences, in some cases.

I can't fault the acting of the anyone in the Ganguli family.  It's first rate and believable.  The film's potential wasn't fully realized due to the story not being stretched out, to further show the struggles and triumphs.

It's interesting to note that the film's star, Kal Penn, changed his name from Kalpen Modi, to make himself more marketable, much like the character he plays in the film.  From watching the previews, however, I was under the impression that the name he wanted to change was the family's last name and not his first name.

My rating for this film is 3.5/5.",1175212800,,3358,4.640202702702703
1560532,5,B00005JP60,"Films with universal themes run great risks. Mostly this risk entails descending into that pit known as cliche. Many films have done it and fallen victim, but THE NAMESAKE uses its universal theme to great advantage, never disguising what it is and how important it can be.

The theme is family and how vital they are to our core existence. They shape every part of us, from childhood on, for better or worse. They create a sense of belonging, even when we're apart, even when separated by oceans. They give us our early identity, and even our names.

Most of us don't think about how tough it is to name a human being and how we lug that title around with us for the rest of our lives. But in The Namesake, director Mira Nair ( of MONSOON WEDDING fame) gives us Gogol Ganguli, a name of substance and importance, but not necessarily important to its owner.

The Namesake is a tri-generational story of a Bangladeshi family. The film starts with the beautiful Indian singing of Ashima (Tabu). Her initial goal in life is to become a great artist/singer. But family concerns override her plans as she returns home to find a marriage arrangement being put forth for her. Her parents introduce her to her future husband, Ashoke (Irfan Khan), an architect who's been studying and living in America. The marriage takes place and Ashima accompanies her new husband to New York (""Half a world away""). She immediately begins missing her family but her forlorn attitude is whisked aside as Ashoke teaches her the ways of the City. She becomes pregnant with her first child, Gogol. The naming is tricky because normally it is done by an elder from within the family (all of whom are still in India). So Ashoke names him after one of his favorite authors (Nicholas ""Gogol"", a famous Russian writer). Gogol bares the name with disdain, never fully realizing its importance (one of Nicholas Gogol's books actually saved Gogol's father's life after a fatal train accident in India many years before). Gogol eventually changes his name to Nick, thus ending his family's tradition of keeping an appropriate Indian name.

It is this Americanization that is most troubling throughout the film. It invades the very fabric of what Gogol's family represents. Although not entirely without merit (America does give him a good education and a nice job), the culture of his parents seems stilted and uncool. As Gogol (and eventually his sister) grow into adulthood, they search for love in America, and find it via Americans. This is also another blow to Ashima and Ashoke (Gogol's mother and father). Americans live in the fast lane and often have to choose between one spouse's family over the other. This comes into sharp contrast as Gogol begins dating a beautiful blonde American named Maxine (Jacinda Barrett, POSEIDON). Maxine's pull is strong and forces Gogol to drift farther away from his roots. His parents call and call but never hear back. It takes a devastating family event to get Gogol back on track and it is this that gives the film its emotional heft. Tear-jerking and non-forced, this event was played perfectly and surprised everyone in the audience (all the movie patrons gasped around me when it occurred, a true tribute to this film's masterful weaving of the family theme).

The movie's arc is also well done. It ends just as it begins, with the focus on understanding family and what it means to move on when the time comes, but to never forget where you've come from.",1175040000,14,3470,4.786310517529215
1560533,4,B00005JP60,"Director Mira Nair's The Namesake (based on the novel) is the story of a Bengali family's journey through life in New York after emigrating from India. Their son Gogol (Kal Penn) is caught in a culture gap between his parents' old traditions of India and the clashing modern ways of the United States.

I have to admit I didn't know much about Indian culture prior to seeing this film; not the way I knew about the Japanese, the Chinese, the French, and Italians, anyway. It was easy to relate to the family's alienation and feelings of loneliness. On top of the generation gap between their parents and them, Gogol (whose father named after Russian writer Nikolai Gogol) and his sister Sonia struggle to understand their parents' take on life. The film skillfully deals with life's most important issues and stays in touch with the essence of the characters. The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are heartfelt. Kal Penn sheds his stoner image from Harold and Kumar to deliver his most poignant performance to date. The film does tend to drag a bit in certain places, but the overall experience is an enjoyable one.

Well written characters and script, great actors, and a talented director make this one a must-see for aficionados of foreign and art-house films. If you've always wondered what it's like to come from a different country and be immersed in a society such as America, then see this film. It's not a film meant for the mass audiences, but it achieves what it set out to do.",1175040000,33,1504,4.758620689655173
1560534,5,B00005JP60,"THE NAMESAKE, a beautiful film about the delicate ties and tensions between family, culture and identity, is beautifully brought to the screen by the great Indian director, Mira Nair.  This story, adapted from a novel, has moments of warm and infectious humor, as well as intense scenes of cultural displacement and alienation.  What is especially compelling is the running theme and great significance paid to the Indian custom of one's nickname and ""good name"" (AKA the name with which most of the world addresses you).  This subject ties into other aspects of the struggle to assimilate and come to know one's self in a culture quite alien and unfamiliar, and is beautifully illustrated in the relationships between East and West, conveyed in the film.

Ashoke Ganguli (soulfully played by Irfan Khan) is a young electrical engineer, who returns home to India, to meet and be married to beautiful Ashima (Tabu).  Together, they make their home in Queens, New York, which provides great culture shock for Ashima, who has never been away from India before, and must adjust to the cold climate and unlimited supply of gas powered heating, in their modest apartment.  Soon, their family begins to grow, with the arrival of their son, Gogol (Kal Penn) and daughter, Sonia (Sahira Nair).  ""Gogol"" is their son's nickname, while Nikhil is his, more formal, good name.  Gogol sticks with his nickname, in spite of the merciless teasing he endures in school, and doesn't take on the name ""Nikhil"" or ""Nick,"" until he is out of high school.  This name change is a significant change for the young man, torn between his Westernized self identity, and the Indian identity of his parents.  On the way, he searches for his true identity, independent of his parents and the life he knew before, in his relationship with his White girlfriend, Maxine (Jacinda Barrett), and then his Bengali girlfriend, Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson).

Mira Nair does a fantastic job telling this complex and engaging story.  I particularly took notice of (and loved) her attention to distinctive cinematography, in the scenes shot in the United States, versus India.  While we see rich colors and flowing light, while the family is on holiday there for the summer, the sky and surroundings are grey and dismal once the Gangulis' have settled in Queens.  The color distinctions were poetry for the eyes........Also, the acting was superb.  Tabu, who is well-known in India as a respected Bollywood actress, is glowing, sensitive and beautiful here.  The rest of the cast was equally strong and believable.  Not to be missed!",1174953600,4,2591,5.030444964871195
1560535,5,B00005JP60,"Well she has done it again-Mira Nair has yet brought to the screen another winning,beautiful and lyrical tale that brings great satisfaction. This time Nair has brought us the adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, THE NAMESAKE.While this story may seem familiar in other forms,it has the universally identifiable themes of family and  tradition vs assimililation into another culture-this time Indian style! Nair takes us from Calcutta to New York following two generations of the Ganguli family and their struggle to remain Indian and yet at the same time be American. The three characters that remain at the heart of the story are the two parents and their son,Gogol. Each character is fully developed and each has a definite epiphany about where they are headed in life. This film is definite Oscar material and can be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone. The pacing,like the novel,is slow and deliberate,yet not at all plodding. The story builds to the proper climax and the viewer will be carried along and will be caught up in this wonderful,absorbing story. Again....another hit for Mira Nair!",1174867200,4,1103,5.127777777777778

7941526,5,B00005JP60,"This movie completely immerses you into the lifestyle and colors of the Bengal religion. It is well shown through the striking comparisons between the U.S. and Indian values. It brings up conflicts in assimilation, and the culture shock that the migrating parents feel, but their children do not. We are shown the customs integral to their life. The songs and sayings, the imposed responsibilities on a Bengali Hindu housewife, and how they deal with life and death. In the ritual of birth, the Child is presented a plate of offerings which is thought to determine their luck in life depending what object they choose from the plate. In death, the men shave their heads and they send their ashes off in the Ganges River in India. The most beautiful and somewhat strange set up is marriage. Bright colors and festive people all celebrating a wedding between two people who have just barely met, or were set up by their parents. In almost all actions in life, their religion affected everything, something that Gogol did not easily embrace in the life around him, but that he learned he was a part of and loved.

The Namesake begins with the story of Gogols parents, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli. Ashoke thought nothing of traveling and leaving the comfort of a book, but after a devastating train crash, he took the last words of a passenger and traveled to America. He was then set up with Ashima, a girl who spent her whole life in India but came with Ashoke to live a new life as his bride. As their family grows, they and their children have trouble handling their Indian culture and the American one around them. All grown up, their son Gogol almost tries to forget his heritage and has a very strong displeasure for his name. Once his father explains the reason for his name  the name of the Author that he was reading in the train crash  he feels a sense of shame and disappointment in himself. This is magnified with his fathers death and sends him into action to appreciate his family once again and come back to his culture.",1523145600,,2030,4.617728531855955
7941527,3,B00005JP60,"The Namesake follows a first generation Indian family that moves to New York so their kid can grow up in America. Gogol (their son) takes advantage of growing up in America turning into a pot smoking teenager.  After a summer trip to India before starting college at Yale, Gogol starts opening up to his culture and becomes more accepting of it. After college he gets a good job and falls in love with a wealthy white woman who does not fully grasp cultural differences and what a big deal they can be to some people and his parents disapprove of her because of this. Gogol feels closer to her parents who are more open then he does to his own who are guarded. After a tragic event in his family he rekindles with his religion and customs and through this encounters romantic difficulties. This movie is very close to the religion they focus on it shows the worship and praying to deities and the customs they follow, like Gogol telling that they can not touch or kiss yet because it goes against his religion. The prayers they use relate to religion and the family essence brings about a sense of culture. We see it in the stories that are told to their children and how it is difficult for a first generation family to adjust to life in a new world. It excellently displays the partial judgement and misunderstandings of cultural judgement and how sometimes we never reach acceptance for how we are. This was a decent movie and it helped to show a new side to a religion that may not always have attention brought to it.",1523145600,,1522,4.474820143884892

7941529,4,B00005JP60,"This was really good.  It's quite the journey of Indian immigrants and their American-born children.  We see how the parents adjust to American life and then how the children grow up American and lose touch with their Indian culture to some degree.  The focus is on the son who grows up disconnected from his culture and then rediscovers his heritage and Indian identity.  It's funny, happy, sad... full of life.  A true immigrant's story.

There's a pot smoking scene, some nudity (female's rear end) and some sensual bed scenes that imply sex.",1520640000,,545,4.869565217391305

7941534,4,B00005JP60,"This movie really outlines the struggle that a person from another country and culture can have when they move to America. Ahima, the mother of Gogol married her husband and moved to America with him. She and her husband has Gogol and his sister and raised them around tradition Indian traditions. As Gogol and his sister were growing up the didn't really catch on to the whole Indian lifestyle and they were more Americanized than their parents. The movie really showed me how the Hindu lifestyle is and how difficult It can be in a completely different culture. Gogol found a love interest in an American girl which does not go with tradition Indian practices. Usually Indians are set up to marry another Indian by their parents, they don't get to choose. That relationship fell off when Gogols Dad died of a massive heart attack and he ended up with an Indian girl. Later on the Indian girl ended up having an affair with a man that she met in France. The movie outlines the families struggle to stay together in America and ends up with the family back together and the mother going back to India to pursue her singing career.",1510444800,,1130,4.599009900990099
