8395766,4,B003F185JE,"This is a remarkably well made and well acted film of Chekov's great play. I saw it 25 years ago at university and have been checking periodically for years for a DVD with English subtitles to be released (the acting is classic, great russian; exactly in the style that the play was written for- so much of it is done with a side glance, an offhand gesture, a shadowed face- the viewer does not need to understand what is being said in order to tell that an excellent performance is being given). I've never quite understood the director's choice to switch between B&W and Color stock- I have assumed it to be a Brechtian technique- but I cannot find anything but praise for the rest of the way he 'shows' us the story, or rather, the subtext of the story. I only wish they had used a better print and new, easier to read titling. We have gotten used to cleaner prints and more legible subtitles over the past 20 years but I am just GRATEFUL that it is available!! These technical details about the print are the only reason the film does not get my top rating. The film itself is an exceptionally cinematic translation of a great stage play.",1370476800,,1142,4.4170616113744074
8395767,3,B003F185JE,"I was looking forward to this film because it's a Chekov play adapted
to the screen AND Franchot Tone is in it.  The problem is it does
not have subtitles and the dialogue is very hard to understand.  Tone is wonderful
--to bad I can't understand most of what he says.  It's in English. Let me be clear--it's
a wonderful adaptation, except for the soundtrack,which may be from a inferior copy.",1327536000,3,393,4.507042253521127
8395768,4,B003F185JE,"Continental Distributing presents ""UNCLE VANYA"" (1957) (98 min/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- This American film adaptation of the play Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekhov is right on the money with cast and direction. --- Take note this was filmed concurrently with the Off Broadway production, it was both co-produced and co-directed by actor Franchot Tone, who starred as Dr. Astroff --- Tone's wife at the time, Delores Dorn-Heft, co-starred as Elena Andreevna, she was not in the stage version in New York, where the part was played by Signe Hasso --- The title role is played by George Voskovec who completely embraces the character during the entire performance --- This VCI release is above average and totally a good view.
