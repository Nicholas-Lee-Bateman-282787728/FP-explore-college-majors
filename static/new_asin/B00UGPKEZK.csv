8705655,4,B00UGPKEZK,"Lt. Ward Stewart (Tyrone Power) is in love with PT boasts he can drop depth charges on sneaky German U-boats that use lifeboats as ship bait. His Uncle Adm. Bob Stewart (Minor Watson) needs an exec on a U.S. Sub and talks him into doing his duty.

Meanwhile the sub commander Dewey Connors (Dana Andrews) is waiting for one more stripe so he can be worthy of popping the question of marriage to his girl, Jean Hewlett (Anne Baxter, `Nefretiri' in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956).)

You guessed it while Dewey is away Bob discovers Jean and beats him to the question. Jean says sure; she just forgot to tell ether of the men about the other.

One of the interesting things about this movie is that instead of good guy - bad guy, both officers are good guys and it takes both personalities to accomplish the missions.

They do go out of their way to make the Germans sneaky and do extraordinary feats with their sub and commandos.",1525737600,,926,4.494047619047619
