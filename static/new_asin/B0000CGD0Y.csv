7999489,1,B0000CGD0Y,"The little cartoon is probably very cute, but I am giving it one star since it is REGION 2 and we cannot play it.  It was NOT listed as Region 2 ... in fact, looking at the description, there is no region listed at all, unless the ""ASIN"" with the long number is some kind of code that I do not understand.  It was purchased in August as a November birthday gift for a grandchild, so it was just recently given.  Now we are out almost $20 as it is now past the time to be able to return it.  I am always careful to check the Region on DVDs, but  as I stated there was no Region listed in the product details on this one.  Live and learn.  PLEASE ""RED TAG MARKET"" .... update the information on this DVD so no one else makes this same costly mistake !!!!!!!!",1384041600,3,756,4.0
