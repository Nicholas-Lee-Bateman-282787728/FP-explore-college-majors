8258105,5,B0015DK43Y,"My wife and I purchased this incredible film before the arrival of our first born. Wow. I feel like my eyes are open! This film is more of a work of art! So interesting and amazing, the life of the unborn human baby... Makes you seriously consider the little life at stake. Would highly recommend to anyone, especially some who is pregnant.",1475020800,3,340,4.5
8258106,5,B0015DK43Y,"Great video, very informative. I learned some new things. I can't watch it now because prenatal development stuff is making my morning sickness worse. I am avoiding eye contact with the cover picture while typing this.",1467331200,2,218,5.083333333333333
8258107,5,B0015DK43Y,Shows detailed video of every stage of developement.  Heartbeat at 22 days...etc.  Who would of thought that a human in the womb is so...HUMAN!,1394409600,3,143,4.916666666666667
8258108,4,B0015DK43Y,"This DVD was released in 2006. It's 42 minutes long. It covers human prenatal development through all 38 weeks of pregnancy. The information is interesting but the graphic is mostly 2D computer generated. Therefore it's a good supplement to another set of DVD titled ""Human Body - National Geographic Classics"". That one contains 3 discs. The second disc is titled ""In the womb"" which covers the development of the fetus with 3D-scanning video.",1360454400,10,444,5.095890410958904
8258109,5,B0015DK43Y,"I bought this to use at the Pregnancy Resource Center where I am Executive Director. We want all of our clients to see with their own eyes life FROM CONCEPTION is a miracle. With this DVD we have the capability to choose the section that shows the development of each stage of a baby's development. For instance, we can choose week 7 if that's how far along a client is and she is able to see an actual baby at the same stage as her own. It's amazing, and even those of us who have seen this a number of times, still get teary. Our clients LOVE seeing this.
Better to show the truth of fetal development to defend life when we have a  mom who's facing an unexpected pregnancy. We want her to realize at 42 days her baby's heart is beating and there are detectable brain waves. That baby is most assuredly a human life that just needs time and protection to grow.",1276300800,15,862,4.224242424242425
8258110,5,B0015DK43Y,"I bought this for my son & his wife who are expecting their first child. It is truly a window to the womb!  Using the latest technology--computer graphics, ultrasound, embryoscopy, and 4D ultrasound images, the monthly milestones of fetal development are very clearly presented. A wonderful documentary!",1263686400,13,303,5.446808510638298
8258111,5,B0015DK43Y,"WOW, This is great, another visual against ABORTION.
