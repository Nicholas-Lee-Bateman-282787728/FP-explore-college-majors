8505097,3,B006VTZ7HU,"This video has fabulous demonstrations of Nevzorov and horse working together in dressage moves and tricks, mounted and on the ground. Nevzorov convinces us that dressage can somehow be taught from the ground, and certainly convinces us that a horse might be willing to cooperate without being beaten, that dressage should not require spurs or bits.

The video leaves us yearning to do this ourselves... but Nevzorov doesn't give us a clue about how we might do this.  Maybe making those videos is a job for the Parellis, if only they could do what Nevzorov can do.",1414713600,6,565,4.814432989690721
8505098,5,B006VTZ7HU,"It's impossible to remember how many times have I watched this film - during every watching I find out something new and it is reeealy helpful in my lessons with my horse. Alexander shows that work with a horse without any tools of coercion is possible - and it really is, moreover, it is many times more effective than ""traditional"" way to ""teach"" with iron in mouth and non-stop beating.",1400112000,2,389,4.571428571428571
8505099,5,B006VTZ7HU,"This is an inspiring view of what a master horseman can do!
Much to be learned about the horse and human relationship
I recommend this for anyone who aspires to be the best at what they do..",1394582400,5,190,4.162162162162162
8505100,5,B006VTZ7HU,"In this concise presentation Alexander Nevzorov demonstrates the principles of his method of educating a horse.  From the outset he informs you that it is not an educational film in the sense of being a systematic how - to, but instead that it is a description of the fundamental rules of engagement between a human teacher and an equine pupil.

Nevzorov has achieved his results without the use of any equipment of restraint or force, and without the use of punishment of any kind. Remarkably, with just the knowledge of equine anatomy and biomechanics and, of course, acknowledgement of the horse's intelligence and ability to manage its own body, Alexander Nevzorov has been able to encourage and guide his horses to execute difficult maneuvers of strength and poise.

The Haute Ecole or High School movements are refined versions of quite natural movements of horses and their purpose is not only to provide a manner of expression of pride and mastery for the horse, but has the side effect of healthy physical development.  In addition, for the human teacher to orchestrate such a program the stage is set for true and free communication between species, which is the ultimate message from Nevzorov Haute Ecole (NHE).

In this film it is made clear that composure is a paramount possession of the teacher along with softness. Discipline, in the sense of self-discipline or focus, is also imperative for both human and horse. There are plenty of ""wow"" moments, such as when a horse is in recess and allowed to play wildly around its teacher during the important breaks between lessons and yet, amazingly, it comes to attention at the simple raising of a hand.

Nevzorov makes it all look easy, but the film case notes warn viewers that anyone interested in trying this should not proceed without through knowledge of the School.  Fortunately, this film is just one of many resources from NHE.  It is a fine companion piece to Nevzorov's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Horse-Crucified-and-Risen/dp/1463752156/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Horse Crucified and Risen</a>",1327449600,11,2126,5.306547619047619
8505101,5,B006VTZ7HU,"Although this movie refers to the early years of the well-known Russian School of horsemanship Nevzorov Haute Ecole, it is still the must-see thing. Beautiful, powerful free horses are dancing with their two-legged teacher without any bridles, bits or spurs. This movie shows the basic principles of horse education in the NHE. Something no one had ever done before. There are no analogies, nothing to compare it with. All the horses are trained without bits and halters unlike a lot of circus horses who are ridden in a classic way and bits are removed only for the show. This is the whole new level of communication with a horse, of understanding him and listening to him. Anyone with enough love and passion towards horses will find himself at least pondering on throwing away all the bridles right away. And the bravest and the smartest ones will surely do it. Why use all those pain-inflicting tools if the real communication is possible without anything restricting a horse from being a horse?",1326931200,10,999,4.882352941176471
8505102,5,B006VTZ7HU,I am fond of what this man is doing with horses. Its absolutely new way in horsemanship. I recently have read his book and it influenced me much. But this film transforms everything. I am happy to know and to see unbridled and absolutely free horses. You even can't believe this is true. But this is true. For all horse owners and real horse lovers I highly recommend this video.,1326931200,12,379,4.428571428571429
