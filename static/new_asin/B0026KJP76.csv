3854208,5,B0026KJP76,"House In Haunted Hill is the first of many movies by that name.  The plot is simple, we all know it.  People are invited to stay in a haunted house and will get paid 10,000 dollars if they last the night.  Vincent Price is in it and I happen to like him, so that's good.  Now, if you want you can watch the movie as is OR switch to the commentary with Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy, who I think also does the little song they play over the DVD menu.  They really do a good job, with all kinds of cultural references.  One of the characters, for example, is named Nora.  So of course they tossed in a Thin Man reference.  There is also a Scooby Doo reference that made me choke on my food.  Warning: don't eat food while watching this DVD.  The characters are kind of stupid when you think about it - would it not be better to just all stay in the same room for the next six hours or so?  Why this need to split up and make it easier to kill people?  Don't they watch horror movies?
I didn't notice anything that would make this unsuitable for kids, no adult language or adult jokes.  It is kind of a cross between the Film Crew and MST3K.  They play themselves and seem to keep it clean.  Mostly clean.  Somewhat clean.",1250553600,2,1232,4.11344537815126
3854209,4,B0026KJP76,"As a fan of old black and white ""B"" horror movies, I've always loved ""House on Haunted Hill.""  It's pretty lame by today's blood & gore standards, but I saw it as a kid and found it scarey.  I have quite a few DVD's of this movie, bought for a mere $1 during Halloween.  That said, I'm also a fan of the good-ole MST3K nitwits, and this was my first Rifftrax rental.  Don't expect the MST3K stuff like skits, shadows of the guys watching the movie, or even an introduction!  The movie starts and the guys immediately riff in the background.  You simply just HEAR, but never see them!  When the movie ends, they sign off.  I thought the riffing was good, especially for the two lame-brained leads who (of course) always place themselves in danger.  ""Lance"", the clumsy hero, is always just one step away from the next concussion.  ""Nora"", the terrorized woman, runs away from the horror by going into empty dark rooms.  They barely touch Vincent Price, but he's such a good actor and one of my favorites, so that's okay with me.  I'm happy to hear the guys, even if I can't see them.  That's probably why the Rifftrax DVD's are more affordable.",1248393600,23,1143,4.463768115942029
3854210,4,B0026KJP76,"This is a nice high-quality DVD of House on Haunted Hill. It was touch spartan; there's no subtitles of either the movie or the riffing, there's no MST3K-style video introduction (which would have been nice; would it have been hard to put a five minute pre-movie warmup, using whatever set came to hand), there's no shadows on the screen (which I've seen done with just subtitles, on the Ghostbusters DVD, IIRC), and there's not even a coming/available advertisement. There's just the movie, and two soundtracks, one with and one without riffing.

As for the meat of the material, House on Haunted Hill is a fairly classic old movie and moderately riffable. I'd place the riffs here about average for an MST3K and there was enough classic horror movie shtics and movie-specific jokes to make it worth my while.

But it is a good classic horror movie, and well worth your time watching it unMST3Ked before ruining all the surprises in the comedic mode. If you've got the DVD and haven't seen the movie, take the time to watch the original first.",1246406400,17,1044,4.762430939226519
3854212,4,B0026KJP76,"Pretty good follow-up to the MST3K series.  This time the Rifftrax crew, comprised of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett, attack House on Haunted Hill, a classic 50's horror film.  Very funny.  Highly recommended.",1442620800,,222,5.285714285714286

3854217,5,B0026KJP76,"The guys have done it again!  I remember watching this movie years ago with my dad and it's always been a favorite of ours.  He actually saw it when it came out in theaters and remembers the promotional poster for it.  So when I saw that there was a riff version of it I just had to have it.  It is hilarious.  The guys make you see a whole other side to the movie; the funny and irrational side.  This DVD comes with both the original and extra side-splitting versions of the movie.  If you haven't seen the original House on Haunted Hill, I would recommend watching that first, just to get a feel for it.  You may even be able to incorporate your own riffs while you watch it.  Maybe you can tell which is actually supposed to be haunted.",1408320000,,740,4.191489361702128

3854219,5,B0026KJP76,"I'd buy it again simply for Kevin's song at the beginning -- heck, I've bought it twice more to give as gifts to friends, who also thought it was just fabulous.  'House on Haunted Hill' on it's own is quite a classic, but this takes it to a whole new level.

If you're a fan of MST3K, I don't think you will be disappointed. If you don't appreciate MST3K, then this isn't for you.

I consider it to be the BEST RiffTrax to date.",1400198400,,428,4.071428571428571
3854220,2,B0026KJP76,"The Rifftrax boys take on a Vincent Price classical with moderately funny sucess. Has some classic riffs, but could have been so much better.",1399075200,,141,4.916666666666667
3854221,5,B0026KJP76,"To start, you have the immortally classic actor Vincent Price and his cast of characters that remind us all how cheesy the old horror films really were. Then comes the Rifftrax crew-totally knocked this out of the park! I saw this one in a movie theatre and the entire audience was laughing hysterically the whole time--buy this one and i promise you will not be disappointed!!!",1395273600,,378,4.742424242424242
3854222,4,B0026KJP76,"Yes, another B-winner favorite with pretty decent
execution, also with cheesy goodies.  A black and

3854223,4,B0026KJP76,"The original 1958 version of ""House on Haunted Hill"" may not exactly cry out for the RiffTrax treatment, but, I have to say, after watching Nelson, Murphy and Corbett do their thing, it probably had it coming. The William Castle-directed Vincent Price vehicle has lost a good deal of its original shock-value over the decades--let's face it, we're just not as easily scared as we used to be--but it does have its potentially funny moments, mainly because it tends to take itself just a wee bit too seriously. None of the actors are outstamdingly bad; they're just stuck with a stilted and rather cheesy script, and are doing what they can to make the best of a thankless gig. Vincent Price is watchable in whatever he's in, and while I wouldn't go so far as to say that he brings ""dignity"" to his role, he nonetheless plays it with such oily charm and schmaltzy menace that we can almost imagine him winking at us, letting us know he really does get how silly this stuff is. (Heck! Given Price's legendary sense of humor, you can almost imagine his ghost joining in on the riffing.) Elisha Cook, Richard Long, and Carol Ohmart aren't too terrible either, but, like the characters they portray, are simply trapped for the duration.

""House on Haunted Hill"" has been a perennial Halloween favorite of mine, so I was delighted to find out about this RiffTrax send-up. I've been a huge MST3K fan since its early Comedy Central days; so much of a fan, in fact, that I've actually caught myself riffing on Shakespeare. (Help! Is there a twelve-step program for this???)  This 2009 riff was done in a studio, and isn't quite as sharp or manically off-the-wall as the 2010 live version, filmed before a theater full of roaring fans. It seems as if the guys had time to tweak the jokes a bit in the interim between the two versions. The stuido session certainly has its moments, but no real belly laughs or coffee-up-the-nose situations.

I ended up getting both DVDs. This, the original 2009 studio production, has no special features or extras, but it does have a complete, un-cut and un-riffed black-and-white copy of ""House on Haunted Hill"", which looks like a fairly decent print.  The live 2010 production features a colorized version of the film. That disc has a few bare-bones extras, additional material including two typically weird short films, and the added spontaneity of a live performance; it does not, however, include a separate, un-riffed version of the movie. If I was forced to choose only one DVD, I'd probably go with the live version. But if you want a decent print of the original movie, and can afford both discs, by all means, go for it.",1382918400,,2654,4.701075268817204
3854224,5,B0026KJP76,"I have loved these guys since they used to be on MST3K, and their humor and wit are just as hilarious as ever!  I love the fact that they are doing some more mainstream horror flicks-- that makes the sarcasm and snappy patter even more entertaining than some of the more shlocky films they used to critique!",1362441600,,307,4.385964912280702
3854225,5,B0026KJP76,"Vincent Price stars in this long winded film and my God it takes an Ice Age for the movie to get started. Thankfully Mike Nelson, Bill Corbet and Kevin Murphy formerly of Mystery Science Theater 3000 poke fun and tear this flick a new butt as it richly deserved.  So many John Goodman references you'll have tears of laughter.  Highly recommend this for the chuckles.",1343347200,,367,4.630769230769231
3854226,5,B0026KJP76,"As usual RiffTrax does not disappoint. This is hysterical. I love the original and the new ""House on Haunted Hill"" and this just adds a new funny twist to the movie. Highly recommend for any fan of RiffTrax!",1337040000,,207,4.473684210526316
3854227,5,B0026KJP76,"Of all the current stand-alone rifftrax discs you can buy here at amazon right now, this is one of the two best, I think. I feel fond of the movie itself, which is always my preference (rather than the truly horrible films like Maniac which bore me by themselves).  The riffing is solid, topped off by a very funny song-over-credits, probably their second-best next to Sparkly Vampires.",1334016000,,386,4.7611940298507465
3854228,4,B0026KJP76,"Firstly, The House on Haunted Hill is actually a pretty good movie and generally delivers some solid thrills.  To have Mike Nelson and Co. providing laughs is almost an embarrassment of riches.  You get a terrific little Vincent Price movie about a handful of invited guests who must survive a night in a huge haunted house to collect some serious money AND you get some of the funniest riffing that the crew at RiffTrax can provide.  It's like watching the Saturday Night Creature Feature with three of your best invisible friends.  For a night's entertainment, you can't do better than the price of this disc.",1331251200,2,611,4.79047619047619
3854229,5,B0026KJP76,Great riffing on this old movie.  A bonus: the movie without the riffing comments is on the other side of the DVD.,1323734400,,114,4.181818181818182
3854230,5,B0026KJP76,"Right up there with my other favorite of the Rifftrax (Plan 9 from Outer Space). This one has Vincent Price, who actually has an interesting role and some pretty fair acting in this film, at least I thought it was. The most funny moments are with one of the guests, Lance the stud airplane pilot, who is always after the women, of course. The screaming woman is utterly hilarious and riffs outstanding. Perfect movie for Rifftrax. Keep em coming.",1267315200,4,446,4.658227848101266
3854231,5,B0026KJP76,"My siblings and I grew up watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes on VHS tapes and on cable/satellite TV. We were disillusioned and upset when the Sci-Fi/Syfy Channel canceled it in 1999. Thank goodness for these Rifftrax DVD's. It feels like we're reunited with old friends. One can watch House on Haunted Hill(1959) with or without the audio commentary. Other than that, there are no other extra features. MST3K's Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett poke fun of the decent, albeit gimmicky horror film House on Haunted Hill(1959) starring Vincent Price. Price plays an eccentric rich guy who offers people a million dollars to spend the night in a haunted house. This film was remade in 1999, I think.

Screaming woman: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Kevin Murphy: Someone found John Goodman on the toilet!

(A woman shoots Vincent Price with a gun)
Bill Corbett: That was for Thriller! Do you know how many people in this country were traumatized by it?

(Commenting on actress Carol Ohmart)
Mike Nelson: She's nude and she looks like Hayden Panettiere!

I hope Legend Films keeps pumping out low priced Rifftrax DVD's. Mystery Science Theater 3000 lives on...more or less.",1257465600,3,1185,5.124352331606218

8352893,5,B0026KJP76,"I've seen House on Haunted Hill before and wasn't sure if I should get a Rifftrax version.  Then I saw it.  As always their comedy was spot on and very entertaining, but there was more.  I hadn't realized how useless the test pilot character was throughout the movie until they pointed it out. He spends most of the movie injured or lost and really contributes nothing to the film except looking competent (even if he isn't). There are also two shorts, including the Grocery Witch who demands people spend their money wisely when buying food.  After all, smart choices at the store can save pennies!  The short on paper products appeared in a Rifftrax shorts collection, but they added jokes in this version that made it entertaining to see a small sick boy be carried off by a paper bag.  Yes, that sentence made no sense, but neither did the short.",1501372800,,850,4.596026490066225

8352898,5,B0026KJP76,"The Rifftrax gang bravely takes-on a perennial favorite, ""House On Haunted Hill"". This is absolutely a hilarious riffed dvd! I could point-out so many extremely funny situations in the movie with the accompanying riffs, but that would be spoiling things for those who have not yet had the pleasure to enjoy this selection from Rifftrax. I love the original movie, and when I found that Rifftrax was offering it on dvd I just had to give it a try. I was a bit concerned that my love for this movie would make the riffing seem not up-to-par. I was delightfully surprised when I found that the riffing was not only quite up-to-par, but went way up over-par(?). I laugh just thinking about many of the scenes and comments. I watch this one over and over. Well, I do that with all my Rifftrax dvds and downloads from their website. As with their other dvds, the gang at Rifftrax has a selectable menu which allows the viewer to watch the movie in its original format (no riffing) or with the riffing. Hey, sometimes you feel like a nut... sometimes you don't. Anyway, this Rifftax edition of ""House On Haunted Hill"" is a gold mine of laughs. While the menu is on the screen, the Rifftrax gang came-up with a nice little ditty about ""House On Haunted Hill"". The song is funny enough before one watches the riffed movie, but after seeing the riffed version the song is even funnier, as one now understands what the references are to. And as with Rifftrax's ""Night Of The Living Dead"", I bought an extra copy of this dvd to give to my brother, with the threat that he'd better watch it. I'm his big brother, so he is supposed to listen... I hope. This was money well spent. Riffing of the highest caliber from the legendary Rifftrax gang! Buy it. You will be a happier person.  ~terry",1471910400,,1776,4.498452012383901
