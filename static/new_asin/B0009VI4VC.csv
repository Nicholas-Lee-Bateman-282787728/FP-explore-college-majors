2325130,5,B0009VI4VC,"While Geri never stops talking through the yoga workout, it can be easily overlooked.  There is great instruction for beginners who can be intimidated by the poses.  The caveats given about shoulder and head stand being done with a teacher in the beginning of learning are not usually given in yoga workout videos.  I have been practicing yoga for over 18 years and I have seldom heard the warnings given that were said on this dvd.  I agree the set ups are slow but I do not believe that this workout is geared toward the experienced practitioner.  But I still enjoyed it.",1125360000,8,573,4.578431372549019
2325131,1,B0009VI4VC,"I really wanted to like this dvd.  But I have to say that I couldn't even make it through the first fifteen minutes By then I wanted to put a muzzle on both Geri AND the instructor.  I kept telling myself to give it a chance but it just moves soooooo slowly while they talk and go over every detail of the next move.  The other reviewer was right about being left twiddling your thumbs.  I was so bored with this workout that I didn't even finish it and that is not like me.  Usually once I start, I go ahead and do the whole thing whether I like it or not.  I just couldn't take it anymore with this one.  I had to stop.  I only got through about twenty minutes of it.  I did put it back in later to watch Geri's commentary at the end and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing at all ""enlightening"" in that section.  Just more rambling....I'm really disappointed...like I said, I really wanted to like it...I know I won't ever do this workout again.",1124928000,5,960,4.140540540540541
2325132,1,B0009VI4VC,"geri halliwell- of spice girl ""fame""-literally never stops talking in this dvd!  the program starts ok, despite ginger/geri constant yapping, very slow warm up. the poses section is supposed to be more active, but they spend so much time on the the modifier setting up the pose that the more experienced practioner is left twiddling their thumbs.  the cool down is pleasant but unremarkable.",1124582400,6,391,5.09375
8067500,5,B0009VI4VC,I love this DVD. You feel amazing afterward. Geri Halli and Katy Appleton did a great job and they balance each other out well.,1513814400,,127,4.333333333333333
8067501,5,B0009VI4VC,This is fun for people who are starting out doing yoga and fans of Geri Halliwell also known as Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls! Geri does chime in and say some strange things but its what you would expect from her. Katy does a great job instructing you through your yoga routines. I would also recommend Geri Body Yoga with Katy Appleton too.,1397174400,,343,4.375
8067502,4,B0009VI4VC,"I've had this DVD... probably since last spring or earlier. I'm pretty sure I bought it with a gift card that I got for Christmas in 2010. I just never got around to actually using it. I wish I had. I love it! It's Geri Yoga, with Geri Halliwell (apparently a former Spice Girl - not that I have a clue about stuff like that) and her yoga instructor. If you like total silence during your yoga, it's not for you, but if you don't mind some fun chit-chat and comments, I'd recommend it.

I've previously used Denise Austin's yoga DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Yoga-Plus/dp/B00005R86M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Yoga Plus</a>&nbsp;and I like it, but I was getting bored with it. This DVD has a lot of new poses that I've never even seen (and I've checked out other yoga DVDs from the library) and they're really big on stressing to start gently and not strain yourself.

It's fun, just challenging enough (I still consider myself a beginner), and my back feels better already. I'm not sure of the point of all the talking at the end of the DVD, but you can just skip that part; it has nothing to do with the workout.",1335571200,2,1176,4.875
8067503,4,B0009VI4VC,"I had used Geribody Yoga for awhile before finding out about this one, and they are different enough that I alternate using them.

The cons: This DVD, Geri Yoga, is less structured and polished than Geribody Yoga - it feels less organized.  If you just let it play (which I do), you do sun salutations before Katy goes into preparation for cobra, so when she goes into that explanation, it's kind of awkward since you've already done it.  Also, there are a few times when I feel like you spend more time on one side than the other, which is easy enough to adjust once you're used to the DVD.  And Katy doesn't really explain how to do a headstand, which isn't something I would have expected to learn from a DVD anyway, but it seems like a waste of time for us to just watch Geri doing a headstand and never receive instruction on how to do it.  Geri talks quite a bit throughout the session, but for the most part I don't particularly mind that.  I don't like the bit at the end, after the savasana, where it's just her talking and talking - it feels aimless and like its intention was to take up time.

The pros: I really, really like doing a lot of the poses.  Some are different from the ones in Geribody Yoga - crow, dolphin, and cradling lotus come to mind - and I love the way Katy instructs savasana at the end.  Katy does a pretty good job of making suggestions for different levels.  Physically, I feel great at the end of the DVD, which is really what's important to me anyway.  Also, despite Geri's chatter, she really is likable.

Overall I'd rate it about 70% - I'm glad I have it and it makes me feel great, but there are definitely a few things I'd change about it if I could.",1286496000,,1692,4.253125
8067504,5,B0009VI4VC,"I have done Yoga before, but not steadily, and have several other DVD's on this subject.  This one is my favorite.  Itis a  very relaxing atmosphere, (yes, Geri always has something to add), but who doesn't know someone like that?  It's always very positive and what people are thinking anyway, but just don't have that sweet blunt way that she does.  I guess if you're looking for a very serious workout, that's different, but I felt that I was in a room working out with a bunch of friends.  Kasy Appleton always seems so concerned that noone does more than they should for their body, and keeps mentioning to slow down and follow your body's lead.  When I first picked this DVD up, I didn't know that Geri was a Spice Girl', or I wouldn't have taken it seriously, but I'm glad that I did.  She's a riot, and has one of those personalities that can't just 'zip it', (like me), that's what makes it so fun, to break up the monotony, and her perfect accent is so funny.  She's gorgeous, but doesn't act like it at all, (which makes me like her even more)!  I have John Lee, and  love his very serious  workouts, but this is so refreshing, I live in the country and feel like when I put the DVD in the recorder, it's time to have fun with real friends!  Thanks Geri and Katy, and I'm so glad that I bought your two DVD set.  I hope you come out with more, you make it all so fun!",1273622400,,1378,4.209923664122138
8067505,5,B0009VI4VC,"This is a great DVD for those who are just too busy for all the 20 minute intro tree-hugging hippy yoga DVDs out there. It explains all the history and basics of breathing behind yoga without trying to make you into a guru swami. Geri displays the more ""difficult"" versions of each posture while Tina displays the beginner, I can't even touch my toes version (which Geri freely admits to being way-back-when) and Katy Appleton is out the front as the very hip expert explaining all the important things like breathing, where to focus the stretch and gives this great DVD its credibility. A 10 minute warm up, a 20 minute warm up and then 20 minute ""Sun salutation"" make it the perfect DVD to have in the player for first thing in the morning, when you can assess how much time you've got to devote and choose accordingly. It is always the Yoga Dvd I return to amongst the myriad of other I own, when I need it.",1265846400,,910,4.390532544378698
8067506,4,B0009VI4VC,"Katy Appleton as the instructor explains the approach to the postures. So it is a learning class, not just a workout routine. I like that they encourage the viewer to do the best they can and not try to be too perfect. They do show you what you are trying to achieve but on a given day one may not be able to get there. I like the two levels of exercise. At times I began with the easier approach but could move into the more demanding one as the class went in that direction. Both levels are demonstrated and explained.
 I bought this one because of Geri.  She looks good and is very scantily attired. There are two other people demonstrating different levels. I found this to be a good informative class that does not take itself too seriously.  They talk to each other during some of the poses and Geri tries to crack a joke once in awhile. All with the British accent.

This video is rather long. More than 90 minutes, but I like that it doesn't rush.  I found that I like the space to rest in between poses while Ms Appleton explains the next pose.  Some instructors jump into the next pose right away.  I liked the relaxation at the end. It's about 5 minutes.
Their approach takes great care to remind me not to go beyond my limitations.  Those limitations might vary somewhat from day to day. It does show you the more challenging positions too, if you can go there. I usually can't.

In the end I feel like I've done a worthwhile workout. I felt good when I finished the class.",1248652800,,1485,4.293906810035843
8067507,4,B0009VI4VC,"I really like this DVD. I Have tried yoga before and always gotten very bored with it. But this caught my attention because of Geri. So I gave it a try. I love the DVD. Yes she does talk but she is not only selling yoga she is selling herself. Thats why I bought the dvd. I would have been annoyed if she just sat there and said 2 words. Plus she is super funny and doesn't take the situation or herself too seriously. Most people who do yoga take things too seriously for me at least, maybe thats why I found this so refreshing and fun to do.",1201392000,,543,3.9908256880733943
8067508,1,B0009VI4VC,I WAS REALLY EXCITED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO- IT WAS HORRIBLE - IT DOESN'T FLOW EASILY - THE GUIDE KEEPS GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN GERI AND A BEGINNER AND SHE'LL FOCUS MORE ON THE BEGINNER AND BABY STEP YOU THROUGH THE SIMPLEST OF POSES AND THEN PAN THE CAMERA OVER TO GERI WHO'S INSTANTLY IN A MORE COMPLICATED POSE - BUT THEN THEY DON'T EXPLAIN HOW GERI GOT THERE...THIS VIDEO DOES NOT GIVE YOU A GOOD WORKOUT....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,1177027200,3,445,4.439024390243903
8067509,5,B0009VI4VC,"While I'm sure that anyone with a lot of yoga experience would be bored nearly senseless, this DVD was perfect for me. I felt like I was part of a very small class, as Katy moved back and forth between Geri doing the advanced work and another woman doing easier poses. I felt so smooth and relaxed after, and my shoulders and back didn't crack at all for the rest of the day.

Geri DOES talk far too much, and seems rather obsessed with which poses help your digestive system, but it didn't stress me out. This DVD is more instructional than a workout, but I certainly felt worked out after.

Overall, a good start for a beginner but probably not for more advanced students.",1151712000,,674,4.384
