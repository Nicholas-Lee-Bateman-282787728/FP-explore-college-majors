3978523,5,B002SAMMQA,This has to be the best way to watch Top Gear! Has the play all feature which is a must for TV series on DVD. The shows are so smooth compared to how they are on TV.,1266192000,3,165,3.4864864864864864
3978524,4,B002SAMMQA,"Yes, the Top Gear nuts are back- racing across Japan in a car v. bullet train challenge, reviving fox hunting using a fox-colored Daihatsu sports vehicle, testing which supercar is the most efficient in race conditions (the winner doing less than 5 MPG), and ruining British-German diplomatic efforts with a contest against a German auto show. If you like either cars or British humor, you will love this show- and this set.

Season 11 is of special interest for aficionados of Japanese culture, as not one but three films take place there: the aforementioned ""epic race"" of sports car v. Japanese public transport, the track test of the Nissan GT-R from said race, and James May using a Japanese luxury car to deliver sumo wrestlers to a tournament. For these sequences alone, in my opinion, the set is worth the money to anime fans.

THAT SAID... the same problems that existed with the Season 10 set remain. The episodes are NOT completely uncut- Top Gear Stuntman's sequences have all been left out, and other cuts may exist that I haven't found in one viewing. That said, the cuts are less egregious than the Season 10 episodes- all news segments are present and (apparently) intact, as are all Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car. Viewers of BBC America will see quite a lot they didn't before.

Skip points in the DVD set are limited to the start point of each film- none within the film segments themselves. Since some of these segments are half an hour long, that makes queueing up particular bits for friends a pain in the fundament.

Extras? Well, it has subtitles... with some serious transcription flaws. (Note: ""Torque"" and ""talk"" are not the same word, really they're not.) No ""deleted scenes,"" no behind-the-scenes, no commentary. It's a basic two-disc set of six episodes, with the frills limited to auto-playing trailers.

The show is excellent, and it's good to have the series sets coming to the USA... but I really wish the DVD release was as good as the show being released.",1263772800,26,1993,4.781976744186046
3978525,5,B002SAMMQA,"Wish it didn't take so long for these to come out on video in the US!  This show is really fun, even for those of us who aren't real car enthusiasts.  The hosts and the segments/challenges are top notch.",1262822400,2,203,4.17948717948718

3978715,5,B002SAMMQA,There is little that is more entertaining than the Top Gear series. There are 16-17 seasons that can be watched on Netflix. I'm surprised that most people in the US don't know about it. I don't even like cars but find them worth watching; they are sort of a modern 3 stooges.,1355788800,,275,4.3076923076923075

I highly recommend the entire 15 seasons to anyone who has the least interest in cars.

3978773,3,B002SAMMQA,"Americans who buy the entire ""season"" of Top Gear need to be warned that, in typical BBC series fashion, their ""season"" has only a fourth of the episodes that we're used to.  Why this is troubling isn't the content or the show itself, which is bloody brilliant.  Even someone like me, who isn't a gear-head and can't tell an Italian sports car from a Ford Focus, can love this show and the three guys with their boyish antics.  I can't get enough of it.  But with a season of only 6 episodes and absolutely no other extras at all, I can't justify the price (although this season just had its price lowered by Amazon--some of the other seasons are still priced at $30, or $5 per episode.  That's why I only gave it 3 stars--the show deserves 5 stars, but the price should have gotten zero.",1276128000,12,788,4.36986301369863
