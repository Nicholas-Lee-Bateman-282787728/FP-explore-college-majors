probably you will feel like something is missing.
But there's nothing to worry about.

Not as powerfull as other shows but still as enjoyable.
It doesn't have subtitles so, unless you know japanese
you'll probably miss a joke or two.
Don't worry, not the greatest jokes ever :P

On the bright side, It actually is a very nice show, the ""new"" songs,
Fumiya at his best, and great performances by Rip Slyme, Coma-Chi and Mongol800.
DVD 2 is quite nice. It has rehearsals, a street walk around Hiroshima
and a Promo Video for SPLASH (also an Axe commercial).

All in all, a good buy if you want to complete a Rip Slyme collection
or if you're a new Rip Slyme fan.",1240272000,3,696,4.338461538461538
