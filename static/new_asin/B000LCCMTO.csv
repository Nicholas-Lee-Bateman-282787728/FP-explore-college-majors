Mack Dogg nailed it with this gem, avoid disappointment and future regret, and purchase today.",1369526400,,258,4.953488372093023
8161422,5,B000LCCMTO,"Amazing.  I usually like a little more back country riding in my videos but this is just a great video.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely one of the best videos of all time.  Very different music selection from most other similar videos.  I now have a few of them on my ipod and listen to them regularly now.",1337731200,,319,4.180327868852459
8161423,5,B000LCCMTO,"Ive seen quite a few surf and snowboarding movies. When I was starting to snowboard, I saw this, and I was blown away. Beside the fantastic filming,scenery, stunts, tricks, cast and amazing (really really cool) music it has, it has this great feeling growing under it while you are watching it,  a fun feeling, showing you what snowboarding is about and how should you take it. It is about good times.
I always rememberd this film when I am on the board, and how much fun one should always have.
I wish Mack Dawg could make a blu ray about this one. Its just right.",1293062400,,565,4.380952380952381
