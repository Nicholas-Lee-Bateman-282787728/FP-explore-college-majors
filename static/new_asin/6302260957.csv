446540,3,6302260957,"A lot of people don't think this was a good PPV.  It was not the greatest Survivor Series ppv but I thought it was a pretty good PPV.  1992 was a very interesting time in the WWF being that this was the second PPV that did not have a Hogan oriented main event.  It was also the first Survivor Series where the whole card was not full of Survivor Series style tag matches.  My favorite match of this PPV was ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Henning's comeback match where he teamed with the ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage to face Ric Flair and Razor Ramon.  Also included is the Undertaker vs. Kamala in the first televised Casket/Coffin Match, Big Bossman vs. Nailz in a Nightstick Match, World Champ Bret Hart defends against I-C Champ Shawn Michaels, and more.",1127520000,,742,4.466666666666667

November 24, 1992

Richfield Coliseum

Richfield, Ohio

High Energy V. Headshrinkers

Ok opener. This match would have been better if KoKo wasn't getting his ass kicked most of the match. The Headshrinkers win. **1/2

Nightstick Match:

Big Bossman V. Nailz

This is the first and (thankfully) only Nightstick match. No real big spots. Just boring. Bossman wins. *1/4

Tatanka V. Rick ""The Model"" Martel

This match was actually not bad. Doink makes his Pay-Per-View debut by being Doink at ringside. Tatanka wins. ***

""Macho Man"" Randy Savage & Mr. Perfect V. Ric Flair & Razor Ramon

Here it goes. Savages partner was suppose to be the Ultimate Warrior but the Warrior quit just two weeks before the show which left Vince in a pickle. Savage then asks Perfect to be his partner and Perfect shockingly accepts. The Brain gets pissed and Perfect pours water on him to make the Perfect face turn. Ok...on with the match.

This is the Main Event. I don't care if it's the fourth match of the night. Not every main event is the last match on the card. Very good match. I don't see why they had to have a cheap DQ ending with Savage & Perfect winning. Razor was too green to protect anyways. Oh well. ***1/2

Virgil V. Yokozuna

um...not a good match at all. Yoko wins. 3/4*

Classic Survivor Series Tag team Elimination Match:

Money Inc. & Beverly Brothers V. Nasty Boys & Natural Disasters

Umm...ok...the Tag Team Champs lose the match? The Nasty Boys were just hanging on the apron the whole match and they roll up IRS to win? That's just not fair to Money Inc. *1/2

Coffin Match:

Undertaker V. Kamala

This was the first ever Coffin Match. Ok..they were pin falls in the first one. Taker of cousre wins in a horrible match to end a horrible feud with Kamala. 1/2*

A Little History: Ric Flair was the Champ. However, he got injuried. Instead of having a Champion who couldn't defend the title. Flair had to drop the title. The question was to who? A surprise Savgae title run wouldn't have the drama. Warrior lefted the company. Undertaker was in a feud with Kamala, which was no means a Championship feud. The person of choice was Bret Hart. Bret was having classic matches since he became a singles wrestler and it was his time. But there's more.

The Bulldog was the Intercontinental Champion. WCW offerend the Bulldog more money and the Bulldog was going to leave the company. So at the last episode of Saturday Night Main Event, Shawn Michaels won the title. Bret & Shawn in a months time now hold the only two single titles in the company and they will be facing each other at Survivor Series!

WWF Championship:

Bret Hart (Champion) V. Shawn Michales

Ok...It's Bret Hart defending the WWF Championship against Shawn Michales at Survivor Series with Vince McMahon at ringside and Earl Hebnar the referee. Do you know the ending? Oh wait...sorry....wrong Survivor Series. It's actually very scary watching this match now. However, the match was awesome. Both men were at the time of they game. Hart retains the Title. ****1/2 I was watching this match and I noticed that both men looked like they really hated each other back then. Again, it was very weird watching this match.

Overall, not a every good show but very watchable to see Bret V. Shawn in an errie setting.",1126656000,,3304,4.671280276816609
446542,3,6302260957,"The 6th annual Survivor Series took place in Cleveland, Ohio, where it underwent a significant change to its traditional format of four-on-four or five-on-five elimination matches.  Instead, it is merely a hodgepodge of novelty matches with a WWF championship defense as the main event.

Highlights:

1. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage & ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig vs. Ric Flair & Razor Ramon: Ex-WWF champion Savage takes most of the punishment in this match, which allows Hennig to make the big save at the end.  Unfortunately, the DQ finish in favor of the ""Perfect Team"" proves a disappointment for those fans who wanted a definite winner.  The amusing pre-match & post-match interviews help make up the difference.
4 stars ****

2. I-C Champion Shawn Michaels vs. WWF Champion Bret Hart: In a half-hour showcase, these two put on a superb match where Hart manages to finally triumph over his eventual successor as the WWF's main player.
5 stars *****

3. Undertaker vs. Kamala in a casket match: Recommended for Undertaker fans, but that's about it.
2 1/2 **

The lowlights:

1. Yokozuna vs. Virgil: You can guess how this one ends.
2 **

2. Nailz vs. Big Bossman in a nightstick match: For hard-core Bossman fans only .....
2 **

3. Beverly Brothers & Money Inc. vs. Natural Disasters & Nasty Boys (the only elimination match): The Road Warriors and any other quality teams are sorely missed.
1 1/2 *

4. The appearance of Doink the clown.
0 stars

The luster of previous Survivor Series has considerably worn off by the time this rendition took place.  If you enjoyed the WWF of the early 1990's, then I recommend it.  If not, try a Survivor Series from 1987 through 1989.  They're a vast improvement.",1096588800,,1700,4.790378006872852
446543,1,6302260957,"do not buy this or even watch this. bret hart and shawn michaels are my two favorite wrestlers of all time, but that match even sucked. by the way people say that this is the first time bret and shawn wrestled WRONG. When bret had his second IC title reignin the summer of 92 they were fueding like crazy. second shawn vs. razor at wrestlemania was not the first ever ladder match. bret vs shawn michaels at a house show in may of 1992 was the first ladder match!! not even the wwe can get thier story straight!!!
i would have given this ppv a 0 if i could have , it does not even deserve 1 star",1090022400,,595,4.0508474576271185
446544,3,6302260957,"The sixth annual ""Survivor Series"" was the first to not feature a line-up of elimination matches. The night was headlined by a tag team main event as Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage and Mr. Perfect (a last minute alternate for the Ultimate Warrior) took on ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair and Razor Ramon. We also saw the beginning of one of the WWF's most historic feuds as the newly-crowned WWF Champion Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart battled Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels in their first pay-per-view match.
We also got to see two specialty matches- The Undertaker versus Kamala in a casket match and Big Bossman versus Nailz in a Nightstick Match. The late Yokozuna made his WWF debut against Virgil. The night also saw the PPV debut of The Headshrinkers, Tatanka vs. Rick Martel in a grudge match, and a special appearance by Doink The Clown.
The 1992 ""Survivor Series"" was not one of the better events but still a decent night of action. The traditional format was sorely missed.",1063238400,4,971,4.820359281437126

7823409,3,6302260957,The only 2 two worth seeing are the Bret Hart-HBK-World title match & the tag team match bewteen the team of Razor Ramon & Ric Flair against the team of Randy Savage & Mr. Perfect. The rest stink like the movie:Mr. Nanny. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.,1282435200,,252,3.9607843137254903
7823410,2,6302260957,"High Energy vs. Headshrinkers - For those who don't remember, High Energy was the team of Owen Hart & WWE Hall Of Famer Koko B. Ware (still can't believe I just said that).  While Energy were able to get in a few moves, including Koko stomping their bare feet, this was mostly a dominate performance from the Headshrinkers.

Nightstick Match: Big Boss Man vs. Nailz - This was a glorified ""nightstick on a pole"" match to finish the feud between these two that was based on a very brutal beating (for that time) by Nailz onto the Boss Man with his own nightstick.  This match started before the bell rang & was just a sloppy brawl for the most part.  The nightstick didn't come into play until the closing moments of this match but this was all about Boss Man getting his revenge which he did.

Tatanka vs. Rick Martel - This was actually a rematch from WrestleMania earlier in the year but more personal as Tatanka was out for revenge after Martel took his sacret eagle feather & made them a decoration for his hat.  This was actually a pretty nice match that went back & forth between each man before Doink made an appearence at ringside ""clowning around"" with the fans at ringside causing more focus from the cameramen & commentators on Doink's actions outside of the ring.  Tatanka eventually won the match but that was an afterthought as the focus here was Doink at ringside which ruined this match.

Randy Savage & Mr. Perfect vs. Ric Flair & Razor Ramon - The backstage story behind this match was that it was originally setup to be Ultimate Warrior as Savage's partnet but his quick departure from the WWE right before this PPV caused a last minute storyline with Mr. Perfect being tired of taking orders from Bobby Heenan & Ric Flair and agreeing to team with Savage to get his hands on Flair.  It should also be noted that this was Perfect's return to the ring since SummerSlam '91 while this was also the PPV debut of Razor Ramon as both men started the match with both Perfect & Savage showing up Flair & Razor early on.  The story behind this match was the question of if Savage could trust Perfect and there was a moment where Perfect teased leaving Savage alone before coming back to aid him.  It went back & forth before the match started to get out of control with Flair & Razor using chairs.  Perfect look like he didn't lose a step in his first match in over a year while everyone else held it together for this good match that was only hurt by the ending.

Virgil vs. Yokozuna - This was Yokozuna's PPV debut in a squash only to showcase as a dominate force leading into the Royal Rumble & the eventual WWE Championship match at WrestleMania.

Elimination Match: Natural Disasters & Nasty Boys vs. Money Inc. & Beverly Brothers - This was the only ""traditional"" Survivor Series elimination match however the rules were changed here as whenever a wrestle loses a fall, him & his partner are both eliminated.  It was only the year before that the Beverly Brothers were teaming with the Nasty Boys now to find themselves on opposite teams along with the fact that it was both the Nasty Boys & Natural Disasters who Jimmy Hart turned his back on in favor of Money Inc.  This was about as good as you expected it to be with all the talents involved but it seriously was a stepdown from the quality we usually get in these elimination matches.

Coffin (Casket) Match: Undertaker vs. Kamala - This was the first ever coffin match (later renamed Casket Match) with the rules being a little different than we know then now as you had to win a fall before putting your opponent in the coffin.  This match itself was pretty short & sweet (a little over 5 mins.) just to finish the feud between Taker & Kamala but only important as this was the first of many casket matches.
(Undertaker's Deadliest Matches)

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - This one of those matches that have been classified as a ""lost classic"" because it's a high quality match that have gone down as one of the best in both men's careers but always gets overshadowed by other encounters that are more famous (or infamous) for one reason or another. This was the first singles match between both men on PPV, Shawn Michaels' first PPV main event, and for those Survivor Series historians...this was the fourth time they were in a match together, first of 3 times Bret & Shawn would face each other at this event & this match was exactly 5 years (give or take a few days) before the ""screwjob"". Shawn Michaels walked into this match as the Intercontinental Champion after defeating British Bulldog for the belt around a week earlier so the added story to this match was that Shawn had the advantage since he recently beat the man who Bret Hart at the previous PPV. This is a match that I can't describe as words wouldn't do it justice as they went around 30 mins. here in a classic performance that showcased the new era that WWE was going in where it was built on athleticism & wrestling. Again, a lost classic that made both men walk out with more credibility than they walked in with.
(Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's)

In the end, this PPV proved that change isn't always a good thing as they abandoned the traditional formula of Survivor Series heavily revolving around the elimination matches only to give us a PPV with very short & low quality matches with the only performances that were noteworthy being the two main events.  It's not worth buying the tape just to see those two matches (with one already on DVD) so I would suggest purchasing the second volume of the Survivor Series anthology with this event on it if you really must see it.",1277337600,,5642,4.517173699705594
7823411,2,6302260957,"Headshrinkers VS High Energy: I'll never understand why Koko B Ware is in the WWE Hall of Fame but I digress. A decent opener but nothing great.

Nailz VS Big Bossman in a Nightstick on a Pole match: Nailz cuts a scary promo before the match and that is not exaggerating. The promo was way ahead of it's time but i'll say that reason for my overall thoughts. The match was brutal when the nightstick came into play and Bossman wins in the end.

A recap of Savage picking Mr Perfect after Warrior left the company. Heenan slaps Perfect and thus turns Perfect a fan favorite as he dumps water on Heenan. Pretty good segement I thought.

Tatanka VS Rick Martel: Doink The Clown is shown thru out the match and it ruined a good match. Tatanka wins in the end but the camera focused to much on the antics of Doink.

Ric Flair and Razor Ramon VS Randy Savage and Mr Perfect: The crowd goes nuts for Savage as he enters and Heenan goes off on Perfect as he makes his way towards the ring. Mr Perfect is also wearing one of his worst outfits ever. The match was good but the ending was stupid.

The interview with Ramon and Flair after the match was good though.

Yokozuna debuts and destorys Virgil. Mr Fuji still had a full head of hair too!

Beverly Brothers and Money Inc VS Natural Diseasters and Nasty Boys: I skipped over this match because it was just plain dull.

Kamala VS Undertaker: As I stated in other reviews, Undertaker sure had some crappy opponents in his early days. This is like a Hogan match as Kamala beats on Taker for a few minutes then boom! Taker comes back and wins it.

Bret Hart VS Shawn Michaels: This was an excellent encounter in this legendary feud.

Overall, the main event is worth checking out and I'd dare say the only good match besides that was Bossman-Nailz. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch this.",1257984000,,1848,4.37719298245614
