8503458,1,B000M02YZC,"This DVD is not what it is advertised to be.  It contains seven short films, with original footage from WWI.  However, the formatting is off and several of the movies are off the screen (you cannot read the words in the silent films).  In addition the segment on Henry Ford cuts off in the middle and does not show any WWI footage as promised.  I am a high school teacher and was planning on showing the films to my World History classes, but the DVD I received is useless.",1179964800,4,473,4.280898876404494
