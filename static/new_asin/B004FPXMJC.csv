4370849,3,B004FPXMJC,"The Hello Kitty cartoons are among my daughters' favorites! And why the ""Cat Wars"" parody isn't considered one of the great Star Wars Parodies Of All Time is something I will never understand.

But I made a mistake in buying this three-pack. Two of the disks in the triple pack are actually a two-sided DVD. For an adult Hello Kitty collector, that would be fine; but if you have a three-year-old who is prone to scratching disks up, this doubles the chance of destroying the movie.

Spend the extra couple of dollars to buy individual DVDs.

Five stars for the content; 1 star for the disks.",1331251200,,592,4.566037735849057
4370850,1,B004FPXMJC,"If you are looking to buy this for a little girl like I was, don't waste your money on this.  The content could actually be upsetting for some children and these episodes involve vindictive characters.  I was only able to watch about 10 minutes of this with my daughter before we made the mutual decision to shut it off.  Also, the episodes are very antiquated although that shouldn't matter all that much.  My advice would be to stick with the Hello Kitty Stump Village series which is much more innocent and appropriate for small children.",1330300800,28,541,4.663157894736842
4370851,4,B004FPXMJC,G/Daughter enjoyed it,1442534400,,21,6.333333333333333
4370852,3,B004FPXMJC,"I would recommend ""Hello Kitty and Friends"" series and ""Hello Kitty's Paradise"", and anything newer. both were made during the 90's and their stories lives up to more moral standards for children, (yes, as young as 2, however it might be over-compelling to some.) all while having more character development, broader adventure with more sophisticated story dialogue that also suits older children.  Enjoyable even to me as an adult because you can actually take these stories seriously! it feels like you're watching an anime aimed at smaller children. THIS collection, as mentioned in the comments, was aired in 1987. Each episode is based on whimsical dialogue. There is too much name-calling, bickering, and mischief caused by the main characters. I sat through ALL of the episodes, and it felt more like I was watching something a kid ages 7-10 would laugh from under today's standards. I was little reluctant of my 1 year old watching this, we only bought it for 5-bucks at walmart and didn't do research before hand. I'd give it three stars to be fair, it is dated, a lot of viewing-standards have changed for children over the decades. I would only recommend to a collector for older additions to the sanio company. But I personally didn't care for it.",1439596800,2,1259,4.910798122065728
4370853,5,B004FPXMJC,"My kids love this movie! If you like the older hello kitty, this movie is for you! Each disc has multiple episodes on it.",1437609600,,121,4.083333333333333
4370854,1,B004FPXMJC,"Horrible DVD!!! I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this DVD,
I assumed from the titles it was geared towards 2 year olds...NOT EVEN CLOSE.
Very vintage cartoon fashion and not made for little children.
I came across Growing Up with Hello Kitty 1 & 2 which was
exactly what I was wanting, not this Horrible DVD.",1431820800,,326,4.45

4370856,5,B004FPXMJC,"Great deal for 3, but it is not very fun and colorful like other Hello Kitty movies.  Daughter watches it off and on.",1425168000,,117,4.086956521739131
4370857,5,B004FPXMJC,"I bought these for myself just for a trip down memory lane.  These cartoons are the same ones that used to air on Toon Disney back in the late 90's.  While I really find these clever and cute, I see a lot of parents complain about these cartoons frightening their kids.

So I thought I'd give you guys a heads up:  These are NOT aimed at the same audience as ""Growing Up with Hello Kitty""  (the 2-3 age group where kids are still learning how to go to the bathroom and saying please and thank you).  Instead, this series might be better for kids who can tell the difference between reality and fantasy and have outgrown imitating everything they see on tv.  Maybe 5 years - 7 years but everyone's different.

As for the villains and scariness, it's nothing more than you would see in your average Disney film.  But if your children are easily spooked by characters like The Wicked Queen from  Snow White or No Heart from the 80's Care Bears series, you might want to wait before you buy this DVD.

So all in all, don't automatically ban this fun cartoon from your home, just wait until your little kitty fans are mature enough to handle it.",1425168000,2,1140,4.380952380952381
4370858,5,B004FPXMJC,"I bought these for a friends little girl and myself.  I agree with several people that kids under the age 6 or 7 it might not be appropriate but I think they are ideal for adults and children of 7 or 8 years old or older.  I personally enjoyed them and thought they were fun retelling of some great fairy tale stories...in the case Furry Tales!  All the cartoons start with ""Once Upon A Meow""",1423785600,,392,4.2

4370871,1,B004FPXMJC,"These movies are not for 2-5 year olds.  They have a very Tom and Jerry feel - very dated.  The language used is definitely not appropriate for 2-5 year olds - i.e., ""dumby, stupid and twerp.""

4370875,4,B004FPXMJC,I purchased these for my daughter when she was a huge hello kitty fan. The phase has past and she no longer shows much interest in them. Not too bad and a good price.,1378252800,,166,3.911764705882353
