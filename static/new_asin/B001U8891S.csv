8343126,5,B001U8891S,"I saw this show all the way through when it first came to American TV and enjoyed it, so it was really good to see the whole of it again and know I can watch it again when the mood strikes.",1514332800,,189,3.6341463414634148
8343127,5,B001U8891S,This tv series is awesome! Except for the Ruby character so irritating!,1459641600,,71,5.0
8343128,3,B001U8891S,"OK.  Expected more, got an ok show w/ some cool parts and some lame-ish parts.  One time view, won't re-watch like we do with several other shows.",1447718400,,146,4.37037037037037
8343129,5,B001U8891S,BBC's answer to Buffy.  Wonderful fun!  Region 2 DVD's will play on most newer laptops.,1427673600,,87,4.733333333333333
8343130,5,B001U8891S,"This is for 1 star reviwer, obviously you can't read. How can you blame others for your own stupidity? I take it you have bought other US released dvds and if you READ it tells you the region. It's not Amazons fault. Stop blaming others for your short comings.
DVD is great.",1388102400,3,274,4.288461538461538
8343131,1,B001U8891S,"So disappointed in Amazon!  Ever since BBC canceled the series I've been anxiously awaiting a DVD.  And voila!  It's here.  I trust Amazon.  Done business with then for years.  Never a disappointment.  Surprise!  Amazon has sold a DVD in the US that can't be seen on US players.  I was so excited when it arrived, only to be completely disappointed.  Shame on you for selling something we can't watch!  Should I know what Region 2 is?  Maybe.  Do most people?  No!  Now I'm reading all of the fine print instead of being able to trust Amazon.",1370995200,2,542,4.5
8343132,3,B001U8891S,"Full disclosure: I will watch Philip Glenister in almost anything. And fair warning: you need to have a multi-region DVD player for this one. The premise of the show is similar to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" with the nationalities flipped. Here the born-to-fight-demons teenager is English and male (and not very interesting) and his advisor is American - oddly, because he's played by the very British Glenister with a kind of film-noir American growl, or at least that must have been the idea. (The special effects are also iffy by current standards.) Glenister's watchable enough to stick with, accent or no accent, but the creators made a bigger mistake in focusing on the kids (in this case, the hero and his female best friend, who would clearly like to be more) when the adults are far more more interesting. The relationship between Glenister's character and the blind pianist Mina Harker really begged for more and was just getting there - in fact, the entire premise was ratcheting up - when the series came to an abrupt end. Teens and fans of Glenister may find it worth the investment. It isn't dull, merely unoriginal and a bit silly.",1364947200,6,1146,4.822335025380711
8343133,4,B001U8891S,This was a interesting tv series that never got a second series. And it's a shame as it like a uk version of buffy with a male lead. ALthough the other characters are mainly supernatural or trainers etc. The blu ray looks great but it is a region b blu ray so you need a all region player. This show was on bbc america a few years back as well. It features the lead character a decendant of van helsing out and about fighting demons mainly. A good romp of a show but it just never got a chance. It's less grim by far than 'the fades' another show that never made it past season one either.,1355702400,2,589,4.042735042735043
8343134,4,B001U8891S,"I think DEMONS is one of those love-it-or-hate-it type of shows.  The premise is interesting enough: A teenage boy learns he is decended from legendary monster-hunter Abraham Van Helsing.  He partners up with a friend of his late father's, as well as a woman called. . .Mina Harker?  Comparisons to Buffy the Vampire Slayer are inevitable (the trainer role in both shows is guy named Rupert, even), although Demons skews just a bit darker.

The short (six episodes?) first season has more highs than lows, and left this viewer wanting more.  The effects are well-done, and the atmosphere is suitably murky.  It's not hard to imagine the events in the show taking place in the same universe as, say, Torchwood.  If you like a dose of monsters with your action/adventure, you might find it to your liking.",1277078400,8,803,4.817518248175182
