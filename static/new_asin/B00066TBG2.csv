I bought this because I wanted to start a career in the  bartending profession. It has a lot of good information and enjoyable to watch. Good quality production. If you are trying to become a bartender or know someone that is , This is a good buy.",1331424000,2,321,4.35
8039410,5,B00066TBG2,"We bought the ""Fun To Know: Become a Professional Bartender"" as a gift for my daughter who wants to be a... well, a professional bartender and then ordered another one for ourselves. This is a very professionally produced video (we also make instructional videos) and was surprisingly entertaining as well as being very informative.

This contains bar basic (including the tools of the trade), correct procedures, popular drink recipes, tips and tricks, and dispelling bartending myths. While it is unlikely that watching this DVD will get you a job tending bar, but it might be a good start to see if this is a hobby or career that interests you.

Recommended!
