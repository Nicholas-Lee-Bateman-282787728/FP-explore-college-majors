7982121,5,B00008E1ML,"Let's just say this was a great season for the Miami Hurricanes albeit one that, alas, did not end with a national championship. At the ""U"" anything less than a championship is hard to swallow. But, this was a great season and this video captures it quite well. There was the dismantling of the Gators at the Swamp, the breathless comeback against the Noles at the Orange Bowl, and the great wins against BC, Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia.  Miami was loaded that year as well:  Ken Dorsey, Willis McGahee, Vilma, Andre Johnson, Kellen Winslow, Sean Taylor, DJ Williams, Joseph, and McDougle. This is a must for any Canes fan, even though the season ended with the robbery in the desert.",1077753600,,700,4.729508196721311
