8719090,4,B00YT9IXTS,"100 short biographies ranging 6-10 minutes on various leaders, entertainers, inventors etc.. They give a nice overview of the figure to sketch them out and seems to be culled from videos, pictures, newsreel. The narration is a bit dry but for brief overviews they are ok. Students would like them for biography projects or if you want information in short bursts. Easy interface to scroll through the names in the menu. There is an introduction  and ending that is repeated on each biography which pads out the bio.  Gets repetetive quickly so you may not want to watch a bunch all at once. But if you have an interest in certain people you will find them here. More modern people than historical figures but a nice reference tool for students.",1454457600,4,744,4.7153846153846155
