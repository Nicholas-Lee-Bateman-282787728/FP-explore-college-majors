2771463,4,B000NK0QUG,"This is a movie consistent with the old morals and ethics of that early time frame.  It is a morality play teaching about looking for character in a spouse, and the results of not choosing character over looks.  I liked Lillian Gish as an actress much better than Mary Pickford, in that she was more subtle in her expression and acting and consequently more realistic.",1220659200,4,368,4.6461538461538465
2771464,3,B000NK0QUG,"I've never understood why ""True Heart Susie"" has been held in such high esteem by some silent movie fans. It's a very good film, no doubt about it, but director D.W. Griffith made much better pictures, many in fact. Even from this period - ""The Greatest Question"", for example (and that's not even considering ""Broken Blossoms""). This film tells a sweet story and Gish is at her near-best, but it seems like Griffith isn't terribly interested. At any rate, this is a terrific quality print and certainly worthwhile. ""Hoodoo Ann"", the other film on offer here, wasn't directed by Griffith, which is probably a good thing, as it's not much of a movie. Entertaining, yes, but not one you'll want to watch over again.
Image has done great work in delivering excellent quality prints of silent classics, and they have done right by us here too. Hopefully though they'll release the great Griffith films which aren't available on dvd yet (including ""Isn't Life Wonderful"", ""Judith Of Bethulia"", ""Drums Of Love"", ""Sorrows Of Satan"", ""Lady Of The Pavements"", etc.)",1208995200,2,1056,4.938202247191011
2771465,5,B000NK0QUG,"This DVD is a special treat for silent film enthusiasts and anyone who longs for some good old-fashioned, sentimental and charming love stories of days gone by.  Both ""True Heart Susie"" and the second film on this disc, ""Hoodoo Ann"" were written and produced by `the father of film' D.W. Griffith who is generally remembered today as the director of landmark epics such as ""Intolerance"" and ""Birth of a Nation"", so it might come as a pleasant surprise to some to see this other side of Griffith's work.  ""True Heart Susie"", which Griffith also directed, is completely different from his historic epics of only a few years earlier, showing that he also had depth, sensitivity and compassion in filming this story of a simple country girl's unwavering love for her childhood sweetheart.  The simple essence of the story is about true love, and that the girls who use ""paint and powder"" are only temporary flirtations or mistakes men make, but true hearts like Susie's remain faithful and wait for their one and only true love. Along with superb acting by screen legend Lillian Gish whose face and demeanour suit innocent girl roles so well, Griffith brings out many delicate details and touching moments in the film, making it one of his best ever films next to another 1919 production also starring Lillian Gish, namely ""Broken Blossoms"".  It is fitting, therefore, that this DVD presents a beautiful, near-perfect remastered print of ""True Heart Susie"" along with a wonderful orchestral musical score by the highly-acclaimed Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, which greatly adds to the overall charm and tender mood of the story.

The second film, ""Hoodoo Ann"" also features experienced actors regularly used by Griffith in many earlier films, namely Mae Marsh and Robert Harron, who both starred in ""Intolerance"" in the same year, 1916.  In this light-hearted story of another sweet and innocent country girl, Mae Marsh is just as convincing as Lillian Gish with her girly manner, and Robert Harron is dependable and reliable as usual, playing Hoodoo Ann's suitor who is puzzled when Ann says she can't marry him.  But her reasons are all an amusing set of circumstances and misunderstandings, which make ""Hoodoo Ann"" simply a joy to watch.  Once again, attention to detail is important in this clever, light comedy romance, and everything fits together smoothly along with Mae Marsh's fine performance making Hoodoo Ann a believable character.  Picture quality is again extremely good, and it has a standard but very good piano accompaniment.  For anyone who'd like to escape to a simpler, idyllic past without heavy drama, these two easy-to-watch early silent films won't disappoint, and in fact, might increase appreciation for both D W Griffith's varied works and silent films generally.",1189641600,9,2793,5.091903719912473
2771466,5,B000NK0QUG,"I won't go into the plot of this movie, but is should suffice for me to say that this has to be one of the top, if not THE top Griffith film.  Griffith was famous for his epics.  Often, these were racist and very melodramic movies.  There is none of that in this little gem of the silent era.  Every thing in the story is simple and it flows along like a smooth, country stream.  Nothing controversial here, and we are treated to a story of young love set in an America that has all but disappeared.  The country setting, the daily activities of old time folk, all of this makes this movie a piece of old time Americana that silent film lovers cannot miss.  Who hasn't been in love and been hurt?  Ah, this film tugs at the heart strings!

I first discovered this wonderful gem twenty years ago when I bought a vhs copy from VideoYesteryear.  The print used was bad...dark, blurry.  I couldn't understand why none of the major video companies had not realeased a restored edition.  I used to hound KINO and MILESTONE Films about working on this movie.  Hats off to Image.  The print quality is excellent.  The music is good and goes well with the film, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the Rosa Rio score from my old YesterYear vhs copy.  If you love the silent era as much as I do, please treat yourself to what will become one of your favorite films.",1188432000,9,1354,4.292490118577075
2771467,4,B000NK0QUG,"While the focus of this DVD is on actresses Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh, it is Robert (Bobby) Harron who is of prime interest to me after watching these two films. Harron is best known for his role in Griffith's INTOLERANCE as the young man who is falsely imprisoned in the Modern Story (also with Mae Marsh). He also appears briefly but memorably in BIRTH OF A NATION as Lillian Gish's younger brother. Having recently rewatched that along with these movies I have come away with a much greater appreciation of his talent which makes his tragic death in 1920 at the age of 27 even more so. Harron whether conciously or not was a master of body language. Watch his character in SUSIE as he goes from awkward schoolboy to small town minister. The awkwardness remains but he subtly changes throughout which fits the role perfectly. Then check out his turn in HOODOO ANN where he's still shy but not awkward at all.

Actresses Gish and Marsh are given the opportunity to really inhabit their characters which they do with an ease and naturalness that belies their years of experience. They make it seem fresh even though they have played these types of roles many times. There are many great scenes throughout SUSIE which also features the ill-fated Clarine Seymour who would also die in 1920 at the age of only 21 and we get an early glimpse of Carol Dempster who would dominate Griffith's films (and his private life) in the 1920's. Several scenes in HOODOO including the burning of the orphanage and Harron and Marsh at the movies are quite memorable. The prints while not restored are in very good shape (especially SUSIE) although it's something of a puzzle that I have yet to see a fully restored D.W. Griffith film.

My one minor quibble is Rodney Sauer's score for TRUE HEART SUSIE. It's well performed but is just a little too quaint and old-fashioned in some scenes which undercuts some of the story. The score for HOODOO ANN enhances the film quite nicely. So let this DVD be your introduction to the wonderfully gifted but tragically short-lived actor Bobby Harron. Once you've seen him here it'll make you hungry for more. Aside from INTOLERANCE check out the Griffith BIOGRAPH SHORTS and HEARTS OF THE WORLD for an opportunity to see what he could do. Thanks to David Shepard and Film Preservation Associates for making this available.",1188345600,8,2345,4.717073170731707
8178970,4,B000NK0QUG,A true silent for some reason it has no musical score.,1501632000,,54,4.0
8178971,4,B000NK0QUG,"Spoiler alert!  Don't read any further if you want the entire plot to be a surprise.

The quality is probably the best that can be hoped for now, but it's such a shame that so many of these silent era films are in poor shape. Still, it's watchable and the story is touching, and probably more so for the real life stories of the cast members. Susie is supposedly a plain Jane simple girl, but of course it's Lillian Gish and she's the prettiest girl in the movie. Heh. But pretend you don't notice that. She's in love with a boy who plans to become the town pastor, played by Bobby Harron. When a party girl wearing makeup and silk stockings comes to town, he tells Susie that men might flirt with Jezebels like that, but they prefer to marry the simple country girls like Susie. Ha! Susie makes all kinds of sacrifices on his behalf, but of course he's a guy so he marries the Jezebel. Grrrrrr.

While watching this movie, you can't help seeing what D.W. Griffith must have seen when he looked at Bobby Harron. In his earlier films like Unseen Enemy, Harron was such a pretty boy!  But this was one of his last pictures and his boyish good looks were gone. He only made a few more films after this one, and then supposedly shot himself because he was depressed about being replaced by Richard Barthelmess in the pretty boy roles. Clarine Seymour also appears in this picture and dies from pneumonia in one scene. In real life she made only a few more films and then died from pneumonia at age 21. According to Wikipedia, Harron died the same year and so did Olive Thomas, and all of them were eulogized at a memorial service by director William Desmond Taylor, who would himself become one of the biggest news stories in history when he was murdered only two years later.

8178972,1,B000NK0QUG,"This Grapevine Video edition of ""True Heart Susie"" makes a wonderful film almost unwatchable. The washed-out and deteriorated print they used and the digital transcription of it are both seriously deficient. The more expensive edition of this film put out by Image Entertainment is far superior to this one in every way. It's worth the price for the Image Entertainment version, to fully enjoy this modest yet touching film from the prime years of Gish's career.",1445904000,,462,5.092105263157895
8178973,5,B000NK0QUG,This movie is a turning point in time...a depiction of the change from one generation (the 1910s) to another (the roaring twenties)...a preview of times to come...Clarine Seymour was certainly one of the first flappers and a rising star when this was made. Lillian Gish is very good in her role.(though she is anything but plain). DW Griffith is making a statement possibly about a time that was (the movie is set ten years back in 1909) and will no longer be. Well worth watching.,1424476800,2,481,4.670588235294118
8178974,5,B000NK0QUG,"This movie is not just another film from the silent era.  It is one of the greatest movies ever made...period.  I won't rehash its plot, which has been described here by others.  It is subtitled, The Story of a Plain Girl, and if you can get past the silly premise that Lillian Gish is ""plain looking,"" you will be blown away by this spectacular and underrated movie.

As a romantic comedy, this film is better than Chaplin's City Lights, which often tops the list (along with The General) as the greatest of silent films.  Whereas City Lights drags in scenes where the slapstick comedy seems passe and you reach unmercifully for the fast-forward button, THS has no dead frames.  No movie is flawless, and I could rack my brain for things to criticize, but THS is simply movie making when it was at its absolute BEST.  This is primarily due to the four principle people involved:  Miss Lillian Gish, Robert Harron, D.W. Griffith, and G.W. Bitzer.  Everyone talks about the first three, and rightfully so, but not enough credit and recognition is given to Billy Bitzer, Griffith's ace cameraman.  THS is beautifully photographed and his unique signature is all over this film.

The acting is superb among the entire cast (no surprises here) and Miss Gish truly shines throughout, rivaling anything she's ever done, including her great performances in Broken Blossoms and Way Down East.  There are too many good scenes in this movie to mention, but my favorite has to be the one where Susie stops in front of the soda shop and slowly eyes the sign advertising ""ICE CREAM DAY TO-DAY,"" then looks slyly at William.  No actress ever expressed herself with her eyes and facial gestures better than Miss Lillian Gish.

THS has a wonderful, heartwarming ending.  Forget that it's silent, hand tinted, and was made in 1919.  It doesn't need loud explosions or computer generated special effects because its story is timeless and it will be relevant many years from now...because there will always be a Susie and a William somewhere out there, even if that somewhere is a small, undiscovered planet in space.  And all this will take place long after Iron Man 3 has been forgotten.",1422748800,2,2170,4.790322580645161
8178975,4,B000NK0QUG,"A must-have for Mary Pickford fans! The films themselves are great and Mary is great in them! The video quality is very bad, but considering most of these films are over 100 years old, you can't expect them to be crystal clear. Also, very cheap packaging, $17.00 is a bit too overpriced for this, in my opinion, but you're probably not going to find these films anywhere else.",1372377600,,376,4.544117647058823
8178976,4,B000NK0QUG,"Although True Heart Susie is from the silent era of film and therefore, does not have audible dialogue, the movie shows off its characters in a way that their personalities can not be denied. One of my favorite ways in which this was accomplished was through the somewhat-sassy title cards that appeared through out the scenes. Not only were we able to see the character of Susie, but also of the other characters in the film.  True Heart Susie's personality is not only shown through the creative wording in the title cards, but also through the actress Lillian Gish who plays Susie. She manages to convey Susie's thoughts and emotions through the use of facial expressions, eye movement, and body language. One of my favorite examples is the quirky, little kick that Susie has at the beginning of the movie. Although not necessary to the plot of the film in itself, it is the little actions like that which draw in the audience and keep us wanting to watch the film.
I really liked this film. Seeing Susie's quirky personality kept me interested in the film. Because she was such a sweet girl, I really wanted her to succeed and to end up with her true love. The quality that she had of being lovable made it difficult, at times, to watch her get hurt by people over and over. By the end of the movie I was wondering if she would ever catch a break. Though the circumstances were sad, I was glad to see Susie's true feelings be known by the end of the film. I liked this film a lot and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of a quirky story about a girl who can't seem to let the boy she loves know that she loves him.",1305072000,5,1629,4.358552631578948
8178977,4,B000NK0QUG,"True Heart Susie is D.W. Griffith's tale of unrequited love. Susie is a plain country girl who likes the local fool William. William doesn't want to be a farmer and believes that college will open up new opportunities for him. Susie decides to sell her cow and secretely finance William's education. He comes back as a priest, but marries a promiscuous woman from out of town, leaving Susie forlorn and heart broken. It ends on a much happier note then that, but since I've summarized most of the plot, I'll leave the ending a surprise. The most impressive thing of Griffith's early drama was how he successfully displays the complexity of human relationships and behavior without any of the modern benefits and in an incredibly realistic sense. A rich man comes to town and promises to William he will finance the boy's education, but the check never comes. Susie does not make any dramatic attempts to woo William back to her after she finds out he's marrying a woman with less then ideal character (by the standards of their town). She instead simply accepts it and her life goes on. The quality of the acting, especially Lillian Gish's facial expressions, is very impressive for the time. Definitely get this if you want to enjoy a quality film from the medium's early years.",1303948800,6,1279,4.7657657657657655
8178978,4,B000NK0QUG,"True Heart Susie is a great film. The subtleties of camera angles, camera movement, foreshadowing, and lighting make this film. This film is the hallmark for the beginning of subtle acting--no more is there need for over exaggerated expressions like that that of German Expressionist films. The film does well to incorporate enter-titles that allow for more thought and interpretation.  This film is rather different for D. W. Griffith, but it is good. I highly recommend this film.  This film is exciting to watch and plays with societal norms and constraints. Susie has loved her neighbor for all her life but is cast aside when a new woman comes into town. It's interesting to notice the way in which the camera focuses on Susie's face and the little idiosyncrasies that she expresses. The relationship between Susie and Bettina is also quite noticeable in that Susie doesn't show anger or frustration towards her. She warmly helps her escape trouble; Susie knows that if Bettina were to be exposed, her love, William would be free to marry her, but oddly, Susie does not let Bettina face the trouble. This is an amazingly well done film that is far ahead of its time.  Lillian Gish pioneered the subtle acting and was revolutionary for her time. Audiences love her face/acting to this day. The audience can really relate to Susie. Even though this film is a silent film, it is surprising how well it is received today. The acting and story line are so unique, that many and all can enjoy the film. I would definitely recommend this film if one is looking for an entertaining short film. This is a good intro into the films of D. W. Griffith.",1303862400,,1645,4.744755244755245
