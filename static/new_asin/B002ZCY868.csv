4017511,4,B002ZCY868,"I happend to catch a commerical for this show on another network and it quickly caught my attention. It reminded me of Gilmore Girls which happened to be one of my favorite shows growing up as a teen! Now that I'm a bit older I wasn't sure how I would perceive this new family drama but decided to give it a shot! It hooked me from the very first episode! Life Unexpected is one of those shows that can make you laugh and cry all in one episode. It's a story about two people whose lives are quickly changed when the daughter they gave up at birth comes back into their lives 16 years later. Unfortunately Lux (Britt Robertson) has never been adopted and is now seeking emancipation so she can be on her own. But in order to do so she needs to seek out her biological parents to have them sign a form releasing her from foster care. However this story takes an UNEXPECTED twist when the judge decides to not grant her emancipation but instead put her back into the custody of her birth parents Cate (Shiri Appleby) and Baze (Kristoffer Polaha). Both having chosen different career paths, one successful as a host of her own radio morning show and secretly engaged to her co-host Ryan (Kerr Smith) and the other a bar owner whose life revolves around drinking and partying until the sun comes up are both suddenly thrown into parenthood! They are now forced to make decisions they have never made before which soon forces the two of them to have to grow up and become the parents they never had a chance to be! There are some twist and turns in the story but no matter what the show always ends on a positive note and never leaves the audience without a smile. Life Unexpected is a show that has laughs and tears but most of all it has a lot of heart!",1286064000,5,1750,4.322188449848024
4017512,5,B002ZCY868,"I watched the first episode of Life Unexpected back in January because the critic in the Philadelphia Inquirer insisted it was a family drama parents would not be embarrassed to watch with their teens.

Always on the lookout for something to do with my daughter that does not include using my credit card, I took his advice. I'm glad I did. Life Unexpected not only has a most intriguing premise, it also has great characters, smart dialogue and the cutest outfits on prime time television.

As for the story, this is how it goes:

On prom night, Baze (Kristoffer Polaha), (the most popular guy in high school) seduces Cate (Shiri Appleby) (a shy A student) only to ignore her the following Monday. When Cate tells Baze she is pregnant, he refuses to take responsibility for the baby. Without anybody to support her (her mother is an alcoholic, she doesn't even have her father's address), Cate gives her baby girl up for adoption. They will find the perfect family for her, they tell Cate, and she believes them.

Now sixteen years later, the girl, Lux (Britt Robertson), who was never adopted, is tired of living in foster care and wants to get emancipated. To do that she needs her birth parents to sign the papers.

So you see where this is going. Cate and Baze are about to receive the visit of their long stranded daughter. A visit that will make them confront a past and a relationship they thought long gone.

As the story starts Cate is a local celebrity in Portland (Oregon) where she host a radio talk show with her fianc Ryan (Kerr Smith), while Baze lives with two friends as a perpetual teenager over the bar he rents from his father. To take responsibility for a teenage daughter is not in their agenda. But when the judge instead of granting Lux the emancipation she seeks gives her biological parents temporary custody, Cate and Baze are forced into sudden adulthood. And they are not ready.

Although the show is not perfect (predictable and unrealistic, my daughter says) I love the characters and their drama. I love the fact that Cate and Baze, although they are the parents, are more immature in many ways than their daughter. I like Lux's resourcefulness, her independence and her vulnerability. And I love Ryan, the most understanding boyfriend ever.

So if you have not seen Life Unexpected yet, please buy the DVD when it comes out. Because, as of today, it has been renewed for another season.",1280448000,14,2420,4.691037735849057

4017644,2,B002ZCY868,"Kate got pregnant in high school. She did what she thought was best for the baby by giving her up for adoption. When Luz finds her and Baze the story revolves around making Kate the bad guy, and making her feel guilty for doing what she thought was best for Lux.  Every single episode is exactly the same. Lux thinks her life would have been so grand being raised by an unwed teenage mother. All of the characters blame Kate for her decision. No one holds Baze responsible for any part of the unplanned pregnancy. At one point Lux says, ""I don't know if I will ever be able to forgive you."", to Kate. Well, Baze did not even stick around long enough to be a part of the decision to place Lux for adoption. Where is the teenage rage against him?  Each and every episode is one step forward, two steps back with a lot of yelling and tears and walking away. This deserves one star for being rooted in misery and defeat, but I gave it a second star for the great music.",1463097600,,965,4.210810810810811

I wasn't sure sometimes who the adults were and who was the child.  Too many times both parents shared with their teenage daughter too much information.  There were no boundaries on what was innapproptiate behavior. Though it showed how much parents can learn from a child as much as a child can learn from adult, it wasn't realistic in many aspects.  Lux is an intelligent girl, but based on her past she seemed a little too grounded to me sometimes and got away with too much and not enough consequences.  She did what she wanted and when it didn't go her way she left.  Though I understand either parent not knowing how to be parents they treated  Lux more like a friend in their triangle of dramatic incident after dramatic incident.",1455062400,,889,4.5125

I watched seasons 1 & 2 twice, and wished that they had been able to continue production into a third season.

Good social issues, and growing pains of teenagers as well as adults who haven't really done it yet.  Again a show that should have been renewed for at least one more year.",1439942400,,342,4.230769230769231

4018199,5,B002ZCY868,"I liked this show when it was on the air.  I especially liked Lux and Jones.  I was intrigued by how he was into her from the day he first met her.  She was so obviously different from him.  He was into her, she was not that in to him, at first. He came from money, she came from foster care.  He had a two parent family.  She just met her parents.  He was a popular quarter back.  She dressed in Seattle grunge.  He was calm and she was spicey.  They didn't show enough interaction between the two.  I actually stopped watching the show during the second season because of the student starting a relationship with a teacher story line between Lux and Eric.  As a teacher, that irritated me.  Fortunately, the series finale fixed that mistake.",1360972800,,743,4.335766423357664
4018200,5,B002ZCY868,"I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE CW HAS DROPPED THE BALL AND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR CANCULING SUCH A GREAT SHOW. THEY'D RATHER SELL TNA AS OPPOSED TO HAVING LIFE UNEXPECTED KEEP GOING. I FOR ONE AM A BIG FAN OF THIS SHOW, IT SHOWS THEE UNAMERICANA FAMILY, THERE ARE NO APPLE PIES LEAVE IT TO BEAVER LIVES HERE. IT SHOWS TWO PARENTS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH THIS CHILD, TWO UNMARRIED PARENTS AT THAT. WE LIVE IN A NEW TIME AND NEW FAMILY VALUES. I FOR ONE AM WONDERING WHY THE CW CANCULED THIS SHOW. OWE I KNOW IT WASN'T LINING THERE ALREADY FAT POCKETS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS SELL THE T N A, THAT LINES THERE POCKET, I FOR ONE DON'T THINK GOSSIP GIRL IS ANY GOOD, WHY NOT CANCUL THAT. I KNOW ONE TREE IS ON IT'S WAY OUT, BUT I LIKE THAT SHOW, OR AT LEAST SO FAR...SEEING THAT I AM BARELY ON SEASON TWO. ANYHOWS I WOULD SO MUCH LOVE FOR THE CW TO RECONSIDER AND GIVE US BACK THE UNEXPECTED. I GOT DEPLOYED LAST YEAR WHEN THE SHOW WAS BARELY ON IT'S SIXTH EPISODE SO I HAD TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR, AND SOME CHANGE FOR IT SO FINALLY COME OUT ON DVD, SO I AM CURRENTLY WATCHING IT AND I TELL YOU THAT IT TUGS AT ONE'S EMOTIONAL STRINGS.

4018203,5,B002ZCY868,"lif unexpected should be the new show everyones talking about, it brings everything to the table and has a great cast to pull it off. the chemistry between this gang is amazing! the show is both simple and complicated, and just down right enjoyable. it has the perfect combination of wit and humour.

so what is it about? family. and well how life can be unexpected but you ahve to roll with the punches. Lux, a witty teen has pretty much raised herself, she's only really ever had herself to depend on and after nearly 16 years in the foster care system she wants out so she has control on her life. to do that first her birth parents have to sign the papers that were scewed up way back when, in her bid to get emancipated lux tracks down her birth father. Baze was the popular charming jock in high school and he never quite grew up, he lives above the bar he owns and relies mostly on his wealthy family, then the daughter he didn't know had been born knocks on his door. which leads to them finding cate. Cate was the smart loner in high school but now is a narotic, commitmentphobic radio dj who is in a relationship with her co host ryan, she has issues and lots of them. not too surprising she's not a baze fan after he got her pregnant and then refused to take responsibility for it, isntead of having an abortion cate gives her daughter up for adoption believing lux will be adopted to an amazing family that wants children. so cate is both thrilled and pretty peeved when lux comes back into her life.

a twist of fate leads lux back into the custody of her biological parents and together cate, baze, lux and ryan must discover how to work as a family. and what an adventure it is.",1286755200,6,1693,4.304075235109718
4018204,5,B002ZCY868,This show is so addictive i wish it was out now. I watch every week. There are not very many quality shows on T.V. right now so im glad that this is on for people who want to see a series with heart.,1286582400,,199,3.6511627906976742
8384708,2,B002ZCY868,Blah. Nothing stands out in this show and it almost trivialized the fostering of unwanted children. Very predictable and shallow portrayals of characters except for Lux,1511049600,,168,5.5
8384709,2,B002ZCY868,Turning this situation into a comedy strikes me very odd.  Lots of strange messages in this show you can see them if you a informed about the state of foster care system and the abuse that goes on.,1508630400,,197,4.184210526315789
8384710,2,B002ZCY868,"Have you seen a Hallmark movie? like any Hallmark movie? Well this is just one that will never end. The men are the only characters who are logical and are responsible in this show. The women are flighty, quirky, and down-right obnoxious. Cate the ""mother"" of the show has absolutely no responsibility and blames all her problems on everyone but herself. The saying ""like mother like daughter"" is never so true, because Lux is exactly the same. At first you feel bad for her because she bounced around from foster home to foster home but then you see that she blames all her issues on everyone and is unable to change herself for the better. Characters change but they start out from being okay to down-right wanting to punch in the face. Natasha is the only female who transforms into a young responsible woman. And there end of rant hopefully you just stick to Hallmark movies.",1496102400,,879,4.641025641025641

In one episode Theresa celebration in which the parent GIVES THE CHILD A GLASS OF ALCOHOL!! Sure, he says "" one glass"" but wow. Really?!?
