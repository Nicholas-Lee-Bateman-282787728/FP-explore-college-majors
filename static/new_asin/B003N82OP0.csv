4156554,1,B003N82OP0,"This whole production was so impressed with itself -- serving up tepid 4th rate Monty Python rehashes, several of Bob Odenkirk's sketch characters, clumsy overly-obvious music, and one of the most abrasively hideous lead performances in recent film history. I'm sure the commentaries or interviews will claim this man was the ""only one"" who could play this part, but boy -- if they started off with a better actor in that central role and toned down the medical-marijuana-while-watching-Python-DVDs-in-the-background-and-pecking-at-Final-Draft screenwriting excesses they might have had something here. As it is, they have nothing. Avoid this terrible film and see films by directors doing something original and clever. You want Super 8mm? Go watch Guy Maddin movies. Support good art and let horrible crap like this get buried in your queue.",1343865600,2,843,5.542635658914729
4156555,2,B003N82OP0,"This movie is a dark comedy and involves eccentric characters, which is my favorite type of movie.  But, most of the humor and characters are over the top.  The acting and dialogue are very deliberate in trying to be funny and different.  I'm not sure what the movie is trying to be.  It seems more like it is mocking a Wes Anderson movie. I'd understand if that was the case, but I don't think it was.  Overall, two stars.",1342742400,,423,4.30379746835443
4156556,5,B003N82OP0,This was a wonderfully written and acted film. Mike O'Connel's portrayal and story of a true eccentric on his final day was a wonderful journey through an incredible imagination. Definitely recommend this movie.,1330819200,,211,5.424242424242424
4156557,4,B003N82OP0,"I was very please with this movie. I wasn't sure.
I'm a Film Festival worker, photographer, fan, and attender.
I'm also a huge movie-buff, and not in the 'fan girl' way/s.

And, I find that.. despite both of the above.. I'm not always impressed with some of these films, and certainly don't always agree with the reviews/critics. However, in this case, I was very happy. I don't have any complaints, really. I know that doesn't sound ""oh, no complaints, I MUST see this, then"". But really, this was a very-well done movie, in all aspects. You didn't end the movie on a note that you dislike - you are satisfied with the ending. And, sometimes, that's one of the biggest downfalls of many Festival favourites. I bought this used, and was more-than-okay with the condition - it was not worn at all, and was truly a bargain. However, I buy movies in 'bulk', really, and don't like paying more than 5$ per movie, considering I buy them dozens/hundreds at a time; so this was excellent for me.

I recommend a watch of this film. Even if you don't decide to buy.",1308787200,,1056,4.523560209424084
4156558,2,B003N82OP0,"Mike O Connell is a little too over-the-top for my taste; Jesse Eisenberg was spot on.  I was drawn to the quirkiness of it, but was somewhat disappointed. I think I'll have to watch it again. My three friends fell asleep about 1/3 of the way through; a poor testimonial.",1308355200,4,271,4.42
4156559,1,B003N82OP0,"Sucked, Avoid, Mundane, horrible accents that get intolerable! The Social Network kid (Jesse Eisenberg) is in this and he does about as horrible of an acting job from The Social Network, also garbage! Sorry kiddies. Although he was Great in Holy Rollers.",1302048000,,254,5.071428571428571
4156560,5,B003N82OP0,"I agree that this movie is similar to Wes Anderson. It's a great dark comedy, for me it had many laugh-out-loud moments. It's wonderfully absurd. And on Netflix right now! I'll probably buy it because I love it so much, but if you already have Netflix and you don't feel like spending $20 I would do that :)",1301529600,,307,4.310344827586207
4156561,5,B003N82OP0,"This movies is really excellent.  It has an interesting premise, has loads of dark humor and is infinitely quotable.  If you like quirky dark comedies you will like this one.  It is in the ball park of a Wes Anderson or Cohen Bros. movie.  Certainly worth your time and money.  It is just a shame that the movie is so small most people won't ever see it.  It has cult classic written all over it.",1301184000,2,396,4.213333333333333
4156562,5,B003N82OP0,When I first saw this at a special screening in Chicago a few years ago I was blown away by how incredible it was. Too bad I had to wait until late 2010 to get my hands on a copy. I recommend everyone catch this genre defying epic,1283644800,5,230,3.8125

8400755,5,B003N82OP0,"I admit that the first twenty minutes or so upon my first viewing of The Living Wake I was not completely engaged with it, the subtleties of its whimsy losing out to another activity, perhaps doing push-ups or reading, I can't recall. In fact, I am ashamed to admit, it wasn't until the closing did I begin to realize how charming this little indie picture had been, my attention earned with gratitude in its finale which gave me a sudden sentimentality, a reason for reconsideration. And thus, I immediately replayed the film convinced I had entirely missed out on something very special. I was right. The Living Wake has since become one of my favorites, a film which I watch from time to time to still find amusing and even profound thematic elements, along with some very comedic dialogue and performances. This isn't to say everyone will love this film as much as I or even at all. It's quirkiness I suppose could be considered pretentious or even self-aware, but I can think of a dozen or more far guiltier films to condemn for such attributes. It tends to be darkly comical, almost an absurdity in its regard of death, a gaping melancholy always in its heart, but in its treatment of the futility we face in our own mortality, seen through the grandiose eccentricity of its protagonist searching for meaning on the last day of his life, dealing with universal fears of leaving without making some kind of lasting impression in his short time here, it transcends its bleakness to be inspiring and an uplifting affair. K. Roth Binew, portrayed wonderfully by Mike O'Connell, is an exaggeratedly flawed character, at times unlikable, but always entertaining and as the film precedes, identifiable and indeed quite funny throughout. Jessie Eisenberg, as the straight man to the obnoxious Binew, Mills Joquin, gives another outstanding performance as does Jim Gaffigin as Binew's long lost father. The film is unique in its amalgamation of narrative devices, from song to poetry to comedy to drama (kind of like a one-man show), but this episodic structuring services the story well and lends to its charisma. In my recommendation of this movie I must attach the disclaimer that it is like a well-written stage play and so if this kind of pacing does not suit one's taste it will most likely be received unfavorably. I have found The Living Wake to be a cherished treasure that I hope many other's will enjoy as much as I do.",1353974400,3,2427,4.780952380952381
8400756,4,B003N82OP0,"This is a clever, witty and original dark humour comedy and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I'd give it 5 stars but the audio is not great quality so some of the pithy dialogue is hard to hear.  I had no idea what to expect and found myself unexpectedly amused.  Worth repeat viewings.",1346803200,,284,4.222222222222222
