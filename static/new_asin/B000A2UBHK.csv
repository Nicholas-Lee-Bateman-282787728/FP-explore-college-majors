2351835,1,B000A2UBHK,"This second release of The Batman contains another three episodes: The Man Who Would Be Bat (Man-Bat), The Big Chill (Mr. Freeze), and The Cat and the Bat (Catwoman).

I'll be one of the first to say that The Batman as a series won me over in its second season. Canada has already gotten all the episodes, and certain ones like the appearances of Grundy, Hugo Strange, and Riddler really up the fun factor to a stylish and exciting level. However, this dvd still contains episodes from the first season, which means we're getting rather poor stories with bad dialogue offset by strong animation and interesting character designs. It's a shame really, as the new Man-Bat design is far scarier than the old BTAS one, and giving Mr. Freeze mutated ice powers (ala Marvel's Iceman) is a decent twist. But these villains lack characterizations and motivations - having Kirk Langstrom transform into Man-Bat simply to be a ""better bat"" than Batman doesn't do it for me. The Catwoman episode is fairly decent, though it still lacks a certain spark to make it memorable.

Also, WHV isn't making anyone happy with its cheap 3 episodes/disc release pattern, with few substantial bonus features. Why every release can't be as good as the Teen Titans discs is a mystery to me.

There's really no reason to get this disc. Wait for more episodes or when WB finally puts the Clayface finale on dvd.",1121212800,11,1383,4.754166666666666

8072718,1,B000A2UBHK,"I love batman, but this version of batman is by far the worst version ever created (including all the live action, animation, or comic book versions of batman).  I have no clue why they are wasting animation resourses on a crap cartoon like this, when they could be putting it toward quality cartoons like Justice League.  Warner Bros. needs to get a clue.  I might not be a kid anymore (I'm the ripe old age of 21), but if I ever have kids I can promise you they will not be allowed to watch this.  They will be watching all of the Batman the animated series dvds that I bought last month.  Please parents (and kids) go buy those dvds (or superman the animated series, or justice league, or batman beyond, or x-men, or even teen titans) instead of wasting your money on this crapola.",1143504000,,784,4.379310344827586
8072719,1,B000A2UBHK,"This version of Batman is for morons! My 12 years old cousin came to my house to stay in Christmas week. He told me that he watch this miserable show on TV. He told me about the atrocities that criminal producer Sam made with Batman.

I told him that I have Batman cartoons in my DVD stand and he told me he wanted to watch it. Immediately, I picked up my two seasons of the 90's Batman TAS serie and my four animated movies for him to watch. So I put him to watch the first season of Batman TAS. And guess what? He LOVED IT! He also told me he wanted a copy! He told me as we was watching ""Uncle, I like this cartoons more than the ones on TV"".

Do yourself a favor: avoid like the plague this DVD and buy a Scooby Doo cartoon for your kid, instead of this. He will thank you.",1134950400,3,777,3.911392405063291
8072720,2,B000A2UBHK,"Negative...

The 1st season of The Batman was ok, but the second season ruled...third season is mediocre so far.  I want the second season.  The only worthwhile episode on this disc is ""The Big Chill"".  The other 2 are lack luster.  The Big Chill had a lot of stale ""Freeze"" jokes, but was well presented.

A 2 out of 5 stars.",1133308800,,326,4.262295081967213
8072721,1,B000A2UBHK,"This show is not Batman, not even B:TAS.  Batman and his villains are done very incorrectly.  This ranks as low as Teen Titans Go.

It's too bad kids can't get any decent comic shows nowadays.  At least Smallville for the teen crowd has it's moments.",1131062400,3,250,4.488888888888889

The second season is better, but still garbage. They should focus more on Justice League Unlimited. Now, THAT is a show worth watching!",1126569600,3,309,4.254237288135593
