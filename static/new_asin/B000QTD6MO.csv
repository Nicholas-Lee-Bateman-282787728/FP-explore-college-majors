It begins with a song about leaving Cheyenne. Riders approach a camp and start shooting at the people there. Tex and Duke see this and ride after them, shooting. A young woman mourns her father. Kalmus receives the report from Red about shooting Summers, the freight company owner. But one wagon arrives in town. Two trips a week are needed to hold the franchise. Madge Summers tells the Marshal what happened. The Judge also runs the Owl Saloon. He dispenses justice for the Tonto Basin. Tex and Duke are hired to entertain; Tex sings, Duke picks. Kalmus suggests to the Judge that Tex and Duke may have attacked the Summers wagons!

Tex and Duke bed down for the night, but they will drive the Summers wagon to hold the franchise. Red is told to do a good job and attack the wagon. First Duke then Tex seem to be shot! But this is a ruse, the wagon gets to town. Red calls Tex to meet the Judge, who complains about his working for Summers. Then Red starts a fight with Tex. Tex wins, he and Duke back out with drawn guns. Tex sings again. Madge explains why the freight line is important to the valley. Tex returns to his room. Red follows and stabs the figure on the bed! Tex grabs him from behind and takes away the knife. They continue the struggle, Reds own gun fires. Reds friends arrest Tex, Kalmus charges him with murder.

The judge holds a trial in the Owl Saloon. Duke brings Red down, he is alive! But Red is shot before he can talk! The Judge locks them in jail. Tex sings again. Four shopowners talk to Tex about the need to stand up to the Kalmus gang. Tex tries to get the keys, and succeeds. Kalmus stirs up the crowd to attack the two strangers, but they are gone. Kalmus takes his men to attack the freight wagons. There is a running gun battle, men fall from their horses. One of these is Kalmus. The Archer-Summers Freight Line continues in business, there is a long line of wagons now. The small businesses should prosper now.

This is a story about commercial rivalry where one man tried to get a monopoly on the freight business so he could charge higher prices. This echoes the 1877 hard coal war in Pennsylvania where the railroad owner raised the shipping charges so the mine owners could not profit and were forced to sell out to the railroad owners. Other westerns were inspired by the Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming where the corporate cattle ranch tried to drive out the small ranchers and homesteaders to take their lands.",1510272000,,2491,4.456140350877193
