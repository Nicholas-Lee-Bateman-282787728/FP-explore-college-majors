6757230,4,B00OMCLMNQ,"Lucio Fulci's almost forgotten gem ""The Psychic""(aka:Five Notes In Black) is not only one of the maestro's most brilliant pieces of cinema but it's more so proof that the god of gore could make a thriller just as creepy as ""The Beyond"",""House By The Cemetary"" and ""Zombi 2"" with out large amounts of blood and gore. Dardano Sacchetti penned up a whopper of a giallo here and Fulci and the rest of the film crew(actors/musicians/editors/costume designers and such) did a mesmerizing job bringing Sacchetti's story/screenplay to life. As a big Lucio Fulci fan I am more than delighted to add this masterpiece to my collection. Great film!",1200614400,3,636,4.953271028037383
6757231,4,B00OMCLMNQ,"The Psychic AKA Seven Notes in Black sort of marked an end of Fulci's career, but started another career for him. Lucio Fulci like I always say was a filmmaker who sparked debates among horror fans. Some love him and others see him as a no talent splatter director, but before Fulci became a splatter director he did some top notch Giallo work that sadly went over-looked.

If you're looking for what became the typical Fulci movie loaded with a high body count and a whole lot of gore well you best look elsewhere. Most of the violence happens off camera and what we see gore wise is very, very little. The Psychic was made back before Fulci started his splatter era, which was only 2-years away. Many people feel Fulci was a lousy filmmaker, but I have to disagree. Even in his splatter era he was a good filmmaker. He knew how to build tension, but it was often over-looked due to poor dubbing, an incoherent plot, idiotic characters and a whole lot of the red stuff.

With The Psychic, Fulci attempts to tell a story using filmmaking skills rather than blood. And he sort of did that in some areas, but in others The Psychic just didn't work. The Psychic is a very slow burn type movie that relies on story and characters and there is a little bit of a problem.

The screenplay was written by Lucio Fulci, Roberto Gianviti and Dardano Sacchetti, but according to Sacchetti, Lucio didn't write a single word to the movie. He would show up at meetings and say what he liked or disliked, but never actually wrote. I don't see what Sacchetti would gain from lying, but since Fulci is credited I will acknowledge him as a writer regardless of what's true. From a writing stand-point The Psychic had all the right ideas. And all the ideas were mostly executed well. But the problem was the characters.

The Psychic is one of those movies where you really can't tell who's who. None of the characters have much depth and honestly after the movie is over you'll be hard pressed to remember any of the names of the characters. The Psychic relies on story and characters, and while the story is pretty much there it's the characters that aren't. They're all as thin as the paper they were written on. If this was a Fulci splatter flick it really wouldn't matter. But when a movie relies on story and characters without one it just won't totally work.

There is a nice mystery surrounding the story and it really does work well for the most part; but without the characters it does hurt a little bit. I'm not really familiar with Roberto Gianviti besides Murder Rock, which he wrote and Fulci directed. Dardano Sacchetti is one of the biggest names in Italian cinema if not the biggest horror writer. You name the cult classic he did it and several of those were with Lucio Fulci.

The screenplay is quite interesting and mostly moves forward. It's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle with the psychic visions. The lead character Virginia Ducci played by Jennifer O'Neil has to piece them all together and it does make for an interesting premise, but again I go back to the weak characters. In general horror movies often don't have the best developed characters and one can argue Fulci and Sacchetti never really wrote a lot of movies that featured well developed characters. Overall like I said the screenplay works well but the characters are what hurt it.

Lucio Fulci fairs much better as a director, but there is only so much he can do. The first hour of The Psychic can be quite slow, but Fulci manages to keep the pace moving at a pretty good, but slow pace. You might find yourself slightly bored at times, but Fulci manages to keep the plot going and keep the viewer interested for the most part. The final 30-minutes are quite good and as good as you'll find in any Giallo. The chase scene towards the end is probably the finest Fulci ever put together.

The visual look also really helps. Lucio Fulci along with DP Sergio Salvati create a great visual look. These two have worked together many times and most of Fulci's best movies were with Salvati. The scenes are well lit and give an eerie feel and Fulci loves the eyes and you get plenty of close up of the eyes. When used in the right situation that can really add to the tension, but when used at the wrong time it fails. Here, Fulci uses it at the right times and it adds to the tension.

The Psychic does feature a lot of nice plot twists that really add to the movie and proves Fulci was more than just a gore director and for the most part The Psychic is coherent. I would say The Psychic is one of Fulci's more solid movies, but just lacks with the characters. The plot mostly always moves forward and it worked quite well, but again I just found the characters lacking. Even with those flaws I would say this is one of Fulci's better movies. It's not as good as Don't Torture a Duckling, but better than a lot of Fulci's work in the 80s.

The Psychic is one of the sort of forgotten Lucio Fulci movies and it really deserves a wider audience. The movie has its fair share of flaws, but it's also a solid Giallo that mostly moves forward with the plot. Fans of Fulci will wanna seek this one out and even those who dislike Fulci might wanna give this one a try. Besides the visual look this isn't the Fulci most people know. There is hardly any blood and it's mostly coherent. Not a perfect film, but a solid movie in Lucio Fulci's career.",1198368000,6,5398,4.443434343434343
6757232,4,B00OMCLMNQ,"What a masterpiece. Most of you know Lucio Fulci as being the king of over the top gore and violence with films like The Beyond, Zombie, and House By the Cemetery. Fulci is much more reserved in this quiet subdued thriller yet  the film is still one of his strongest works. Instead of the gore he uses much more suspense and build up and keeps you guessing throughout. The film has that 70's glaze which I love and amazing poster art as well. I just recently picked up an original 1977 print of the poster. Don't miss this movie. It is way overlooked and needs to be necessitated.

8684273,3,B00OMCLMNQ,"First off, this is a DVD-R, so don't expect the ""Digitally Remastered"" quote on the front of the DVD cover. It is mainly a port from a VHS tape in the fullscreen mode. If you don't want to pay the big bucks it would cost for the legitimate widescreen version of the film, this would be your next choice. Even though the transfer is from VHS, the colors are strong and the film is interesting enough to let you forgive the DVD-Rs shortcomings. For those who don't want to empty their wallet on the long OOP legitimate DVD release. And it's Lucio Fulci. So what's not to like?",1422057600,7,574,4.324074074074074
8684274,4,B00OMCLMNQ,"Jennifer O'Neill is one of my favorite scream queens, and she gets a pretty ideal starring role here. The mostly undiscovered movie is beautifully shot and costumed, and O'Neill's Virginia lives a life of luxury, seeing her husband off on a charter plane at the beginning of the movie (everything shot in fabulous 1970s disco-dreamy hazy shades of brown), then driving herself to a country house she plans to renovate. Only along the way she has a very complicated vision (triggered by tunnels along the highway) that reminds her of the one she had as a child, when she saw her mother die. Her vision leads her to take an ax to a wall in the abandonded house, where she unearths a skeleton. The more she finds out about her vision, the more doomed she begins to feel, but she's drawn to her fate like a moth to a flame. The film is full of odd characters.

There's an intriguing mystery women whom we never actually see at the same time we hear her speak; a parapsychologist who has a ditzy but amazingly organized secretary; a sister-in-law who identifies herself as shallow and unfocused; and a museum director who keeps cutting and regrowing his beard. This film came out a year before ""Eyes of Laura Mars,"" and there are a lot of similarities (though the American film is more of a consistent thriller, and this film is more of a Gothic mystery). Another film it brings to mind is ""Don't Look Now"" (1973) which has a very similar vibe of psychic insight leading to danger and doom. In the end, due to the Bulgari jewelry, the luxurious coats, the lurid colors, the recurring imagery and the haunting score by Fabio Frizzi, I'd call this film a forgotten gem.

BTW, there are two special features, despite the Amazon specs above: an original trailer, and a documentary that layers revealing interviews with significant crew members over scenes from the film.",1401494400,,1861,4.670731707317073
8684275,4,B00OMCLMNQ,"1977's ""The Psychic"" is a later Lucio Fulci ""giallo"" that is quite good even though his later period follows on its heels.  His famous gore period started in 1979 with ""Zombie.""  Although the plot of ""The Psychic"" is a bit of a gimmick, it is almost as good as ""Perversion Story"" and ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" two much earlier giallos, and in some ways, perhaps better.  With ""Perversion Story"", it is the acting that brings down the film as an excellent, and dare I say for Fulci, any ""masterpiece""?  And with Fulci's films, it is always a technical flaw that mars his film from any brilliance, something that as a competent director of many genres, he would have this notch taken care of.  Jennifer O'Neil and others in the cast are all competent.  But something I must comment on, Severin's transfer is really good, what with many reviewers saying Severin dropped the ball with ""The Psychic,"" at least the anticipated problems with the low sound were not on my copy, especially as the silences were ""cranked up"" by Severin screaming with ""white noise.""  Even the accompanying trailer (DVD also contains another extra) is noted ""thankfully"" supplied it's much maligned condition adding to the rarity of the film.  Not a complete success upon release, I remember ""the triumph"" of Fulci's ""Zombie"" a few years later was that it was held over in a few theaters to accommodate the crowds it drew.",1371513600,,1395,4.783333333333333
8684276,5,B00OMCLMNQ,"I have gone through at least 3 different releases of this film including an unwatchable VHS copy and finally, Severin Films got it right. This is a beautiful transfer and gives you the ability at seeing how underrated Lucio Fulci's photographic compositions were when he believed in a project. Over the years, this film got a raw deal because it is not excessively gory as his later works.  The film emerges as the closest Fulci reached in creating a macabre tone poem.  Back in the mid eighties, I used to work at the Galleria Mall in White Plains, New York and Jennifer O 'Neill used to frequent my shop quite regularly as a customer, she loved progressive rock music. She had a horse farm in the area. When I asked her about this film, she had fond memories of the shoot and was quite proud of it.  'Sette Note in Nero' its original title and Luchino Viscontis' 'L'Innocente'-'The Innocent' were her favorite European films.  I hope she got a copy of this transfer, I think she would be really pleased and proud as to how it holds up in the digital age. If only Lucio Fulci could have seen his poem get its just rewards.  Thank you, Severin.",1274659200,4,1144,4.480769230769231
8684277,4,B00OMCLMNQ,"Tonight I closed my eyes and pointed my finger towards my Horror collection and this is what I picked to enjoy.  Well, after finally getting around to watching my copy of Lucio Fulci's 'The Psychic' -aka- 'Seven Notes in Black', I stood up and gave a little personal clap for the film. haha.  'The Psychic' was another blind buy for me and I must admit, I don't think I'd have given it a chance had it not been for Fulci's name and that beautiful cover art!  I say that because that was a time when I had just started collecting Horror films and was extremely picky.  Well, I'm not too much like that anymore haha.  However, I remember being awed by the cover art when I was a little kid but never rented it.  Anyway, back to this flick.  If watching this for the first time and thinking your going to see the usual Fulci film, your dead wrong!
This isn't nothing like 'Zombie', 'The Beyond', or 'House By the Cemetery' etc.  I don't mean that in a bad way either.  The beginning of this flick may start off like what you're used to seeing as far as bloodiness goes but then it takes an unfamiliar turn for the next 45 to 50 minutes with full character development.  There's a lot of talky talky going on in this film but it works!  Then it cranks back up around 60 to 65 minutes in!!!  The story comes together nicely and has a creepy music score.  It seems almost sort of a Giallo film.  All in all, I wouldn't want to see this film put together any other way.  During those ""slow"" parts, there are bloody visions to be seen from our main character, Jennifer (Scanners) O'Neil, who has the misfortune of being given psychic abilities since she was young in seeing clues that lead towards ones death!  Poor mom.  Could her next visions lead towards her own deadly fate, as well!?  Since she has all the clues, could she somehow change things!?  You just have to see for yourself!  Warning: This film may not be for all Fulci fans.",1266278400,3,1931,4.340782122905028
8684278,5,B00OMCLMNQ,"Watching the beautiful Jennifer O'Neill is one of the many treats of this truly great cinematic experience. ""The Psychic"" suprises in the typical giallo style, but it is so much more. It literally transcends the genre and becomes a truly psychological masterpiece. Lucio Fulci casts a spellbinding trance and never lets the viewer go.
 Having seen many of Lucio Fulci's horror/gore flicks done after this amazing title, I wish he could have made more of these slice of death flicks. The only complaint which is slight; the audio on the Severin disc is relatively low. I had to really crank up my hi-fi. One of Fulci's best movies. Highly recommended.",1223078400,5,650,4.909090909090909
8684279,2,B00OMCLMNQ,Very poor film with even worse transfer to DVD. I literally had to turn up the volume to its loudest just to barely hear what was being said. This movie stinks now and even by standards of the day it was made it stinks. I'm afraid that's the kindest I can be to this film.,1209513600,3,272,3.963636363636364
8684280,1,B00OMCLMNQ,"Just have to say the transfer for this DVD is terrible.  There all these lines all over the picture, especially when there is any movement.  It's terribly jarring and ruined my enjoyment of this Fulci giallo.  If you can't see these lines, I'm going to assume you didn't watch it on an HDTV.  I'm quite annoyed with Sevrin for releasing this shoddy project.  It's unfortunate that Blue Undeground or the old Anchor Bay didn't get this license, becuase they would've found good transfers for it!  Sadly we have b-rate companies like Shriek Show and now Sevrin who just want to do a lazy job and collect a quick profit instead of preserving these genre films for future generations.  Save you money and go buy some Fulci films from Blue Underground instead.

I must also say I found this Fulci giallo to be over-rated and pretty boring at points.  However, I can't make a a confident review of it since my enjoyment was obviously effected by all those lines on the screen.  However, I will say that A Woman in the Lizard's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling are probably far superior to it at this point.  Hopefully, some day this film and Lizard will get a decent DVD release.",1202515200,4,1174,4.569377990430622
