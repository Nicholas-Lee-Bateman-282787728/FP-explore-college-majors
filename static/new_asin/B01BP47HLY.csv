7664736,5,B01BP47HLY,"Real, transparent, and inspirational, ""Laughing in the Dark"" provides behind-the-scenes insights to the amazingly gifted comedienne,Chonda Pierce and her life. Chonda shares the cost of giving joy to so many people for so many years, including shades of depression, her husband's alcoholism and subsequent traumatic death, grief, despair and fractured family that have impacted her world. Not just a morose, sad commentary of the costs of being in the entertainment business, this documentary alleviated moments of heart-ache and intensity with clips of Chonda in her shows, as she laughed with the audience at her jokes and also shared the lighter side of her ability to process some of the challenges she has faced (faces?). This film is absolutely inspirational for any of us who have experienced challenges like these or similar...She is an amazing lady.",1461283200,,858,5.362962962962963
7664737,5,B01BP47HLY,"This story was told in such a beautiful but raw account.  I recently lost my husband and it was so comforting that some of the words she spoke were exact words that I had spoken myself.  I thought this would have been sad, but it was not, it was full of hope and peace.  I would recommend this to everyone!!",1461283200,,307,4.083333333333333

7664739,5,B01BP47HLY,I've followed Chonda since she spoke at a small ladies dinner when she first started her career.  This is an amazingly honest testimony of an amazing woman.,1461110400,5,156,4.777777777777778

7664741,5,B01BP47HLY,"A very brave, emotional, and extraordinary movie.  Be sure to watch the full interview of David and Chonda in the special feature section.  David's bravery to share in his addiction was very moving and I believe both his and Chonda's story will help many, many others who are struggling in their lives.",1460505600,19,302,4.788461538461538
7664742,5,B01BP47HLY,"Chonda Pierce, Laughing in the Dark, is a very candid, truthful account of life, death, and comedy. It is courageous, compelling, open, and honest. Interwoven with on stage comedy performances is a very personal inside view of her life, as it unfolded, over three years. It shows her genuine heartfelt love and appreciation of her fans, her struggle with clinical depression and the pain of the loss of her mother and husband.",1460160000,9,426,4.930555555555555
7664743,5,B01BP47HLY,"This is as real and raw as I have seen Chonda. I grew up with her and her family. I went to school with her and husband David. For her to open up like this and be so raw was amazing to see. Some things I did not even know. This is a must see for anyone. It was hard to watch but still so compelling. I see her healing daily now. It will not be easy but She will do it! Chonda Ruth, I pray for you and the kids and that healing of family is in the near future!",1460073600,22,459,3.5544554455445545

7664751,5,B01BP47HLY,"I know how hard telling one's story can be.  I have done it.  Opening up one's life to this extent is extremely difficult.  Some of the people who have been critical should have to do it in front of thousands of people.  I am so thankful that Chonda took this step of faith and let us see the ever-present complexities of life.  She is honest about her successes and failures.  Testimonies help us to overcome our own struggles.  We see that we are not alone in struggles--no matter how great.  This documentary touches so many parts of the heart, and it is worth every minute that you spend watching it.",1520467200,3,604,4.427272727272728

7664754,5,B01BP47HLY,"Pain is real! Chonda does not pretend to hide what is real, she shares her pains.  In the midst of everything good or bad, there is Jesus. I have seen her in person and she is truly great!  I was sad to see all that was sacrificed by her and I hope that one day her daughter realizes that her mom has been selfless Christian. I pray she continues to make people laugh even in the darkness. Excellent!",1518048000,,400,4.115384615384615

7664783,5,B01BP47HLY,"Many women (even those who are not famous) experience the same emotional struggles and difficulty in choosing between... or even trying to find balance between family and career. It is a very personal and yet universal experience, and leads to anxiety and depression for many- including me. I appreciate Chonda's willingness to share her story, along with her honesty and trust displayed in doing so. It is encouraging to know, as she said, that we are not alone- and that with God's help, there is always hope! Our faith in the Lord, will see us through it... and laughter is a wonderful, universal coping mechanism provided our amazing God!!",1498262400,,643,4.908256880733945

7664795,4,B01BP47HLY,"I got this video from Focus on the Family with a donation. Please don't get me wrong I so love Chonda! I first discovered her at a Woman of Faith event probably 15 years ago. I have her Four Eyed Blonde dvd and cassette, yes  I said cassette, and I love it ! I used to listen to it and another one I have (can't remember the name) after I'd drop my girls off at school or on other short car trips. I LOVE that she sings some great hymns on Four Eyed Blonde. She really can belt it out for a little southern gal! I had been wondering what she was up to for the last several years but never really checked on the web. Then a little more then a month ago I heard that her movie was coming out and about the loss of her husband. Since I am also a widow of 5 yrs. I totally relate and felt like a kindred spirit with Chonda and what else would a great comedian do but turn tragedy into comedy! I was praying her movie would be back in theaters since I couldn't make it out to see it 2 weeks ago. In the meantime she was on Focus and I wanted to get this dvd. I watched it with my daughter and very honestly it wasn't what I expected. It is clip's from all her other dvd's I think and I guess it's about 90 min. It goes deeply into her life, upbringing, her marriage, her career and the terrible toll it took on her daughter and her marriage. In between are one on one segments where she talks very candidly. It really is all about mental illness, depression, alcoholism etc. My heart broke for her in so many ways. But it was like watching a tragic movie that you want to turn off, but you keep watching because you think it will get better. My daughter and I have fought depression especially after my husband died so I'm not completely unfamiliar with these issues, but for me and my daughter, though I do love Chonda  and again my heart goes out to her and her family (especially her and her daughter and I'm praying for restoration there) but for us this video made us feel depressed. My daughter actually fell asleep half way through and I think that was her way of tuning out her feelings. I'm not hating on Chonda, I'm just letting people know in advance that this may not be for them or you may want to be prepared. I truly feel so badly for what Chonda has gone through and how her ministry/career has taken a huge toll.",1493769600,2,2324,4.094298245614035

7664798,5,B01BP47HLY,"I have caught interviews with Chonda and clips of Chonda's stand up, but I never watched a full video or saw her stand up live. After watching her in another interview, my husband and I decided to stream Laughing in the Dark via streaming because we were both intrigued by an upcoming film that Chonda has coming out that will be nowhere near us. We are not pushovers when it comes to comedy. There is a reason that Chonda is the highest selling comedian ever. She is good.  Really good.  We both were impacted by the laughs and the honesty. Chonda brought us a lot of healthy smiles this afternoon and also some tears. Now to see if my husband might agree to my renting another stand up. :)",1492905600,,691,4.348837209302325

It cuts back-and-forth between many of her different talks.  First they show her saying something in a red dress in one place. . . then saying the same thing in a blue dress in a different place. . . then once again in a different outfit in a different place.  Theres a lot of her talking about how horrible her life has been . .  .  .and it has indeed been bad. .  . .Honestly. .  . .Jesus has done NOTHING for this woman.

This movie takes us to the zenith and nadir of one woman's life.  You are going to like Chondra Pierce so she will capture your attention and take you places that you will not expect to go.  First and foremost this is a funny movie.  No, it is not some come to Jesus sermon  either.  The editing on this film is so superior that it engenders  surprising plot twists and turns.  Pierce is an intelligent, learned, thoughtful person she is worth listening to.  She is kind, compassionate and altruistic which is such a nice light to see when we have the foul smoke stack of Washington politics spewing greed, mendacity and misanthropy over the land.

7664821,5,B01BP47HLY,"I had never heard of this woman before I ran across this video on Amazon.  I was looking for a comedy--stand-up comedy.  I found that and so much more!  A beautiful story--only the mortal part is told here--there is a part that is never ending--a part to be taken up when she is finished with this life and enters the next phase of eternity.  I am deeply moved by this woman's story.  I think her daughter inherited the bi-polar aspect of her mother and granddad--and cannot deal with the ups and downs of that childhood (all childhoods are up and down, by the way).  I think the daughter is coping the best way she knows how.  As is the mother, as is the son--as did their husband and father.  This life was never promised to be easy.  But is was promised to be rich-- rich in experiences--and rich is adversity and rich in blessings.  Nobody gets out of it without all those.  And we take those experiences and their lessons with us forever.  I loved this documentary!  Thank you!",1485907200,4,982,4.418994413407821

7664834,5,B01BP47HLY,"Chonda has certainly had MUCH to overcome in her life.  Praise God she loves the Lord and has forgiven the tragic circumstances that left her feeling empty for so long.  The last chapter of the book informs us that she has the joy of the Lord once more.  I wish, however, that she would have expanded more on how withholding forgiveness and coddling grudges can prevent the personal fellowship with our Savior.  He won't even answer our prayers.  I hated my father for betraying his wife & children with affairs.  I hurt myself horribly.  I had to come to the point where I prayed to the Lord and said, ""Father, I can't forgive in my flesh.  I need your love to enable me and give me grace to forgive him once & for all.""  The Lord certainly answered my prayer and our fellowship on earth and with the Lord was restored.  Most Christians harbor resentments and this causes bitterness and a hard countenance.  Thank you for writing this book, Chonda.  And may you continue that sweet fellowship with the Lord and be even more abundantly blessed!!!!  HUGS",1485216000,2,1053,4.566844919786096

Prime, I couldn't pass up the chance to watch it. I knew she was very funny and I new that she had many losses in her life, but I didn't realize just how dark it must have been for her.  The book, I'm sure, will go into more detail than the movie (that's the way it's usually done) but I wasn't prepared at just how open she'd be about her struggles. I laughed, I smiled, maybe even a chuckle here or there and I cried.  Oh not the tears that just trickle down your cheeks, but big ole monster crocodile tears.  I know Phil. 4:13 says that ""I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me"" but man, How do you bounce back after all she's been through?  The only answer is Jesus!

Thru the years I was aware of some of the struggles faced by these families but Chonda made it REAL.

It certainly was informative on Chonda & her family's life and the sacrifices that were made for Chonda's career, and perhaps really just further validation to thoughts of regrets and ""if only's"" that most people go through later in life when they look back at the choices they make to sacrifice family time in hopes for a better life.  It also was proof to me that whether Christian, atheist, buddhist or some other religion we all live behind masks that would better serve us if we could remove them and just be real and transparent.",1464652800,3,611,4.587155963302752

Her own family triumphs and mistakes. She shares about her battle with depression, husband's alcohol abuse, and daughter not letting her be in her life. Then about losing her mom and husband and how she still keeps going and still has faith. Her honestly sharing about the real Christian Life in her concerts.
