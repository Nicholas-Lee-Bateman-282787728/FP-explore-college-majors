6901407,5,B00R6PE008,Love this video! Sean Corn talks about the true meaning of yoga,1426377600,,63,4.333333333333333
6901408,5,B00R6PE008,"As usual, Seane Corn has created an amazing practice that not only addresses the physical body but also the connection to spirit and the world around us as well as the individual Chakras. I love Seane Corn! This DVD set is an excellent addition to Seane's Yoga of Awakening. Recommended!!",1425513600,10,288,4.78
6901409,5,B00R6PE008,I LOVE this series! It is my favorite if all my yoga DVDs (and I have many). HIGHLY recommend it!,1425254400,6,97,3.9
6901410,5,B00R6PE008,"I love it!  Unfortunately, the dvd had some tracking problems, but I must say that Amazon handled the return fabulously and I should get my new copy in a day or so!  This practice (3 dvd's) is so well done and put together.  There is so much great information about the Chakras and Seane Corn's explanations and words are wonderful.  The yoga sessions are awesome so far, I've done through the 4th chakra - it gives you the theoretical  - lots of info then you can do the experiential practice with less talking - I guess, I haven't got that far.  There is also a 90 minute session which I haven't done yet but if it's an aggregate of the shorter sessions (which seem to run around 40 minutes or so) I can't wait to do it, I'm sure it will be amazing.  The first dvd is all talking about the chakras and her personal story which is so strange but beautiful of her journey to where she is today.  She is truly amazing and this is such a great value and something that I will probably use for years to come and also share information as a yoga teacher with my students.",1424736000,10,1067,4.221674876847291
6901411,5,B00R6PE008,"I've only had Chakra Flow for a short time, but I think it's fantastic. In terms of the yoga video world, this is groundbreaking. I also have Detox Flow and Mind Body Flow. Seane has found a very important niche (for lack of a better word) within this world. Her approach to teaching yoga is beneficial for all of us, particularly those recovering from the challenge of life, trauma, bad memories, disfunctional lives and relationships, addictions -- you name it. If you are human and struggle with life (and we all do in one way or another), Chakra Flow can help you live with more compassion, both for yourself and others, forgive, accept, find more joy and relax into the mystery that is life.

There are three discs. Disc one has detailed information about the chakras, how Chakra Flow can help you, instructions on how to use the dvd set and Seane's personal story. Disc two has 7 individual practices, specifically for each chakra, each with two audio tracks to help guide you physically, mentally and emotionally. As always, her cues are detailed and easy to follow without much looking at the screen. Disc three contains a 90 minute practice that brings the whole thing together. The music is beautiful, inspiring, comforting and gentle. Some of the best and most appropriate music I've heard on a yoga dvd and not distracting in any way. The set is serene with excellent lighting. Overall, this set is very well-prepared and harmonious.

Even if you're new to yoga, I would suggest giving this a try (especially if you're desperately searching for healing and haven't found the answer). Just take it slow and be patient with yourself. You can always modify. Dont pressure yourself to be perfect. You will improve the more you practice, just like anything else. Even though Seane doesn't delve very much into how to modify every pose, I think most people instinctively know how to modify anything physical. If you like to learn, even when you're not so great at something in the beginning, need healing in your life (again, who doesn't?), or have been practicing what I call ""empty yoga"" and haven't felt the emotional benefits, Seane can help you improve yourself, not just physically, but help you become better inside as well.

I like how Seane speaks to everyone, no matter what your faith, as well as atheists. I don't recall that she addresses atheists specifically, but she came from a place of unbelief in her younger years and I don't feel that she puts this down in any way, but is speaking to everyone at the place you happen to be. I'm Christ-based in my beliefs and I personally speak to Christ as I begin each practice and I thank Him for leading me to yoga, once again in my life.

I mainly wrote this for those of you who've been struggling to keep your head above water emotionally and finding no comfort or help, this could be the answer for you. My only advice is to really listen to everything Seane talks about. Watch all the discs prior to following along, especially disc one. Take your time and then watch closely your inner voice and your feelings, relationships, etc. on and off the mat. You may notice subtle changes or profound ones, but I believe you will notice positive things as a result.

I would say difficulty level is somewhere between beginner and intermediate, but I've been practicing yoga for quite a while, so my opinion may not be accurate for everyone. There is a 90 minute practice, but again, if you're new to yoga and don't feel you can do it, simply wait until you're ready.

Ordering from Amazon, you can always return if it's not for you.

This is a wonderful set for you if you're looking for deeper meaning in your practice, aren't hung up thinking you have to always be doing the most complicated yoga poses, and looking to go deeper than just the physically beautifying effects of yoga.

This would be a wonderful gift for someone recovering from addiction, struggling with anxiety or depression, suffering from grief, abuse, post war trauma and those you may know who are always trying to better themselves.

I'm thrilled to finally own this. I've been waiting for months for the release of this video and years to release pent-up pain. I'm looking forward to more positive changes.

Thank you, Seane! Most wonderful yoga video I own. God bless you!",1424476800,82,4311,4.705570291777188
6901412,5,B00R6PE008,Amazing! So much information in this 3 dvd set. You can feel the love Seane put into this project! Highly recommend.,1423008000,4,116,4.571428571428571
6901413,5,B00R6PE008,"I don't review often, but I love this DVD set.
I can see the perspectives of all the reviews so far.
If you are a beginner, Seane Corn can be a challenge. I love that she encourages using a block or strap, or using modifications to suit your current level of expertise. Keep going! You will notice that you master more and more each time you do it.
If you are just looking at yoga as exercise, this set will not be for you. While it does offer challenges, for the athlete there will be too much talking and not enough action. Each chakra is around 35-45 minutes long, although the last DVD is 90 minutes. If all you want is exercise and no prayer, meditation, or introspection, perhaps Vinyasa Flow is a better choice for you.
If you are looking for information on yoga, or if your practice is more about moving deeply inside through yoga, this is the best option!
Yes, it is repetitive, but most vinyasa yoga classes are. I was told by a friend from India that it is optimal to do Chaturanga Dandasana a dozen times in one session. If you were to do a search on Chaturanga Dandasana you would see that it's done to infinity and beyond in most classes. Thus there are many tutorials on how to do it correctly.
I did Seane Corn Vinyasa Flow for a couple of years and enjoyed it as exercise. Then gained a bunch of weight due to illness and injuries. I couldn't safely jump back in where I left off. I got this thinking it would be a nice change. Now it's my favorite!
I love the spiritual focus and that it provides an opportunity to explore healing in a new way. As a HypnoBirthing instructor, I enjoy the visualization and information on the mind/body connection.
I look forward to being able to get the others in the series at some point, hopefully soon.

6901414,3,B00R6PE008,This is not for me. The practices are too repetitive and hard on my shoulders. Haven't gone through all of it yet.,1464048000,,114,4.2272727272727275
6901415,5,B00R6PE008,i like this dvd. it is very informative. i don't know anything about yoga so it's a little advanced for me.,1463184000,,107,4.142857142857143
6901416,5,B00R6PE008,GREAT,1459814400,,5,5.0
6901417,5,B00R6PE008,"Very insightful and deep - and I mean that. Be prepared to go inside and really look at yourself. I like this, but I do not do it as much as other yoga as it is so deep. But worth it. A great DVD to help if you have issues.",1456790400,2,223,3.48
6901418,5,B00R6PE008,Love this!  Great info and love Sean Corn!,1456358400,,42,4.25
6901419,5,B00R6PE008,"This is the best yoga dvd I've ever seen.  I am a yoga teacher, and practice everyday, and I love this.  Seane provides beautiful options with seven practices, one for each chakra, that are around 45-minutes in length, which are great for a shorter complete practice.  Her words are beautiful and wise, and I like how she gives you the option for a theoretical practice or experiential.  The 90-minute practice on the third dvd is masterfully arranged, and will open your heart, body, mind, and soul.  Thank you Seane!",1455580800,4,518,4.775280898876405
6901420,5,B00R6PE008,"Love this dvd....very informational.  Seane Corn is such a spiritual, accepting person.  Her dvd is wonderful and full of chakra information!",1454025600,,141,5.666666666666667
6901421,5,B00R6PE008,Amazing practice. I enjoy this one very much. I have all of her dvds and this is definately my favorite of hers. My only complaint is that I like doing the whole flow because it truely is a complete practice with the best of everything but it very long...90 mins and its not easy to put aside that amount of time with young kids.,1451692800,2,329,4.15625
6901422,5,B00R6PE008,Wife LOVES Seane Corn!!!!,1451606400,,25,5.5
6901423,5,B00R6PE008,"Seane has a way of speaking to my soul.  This set has 3 DVDs.  The first one is a lengthy interview with her where she explains her background and her yoga.  It gave me way more insight to both where she is coming from and what it can do for me.  The second DVD has a full session for each chakra, broken into a choice of Experiential or Theoretical descriptions.  The third DVD incorporates all the chakras into a yoga session.",1447545600,16,428,4.234567901234568
6901424,5,B00R6PE008,"I've had this DVD for less than 24 hours and have gone through two chakras.  It is amazing.  I've done yoga for years, and love it for it's ability to bring the brain/body connection to me.  These practices, however, have actually made me bust out in tears, both times, and helped me realize that I have so much healing to do, emotionally.  It's a beautiful experience and I can't wait to work on more.  I love Sean Corn for her unpretentious teaching style (I also own Detox Flow-one of my favorites!) and was not disappointed in these DVDs.  I would recommend it to everyone for it's ability to help us to start healing ourselves.",1443744000,9,632,4.5
6901425,5,B00R6PE008,By far best yoga teacher and inspirational yoga ever. The inner healing piece and lessons on the DVDs are beautiful and invaluable. I bought one for a fiend who is grieving and shared with my mom...love it!!,1441843200,,207,4.621621621621622

Thankjou !!!",1433289600,,82,4.857142857142857
6901430,4,B00R6PE008,"Really beautiful collection.  7 shorter practices (most are about 40 minutes), each addressing a different chakra, plus a long form practice incorporating all the chakras.  Another great collection by Seane Corn.  If you are a fan of her style of teaching, you won't be disappointed here.",1430524800,12,288,5.217391304347826
6901431,5,B00R6PE008,Another Seane Corn gem. I love this teacher. I treasure whatever she brings forth and this is no exception. She is authentic and unpretentious and gives beautiful practice options here for anybody exploring their practice as it integrates into the chakras. Highly recommend!,1428537600,3,274,5.395348837209302
8694313,5,B00R6PE008,My husband and I both are working through these practices.  They are masterfully put together and Seane Corn beautifully guides the practitioner.  I highly recommend using the program exactly as she suggests.  Don't rush ahead.  It will be worth it in the long run!,1532908800,,265,4.954545454545454
8694314,5,B00R6PE008,"Ive done yoga videos for years and taken many classes, this is definitely the best video I have ever done. It is challenging, and intense, but at a very doable level that allows room for growth. She also teaches about chakras and provides instruction on Buddhist practice that was very nice and definitely made the lesson more meaningful and special than other dvds Ive used (and classes!). I really enjoy this dvd, definitely recommend.",1529020800,,437,4.918918918918919

8694316,5,B00R6PE008,Love the DVD. I love her poses and how she articulated the explanation of the chakra system. This dvd inspired me to order the other in the series .,1512864000,,148,4.137931034482759

8694321,5,B00R6PE008,"I've purchased several yoga DVDs in search of one that would be a good fit and it's not been easy. They seem to be too easy, too difficult, not interesting, etc . . .  Very pleased with Seane Corn's style.  These Chakara work outs are perfect length for me (about 40 min) and include a longer challenging routine as well.  Each routine makes you feel energized and connected - and feels like a real yoga class work out.  Highly recommend!",1469318400,4,438,4.4375
8694322,5,B00R6PE008,"Excellent, mindful yoga practice. If you are looking for a yoga workout that you can do in the mornings before work, this is the one. The first 5 Chakra's are great for Mon-Fri and you can find your edge at 5am. The sixth and 7th are slower and are great for the weekend (I rolled them into one). I found her speak inspiring & guiding - to the point where I reflected upon it during the day. I have yet to do the 95 min (all chakra) practice because, unless I'm doing a half marathon with a medal at the end, that's a long time and I have stuff to do.",1468886400,,551,3.972972972972973
