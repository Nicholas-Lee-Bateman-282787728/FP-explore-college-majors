1976428,4,B00018D3RS,"Red Skelton was standard viewing when I was a kid.  I enjoyed him immensely.  This is good to have to remember those days.  It is not the best shows represented, but is of high quality and worth the expense.",1356480000,3,207,4.256410256410256
1976429,2,B00018D3RS,"It was difficult to tell as the dvd's were not secure, or were jostled somehow, out of the disc holder in package.  The discs were shaking in unopened package.  There were some scratches from the discs moving against one another and many scenes were difficult to see or hear.

I think this might have been a good collection, but too difficult to watch.

Sorry.",1355961600,4,360,4.578125
1976430,1,B00018D3RS,I found this dvd very hard to understand.  The voice quality is not good at all.  This is full skits of his shows years ago.  I like it when they show small bits and pieces of funny skits but this was the whole skit and they weren't that funny.,1352937600,2,244,3.938775510204082

1976435,5,B00018D3RS,"Loved the DVD. I always loved Red Skelton as I was growing up and forgot how much he made me laugh. It was so refreshing to watch a comedian who did not rely on 4-letter words. This is a great DVD for anyone who grew up during the 1950s to 1960s when comedy was ""clean""",1313452800,25,269,3.909090909090909
1976436,5,B00018D3RS,"The best comedian ever.

1976439,1,B00018D3RS,"This is not worth your money.  I ordered this for my father as he is a big Red Skelton fan.  I thought it would have skits of the old shows with the focus on the skits that ""Red"" was in.  It is 5 DVDs of the Red Skelton Shows, and you have to watch the whole show, and there was very little skits of Red Skelton in it.  I was very disappointed in this, and so was my father.",1183593600,6,374,3.6962025316455698
1976440,5,B00018D3RS,The tape wasn't exactly what I was looking for my mother wanted the Red Skelton doing the pledge of allegiance and this was not on there.
