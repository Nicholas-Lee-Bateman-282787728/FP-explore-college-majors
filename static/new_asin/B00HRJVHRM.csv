8634873,1,B00HRJVHRM,The snippets were too short often with no conclusions to the events.,1421020800,,68,4.75
8634874,1,B00HRJVHRM,The first disc is about  Sherlock Holmes. They can't even burn the right DVD for the set. The second disc has boring superficial clips. The booklet inside the set fell apart when I opened up the package. Don't buy this. It's is a cheap knockoff.  Deceptive advertising and a total waste of money. Amazon should not carry this item.,1417046400,,331,4.593220338983051
8634875,1,B00HRJVHRM,"If 0 stars was an option, I would go with that!!  I bought this as a gift and so I missed the return date.  The first DVD was and old episode of ""Sherlock Holmes"".
Here is the description of this item; ""Witness some of the worlds most significant events through the eyes of someone who was there, in person, and lived to tell the story.""  But that is NOT what it is.  It is little clips of information that was probably found on the internet and presented very poorly on this DVD.

DO NOT PURCHASE!!",1413504000,,499,4.2105263157894735
