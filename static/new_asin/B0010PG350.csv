I guess the main problem is that it's basically a choreographed dance, by people who look like they've never danced before.  Is that ""art""?  Pretending you have talent when you don't?  You can tell the level of pretension by the fact that the director's name is part of the title, when she is (and no doubt will always be) a complete nobody.  Not much plot, drama, beauty or anything else good -- just some people young enough, conceited enough, and self-indulgent enough to think anyone else might possibly want to watch this garbage.  Not worth the money.",1239753600,2,612,4.568807339449541
