8323872,4,B0001P1B9I,"The warning at the back of the DVD declared that there may be variance in picture and sound quality, previous reviews here stated that the production values were obviously low so I was pleasantly surprised to watch two excellent programs without any noticeable loss in picture or sound and production values as high as we'd expect from the BBC in the late '60's. Peter Cushing is superb as Sherlock Holmes, witty, urbane and not afraid to get his trouser knees muddy in his quest for clues. This portrayal is much closer to Doyle's Holmes than his brusque performance in Hammer's 1959 ""Hound Of The Baskervilles"". Nigel Stock's Watson is solid and sensible with just a hint of the awestruck gaper necessary to accentuate Holmes's brilliance. ""A Study In Scarlet"" is dramatised by Hugh Leonard, no less, leaving out most of the expositional Utah back-story to move the episode along at a tight pace. Having never seen a live action version of this story before it was a real treat to finally see Holmes tackle the first case Doyle wrote for him. ""The Boscombe Valley Mystery"" is also well done; faithful to Doyle's story and plenty of exterior location shots make it feel less studio-bound. The crudely animated sequence used to illustrate Jack Black's Australian past works for me but I can see how it may not satisfy audiences used to more sophisticated methods. I'm thoroughly satisfied that I came across this gem, I heartily recommend it to all fans of Sherlock Holmes and I'll be to sure to acquire the other 2 DVDs to complete the set.",1156377600,,1541,4.775280898876405
8323873,3,B0001P1B9I,"I just viewed the 3 disc set from the BBC containing this disc of classic Sherlock Holmes stories and was generally surprised by the quality of the video and the performances (my expectations were low for a series this old). Having seen Cushing previously only in Dracula and Frankenstein-type horror roles (people today probably know him best from his role in Star Wars), I liked his restrained but authentic portrayal of Holmes in this series. Less quirky and exhuberant than Jeremy Brett's benchmark performances, he conveyed the idiosyncratic detective's character well. These films were made 30 years prior to the BBC series starring Brett, on a very apparent low budget, and the interiors are what we have seen in the past from TV series from the BBC at this time period - a bit stagey, theatrical and just slightly unrealistic, although there is some nice exterior work for some scenes. What was really surprising was the generally good quality of the video source and digital transfer - sharp images with bright vibrant colors that looked like a modern filming of the older BBC play of the week on tape style (there are scenes with motion-artifacts typical of poor digital transfers, particularly in scenes with jerky movement like carriage or train scenes, and in darker segments). There is only one other film version of the Study in Scarlet I am aware of (much older), so this was an enjoyable 50 minutes. The story is fairly close to Doyle's work, although all the Utah story is missing and the Mormon connection is absent, probably due to time constraints more than anything else. The Boscombe Valley Mystery is reasonably well done with many authentic parts, although I did not care for the lack of filmed sequences in Australia substituted with still drawings, and the death of Black Jack was over the top. One caveat - I own the PAL discs of this series - often the NTSC versions of PAL films are significantly poorer quality wise - any real J. Brett fan knows what poor NTSC DVDs Granada released and obtained the much brighter, sharper, artifact-free PAL versions of his Holmes. Recommended for Holmes fans, an interesting comparison to the Brett versions, and entertaining.",1146268800,2,2192,4.9110512129380055
