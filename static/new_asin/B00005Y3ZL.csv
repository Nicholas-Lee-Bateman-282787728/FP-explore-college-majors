1674490,5,B00005Y3ZL,"Mr Show with Bob and David is easily one of the greatest comedy
shows of all time!  I don't mean that lightly.  I hold Monty Python's Flying Circus, SNL (when it was funny), and the Kids in the Hall with the highest reguard, but Mr Show may be the funniest of the lot.  How is it that these guys aren't household names?  HBO foolishly put them on at 12:00 am Mondaynights with little promotional support.  Sadly, I think the bigger problem lies in the fact that many people don't like their comedy (or entertainment in general) to challange them.  Mr Show does just that.  It's comedy thats edgy and surreal while remaining extraordinarily relevant.  A must own!  Absolutely hillarious!!",1013644800,4,687,4.705882352941177
1674491,4,B00005Y3ZL,"The only reason I wouldn't give this disc a full 5 stars is that the first season showed Bob and David finding their way and the writing is just not as consistent, though the sketch involving the flag and why performance artists can't crap on it is amazing.
The second season -- unbelievable -- may be the best of the bunch -- the Cross/Odenkirk facility for multi-layered sketches that manage to not just pick one easy target, but combine targets to make points.  As silly as they could get, Bob and David definitely had a viewpoint about American life.  Mr. Show was never a litany of one-joke characters like Saturday Night Live.
And look out for the Jeepers Creepers skit (a slacker version of Jesus Christ Superstar) with a bravado performance by occasional cast member Jack Black.",1012608000,8,786,4.7299270072992705

1674493,5,B00005Y3ZL,"Everyone loves sketch comedy, be it Kids in the Hall, Benny Hill, or Monty Python.  But wait, where's our contribution?  America?  Hello?  HBO provided one, ever so briefly to us that became a bit of a phenomenon.  Mr. Show with Bob and David.  It's a bit hard to describe, there's no recurring characters, and it's offensive as all get out.  But it's all good.  Mr. Show is the sketch comedy show that leaves flaming bags of human feces on doorsteps of other sketch comedy shows, not satisfied with dog poo. HBO's allowance of crude language and material allowed Bob, David, and co. free reign to be as offensive as any of their standup acts, and not have to apologise for any of it.  See sketches such as the Satanist religion network, Show us your Weenis, or The New San Francisco. After watching this set, you'll find yourself surprised on two counts, that some of these guys were allowed to work again, and that most of them you watch on TV on 2 to 3 shows a week.  What's also surprising is that even though the show has been out of production for 3 years it's still referenced often when one of the cast members wants to do a personal appearance.  Highly recommended, if only for a glimpse into what kind of damage American sketch comedy can do against the big boys of Britain.",1011484800,10,1284,4.467811158798283
1674494,5,B00005Y3ZL,"Mr. Show was by far the funniest show of the 1990's, and the funniest sketch show I have ever seen. It can be described as somewhat of a modern-day Monty Python's Flying Circus, in that sketches led into each other. What makes this series destined to become classic is that Bob and David avoided doing topical humor, and it wasn't often they did parody, and when they DID parody something, it was written so that you didn't really have to get the parody for it to be funny.
An excellent excellent comedy series. I can not think of one skit they did that I would call bad.",1011312000,8,571,4.345794392523365

1674496,5,B00005Y3ZL,"This TV series is phenomenal.  The characters and situations that Bob and David come up with are completely crazy in a totally realistic way, and are completely believable and generally hilarious. As someone who loves sketch comedy, they are among my favorite groups.  Up there with UCB and Monty Python in my book.  Mr. Show also makes you think to make the connections.  If you like sketch comedy, you will love this tv show.",1330905600,,427,4.72972972972973

1674498,5,B00005Y3ZL,"A friend told me I should check this out, so I did.  It's really good!  Bob and David move seamlessly between live (in front of an audience) and taped segments.  I knew this model would work well when in the first episode they were on stage and talking to different versions of themselves in the audience.  Definitely a unique model of television.  Highly recommended if you like sketch comedy and mild ridiculousness.",1207526400,,418,4.75
1674499,4,B00005Y3ZL,"Not laugh out loud in many places, but brilliant with regards to what I would call ""cerebral"" humour.  Very interesting and provocative.  Plus, you get to see early footage of the dawning careers of Jack Black, Jeanine Garofalo, and of course, David Cross & Bob Odenkirk.  Was hoping to see some of David's stand up stuff in video form but was happy to see the infamous Ronnie Dobbs' entrance into comedy reality.",1199232000,,413,4.708333333333333
1674500,5,B00005Y3ZL,"What is it about the Canadians? They just seem to have a knack for droll, subversive humor, which is my favorite kind. ""Mr. Show"" is tied with ""The Kids in the Hall"" (another Canadian brainchild) for my favorite sketch comedy show of all time.

""Stream of consciousness"" is the phrase that comes up often when people are talking about the show, and it's understandable. The skits don't ever really end, they just flow into one another, like some kind of comedic dream. The show is so non-linear and unpredictable that you're constantly amazed, confused and shocked by the places it's willing to go. But to just write it all off as obtuse would be a mistake, because underneath all the insanity are plenty of subversive and right-on political messages. One of my favorites is the advertisements for various ""Globo-Chem"" products, a giant corporation whose commercials go out of their way to insult and offend you, and then proclaim, with their tagline, ""Take it from me ... I love you!""",1195516800,,985,4.828402366863905

1674502,4,B00005Y3ZL,"The first two seasons are without a doubt, gut-bustingly hilarious. But now that you can get the whole collection, it's redundant to buy the seasons one at a time. You will most likely save money if you get the whole collection. The whole collection can go for $50 and in some cases as low as $40! That sure beats paying $20 to $30 per season. Especially since you will become addicted after seeing it once.",1171497600,,407,4.44
1674503,4,B00005Y3ZL,"The reason this show works is because the ensemble cast (which is probably five or six actors alongside Bob and David) is absolutely brilliant. Each of them. The writing, really, isn't that great, but where it compensates for this is in execution -- acting, directing, etc. Like 'Saturday Night Live', most of the sketches are performed on a set live in front of an audience, but they also take the opportunity to make more cinematic comedy and utilize editing and timing to heightened effect in pre-recorded scenes. Personally, I prefer this tact. My personal favorite sketch comedy is the relatively short ran 'Upright Citizens Brigade', which aired on Comedy Central in the late 90's. That show, more than any I've seen, truly took advantage of all the benefits sketch outside a live arena has to offer, and when 'Mr. Show' walks this road, the two shows are very similar indeed.

Personally, I still don't find this show to be outright hilarious -- at least not in great doses  --but I do find it to be utterly compelling. Again, it's the talent amongst the crew -- they're all great performers. I find Bob Odenkirk to be one of the funniest, most entertaining men alive, and while I'm not as fond of David Cross, it's pretty hard to deny how unbelievably gifted the guy is... He's dynamic and crass, real and able to unload without shame. The chemistry between the two (friends) is obvious and a joy to watch, and this extends to the rest of the crew. You really get the idea that most the primary people working on the show were good friends, and this makes the show far more endearing when it's all said and done.

Again, as far as writing, and general ideas, 'Mr. Show' is often frustratingly inconsistent, but part of this is due to the fact that it's so ambitious in concept and what it aims for. It's the people involved that make it shine, regardless of what material is being worked with.",1170979200,,1901,4.635014836795253
1674504,2,B00005Y3ZL,"I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the ""burger"" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry...",1148860800,6,793,4.880597014925373
1674505,5,B00005Y3ZL,"I've been a Mr Show fan for decades. I saw Bob and David (not Dave) in concert in Twin Falls, Idaho back in 1989. They were a bit raw, but what they lacked in polish they made up for in sincerity and harmony. Some people want to call them the next Bob & Ray or Rowan & Martin or even Goldberg/Williams/Crystal. I say peeshaw! Bob has more talent in his ankle (left) than all of those jerks combined. And for David (not Dave), he's an example of how to live your life even when your body is being ravaged by HPV.

1674507,5,B00005Y3ZL,"This is the fourth time I have watched this first and second season of Mr. Show, and I must admit, it is one of those rare programs that continues to get funnier and funnier each time that you watch it.  Literally, you catch something new and fresh each time it is placed inside of your DVD player.  What makes this series work better than most other television comedies out there is the chemistry of the cast.  Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are perfectly matched while also being completely random choices for the hosts of the show.  I had not heard about either of them before watching this series (which I bought due to a recommendation from a friend), now I have watched Melvin Goes to Dinner several times and listened to David Cross' stand-up comedy whenever I need a very social pick-me-up!  Needless to say, I have full submersed myself into their world after watching this groundbreaking series.

What continues to work with this program is that the jokes are not your typical slapstick humor that the average ""Joe"" can get from watching reruns of Friends on NBC.  Mr. Show is hard hitting, in your face, political, yet not so political, social satire about the world around us.  While you may just see this as just another comedy show, I see it as so much more.  The cohesiveness of the skits and the underlying message throughout each show seem to represent the voices that we hear coming from our local papers on a daily basis.  They are not afraid to take a delicate issue and twist it into a hysterical moment.  The brutal honesty of David Cross makes this show thoroughly enjoyable while the approachable Bob Odenkirk brings it to our level.  Also, the interweaving of comic geniuses throughout the show keeps you wanting more.  Jack Black is a regular on the program (and really proves why he is funny), and there are appearances by Dave Foley, Sarah Silverman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Patton Oswalt, Julia Sweeney, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Stiller, Conan O'Brien, and Andy Richter.  This is not a show for everyone, but it does showcase the beauty of HBO and the ability that they have to see, and go forward, with avant-garde comedy.

My favorite episodes were the News Report featured in the extras, Operation Hell on Earth, and If You're Going to Write a Comedy Scene, You're Going to Have Some Rat Feces in There, and the infamous milk machine joke song with Jack Black!  Utterly hysterical. (no pun intended)

This DVD set of the first and second seasons is packaged very well.  With every season uncensored (were they ever with HBO), you get Mr. Show as it should be and will always be remembered.  It also is chalked full of extras that will quench every drop of Mr. Show that resides in you.  The news report that they do in the extras portion of this DVD is worth buying alone.  Again, it shows the creativity and originality of a program that knew no boundaries.  I cannot wait to get my hands on the other seasons and fully explore the world in which I live ... which is the world showcased continually on Mr. Show.  The absurdity of our culture is redefined with this program.

It was on of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.  These men are geniuses, although not everybody gets their brand of comedy.

1674510,5,B00005Y3ZL,"I had been aware that once there was a show called ""Mr. Show"", starring Bob and David, and that it had been on HBO. But I had never been compelled to buy any of their DVDs until this weekend, when the power of Satan...um, compelled me to pick up the first two seasons. All I gotta say is: Praise Satan for leading me to this glory!

The first season, comprised of four episodes, is fantastic, with flashes of brilliance on ""The Gay Porno Video"", but it's the second season that really will make you a fan. Such oddities as F.F. Woodycooks, Only The British Can Fly, Child-Labor Comedy Writers, the Iguana, and Jeepers Creepers: Semi-Star unleash the funny like you'd never believe.

Mr. Show proves that there is a market for intelligent, hilarious sketch comedy...on cable, or in the case of KITH and Monty Python, imported from other countries. But Mr. Show is homegrown, it's comedy at a breakneck speed, and there's never a dull moment in either season. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll learn how to fight crime with a ""crime stick"" and ice cream, and enjoy tofu-based products while your business goes to hell...led by a red balloon.

laughter leading to hilarity.
Should I say it? God, it's passe. A'right.
Okay, they're ""Non P.C."" That's such a lame description that a sketch on the show can be based on that alone.
Both Bob and David play the straight guy (as in Costello, of Abbott and.., not, ya know, like..ha, ha..gay..ha, ha), the crazy, wacky psycho and/or sociopath, the normal fellow that's so normal he appears psycho and/or socio, etc., etc.
They've got a great, great ensemble cast (damn, how do you make an accent mark?).
Okay; example of Mr. Show humor. Man and woman with baby. Both dressed in 1920's flapper look. Husband (David) with handlebar mustache and kinda the ole ice cream man kinda suit and the woman looking like Great Gatsby material. They're arguing...
Man: Hey, honey, take 'er easy (can't remember exactly, but uses a lot of period lingo).
Woman: Suck my d-ck!! (then she throws the baby on the ground).
If that's funny, this is YOUR SHOW! It's my show.
Why, it's Mr. SHOW!!
Oh, by the way; being a former Chicagoan, I can attest the accuracy of Bob's Chicago-ese accent in appropriate sketches.
Thanks guys. Keep up the, well, whatever? Thanks, really!",1085443200,2,1275,4.747747747747748

It's a fact, many people don't find Mr. Show funny.
I know, it is infruating, often embarrasing, but somehow true.  Quite often I've treated ""the unexposed"" to this comic gem only to receive minor guffaws and uncomfortable bouts of silence.
So, to those that have not seen Mr. Show, if you find series' like Curb Your Enthusiasm, or (Britain's) The Office funny, you'll very likely love Mr. Show.
To that class of people who've seen Mr. Show and enjoyed their dark, often nearly imperceptibly subtle humor, you'll love this DVD.  It is among the few in my collection that I frequently play.

1674513,3,B00005Y3ZL,"This is a very Monty Python inspired style of sketch comedy where the sketches and monologues all sort of bleed together in one way or another. Sometimes the show will take the watcher from monologue, to skit, to a commercial parody, to song and dance, and then back to a monologue or some other weird avenue. I have to say that I like their fresh approach to comedy but I'll also have to add that their brand of comedy doesn't always work for me and I thought at some points the supporting talent outside of Bob and David were a little weak at points. On this particular dvd set I really enjoyed the musical, the music video, the mom and pop porn shop, and the episode where David tries to pee on the flag. I also thought the best thing on the dvd was in the extras and it was some weird episode about drugs. Really good stuff.

Ok, so maybe i forgot some of the other points, but i'll make this point crystal clear!
Mr. Show is BEST WHEN WATCHING season one!  There are so many points they make that i just bole over; GIDDY with the GIGGLES!
For instance. When they bring out that guy with the ponytail and the toffutti, he's like my uncle.  he says ""WORK IS PLAY!"" and i really agree with that point, but the WAY they portray that CHARACTER is so true to life, i just get the FITS! ITS SO TRUE that people are FUNNY LIKE THAT GUY!
another sene i like is whene they have ronnie dobbs run around the streets like COPS! and they pretend he has some weired DISEASE, but they don't go into depth, otherwise the viewer (you, me, the world) would begin to care for him, and he's really NOT one of the GOOD GUYS! he's a CRIMINAL! so i like the way they Portrayed that CAHRECTER! um let me see what else is REALLY GOOD ON SEASON ONE AND TWO of these dvds. THREE TIMES ONE IS FREAKING HILARIOUS!!! if you've ever seen mtv, you'll GET IT! STRAIGHT AWAY! they boy they hit the head STRAIGHT ON with that One! they show that mtv ISNT all it's cracked up to Be! and we ALL learn something. um also .. i don't know the point IM making (crystal clear, remember) is that there's a whole MYRIAD OF FUNNY STUFF ON THIS two dvdS!!

Bob plays the ""Straight Man"" and David the ""Wacky Guy"", or so it seems at first.

They get help from somewhat familiar faces like, Sarah Silverman, Janeanne Garofalo, and Paul F. Tompkins (who can be seen weekly on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher).

1674528,5,B00005Y3ZL,"First off, I never saw the show when it originally aired. Friday night at midnight in the mid-90's???? I was never even home then. I have a social life. Who's home at 12 on a Friday? I knew of it, and had seen a clip or two, but never an entire episode. I learned of them through Jack Black of Tenacious D, who is in a few of these episodes. All I can say is GET IT. The level of comedy darkness here is amazing. So many sweet lines fly by that you begin to miss them. You have to watch again to catch all the nuances. Plus, there's optional commentary for each episode, which amounts to an improv overdub as well. If you like this, you should also get the David Cross cd on SubPop records, too. So much better than any other sketch show out there. If you laugh at sarcasm and mockery and Jesus and morons, this is the view for you. I loved it.

1674532,5,B00005Y3ZL,"I accidently came accross Mr. Show in its 3d season on HBO during an insomniatic traverse over the entire cable TV dial.  Two minutes into the ""Titanica"" sketch I was hooked and did whatever I could to catch every episode from that point on.  I say a little prayer every day that HBO releases seasons 3 and 4 soon.
Everything you've heard about this show is true.  People describe it as part Monty Python, part SCTV, part Kids in the Hall and that's all accurate to a point, but there really is no way to truly describe this show to anyone who has not seen it.  This is one of the funniest TV shows I have ever seen - - you just have to watch it for yourself to find out why.
Warning . . . if you think Carrot Top is funny and think Jay Leno is cutting edge humor you will NOT like this.  This is offbeat, sometimes in your face, sometimes dark, occassionally VERY dark, often weird comedy.  If you're easily offended by ""blue"" language (i.e. the ""f"" word and its cousins) this might not be your cup of tea.  On the other hand, if you're bored out of your mind by most of what passes for comedy on TV this is the tonic you've been waiting for.  It can be intelligent and incredibly silly at the same time.  Again, it's really hard to explain - - just watch the f'in' show okay.
Bob Odenkirk worked for years as a comedy writer for Saturday Night Live (where Lorne Michaels rarely aired his sketches - - too edgy), Conan O'Brien (they met at SNL) and was a main stage cast member at Second City (he originated Chris Farley's popular ""Motivational Speaker"" character at Second City before SNL overkilled it).  David Cross was a standup comic and writer in Boston for years before becoming part of the alternative comedy scene in L.A.  Cross and Odenkirk met as writers on Ben Stiller's short lived show and began working together as a team before HBO started to notice their act.
The show has a fiercely devoted cult following.  The show's cast and writers attribute the show's critical success and cult audience devotion to the fact that HBO pretty much left them alone and let them do whatever they wanted.
These are very funny people working in a very unrestrained environment and they produced something extremely funny in the process.  If you ""get it"" you'll wet your pants laughing.",1043280000,38,2286,4.453237410071942

In my opinion the funniest part of the show are the musical segments (Three times one minus one, Jeepers Creepers- the biggist failure in broadway history, The Joke - The Musical, etc) but most of the sketches are pretty damn funny anyway. I won't bother describing them to you because it will just end up sounding stupid.

1674534,5,B00005Y3ZL,"I don't know, from their audio commentary, whether these guys recognize how obvious their primary influences are.  One is Monty Python's Flying Circus, a show that aimed for non-linear sketch comedy, continuous flow at the expense of traditional structure (sometimes even dispensing with punchlines), brilliance, relevance, surrealism, and which didn't ""play down"" to the audience but instead aimed for a high degree of intellectualism.  Kids in the Hall, who were influenced by Python, retained most of those characteristics but updated the genre, moving towards small dramatic scenes while dealing with issues like the modern family unit, big business, working for a big business, and teenage angst.
Mr. Show plays exactly like those two shows did.  It is occasionally bizarre and effete in a way that will turn viewers off.  But it is frequently brilliant, so brilliant, incisive, and funny that it can make you cry.  Among the topics explored and satirized well are political correctness, homophobia, global capitalism, and vapidity on television.
David Cross, especially, is a great performer, and Bob Odenkirk certainly has his moments.  If you're interested in ambitious comedy, you'll definitely want to see these episodes.  Best episode here - #2, really an amazing show.",1042761600,,1280,5.434343434343434

I don't remember what episode is from which season either. But let me tell you about the show. Trying to describe Mr. Show to friends and family usually ends in tears of frustration. ''Its funny! It really is, I'm just not telling it right!'' That kind of thing. One show goes into another one seamlessly. over the course of the few short years that it was on, the sketches were sicker and sicker, funnier and funnier, smarter and smarter and harder and harder to describe. Try explaining some of the sketches. Like the pre-natal beauty pageant. Or the cloned hitlers who served modern day jewish folks for reparations. Like the bit about two idiots trying to make their own 'make a wish foundation' type deal. Or maybe the sketch about the drunk from the reality tv cop show doing a ballad in a recording studio about being brutalized. Hell, try to explain the sketch where they act out the classic joke about a salesman and a farmer and his daughter-only they do it like a broadway musical. It just doesn't come across well. When you try to explain about why 24 is the highest number and the soap opera take on siamese twins that have been separated. The Star Trek Convention and the medievil fair being told about by civil war re-enactment historians. Good god, nobody gets it until they see it. As for bad taste- it is definetly there. As for being like Monty Python? They get away with more, they are American, and they are funnier.

If you are a big fan of network comedy, or easily insulted, or think Carrot Top is pure genius, stay away from this.

1674545,5,B00005Y3ZL,"That's really the best advice that I can give regarding this show....
There really is no rhyme or reason to whether or not you'll like Mr. Show.  People have compared it to other satire like the Simpsons, Guffman, etc...but I've shown it to people who love those things but surprisingly didn't get into Mr. Show at all.  Then I've shown it to people who I'd never think would get into it and they loved it...it's very odd.  The satire is delivered in a different way than almost anything I've ever seen.
I can tell you this, though...if you DO get into it, it's very difficult to not get completely immersed in it.  Even the skits that don't jump out at you as hilarious after one or two viewings, you'll find yourself laughing about them later and not even really knowing why.  The skits are totally random and yet completely logical.
A lot of people say that the third and fourth seasons are much funnier...I don't know about that.  I just think that the satire and humor of the first two is more implicit.  The later seasons did manage to keep the same level of quality with more accessibility though.
In short, if you typically like unconventional humor, and you find ""normality"" to be completely humorous ... trust me, it will have a permanent effect on your sense of humor.
Advice: The first episode (not the first SEASON, just the first ep.) is VERY subpar.  Don't write it off after that though, trust me.  You'll probably need to watch at least three or four episodes, maybe more than once, before even trying to formulate an opinion on this.",1037318400,,1551,4.5703971119133575

1674549,4,B00005Y3ZL,"Okay, so normally I would give this DVD a 5-star rating...but I had to give it a 4-star rating because Seasons 3&4 are even better than the first two seasons.  Now, I'm not going to tell you what sketches are in the first two seasons, because the humor is lost if you have any idea what's going to happen next.  Well, not really.  I guess the impact is lost, not the humor.  Because I've been watching these episodes since they first aired on HBO all the way back in the late 90's and I still laugh...
But, when I first watched them I didn't laugh.  It wasn't that I was shocked, but more that I was amazed at some of the ideas they put into skit form and somehow made them work.  To top it off, they blend every skit into the next, usually through a news program of some sort.  Now, that isn't entirely original, but to make the transitions just as funny as the skits before and after is quite remarkable.  Sometimes I'll find myself laughing harder at the ""in between"" stuff then I do at the main skits.
Now, some of the skits aren't all that funny.  Some are downright not funny at all, but even those few (and there really are only a few) duds are still very well written and sometimes thought provoking skits that work more as a thought provoker than they do as a laugh provoker.  Some of the skits drag on for a little too long.  Even Bob and David themselves will agree.  Seasons 3&4 are much more fast paced satire.
Ah, satire.  Some people love and understand satire.  Some people don't.  Some people need an obvious joke to make them laugh.  Other prefer a well constructed joke that you have to think about.  And sometimes the joke isn't even that funny, but you'll still laugh your ass off because of the social commentary that is being made.  For example, the whole Ronnie Dobbs idea is funny, but only because a part of you (those with a brain) know that in this sick society someone like Ronnie Dobbs could actually exist.
Now I'll admit, a lot of you won't get this show.  You'll think it's stupid.  You'll think it's boring.  You'll think it's [bad].  And you'll use big intelligent sounding words to try and take away from this brilliant and highly original sketch comedy show.  And that's fine, only because, a lot of you out there will see this show and love it.  You will love it and you will see why so many people have been and are still raving about this very short-lived series.  And those of us that love it can all agree that HBO is stupid for letting this one go.  But luckily, they realized that Mr. Show has a very loyal following and it's continuing to grow.  And hopefully, Season 3 is going to come out soon and then some of you will get to see a definite 5-star DVD.

I have given tapes of the shows to my friends to watch, and there was a definite ""adjustment period"" for some of them, people whom I thought were going to really enjoy it. I think that maybe it takes more than one viewing for some people to really get it-- the people that didn't like this were those that had rented it and only watched it once.
Honestly I can say that it will appeal to a particular type of humor that is extremely select and has a great deal to do with what you were doing in the 90s and what you thought was funny then. Lest we forget, SNL wasn't terribly funny then even though it produced supposedly comic genii like Adam Sandler et al. It won't appeal to the Sandler idea of funny, more to the Onion/Brunching Shuttlecocks idea of funny.
Funny comes and goes, but proof of how staying many of the Mr. Show sketches are is in the fact that they are still performing a couple of them in ""Hooray for America"", the Mr. Show Live tour. Admittedly when I attended the audience was completely Mr. Show fans, so there was the air of an ""inside joke"" most of the time, but nonetheless, their approach is always fresh and almost exalted in its unwillingness to succumb to the current ""sacred cow"" attitude toward American pop-culture.

To compare this to other ""sketch"" shows is futile because it isn't a typical sketch show.  The best you can compare it to is The Ben Stiller Show.  Both take topical subject matter, grind it through a pop culture blender and out comes something that is unique, twisted, sometimes a little uneven, often hilarious and always, at the very least, curious.  (Why isn't The Ben Stiller Show on DVD yet?  You'd think he is a big enough star to get that out there.)
The Talking Junkie episode is mind-blowingly funny, so for those who get mired in what they view as the rough first season, make sure you at least give that one a chance.  It best epitomizes (on these DVDs at least) what Mr. Show is really capable of.

My guess is bob&dave put it out so they could raise some money for their Ronnie Dobbs movie (which i would of gladly donated money for).
Personally i had all the shows taped, so i didn't gain a whole lot by getting the dvd.  Also the the title of the dvd says ""the complete first and second season""  even though i could of sworn there was several first and second season episodes that were not included in the dvd.  They seemed to just include the funniest episodes.
Sedondly....the special features aren't very special at all.  The audio commentary isn't anything memorable, its just bob, david &friends goofing around for a while.  They're not even very funny in it.  They tell a few neat stories about the show, but overall they just sit around and goof off.  Everyone at Mr.show can be extremely genious and halarious when they have time to write and prepare....but when you see them on the spot, having to improvise; the results aren't anything impressive.
The other feature i'll mention is the ""before it was a show"" feature.  It is in fact a one minute long tape of bob and david doing an introduction on a cheap stage.  Its really predictable if you ever watched mr.show before and looks like it was filmed by a high school audio club crew.

1674569,4,B00005Y3ZL,"I had faint memories of watching Mr. Show since I was thirteen years old and discussing the events with my friends in Middle school. In high school, I'd manage to catch an episode here and there, but its irritating timeslot (Mondays at midnight!) didn't allow me to be a consistent fan. I always remembered this show, even after it went off the air, simply because it was one of the strangest things I had ever seen on television. So when I heard that a DVD was going to come out, I preordered it and joyfully unwrapped it upon the UPS man's arrival at my doorstop. My impressions: it is certainly just as weird, if not weirder than I remember, which is a good thing. The transitions(which was the show's trademark) are often touchingly non sequitor and alluring. There is never any way to tell which direction an episode of Mr. Show is going, elements of skits sometimes reapear in subsequent skits and somehow build to a wonderfully strange and bombastic conclusion in which everyone gets together and sings a song or people emerge from the future with laserguns. Bob and David are great writers with an astute knowledge of whats funny, and they look like they're having a blast peppering the skits with tiny idiosynchrasies that make each second uniquely bizarre and funny.(something, for instance, like Abraham Lincoln having a thick New York accent for no particular reason, always seems to hit me in the gut.) The bad: the skits in these first two seasons are somewhat uneven. Every once in a while there will be an episode with 2 or three uninspired skits that I feel the need to gloss through to get to the funny stuff. The Audio commentary(which seems like a necessity on DVDs, for reasons I'll never comprehend) is almost completely superfluous. Bob and David and guest stars from the show ramble ploddingly about non sequitors and generally unfunny stuff while for the most part ignoring the subject of the show or the skits they are talking over. Every once in a while you'll get a funny insight about the show's origin, but for the most part its not that great. All in all, though, this a great price for a great DVD featuring 10 episodes worth of one of the funniest sketch comedy shows, ever. I only hope that the aparent success this DVD is achieving leads to the distribution of a DVD containing seasons 3 and 4, in which the show genuinely hit its stride and managed to synthesize the elements of wierdness with the satirical elements of the show. Then, I think, we can all be happy. So happy.",1026777600,4,2511,4.632286995515695
1674570,5,B00005Y3ZL,"There is a great hidden value for Mr. Show fans in this 2 DVD set.  The accompanying commentary by the cast is less a commentary about the show you are watching as it is a whole new Mr. Show in audio format.  While there are some remarks about the making of the show, most of the commentary is actually little adlibbed skits with fictional characters who are supposed to be fans or obscure contributors to the show.  Once again these guys have taken a predictable and sometimes mundane media and have good creative fun with it.
Beyond the enjoyment of seeing these shows again and experiencing the audio commentary,  it was helpful to view the episodes in chronological order.  It helps to understand how the show developed over its short run.
Once you're familiar with entire body of work, you can forgive the occasional ""klinker"" skit that didn't work.  Unlike an SNL klinker that makes you shake your head in disbelief, you'll typically find yourself enjoying the less successful bits, because they are rarely cliched.  They typically have something to offer, like an eccentric musical performance or just weirdness.  Also, watch for great cameos by Jeanne Tripplehorn, Janeane Garofolo (one in a Polaroid snapshot), Jack Black (who wasn't famous yet) and other familiar faces.
Describing Mr. Show to someone who hasn't seen it is difficult.  Comparisons to Monty Python are typical, but that doesn't do it justice.  It makes much more sense, and it is less silly.  It's more directly critical of the world without being a heavy handed bummer.  Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are outstanding skit actors and each member of the supporting cast has a unique dose of comedic talent.
There are some great episodes missing here which I assume will be released on subsequent disks.  I'll be first in line for that box set when it hits the stands.",1026432000,5,1841,4.843450479233227
1674571,2,B00005Y3ZL,"Let me start off by saying that this is not the high form of entertainment that the fans of Mr. Show make it out to be. The main thing the Mr. Show fans like to do is to act like it has had some sort of profound impact on them. ""I would be living under a gutter with a paper bag over my head, if it wasn't for Mr. Show!"", they seem to say to me. Then they say if I disagree with them, it's obviously because I'm not ""hip"" enough to get the show and then they recommend something they think is more on my level like, ""Friends"". They make themselves comfortable thinking that anyone who doesn't like Mr. Show is just too mainstream and ordinary. What liking this show does for them is make them feel superior to everyone else. They like to feel inside on something that mystifies everybody else. They create some sort of out of reach taste by calling the show dark, twisted, offbeat and brilliant. What you actually find when you watch it is what you find in must every sketch comedy; a bunch of guys coming up with bizarre and silly concepts that have only the purpose of being funny, not meaningful or even really intelligent.  All the fans are doing is exaggerating its importance and claiming a high-class acquired taste.
Saying this is the greatest sketch comedy of all time is blasphemous to the sketch comedy gods. The first and still the best is Monty Python and anyone who will argue against that will fail miserably. It's like trying to say Picasso isn't the greatest modern artist, when he brought it all into being. There would be no Mr. Show if Monty Python never broke in, so how can you say it's better?
Mr. Show, like all sketch comedy, has its good parts and its bad; hits and misses. The second tends to outweigh the first in the case of Mr. Show. I would say that only every other episode made me laugh. If you took every skit in Mr. Show that actually made me laugh or even caused any facial muscle reaction in any way, you would only have a 15-20 minute DVD. In comparison, the Monty Python compilation would be about an hour and a half.",1026432000,5,2056,4.3264248704663215

This show was brilliant. It is that simple. Bob and Dave provided America with 4 years of ingenuity that (like most of the truly original art of today) was never and will never be recognized for what it was. Yes, it was just a television show; no, it's not going to change the world. I acknowledge this. It's just sad to me that there's so little room for intelligence within popular media. I can even understand why many, many people would not like this. Bob and (especially) Dave, can be downright confrontational in their hostility towards stupidity... they have a complete and total disrespect for authority... many of their references are obscure... the humor itself takes some time to ""get"" (for anyone seriously considering this as a purchase, please allow yourself a couple shows to become accustomed with the humor), but so does any other worthwhile art.
 ... there IS an audience for this stuff, and it's not just pseudo-intellectual, anti-mainstream, anti-authority dweebs (read: Me). It should be what The Onion is to journalism, or The Simpsons was (about 7 years ago) to network television, or what Radiohead or Tool or REM or The Pixies or Insert_Your_Favorite_Band_That_People_Just_Don't_Get_But_That_Somehow_Still_Made_It_Relatively_Big_Here are for music. It had the ability to be that entity that MOST people look at as being ""too cynical"" or ""too weird"" or ""too loud"", but that managed to carve out a niche for itself and a not-so-insignificant following. For some reason this never happened for Mr. Show. Obviously, it developed a minor ""cult"" following, but never the level reached by some of the previously mentioned artists. Maybe because HBO never gave it a real change... I don't know. I just hope that Bob and Dave don't just fade off into obscurity as I fear they will (ie. Bill Hicks).
Anyway, if you made it this far, you're probably already a Mr. Show fan, and there's nothing more to say. If you aren't, and you had the patience for this rambling nonsense, do yourself a favor and pick up the DVD.

1674580,5,B00005Y3ZL,"I bought this on a whim because people were comparing it to Monty Python. To sum it up quickly, it was a wise purchase, and this is a very funny show. But that's not enough to say.
I believe the reason many people enjoy this show is because of what Bob said on one of the commentaries - ""The cast just has fun with it."" In Mr. Show, the unpolished humor with great ideas and great energy make a very surreal and entertaining atmosphere. Many sketch shows lack that because they're too concerned about appearances. To make it simple, people who are fans of Saturday Night Live should avoid this. Fans of shows like Monty Python, Upright Citizens Brigade, and Kids in the Hall will be more likely to enjoy it. Especially UCB - the style is almost identical, and some of the characters (Ronnie Dobbs, Odenkirk's executive persona, etc.) seem to have descendants on UCB. Not that I'm insinuating any kind of plagiarism (it looks more like UCB was inspired by Mr. Show).
The other important thing to remember about Mr. Show is that this is the FIRST and SECOND seasons, which means that at this point, the show hasn't really gathered a lot of momentum. There are plenty of jokes, and these episodes are hilarious - but they seem bumpy at times, and not quite developed. To fully enjoy them, you have to have some patience. The later episodes in Season 2 are the strongest of the bunch, but you can see that Bob and David are still toying around with the show to see what works. Now I can't wait for the next DVD release, when things are sure to be great.

1674591,4,B00005Y3ZL,"I don't think I can accurately describe Mr. Show to someone who's never seen it--you really do have to see it to understand what all the fuss is about. If you like subtle comedy, look elsewhere! This is over-the-top farce! Lots of foul language is used and common taboos are totally ignored (e.g. homosexuality, drugs, religion, terminal illness, child abuse, etc.) It's absurd and eerie--sometimes the depth and realism of the characters portrayed can be downright creepy, which makes it all the more funny to those with a twisted sense of humor (like me).
The show is done in front of a live audience, but many segments are taped on location. There's no particular formula to it--it's all for effect (read: filmed on a shoe-string budget).  Fortunately, they had some very skilled editors working on the finished product, allowing every scene to brilliantly and seamlessly segue into the next. Good luck keeping up with the rapid-fire pace on first viewing!  The show gets even better upon repeated viewing.
The DVDs are very good. The bonus features are a... er... bonus.  Several promotional spots are included, as well as ""FUZZ: The Musical (Featuring Ronnie Dobbs)"" and ""Best of Mr. Show""--a newscast that appears to be dated sometime in the late 70's or early 80's that has been dubbed-over by Bob and David with some very funny dialogue and cut-scenes thrown in.  There's more, but nothing that tops the show itself.
One very MINOR complaint: When you select an episode, the DVD asks you to choose if you would like audio commentary for the episode.  It wouldn't be so annoying if it didn't default to ""Yes"".  The show is much funnier with no commentary (it's a little droll and often doesn't blend well with the scene that's being shown).  That is not to say that I don't like the commentary--I do appreciate the fact that they included it. Bob and David slip in and out of some very funny characters, and they point out a lot of interesting things about the sets, characters and subtle touches you simply wouldn't notice otherwise.

If every country had to pick one sketch troupe to fight it out in a  Sketch Comedy Battle Royal: Canada would get ""the Kids.."", England would have ""the Pythons"", and The U.S. would get ""Bob & David and friends"". And it would be a close fight to call. It became a cult hit with a rabid fan base usually reserved for Star Wars and Trekkies. And it has deserved every bit of it. Never before had a show been SO balls to the wall funny. It only lasted for 4 seasons but they are all available now for you to revel in. This IS the greatest sketch show ever. God Bless America and God Bless Mr. Show.",1021852800,,1012,4.326315789473684

There are dozens and dozens of sketches that make me roll when I think about them. I won't go into detail here, but you should definitely pick up a copy of the DVD. And what a bargain! Can you put a price on joy? Amazon has, and it's cheap! Write it off as a medical expense. Laughter is good for the body, after all...",1021593600,,422,4.096385542168675

But as an American with a Brain, drowning in the banality of the modern age (and sometimes loving it), I would have to say that, for me, Mr. Show tops even those lads from London.  If you love funny, if you love sarcasm, if you love excessive swearing, this is the must-own boxed set of the year.

David: Might wanna get some hair, boy. Whats with the gen-X clothes, man? Whats with the glasses? You need em for something? What are you...a reader? I think we might have a reader here.
Bob: Mister sophisticato. Nice jacket. Super hair. Aren't you to old for this [stuff]? Why not give some of your thick and full hair to David?
Anyways, I got this DVD set for free as a advance reviewers copy. Well here is what I think people can do with this DVD ""set"": Through it in a shredder and duck, cause the DVD's are going to cut into little pieces and they will fly all around the room and cut anything that comes in their way.

1674607,5,B00005Y3ZL,"Mr. Show is by far the funniest sketch comedy show out there, unfortunately it didn't last too long. The reason why the show is so great is that most of the themes on the show don't make a whole lot of sense or too much sense. If it hadn't been for HBO, this would have never have been made due to its large amount of its necessary swearing and content that you would never see on a major network, they push the envelope too much. Bob Odenkerk and David Cross are a couple of the funniest comedians alive and if you haven't heard of them before, after seeing this you will never forget them. If you liked Kids In the Hall, then you will absolutely love this. Buy this DVD, it's worth it and you will laugh your behind off!",1020297600,2,722,4.164285714285715

For those who have not enjoy Mr. Show, contain much jokes.  It have itself some of the funnier jokes on television in many decades.  Take yourself for example the poop jokes.  Take it a funny time for TWO!
Some much people are to have enjoy Mr. Show.  I take sometime an episode to myself for a watch episode.  Makes itself one for a laugh, especially for me.  That makes a good deal for price, especially with two episode.

It seems that New Line still can't make up their mind whether or not they want to release the film. I'd rather they release Ronnie on video than not at all, but with indecision lies hope perhaps? Anyway, the Mr. Show DVDs are ready to be shipped, thousands of them anxiously wait us in a mysterious warehouse somewhere. Hopefully HBO really has made up it's mind and will release these in June.

This comedy series ranks up there with the movie ""Waiting For Guffman"" as the funniest thing to come along in years. No small coincidence that both of the stars and creative geniuses behind Mr. Show (David Cross and Bob Odenkirk) appeared in ""Guffman"". Cross is easy to spot, but blink and you'll miss Odenkirk.
This HBO series' humor soars miles above the heads of some viewers, and too bad for them. Offbeat, strange, twisted, and always extremely clever, ""Mr. Show"" reaffirms your faith in sketch comedy. The sketches defy description, but my favorite is the one where Odenkirk enters a convenience store to ask for change for a dollar. Sounds flat, huh? But employee Cross has to go through several links of the chain of command (4 other roles all played by Cross and Odenkirk), all the way up to the President of the United States, just to get clearance. Just guess what the answer ends up being... Cross and Odenkirk are the principal writers of this series, and their ingenious use of pre-taped segments cleverly intermixed with ""live"" segments demonstrates not only their mastery of the medium, but their effortlessness at thumbing their noses at standard sitcom & sketch conventions.",1015372800,81,1386,4.877118644067797

The next disk had six episodes, and only four of them played.

There is some talk about ""slackers"" in a sketch or two, but it still isn't so tied in with the pop culture of the time that it's now dated.  A few of the sketches fall a little flat here and there, but the overall quality of the writing and performances is very high.

Highly recommended, and all of the seasons are worthwhile and contain classic sketches.",1374019200,,540,4.264705882352941
