8560153,5,B00B04KVOA,"This is probably one of my favorite anime series.  Initially, the animation style put me off, because it seemed to be a different than standard character designs.  But, it grew on me and i started to enjoy its style more and more as the episodes progressed.

The basic premise?  The story revolves around the a group of high-school students, set on a very large (k-12?) campus.  One of these girls has a very keen ability for attracting friends / people towards her.  As the series progresses, Torako obtains more friends between her classmates, helps them with some struggles, and you dig a little bit into her life.  The story had a lot of funny and interesting moments.
The animation was different, yet beautiful and clean.  The series had a diverse cast of characters of all styles.  The story had a couple or twists, but nothing that would lose a person.  My favorite aspect is the music.  During the lulls or moments of reflection, there are some beautiful pieces that played in the background.  The whole series left me feeling happy and peaceful.

I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll leave it at, 'I hope you enjoy / enjoyed the series as much as I did!'",1381536000,,1167,4.634146341463414
8560154,5,B00B04KVOA,"This was an pleasing surprise, HYAKKO is a slice of life comedy about the students of the Kamizono Academy, a fictional gigantic private institution designed ""to bring up talents of students in all departments and fields"" (Elementary, Middle and High), The story revolves around four friends Torako Kageyama, Ayumi Nonomura, Tatsuki Iizuka, and Suzune Saotome interacting with their classmates, teacher and relatives.

Produced by Nippon Animation the anime adaptation is extremely faithful to the manga.  The way they exploit the clichd characters of every moeblob anime was perfect while maintaining that clever tongue in cheek humorous tone.  This anime requires the suspension of all disbelief because it deals with inappropriate behavior in school, things like vandalism, sexual harassment or assaulting the homeroom teacher are surprisingly enjoyable to watch.

CONS:
- The ending theme doesn't fit with the mood of the show.
- Artistry sometimes isn't as sharp.
- The last two episodes tell Torako's tragic background, and become more of a drama than a comedy.
- No English dub.

PROS:
- Price.
- Opening.
- Fan service.
- Japanese voice actors are as always topnotch.
- Vivid and Fluent animation.
- Colorful comedy packed with many gags.
- Suzume.
- Surprisingly funny.

Hyakko is a heartwarming tale of friendship and bizarre situations. All characters are likable and memorable, each of them has a unique and interesting personality, overall it's a satisfying comedy that demands multiple viewings, if you like Azumanga Daioh, K-ON or Ninja Nonsense then you'll love this show, 5 out of 5.",1369094400,,1600,5.2795275590551185
8560155,4,B00B04KVOA,"The campus of Kamizono Academy is huge. Larger enough to get lost in! Which is exactly what happens to Ayumi and Tastuki on their first day of high school. While trying to find their way, they meet Torako and her best friend Suzume. Toroko immediately takes charge and leads the way. Too bad she is lost too.

Hyakko is about four girls who become friends through the force Torako's character. She brings them together, and then forces them to participate in her rather hair-brained schemes. The story mostly episodic, without much of an overall line. There is some background on Torako near the end which is a little more serious and adds some depth to the series.

I saw the first episode of Hyakko twice and didn't like it either time. But my sister enjoyed it, so I endured. After a few episodes I began to enjoy it, and by the end I thought of the series fondly. Torako is annoying, but she is also a fun character. And with only 13 episodes, the series is the perfect length for the story.

Hyakko is light and fluffy fun and is good for at least one viewing.",1368662400,3,1065,4.423469387755102
8560156,5,B00B04KVOA,"What do you get when you average out the sum of Nichijou and Azumanga Daioh? The answer is Hyakko. I'll be the first to admit that the slow paced humor will drive some viewers batty with boredom. However, if you're a fan of it, this is an excellent series and a must pick-up. Graphically speaking, this series is entirely average with decent animation. Audio-wise, the voice actors are diverse and enthusiastic accompanied by an admittedly bland soundtrack. The comedy, as previously stated, is where the show truly shines; It's suprisingly clever for a high school romp, with the jokes being built up to a punchline, instead of just being decked with gag after gag. Welcomed doses of randomness are spaced through-out help to even out the flow. In short, this series proves that beauty is more than skin deep.",1365984000,7,810,4.83453237410072
8560157,1,B00B04KVOA,I have not seen a anime so poorly done in years. I have seen anime by these people that is 100 times better. If i had seen a preview i would never have ordered this one.,1365897600,,169,3.7222222222222223
