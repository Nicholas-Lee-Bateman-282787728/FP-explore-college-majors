4989188,5,B006H4RAS8,"Though we did not watch Doctor Who until the new adventures began in 2004, it meant that we were not introduced to Sarah Jane Smith until after she had already set up on Earth her own mission to deal with aliens.  Not only have we enjoyed all the DVDs from her own show, we have even bought old ones when she was an associate for two past doctors.  Sadly Elizabeth Sladen's death means no more Sarah Jane Adventures, however we are sure she is having even greater ones now.",1347494400,2,473,4.303370786516854
4989189,5,B006H4RAS8,"It's hard to see such a iconic actress pass when she has generations of fans, she is most famous for playing Sarah Jane Smith and this is her last season, which as you know was cut short but it lives up to all the others, if a fan you must buy this

Good Bye Elisabeth Sladen you are not forgotten",1344988800,2,297,3.95
4989190,5,B006H4RAS8,"I still get tears in my eyes over the loss of Elisabeth Sladen.  As a long time fan of the original Doctor Who (I started with Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor and his best-loved companion, fiesty reporter Sarah Jane Smith.)  The Sarah Jane Smith Adventures was one of the better spin-offs I've seen (how could it be less?  It was Doctor Who and Sarah Jane Smith), more child-friendly but often just as exciting as the also-wonderful Torchwood.  Even though it was meant for a far younger audience than I, I found it a hugely entertaining series and looked forward to each release on DVD (unfortunately after the first season, none of my television channels carried it so I was forced to wait).  Losing Ms. Sladen felt almost like losing a childhood friend, and I was so glad they released the last episodes.  She was always Sarah Jane, always fiesty, always couragous, and always a lady.",1341014400,41,881,4.688311688311688
4989191,5,B006H4RAS8,"Elisabeth Sladen was a lovely person and an actor that i always looked forward to seeing on her show ""The Sarah Jane Adventures""..  To me she felt more like part of my family.
She seemed more like a mom (a very cool mom)that i could watch from episode to episode knowing she and her kids would save the day or the world in many cases..I knew that would happen and that made me feel good inside...I cried when i heard she had died..as i believe many others cried, too. This last bit of (Sarah Jane)...Elisabeth Sladen is all we will ever get...it is excellent..as i expected it to be...Sarah Jane Season 5...is goodbye....and i am glad i have it...given to me by a friend..I'll buy another on Amazon.com....and i am sad the adventures are over...Goodbye Elisabeth....Goodbye Sarah...",1340668800,27,782,4.708029197080292
4989192,5,B006H4RAS8,SARAH JANE ADVENTURES IS SUCH A ENTERTAINING SERIES.  I LOVE THE IMAGINATION THAT GOES INTO THE PLOTS.  THE CHARACTERS ARE FUN AND I HONESTLY LOVE THEM.  I LIKE SARAH JANE BECAUSE SHE IS A FUN AND VERY SMART LADY.  I AM SAD THAT THE STAR OF THIS SHOW HAS PASSED AWAY.  I WILL MISS SARAH JANE.,1334966400,12,292,4.142857142857143
4989193,5,B006H4RAS8,"This is the last filmed series of episodes of 'The Sarah Jane Adventures' before Elisabeth Sladen's unexpected death in April 2011. I'm glad to see that not only did BBC broadcast this final group of episodes, but has made them available around the world on DVD to fans of Miss Sladen and the show.

In this release we will get 16:9 (1.78:1), Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo sound and English subtitles. The lone extra is ""Goodbye Bannerman Road - Remembering Elisabeth Sladen"" which is a twenty-minute tribute to Miss Sladen by those that worked with her on the series, including current 'Doctor Who' star Matt Smith. Sadly, the ""My Sarah Jane"" special that aired on CBBC shortly after Miss Sladen's death is not included.

Series 5 consists of six episodes (out of the originally planned twelve), which make up three stories: ""Sky,"" ""The Curse of Clyde Langer,"" and ""The Man Who Never Was."" New character Sky didn't have much time to develop due to the shortened amount of episodes filmed, so there is a weakness of her presence most of the time. Of these three stories, I think ""The Curse of Clyde Langer"" is possibly one of the best of the entire run of the series. It is certainly powerful acting from Daniel Anthony. Those fearing that we are left with major dangling plots can rest assured that we do get a heartfelt tag at the end that appropriately wraps-up 'The Sarah Jane Adventures' and Elisabeth Sladen's loving devotion playing Sarah Jane Smith.

Although primarily aimed at children, this is a delightful and thoughtful program that appeals to all age groups. It is well-written with emphasis on characters, but also with plenty of action, humor and engaging plotlines. This is mainly due to showrunner Russell T. Davis (Exec. Producer & head writer for 'Doctor Who' 2005 - 2010) and his team who does not dumb down any of their writing or subject matter the way many children's and adult programs woefully do today.

The main attraction goes to star Elisabeth Sladen who always holds together the integrity of keeping the relationships as human and real as possible while surrounded with fantastical situations. The focus of the series is always on the building and maintaining of family, the respect between Sarah Jane and her younger friends, and always trying to do what is right even when it is difficult. These ethics come across loud and clear from Elisabeth Sladen's performance, which in turn inspired everyone who worked on the show to do the same.

Series 5 is a fitting showcase and finale for a terrific program.",1330646400,150,2533,4.8271889400921655
4989194,5,B006H4RAS8,"So sorry to see the series end with the death of Elisabeth Sladen.  Truly there is
no way they could have continued with a substitute.  She is the one and only.
Also enjoyed the bonus describing her relationship with the kids.",1426550400,,226,4.487804878048781

4989197,1,B006H4RAS8,"Was looking forward to watching but the product was defective and would not play.  So was series four, twice.  This was the Blu-Ray version.  Amazon needs to figure this out.",1413590400,,174,4.733333333333333
4989198,5,B006H4RAS8,"The final season (or at the Brits call it Series) of the Sarah Jane Adventures kept up the series excellent quality.  The introduction of a new ""space orphan"" sweetened it up again after Sarah's adopted son goes off to University.  They never completed filming the 5th Series and it's a shame the the BBC couldn't have come up with a replacement for Sladen after her unfortunate and untimely death.  Sarah Jane, had, after all traveled with the doctor and with all the twists and turns in the Who series and this spin off you'd have thoughts that some sort of ""rebirth"" or regeneration could have been miraculously pulled off to transition to a new Sarah Jane.  I give the last episodes high marks--I give BBC lower marks for not making BlueRay editions available and not finding a way to continue this unique program--there are some extras, but it's impossible not to be sad remembering Sladen didn't live to finish out the season.",1409788800,,932,4.734567901234568
4989199,4,B006H4RAS8,"Haven't viewed all the dvds, so I can't comment on the overall technical quality- so far so good.
For the content of the shows, that's a matter of personal taste that should be left up to the viewer:  I'm a fan, but that's a personal taste.",1405641600,,240,4.217391304347826

4989201,5,B006H4RAS8,"Elisabeth Sladen lost her battle with cancer shortly after the filming of this last series of the show. Our family had been watching her in the role of Sarah Jane Smith since she was a companion to Dr. Who, and we feel like we've lost an old friend. The storylines are geared towards younger viewers, but scifi fans will also enjoy the various creatures involved.",1400112000,4,363,4.6
4989202,5,B006H4RAS8,"I think this is a wonderful series for children from 9 to 92. The unexpected and unfortunate end of this show as it prepared to reinvigorate itself by introducing a new character and move forward is at once exciting, fun and deeply saddening. Ms. Sladen was every bit the lady and clearly loved by all who worked with her. It is a shame that she was taken so swiftly and it is our loss that she was.",1399420800,7,399,4.194805194805195
4989203,5,B006H4RAS8,"I have all five seasons of this wonderful show.  I found it quite by accident at my library.  When I put together the pieces of the few newer Dr. Who episodes in which Elisabeth Sladen appeared, I fell completely in love with the series.  It was so sad that we lost this wonderful actress too soon to do another five years.  The series had enough story lines to go on and on.

You have episodes with Matt Smith as the Doctor and cross over episodes with the Slitheen and other creepy crawlies from the Who series. Earlier series have episodes with earlier Doctors.  All are great fun as the youngsters work with Sarah Jane to save the earth.

The story of how she ""adopted"" her son gave some added depth to the series.  All the young actors were excellent and they made a unified troupe who seemed to read each others' minds.

If you're a Who fan and you have kids, or if you're just a kid yourself, you'll find the whole series great for a ""Saturday afternoon in the rain with popcorn.""  Enjoy!",1396569600,8,995,4.358695652173913
4989204,5,B006H4RAS8,"Sarah was and is one of the greatest companions the Doctor ever had.  Her spin off series is a breath of fresh old time Dr Who,  Try it you will love her.",1389225600,2,154,3.78125
4989205,5,B006H4RAS8,"I would like to get all of the series, but they are a bit pricey. It is an excellent Dr. Who spin-off. So if you like Dr. Who on a junior level you will enjoy the show. Pre-teens should like it as well and maybe some teens who are into sci-fi and adventure. Whenever they are on sale I will pick up another season. I really enjoy seeing Elisabeth Sladen (RIP) as Sarah Jane, just needed more K-9 in action.",1377820800,,406,4.0875
4989206,5,B006H4RAS8,I love Elisabeth Sladen.  Sarah Jane is my favorite companion for the Doctor.  I was touched by the farewell tribute for Ms. Sladen.,1373241600,,132,4.695652173913044
4989207,5,B006H4RAS8,"Even as an adult, I found this series to be very entertaining.  I liked Sarah Jane with John Pertwee and Tom Baker and liked her on her own in her own series.  Ms. Sladen, if you can hear this in Heaven, I will miss you.",1371686400,2,220,3.8666666666666667
4989208,5,B006H4RAS8,"Especially with the death of Elisabeth Sladen, this is an important addition to the Sarah Jane Adventures. The episodes were very good, but bitter-sweet knowing beforehand of Ms. Sladen's passing and that these would be the last episodes to be created.",1368835200,2,252,5.170731707317073
4989209,5,B006H4RAS8,"A short, but exciting season.  I mourn for Liz Sladen and her beloved character, Sarah Jane Smith.

These three stories were in the top ten on my favorites list.  And the tribute to Liz is amazing.

4989210,5,B006H4RAS8,My Bro made me a Doctor Who fan and my family loves this series as well. I have all the Sara Jane sets. I will miss Elizabeth Sladen the first actress who played The Doctor's first sidekick. Great serieas for teens and up.,1362441600,2,222,4.186046511627907

4989213,5,B006H4RAS8,The only drawback is it's only five episodes but Sladen was great and her success was well deserved shame she passed so early in life,1358985600,,133,4.36
4989214,3,B006H4RAS8,"Don't get me wrong, this was a great season, but i don't think it's worth 14.99. It only has 10 aka 5 episodes on it. I wish it was at least 8.99",1357257600,,145,3.5625
4989215,4,B006H4RAS8,"I thoroughly enjoyed the series. The four stars is for content. I had to take 1 star off because the transfer is not up to HD standards. The company squeezed all the episodes on one disk so although there aren't that many episodes, the video quality shows that some compression may have been done to fit the material on one disk. Hopefully when they do a Blu-ray compilation of all 5 series they will address the video quality matter.

BTW the quality prob may only obvious to me because I watched it a 100 foot screen. I am not sure if anyone watching on a 50 or even 60 incher will notice anything unusual.

RIP Sarah Jane.",1356912000,,625,4.333333333333333

4989221,5,B006H4RAS8,"Sarah Jane had always been my favorite companion on Doctor Who, so I was very pleased to see Elisabeth Sladen given this excellent spin off.  Sadly, with her premature death in 2011 this will be the last series.  Only complaint is with production team who chose to keep the background/music sound volumn so loud it was always difficult to hear the actors speak.  For me that was a consistant issue for all series of this show.

Elisabeth Sladen will be missed.",1348272000,2,460,4.6419753086419755
