8518811,4,B007K7IBCU,"My 4 year old son first discovered Cecile and Pepo from the Summer Olympics DVD they had at our local library.  He watched it over and over again and made us check it out several times.  He kept asking why there were no winter sports on there, so I checked the library for the Winter Olympics DVD but they didn't have it.  When I found this on Amazon, it was a no brainer to buy it.  My son loves this one just as much as the Summer Olympics DVD and it has him excited for the next Olympics!",1358553600,,491,3.979591836734694
