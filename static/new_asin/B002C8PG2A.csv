8363609,5,B002C8PG2A,"This video is awesome.  It highlights the power of the Navys amazing aircraft carriers and the thousands of hard working people that make them ""Super Carriers"".  It was filmed during a work up, or preparation for a deployment to the middle east.  I served aboard this ship during the filming, and it made me proud to watch.  If you want to see how the Navy projects power around the world and protects our country, then watch this video.",1348012800,12,437,4.564102564102564
8363610,3,B002C8PG2A,"This package must be a marketing screw up. Its called Super Carrier and only 1 of the 4 discs stated was related to an aircraft carrier. I only got to watch DVD 1 and hence my review is only limited to that. But if the reader was interested due to the package title, I believe that should be sufficed.

This documentary on USS Eisenhower is NOT on war footage. It's about trial on the Carrier and her crew before its commissioned operational. Thus it's a baptism of fire, before it earned its rights to carry live ordinance and support in theater of conflict.

It's a nice documentary, but no show with a limited time-span of 80 minutes can adequately captured a floating war city with 5000 crews, not to mention supporting towns (vessels like destroyers, submarines)

The show mainly focused on the pilots who need to fly the planes off and thereafter land on the carrier, the deck crews coordinating on the deck and the control tower. With clear presentations, it adequately educated the audiences on the challenges the pilots and crews faced to perform the main task delivering the planes via the carriers.

It managed to draw out the amount of training given to these deck operations, the constant emphasis on safely, the dedication of the crews and the importance the command placed on it. On the last point, the control tower and certain parts of the landing decks were actually staff by ex-pilots, did illustrate to non-naval personnel like me, the commitment the command placed on this deck operations.

To add a sense of risks and realism to the operations on the deck and the peril of taking off and landing on it, it has made good use of past film footages of other carrier's accidents to the supplement it.

A little bit on the cons. There were not enough attentions placed on the supporting ships for the Carrier, though a nice simulation model was made of it. Other aspects of the Carrier were not mentioned, other than probably the risky maneuver of the Carrier refueling to receive its fuel for the fighter planes (the Carrier itself is nuclear powered).

It tried a little too hard on ""affirmative actions"", by squeezing 1 female pilot to appear on the show, to say how well she's been taken care of by her crew, made the show seemed a little like naval recruitment adverts.

The show also did not have enough time to show more other aspect of the carrier and how did the crew socially live and interact in such a confide space. It did mention that support crew operating below the landing deck, may not see it at all. It does makes one curious, how did they pass the time of not seeing the sun and feeling the air (as the expectation is that this is not a submarine)

On the whole, I give it a 3 stars. After watching the show, it did give me the feel on some aspects of the carrier operations.",1272672000,5,2812,4.541501976284585
