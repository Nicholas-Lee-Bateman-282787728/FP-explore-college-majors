GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT COMPLETE SONGS AND LIVE MUSIC. NOT SOME SUB-PAR CHEESEBALL HARP PLAYER WHO THINKS HE ALONE DISCOVERED THE BLUES AND IS A ""REAL"" BLUES MUSICIAN. I'D RATHER HAVE SEEN THE FEMALE BARTENDER INTERVIEW LONNIE AT LEAST WE'D HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. I'VE BEEN TO BUDDY GUY'S LEGENDS MANY TIMES AND HAVE SEEN LONNIE BROOKS NUMEROUS TIMES. THESE COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER BUT, YOU GET WHAT YA PAY FOR. IT'S NICE TO SEE LONNIE AND HIS SON PLAYING LIVE THEY HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY ON STAGE EVEN IF THE PERFORMANCES ARE CUT SHORT. BUDDY GUY IS A GREAT ENTERTAINER BUT, WHEN I SEEN HIM SITTING AT THE BAR ONE NITE IN HIS OWN CLUB SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS FOR $5 A POP AFTER THE PATRONS HAD ALL READY PAID TO GET IN AND ARE BUYING HIS WARES AND CLUB PRICED BOOZE. I THOUGHT MAN HE'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY AND HE'S SURE NO BB KING....KIND OF LIKE THIS DVD. BUDDY REMINDED ME OF THE OLD TIME WRESTLERS TRYING TO SELL THEIR WARES BEFORE THE MATCH TO MILK A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS OUT OF THEIR LOYAL FANS. BLUES AIN'T ABOUT MONEY IT'S ABOUT NOT MAKING MONEY....I REMEMBER READING SOMEWHERE THAT AFTER BUDDY FIRST CAME TO CHICAGO HE WAS HUNGRY AND WAS GONNA GO BACK HOME BUT, OTIS RUSH GAVE HIM A SANDWICH AND SOME ENCOURAGEMENT TO STAY SO HE STAYED. JUST THINK IF OTIS WOULD HAVE CHARGED HIM $5 FOR THAT SANDWICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHICAGO BLUES JAM AT OTIS RUSH'S LEGENDS..OH WELL LONG LIVE THE KING...BB THAT IS...",1249862400,,1581,4.36271186440678
8083915,1,B000B9E2QI,"Incomplete songs, it is a shame what the Director did to these great artists. I thought I was buying a concert but all this is advertisement for Legends. Some the artists in this series have not been available previously on DVD. I only hope someday they will be released in concert form so the artists can be truly appreciated. The producer and director should have checked their ego at the door.",1137456000,5,396,4.591549295774648
