Back to this movie. The movie is about finding love and losing it, hence the title. All the actors are topnotch, Moritz Bleibtreu (The Experiment), Alexandra Maria Lara (Downfall), Uwe Ochsenknecht (Das Boot). helmut Dietl, the director was one of my favorite for many years. He made many very successful movies in Germany in the 80's and 90's. Something must have happened, because this movie is the first after 8 years.
Anyways, if you like European Movies that are going straight from A to B, this is one for you.",1382400000,,694,4.604838709677419
