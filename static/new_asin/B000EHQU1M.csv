2520873,4,B000EHQU1M,"Poliakoff's drama is thoughtfully presented here, but I did get a little lost trying to follow it. The actors were superb.",1264982400,,122,4.857142857142857
2520874,5,B000EHQU1M,"""Gideon's Daughter"" is a film written and directed by the brilliant Stephen Poliakoff.  Poliakoff's movies focus on a slice of life at a particular moment in history; he tries to capture what is then happening in England and how it might affect the future.  The second disk in this set explores his philosophy in depth and how it impacts his films.

In this movie, Poliakoff captures the emptiness of celebrity culture, particularly at the time of Princess Diana's death, when it had reached unheard of heights. Bill Nighy, one of England's best actors, portrays a PR guru who is at the pinnacle of his career, and whose ""guidance"" just everyone wants.  Ironically, Nighy's character is divorced from all those around him, grieving over the broken relationship with his hostile daughter.  He is also immersed in a new relationship with Miranda Richardson.  His unresponsiveness is interpreted by different people to meet their own expectations, so the farther he drifts from PR, the more they clamor for his help.

This is an outstanding film, beautifully acted, superbly written that is totally absorbing.  Highly recommended.",1233446400,26,1127,5.153846153846154
2520875,5,B000EHQU1M,"What a joy to see a compelling, totally intriguing story beautifully  acted by a cast that does not appear to be acting: Bill Nighy, Miranda Richardson,Emily Blunt,Robert Lindsey, Ronny Anacona, Tom Hardy & company.  Bill NIghy is a treasure. Miranda Richardson, too. Never miss their movies. The screenplay and direction of Steven Poliokoff  are so creatively  conceived as to be mesmerizing. What a pleasure to see a writer/director who truly presents a fully developed movie.  We love the metaphorical quality of the stroy, and appreciate the fact that it enhances, without getting in the way. Gideon's Daughter is a jewel that we first rented, and immediatly purchased,becasue we ant to see it again.",1171497600,24,704,5.1946902654867255
2520876,4,B000EHQU1M,"As both a parent and a grandparent and also having lost a child in infancy, I found this movie extremely satisfying in terms of the emotions it portrayed.  I really got into it.  It's hard to go wrong with the star power involved and they worked well together - I'd like to see more of this caliber - on American TV for a change.

2520899,4,B000EHQU1M,"When can you go wrong watching Bill Nighy? Never. Good film, weird premise. But it delivers in the end. For awhile, I thought it was taking me places I didn't want to go, but it came back around. If you are a fan of Bill Nighy, get it.",1424736000,,235,3.9166666666666665
2520900,5,B000EHQU1M,ANYTHING with Bill Nighy in it becomes quality. This was a really good movie on top of his stellar presence.,1422057600,,108,4.45
2520901,5,B000EHQU1M,"A beautiful and deeply touching film.  A real joy to sit back and feel entertained and yet inspired by the story and it's portrayal.  Loved the walk through Princess Diana's memorial of flowers, very moving and so colorful.",1419379200,,223,4.842105263157895
2520902,4,B000EHQU1M,Watched this ONLY because of Bill Nighy and I was not disappointed.  As usual he was wonderful.  The movie is a little strange and the strained relationship with his daughter at first a little disconcerting.  But the story is so intriguingly quirky that all else is forgiven.  Was not sure what I would make of this movie but ended up REALLY liking it,1402444800,,351,4.523809523809524
2520903,5,B000EHQU1M,"I have a large collection of DVDs, and this movie is a very special addition.
It was interesting to learn about the creative ideas behind it.",1400889600,,141,4.461538461538462
2520904,5,B000EHQU1M,This is a great movie .  Classic Bill Nighy.  It was so interesting to see Emily Blunt in one of her first roles.,1362268800,,113,3.869565217391304
2520905,2,B000EHQU1M,"All those stars from seven reviewers ?!?!?  Amazing.  Might the unbelievably generous four and five star reviewers have been blinded to the fact that this is incoherent nonsense by their fondness for Nighy and Blunt, or Richardson? I think they're great too, even here, but they can't salvage this mess of a screenplay.  Cheap shots abound: the grieving parents, both of them loony enough to let such a young child ride on such a dangerous street and going loonier after his death; the absurd media mogul Nighy is supposed to court; the tasteless misuse of Diana; that embarrassing song.  It's all just too much, too far-fetched and too silly.",1337990400,3,643,4.871559633027523
2520906,4,B000EHQU1M,Emily Blunt is excellent and so beautiful in this movie. Bill Nighy gives another outstanding performance and is perfect for his role.,1332720000,,134,5.136363636363637
2520907,4,B000EHQU1M,"If you've read the works of Poliakoff, you'll want to see the movies. Gideon's Daughter stars Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt. Their relationship is what makes the film and these two actors are two of the best. Both have gone on to greater heights. This is one film you must see. You won't be disappointed.",1318464000,3,301,4.490909090909091
2520908,4,B000EHQU1M,"I saw ""Gideon's Daughter"" largely because Emily Blunt (who I --along with probably 10-20 percent of my fellow men-- am smitten by) is in the film.  And I'm glad I did because it's a good and affecting story.  But while the film is called ""Gideon's Daughter,"" the movie isn't so much about Blunt's character Natasha.  Rather it's about Gideon (Bill Nighy) and Stella (played very well by Miranda Richardson).  Gideon, an uber-public relations wonk, a man who seemingly has it all, is slowly dying inside over fears that he has permanently lost Natasha's love.  Stella is a working class divorcee whose marriage fell apart after the tragic death of her son in a traffic accident.  The two come into each other's orbit and fall in love while Gideon tries desperately to reach out to his daughter.

I only have three criticisms of this film.  One is that it did not give Emily Blunt very much to do.  In most of her scenes she comes across as cold and aloof when she talks with her dad (which is appropriate but I think she could have been given more to work with).  She only really comes alive near the end of the movie.  Second, I didn't really like the narration of the movie.  Combined with the score, it almost came across as though the film makers felt ""Gideon's Daughter"" needed to be depicted as something profound and almost mythological.  Finally, while I felt Blunt did well in the limited role she had, she was not really plausible as a 17 or 18 year old (she was either 21 or 22) when the film was made, and it was a stretch to see her as the equivalent of a high school senior or college freshman (just a minor point but I think casting an actual teenager would have made more sense).

What's interesting to me is that this is not the only time where Nighy and Blunt have worked together.  She and he starred in the 2010 black comedy ""Wild Target"" in which she played a confidence woman and he an assassin and they were a couple instead of father and daughter (and despite the age gap, I thought they pulled it off).  What is truly impressive about both actors is that both of them appear totally different and one would have to be looking to see they are the same people, which is testimony to their skill.

8110218,3,B000EHQU1M,"It could've been a 5-star movie if not for the very bovine Emily Blunt, seething with hostility in the title role, who ruins it.",1524441600,,128,4.375
8110219,4,B000EHQU1M,"This was a strange film in that it took awhile to figure out what the storyline was all about. Bill Nighy plays Gideon, a rare PR man who seems to work miracles without much background work. His attention span is nil, but celebrities from all over the world come seek8ngbhis expertise. What we do know is that Gideon seems to have lost the trust and love of his daughter, Natasha, played by Emily Blubt,  after the death of her mom and his ex-wife. He spends a great deal of time trying to grab her love, but not much conversation takes place.

We meet many of Gideons colleagues and friends. He has several women friends, but it is not until he meets Miranda Richardson, a kooky woman, who has lost her son to a cycle accident. They connect and wha5 that means is up to you. Lots of wonderful and unusual London scenery! And we are taken to out of the way places. Bill Nighy seems spacey and that is exactly what this film brings.

8110222,5,B000EHQU1M,I love this movie and believe me I'm not a sap. But it really is a beautiful story about a father and daughter and what happens when a parent holds on too tight. And then there's a bonus sideline story about romantic love with the great Miranda Richardson. Bill Nighy couldn't be better. Also includes one great song sung by Emily Blunt. What more coud you ask for?,1510358400,,365,4.382352941176471
8110223,5,B000EHQU1M,"Poliakov  has a way of telling stories that sometimes seem quirky, and never obvious where the story arc is headed. But the slow,seemingly barely connected vignettes build a complete picture. A snap shot of a moment complete with its repertoire of feelings and emotions. Some work better than others, and it does depends on the quality of acting. This has an  excellent cast. One of his three of four finest works. Highly recommended.",1508889600,,434,4.931506849315069
