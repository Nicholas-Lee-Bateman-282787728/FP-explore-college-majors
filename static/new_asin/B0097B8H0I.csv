8537391,5,B0097B8H0I,"I've read dog training books,, watched videos, attended training classes, and seminars on the subject of dog training.  However, it wasn't until I watched this video that I got a clear idea of the basic fundamentals behind dog training.  Mr. Ellis clearly explains his philosophy, the science on which his philosophy is based, and then demonstrates practical application of it.

Of course, this video is not for the novice who only wishes to teach his dog to come when called.  Instead it deals with a narrow (but essential) part of dog training, namely how to use rewards and punishment in motivating and training a dog.  Its a vital part of training to those of us who exhibit our dogs but its one that often remains a mystery.

Now Mr. Elis provides a clear approach to the task based on science combined with experience.  The video is both informative and thought provoking.  Its one to watch again and again to both learn and absorb its principles.  It won't collect dust on my book shelf.",1364342400,4,994,4.699421965317919
