Blue Oyster Cult are in their prime during this concert and they show it. Buy this DVD if your an avid fan. The video quality is very good for a 1980 concert, the biggest draw back is the audio output is low.",1322006400,,352,4.115942028985507
7982638,4,B00008G7CV,"Good video (especially for the time), good sound (mine's in 5.1) but what's up with the unavailability and when it does show up it's an arm & a leg!?! I got it several years ago from this very webpage for $20-25.

The only time I ever saw this was at a midnight madness show at the drive-in in the early 1980's and I'm sure it was different than what's on the DVD. It was a long time ago but I'd almost bet money that Veteran of the Psychic wars was on it, a friend swares he remembers another Cult song that's not on the DVD (Black Blade, Joan Crawford?) as well as another Sabbath (or two). And neither of us remember ""The Marshall Plan"" conceptual video. I have also read other reviews commenting that this is different from the theaterical version (one said the Marshall plan was during the end credits). But still worth it!!

A must have (if can find )for any fan of B.O.C. or Dio era Sabbath. And lobby for a domestic release because if it had everything I remember from the drive-in I'd give it 5 stars.",1175472000,4,1010,4.282722513089006
7982639,4,B00008G7CV,"I've always been a fan of these two power house rock groups. I saw Black Sabbath twice, once with Ronny and the first time with Ozzy. Sabbath puts on a good show but Ronny (RJD) just can't fill the shoes of Ozzy...He does well on the Heaven and Hell songs though.

But the main reason I bought this DVD was for the Blue part. Blue Oyster Cult put on a great show and really gave it their all. I saw them in 79 and they rocked!...as they do on this dvd.

Makes you want to do a air guitar solo.

Note: I've notice this dvd has been said to be rare...Well, it's not as rare as some might think...I've seen it on ebay and many other sites for sale. Prices range between 9 and 20 bucks. In fact I bought mine here for like $18, so shop smart and enjoy the show.",1125360000,10,757,3.9671052631578947
7982640,4,B00008G7CV,"""Black & Blue"" is one of my favorite concerts and Ronnie James Dio one of the most oustanding singers of the world's Rock scene. I had the opportunity to saw him three times in Mexico city: first with Black Sabbath's Dehumanizer Tour in 1992, with Deep Purple's last Tour as special guest, and in a unique concert past year here in the city. The reality is that his complete domain of the stage is superior, mixtured with an authentic passionated dramatic capacity that make glorious magic performances: Yes! he's one of the big expressive figures with a big personality image on the Heavy Metal cathegory...In the Black & Blue concert, Dio and Black Sabbath joined forces with Blue Oyster Cult owed to the management of both bands. So this two band visual performance presented the following music programme:

BLACK SABBATH:
""War Pigs"", ""Neon Knights"", ""N.I.B.""/ ""Iron Man"", Tony Iommi guitar solo, ""Paranoid""/ ""Heaven And Hell""/ ""Die Young"".

BLUE OYSTER CULT:
""Dr. Music"", ""Rock & Roll Music"", ""Divine Wind""/ ""Godzilla"", Drum solo, ""Roadhouse Blues""/ ""Born To Be Wild""/ ""The Marshall PLan"" (video).

The Blue Oyster Cult part is good and interesting, over all, thinking that the best recording to date is the ""Cultosaurus Erectus"" album (1980) cause its magnificent Neo-Progressive songs (Heavy Rock + Progressive passages). It's a shame that tracks like ""Monsters"", ""Cultosaurus Erectus"" or ""Deadline"" did not appear here (that's the reason I put it 4 Stars) the unique song is the fabulous ""Divine Wind"" dedicated to the Ayatola komeini (did I write it well?) and the video of ""The Marshall Plan"" (?). So This concert is really going to let you asking for more... Good Luck!",1121472000,7,1679,5.032374100719425
