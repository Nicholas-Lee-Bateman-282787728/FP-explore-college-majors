6016545,5,B00FP1SZ1K,"In THAT WINTER, THE WIND BLOWS nearly everyone in the cast suffers from a hurt of long standing. This collective howl of pain lasts for the full run of 16 episodes. At the center of this pain is a gambler played by Jo In-sung. He was abandoned at a very young age by his mother and learned to survive only by conning others. He owes a huge sum of money to a local Mafioso with no means to repay. He will be killed if he does not. Enter a blind heiress played by Song Hye-kyo. Her brother vanished years ago and she wishes to reconnect. This brother shares the same name as the conman who determines to deceive the blind girl so as to convince her to give him the money that he so desperately needs. This girl has been inhabiting her own world of long-standing grief. From the age of six, when she went blind, she has had to rely on a manipulating secretary for the very basics of life. She trusts no one, not even the re-appearance of her long-vanished brother.

The pain that these two feel collide early on as they grow to know one another. She learns to trust him even as he slowly emerges from his shell of selfish con to fall in love. This is of course an impossible situation. The more that he succeeds in gaining her trust, the more his conscience assails him. Thus, the driving theme of the movie is the delicate balancing act that hurt must play in the vortex of gain versus the awareness that this gain can be achieved only by a painful re-appraisal of self. The conman and his mark are not the only ones who must look inward at self even as they look outward to enrich their wallets. The villain of the movie is himself conflicted. Years earlier he and the conman vied for the attention of the same woman who chose the conman over him. This woman became pregnant with the conman's child and he brutally abandoned her, causing her death in a traffic accident. Revenge then became his driving motife. A fourth hurting cast member is the secretary who raised the blind woman from the age of six. This secretary could have allowed the blind child to have an eye saving operation but chose not to do so since a blind child merely assured her of a continuing employment. Her conflict is that she grew to love her charge as a mother surrogate. The result of all these combined repressions of anger, grief, and pain cause all concerned to hide behind self-constructed walls of silence and feigned ignorance. It then becomes easier to continue in blindness and silence than to squarely confront a looming reality that cannot be denied.

The acting and scripting is first rate throughout. The blind woman as played by Song Hye-kyo often looks blankly right at the camera but her face gives nothing away. Even in moments of high drama, her tone is flat and level. The conman for his part has little of the emotional control possessed by her. His choice eventually leads him to decide when to tell the truth. Her choice is what to do after she learns the bitter truth. My only complaint relates to the last ten minutes of the final episode. It seems hurriedly shot with the resolution not fitting the thematic flow of the precedent action. I wished for a more believable ending; still THAT WINTER, THE WIND BLOWS emerges as a soul-stirring voyage into the souls of hurting people who see no way out except to continue to live in that stasis of pain. Highly recommended.",1407542400,7,3368,4.4747967479674795

6016547,5,B00FP1SZ1K,"I really wanted to watch this drama because it's Jo In Sung's first drama series in years... And every time I watch dramas with him he usually brings an intensity to his character.  He is an amazing actor and I am a huge fan.

I bought the PMP release and the quality was excellent (on my 55-in tv) and the subtitles were good.  I think if you are a fan of the main actor or main actress for this series, then it's definitely worth a watch.  I was a little upset because the ending was kind of disappointing, but overall up until the last 10 minutes of the whole series, the story was awesome!",1383782400,6,593,4.175438596491228

8617521,5,B00FP1SZ1K,"This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful love stories. There are so many things I love about this movie! I first ordered the soundtrack. The composer, Choi Seong-kwon was brilliant! I've listened to this CD over and over for 2 months now and still can't get enough of the beauty of this love story it conveys. Secondly, I loved the moving performance of Jo In-sung. It was highly powerful. You could just feel his pain of this life he was dealt and how he powered through all the tragedies to rise above his circumstances. I found that each of the characters had their own sad stories and how they were all able to grow by the relationships they all shared. It showed how our choices effect all those around us for good and bad and the long reaching effects. I loved the progression of each character into that better person from just knowing the others. This movie showed a seedier and darker side of Korea. The whole movie had a sad but beautiful feel to it. It was a work of art, like a painting that you just can't turn away from. One of the reasons I like Korean dramas is that they usually tie the endings up in a pretty bow, and this one didn't differ. Some don't like the ending for this reason, but I loved it. It could only end one of 2 ways, and I wanted the happiness and the ""and they lived happily ever after"" ending. After months of reliving these people's life through the the beautiful music, I broke down and ordered this sad but beautiful movie. I feel that this movie, for all its merits, should have cost more! If you're expecting the usual romantic Korean drama, don't buy this movie. But if you want to see and feel love at its grandest, then you won't go wrong with this poyient movie about choices and how they touch all those around us and the ripple effect over a lifetime.",1447977600,5,1804,4.356083086053412
