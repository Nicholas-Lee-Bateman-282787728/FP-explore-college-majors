2200569,4,B00075YVTE,"I felt what it means when some one has absolutely nothing!!!
By the way I wanted to punch the lazy husband! What kind of man walks around ordering others what to do and not to do and see his children suffer and see all kinds of jobs beyond his EGO!",1226188800,,248,3.98
2200570,4,B00075YVTE,"From the very first minutes of this movie you clearly understand how professionally it was made. Perfect photography and director's work! I tend to think that this is due to the producer Bruno Barreto.

There's a simple story with a few turns. You'll find a lot of Brazilian country landscapes here and meet local culture.

After viewing this film I felt a little sad because such a large and beautiful country with such good people and rich culture is so poor. This movie won't thrill you, but it will make you think and feel instead.",1208736000,12,535,4.621052631578947
2200571,2,B00075YVTE,"I am from the Northeast of Brazil and I expected a better movie.  The accent of the actor sounded fake. The are from the southeast of Brazil and did not work well on the accent. The movie as a caricatura.
Next time I will stick with ""Auto da Compadecida"". Much better.",1207785600,5,268,4.254901960784314
2200572,4,B00075YVTE,"from what I understand this wonderful little movie is based on a true story told by a family who makes us realize how important love in the family unit is, even with the normal odd disagreements which is only human.  It gives you strength to endure, courage and hope.  Loved Roberto Carlos music.",1202860800,2,296,4.566037735849057
2200573,4,B00075YVTE,"Which is more important, the journey or the destination? Romao is an illiterate and unemployed man with a wife and five kids, but he believes in destiny. ""My true destiny is on the road,"" he tells anyone who would stop him from taking his family of seven on a six-month, two thousand mile bicycle journey across the heart of Brazil to Rio de Janeiro. There, he believes, he will find work so that he can feed his family. People think he's crazy, of course, including his family. They panhandle, do odd jobs, sing songs at restaurants, meet people both evil and good, and sleep in abandoned buildings and rusted out buses. But they love each other deeply and experience many life lessons, especially the adolescent Antonio who is turning into a young man. This film, ""based upon a true story,"" won at least five festival awards, all of them deserved in my opinion. In Portuguese with English subtitles.",1169596800,35,901,4.708860759493671
2200574,4,B00075YVTE,"Apart from being a good road film (landscapes, transience etc), the lead actors have nicely portrayed the machismo that rules most latin american and asian societies. good soundtrack, imagery, and having been in brasil recently, i was taken back there, to the endless horizons, red roads and dusty bus stations.

i'd buy it if i could afford the steep price.",1136332800,9,358,4.966666666666667
2200575,5,B00075YVTE,"If you are curious about Brasil as i am, you must listen to this movie. Road trip on bicycle from Paraiba state on nordeste Brasil until Rio de Janeiro. A family looking for a better life. Great views of the Brasil countryside, and costal areas. A simple but beautiful movie, no action but the same Brasil quality.",1116892800,20,314,4.526315789473684

8044752,5,B00075YVTE,The film may be shocking to Americans but it is away of life for millions still of Brasilians. It is important to know the history and growth of this growing nation in the eyes of the world,1381190400,,189,4.135135135135135
8044753,2,B00075YVTE,"From the reviews and the storyline on the DVD cover, I was very excited to see this film.  Unfortunately, this story was drawn out and had no real direction.  The characters were boring, and nothing terribly eventful happened along the way.  It was as if a camera filmed a stubborn father's trip on a bike and documented nothing of interest.

To cheer yourself back up, watch a good film like 'The Man Who Copied' - also Brazilian and way more interesting.",1327968000,,456,4.592592592592593
8044754,5,B00075YVTE,For those who don't know Brazil or just know the tourist's Brazil a view of the North East..For those who know Brazil well many tears & smiles.,1312070400,,143,4.333333333333333
8044755,2,B00075YVTE,"There isn't much to say about this Brazalian member family, who courageously take a 2,000 mile bicycle trek to Rio de Janeiro  in hopes of finding work, food, and comfort throughout.  Seeking work is the most important aspect of the journey, and the young father insists upon a certain amount of money to support his family during the bicycle journey, which means he won't work for less and will not work for something that puts him in a less-than-manly view.

The family begs for food, takes odd jobs, and Rose (Mom) and children sing for their supper, while Romao (Dad) observes his family making it through the journey.

Their eldest boy, Antonio,  a young teen is peaking at puberty, interested in girls, learning to smoke, and comes to seek independence from the family.  We see a few incidences he encounters, but nothing memorable to keep the film interesting.

What is beautiful is the landscape they journey upon.  But, unfortunately, the journey is neither interesting, the folks along the way are not memorable, and the family characters fall flat, not someone we build the relationship with, nor do we really care deeply for.  Not sure how this garnered some awards, nor how it was selected for good filming with Foreign Film Movement.  ....Rizzo",1294790400,,1258,4.8915094339622645
8044756,3,B00075YVTE,"The movie is slow, but the family goes through a lot of unbelievable conflicts and hardships.  You would think that the ending would be spectacular after all is said and done, but its one of those that leaves your imagination to do the rest.....  Watch if you like this director's stuff",1256256000,,286,4.588235294117647
8044757,5,B00075YVTE,"Bus, car, train, plane is normal in traveling long distances, but imagine a entire family riding bicycles from Northeast of Brazil to get to Rio de Janeiro city(Southeast), it's about 3.500km!!!The only reason for this crazy and unique experience is the hope of finding a job of 1.000,00 reais (equivalente to $500 dollars).  They'll face hunger,violence and scorching days...Thrilling and valuable movie...",1242950400,4,407,5.564516129032258
