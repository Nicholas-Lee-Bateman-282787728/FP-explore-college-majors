8522009,5,B007USWCR4,"Excellent, engrossing films, masterfully presented in crisp, clean renditions. Amazing films, actually, when you consider they were somehow made during the Nazi occupation.",1438560000,4,172,6.521739130434782
8522010,5,B007USWCR4,"During the occupation most of the french directors made entertainment films so as to avoid trouble with the german propaganda. But Gremillon chose contemporary themes, lumiere d'ete is reminiscent of La regle du jeu for example that became forbidden. The screen-play is complex, but also entertaining. Striking is the different background music and background noise just as the camerawork. The booklets of the edition have a lot of useful information.",1346457600,21,451,5.457142857142857
8522011,5,B007USWCR4,"I made my way through this set over the weekend, and it is hands down my favorite Eclipse release. I'm blown away at the consistency of greatness in these three films. I may be wrong, but it seems that ""Remorques"" and ""Lumiere d'ete"" are more acclaimed than ""Le ciel est a vous,"" but even the latter film rose to greatness. The ""inspirational"" (and potentially lighter) storyline is there, but it feels so rooted in reality and Charles Vanel is so convincing in his love for his wife, that I completely bought into it. I love the line after they discuss the dangers of flying and Therese says that she wants to go for the world record...Vanel says something like,"" To say yes or no: which would be a greater demonstration of my love?"" He's so torn, wanting to protect her AND allow her to do anything she wants.  I was also surprised by ""Lumiere d'ete"" and the dark path it traveled. I think it was mentioned in the liner notes, but this film makes a great companion to ""Rules of the Game,"" as it touches on some of the same themes and follows a similar trajectory towards its bleak ending. These were the first Grmillon films that I've seen, and I can now join in the chorus of, ""We need more Grmillon on DVD/blu!"" I could go on and on about these films; I would call all three of them ""masterpieces.""",1346198400,26,1302,4.402489626556017
