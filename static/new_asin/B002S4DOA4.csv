3978119,4,B002S4DOA4,please note that it cannot be 100 minutes long because i looked up one of the volumes (not on amazon.com) and it was 125 minutes long,1260748800,4,133,4.153846153846154
3978120,5,B002S4DOA4,"first of all, I'm a HUGE fan of the series i have all 16 box sets of the original and the 2 single dvds of Naruto Shippuden that have come out as well (i have the other 2 on pre-order).  I never thought i would like an anime as much as i liked the dragonball series but in my opinion; naruto, pound for pound is a better anime.  i say this because the stories in my opinion are better written, and just the amount of detail put into the show in its entirety is really impressive.  Don't get me wrong, the original naruto series did drag for quite a while, but the shippuden continuation is amazing, ive watched all the episodes in japanese all the way up to episode 135 and have read up to the 471st volume of the manga and the whole premise of the show and the action thats coming up just gets better and better.  in my opinion the show is much better in Japanese but i do enjoy watching the English dubbed as well.  the box set is definitely worth the buy, it kinda stinks because it stops just short of the battle between sakura, and elder chiyo vs. sasori which was quite good.  hopefully the box sets will come out like the original series which was like one a month but i doubt it.  Oh and if you guys want to watch naruto shippuden online go to [...], its a great site they have hd episodes, you can watch all of the movies and read the manga as well.",1258416000,4,1358,4.10188679245283
3978121,5,B002S4DOA4,"Surprised that with individual Shippuden Vol1 and Vol2 just out and Vol3 at the end of the month (Nov '09) its nice to see a 3 volume box set for release 2 months later in January '10. I thought we'd all have to wait a lot longer for a slightly more economical way to get our Naruto fix. With the original Naruto seems like they released all the individual DVD before they started on the 3 DVD boxes..I'm happy to see this box set for Shippuden so quickly. I'd fully expect this be exactly what you get in the individual volumes DVD wise - perhaps lacking some inserts with the individual DVD releases. So I'd fully expect the same English dub and Japanese w/English subs.

Oh yes..review:Naruto is one of the best anime and Shippuden continues the story line 2.5 years (in Naruto time) after the final of the 50 or so enjoyable, but mostly filler Naruto episodes. Watch it.",1257724800,3,874,4.4625
3978122,4,B002S4DOA4,"Though the information provided for this box set is sketchy at least, and unless the distribution company intends to ration content as it has been for American audiences of this series, then I'll say that it's arguably reasonable to assume that this will get the same treatment as the prior American box set releases.  Generally, American seasons for shows number between 13-24, and since the other Naruto box set releases number in the teens and run approximately 325 minutes, it's safe to say that the distribution company won't plan to indulge us by giving any more than what they have been selling.

  Having said that, THIS IS IT!!!  This what us hardcore AND casual fans have been waiting for! Now as far as I go, I'm a casual fan and was introduced to this series through cartoon network, but I ignored it for some time because it aired along with the lightweight daytime programming geared to the kiddies.  Once I gave it a chance, and maybe two because it started slow, I soon gave it my full attention and total immersion.  Hearing that the story continues in another series arc versus the notorious bulk drone-episodes after the Naruto and Sasuke battle has concluded, spawned such worry: When will it be released? Will it be dubbed? Will they have the same voice actors? and if you've cheated and have seen a few of the free subtitled episodes on the net, Will the content be maintained?

  Shippunden is the true continuation of the Naruto mythos, the characters have aged and progressed in ability and the story grows darker.  For those who are still hanging on until this box set arrives in late January, allow me to ease your worries:

  -Yes, it dubbed n English
  -Yes, they utilize the same vocal talents (though I'm not sure of all characters) and they've even changed ever so slightly to denote their age
  difference.

  However, there are some worries for the fanheads, but I'm sure that you know already:

  -Though due to the content, I'm sure quite a few of you doubt that Cartoon network will ever bring it back to their normal schedule therefore editing it to death...eh, don't doubt it, so far the colorful and gratuitous profanity beloved in the original Japanese dialogue has been rewritten for virgin ears as if it does plan to return to cartoon network, possibly for adult swim because I do believe they use the words ""hell"" and ""ass""...I know...but I'm not an expert and this opinion is based on the first four episodes of the show.  So don't forget to tilt your head like a suspicious puppy when you see the word 'Uncut' in chunky-font under the title.

  Other than that ladies and gentlmen, enjoy this with those who can't stomach subtitles and prepare to re-engage in the story, this series starts off with a satisfying bang and is worth experiencing in bulk!",1256342400,47,2797,4.711340206185567
3978123,5,B002S4DOA4,"Obviously there needs to be better info on this product before many fans will buy it, I'm we'll learn more as it gets closer to its release.  First off, being as Naruto Shippuden is already being dubbed in English and that the this new Box cover is in English, I would bet this will have both language dubs.  Second, the single disc sets have 4 episodes on them with an approximate runtime of 100 minutes.  This Box set comes with 3 discs and is also listed with a runtime of 100 minutes.  I would assume this is not true, or is just talking about one of the included discs.  Nevertheless, I'm really excited to see Naruto Shippuden Box Sets this early.  Usually you don't see box sets for a long time and have to deal with the single disc volumes which can be expensive.  I'm sure the info everyone is looking for will arrive soon.",1255564800,5,832,4.329032258064516

3978125,3,B002S4DOA4,I gave it a 3 star because it is listed a only being in Japanese with English subtitles.  Is it Dubbed and the listing is wrong? Also how many episodes is in the box set. Amazon please make the listing more clear.  I can't see why it is not dubbed and the minutes say 100 mins but the other Naruto box sets were 375 minutes that is almost 4 times as long. Is this listing correct?,1255392000,2,380,3.986842105263158

3978167,5,B002S4DOA4,"This is the sequel to the original series ""Naruto"", if you've yet to see that go watch that first(or at least up until the filler starts i think the last 50ish episodes were filler if i remember right, you can google it yourself). This is the first part to the ever so much more epic adventures of Naruto! Amazing show, there is so much more action and development in shippuden than the prequel. The animation is defintally concecutivly bestter quality throughout and the fights are always very well done for the most part, the music is also quite in my tastes. If your a Naruto fan this should be a must have! especially with the manga set to end this November(assuming nothing changes from the time of me writing this)",1412640000,2,720,4.546153846153846

3978170,5,B002S4DOA4,"The animation and action are great, but what makes this an amazing manga and show is the story. Each character's story, unique and strong personality, relationships with each other, and the underlying values and morals make it a treasure. I hope it gains the immortality it deserves.",1409184000,,283,5.042553191489362
3978171,2,B002S4DOA4,"This show is terrible. I have seen the first 2 sets (26 episodes) and it could easily be condensed down to 10 episodes at most.
Frequent flashbacks to earlier in the episode, reiterating what we already know (sometimes same flashback 2-3x in an episode) flashbacks to the original Naruto just randomly thrown in to make fights take longer.

Characters come across as borderline mentally disabled needing every little thing explained to them. ""Extraction of ________ from ____ is underway!""  ""Extraction? What do you mean!""  *proceed with remaining 10 minutes of episode on a dissertation on what the term ""extraction"" means. I dozed off a couple of times when they characters would have these delightful exchanges (I'm not embellishing, I did fall asleep only to wake up to end music, rewound and found nothing was missed).

The fights NEVER end, bad guys won't die and ALWAYS have ""One more ace up my sleeve"" even when they thought that in their OWN heads (not a bluff to good guys) 3-4 moves ago.

I've looked online and this is all defended bc ""oh well they made it this way so they wouldn't have to make filler!"" Seeing that the shows a good 300+ episodes I don't think this would be a problem and there's certainly more interesting ways to pad the show.

I've watched DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Bleach..etc and Naruto Shippuden comes across as a parody of all the anime tropes made by someone who hates anime with a passion. They somehow made fights with interesting characters and powers dreadfully boring.

Save yourself the money but more importantly the TIME. I can not stress how little transpires in each 13 episode set I've seen or how infuriatingly stupid the cast of characters is. I enjoyed the thought put into the universe and have checked out some of the games on PS3 and found them to be enjoyable ways to get the story and interact with the characters.

I will not be buying Shippuden uncut box set 3...or 6...or 12...or 18 (look it up. this series goes on).

I wanted to like this show. I really did. Wasn't terribly impressed with box set 1 but gave it a 2nd chance. Regret doing so.

Oh and the punchline? Everything past opening moments of Episode 1 (up until ep 26 that I've seen) of Shippuden IS a flashback! Show opens with them closing in on Sasuke...only to rewind....days? weeks? months? I dunno. But once I realized this I laughed so hard. Shippuden is a flashback with flashbacks and flashbacks.

Found myself fast forwarding even through the fights bc they pad the hell out of everything. Gave 2 stars bc again, promise with the characters and the overall universe made. Horrible, horrible execution.",1406764800,,2626,4.724288840262582

3978175,5,B002S4DOA4,"I bought this edition at Best Buy for $11. Thinking I was getting a good deal. Amazon is really an amazing site, what site do you know that lets you critisize the item you are buying and lets you publisize where to go to get it cheaper? Yes Amazon does offer places to buy an item cheaper, but I recommend three things that I have found:

1) Buying used is a bad idea. The reason is the seller will tell you thing about the product and the next thing you know, it is usially not as it was pubicized. I bought Naruto box number 12, it was advertised in good shape; but when the product arrived there was dirt in the box and discs had scratches and did not play well. So when you buy a product from Amozon from a third party, if you do not like it for what ever reason and want to return it, then you pay for the shipping costs.

2) Their customer service is really spectackler. On returns, replacing the item, contacting the seller, contacting you with a confirmation e-mail and talking to you respectfully. Honestly is does not always happen, but most of the time is does.

3) They're return policy is amazing; items lost in shipping to you and getting results through customer service is aways incredible. There is no other place on this planet where you can open up a DVD or CD and either get a full refund or a replacement, with proper cause.

This volume expands Narutos teachings, he is more refined as a Ninja and a person as a whole.. Through the years of walking the land with his mentor he has grown both emotionally, his skill sets have improved and he is much taller.

A master Ninja (Jiraiya or also known as the perverted sage) takes Naruto under his wing and they spend two half years together, training and walking the land. He is streghthening his skills and preparing him to stand up to Akatsuki, who no allegiance to any village, let alone anyone. The Aksuki want only world domination and feel the best way too doing it is by obtaining  the nine demons
of the land; one of those demons reside in Naruto, the nine tail fox.

With volumes one through five we are introduced to Naruto, we are shown a character who was orphaned at birth and struggles to be a part of society and not ostricized from it. We are shown a character who struggles to work with others, but dreams of being the
fifth Hoekaggi (the top Ninja) of the hidden Leaf village. Even though he is possed by the nine tail fox, he learns to control his demon. Along the way in volumes one through five you will meet the characters that make up his new found family, that will stand by him in time of need or citisize him when he is at fault.

But Naruto Shippuden expands Narutos world dramaticly. You will get to learn more about why he is the keeper of the nine tail fox, about his parents, about the five great ninja natiions, about the close bond he shares with his fellow Leaf village ninjas and the various  ninjas that make up Aksuki.

I plan on collecting the whole series no matter how big a hole is burned in my wallet. The great thing is Amazon is not the only company the sells Naruto titles. You have Best Buy, Walmart, CD universe, Family video that you can buy from. Alot of the volumes sell for $40, so why buy them on Amazon when you can go to the various sites mention for half off or at much lower price.

I am a huge fan of the series, I do not like the term collector. A collector tends to be someone who collects rare item, shows them off and then resells them for a profit. Where a fan enjoys a subject. He or she may collect that item, but enjoys sharing the subject matter with others getting their opinion and insight.",1403222400,,3625,4.292825768667643

This picks up where Naruto left off with Naruto leaving with Jiraiya to train, at age 16 he returns taller and cute as hell, still the same joker etc. Older Gaara is so cool he's very mature and kind and makes friends with Naruto and also becomes a Kazekage. Sakura who was always made to look whiney hate that is more mature and finally has a strong female role she develops some kick butt powers training with Tsunade and becomes a medical ninja healer. Sasuke is still MIA Naruto is still just as hell bent on bringing him back. Sweet shy Hinata trained with Neji and has evolved into a very strong ninja who is a lot more like him now

My friend rented episode 329 of the Shippuden series it is epic Naruto meets his father the fourth hokage [ Minato Namikaze, and mother Kushina Uzumake ] both of whom had great powers, and you get to see why he grew up without parents it is an amazing addition to the series. The Kyuubi inside his body we learn the fox's name is Kurama he and Naruto exchange wisecracks but what is a big surprise they make friends, there is a battle with tailed beasts Naruto, and Kurama merge to do combat with other beasts. love that.

3978190,5,B002S4DOA4,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

were younger it was a much happier time now it is a little bit darker

3978205,5,B002S4DOA4,One of the best anime out there in my honest opinion. The ability of the writer to bring the characters emotion to life is amazing. Fight scenes are animated very well. Only negative thing as with most anime series the fights tend to drag out a little. Picture could stand to be a little more crisp but you get what you get for not getting blue ray.

3978225,1,B002S4DOA4,"The fact that you charge $30 for 13 episodes is a joke.  The only reason anyone buys this is because you put up an even more ridiculous list price of $50+ depending on what site you look at.  Look at other box sets for other shows and you'll see a vast chasm in price per episode.  On your own site you are selling dvd's of the old pokemon series at around $1 an episode while this is listed at almost $4 per episode.  Big deal if you put it on sale for $3 or $2.50 per episode.
  The fact remains that these episodes are easily watched for free all over the place online.  The only reason I go out of my way to try and buy dvd's and the like is to support the people who make the shows I like so I can see more of them.  That and the convenience of dvd's.  To be honest the only way I can explain this bad treatment of your fans is to guess that the level of pirating things like this for online downloads has really hurt your bottom line.  But I find it hard to sympathize when your answer to this problem is to screw over your honest fans who do things legally and buy from you.  The truth of the matter is it's ripoff's like this that lead people to downloading and stealing the shows.
  I won't be buying these sets of dvd's and I'm hoping sometime in the near future you come to your senses and offer them in a package that is at least ""fairly"" priced.  Until then I hope your bottom line looks a lot worse and that maybe it will give you a wake up call.  The truth of the matter is why spend $30 on 13 episodes of a show I like, when I can go out and get anywhere from 25-32 episodes for the same price when buying DBZ, case closed, or a myriad of other shows.

3978239,3,B002S4DOA4,"Naruto Shippuden Box Set 1 Season One: Original & Uncut is a three DVD set that contains the first thirteen episodes of Naruto Shippuden.  The first two discs contain four episodes and extras, while the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The beginning of Naruto Shippuden takes place two-and-a-half years after the end of the first Naruto series.  We see Naruto return to the Hidden Leaf Village, and he and Sakura are tested against their former teacher, Kakashi, to see how much they have progressed in their training during the past two-and-a-half years.  We also learn that Gaara has become the Kazekage (the leader) of the Hidden Sand Village, and we see him kidnapped by the Akatsuki organization.

The first disc has three extras included.  The first is a set of trailers, which start automatically when you select the trailers option.  The trailers included on this disc are for Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Shippuden: The Movie, Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Council 4, and Bleach the Movie 2: The Diamond Dust Rebellion.  The second feature is listed as ""New From Viz Media.""  The link takes you to three pages of advertisements: one page for Shonen Jump, one page for Naruto, and one page for other Shonen Jump titles.  The third link is ""Online Features""; all this contains is a screen that shows where to purchase Viz Media titles online.

The second disc also has three extras.  The first one is ""Trailers,"" and it includes the exact same trailers that are included on the first disc.  ""New From Viz Media"" is the same, except that it uses different pictures.  The ""Online Features"" screen included on this disc is the exact same as what appears on disc one.

The third disc has seven extras.  The first is ""Trailers""; included in this batch are trailers for Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Council 4, Naruto Shippuden: Legend Akatsuki Rising, Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Shippuden: The Movie, and Bleach the Movie 2: The Diamond Dust Rebellion.  ""New From Viz Media"" is the same as on the previous two discs, but it uses different pictures.  ""Online Features"" is exactly the same as what appeared on the first two discs.  ""Voice Actor Featurette: Return of a Ninja"" is a fourteen-and-a half minute documentary that includes interviews with some of the English dub actors and the ADR Director.  The documentary talks about the change in tone between Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, and the voice actors talk about how their characters have changed and evolved from the first series.  ""Relationship Chart: Team Kakashi"" has the user select an image to see how the characters on the team connect.  Included in this feature are Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi.  ""Production Art"" has fifteen screens of production sketches of the characters.  The final extra is ""English Credits,"" where you can see the credits for the English dub.

On the one hand, I have to give Viz Media credit for trying to go to a little more effort with the extras on this set when compared to the Naruto Uncut box sets.  However, I really don't understand why they decided to include extras on all three discs, especially since a lot of the extras are the same between discs.  Also, I'm at a loss as to why more extras were included on the disc with five episodes, instead of trying to spread out the extras a little more between the three discs and cutting down on the overlap.

As for the series itself, I thoroughly enjoyed the episodes I saw on this disc.  I especially liked being able to see the changes and growth the characters have gone through since the end of the first series.  Naruto Shippuden is definitely off to a good start, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.  I would definitely recommend this DVD box set to anyone who is already familiar with and enjoys the original Naruto series.

Contains episodes 1 to 13.
There is a good variety of episodes included here. Strong fights (Deidara VS Gaara) are mixed with a good amount of humor (the first meeting of Sakura and Naruto, Kakashi getting his welcome gift from Naruto...).
It's a strong entry for one of the (if not THE) strongest animes out there today.

I've always been a fan of the english dub (maybe it's because english isn't my mothertongue and I always liked the sound of the language itself). And in my opinion they did a great job in this episodes aswell (as always). It's just to bad, that viz takes it's sweet time releasing this boxes. But quality needs time I guess...
Viz is hanging to it's sweet traditon, established in the Bleach and Death Note box sets: in a ""Voice Actor Featurette"" the voices of team Kakashi and Tsunade show their faces and talk about the show and the dubbing behind it. For fans of the great dubbing of viz this is a nice feature.

The box comes with three single DVD-cases with very nice drawn covers of different characters.

The Naruto-Minininja included in the special edition is funny looking and a joy for every die-hard fan (but probably only for those).

Overall: A must-have for Narutofans. Upcoming fans should watch the original Naruto series first, otherwise you won't get what's happening here.

Can't wait for the next box, keep it up viz!",1275436800,3,1607,4.701067615658363

3978257,5,B002S4DOA4,"Since 1999, ""Naruto"" created by Masashi Kishimoto (""Karakuri"") has been one of the most popular anime and manga series in Japan  and has easily become a favorite best selling anime/manga series among fans all over the world.

For the anime series, since 2002, ""Naruto"" lasted until 2007 with a total of 220 episodes. The series would follow the adventures of a boy named Naruto Uzamaki, who may not be the brightest ninja from the Konoha Village but he makes it up with heart and also tremendous power as the killer beast known as the nine-tailed fox has been sealed within him.

Earlier in the series, the anime series focused on Naruto and his team members Sasuke Uchida and Sakura Haruno as they would go on adventures and learn to become a team and also honing their ninja abilities. The series would then begin to introduce other young ninjas from the village who Naruto would be paired up with and the young ninjas would take on rival clans to helping people in need. But somehow as the series continued, Sasuke Uchida would then go off on his own personal mission to stop his brother Itaki Uchida, who murdered the whole Uchida clan and his family, only leaving Sasuke alive.

Within those six years, we have seen Naruto and his friends grow as friends and also in their abilities. For Naruto, all he has wanted is to become the next Hokage (the leader of the village) when he grows older and to help his friends accomplish missions. He knows that to be a good leader, he will need to get stronger so he can protect the village once he grows older. Of course, there is so much involved in the ""Naruto"" anime series and what makes its special is its humor, its action but also how well the series integrates so many characters but yet features a good number of character driven episodes that makes the viewer appreciate many of the characters in the series.

""Naruto"", the first series ended with the young ninja leaving to train with Jiraiya for two-and-a-half years.

Here we are now with ""Naruto Shippuden"" (Naruto: Hurrican Chronicles), a sequel to the ""Naruto"" series which began a month after the first series ended in Feb. 2007 and as of Feb. 25, 2010, ""Naruto Shippuden"" aired its 149th episode in Japan. The series has been streaming through [...] a week after its airing in Japan with English subtitles but for fans who have wanted the English dub, the series began airing on Disney's XD channel. The series has been released in individual volumes (with a total of four episodes) courtesy of Shonen Jump Home Video ala Viz Media and also the first 13 episodes in a box set featuring the original episodes, uncut.

In the sequel, Naruto arrives after his training and now he's a little older, taller but still is the same naive and energetic kid that he was when he left. Many things have changed since Naruto has left. Sasuke is still gone. Sakura has been training under current Hokage Lady Tsunade, while in the sand village, Gaara has succeeded his father as Sunagakure's Kazekage (the leader of the village).

This time the threat to the ninja clans are the Akatsuki, a criminal organization which includes powerful ninjas who defected from their villages and a group which include Sasuke's brother Itachi. At this current time, not much is known of what the Akatsuki are planning but the ninja clans are all under alert trying to figure out what their next move will be.

Here is a brief spoilerless summary of the episodes included on three DVD's:

DISC 1:

  * EPISODE 1 - Homecoming - Naruto arrives after his two and half year training with Jiraiya and learns of how things have changed a bit in the village.
  * EPISODE 2 - The Akatsuki Makes Its Move - The criminal organization Akatsuki makes its move against the Sand Ninja. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sakura must go against their sensei Kakashi in redoing one of their earlier test trials.
  * EPISODE 3 - The Results of Training - Kakashi learns how far Sakura and Naruto have become. Meanwhile, a traitor is revealed from the Sand Village.
  * EPISODE 4 - The Jinchuriki of the Sand - The conclusion to Naruto and Sakura's test. Meanwhile, Gaara takes on Akatsuki's Deidara.

DISC 2:

  * EPISODE 5 - The Kazekage Stands Tall - Gaara vs. Deidara above the Sand Village.
  * EPISODE 6 - Mission Cleared - Deidara unleashes a bomb on the village, can Gaara protect the village.
  * EPISODE 7 - Run, Kankuro - Deidara and Sasori capture Gaara and Kankuro goes after them.
  * EPISODE 8 - Team Kakashi, Deployed - Sanade sends Team Kakashi to aid the Sand Village.

DISC 3:

  * EPISODE 9 - The Jinchuriki's Tear - Baki of the Sand Village goes to the village elder's for their help.
  * EPISODE 10 - Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons - The Akatsuki begin to extract the One-Tailed Shukaku from Gara.
  * EPISODE 11 - The Medical Ninja's Student - Team Kakashi arrives at the Sand Village and immediately, Sakura must do all she can to save Kankuro.
  * EPISODE 12 - The Retired Granny's Determination - Team Kakashi and Granny Chiyo goes to find the Akatsuki hideout.
  * EPISODE 13 - A Meeting With Destiny - Team Guy vs. Kisame and Team Kakashi vs. Itachi.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

One thing I noticed when it came to ""Naruto"" is that the series has had its share of well-animated and well-painted artistic backgrounds but then for some of the filler episodes, has had a decrease in quality. Fortunately, ""Naruto Shippuden"" looks awesome. I really like how the characters look much older and the emotions on the character's faces to the action that takes place in the Leaf and Sand Village is pretty cool. For the most part, with the four episodes that I've watched, Studio Pierrot has done a pretty solid job with ""Naruto Shippuden"".

AUDIO & VIDEO:

As for the audio, audio is pretty much Stereo Bilingual (Japanese and English). Similar to a series like ""Dragon Ball Z"", with ""Naruto"", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series. It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well. But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done. Since the series is front channel driven, for those with a modern home theater receiver probably will enjoy a more immersive soundscape by selecting stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 1 - Season One: Original & Uncut"" comes with the following special features:

  * Voice Actor Featurette: Return of a Ninja - (14:35) A featurette with the ADR Director and voice talent of ""Naruto Shippuden"" as they talk about the series and what they enjoy about working on the series.
  * Relationship Chart: Team Kakashi - A text based feature showing the relationship of Team Kakashi: Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura.
  * Production Art - Using your remote, you can view 15 production art images.
  * Viz Media Trailers - Trailers for upcoming or current Viz Media releases.

EXTRAS:

""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 1 - Season One: Original & Uncut"" comes with a slip case.  It's important to note that the limited edition box set contains a mini ninja Naruto and an exclusive art card.

JUDGMENT CALL:

What a wonderful start for ""Naruto Shippuden"". So, many fans who have been watching the anime series since its release back in 2002 have grown with this series and watched every episode continuously for so many years and now, here we are with the sequel that is full of action and for the most part, seeing how these characters progressed as a ninja and also have grown older in terms of the way they look. As usual, there is a lot of action but there is a lot of humor in the series and to see him and Sakura together especially taking on Kakashi-sensei was so hilarious.

These uncut episodes do include the commercial bumpers in the beginning and end and also includes the short animated sequence which features the characters in super-deformed format or features a character teaching the viewer something about their village or special ability.

""Naruto Shippuden"" is a great anime series and this first volume is definitely a great start for the sequel. But if you are planning to watch the series from beginning to end, you definitely will want to purchase the ""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 1 - Season One: Original & Uncut"" DVD box set vs. per volume for the better value and you get the first 13 episodes.

But overall, I'm really enjoying the series and seeing how much action is involved in the first 13 episodes and also seeing the other members of the Leaf Village again and them battling the Akatsuki.  So, far the series have been enjoyable, action-packed and thrilling.  ""Naruto"" fans, this DVD box set is definitely recommended!",1269302400,8,8695,4.676973684210527
3978258,5,B002S4DOA4,"This is the box set all the true Naruto fans have been waiting for! Amazon.com has the run time incorrectly listed as ""100 minutes."" Unfortunately that was a major deterrent for me.  It wasn't until I learned that the set's true running time is 325 minutes that I was able to warrant a purchase.  This is just like the uncut box sets that were released for the first arc of Naruto (volumes 1-16). Naruto Shippuden Box Set 1 contains 3 discs for a total of 13 episodes.

Shippuden brings us back to the main story line of Naruto.  Picking up with Naruto returning to Konohagakure (The village hidden within the leaves) approximately 2 years after he left to receive training from the Great Toad Sage Jiraiya; Shippuden does not disappoint.  It quickly sets a darker tone, and displays much character depth.  There is a new found sense of urgency as the Akatsuki is actively on the move.  I don't wish to reveal any spoilers so I'll just say this box set is definitely worth the purchase.  If you are a Naruto fan, this is the logical next step in the progression of the series, and therefore worth every cent. They even managed to include an interesting bonus feature that contains brief interviews with some of the English voice actors as well as the director.

Naruto is definitely my favorite cartoon, it will be a sad day when the series finally reaches a conclusion.",1267228800,2,1370,4.604938271604938
3978259,3,B002S4DOA4,"I really enjoy Naruto and its a blast to finally see the new series hit US shores.  I didn't mind the filler episodes finishing off the original series, but they do get old after a while when the story just sits at a stand-still.  I would give the dvd set a five star rating except for one big issue.  The video quality of the transfers is very poor in my opinion. No, I did not buy a bootleg.  Its straignt from amazon.com.  I have an HD tv and I play many standard anime dvds upconverted on it but this one has very washed out colors.  It may be best to wait for the eventual blu-ray release of the series (no official word yet but I believe its coming).  I really feel they could have done a better job.  Even the old Naruto looks better than this in terms of color.",1265241600,,769,4.08
3978260,3,B002S4DOA4,"Hi, let me start by saying that this is my first DVD Box set of any anime in like 4 years, with that said let me state that I was expecting more from the video quality in these DVDs. The DVDs are regular DVDs (4.5 GB) the publisher could have used at least DL (double layer) DVDs and put more video quality in them. I watch Naruto Shippuden on the official site and I would say that the video quality streaming on the site is just as good as the video quality in these DVDs, I know where to get HD (720p) episodes online so why wouldn't they released the anime in better video quality?. Do not get me wrong, I love the Naruto Shippuden series and I'm glad we can finally get it in spoken English, but I was just expecting more from the video quality. So if you enjoy exceptional video quality and own an HD TV and a DB player or PS3, you will be better off waiting for the BD (blu-ray disc) release, if that ever happens. But why not, Claymore the Complete Series Box Set will be release on Blu-ray on February 16, to mention one. So hopefully in a not so distant future Naruto Shippeden will be released in BD also.",1265241600,3,1116,4.147465437788019
3978261,4,B002S4DOA4,"I'mma keep it plain and simple for everyone who reads this. The Pro's are: Good Box Art, Original & Uncut, you can throw on the Japanese audio with the English subtitles too. My only Con is: Only 13 Episodes? I thought season 1 was 52 episodes? They should've waited and not try to make a quick dollar. Besides that everything else is good...I think ppl should wait til after episode 52 is released on tv then see what happens from there, maybe they will come out with a full season 1 box, but then again this isn't Yu Yu Hakusho where 1 season worth of episodes are perfectly in one box for you to enjoy. But this is good too i guess.",1264982400,,635,4.213114754098361
3978262,5,B002S4DOA4,"I pre-ordered Shippuden after not buying any of the filler box sets. And was hoping that the 3 disc format would change with the new series, sadly it did not, and there are still 3 discs per box, but this is fine enough.

The box is styled in a new way, instead of folding out, it has slim disc cases. At first this annoyed me, but when I saw each disc has the original Japanese cover art I was very pleased (much better than the individual disc art). The options are all there, bilingual, subs and dubs. With much more interesting bonus features than any of the original series. It actually has a voice actor featurette, much to my surprise. In all, this is very satisfying, and I hope they release the next one soon, as I will buy it as well.

I suggest this to anyone who wants to see Naruto Shippuden, but doesn't want the Disney XD edited version.",1264723200,3,852,4.285714285714286
3978263,5,B002S4DOA4,"I usually don't make a point to review an item unless I feel really strongly about it. However, with this release I felt it necessary to say how impressed I was with Viz's packaging. Not only did they add in the little extras that the Japanese releases like to sneak in at the end of the credits, they also included one of the nicer VA featurettes I've seen, staring Malie Flanagan-Naruto, Kate Higgins-Sakura, Dave Whittenberg-Kashshi and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn-veteran VA and director. The chibi Naruto that was packaged with the Special Edition was very cute too... now give us a Kakashi and Itachi! OK, and besides all of that, Naruto Shippuden is a much better, more in depth and mature story than it's predecessor. Highly recommended to anyone hesitant because of the (bad) filler laden Nartuo (first series).",1264723200,2,815,4.913043478260869
3978264,4,B002S4DOA4,"I'm really happy that finally Naruto Shippuden is being released in Box Set format, and this Special Edition with the Mininja Naruto is great.

I have one issue though.

The original Naruto Box Sets were packaged in a Digipak set, where you pulled it out of the sleeve and opened it up to find the discs/inserts. This set is not like that. It's still a cardboard sleeve, but instead of the Digipak, it's 3 slim cases for each disc. A lot of people wouldn't have a problem with this, but it's just something I find irritating. Another disappointment is that no storyboard booklet is included either, sadly.

Though if these minor problems, I still find this set great, and it's easily worth a  purchase!",1264550400,,702,4.637096774193548
