2691293,2,B000KHX71M,"How can WWE release a DX DVD and only focus on the reunion? This is all recycled stuff from the last year! The entire point of the DVD division has been to showcase the extensive tape library WWE now possesses. Instead, we get something that appeals only to the people who like what they have already been watching. Wouldn't it make more sense to release a retrospective so people know why it's a big deal that DX is new and improved as the title states? This despite the fact that the ""new and improved"" DX is actually the old and tired from before.

Come on, WWE! Give us the Rick Rude and Chyna-as-a-man days when Shawn Michaels was so coked out of his head that he didn't care about Jesus! Give us the days before Triple H was ""The Game"" when he thought it was funnier to get a pay-per-view audience to question his sexuality than to squash male cheerleaders. Granted, most of the people from that old DX are either dead, fired or working for the competition, so I get that ignoring the New Age Outlaws might make good business sense.

However, it does not make for a good DVD.",1168992000,13,1081,4.373134328358209
2691294,5,B000KHX71M,"The orignal DX helped form the ""attitude"" era of the WWE.  Is this worth it the second time around though?  Alot of fans said it was immature and they should grow up. Me, I personally though its what WWE needed at the time. The wrestlers, McMahons, and the Coach giving there takes on D-X in full character mode. No comment is candid as they are just playing along, which makes this dvd seem like a movie rather then a real life wrestling dvd where you have wrestlers talk about one anther truthfully. The dvd is jammed pack with key moments and matches. The first dvd is the best with D-X impersonating the McMahons. The is probably one of the funniest moments in the history of Raw.  I forgot how funny Triple H and HBK were until I watched some moments from this dvd. Sure it doesnt seem as groundbreaking as the stuff they did in the late 90's but still funny. The dvd is well put together- as it evolves week to week showing what D-X did on Raw.  Every  match they were in as a team is presented here from Raw, ECW, and the PPVs up until Survivor Series. Really good dvd set and I highly recommend this to fans of D-X.",1168732800,3,1123,4.253521126760563
2691295,2,B000KHX71M,"If your expecting one of WWE's high quality DVD documentries such as Chris Benoit & Road Warriors or a great anthology of matches such as Hulk Hogan & Undertaker...I don't think your going to find it here.  This is just WWE once again ""milking the cow"" for all they can...like they did with the John Cena ""Word Life"" DVD years ago.  This DVD is formatted like the old ""nWo: Back In Black"" DVD where they're mainly going to focus on the recent WATERED DOWN version of the group HBK & HHH and ignore the previous history of the group (New Age Outlaws, Chyna, Rick Rude, X-Pac).  If your looking for quality wrestling that you saw from HBK on his ""From The Vault"" DVD or Triple H on his ""That Damn Good"" & ""The Game"" DVD's then again, you won't find it here as most the matches were either complete squashes with them dominating or overselling their opposition.  However, if you enjoyed the backstage skits & jokes that DX has given you for the past six months then they're all here...but they were also on other PPV DVDs such as Vengeance (which had a bonus disc almost completely dedicated to DX) and Unforgiven.  All the other stuff you've seen on RAW so you can already remember for yourself if you liked it or not.  Basically, this DVD is strickly for those die hard fans of this DX reunion.  I wouldn't recommend for anyone else since the only match worth talking about was the Hell In The Cell that you could get with the Unforgiven DVD.

I recommend the OTHER DX tape that WWE re-released onto DVD before I could recommend this one.",1168560000,7,1537,4.444839857651245

(Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

The New and Improved DX
Do you remember when WWE used to put out hour-long DVDs over a segment of a superstar's career? Some of them were great; I gave&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mick-Foley-Hard-Knocks-Cheap-Pops/dp/B000059HC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mick Foley Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops</a>&nbsp;five stars. Most of them meddled in the three star range though. The New and Improved DX is like a extended cut of those DVDs. You do not get only an hour to highlight a period of DX, but you get three slam-packed DVDs on their outing in 2006.

Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels feuded in early 2006. Vince asked Triple H to take out Shawn Michaels, but instead ended up helping Shawn. This would be a quick transition into the new D-Generation X. Shawn and Triple H would feud with the likes of Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, Big Show, and Rated RKO for the rest of 2006 and early 2007. DX was extremely different from the many other versions from the Attitude Era. This time they were more goofy and child-friendly. This is not a bad thing; it is just different.

The DVD set is pretty cool. Even the casing is creative. It has pop-up versions of Shawn and Triple H doing the suck-it signs. The DVD has nearly every single DX segment in full. One thing I loved about this set is many of the superstar's that commented on DX were low-card wrestlers. This includes Trevor Murdoch, Carlito, and Spirit Squad. This set also has tons of matches in full. Most of these matches are just Raw matches that are not very good. I prefer this rather than having a bunch of clips. Now you never have to wonder if the match is good, you know because you saw it. Some of the TV matches even allow you to see what was going on during the commercial. The only good matches are this set are the PPV matches. I will give you people a match-by-match review of the PPV matches only. Just remember that these are not the only matches on the set.

Handicap Match (Vengeance 2006)
DX VS Spirit Squad
DX put on a fantastic showing in their first PPV match back. The match is a comedy match. Vince McMahon felt that with an advantage, Spirit Squad would have no problem beating DX. He is sadly mistaken though. One member of Spirit Squad puts on a headband and does some martial arts moves. This match is all good fun.
RATING- 7.5/10

DX VS Mr. McMahon & Shane McMahon (Summerslam 2006)
Before the match even begins, DX is assaulted by Finlay, Mr. Kennedy, Regal, and Big Show. Mr. McMahon and Shane enter the ring after and take complete control. They even dish out a couple sweet double team moves. The match itself is not that great, but it has its moments.
RATING- 7/10

Hell in a Cell- Handicap Match (Unforgiven 2006) (Match of the DVD)
DX VS Mr. McMahon/Shane McMahon/Big Show
This match is just what Hell in a Cell needed. This Hell in a Cell is completely different from other Hell in a Cell matches. The match is taken seriously, but has a comedic edge to it all. All men in the match bleed except for Big Show. The ending is probably one of the most unique and appropriate endings I have ever seen.
RATING- 8.5/10

Special Referee- Eric Bischoff (Other Choices- Mr. McMahon, Coach) (Cyber Sunday 2006)
DX VS Edge & Randy Orton
Eric Bischoff had been hinting a return of nWo, which is probably why the fans chose him as the referee. Bischoff played a small role in the match until the end. The match is slow and lacks anything good about it. I expected a much better match from these four superstars.
RATING- 5/10

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match (Survivor Series 2006)
DX/Team Extreme/CM Punk VS Edge/Orton/Nitro/Helms/Knox
CM Punk steals DX's spotlight before and during the match. The crowd is hot for him. Knox is eliminated seconds into the match. There is so decent action during the match, but a huge problem comes in the result. I try not to give away the finish to a match too often, but it is a key to you understanding the score. The match is a shutout. One of the teams dominated the entire match. Considering the talent in the ring, this should not have been done.
RATING- 6/10

That is the end of the matches. It is also the end of the final disk as well. This set ends with Survivor Series 2006. Even though DX only last two more months, they opted to leave those two months out. This is annoying, and frankly pointless. I wanted to give this set four stars for its great presentation and content, but it lacked the final months of DX's reunion. This three-disk set is probably good for anyone who loved DX's return in 2006. The rest of us should not even bother with The New and Improved DX. If you are looking for information on the old DX, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-D-Generation-X/dp/B000JVRFXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: D-Generation-X</a>.",1223769600,13,5241,4.737938596491228
2691345,5,B000KHX71M,"The original D-X came out when I was about 13 years old. I haved stopped watching wrestling consistantly since then and it was a real treat to see my favorite tag team back together. The DVD has some hilarious moments, good matches and is well worth the purchase. Shawn Michaels still has ""it"".",1209772800,3,294,4.566037735849057
2691346,1,B000KHX71M,"The only thing that this DVD set has, is a bunch of footage and some of the worst matches I've ever seen in the short stint that they did in 2006. The reunion of Shawn Michaels and Triple H that wish they were still in their 20's. DX wouldn't have had long term sucess if it were not for X-Pac, Chyna and the WW# tag team champions of the Wooooooooooooorld. The Road Dogg Jesse Jammes, Bad @ss Billy Gunn, the New Age Outlawz. Shawn Michaels and Triple H cannot carry DX on their own once again because of injury and this DVD set proves it. I wouldn't even consider these 2 true legends, how many wrestling companies have they wrestled for in the last 10 years? Move it around a little, it's not going to kill you by wrestling for other companies. I will consider them the 2 biggest @ss kissers in WWE history. They must be afraid to wrestle for somebody else or they just love having their destiny controlled by Vince McMahon. I bet this DVD set was released for them to make an extra dollar off of. I would only recommend this set to somebody that comes home from a hard days work and doesn't have a real life person to cheer them up. And if you ain't down with that I got 3 words for you ""don't buy it"".",1200182400,,1206,4.180257510729613

2691348,3,B000KHX71M,"The reason this dvd about the new DX of the wwe is a hit and miss is that if you are a big fan of wrestling as I am, you already own EVERYTHING on this dvd! The new DX focusses only on the reuniting of HHH and HBK last year and each and every clip they did in their fueds with the Spirit Squad, the McMahons, and Rated RKO. Sure some moments are really funny and the matches they chose are pretty much entertaining to see, do not buy this if you are a long time fan or have collected the monthly ppvs on dvd like I have for the past year beause you are pretty much spending money to get the same footage all over again.

To sum it up, everything you have seen that had to do with DX last year is in this, and there are classic moments that make it worthwhile. The box art is really cool, it is a fold out with a paper pop-up Shawn and Triple H with movable arms doing their infamous crotch chops and be prepared to be mooned by DX when you take out the discs.

2691356,5,B000KHX71M,"Out of all the new formations of DX, it's great to see it lead to simply having Shawn Michaels and Triple H(well, technically Shawn Michaels now).",1172793600,2,146,4.653846153846154
2691357,4,B000KHX71M,"Of course everyone loved the old DX, it was new, it was fresh, they could do more with more members ala Chyna, NEW AGE OUTLAWS and so on.  But Shawn and HHH have done a great job this year and quite frankly compared to a lot of the rest of the show were just so far ahead of the game (no pun intended) that they had to.  They saved the WWE this year along with Cena, Orton, Flair and Edge.

Now, my problem with this disc set is not that it only shows the last year - in fact I thought that was a good idea...my issue is that NOT ONCE do Shawn and HHH talk about their matches - We hear from Shane, Vinnie Mac, Carlito, Nitro and even the Miz but never DX themselves, nor even Flair, or RKO who were major parts of their storylines.  The other thing is that all the interviews with the exceptions of a few moments with Stone Cold and a few Nitro pieces, everyone stays in charachter.  The WWE DVD's have been great at letting us see the stars without their persona.  The Dusty Rhodes and Roddy Piper DVD's were fantabulos and the WWE should have gone down the road with those lines in mind.

Now my last issue is that I agree not all the vignette stuff is here and to me, the one that stands out the most is from the Raw prior to the survivor series.  That night, all of the survivor series teams came out one by one and did promo's and DX/HARDYZ/CM PUNK were fantastic in their verbage, also, we didn't get the matches from that RAW either.  This was the best night to me in the New and improved DX legacy...it is a shame...

To end, there are some top notch spots and matches in this DVD and it is worth purchasing.",1172275200,2,1617,4.0886075949367084
2691358,1,B000KHX71M,"Why release a DVD like this when your product is absolutly watered down? Nobody wants to see this 'new DX' on TV, never mind DVD. The only thing WWE is still good for are DVD releases...and this is NOT one of them. DX is so boring and lame and most importantly not FUNNY. Plus, all that is on the dvd is stuff from the past year. It's too early!",1172016000,10,345,4.0144927536231885
2691359,1,B000KHX71M,"Ok, one question..WHY Should I buy this.. I record RAW each week..I buy all the PPVS, so I already have all the footage....So, why should I buy this Vince? For the DX packaging? to have everything in one place so I don't have to do it myself...? I will take a pass on this one just because I already have it...",1172016000,7,310,4.098360655737705
2691360,4,B000KHX71M,"This 3 DVD pack celebrating the return of DX is OK. It shows mostly everything thats happened since Vince McMahon started the Kiss My A** Club and Triple-H and HBK's refusal's to all the way up to the Survivor Series 07.

Now, I loved watching this, it's funny and entertaining and it does have all the matches in there entirety. But unlike what another reviewer said, he's wrong, it DOES NOT feature all the little skits and bits.

Missing is the footage of Triple H finding Shawn trying to use a computer to alter there Cyber Sunday match and Hunter getting HBK so worked up that Shawn Michael's goes on a rampage delivering Sweet Chin Music to anyone standing around in the backstage area... and also the footage of DX stuffing the Spirit Squad into a box and mailing them away... I thought those two clips where hilarious, but there no where to be seen on this DVD! However there currently watchable on wwe dot com. figure that one out.

Theres probably more missing too.

I give the 3 discs 4 stars, it's OK but there is things missing. I'd give it 5 if it included what was missing and better bonus features. The Bonus features are mostly the highlight reels they show at PPV's or after them of the match, then there is some bonus footage about Edge and Orton, and finally the only extra feature worth looking at is the full version of DX in the corporate jet and then entering the wwe headquarters to make there mark in history.

There is also 1 hidden egg i found, there aren't any more, just the one. I won't tell you what it is, but its not worth watching, i can tell you that much. If you wanna find it, go to the chapter selection on the 3rd disc and press left twice on about the 3rd last one, or is that right. I dunno, it ain't worth remembering.

Be cool to have seen a continuation since the last DX video, or they should have at least added to that one being released on DVD.

anyway, thats all i got to say about this DVD and if you don't like it, you know the two words for ya.",1172016000,6,1997,4.267195767195767

2691362,5,B000KHX71M,"To the people in the previous negative reviews whining about this DVD only having the ""newer"" DX and not any of the older stuff--what did you expect? The DVD is called the New and Improved DX. Thus, it would only be logical that it includes stuff about the new DX. If you want the older stuff, buy the original DX video that was re-released on DVD by WWE last summer.

As far as THIS DVD is concerned, anybody who is a fan of the reborn DX with HHH and HBK (and judging from the amount of merchandise they've sold, that's a lot of people) should be pleased with it. It has almost everything they've done together since DX was reformed, with interview clips and full matches thrown in for good measure.",1171843200,5,701,4.351145038167939
