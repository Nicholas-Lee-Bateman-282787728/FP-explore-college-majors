2839276,3,B000QQCUMO,"Ive seen quite a bit of TUF and this season didn't do it for me, the fights (except a handful) were BORING but sayin that the season finale was seriously awesome and Im so happy they changed the rules for season 3 cause its really not fair for some fighters to fight several times like mr. evans and the previously mentioned mr. dean of mean that being said rashad still did very well and the coaching was absolutly terrible this season. It was just boring, there were no fueds and only a handfull of good fights if it was up to me i would sell the finale as a stand alone and save alot of people the trouble.",1253664000,,609,4.169491525423729
2839277,4,B000QQCUMO,"This was a great season, featured some very brutal fights and talented martial artists.  I admit I was a little dis-appointed in the beginning with some of the fighters lack of enthusiasm, but as the season wore on the fighters picked up the pace brought the kind of action we have come to expect from the UFC. I only gave it four stars because some seasons bring this kind of action from start to finish.",1239753600,,405,4.4
2839278,4,B000QQCUMO,"I really enjoyed The Ultimate Fighter,Season 2. It was very interesting seeing how the guys lived and trained in order to obtain a 6 figure contract with the UFC.",1227398400,,162,4.620689655172414
2839279,5,B000QQCUMO,"If you're a fan of the UFC.. I highly recommend getting it.

I wish they had an option on the CD's to watch the TV version.  I have kids that like to watch this too, but with all the swearing I will not allow them to watch it till they get older.",1227225600,,246,3.7115384615384617
2839280,5,B000QQCUMO,"Another great season of TUF. Matt Hughes is quite a dick in the season, but he did the things he needed to when it counted.  Not trying to spoil anything, but TUF was a nice underdog story. Oh yeah, never judge a book by its cover",1226880000,,230,4.0
2839281,5,B000QQCUMO,"Dana White and co did it again. Love this show, it's really addictive. This is even better than the first season in my humble oppinion. We get to see Matt Hughes in a complete new light, man he's a tough coach! Buy this if your even remotely interested.",1208736000,,253,4.291666666666667
2839282,5,B000QQCUMO,"There was a LOT of good talent on season two of The Ultimate Fighter. And, I'll admit it, this is what got me into mma and the UFC in particular. They had some great personalities (Joe Stevenson, Luke Cummo), some great coaching (Matt Hughes, Rich Franklin), and some great fights. With fighters like Keith Jardine, Rashad Evans, Josh Burkman, and Marcus Davis (among others) it's worth watching this season in large part because you'll find more significance in what's going on in the UFC today. And besides that, the show was just more entertaining back then. When it aired, I looked forward to it every week and was never disappointed.",1193184000,8,638,4.8090909090909095
2839283,5,B000QQCUMO,This was an excellent season of The Ultimate Fighter.  I like this one better than most because the talent level of everyone on the show was astounding. I missed this season when it originally aired so it was great to see all the MMA personalities before seeing them fight in the UFC>,1192838400,2,284,4.461538461538462
2839284,5,B000QQCUMO,"I had seen this season on tv, but found it extremely difficult to find on dvd.  Everything was excellent, being uncensored always makes things better too.  Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the UFC or The Ultimate Fighter.  Thanks Amazon.com for coming thru with the product...",1192838400,2,285,4.775510204081633

8196850,5,B000QQCUMO,"This is when the UF was very raw. The coaches didn't fight and the fighters/coaches did things that on todays UF would get you sued.
This season had an all star cast. The one guy that stuck out was Jorge Gurgel (he was also Rich Franklin's coach at the time in real life) he couldve been a champ but the stuff he goes through w/his knee and still keeps fighting is stuff of legend.",1392422400,,381,4.162162162162162
8196851,5,B000QQCUMO,I love the UFC. I had bought the first Season and I wasn't even done with it and I needed more!,1363564800,,95,3.5714285714285716
8196852,4,B000QQCUMO,"This season was good, but was kinda lackluster if compared to the first season, but still a good season. This is the last season to have the challenges, this time the challenges were designed by Randy Couture. The show saw the birth of one of the best UFC stars for the next years in Rashad Evans, who competed as heavyweight in this season, and also, this season gave him the bad reputation he still has with a lot of MMA fans, by showboating on some of his fights (which got in the nerves of Matt Hughes) and giving some boring fights during this season, but also, like Dana White said, he underestimated him for most of the season, not giving Rashad the credit he deserved as a fighter. Also, the show had good fighters like former No. 1 lightweight contender Joe Stevenson and Keith Jardine, to mention a few. It has less memorable moments than other seasons, like Melvin Guillard pranking Dana White in one of the funniest moments in TUF history.

There was no drama between the coaches this season, as Matt Hughes and Rich Franklin were good friends plus they fought in different weight divisions, however, Hughes still managed to got some attention when he confronted Rashad Evans for his showboating and not caring at all for one of his fighters (Jason von Flue) even when he won a fight, and also playing mind games with Franklin's first pick Jorge Gurgel. Plus 3 fighters were out of the show before even fighting, as Kenny Stevens quitted when he was overweight and didn't want to cut 5 pounds more, Eli Joslin walked out of the show since he couldn't handle the camera enviroment and Kerry Schall got injured on the first training sessions.",1353888000,,1652,4.619047619047619
8196853,5,B000QQCUMO,"This DVD's contains another season of the hit TV show Ultimate Fighter.  As a side note, this DVD is NOT suitable for children under the age of 17!  My son's 17 and he's not permitted to watch any of the Ultimate Fighter DVD sets.  You won't be disappointed in season two with more knockouts, submissions and TKO's than before.  Although the two coaches don't hate each other they're highly competitive.  This DVD set is a blast to watch just be careful who's around and listening to the language.",1333411200,,497,4.6022727272727275
8196854,5,B000QQCUMO,"Being an ultimate fighter and mma fan, I enjoyed watching the uncensored version of the show on DVD. Great buy and great price. (One of the suggested tag word options for this DVD rating is homoerotic... lol)",1289001600,,208,4.648648648648648

He's a guy, they can watch fights over & over & over, it doesn't get old.  I purchased season 1 thru 4 & will be getting the rest, very soon!",1271289600,,266,4.115384615384615
