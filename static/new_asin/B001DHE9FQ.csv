3529559,2,B001DHE9FQ,"Alas, my five year old daughter has outgrown the Partridge Family before the release of season three.",1219708800,,101,5.0
3529560,5,B001DHE9FQ,"IT'S ABOUT F'N TIME!!!!!!!  I still have all the VHS tapes from Columbia House and those cheap VHS slow speed tapes.  I thought Sony might get the idea that when you're releasing a TV series, you release it ALL.  I'm so glad they finally did release Season Three for The Partridge Family.  I hope they release the rest of the series ASAP.  As with the first two seasons and as I am planning to do with the third, I will own the balance of the series the day of release.

Thanks, SONY!",1219190400,3,484,4.206521739130435
3529561,5,B001DHE9FQ,"The Partridge Family's third season was definitely among this series' best: the characters had gelled; the plotlines were solid (and more hilarious than ever!); and the music, like its prime audience, was maturing. I LOVE this season, and this show (can you tell? LOL), and CAN HARDLY WAIT TILL ITS RELEASE THIS FALL!!! I know this is a bit belated on my part, but THANKS SONY!! And I hope all we PF fans can all look forward to the series FINAL Season in the not-too-distant future as well! Thanks again to everyone responsible for making this happen!!!",1219104000,16,554,4.721649484536083

It's been too long.

3529565,3,B001DHE9FQ,All I can say is it is about freaking time.  We waited 2 or 3 years for season 3 to finally make its way to dvd.  Sony is so slow in putting out some of their series.  I hope season 4 gets a release a lot sooner than season 3 did.  Very happy to finally get season 3.,1217808000,8,267,3.5517241379310347
3529566,5,B001DHE9FQ,This show is very 70ish but it's a lot of fun to watch. The music is also very lite pop rock. There is not much to the show however you do get a good laugh.,1504051200,,156,3.4857142857142858

3529583,5,B001DHE9FQ,"I just purchased seasons one and two, now I shall purchase this one, and hopefully later on, season 4. I was very young when the Partridge Family first came on the air, and twelve when it was cancelled. However, I loved the show, and have listened to their music off and on for years. I noticed that one of the customer reviews said that Jeremy Geldwaks was a better Chris than Brian Forster. I agree, since Brian Forster was not a very good actor. Jeremy was more believable, and also adorable!!",1448668800,,496,4.461538461538462

3529612,4,B001DHE9FQ,We have had this movie for a few years now and decided I should write a review. I bought it for my wife who loves this TV Series. We bought this movie from Amazon because at the time it was not available in Australia. Highly recommended..,1393372800,,238,4.195652173913044
3529613,4,B001DHE9FQ,I'm enjoying watching episodes of The Partridge Family! It brings to mind the more innocent time of childhood.  I like David Cassidy's voice but the creators should have allowed Shirley to sing more.,1392595200,,199,5.03030303030303
3529614,5,B001DHE9FQ,"I think movies and TV shows pretty much speak for themselves. If you are searching for this movie/show, you must be considering buying it. I purchased this for my electronic library because I did not feel the need to have the media. I am very happy with the fact that I can go to my library from my phone or tablet whenever I want to and watch this. It is also handy to be able to access it on my home theatre system you finish one and then go to the next; it avoids having to run up and down the stairs switching out DVDs .",1392336000,,524,3.952830188679245

Such a nice switch from what tv offers now days :)  I just which it would come together as a complete series like in a multi-colored bus  boxed set  :)  I would recommend this to any one with kids that wants something decent for them to watch.  My 14  yr old  just loves it  & so does her mama & dad  :),1388361600,,354,3.9285714285714284

3529618,5,B001DHE9FQ,Good family fun for the whole family.  This 70's show really should be about modern families instead of the junk they have on television today,1381363200,,142,4.68
3529619,5,B001DHE9FQ,"This old 70's sitcom has a reputation for being corny because it is clear that the children are not singing or playing instruments during the concert scenes, but the writing is humorous, and the acting is actually pretty good.  If you watched the Partridge Family every Friday night when you were young, you will enjoy seeing it again.  I did.",1378944000,2,343,4.7

3529624,5,B001DHE9FQ,"This season and the first two are my favorites. I recommend all 4 seasons, but seasons 3 and 4 are where David Cassidy really takes the spotlight. These are very entertaining shows to watch. The color and sound quality is great and these DVD's are well worth the money spent.",1368489600,2,275,4.52

3529627,4,B001DHE9FQ,"""Somethin' always happens whenever we're together,"" sings Keith Partridge (David Cassidy) in the opening theme, and truer words were never spoken.  If this third season had a theme, it would be that the Law of Unexpected Consequences is alive and well.  From Danny's (Danny Bonaduce) resolve to lose weight, which leads to a bet with manager Reuben Kincaid (Dave Madden) that he can stick to his diet longer than Reuben can lay off cigarettes, to Shirley's (Shirley Jones) off-and-on decision to sell their house and move on to something bigger, to Keith's endangering the family's summer tour because he's flunking (of all things) sex education (although to do him justice, the course he's taking is very technical, not like the kind of ""plumbing manual"" many Baby Boomers remember), to Laurie's (Susan Dey) insistence that her big brother become politically aware, which leads not only to his volunteering for her candidate but to the widowed candidate (Bert Convy) and Shirley becoming an item, to the return of Shirley's unconventional parents (Ray Bolger, Rosemary Forsyth), things always seem to lead to other things.  Yet the series also finds time to address important issues: Laurie is accused of stealing a vital math test and faces a trial before a jury of her peers, but refuses to turn in the friend who really did the deed; Danny falls to the temptation of shoplifting a yo-yo and descends into a morass of self-hate that leads him to refuse to share in the family's ""Citizen of the Year"" award.  As always, the family (even Danny, who's 12 now and discovering love) is attractive and the music clean and pleasant, and the popular series retains its momentum and its special style.",1357344000,4,1695,4.957746478873239
3529628,4,B001DHE9FQ,"Clean fun with 1970's musical family adventures and humor. My special needs adult daughter watches these endlessly, as she watched the series as a child.",1356393600,,153,5.16

3529631,5,B001DHE9FQ,"The velvet pantsuits are in more colors, David Cassidy is still making the girls swoon, and they are still my favorite television family!  Guest appearances from John Astin, Ray Bolger, a very young Jody Foster, Bert Convy, Season Hubley, and Arte Johnson add to the silly antics of the third season.  You'll see Shirley take on a department store credit computer, the Partridge family in chicken suits, Danny begin his stable of racing horses and Keith, America's heartthrob, flunking sex education!!!!  It's a wonderful trip back through a simpler time and the music will have you either singing or cringing (depending on your age).  You can never lose with the Partridges!

worth watching. I really like David Cassidy.",1277164800,,202,4.342105263157895
3529635,5,B001DHE9FQ,Bring back this kind of TV and maybe kids would be different! I love this show not just for David Cassidy but its entertaining. Many out there I know are not fans of this but at leaset it is good clean humour and the whole family can watch it unlike many of the shows on TV today. My twenty year old daughter loves it as much as I do. And you have to admit David Cassidy is sucha spunk. I also like the way he is with his step mother Shirley Jones I think this series made them closer. Great family viewing.,1264982400,7,507,3.980392156862745

3529642,5,B001DHE9FQ,"This show ended way too soon. It was a shame that David couldn't do more. The show all day and the recording studio all night were too much for the 23 year old. I simply loved it though. I was a little girl then and David Cassidy was the HOTTEST Guy around back in a time when innocence was still innocence. The casting was dead on. Shirley was great as the Mother. Being David's Stepmother only helped. The comedy as times was hokey, but a funny hokey. The music was actually good. Danny Bonaduce was the funniest young actor I'd ever seen at my young age and even still that way today. Susan Dey was gorgeous, witty and could truly act even though she had only modeled until two years ago when this first aired. Dave Madden and Danny were made to act together. They could have play Vaudeville when it was around. That's exactly how their humorous sparing came across. They were an act within an act. The kids were good for very young children. Shirley was the star but David Cassidy was the cherry on top. He came from an acting family and picked up his well earned whit from his father Jack. He was as cute as can be, a very talented comedian and a voice like silk. He could play guitar although they wouldn't let him except in the pilot. I like most young girl pinned up his pictures, read about him in Teen Magazine and dreamed about him at night. All that aside he was and still is a very talented man. His comedic timing outdid his Dad's. He and Susan had great chemistry as brother and sister and you knew that if they hadn't been cast that way they would have made a wonderful television couple. The whole group fit together like a true family. I'm really looking forward to reliving my early years when Season four comes out, what a pit there was no five etc... If you've never seen now is the time to give it a chance with the first three seasons. Enjoy!!!play Vaudeville when it was around. That's exactly how their humorous sparing came across.

awesome is David is one very talented singer.  I just
don't think he has been Marketed to the best of his

If you have enjoyed the first two seasons , you will get a kick out of the family antics provided by season three. It has your basic family plot lines that follow all good sit-coms. You have the diet episode the camping episode and a few of the ""period type episodes"" . You know ""womans lib"" and lets get ""mod""! But we all know we watch the episodes to hear Keith and Shirley sing. And sing they do. They continue the hit making songs that made the show a great treat. One little flaw is the way they sometimes spliced a singing segment into a plot line with out any continuity. The actors who play Chris Danny and Tracey, have vastly improved their lip snycing in season three. Season three makes you want to go right out and buy season four as soon as possible...if your an avid Partridge Family fan.",1226966400,,1012,5.291925465838509

I was delighted to hear that it came out on dvd thats the reason why i ordered it. season three was especially special to me maybe because of the memories i had as a child alot of the situations on the show happened to me in real life. I cant wait until the fourth season comes out on dvd the show only ran for 4 seasons i only wish they could have made more if you love the partridge family as much as i do i hope youll buy any or all of the seasons that amazon.com has to offer.",1225756800,2,631,3.9375

I still have my albums.  And, I am NOT ashamed to say so.

Ok, people, WHY DID IT TAKE 3 YEARS BETWEEN 2005 WHEN SEASON 1 & 2 WERE RELEASED ON DVD TO RELEASE SEASON 3?

It was a fun show.  Cast always did a great job in my opinion.  I was NEVER a Brady Bunch person.  A Partridge fan all the way!!

When out release day to purchase this.

So, after the 3 year wait to get this season out on DVD guess what?

NO EXTRAS!!

How about talking to the cast?  How about a  ""Making Of"" special?  How about a piece on the success of the show & the music?  Nope-nothing.

With only the 4th season yet to be released to DVD-how many years will that take?

Make the release of the 4th season special for fans & PUT EXTRAS  in the package!!!

Rated 5 stars for the show NO THE DVD PACKAGE WITH NO EXTRAS!!",1224115200,3,834,3.9216867469879517
3529658,5,B001DHE9FQ,"I'm a Partridge Family fan from when it first aired.  I had every album, knew every word to every song, watched every night.. had the neighbors in our garage with the record player and tennis racket for guitars, boxes and cans and chopsticks for my drums, the banana seat on my bike as a keyboard, and a real tamborine as we all played with the Partridges AS the Partridge Family, singing to imaginary crowds or garage rehersals.. for hours on end.

I have to disagree.  The FIRST season was the BEST!  (Jeremy Gelbwaks was a better Chris Partridge.  Had more and better lines).  However... owning Season 3 and hopefully soon Season 4 to complete my Partridge Family Collection would be the a dream come true.

No, it did not go to a 5th season, and I totally agree... I hope it doesn't take as long to release the final.. season 4..  Would be nice if they include some interviews with the cast.. (including Jeremy).  Would be nice to see HOW they recorded the music scenes for the show... (Pads over the drums and keyboards).  Maybe even include the ""This Is Your Life"" on Shirley Jones, as well as include the HORRIBLE NEW PARTRIDGE FAMILY pilot they did in 2005.  (It was better than The Partridge Family AD cartoon).

Would also be nice if they released another CD with more unreleased songs on it too as a set.

3529659,3,B001DHE9FQ,"""The Partridge Family: The Complete Third Season""  is a three-disc set containing all 25 episodes of the show's next-to-last season.  Premiering in September, 1970, ""The Partridge Family"" centers on a fatherless family of six who form a rock band and tour the country in their psychedelic-painted bus.  The band's members include mom Shirley (Shirley Jones) and her five kids:  eldest Keith (teen idol David Cassidy), keyboardist Laurie (Susan Dey), bassist and get-rich-quick schemer Danny (Danny Bonaduce), and the two youngest Partridges, Chris (Brian Forster) and Tracy (Suzanne Crough).  David Madden as the family's often exasperated manager, Reuben Kincaid, rounds out the cast.  Third-season adventures include Keith causing an international crisis when he escorts a beautiful princess; Laurie becoming romantically involved with a handsome young minister;  Keith being cast in a Hollywood movie;  Danny winning a racehorse who can't sleep; Reuben trying to quit smoking; and Shirley agreeing to date an old flame, only to discover the date includes his mother.  Several Partridge Family songs became genuine hits, including the theme, ""C'mon, Get Happy,"" which debuted in Season Two, and the number one hit, ""I Think I Love You.""  The show ran for four seasons on ABC and was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards.",1223856000,4,1324,5.446078431372549

Whether it's the groovy clothes (just look at those vests on the cover!), the rainbow bus, or remember the great music that we bopped to.  What about the 'stars' that came out of the show, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce, Shirley Jones (a star before the show), and David Cassidy.

The third installment of the Partridge Family experience begins with Laurie beats up the school bully and Keiths' nose gets out of joint, Mrs Partridge wins both Mother of the Year, and a court date, and then there's the time when Danny slipped off with a princess.  You can't see this set without giggling at the chicken suits, the sleepy race horse, and the 'learn your sex ed or we don't go on tour' episode.

Plus David Cassidy and Susan Day, although playing siblings, always looked like they'd rather be somewhere else making out. with each other. euwww! And Danny and Mr Kincaid one of the best odd couple vaudeville pairings of all time. As for the music, David and Shirley could actually sing, they were supported in studio by the best session musos and engineers in the business, and more often than not they had great song material supplied by some of the best songwriter's for hire. so the albums are not bad either.",1524441600,,604,4.761904761904762
