He was happy with it.",1384387200,,111,3.6666666666666665
531278,4,630298615X,"Chuck Connors was the only actor of fame involved in this story of some terrorists who wanted revenge against the U.S. by blowing up a nuclear plant.  They chose a plant in Kokomo, Indiana for some reason.  The actual city turned itself over to the movie makers with street auto chases, shooting and explosions.  There were many holes in the plot, but for action fans the movie certainly had that. Great film for natives of Kokomo who may have been in it or just to see the city.  Not a great movie that will be remembered by others.",1376611200,2,533,4.408163265306122
531279,3,630298615X,"This movie was shot in Kokomo In.  I was a member of the Kokomo Police Department during its shooting,  and was in the movie.  My birthday present was Chuck Conners line ""Sitzes...get the girl"".  Wish I looked like that now.  The story line is ok.  Hated it when the chief of police (Chuck Conners) ran over a pedestrian during the high speed chase and kept going.  Worst part was when the terrorist chased a large bus the whole movie but was switched for a ""Short Bus"" in the ending...Cheezy",1348185600,7,492,4.46067415730337
531280,1,630298615X,"This was filmed in my hometown of Kokomo.  I was a sophomore in high school at the time.  Everyone was all abuzz as we waited for it to premier.  Then it premiered.  What a waste of everything and everyone who worked on it.  My friends and I would always rent it on Halloween and do our own MST3K on it, even before MST3K had been created.  The most rediculous part: The 31-minute car chase around the courthouse.  It takes only two minutes to drive around it in real-life...and that's hitting all the red lights!  The best part: A schoolmate whom no one liked got a minor part--That of a shooting victim.  We all cheered when we saw her dead on screen.  She got mad at us, but we had a good time.  Anyway, don't bother with this movie if you want something with even the slightest bit of substance.  It has none.  But if you need a good laugh, this movie is for you!",1031875200,4,867,4.213414634146342

7833639,3,630298615X,This could happen all across the USA at any moment,1496448000,,50,4.1
7833640,5,630298615X,"Wonderful, amazing schlock with a surprising gritty feel and some amazing stunts and effects. Surprisingly, nearly every security officer and cop in this movie isn't portrayed as a dolt, and there's a 30 minute stretch from minutes 15 through 46 that has one of the best, most exciting car chases ever - it has everything except a boat chase. The story is unimportant but, aside from the nerd's choice towards the end, and the finale action sequence, everybody's character arcs feel like they make sense and fit within the framework presented.

If you want cheese, schlock, silliness, action, shooting, and just plain ol' 1980s B-movie fun, you need to watch Terror Squad.",1475020800,,672,5.0

7833644,4,630298615X,I remember watching this movie on cabel way back in the day watching it now it's so bad it's good. The acting is horrible like the other reviews there are so many mistakes like The janitor who gets killed later on his friend finds him In the hallway he's still breathing. The ending goes from a big bus to a short bus. If you like chessey movies then this is for you,1437091200,,366,4.097222222222222
7833645,1,630298615X,"I just watched it because I am from Kokomo Indiana. It was terrible, but nice to see all the old landmarks. Chuck Connors performance was flat. Everything blew up, even the water tower.",1427068800,,185,4.636363636363637
7833646,2,630298615X,"I was living in Kokomo when this was filmed, I actually had a very small part in the making of this film (yes, I'm ashamed to admit that). When it was finished, we had a special screening of the film and then a reception at the Kokomo Country Club. Let's just say that the mood of everyone was rather......low and disappointed. From the cheesy car chases, to the over-done scene of the terrorists driving around the town square machine-gunning everyone in sight, to the magical shrinking/growing school bus, to Chuck Connors whipping off his sunglasses and saying ""Damn!"", it falls completely flat. It was so bad, the movie was never released nationally and I'm rather surprised that official VHS copies exist (I don't expect to ever see it on DVD). The only reasons it gets two stars is because there's a quick scene in the town where they placed the original Batmobile (you see a few ""bullets"" hit it), and it does make for a good ""bad"" movie that you can watch with your friends, drink beer, laugh and make snarky comments a-la MST3K-style. A buddy of mine was planning to send the MST3K guys a copy of this monstrosity, as far as I know he never did. Today there are rumors of the show starting back up, and if it does, I will make sure they get a copy, as it definitely needs to be torn apart by those guys!",1400803200,,1312,4.448132780082988
7833647,1,630298615X,"I wanted this movie because I have lived in the town where the movie took place since 1980.  I remember when it was being filmed and some of my friends had walk on parts or crowd shots.  The movie has so many mixups in the cars that it made the Dukes Of Hazard TV show look like an Emmy award winner.  A typical example was when Chuck Connors is at the Cone Palace drive in, he is in a Dodge police car but as he pulls out he is in a Ford and back in a Dodge before the next intersection.  The school bus scene at the end is so crazy where in the space of two minutes at least four different buses are used as each has different lettering on the side and they range from 66 passenger to 20 passenger buses.  As I said, I wanted it because it was filmed in Kokomo Indiana with the premiss of Islamic terrorists attacking a nuclear power plant down the road (the closest is over three hours away.",1390348800,,894,4.028248587570621
