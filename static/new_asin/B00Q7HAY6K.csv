8690699,1,B00Q7HAY6K,Do not purchase this movie if you are looking for the version with OJ Simpson and Elizabeth Montgomery. The Dvd cover is wrong.,1341964800,2,127,4.565217391304348
8690700,1,B00Q7HAY6K,"This is a false advertisement!  The cover displayed with Elizabeth Montgomery -vs- what you receive is totally different.  I ordered this movie looking for Elizabeth Montgomery, and it is NOT Elizabeth Montgomery's movie!  I knew it sounded too good to be true at that price!  This movie plays actors/actresses whom nobody ever heard of!  What is most disturbing about the whole issue is you don't get what you paid for!  Again, this is false advertising, and I am seeking a refund.",1312156800,3,482,4.888888888888889

It needs to be changed! I have purchased several things through Amazon and its sellers, have never had this problem before but now I know to be completely thorough when making further purchases from this website if I even ever decide to do so again.",1301097600,6,405,4.71830985915493
8690702,1,B00Q7HAY6K,"This is not the correct movie which stars ;  Elizabeth Montgomery and O,J. Simpson. This is the wrong movie . The movie you are selling is starring Peter Weller. Plese correct this as soon as possible",1157760000,17,200,4.555555555555555
