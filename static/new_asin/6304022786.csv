7859660,4,6304022786,"This is a good video for romantics and fans of the band alike. With songs such as ""The Search Is Over"", ""Is This Love"" and ""High On You"", it is the perfect video to watch with that special  someone. However, if you are a big fan of the band, videos such as  ""Eye Of The Tiger"" and ""Burning Heart"" bring all the  energy of the band to your TV screen. It would've been excellent to include  ""The Moment Of Truth"" to make this a collector's item.",925689600,3,443,4.116279069767442
