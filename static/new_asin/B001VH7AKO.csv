8346465,5,B001VH7AKO,"I've been teaching chemistry for 6 years, I now teach honors and AP chemistry. While these videos are not quite up to what you'd want for AP chemistry, they are flat out EXCELLENT for honors or college-prep chemistry and they have a much more current feel than the traditional, and age-worn ""World of Chemistry"" videos (though we likely all have these in our school libraries.)

In addition to using these DVDs in class, you can assign the online version of the videos to your students from the GPBS web site (Google GPBS Chemistry videos and you're there), and the web sites for each episode provide at least one note taking guide that the kids can use while watching the video AND one or more worksheets that can be used to strengthen understanding the concepts. This blends in perfectly with the topics covered in HS chemistry and it's a great homework type assignment, or if you're absent these videos are excellent to use then as I feel strongly that these sufficiently cover the material in question such that if your kids assiduously work the note taking guide they'll have learned the topics at hand, or at least gotten an strong initial idea of what the main themes covered are.

Bottom line, great stuff and you should use their online material for homework and for in-school use the DVDs you can buy here to support the GPBS efforts here, which I think are outstanding and were a well-spent expenditure of taxpayer funds for education.",1323216000,6,1446,4.734126984126984
