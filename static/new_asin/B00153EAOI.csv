It doesn't show you any of the items shown on the cover, and barely gives any info on how to do the most simple, mundane shapes.  The recording is terrible.  Obviously, this gentleman set up his handheld video in front of himself and hoped that it would be captured.  Much of it was not.  For example, you will see him begin a step and then the balloon disappears from view.  By the time the balloon is in view, he has gone through one or two steps and you can't figure out how to get there.  Save your money and get a book. This guy is awful awful awful. . . I think I need a new word for awful!!",1208908800,8,646,4.0
