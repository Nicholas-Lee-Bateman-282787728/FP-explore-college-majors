Steve Austin multi-picture deal with Anchor Bay films has resulted in another direct to DVD feature here in ""Hunt To Kill."" Austin stars as a Jim Rhodes, a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Montana, who has his daughter with him on Winter vacation with them having a strained relationship. She gets caught shoplifting & is being held in the local sheriff's office for him to come pick her up. Meanwhile a band of robbers in Las Vegas were betrayed by one of their own members of the team who takes off with all the loot leading the head villian Banks (Gil Bellows) to the same Sheriff's office where Rhodes & his daughter is. From there, Rhodes is forced to lead the band of criminals throught the wilderness with so many issues being dealt with such as the villians turning on each other, his daughter being held hostage while she's still having issues & conflict with him, and just trying to survive in the wild.

The Stranger:
Steve Austin's third starring role has him as a former F.B.I. agent who had gone rouge & is now hunted by not only the F.B.I. but also the Russian mob due to him being involved with a top-secret investigation that revolved around an internal mole & a hidden amount of money...with him having no clue why due to him having his memory blocked past a few quick unclear flashes of various things like a little girl & a briefcase. The main people looking for him is his psychologist Grace (played by Erica Cerra) who attempts to help figure out what is blocked from his memory & F.B.I. agent Mason Reese (played by Adam Beech) who has a past with both characters & has his own motives for helping restore his memory.
 Eventhough I am a Steve Austin fan from his wrestling career & enjoyed his previous acting roles, that just wasn't the case here & this is a movie I wouldn't waste my money on.

""Hunt To Kill"" had most of the action in this movie consist of using weapons (shooting weapons like guns & a crossbow) along with an explosion & some stunts but there are two fights with one being between Rhodes & Banks along with one of two mini reunions from the ""Expendables"" movie with Austin's character fighting Gary Daniels' character of Jensen but as the plot was very basic with some of the characters were too ""cartoonish"" for my taste & none of the action here really got an emotion out me.  ""The Stranger"" was trying to be sold as an action movie but most of the action (which is limited to a few chase scenes) takes a backstage to a heavy amount of dialog & storytelling which is a heavy disappointment as it just didn't balance & it got annoying with the heavy amount of on & off flashbacks throughout the film with the movie just came off more as a 88 minute background story strictly to setup the future sequels which made this movie easily forgettable once I finished watching it to the point where if you notice, I don't even mention the name of Austin's character but I don't remember it.  In then end, these were two of my least favorite movies of his & two that can be easily skipped in favor of his better ones.",1399852800,,3062,4.431616341030195
