8001467,1,B0000DZTL3,"Alright.  So everyone here I'm sure knows that most sequels are never as good as the originals.  Well this is a 100% horrible sequel.

Apparently someone wanted to recreate the glory of the original film, 'Angels In The Outfield'.  This movie is far from the original.  I don't understand why people just can't leave a good movie be and not make a so-called sequel.

I bought 'Angels In The Infield' as a combo pack with the original 'Angels In The Outfield' and 'Angels In The Endzone' plus another movie I haven't watched yet.  I was thinking well, since this is a sequel to the original movie, I thought why not give it a try? Well, I was stupid to buy it.  It's a low budget film, sadly.  With horrible acting and visual effects.  'Angels In The Endzone' is somewhat of a sequel to 'Angels In The Outfield' but it is WAY BETTER than 'Angels In The Infield'.

To anyone who wants to buy this horrible sequel movie, I implore you NOT TO! You'll be disappointed that you wasted your money. There will never ever be as good a baseball movie as 'Angels In The Outfield', even if they make more sequels.  If you want a good movie go and buy the original movie if you haven't watched it or you don't have it already.  You could also buy 'Angels In The Endzone'.  It wasn't a bad movie at all.",1351209600,,1289,4.338912133891213
8001468,2,B0000DZTL3,"The names have been changed but the similarities with ""Angels in the Outfield"" outweigh the differences. In both cases, Disney's angels exist to boost human self-confidence, extract tears and elicit laughs, even if they have to stoop to manipulative melodrama or nose-picking type humor to accomplish these things. One difference between ""Infield"" and ""Outfield"" is that we see heaven in ""Infield"", and it is not a pretty sight. Disney's heaven is a dangerous, gloomy world full of mashed potatoes and evidently only right-handed people can go there because Babe Ruth made it to Disney heaven, but he had to convert to right-handedness. Small children will probably enjoy the slapstick but others will receive more nourishment from real mashed potatoes.",1329264000,,753,5.336134453781512

This Movie is NO where as good as the first and Now I am not surprised that I have never heard of it. It was a Little dissappointing. As for the service it was GREAT The product was received VERY Fast and in EXCELLENT Condition!!!",1287532800,,540,5.597560975609756
