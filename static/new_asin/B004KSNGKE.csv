8433369,4,B004KSNGKE,this is probably the best predator movie to me I really wish they had a sequel I would recommend it if you like predator,1426464000,,120,4.041666666666667
8433370,5,B004KSNGKE,"Nothing spectacular, but any fanboy will love it. I wasn't a big fan of the direction taken with Alien vs Predator, this had a much better story.",1372032000,,145,4.407407407407407
8433371,5,B004KSNGKE,"it not bad, if you're in to this sort of movie.  i've seen the original, and i've seen stuff like aliens v predator 2: it's as good as the original, and it beats the @$$ out of avp2.

don't know which twist caught me off guard more: the original whazzat w/topher grace or adrian brody's buff bod.  actually, topher wasn't much of a surprise.  the other? WHOA!",1359936000,,359,4.313432835820896

8433373,4,B004KSNGKE,"Surround sound, blu-ray player, and a very large television made for a wonderful Saturday watching this movie.  Three disks in one for the price was hard to beat.",1329264000,,162,4.785714285714286
8433374,5,B004KSNGKE,This movie is basically a remake of the first with the style of aliens mixed in a little. I find this movie to be a good addition to the predator series. this movie is filled with mystery and monsters. Note that their isn't only a new breed of predator there are dogs. The only thing that would have made this movie perfect is if Kevin Peter Hall were still alive. Having him this film would have made it perfect. None-the-less this movie is a great addition to your predator/alien collection.,1307750400,,493,4.488888888888889
8433375,5,B004KSNGKE,"First, J. Paul ""John doe"", please learn punctuation, paragraphs and how to make a very long rant readable.  I tried to grind through a few sentences of your review but couldn't continue.

The movie:
I enjoyed it very much.  It was inferior to Predator and to Alien but it was still very entertaining sci-fi.

<Spoilers ahead!>

My first peeve was with the mighty Russian fellow with his mini-gun ala Jesse the Governor (I'm from Minnesota and voted for him so I get to say that) from Predator.  A couple humans are pinned down by the mini-gun firing for several minutes continuously and have to sneak behind the Russian to stop him from firing.  The problem: those mini-guns go through ammo at a ferocious rate.  Jesse the Body or the sturdy Russian fellow could carry a backpack with a hundred pounds, maybe more, of ammo for the gun.  A mini-gun will scream through that much ammo in a few seconds.  To run such a weapon for the many minutes it did in the film would require semi-truck loads of ammo.

Aside from that one glaring blunder, I was able to look past the usual groan-worthy stuff any modern action film presents and had a good time.

The twist at the end pleased me very much as did the responses by the surviving humans to their new reality.",1304294400,3,1256,4.508849557522124
