8657462,4,B00KC04PSQ,"The content of the presentation is EXTREMELY INSTRUCTIVE; it answers a large number of questions how to handle certain positions I have reached in some 50+ informal games played over the years using the KID.

However, be aware that GM Leonid Kritz has a strong foreign accent. if you are hard of hearing, you will likely not pick up initially whether he has said d4 or b4 or e4, for example. Often he makes side remarks while the video shows the main line being presented and you will have to listen to the DVD multiple times to pick up what he says. However, it is worth the extra work.

In terms of video production , the team does a poor editing effort. For example, if the presenter makes a mistake - pushing the wrong piece - no effort was made to repeat the presentation and correct the error. However, this is quite common with Chess DVDs by most publishers.

If you play the KID, you need this DVD.",1413158400,,906,4.380952380952381
