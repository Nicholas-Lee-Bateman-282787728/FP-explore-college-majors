500055,5,6302678846,I thought this movie was great it was comedy with a twist of sadness and a squeez of romance. That explainde a little of what some kids live through day in and day out.  I mostly liked the way it was based on reality.  My  favorite character was the baby. It was funny that he had such a deep  voice. AND that kid in the purple jacket he was the dopest!  I don't  recomend this movies to kids under 8 due to the some what of a sexual theme  involved in the plot.,944179200,10,462,3.903225806451613

Oh my stars, it was every bit as fun as the first time I saw it, and I can't recall now where I saw it first, possibly cable. I remember all of the kids at school talking about it though before even that.
I will just give fair warning and say that it's not for anyone aiming to be politically correct, nor is it for parents who are too easily offended by anything more than a screwdriver sitting on the work-table. It is also not. for. kids. Especially impressionable ones, who tend to mimic what they see. Enjoy!",1486598400,2,734,4.364963503649635

500922,4,6302678846,"""A film that should have been seen or heard of back in the late 1990s was heard about around 2013 ironically (since this film did not have much of a release or any popularity in the UK). Nothing more offensive than The Simpsons or Roger Rabbit but something of a hidden gem.

Bebe's Kids takes much of Robin Harris, a stand-up comedian also featured from the House Party films, and his skits about these bad, irresponsible children to animation with Harris and a woman named Jamika he met exaggerated to a scenario where Harris has to take care of them at a theme park in place of Bebe's leave. The story is a little more than a one-note scenario but does provide for some laughs (much into how the 80s/90s culture was at the time), some amusing songs (especially much of the timeless 90s R&B jams), and a sympathetic yet quirky Harris who, in the bachelor in all of us, can relate to. The animation for its time does not feel too cheap but definitely is not a Disney or Warner Bros. film.

Thankfully, what stands out is how the film allows it to have a sense of energy and oddity in its steps that for many animated films of its time, was something to look forward to. It was exaggerated and crazy but still realistic and believable enough.

While the film might not be South Park-level content, there is enough mild bad language (ass, damn, hell at most), oblique innuendos (flirting mostly), drinking, smoking, and reckless behaviour and mayhem from the children that could make some parents a bit worried if showing to a younger child. At best, it would be OK for a PG and is best recommended for non-impressionable children 8 to 10 and older.""",1371340800,,1649,4.526845637583893

 Its safe for me to say that to fully enjoy this movie you have to relate or have an understanding (primarily the jokes)of what goes on in this movie. Bebe kids is an example of this because the funny thing about the trio is just about every family (primarily black families) know bebe kids. I have bebe kids in my family but not as extreme as the kids in this movie and that made it even more funny. Matter of fact all the characters in this movie I could relate to in some shape or form because I've seen or knew peaple like them.

 I hear many peaple argue its offensive too, but as a black woman myself Its safe for me to say that this movie didn't offend me in anyway. I found everything funny and even clever in many spots.

Unfortnately, Robin himself died before this got off the ground. Faizon Love does a decent imitation of the master, but it just isn't the same. The story of the buckwild demons (excuseme, I mean kids) turned loose in an amusement park has its moments, but wears thin after a while (espeically the courtroom scene with Presidents George Washington, Lincoln, and Nixon putting the bratocious ones on trial). However, the film makes a grim detour in reality by showing the empty kitchen in the wild kids' equally empty ghetto apartment to make some pointed social commentary on why they are so untamed.

From Bruce Smith, the creator of Disney's ""The Proud Family"", it contains a few rap-music numbers (""He Ain't Havin' It"" being the best) that threaten to derail the story, but they're brief enough to ignore.

The transfer is typical Paramount non-remastered conversion from film stock, but it's finally in widescreen (I even caught a joke that's missing from the fullscreen tape) and has good sound.  You'll need that to catch the mass of infectiously quotable lines aplenty.

Directed by Bruce W. Smith made a entertaining anamation film, which is The Simpsons meets Alvin and the Chipmunks. This film is a Tribute to Robin Harris brand of sense of humor. This has become a Cult Hit on Video than it did in Theaters. A well made film, which is more for the adults than children. Grade:B+.",1012953600,,754,4.510948905109489

Anyway, this movie is based on the stand-up comedy of the late Robin Harris. For those interested in the film, I think a good way to think of this movie might be ""The Problem Child"" time three - only funnier! Faizon Love did an excellent job as Robin, but the most memorable (and most hillarious!) voice casting was Tone Loc as the baby Pee Wee. Also, the voice of Kahill (the son of Robin's love interest) was performed by Marques Houston of the group Immature.
This film offers a commentary on a disintegrating society's effect on the younger generation and emphasizes the importance of role models in childrens' lives. But enough of that....SEE THIS MOVIE!",1005350400,4,882,4.733766233766234

501141,5,6302678846,I cannot say enough about this movie. This has got to be my all-time favorite. I saw this in the theatre several years ago when I was five. I still love this movie. I can be truthful when I say I've seen it over a hundred times and I don't even own it yet. This should've been up for an academy award. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie has issues. Everyone needs to own a copy of this movie. You definitely won't regret it.,973555200,,425,4.071428571428571
