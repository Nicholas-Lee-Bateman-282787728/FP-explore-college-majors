8578686,5,B00C89EMBY,"The ""Pearl of the Black Sea"" is still embedded into the intricate and masterful array of painters, poets, musicians and, of course, their devotees. In his ""Artists of Odessa"" Dima Khavin takes you on an intimate trip through its labirinth.",1371081600,,239,5.0
8578687,5,B00C89EMBY,"Roitburd, Podvoisky, Voitsehov,  Essentially, these names embody the art scene of Odessa during last decades.  But instead of giving them an official glossy presentation, the film introduces these personalities rather casually. Dealing with local artists chats and stories in a daily and approachable manner, the documentary pictures the city from a perspective seldom noticed and unmasks the nature of its habitants.

The series of short conversations by the characters of different age, nationalities and lifestyles convey the renowned idea that its not the odessits who live in Odessa, but it is Odessa that lives inside its people. It is this intrinsic manner of abstracting from the material reality and lightheartedly living in the absurd world that unites these people into one big family named odessits.  Here, their soulful and intense mix of absurdity, creativity, individuality, and humor is depicted so bitingly that it often hurts.

The documentary also turns a visionary eye on the whole neighborhood, and you can almost sense the physicality of Odessas decadence from the screen. This relatively young (just over 200 year-old) city looks ancient and worn out.  Nonetheless, through the whole film, the city itself, although always present, stands relatively in the background and, like an old wise granny, seems just to observe a bunch of her naughty offsprings messing around in the playground.

All in all, this is a disclosing, resonate and full of Odessa spirit film. Highly recommended for all Odessa fans, and not only.",1370131200,,1540,5.338842975206612
8578688,5,B00C89EMBY,"This documentary is about the legendary Black Sea port town of Odessa and its bohemian milieu of poets and artists. You hear the poets read their works and artists show their art in the studios, the cafes, the ruins, the backwater streets, and in one memorable scene, in a marketplace next to a bunch of boar heads resting on the counter. It's like taking a guided tour of the boundary where the town creates the artists and the artists recreate the town. And who could object to seeing less savory places and hearing less savory poetry than one would find as a ""regular"" tourist!",1369785600,,580,4.586538461538462
