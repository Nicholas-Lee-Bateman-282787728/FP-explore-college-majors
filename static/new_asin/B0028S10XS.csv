Written by Alex Metcalf and directed by William Olsson, ""An American Affair"" at least earns points for originality.  For what starts out as a fairly conventional coming-of-age tale set in 1963 Washington D.C. suddenly turns into a piece of historical fiction when the obligatory older woman 13-year-old Adam Stafford (Cameron Bright) falls madly in love with turns out to be none other than the mistress of President John F. Kennedy himself.  Thus, not only is Adam introduced to the wonderful world of raging hormones but to the sociopolitical issues of the day as well.

Adam is the son of two journalists who have no clue their child has been peeping into the home across the way, enjoying a full-court view of Catherine Caswell (nicely played by Gretchen Mol), a glamorous divorcee and ex-CIA agent guaranteed to get any healthy young American lad's juices flowing.  When Adam introduces himself to her, Catherine hires him on as a gardener, a setup that gives the youngster plenty of opportunity to not only make his move on this prospective conquest but, thanks to her uniquely complicated social life, to have a special behind-the-scenes glimpse into a bit of juicy, albeit undocumented, political history.

""An American Affair"" throws so many disparate elements into the mix - May/December romance (or maybe more like February/August), lurid political melodrama, adolescent wish-fulfillment, cloak-and-dagger espionage, conspiracy-theory speculation - that it can't help but generate a certain fascination, even when the story itself is not all that convincing or the passion for the subject not everything it could be (this applies mainly to the first half).

All the ""Summer of `42"" stuff is, ultimately, far less compelling than the political details of the period, steeped as they are in Kennedy-era glamour and paranoia, with larger-than-life figures acting out a torrid little soap opera in the foregroound, while shadowy figures (mainly Cubans and CIA agents) skulk around in the background.  The scenes surrounding the assassination are treated with subtlety and restraint, making them all the more heartbreaking and poignant for those in the audience who lived through the experience.  In fact, the whole last half hour of the film achieves a haunting sadness that finally penetrates to the very marrow of one`s bones.

The movie certainly won't solve the puzzle as to ""Who killed JFK?,"" but it has some fun trying to piece it all together.",1253836800,24,2465,5.217721518987342
3874053,3,B0028S10XS,"This movie, clearly and transparently based on the last year in the life of Mary Pinchot Meyer, is, unfortunately, not as good as it could have been. All the real characters are here and very thinly disguised: Ms. Meyer, Cord Meyer, James Angleton, JFK, with the addition of a fictional nice teen-age boy who happens to live next door. This character is the problem. Though well-acted, the role is poorly conceived, and the boy's various shadowings and spyings look absurd. Plus there's some tiresome material set at his Catholic day school. Gretchen Mol is wonderful, as is the actor who plays the Angleton character. But this could have been so much better if the filmmakers had taken a tougher position. Left out are Ben and Tony Bradlee and their role in the destruction of Mary Pinchot Meyer's (possibly inflammatory) diary. On the plus side, the LSD scene is nicely done. Bottom line: a fascinating tale receives a mediocre treatment. What a shame!",1249603200,20,954,4.895061728395062

3874055,4,B0028S10XS,"I am much too young to remember JFK as President or the assassination so I watched this movie to learn what reportedly happened while he was in the White House. His infidelity came as no surprise because Clinton proved the President should not be put on a pedestal, they are human just like everyone else.  I would be interested in the REAL story of JFK's presidency but I doubt that story will ever be written.  Overall the movie was interesting but I would have liked to see more about the First Family, warts and all. If you are interested in factual history, this is not the movie for you. Gretchen Mol played her part very well.",1486684800,,633,4.448275862068965
3874056,3,B0028S10XS,"A missed opportunity.  Gretchen Mol makes this movie work, but my goodness, did this movie miss a chance at telling a real story... Excerpt from Wikipedia:

In 1983, former Harvard University psychology lecturer Timothy Leary claimed that in the spring of 1962, Pinchot Meyer, who, according to her biographer Nina Burleigh ""wore manners and charm like a second skin"",[23] told Leary she was taking part in a plan to avert worldwide nuclear war by convincing powerful male members of the Washington establishment to take mind-altering drugs, which would presumably lead them to conclude that the Cold War was meaningless.[55][56]

According to Leary, Meyer had sought him out for the purpose of learning how to conduct LSD sessions with these powerful men, including, she strongly implied, President John F. Kennedy, who was then her lover. Leary alleged that Pinchot Meyer told him she had shared in this plan with at least seven other Washington socialite friends who held similar political views and were trying to supply LSD to a small circle of high-ranking government officials. Leary also claimed that Pinchot Meyer had asked him for help while in a state of fear for her own life after the assassination of President Kennedy.

In his biography Flashbacks (1983), Leary claimed he had a call from Pinchot Meyer soon after the Kennedy assassination during which she sobbed and said, ""They couldn't control him any more. He was changing too fast...They've covered everything up. I gotta come see you. I'm afraid. Be careful.""[57]

The movie is not about LSD, but the idea that the president of the US would have changed 'too fast',  because of the mind-altering drugs a serious love interest gave him, now there's a story ...",1485907200,,1730,5.052631578947368

Most ""characters"" are cardboard cutouts, and the screenplay telegraphs nearly every turn in the plot way before it should (IF it should).  Unfortunately, the main character of the boy is probably not up to the demands of the script, and is leaden in his teenage angst and confusion instead of passionate.  The camerawork, lighting, energy level of most of the cast, are all uninspiring.  Movies like this are a nail in the coffin to the lauded ""Independent Film.""",1474416000,,646,4.845454545454546

3874113,5,B0028S10XS,"An American Affair is as one other reviewer writes, a thinly disguised adaptation of the last year of the life of Mary Pinchot Meyer, a woman known to have been extremely close to JFK. I read the book ""A Very Private Woman"" a couple of years ago and was so fascinated with the story (about which I had known nothing) I decided to look further. I then read ""Mary's Mosaic"", a book written by one of the sons of a close friend of the Meyer family, Peter Janney. Mr. Janney literally grew up around Cord and Mary Meyer and their sons. Both of these books give an extraordinary look at the assassination of a president and the assassination of a woman with whom he was involved. This movie as an adaptation is interesting. I've always like Gretchen Mol. The details were not exactly true, but it was well presented. The part of the boy was well played, but unnecessary for the story. It tended to add a bit of the lurid that wasn't part of the real story. The assassinations of both JFK and Mary Meyer are horrifying and I think anyone interested in this bit of history would do well to read both books. It might leave you with a different notion about the JFK murder. I know it did me.

3874229,3,B0028S10XS,"There was more than one MM in JFK's life.
Mary Pinchot Meyer married Cord Meyer (CIA)
JFK & Jackie.moved next door.
JFK had the hots for MPM. They were in touch up until his assassination.
She voiced disagreement with the Warren Report. She was murdered 3 weeks later.
Her diary is missing, and the murder is unsolved.
It's too bad we don't know more of history. This movie could have been enlightening.
I think if people knew more about what was really going on then, this may have been more interesting, but people here are commenting about Marilyn and that's not the story. Of course, some only watched it because they thought it to be about MM.
Still it's quite telling most people have never even heard of MPM. Even many who lobe MM.
Heck most kids now don't know what's a Warren Report, something they skipped in school?
Anyway the failure of this film to capitalize on the historical facts which have since come to light is sad, it had such potential. I'd like to give it an A for effort, but, I'm not sure how much effort went into what - the creative touch of the hormonal young voyeur - it obfuscates, almost trivializes the elusive truth.",1468540800,2,1149,4.502392344497608

The first time I came across this movie by accident, which was on television, I thought it was completely fictional until near the end.  The second time I watched with eyes wide open and then, as I said, became convinced that there was more to JFK's death than what we've generally been told.  Reading the above mentioned book and also books by Howard Fast may convince you, also.

But this is a movie review.  I gave it four stars because I felt it was well done, fascinating not only in its somewhat historical accuracy but also because it presented a watchable, fictional story line.",1376438400,10,792,4.503496503496503

Inventing a teenager who is sexually interested in his beautiful neighbor is ""dime-store novel"" approach.  The story of CIA involvement, her missing diary, the mysterious connections with various government officials and Cuban nationals all deserved a much more serious story line.  The ""teenager"" spoiled my interest in the true nature of the story.  I'm sorry I wasted my time watching the movie.",1374710400,,488,5.554054054054054

3874301,5,B0028S10XS,"It is a gripping story that clearly illistrates the atmosphere of the day.  For history fanatics, it does make some leaps of faith.  But there is much more truth in it than fiction.  I have studied the assassination from multiple sorces.  When the same names keep popping up, it gains truth in my world.  So if you want to get the ""feel"" of those days and these people, this is your movie.  If you require absolute historical accuracy, get a documentary DVD.
  The portrayal by Mol is excellent.  The politcs are nicely contrasted with the boy's Nixonite parents.  It leaves one saddened, and feeling like you were asleep during those days and missed it all.",1341964800,7,658,4.643478260869565
3874302,2,B0028S10XS,"Aren't the interesting plots about life's circumstances really about conflict and struggle?

This movie is frustrating. It is so obviously based upon the story of Mary Pinchot Meyer and some of the scandalous circumstances of her life and death, yet never takes that final leap into truly telling the tale that is so interesting. In fact, the screenwriter masks the story by too intensely weaving a sub plot of an adolescent neighbor of the main character, actress Gretchen Mol, where the story no longer is about the woman and fixation of this boy, who is having an affair with JFK, but, rather, becomes about the coming of age trials of this same boy. Was it to avoid law suits?

Without boring you with too much plot and spoilers, I will jump to my conclusion: the real story (or what is alleged)is of Mary P. Meyer. It is far more interesting than what this movie delves to. In fact, what this movie delves to is really nothing. The conflict of maturation and puberty of a boy that witnesses a rendezvous between his neighbor and JFK is so thin and lacking, that it pales to the story of the true scandal and its background. You keep wishing that the movie will take a precipitous turn into the interesting and fact based story, but it only skims and, continually, returns to that of boy. His conflict is so much less interesting. His tribulations are so trivial and standard.

As another reviewer commented, this is Summer of 42 - light, set on the back drop of Mary Pinchot Meyer's life. It should have been the inverse. It does not succeed in any artistic endeavor.",1279584000,4,1572,4.607142857142857
3874303,4,B0028S10XS,"An American Affair is about a teenage boy who constantly gets into fights, disobeys his parents and the nuns at church, and falls in love with his next door neighbor- a woman who apparently has ties with John F. Kennedy and other people in Washington DC (where the storyline takes place).  Of course we don't actually get to see the John F. Kennedy character, but oh well.

Anyway, the story focuses mainly on the next door neighbor (an attractive middle aged woman) and the relationship she develops with the boy across the street.  The parents STRONGLY disapprove of their son making constant visits to the womans home because the woman has a confusing, troubled life.  The mother tries explaining what she's like by simply saying ""She's different, so stay away from her"".

You'll quickly discover the woman has quite a few male friends that she comes into contact with all the time, and they are tied to the White House.  You'll have to watch the storyline to find out what their connections are and why they make frequent visits to the womans home.

Anyway, the woman is perfectly aware that the boy has a serious crush on her, but nothing ever comes out of it.  By that I mean no relationship ever forms or anything.

Basically An American Affair gives the viewer yet another idea what it was like living in the early to mid 60's and experiencing the Kennedy assassination incident.  That's why when the moment Kennedy is killed, you witness the emotional reactions of all the characters in the movie.

Of course a big question as to why the main character himself (the teenage boy) doesn't feel anything over the incident is perhaps a storyline blunder.

This is a pretty good movie with a decent storyline.  I have to wonder though, if that one scene showing the teenage boy praying in church after the assassination took place is a plot inconsistency.

He was praying in a completely empty church in Washington DC.  You'd think the entire church would be filled with people praying for John F. Kennedy given the sudden and shocking way the incident happened.  Maybe not.  Maybe people were glued to their television sets and unable to move or think clearly afterwards.

Anyway, it's a quality film.  I recommend it.",1277078400,,2223,4.7421875
