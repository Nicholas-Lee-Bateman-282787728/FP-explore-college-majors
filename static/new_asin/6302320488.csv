Returning home, finding love, fighting for that love, pride and  common sense are all values depicted artfully and entertainingly. - jk",912384000,,294,4.86

455178,5,6302320488,"Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns from America to his birthplace, a small town called Innisfree in Ireland. He goes to buy the old homestead (his grandfather had been sent to Australia; his father went to America when he was a wee lad). The land and cottage are owned by the Widow Tillane. She is reluctant to sell until town bully Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) shows up and tries to outbid the American. Slightly annoyed, she agrees to sell to Sean. Meanwhile, Sean has fallen for a beautiful redhead (Maureen O'Hara) who turns out to be Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of Will. She is excited by the prospect of marrying Sean but wants to follow the Irish proprieties--having a matchmaker start the arrangements, getting permission from the family, etc. Will is not at all enthusiastic about the match so plenty of conflict ensues. The local parish priest, the Protestant minister and his wife, and matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald in a great performance) rally to Sean's cause, especially when he seems less than willing to fight for the love of Mary Kate. Sean suffers from a bit of culture clash and from his own personal demons.

The movie is an amazing love story, steeped in Irish culture and actually filmed in Ireland (a novelty for Hollywood in 1952).  Sean and Mary Kate are very layered characters who have a lot of chemistry. Wayne and O'Hara are great together. The movie well balances the serious and the silly elements of the story. Dramatic moments are tempered with a quintessentially Irish sense of whimsy. The movie is utterly delightful.

Highly recommended.

Also, this movie was the subject of A Good Story is Hard to Find podcast #39.",1521158400,,1671,4.852631578947369

Not this version. The picture didn't jump or do any strange stuff. It was very sharp like you'd expect from a Blu-ray version. The color was good. In short, it was what I wanted.

The movie is a timeless classic and a must for any John Wayne fan. I could go on about the movie but its been covered by other reviews.

I have the prior DVD release, one of the worst DVD transfers in existence - just execrable video (DO NOT buy the old DVD!). I am very grateful that this Blu-Ray release corrects the faults of the DVD, with excellent video and audio. The movie itself benefits from stellar performances by Wayne and the incomparable Maureen O'Hara, as well as from Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen, and the ever-reliable Ward Bond (Note that Wayne, O'Hara (honorary), Fitzgerald, and McLaglen are all Oscar winners, along with director John Ford who won 4 Best Director Oscars. including one for this movie). And the fight at the end IS the cinematic definition of ""donnybrook.""

Hands down, it's one of his and Maureen O'Hara's best films. Funny in spots, good ol' fashioned romantic in other spots. They don't make them like his anymore! I corresponded with a gentleman in Ireland who lives near the area where this film was shot and he had a wealth of information. Sadly, the beautiful bungalow that John Wayne ""bought"" in this movie is a shambles today but it's going to be restored to look like it did in this movie.

John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara not only succeeded in becoming one of Hollywood's most famous on-screen couples, but together--and with the help of a star-studded cast--they genuinely embodied the country of Ireland, as it was and as it should always be... Unfortunately, I had to exchange this particular DVD and order another version entirely, as this version does NOT contain the closed-caption option, which I'm afraid is very necessary in my home. Please keep this in mind; but if it makes no difference to you, then by all means buy away! Captions or no, this movie is hands-down one of the best ever made!

455354,5,6302320488,One of my old time favorite movies.  I initially bought the The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition) and the picture quality was very poor.  I bought this edition by Oliver Films in and the picture is clear.  Audio is great.  There was a huge difference.  The one thing it's missing is Closed-captioned which may be needed by some.,1506124800,,326,4.649122807017544

455357,5,6302320488,"A mysterious yank (The Quiet Man) arrives on the train and asks for directions to Innisfree. This quiet man turns out to be returning to his home after a hard life in America. There he purchases his old home to the shegrim of the neighbor Red Will Danaher (Victor McLagen), who covets the house himself. We learn a few Irish no-nos; such as you do not play patty fingers with the holy water. I will not go through the whole story as it is fun to watch it unfold. However there is a good example of horse sense as the horse knows to stop at the pub for Michaeleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) whom has a very dry throat.

The scenery gives the story a run for its money.

Note the stars are always for content as different media is mixed in the reviews.",1504828800,3,752,4.215277777777778

Personally, this movie ranks high on my list with the Wayne/O'Hara partnership (like 'McLintock'). When several family members cannot understand the dialog it greatly lessens the viewing experience and causes frustration for everyone. It is somewhat appalling to think with all of the time and money invested in improving the visual quality, that they would ignore the audio aspect. Considering so many older movies have had CC and/or subtitles added to Blu-ray versions, there is no excuse for not including them in this classic.",1495152000,2,622,5.23

While the pre-movie credits were shown, we should have heard music,especially that Irish tune they played during the Wayne-McLaglen fight thru the countryside.

I read the comments by others about the Blue Ray version and thought I was going to be getting a version with sparkling color and re-mastered in widescreen. It was not. The colors are muddy and the format is standard TV screen not widescreen. I was very disappointed because this is a great movie and I had just watched the DVD version that was horribly pixelated. By comparison this Blue Ray looks great. But it doesn't NOT have the brilliant color and gleaming wood work as seen in McClintock.

455611,5,6302320488,"I still maintain that this is the best John Wayne movie and definitely the best John Ford movie but, then, I'm a romantic.  It has romance, comedy, drama, action and intrigue.  Amazing so much can be put in such a fairly unknown movie.  The big treat is the Irish cast, many that went on to have long careers as support and character actors.  John Ford said it was his 'favorite' movie which he won the Best Director Oscar.  If you don't know who John Ford is, he won six Oscars (four for Best Director which is still the record) and directed 10 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances which does not include John Wayne (shocking)!  He directed The Searchers which received NO Academy Award nominations even though today it is ranked in or near the top 10 movies ever made on most lists. Also, he lost in 1939 for Stagecoach when Victor Fleming won for Gone with the Wind (a famous blockbuster) and in 1952 for The Quiet Man when Cecil B DeMille won for The Greatest Show on Earth (another big blockbuster).

If you watch this movie, you'll probably watch it more than once.  I've seen it at least 30 times in the past 40 years. It never grows old.",1490572800,,1157,4.476190476190476

was one of the first two DVD purchases I made.  Unfortunately, playing the DVD in
my Blu-Ray player on the new widescreen LCD was a great let down.  Distortion in
the video ruined the experience.  There are many reasons for this.  Do the research
if you wish.

So decided to give this a try.  Much better!  This is the way to go over the DVD.

But, who in the heck is Olive Films?  This presentation is not as exciting as the
originally restored DVD movie was on the old 27 inch Magnavox.  The color is good,
but has lost something in the translation and perhaps it could have been better.  The
picture is brighter but not as sharp.

The usual characters are included in the cast that you will see in so many of John Ford's movies with John Wayne. Each character is richly developed and faceted and the story line is lively, fun, intriguing, cultural and you feel like you are right there in Ireland with them. I keep the captions on because I don't always understand the Irish brogue but love hearing it. If I remember correctly, most of the outside shots are on location in Ireland and most of the inside shots were filmed back in Hollywood. I love this movie and have watched it so many times that I lost track of the count. Color me, an old movie lover.

This is my favorite movie I have a copy that has been around the world many times when I travel.some years back I was in Galway not far from ashford castle where a lot of filming on the picture was done. I found out in Galway a newspaper had original black and white photos of the cast and grounds during filming . When I meet the Girl at the front desk she said they did have proofs for  sale. She asked if I had a thing for Maurine O Hera I said yes . She said she was there in the building and asked if I would like to meet her .she introduced me to her and I asked if she would marry me . She was not the real Mary Kate in the movie but her name was Maurine O Hera . I said if I ever ran into her I was going to ask here to marry me so I did . We have a date when I return she going to take me on

455879,4,6302320488,"BOTTOM LINE: A daring change-of-pace role for The Duke that sees him ranging far outside his normal fields of duty on the battlefield or in the saddle, but which nonetheless remains a uniquely John Wayne film. Certainly a beautiful-looking movie, filmed almost entirely on location in the lush green rolling hills of Ireland. Give it a chance and I think you'll enjoy it. 4 STARS.

THE STORY: John Wayne portrays a retired prize fighter who turns his back on the sport after unintentionally killing an opponent while in the ring. He abandons his comfortable life in the US, returning to his native birthplace of Ireland, where he hopes to disappear and live out his remaining days in peace and anonymity. Shortly upon arriving however, he makes some enemies among the local well-to-do, and also falls head over heels for a feisty, fiery red-headed gal. It all comes to a head in the final act and the Duke must battle not only a stubborn local bigwig but ultimately his own inner demons if he hopes to find a lasting inner & outer peace.

THOUGHTS: I'd never seen THE QUIET MAN until I purchased this new Blu-ray. It's a terrific little film. One that many aficionados of the Duke have likely never heard of. His tough guy roles & movies are far more well-known. But like the wonderful and equally atypical film HATARI!, his reflective work here in THE QUIET MAN is surprisingly good, deserving of at least one viewing from everyone who considers themselves a true John Wayne fan. The movie is a personal favorite of both Wayne and his long-time friend and collaborator, director John Ford. The film looks gorgeous, with several sweeping vistas of the rugged verdant beauty of the famed Emerald Isle on full display. Top notch supporting cast acting aids the feel of the film, with especially solid turns by stunningly sexy Maureen O'Hara and frequent Wayne co-star Ward Bond, as the rascally local priest. Those who consider John Wayne as nothing more than a swaggering one-note lunk with little to recommend outside his westerns & WWII flicks need to pipe down and watch this movie. Some call it Wayne's best film, and I cannot argue much against their thinking. It's a damn shame that this didn't get as much airplay over the years as his other, more popular work.

THE BLU-RAY: You're not likely to see THE QUIET MAN look or sound better since the day it hit cinemas than it does here on this outstanding new hi-def release from Olive Films. All previous versions pale in comparison. The visual clarity is simply stunning. Like the recent hi-def release of Alfred Hitchcock's THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, the countrysides and location scenery on this Blu-ray edition of THE QUIET MAN are truly breath-taking to behold. Like watching a moving picture postcard. Wow. Sound is also clear, clean and crisp. No hissing, pops or crackles to annoy the ear. Bonus content is minimal but respectable, most notably a 30 minute retrospective ""Making of"" piece, hosted by noted film historian Leonard Maltin. The film's theatrical trailer is also included. I'm sure glad I bought a copy. It's one of Wayne's most daring departures from his usual fare, and I think it's in the top five of his all-time best.",1471132800,5,3193,4.801818181818182

I was shocked at how nasogastric it was. When he drags her off the train and drags her--sometimes pulling her along the ground--miles home, I could barely watch it. In fact, I turned it off. Wayne was actually abusive. And the whole town is watching and cheering this humiliation and cruelty on. It was repulsive, and it makes me sad...no, it's frightens me to think that less than 65 years ago, this kind of treatment of another human being was considered acceptable, and was a part of the culture at the time. I am sorry I spent any money on it at all.

On top of all that, it's just silly and stupid. The dialogue is ridiculous and sophomoric. The plot is shallow.",1466553600,2,860,4.36875

455926,5,6302320488,"My brief review will simply address the quality of the Blu-ray disc 60th Anniversary Special Edition, ""remastered in HD from a 4K scan of the original negative,"" by Olive Films. The color, clarity, and sound quality is stunning. Every little detail is crystal clear. I had the 40th Anniversary edition, and it was blurry to the point of almost being unwatchable on larger TV screens. This one is wonderful. The aspect ratio is 1:37:1, which means you'll have a wide, vertical black band on either side of the screen with the film in the middle. This also comes with the 28 minute documentary ""The Making of the Quiet Man"" narrated by Lenard Maltin.  So glad that I ordered this version from Olive Films.",1466380800,4,703,4.715447154471545

I grew up in the 40's and 50's and I know that it was not the norm for husbands and wives to push each other around and hit each other nor drag them across a field for any reason!  I have been married for 54 years and this has never happened in my marriage either.

456135,5,6302320488,"This movie is great.  The cast is strong to the point of being iconic.  The director is also iconic.  The movie was shot at the height of John Wayne's career.  Maureen O'Hara is the perfect co-star.

The cast includes co-stars from other John Wayne movies that, to me at least, resembles an ensemble.  I would refer a viewer to the movie Fort Apache.  Fort Apache is the first of a so called ""calvalry trilogy"" that serves as an example of this ensemble.

The movie is based on a short story ""The Quiet Man"" written by Maurice Walsh.  This short story is part of a larger series of connected short stories by the same author.  I really enjoy comparing movies to the literature the movie is based on.  Sometimes I prefer one, sometimes the other.  As great as this movie is, I think the book is even better.

There are significant changes in the movie from the short story.  This, of course, is common.  The result is a great movie of hilgh entertainment.  If one is a reader, as I am, the book is even more enjoyable, even to the point of being profound.",1453161600,,1054,4.383419689119171

We have seen this movie at least 20 times over the last few years and never get tired of it. Now instead of watching TV reruns, hubby asks me to pop in 'The Quiet Man' and we settle in to watch what we both feel is the best John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movie made.

456259,5,6302320488,One of my favorite John Wayne movies.  Have been to Ireland and seen some of the places used in the movie.  I never tire of looking at it.,1446681600,,138,3.892857142857143
456260,5,6302320488,"#1 in Westerns? Iwo Jima is west of the US, so I suppose that makes ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" a Western, too.

My problem with John Wayne films is, and always will be, John Wayne. This is one of his less-poor performances. The otherwise exceptionally fine script doesn't give him much to do dramatically, and he succeeds very well at not doing it. Maureen O'Hara, who passed on just 16 days ago (a shock, as I assumed she was immortal), is the real star.

I've seen ""The Quiet Man"" at least twice before, but was never so impressed with it. The casting is perfect, the script a model of engaging storytelling, and Ford's direction never better. It is a masterfully entertaining film.

It won Best Color Cinematography, but you'd never know it from the miserable prints commonly shown -- dark and muddy, with blocked shadows. If you're worried that this edition will be more of the same -- don't be. It's a 4K scan from the original three-strip Technicolor negatives, and it is magnificent. The rich detail of the Irish countryside is realistic and seductive. The color is generally excellent, but skin tones don't always look natural, and bright colors too-often ""pop"" in a way not intended. The rendering of red as magenta that occurs in ""Pinocchio"" also occurs here. * But the excessive contrast and blocked shadows are gone. ""The Quiet Man"" finally achieves its intended beauty.

The only supplemental material is a 1992 ""gush"" from Leonard Maltin, about the making of the film. (Yes, the sound and image are out of sync.)  It includes excerpts from the original trailer (and film) that show how much this electronic transfer has improved the image.

Strongly recommended.

* Technicolor films were intended to be viewed as Technicolor IB prints -- not in a direct electronic transfer.",1446681600,,1782,4.822950819672132
456261,1,6302320488,"The 1 star rating is for the bluray product only.
Why, why, why didn't olive studios provide English subtitles for the Deaf/Hard of hearing?
Also, they assume the whole world is proficient in Irish phonics.
The heavy Irish accented dialogue, plus their native slang, is enough to drive a non-Irish
speaking listener coconuts.
The film itself deserves a 4 star rating.
It is set in a bygone time, when life was simpler and kinder.
The Irish landscapes and villages were a charm to behold. John Wayne, Maureen O'hara
and the supporting cast put in a marvelous act to make this an evergreen romantic movie magic.
Maureen, who passed away a few weeks ago, will be dearly missed.
This movie will always remind me of the grandeur, greatness and enigma of the old Hollywood
era of the 40's, 50's, and even the 60's.
No modern film maker can even come close to producing such romantic era films of that time period.
Anyway, why no English subtitles, mr.olive studios? Why stinge on this provision?

Even keeping in mind that this was made in the 1950's it's chock full of stereotypes--alcoholism, bad tempers, etc-- in a pretty thin story that goes on too long.  The worse part was that John Wayne's character is the most stable person in the town and he spends half the movie pushing, dragging and slapping Maureen O'Hara's character--and he likes her!  Yuck!

He is criticized as playing one part, himself. But this movie took him out of that box and showed a side that he had no one knew. It's out of the westerns and war movie genre. He has dones movies outside westerns and war, but this one stands out because of the depth of this movie. John Ford brings out the best of actors with his harsh direction. And John Wayne shows that. With Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond, you have a cast directors yearn for. This movie and story will touch anyone's heart who loves the movies. I'd give 6 stars for this movie if I could. It is done magnificently. My only complaint would be the actual quality of the film itself. The color is not great but aside from that, it is perfect.

Had it on VHS , regular DVD , and now blue ray .
Was surprised how bad the DVD  color and clarity is , but this blue ray is nice .
More surprised by the aspect ratio . The others were widescreen , and I remember seeing an added feature about it being widescreen and the scene at the train station , that you could see more of the train and the horse wander off . Anybody else who saw this please enlighten me .
Anyway , great movie , story and characters .",1438387200,,487,3.8217821782178216
456734,4,6302320488,"The color is markedly better than the 2002 Artisan DVD which can have very dense colors that seem ""off"" at times;  also some sections of the 2002 DVD are so dense that little detail is visible.  However, there are no subtitles which are really appreciated by those of us whose hearing is diminishing -  especially for dealing with Irish brogue.  Also, at the end of the film is a lovely section in which the actors take ""curtain calls.""  In the original, the names of the actors being pictured are presented like subtitles.  However, these are missing in this Blu-ray and were also missing in the 2002 Artisan DVD, which is a shame.  Unless you know about the original intent of this section, it makes no sense at all!  Given the effort to make the Blu-Ray to improved the detail and correct the color, it would seem that the issue of subtitles and the names of the actors could have been addressed - this lack results in my downgrading what could have been a 5 rating to a 4.",1438214400,2,976,4.443820224719101

456766,5,6302320488,"The accomplishment in making this film is not so much the story of Ireland or the plot of a prize-fighter going back to quiet roots, but of a creation of a hopeful family community where everyone is knit into a group.  The rough parts of the film -- John Wayne dragging Maureen O'Hara over miles of fields, a very rough and forced kiss, and the woman who offers a stick to beat the pretty lady -- are still just as rough and should never be emulated, ever, but these parts were never a description of a world that should be, rather a break from tension into the imaginary world that should be, and that should-be world seems to have been cultivated by the family group as they made the film.  John Wayne's daughters are in the film, Maureen O'Hara's brothers, the actor who played ""Michaeleen Flynn"" is brother to the one that plays the Protestant minister, John Ford's brother plays the village elder.  This film does not portray Ireland, as a place, but creates a make-believe world where people can really come home to family and security.  The color is beautiful.  Many interesting background views on making the film, which I have mentioned without citation here -- nothing I say is original.  It is a great film regardless of what anyone says, but it helps me to view this as an exercise in imagination, not just a Hollywood story told in scenery (it is Hollywood, of course, but what Hollywood can do well when it tries).",1437004800,,1428,4.55859375

There is much to be said about the movie itself.  First, it is John Ford's homage to Ireland.  Second, it is John Ford directing John Wayne, always an awesome combination.  Third, it is the second pairing of Wayne with Maureen O'Hara, always an awesome combination.  Add in the beautiful countryside of Ireland and the usual selection of stock players, you have the ingredients for a good movie.  Throw in an extremely well written tale and you have great cinema.  The dialogue is sharp. The plot never drags or stutters.  The capper though is that great fight scene the crowns the movie.",1436832000,3,761,4.654135338345864

I loved his work as a cowboy and soldier hero but this one struck home with me as to how well he adapted to ""modern"" movies; as a boxer, soldier and leader of ""The Flying Tigers"", et al, from and with his work as a cowboy hero.  I love that his movies are all clean with ""hell"" or ""damn"" being the extent of vulgar language.  ""The Quiet Man"" is reputed to have the longest fight scene in movies, even to this day.  If I am wrong, please pardon my info being outdated"".  His movies with Maureen O'Hara are my personal favorites of ALL movies ever made.  They had that chemistry together that made their roles seem real and relevant, even today.  I wish he could have lived longer to continue his legacy as the hero that a lot of men should look up to in their lifestyle.  He wasn't a saint in real life, but he was a saint compared to some of those who consider themselves actors today.

From vhs to dvd to FINALLY blu-ray, I have waited for the clarity that the blu-ray disc offers me for The Quiet man. No longer do I have to contend with an overly fuzzy picture or with the audio/visual not in sync. I finally have a version that is as clear as I can imagine, yet retains the warmth and love that John Ford put into it. From white o'morn to cohans in the village of Cong where it was shot, you will be hard pressed to find a better restoration. A+",1422662400,4,540,4.0092592592592595

457318,5,6302320488,"I bought this for my wife who is my Irish classic: it's her favorite movie. I like it because it's a John Wayne movie, and John Wayne was a stand up guy. He had a great group of fellow artists in his ""company"" whom he was loyal to and who you saw in most of his movies. And he was an unabashed conservative in a town full of left wing jackoffs who fill the theaters with slanted garbage they try to pass off as entertainment.  with that in mind -- If any of you run across Michael Moore in an airport, mall, or gas station, please give him a swift kick in the groin...hard enough to make his ear lobes bulge out.

While not super-super-crisp HD quality, this version of the movie is definitely a solid rendition of the original. An additional bonus feature, ""The Making Of The Quiet Man,"" looks a lot fuzzier and grainier in comparison, but it well worth watching too. (Guess whose relatives made it into the picture? :) This ""Making Of"" feature had several short clips of the film that looked like they were copied from an old VHS tape of a noisy original, but thankfully the film itself seems to be completely free of such problems. Colors are bright, faces are clear, sound is good, and the film is great. I'm not sure the quality of the transfer could get much better than this. It IS the 60th Anniversary Edition, after all. 4 stars for this version's quality, and 5 stars for the film itself. :)",1420416000,,1027,4.679558011049724

457383,5,6302320488,"I crossed my fingers when I ordered this release of the Quiet Man as there are dozens, if not 100's, of reviews of the various releases of this great movie...a great many being bitter criticisms of the 'poor,' 'shameful,' 'disappointing,' 'abysmal' video quality of the digital remastering job.  Unfortunately, many - if not all - of these critiques have found their way onto the page advertising this particular edition, thus creating a great deal of confusion because the edition being critiqued is not adequately described.
This review is here to tell you that THIS is the one to buy -- both video and audio are superb.  The tell-tale clue is that the dates on the poor reviews are all from 2004-2006, but this edition was released on January 22, 2013.  Just be sure that you are purchasing the Olive Films release (OF483) and you won't be disappointed.
It would behoove Amazon to remove any review from this release of the Quiet Man that pre-dates 2013 and assign it to the release to which it belongs.
As an aside, I remember when this 1952 production was released -- except no one knew for months that it was a movie.  All anyone knew was that thousands of posters and flyers began appearing, saying ""The Quiet Man is Coming"" -- nothing else.  Kids were enlisted to tack them onto walls, fences, telephone poles, etc.  It had people talking for weeks on end about who/what is this 'Quiet Man' thing?!  Masterful promotion idea!  :^D",1420329600,14,1438,4.724

I won't bother commenting on the film itself, its one of John Waynes best work, and many of the other reviews cover the content.  I just wish to report on the quality of the copy.  Its by far the best re-production Ive ever seen.  I paid $17 for the blue ray copy and feel it was a good investment.

One of the reasons I loved them so much is you always got the rough and tough cowboy or soldier but he a lot of times brought the tenderness and compasion to his characters. The Quiet Man is one of those. A great story of man that lived a violent life in the boxing ring and through a tragedy was determined to turn his life around and live a peaceful life among the people of his ancestry in Ireland. It is beutifully filmed and with this blu-ray edition it makes it almost like your seeing it for the first time. Even if your not a big John Wayne fan, the movie stands alone as a great film.

457638,5,6302320488,"This is, hands down, my favorite John Wayne Film.  I love his westerns - they are classics - but this one shows a side of his acting ability that isn't highlighted often.  In contradiction to the reviews that say otherwise, my copy looks beautiful.  The remastering looks perfect to me.  I have the VHS and this DVD looks better than the original VHS and the original movie if TV broadcasts are any indication of the condition of the original film.  That is all anyone can ask for. The limitations of film in the 1950s was significant and no amount of remastering is going to change that.  You can raise the pixel quality and repair holes and damage, but digital remastering can't make a movie filmed in 1952 look like it was filmed yesterday with current digital film technology.  Those that think it can have unrealistic expectations.  You can make the existing image better but you cannot fix what wasn't there to begin with.",1412726400,,928,4.6503067484662575

It's always hard to judge a classic since cinematography was so different then as was their idea of what was funny, normal etc.  We meant to watch it before going to Ireland where much of it is filmed.  After staying in Cong and visiting Ashford Castle, seeing the museum, bridge, etc. we said we have to watch this!  Highlight for me was seeing Pat Cohen's Pub.  We sat exactly where the camera had been positioned.  And we had fun pointing out anything we saw in the museum.

They are lovey-dovey until her brother (Victor McLaughlin, brutish, burley, one evolutionary step away from Neanderthal Man) refuses to give her her dowry.

Thus ensues filmdom's greatest fight. Fisticuffs at its finest. McLaglen and Wayne battle over hill 'n dale, thru bars, barns and haystacks. The entire village (including the town's clerics) is betting on the outcome . . .",1410048000,,649,5.065420560747664

sheep looking as UN-tameable as the wind swept landscape. Excellent Ward Bond. Beautifully filmed and plot has dark
secret which has driven our hero, John Wayne, away from the Pennsylvania coal town where he grew up.  He butts heads
with Irish customs and sparks fly into a rousing fisticuffs where nearly the entire male population joins in a rousing brawl
along the roads and across town.

We watched this DVD and were qute pleased because it looked so much better than the VHS tape I had of the film, taped from one of the classic movie channels in the 1990s.  The film has probably not looked this well since it was released in 1952.

The special bonus feature, hosted by Leonard Maltin, is quite interesting too.  There's no question that this was one of John Wayne's greatest films and I think it benefited from the excellent cast, as well as the Oscar-winning cinematography, the lovely musical score by Victor Young, and, of course, John Ford's outstanding direction.

John Ford's film never seems small (how could it be with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara at its center?), but this is a lovely character-driven film. Wayne is at his peak here. commanding every frame and never over-doing it. O'Hara's the heart of soul of this movie, and the chemistry between these two stars is right up there with any great screen duo you care to mention. Barry Fitzgerald is charm personified as the friend who engineers their love story, and Victor McLaughlin (a Ford regular) is outstandingly unlikable as the O'Hara's pain-in-the-arse brother. Ireland's scenery is in its glory here. All the local characters are charmingly captured, not for the cliches, but for the color they bring to these roles. Both stars are Oscar-worthy and it's a pity they didn't win. No matter, this is a lovely film to be savored over and over again.",1404604800,2,982,4.649425287356322

This is Duke Wayne in a classic leading man role - but worry not, John Ford doesn't forget his core audience.  Snappy dialogue (in the brogue), barenuckle fisticuffs and hard drinking abound.  Those familiar with the work of Ford and Wayne know well the enjoyment of sharing in the unmistakebly genuine affection that bind together this fine ensemble of actors, their director and the audience.

It is a 5 star rating.  However, I gave this a 1 star rating because the only special feature on it is a documentary hosted by a very young looking Leonard Maltin from a much older DVD (2002?) and it looks awful by comparison.  Miss O'Hara's commentary  is missing as well as two or three other features from a previous DVD version which is a crime by my standards.  This film is a classic by many people in the industry as well as the public and for some reason they did not include these other features.  This is not a rare thing as other DVD's I have are changed when the Blu Ray version comes out so I have to keep the DVD if I ever want to see those again.  Many people don't ever watch the extras on DVD's etc. but I do and its a shame since there is so much to talk about.",1400284800,5,938,3.925925925925926

I have owned several versions of the DVD of this movie, hoping each new release would be the definitive cleaned version (but they are all the same: terrible).  The color in these old DVDs is so horribly washed out and blurred that I really felt as if I would never see the true version of the film.  It was like looking at Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling covered in 400 years of candle smoke and prior botched restorations.  These earlier DVDs were scans of bad transfers, probably from the VHS days, replicated over and over, degrading with each new transfer (if it says Artisan on the back cover, you know what I mean). There was no love for the movie until this release.  And what a difference.  Wow.

From the opening scene to the final credits, it's as if this is a completely different movie.  And what a new movie.  This is terrific.  I have to give cudos to OliveFilms for taking the time and putting in the effort to get this right.  It looks great.",1397865600,11,1049,4.439790575916231

I love this movie with Maureen O'Hara. She to me makes this film great. I don't feel that any other woman could of done this character as well as she did. I feel that she accents John Wayne in a couple of his movies. This movie is about John Wayne being a ex boxer. He stopped boxing, because he killed another boxer in the ring. He decide to go to Ireland where he was born and was going to stay for the rest of his life. He see this young woman Maureen O'Hara and he falls in love with her. Its a very rocky relationship from the start. She isn't the easiest person to be around. He does marry her, but even their marriage is rocky. Her brother is always trying to fight him, but John doesn't fight, because he always thinks of the other boxer that died. In the end he does fight him and all the towns people follow them and take bets as to who was going to win.

The wonderful cast and their acting bring this film to life. One wants to visit Kon Ireland just to see the cottage that was the center piece of this story. ( The cottage still exists!)

The first was a VHS version, the second the DVD, John Wayne Collection ISBN 0-7820-1057-1 version and now this Olive Films Blu-ray one. The reason I purchased this last copy is that the DVD copy has a very poor resolution even though the colors are vibrant. The new Olive Films version while having a much improved resolution has issues with colors. I believe there is an over saturation of the reds and blues but an under saturation of the greens resulting in a washout look.

458076,5,6302320488,"Director, John Ford, is mostly known for his great westerns, but his reverence of Irish culture clearly shows through in ""The Quiet Man"".  Shot on location in 1952, this film is a snapshot of an Ireland that no longer exists - where Gaelic was spoken and nary a car could be seen - only horse-drawn carriages.  Ford's masterpiece gave John Wayne perhaps his most iconic role, placing him in a bygone Ireland where most of the homes still had thatched roofs and a girl had to have the permission of the man of the house to be courted.  If you're lucky enough to be of Irish descent, you must not miss this film.

The characters in this film are incredible and the effort that John Ford made to secure the rights to the film and then prepare for the film are legendary.  In fact, Ford even went to the great extent of making a few films under the studio's budget mixing actors he had in mind for ""His"" Quiet Man before eventually making the film on his own. He wanted to be sure that all of them would mix well on the long journey in Ireland.  We know most of the lines in the film by heart now.  We eventually went to Ireland in 2000 and fell in love with the people and the country. We plan to go back again and retrace the film locations of this truly wonderful film.  A film like this makes one want to live in a time and place such as this....

I have never seen this movie look this good! Beautiful full colors, excellent sound! I'm realizing that I'd only ever seen washed out, edited copies on TV.

458130,5,6302320488,"I am not sure why Amazon saw fit to lump all the DVD reviews in with the Blu-Ray version, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this review. What is to the point, at least from my perspective, is this Blu-ray version is the anti-DVD. The claim is this Blu-ray of The Quiet Man comes from a 4K scan of an original print. I can say this is very much the truth, and what it means for you is it will feel like you are there when you watch it.

The quality is both the best and worst that technology has to offer. When I read the claim of a 4K scan my first thought was but one word : overkill. It wasn't until roughly 1970 that movie film had enough 'grain' that - more or less - it matched what later became the HD standard we all know today. That being said, the 4K scan put absolutely the maximum amount of resolution that will ever be possible to obtain from an original print of The Quiet Man. The only way to get better from this point is to process the 4K scan via software and somehow auto-magically remove the grain.

Sadly, this means the images on your HD television will both be the highest resolution of The Quiet Man you have ever seen, and 'grainy' at the same time. In other words, don't expect to sit close to your HD TV expecting to ferret out minute details you never noticed before. You WILL see the grain of the original film coming through at all times.

Assuming you are not sitting within eighteen inches of your HD TV, what you WILL see is the most beautiful, vibrant and beautiful movie that is possible at this point. There are details that were never possible to see with the slipshod 'transfers' that have been made up to now with VHS and DVDs. I have a VHS of a taping from TV and one of the DVDs, so  I know of whence I speak when I say :

If you are a fan of The Quiet Man and you have yet to purchase the Blu-ray version, you are missing out.

Isn't that the best possible reason to purchase this Blu-ray version? I am so glad I purchased it, because it was like watching a The Quiet Man for the very first time, all over again. I really can't think of a higher complement than that.

The bottom line is if you don't add The Quiet Man Blu-ray to your collection, more is the pity for you.",1395187200,10,2233,4.1077981651376145

458194,5,6302320488,"I am not a 100% full on ""old movie buff,"" but for some reason no matter how many times I watch this flick I find myself smiling at the sweetness of it.  Too bad, that back in the day, they could not film the whole movie.  There is a missing piece at the beginning when Sean Thornton (John Wayne) is thrown an apple from someone on the train.  There was supposed to be a prologue with him and a teach talking, but they did not have the time.  Watching the special features you learn that they were told 100 minutes no more and no less, so they staged a filming for the movie company execs and stopped it at 100 minutes which left out the final 8 minutes of the movie.  I will not ruin such a grand movie for you, but the last 8 minutes are the best.
This is the only movie I have seen where John Wayne is acting, he is not playing ""John Wayne"" and is in fact applying his craft as an actor.  The fact that you forget it is John Wayne through all of the movie makes this his best performance ever.  I am not a John Wayne fan, but this is my all time number 1 favorite movie and it became so when I first saw it at 22 years old about 10 years ago.  Visually it is colorful and stunning for its age and the script is spot on to get you into the sweet little irish community he moves to.
A must see for movie buffs in my humble opinion.  I would have purchased it as a streaming movie if available when i purchased, but the DVD and packaging is great and I will always treasure owning this movie.",1394064000,,1491,3.976510067114094

Been to the film's locations, 60 years on, not much has changed, with all the charm, and beauty of a time gone still vivid, as one can imagine the church scene, fight scene, and so on, whilst standing at each place.

458330,4,6302320488,"I understand there are so many old films literally falling apart because the film they are on is made of nitrocellulose which is only stable for a certain period ..... if I was rich, I would be involved with something like that. You would think that with a classic movie like this, someone would have done a digital touchup/remake but apparently not. The product reviews on Amazon of the anniversary edition and the blu-ray edition and in fact, all the editions from that one company, suggested that they were terrible and a sham. I will just have to keep my fingers crossed that someone will salvage it soon. I am a John Wayne fan. If you will read a little about the man, you will see that his father was a pharmacist ...... they had to move to California from a midwestern town due to the father having a lung condition. Wayne came from modest means. Playing football for USC, luck turned his way when Tom Mix got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for some football tickets. He met John Ford (whose real name was Irish) and they hit it off. The rest is history. Many didn't like Wayne's conservative political stance, but my readings show him to be a generous man who told the
truth as he saw it. He didn't take himself too seriously. When asked to run for President of the US, he declined, sayin he didn't think the American people would take an actor too seriously. As for the characters he played, every actor has to have an identifiable and likable personality ...... a schtick as it were. Wayne's was forward and pushy but his roles called for ""hero types"" ........ not trembling cowards. I fought a 40 year addiction to cigarettes ...... when I came along, everybody smoked including my doctor. I'm glad the young people today know the perils of smoking and the officials of our country should never give up on emphasizing the negative effects of all drugs. Apparently,Wayne could not control the cigarettes and they are probably the cause of his death. Maureen O'Hara ........ I love women and I fell in love with her the first time I saw her ........ and I love redheads. I saw where she revisited Ireland a few years ago at the age of 90, I believe. She seemed afraid. I am in my 60's now and getting old sucks. Watching good people, ....... pretty people ...... people with manners and character, get old is like watching your parents or yourself getting old. Sad. The quality of this dvd is not up to a good VHS but its apparently all that is available. Chances are, it was copied from a VHS so if you can find it on a good condition VHS tape, you might be better off. Not much definition ........ you have to crank the volume up ....... and in a couple of places for a very short time, the characters move too fast like an old black and white Charley Chaplain film. Still, what are you going to do ? I love this movie so much, I would buy/watch it in almost any condition. This is a feel good movie ..... you feel better after you've watched it than you did before.

This 60th Aniversary Special Edition is a Heart Breaker to. The transfer was ok, the colors and the skin tones real,
the fabric on the clothes even looked perfect and then the bottom fell out.
Right after John Wayne and Maureen O'hara tie the knot the scene where Victor McLaglen discovers he was duped
was cut along with the punch that starts the whole thing and when they go to his cottage through the Duke in his sleeping
bag the next morning. All that was eliminated and to top it off it skips where the splice was made to continue the movie.
Do not waste you're money on this product unless you enjoy being ripped of. I am contacting Maureen O'hara who is still
alive and am going to initiate public outrage that this is being done to us. If this is not corrected this timeless classic will

I'm not going to review the movie like so many others do.  What a waste of time.  Also, Amazon lumps all reviews for the same movie into a single set of reviews, so the VHS reviews are considered the same as DVDs and Blu-rays, etc.

There have been so many complains in these reviews as to the remaster quality, but they don't say what version, so I had to take a gamble that this was a quality one.

Pro
The remaster is excellent.  Crystal clear.

Con
The aspect ratio was a disappointment at old 4:3 (standard TV) as opposed to widescreen.  That was enough to drop a star.

Again, this is not dropping a star because of the movie, we love the movie.",1388966400,2,709,4.3106060606060606

Not much in terms of special featues, extras, etc. There's better stuff on the DVD releases. But the film itself is GREAT! You won't be sorry if you buy this one.

458570,5,6302320488,"Beautifully photographed in Technicolor, with a host of mostly Irish stars and character actors, The Quiet Man was John Ford's love letter to his ancestral Ireland, written on a picture postcard. Toiling at the time for Republic Pictures, turning out western movie after western movie, Ford ached to return to Ireland to film what he referred to as ""the Irish story"". But location shooting in Ireland would be expensive, and Republic wanted Ford to continue with the money-making westerns he was directing, which are now considered to be among the best of the genre. So Republic offered a deal: do another western for us, and we'll back the Irish story. That western was the classic Rio Grande.

In The Quiet Man, John Wayne is a native son returning to Ireland to find the tranquility of his birthplace and leave behind a boxing tragedy in his past. Maureen O'Hara is a (genuine) red-haired Irish girl with whom he is smitten at first sight. But she has a loud and aggressive brother, played by Victor McLaglen, who objects to any marriage with a ""Yank"". A widespread conspiracy is needed to hoodwink McLaglen into allowing the marriage, and includes not only townsfolk, but also the Catholic Priest (Ward Bond) and the Protestant Reverend (Arthur Shields). Barry Fitzgerald is the official matchmaker, and the driver of the Jaunting Car in the iconic courting scene. But of course all of this is building up to a fight between Wayne the reluctant boxer, and McLaglen the bullying blowhard.

Infused with not only skill, but love of the homeland, The Quiet Man turned out to be one of Ford's best. It was also one of John Wayne's best, and without doubt the finest of his several films with Maureen O'Hara. It was a nepotistic family affair, with Ford's brother and son-in-law, O'Hara's two brothers, and Wayne's four children all playing roles. The biggest role, ""relatively"" speaking, was that of Barry Fitzgerald's younger brother (Arthur Shields) who played the Protestant Reverend in the overwhelmingly Catholic town of Innisfree. Ford's brother Francis' role was as the aged, bearded townsman who, surrounded by weeping womenfolk and a Catholic priest, leaps out of his deathbed and runs down the street to witness the donnybrook between Wayne and McLaglen.

The Olive Films Blu-ray is typical in every way, featuring video that is vastly superior to the DVD version, good sound, a sparse selection of special features, and no subtitles. So keep the DVD for its extras, especially the commentary by Maureen O'Hara, and luxuriate in the color and clarity of the Blu-ray edition.",1379548800,4,2584,4.990719257540603
458571,5,6302320488,"This restoration by Olive films is simply unbelievable.  Since the three (black and white negative) strip technicolor masters exist, a complete remastering was possible.

I did this using a 53 inch Sony edge lit LCD TV and an up-scaling Sony Blu Ray DVD player.  The difference at every level is amazing.  Clarity of image -- the standard DVD looked like a video tape transfer and had very soft details (at times almost blurred). The blu ray detail showed hair, details of brick, etc.  There was no comparison with respect to color quality.  The blu ray colors sparkled with the very bright, vivid reds that one expects with technicolor.  The blu ray version was generally brighter than the standard version.  I did not detect a major difference in sound between the two versions.  If you have a reasonably large TV screen the blu ray will provide a much more satisfying experience.  If you love this movie, as I do, and re watch it with any regularity, the blu ray version is worth buying even if you have purchased earlier DVD versions.",1377216000,19,994,4.634285714285714

No, but like I said this is one of my favorite movies.  Is it worth it?  It was for me, the colors are great, and you almost feel like you are in Ireland, especially the rainstorm scene.  Are the differences that significant? Not really, but they are better.  Basically, just depends on whether you feel like spending some more money.

458691,5,6302320488,"The Quiet Man is in my opinion John Ford's greatest film, thus, one of the best films ever made. As well as the direction being perfect, this is also the case with the casting, the acting, the screen play, the music and the photography. It was the second time the world saw Ford's own personal and philosphical affinity with the very Un-British Gaelic community of the British Isles, but while Ford gritted his coal-blackened teeth to do the ( on balance ) more dour How Green was my Valley, here he revels in the pure delights of a near blarnified tale set in an idyll that was always going to wow the American and worldwide market, perhaps more so than the rest of the British Isles.

So, the story itself, Mother and child leave Ireland to go the USA, mother fills son's head with nostalgic tales of the village of his birth, boy grows up, becomes a professional boxer, kills a man during a bout, leaves the ring behind to return to Ireland, falls for the red haired beauty with temper to match. Hereonin, old and modern clash and this sets up the bulk of the remainder of the film.

The screen play for this film was gleaned from a series of short stories, The Green Rushes, by Maurice Walsh, which had a more at times darker back drop of the infamous and ugly battle between the original IRA and the much reviled Black and Tans. Thankfully, Ford only allowed the briefest of undertones of this in the film, and even then such references are more comic than sinister.

There are many, many scenes and lines of dialogue which people recall again and again, here's my favourite. The local matchmaker / chaperon, played by Barry Fitzgerald, calls on Maureen O'Hara's character, he helps himself to an over generous glass of whiskey, and an alarmed Maureen O'Hara asks 'would you like water with that whiskey?' the reply? 'When I drink water I drink water, when I drink whiskey I drink whiskey'. And one more which is missed by many, really. The local widow ( or Minister's wife, can't remember now!) indulges in a gentle act of mockery / sarcasm when she says to John Waynes' character after refurbishing the cottage of his childhood, 'Who but an American would have thought of Emerald Green for a door.'

My own affinity with this film comes from the days, not that long ago really, before cable TV, internet or even 24 hour telly. The Quiet Man strongly featured on Christmas film listings, especially on Christmas Eve. Watching this with the fire blaring, the front room lit only by the Christmas Tree lights which then reflected on the streamers, made Christmases even more special.

There is only one downside, it is a tad long, I'm sure it could have been chopped by 20 minutes or so without loss of quality or impact, but, a very, very minor quibble.

Finally as someone who has no time for Westerns, I wish Mr Ford had never heard of them, if he had not, he may have been able to knock out other films inspired by his own Gaelic roots?",1369958400,,2944,4.534839924670433

458697,5,6302320488,"For me, John Ford's epic yet also intimate personal love letter to Ireland, THE QUIET MAN, is one of the great films of all time. I've only ever seen it on broadcast TV, VHS and the previous DVD release, and I was still enamored of the seeming over-saturation of color hues of the previous releases. But seeing it cleaned up, and removing some of that saturation has given a crisper, clearer and surprisingly more beautiful release on Blu-Ray.

However, my main issue with this release is that, for all the beauty it gives, it's taken out some of the bonus features that remained on the previous DVD release; the best of them being the commentary track by the thankfully not-departed Maureen O'Hara, arguably the most beautiful woman to have ever lived (at least in my mind). I don't know that if Republic or whatever company owned the previous version's rights, but this is a supplement that should absolutely be on this disc, as well as any other supplemental material they could have put out for one of the greatest films ever made.

It's still absolutely worth your money though.",1369094400,2,1083,4.724867724867725
458698,3,6302320488,"Having been away from home and my wife for three weeks, I was looking forward to watching John Ford's The Quiet Man.

John Wayne gets to show his more sensitive self, Ireland shows its green--welcome after the early Mediterranean browns of California's spring rather than the green spring of Iowa. Maureen O'Hara gets to show her feisty self to best advantage . . .

And I was moved by Wayne's interpretation of fighter Sean Thornton who has vowed to keep his fists out of the fight. And I did enjoy the green fields heavy with recent rain. (The Quiet Man was the first American major film to have footage shot in Ireland.) Maureen O'Hara was the ""fiery Mary Kate,"" damned if any man was going to tell her what to do and damned if she would love any man who wouldn't and couldn't.

It was the stereotypes that got to me: men violent to women and brawling as a pastime; drunkenness as a national pastime; smoking as the essence of virility. After a while, I had to enjoy the film in spite of its assumptions.

This film was released in the year of my birth. Thank god my growth and my generation's was away from many of the social beliefs of that time. We are a diverse world, and I'm glad to have that understanding as part of who I am. The Irish aren't all drunken brawlers any more than all Americans are violent, gun-packing mobsters.

The movie, though, has its sweet and humorous moments--it's just too bad that when Sean Thornton, aka John Wayne, finally has his epiphany, the resolution of the conflict is determined by who is the best brawler and boozer. With Irish music in the background.

And, yes, I did cry at times during the flick. I really miss my wife.",1368921600,,1669,4.4557377049180324

458756,5,6302320488,"Olive Films' release of John Ford's masterpiece, The Quiet Man, is a qualified success.  In comparison to the previous DVD release, there is nothing so annoying as to hamper anyone's enjoyment of the film.  In the previous version we had to deal with maddening scratches, reel change marks, and washed-out Technicolor.  If Technicolor is washed out in certain movies, it's done for aesthetic reasons (The Godfather, for example).  This new release displays on the whole brighter and more saturated color; it is unfortunate that the saturation comes at the cost of graininess, which is not a by-product of classic Technicolor processing.  While skies still look more pastel than deep blue, the improvement on the last version is palpable.  Of course, the ""risks"" of outdoor and/or location shooting include the capricious nature of the climate; Ireland is not immune to fogs, clouds, and rain. In such conditions, matching shots are especially difficult.  Take the horserace in this films, where wind and clouds threaten to limit takes and matching shots.  In the previous DVD, this scene is a nightmare: dark and light, sunny and cloudy. Carefully timed, the restorer can help mitigate extremes, but none of that is evident in the previous version.  Of course, for crucial scenes, Ford had to rely on matching the outdoor light in the studio, where he has optimum control.  One must remember that remastering is not the same thing as restoring.  A company like Criterion, working with universities and other organizations, must invest time and funding to accomplish the task of recreating the vision closest to the filmmakers.'

You can see where the townswoman hands Sean the switch and says, ""This is a good switch for spanking the lady."" and the next scene is Sean Throwing the switch away. Ridiculous political correctness! This movie was about a different society than today and made in 1952, please keep your damned political correctness to yourself, Olive Productions. In 2013 Sean could disembowel her onscreen but, not spank her.

Silliness.

I will not buy another Olive product, knowingly.",1366156800,,822,4.734265734265734

For the first time ever, interior scenes show the details that have always been lost in the shadows; the same is true for the scenes shot outdoors in the evening or the rain.  The clarity and vibrancy of the picture throughout the entire movie is simply phenomenal and the audio is crisp, clear and flawless.

A good old fashioned big Hollywood movie that has a great story line.  It is a very good movie, a little squirky in spots, but overall a great movie with a great plot.  Loved the scenery, and loved the acting.  It shows how men and women used to ""court"" each other many years ago.  There is also an extra feature about John Ford and making the movie.  I enjoyed watching that segment too.  Two great stars with John Wayne and Irish born Marleen O'Hare.

So we watched the blogs and waited. Our continued and cautious interest was rewarded with the announced re-re-re-release on Blu-Ray, ""..from the original negative"".

With the smell of previously purchased TQM DVD's rotting in the drawer, we decided to purchase one-more-time. With a short wait in the order queue, the 'The Holy Grail' Blu-Ray was finally delivered yesterday.

YUREKA my fellow TQM-freaks, John and Maureen have landed, complete with dandruff on the back of conductors jackets, individual hair strands dancing in the wind and spokes on the carriage wheels that actually can be counted. AND... OH MY GOD! 'Their' lips match the voice...

I can't tell you how remarkable it is to watch details and color that have been missing for so many years.  It was like watching this screen gem for the first time. I've got to believe that 'someone' ACTUALLY listened to our prayers to do 'this one' right. There are probably going to be ""issues"" found that I didn't notice the first time around.

Several days before St. Patrick's Day I was enjoying my annual viewing of this great movie in the Collector's Edition DVD (2002) and annoying grandmommie with my annual grumbling about the muddy colors, purple fringed trees, shadow landscapes, and blurry characters. I looked up some information about the movie using the IMDB app on my KFHD8.9 and happened to click on the link to Amazon. That's how I found out about this new edition available both on DVD and on Blu-ray. Sorting out the appropriate reviews from the mess Amazon creates by running together reviews of different products containing this movie, I immediately ordered the Blu-ray so I could watch it before March 17. It came overnight with free shipping thanks to Amazon Prime and the new Amazon distribution center a few miles up the road.

The Blu-ray 60th Anniversary Special Edition brings us a new Quiet Man, one that gives us the texture of the land, the costumes, and the faces of the actors. The colors are glorious (though I read this morning that the head of Republic Pictures complained that everything was green.)

458999,5,6302320488,"I saw this movie for the first time in 1975 at the age of 22 and immediately fell in love with Maureen O'Hara. Since then, I have bought several versions for my home theater, including the first VHS and the Collectors Edition DVD. All of them were huge disappointments. The video quality was so poor that it was painful to watch, even on a small TV. I have been waiting for a decent transfer for years. Finally, Olive Films has delivered a blu-ray version that is much better than any of the predecessors. It is a pleasure to watch on a big screen. By the way, my equipment is an OPPO BDP-93 blu-ray player, a Panasonic PT-AE4000U HD projector and a 150"" screen. True, being a non-native English speaker I miss the subtitles. I also miss the commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Of, course, there are ways and means to get around these problems, but this is not the time and place to discuss such issues. Furthermore, I am not sure that I would call it a perfect transfer, because there are still some minor issues, mostly in badly lit interior scenes. A couple of outdoor scenes seem to be overexposed, because especially the faces appear too light. But as a whole, the picture quality is really amazing. Some of the scenes are are so crisp and fresh that it is like being in Ireland yourself. So, while waiting for The Quiet Man to get the ultimate Criterion TLC treatment, this is a good choice.

I am not going to talk about the movie itself in any great detail. Others have done that much more eloquently than I can. But it was only now, watching it in high-definition on a big screen, that I realised that this is first and foremost Maureen O'Haras movie. She has the best scenes and some of the best lines, and the camera clearly loves her. The auburn hair, the cheekbones, her strength of character, it is enough to make you fall in love again!",1363046400,,1845,4.442477876106195

459001,5,6302320488,"I can't begin to say how wonderful the Blu-Ray version of this wonderful movie is.  I have always loved this movie.  It was a tradition with my mother and I to watch this every year on St. Patrick's day.  My mom has sadly passed away a long time ago, but I still watch it every St. Patrick's day in her honor.  I went to Ireland last summer, and visited a little village called Cong where this movie was filmed.  When I came back I watched The Quiet man again to see all of the wonderful places I visited in that little village, and how so many things still look the same.  What I also realized however is that the quality of the movie was very grainy, and it was hard to get a true feeling of the beauty I saw in Ireland.  When this version came out, I purchased it right away, hoping it would do to this movie what Blu-Ray remastering did to one of my other all time favorites, The Sound Of Music.  Well, lets say I was blown away.  It is so worth the upgrade to be played on an HD TV and a Blu-ray player.  When watching it, it truly made me feel that I was back in that lovely village of Cong again.  The images and scenery were like when I was there last summer.  The green really pops, but it really does when you are there as well.  I know after visiting Ireland that that is why they are know as the Emerald Isle.  Well, I just wanted to say how happy I was with this version, and what a great job they did remastering a wonderful classic.  The only thing I would add is that I wish they would have included the commentary from Maureen O'Hara in the edition I have.  I really enjoyed listening to her comments on the making of the movie, and all of the special things she had to say about her co-stars and director.  That is why I am keeping that version as well.

There are a few places where there are some imperfections obviously in the original source, but overall, this transfer is top notch.  I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last four decades, and watching this blu-ray was like watching it for the first time.  The old VHS and DVD versions were so dark in places, it was hard to make out exactly what was going on, and even scenes that were supposed to be bright and sunny looked like they were filmed on an overcast day.  Not so here.  For example, there is a scene near the end of the movie where Sean and Will are coming home for supper.  There is a shot where the camera pans up to the cottage.  In the old versions, it was so dark, that all you could see was the exterior of the cottage.  In this blu-ray, you can actually see Mary Kate standing in the doorway.  The sound quality is good as well, but only available in mono due to the source material.  I highly recommend this version to any fan of The Quiet Man, even if you own previous versions.

459041,5,6302320488,"There is probably little more that can be said about this gentle, charming film about an Irish-American's return to his roots in middle-age. The late John Wayne and the marvelously authentic Maureen O'Hara (she was born in Ireland) are practically the definition of on-screen chemistry; the story they and the excellent supporting cast present is both enduring and refreshing.

The major problem with prior DVD editions of this film was the poor print quality. Even the so-called remastered release had a blurry, grainy quality to it that looked more like an old VCR tape than a DVD. Happily, this Blu-ray version solves that problem, at least to the extent that it is possible to do so in connection with a 60-year-old film. For the most part, the colors are vibrant, the scenes are in reasonably sharp focus, and the remastered soundtrack with its almost primal sounding Gaelic music is excellent.

459246,4,6302320488,"In writing this review, I'll assume that one is already a fan of this little charmer of a film and address my comments to the re-mastered DVD. This 60th anniversary special edition DVD is really quite beautiful (even if it isn't a Blu-Ray). The clarity of the image surpasses any previous version. The colors are vivid and rich; the intensity of the reds and greens are just what one would expect (and hope for) from 1950s Technicolor. I realized for the first time exactly why Hotaling, McCarthy, and Thompson were nominated for an Oscar for Best Color Art Direction/Set Direction. The fine details of the sets, especially the interiors, add a new dimension to ""reading"" scenes as one can actually see the furnishings, knick-knacks, and props as well as the photos on the mantelpieces, the paintings on the walls, even the details on the china. The costumes show a depth of textures, patterns, and colors that add quite a bit to the period feel and authenticity of the film. It's possible now to see just how superb the lighting and cinematography truly is. (I just popped in the Collector's Edition for comparison and saw it revealed for the almost unwatchable mess of blurry visuals and mushy sound that it is.) The high quality of the 60th anniversary version does create a few odd disappointments. The process shots using footage filmed in the studio are now seen as poorly done in comparison to the on-location work. And, one can now see a few shots that should never have made the final cut (John Wayne's duck waddle out of the church is a notable example).

So why only a 4 of 5 stars? Why invest so much money creating such a beautiful transfer and not bother with such basics as subtitles or closed captions? The special features are definitely lacking as well. ""The Making of the Quiet Man"" feature is recycled from the Collector's Edition. The printed booklet is interesting, although if one already owns McBride's ""Searching for John Ford,"" there's nothing new there either. No commentary tracks are included, which isn't exactly a deal breaker, but one generally expects so much more from a major anniversary edition.

This is definitely a DVD worth owning. I'm glad I bought it: Watching the film is such a delight with this beautiful HD transfer. But Olive Films should be embarrassed to release a film without even subtitles/closed captioning.

459288,4,6302320488,"It's too bad Amazon has lumped all of the Quiet Man reviews onto each version
of this movie.  They are not all the same that's for certain.

The Blu-Ray edition that I am rating is the very best that I have seen so far and I've
had both DVD versions before the 60th anniversary and now the blu-ray.

I only gave the blu-ray four stars as this is not the best restoration that I have
seen released on blu-ray disc.  There are several frames where damage or
color fringing has not been removed or restored.  You'll notice the color fringing
on very high contrast frames especially in the beginning of the movie where ""Sean Thornton""
and ""Mary Kate"" first see each other as she is herding sheep.
It's red fringing or Chromatic aberration.  There is a bit of green fringing from
time to time, but it's hardly noticeable.

There is also a large bright spot to the very right edge middle of the frame when
Mr Flinn and Sean Thornton are walking across the glen to Thornton's newly
purchased cottage.  It stays in the image for a long time and I can't believe they
missed correcting it.  It occurs again during a later frame I believe with ""Mary Kate"",
but I can't remember the specific frame.

Reds are severely over saturated in this movie and I made corrections accordingly
on my TV.  I know it's not my television as I have calibrated it and other blu-ray
movies have near perfect image quality on it.

If you are a stickler for image quality as I am and you have a nice quality TV
then I encourage you to make adjustments for this movie and write them down.
I have a Samsung 42"" and here are the adjustments that I made:

Try going into your TVs menu and find the equivalent of Picture Mode.
I chose Dynamic and then these settings:
Backlight:  10 ( and that is low on the scale)
Contrast:  70
Brightness:  35
Sharpness:  45
Color:  45
Tint:  G53/R47

Picture Options:
Color Tone :  Cool
Digital Noise Filter :  High
MPEG  Noise Filter :  High

These may or may not help depending on your
TV, but at least you might get an idea of what tweaking
you can do.  I wrote mine down and put a copy in the
movie case, so I can quickly tweak the settings and enjoy
the movie that much faster.

I chose Dynamic as this movie was filmed in Technacolor and the
colors really popped in the original.  I tried other viewing versions
in my TV menu, but they just didn't have the color match for the
film.  Some people will say that is the reason for the fringing, etc,
but I tried in the less dynamic modes and you not only get the same
issues, but less color quality.  You be the judge of your own viewing
experience.

The Blu-ray version really is a Much better version that anything out there,
but I had high hopes for this edition and I got the feeling
as many have in the past that the Wayne family doesn't want to
put much effort/money into the Wayne movies being restored.

That ""just get by"" attitude really shows in the quality of the
restorations.  I do photography work.  I have only read up on
how much time and effort it takes to restore video, but really
if you are going to do it why not just do it right.

This is an incredible movie and for some of us it is also of historical
value.  This Ireland is gone for ever, except where it's captured in video.
I hope this review helps others to make an informed decision before buying.
You won't regret this Blu-Ray version.  I know they released a regular DVD
60th version, but I have not seen it.

Good luck and I hope you enjoy the Quiet Man on Blu-Ray as most of us have
never before seen it.

My movie was purchased from Amazon, but I received it as a gift.",1359244800,9,3605,4.2766272189349115
459289,5,6302320488,"If you love The Quiet Man, the 60th anniversary Blu ray version offers the highest quality viewing experience for home watching yet. This film pops up on TV every St. Patrick's Day, but with worn out versions with dust and scratches, mediocre picture quality, and muffled sound.  Now, Olive Films has done a great job of a 4K scan of the original negative of the film. Pluses: the images are so sharp you can almost reach out and touch the Irish tweed coats and hats, there is no dust and scratches anywhere, and there is a very clear DTS-Master mono audio track that is surprisingly good for a 50's Movie Minuses: This is 1951 Technicolor technology. The color is muted and slightly warm, with lowered contrast. Olive could have touched this up in their scanning, but probably and rightly so, wanted the film to be seen as originally presented. Also, the only extra is ""The Making of The Quiet Man with Leonard Maltin"" has surprisingly bad picture quality compared with the film itself, but this could be the source material. Only interesting to watch for the background on the movie. That's the only extra.

As for the film itself, if you're reading this review, you know its a John Ford classic! This is not the new Hollywood fodder with CGI and foul language covering up hackneyed plots and cookie cutter characters. This is a Full House: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald, plus a cast of colorful supporting actors.

(As some have noted already, there are no closed captions.)  The extra about the making of the movie has great information, but is of very poor visual quality.  It's less than 30 min. long and should have been improved to match the movie.  However, the interviews and stories are just great.

459296,5,6302320488,"This review is for the Blu Ray version of this film. I watched it on a 92"" screen to make sure it could hold up to being projected up to a ridiculously huge level.

Now, 24-hours after watching this stunning Blu Ray, I am still struggling to find words to describe the masterful job Olive did with this transfer. I know this movie very well...probably at the 'geek' level...so I was prepared to scrutinize almost every frame.

Oh my.

All the other 5-star reviews of this version are spot on with examples about the clarity of this movie (the 1-star review entitled, 'Disappointed', I can't explain, so won't bother trying). I saw what the other 5'ers saw, but whether it was watching it at 92"", the clarity of Blu Ray, or both, what I got the biggest thrill from was the very nuanced, almost undetectable smile (almost Mona Lisa-like) Maureen O'Hara gave John Wayne when she first saw him across the meadow. I needed a cold shower right there and then. I'd have paid $100 for this disc just for that. Wow.

Here's another example of it's clarity: in the Blu Ray version of 'It's a Wonderful Life', at 92"" you can clearly read the print on the distant bank deposit slips displayed behind Thomas Mitchell just before he loses the $8,000 to Lionel Barrymore. The Blu Ray of 'The Quiet Man' matches that clarity.",1358985600,68,1309,4.5574468085106385

There's been more than enough praise given to this movie, I just wanted to comment on the newly released blu-ray edition. After watching the blu-ray version and then comparing it to the Artisian dvd release, it makes you realize how bad the Artisian release really was visually. This movie now ""jumps"" off the screen with it's brilliant colors and detail. You can now clearly see such details as telephone wires, the nice tweed material of the Duke's jacket, rain drops on the faces of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, print in the newspaper, and the lines on the character's faces. A job well done by Olive. Unfortunately there aren't any new extras and even one seemed to get dropped all together (Maureen O'Hara interview). My only gripe is that I wish they could've come up with some new extra bonus material. A definte worth while upgrade of the movie. Highly recommended!!!!!",1358985600,10,961,4.726190476190476
459350,5,6302320488,"This review is for Olive's Bluray remastering of The Quiet Man. I am an ageing John Wayne fan, and this film is one of my very favorites, inspite of the fact that the DVD and VHS versions until now have been (visually) painful to watch. I knew this film won an Oscar for its cinematography but, until now, it's been hard to see why. Now I see. Olive has done a great job; all fans of great movies (Duke fans or not) owe them big time.
  The picture is so vastly improved over its poorly predecessors, it's almost shocking. As sharp as you could hope for in a movie this old. I was able to easily make out details utterly invisible before; telephone wires in the background of exterior shots, and drops of rain on Maureen O Hara's face in a scene that was obviously shot hurriedly in one of the brief sunny moments between the rain showers that plagued the production.  (OK, some detail isn't necessarily picturesque, but it shows that Olive did their job well.) If you pause the movie and read the close-up of the newspaper clipping during the scene in Rev. Playfair's study, you will see an example of how this clarity does not always serve the story well. The colors are wonderful, with only the reds of  flowers and skirts being a little overdone. The sound is clear as a bell, and I'm glad they didn't try to concoct a surround track.
  I would say that we could throw out our nasty old Artisan versions, but Olive did not integrate Maureen O Hara's commentary on to this Bluray, so for that reason (alone) I would recommend you keep the Artisan if you have one.
  A wonderful story wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed, and now gorgeously remastered. Thanks, Olive. I'm going to watch it again right now.",1358899200,10,1710,4.493548387096774

459354,5,6302320488,"I placed my order for this 60th-Anniversary BluRay on Nov. 5, 2012, to be sure to have it delivered on its release date. I'm happy to report that amazon delivered the film on that release date (1/22/13).

""The Quiet Man"" is one of those classic films that can be loved and enjoyed on many levels. The story, the acting, the humor, the cinematography, the musical score - it's all been there through the years.

What hasn't been there to enjoy has been a truly exceptional print of the movie. I've seen this movie many times on TV. I've owned it on both VHS and DVD. All of those sources fell short in the visual presentation of the movie. Overly dark, indistinct, lacking in depth and detail. One had to be content with the story and acting to carry the day (though never having seen the film in a theater or in its premiere release condition, I can't be sure what this film looked like when it first played on the big screen).

That situation has been addressed in spades in this new transfer to BluRay. The picture is steady as a rock. Details are amazingly clear. Colors are natural, with great contrasts and consistency (though some reviewers more knowledgeable than I have remarked on there being registration issues). I am particularly happy that Olive has avoided the opportunity to brighten up this film artificially to make things ""pop"" with a 21st-century sensibility. The film retains the darkish quality it has always had (which I assume is close to Ford's vision, or perhaps reflects the fact that the shoot was plagued by rain much of the time), but the transfer technique employed - one can't really call this a full out ""restoration"" of the film - has done its magic within the confines of the original film's palette. The play of light on faces is exceptionally well done, especially when those faces tended toward being blurred in earlier formats. It's simply a joy to watch scenes one knows intimately come to life with a nuance that hasn't been seen in decades, and that could have been missed in less-capable hands.

Having said that, I can't help imagining that a full-out restoration of the film would yield an even better final product. I've never seen this movie in a theater, and I have no idea what constitutes the optimum visual presentation of this particular film, but I don't think that the Olive version will be the final stop in this film's journey back to optimum condition (are you listening, Criterion?)

Victor Young's musical score and the dialogue come through nicely. Background noise has been reduced (not eliminated) from previous issues, but not so much as to sound artificial or clipped. I usually pay particular attention to soundtrack restoration on older films, and while that of ""The Quiet Man"" isn't the revelation of, say, the soundtrack for the BD of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" I will say that within a few minutes of watching QM, I had ceased my critical listening, and found myself sitting back and enjoying the film in all its aspects.

One caveat - there are no subtitles on this disc, a minus when considering that there is an audience of the hard of hearing who should get some consideration when films are released on BD. For that matter, subtitles might also help decipher some of the dialogue that's delivered in those wonderful - and heavy - Gaelic accents!

I can't recommend this BD highly enough. If you know and love this film, you'll be in heaven viewing this transfer.

If you don't know this film, I can think of no better way to make its acquaintance.

I have been waiting for the blu-ray forever, but because they were too cheap to add subtitles I will not buy it no matter how good the picture quality is. Companies like Olive Films who discriminate against the hard of hearing & the deaf should be put out of business. This might sound harsh, but more & more it is becoming hard to find good movies & TV series that have caption or subtitles added. It's very frustrating to us.",1358899200,5,462,4.32183908045977

I found a two hub green case (from Whip It) and moved this blu-ray and the old Artisan DVD into it.  The old DVD allows me to retain the Maureen O'Hara commentary and ""The Joy Of Ireland"" documentary.  There are no sub-titles on the new blu-ray (I have never seen this movie with sub-titles) and I do not miss them.

The Quiet Man is one of these essentials. Just like in ""The Searchers"" the cinematography is absolutely stunning and the colors are vivid, and this was on the dvd. However, the picture quality and clarity was certainly not conducive to the movie and was a disappointment to say the least on the dvd.

Having learned so  much about the (tragic) history of Ireland, especially in the 19th & early 20th centuries, we were able to appreciate much more the often subtle political references.

There is not. All official editions are of low, VHS-or-worse quality.

Without question, this is the poorest video resolution of any officially released digital film transfer in my collection.

Now, I treasure my laserdisc of The Uninvited (1944) as that's the best transfer available - DVDs that are offered online are unofficial dubs which have received mixed reviews regarding quality. Those who are pleased with the dub just seem happy to have it at all because you can make out fairly well what is going on and it is a beloved movie to many. Sort of like watching the Time Machine on Chicago's WGN program Family Classics during the 1960s. Hacked to pieces, riddled with commercials and the top third of the screen flagging to one side (our TV's fault - not the station!). But family, friends and the pizza were great and we loved that movie.

A very muddy, unofficial DVD burned off a friend's taped TV broadcast of the 50s exploitation film 'The Hypnotic Eye' still holds a place of honor in my collection for the same reason. I'm not aware of anything better being available (UPDATE - A Remastered Warner Archives edition is on its way here! I was jazzed at first, but another reviewer states that the film has been oddly formatted to create a widescreen effect, losing a fair amount of what was in the film in the first place. We will report when this arrives and we compare the two editions.)

The Quiet Man won two Academy Awards, nominated for seven, including one for Best Cinematography. The storybook, multiphase greens of Ireland juxtaposed against Maureen O'Hara's glorious complexion and red hair are among the most stunning images in twentieth century film - at least to hundreds of thousands of Hibernophiles. In addition to several other wins and nominations it was among the top ten high grossing films of that year. It remains one of the most beloved films in the U.S.

By comparison, 'Fiend Without a Face' - you know the 1960 movie with the flying brain monsters that suck out your spinal fluid - was rejuvenated when Criterion gave it their wonderful treatment. This low-budget film made money at the box office but nothing like the millions generated by The Quiet Man.

Now, many sources claim a restoration of The Quiet Man has already been done at the film school of UCLA. Whether or not this is true, how, in 2012 can this vastly more popular and successful film be unavailable in high resolution? Not even a word about possible release!

I know there are bigger issues facing the world today. Indeed, from many of them I hoped to escape on this St Patrick's Day by pulling up a barstool with Michaeleen, Sean, Mary Kate, Red Will, Father Lonergan, the Reverend Mister Playfair and the rest of the inhabitants of the mythical Innisfree.

459543,5,6302320488,"An Open Letter to the Executives at Paramount Pictures:

As this is the month of March and St. Patrick's Day is upon us, it would be a great gift to not only Irish Americans and John Wayne fans, but to film lovers the world over to know that Paramount is dedicated to working to release a proper high-definition Blu-ray transfer of this magnificent and beautiful film. Fans of the movie, such as myself, have been limited to watching sub-standard and hastily-transferred DVD and VHS editions of this movie since its initial home release about 30 years ago. Washed out colors, dirt spots, and a host of other issues plauge just about every release of the film, regardless of medium. Other John Wayne pictures of the period have received beautiful restorations and been released on Blu-ray to be enjoyed in their original glory, yet ""The Quiet Man"" remains just that. Of all the older films that would benefit from a restoration, ""The Quiet Man"" would arguably have the most to gain. The lush, green, rolling hills of the Irish countryside deserve to been seen as Ford saw and captured them. Please give the film the respect and treatment it deserves, and help to release it in HD. On behalf of all lovers of this wonderful film, please seriously consider this request for an HD transfer, restoration, and release of ""The Quiet Man.""",1299542400,5,1331,4.761904761904762

459547,4,6302320488,"I've been waiting a long time for ""The Quiet Man"" to finally be released in an acceptable video picture having been so disappointed with the previous VHS and DVD versions. Those Republic titles from 1992 and 2002 contain terrible transfers of this classic John Ford film. I had high hopes when I read that Olive Films would be doing a new 4K scan of the film from the original film negative for it's 60th Anniversary Edition and after having watched it last night I was not disappointed. It's not a perfect blu ray release but it's centainly a lot better than the awful 2002 DVD ""Collector's Edition"" that I had. I say that because there are certain scenes in the film where the colors still appear murky and there is still a lot of visible film grain. But I think this has to do more with the state of the film elements(Technicolor) itself than the restorers at Olive. This is the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five. It's certainly not on par with last year's ""To Catch A Thief""(Paramount) or ""Ben-Hur""(Warners) from the year before, but Olive deserves a lot of credit for giving we fans the best presentation of this delightful film in a long time. It was a personal project for John Ford and his ""stock company"" of actors and film colleagues and after he finished it he was seriously considering retiring from films. Thank god he didn't because we never would have gotten ""The Searchers"" had he did. Olive's new Blu Ray of ""The Quiet Man"" brings out all the themes of previous Ford films none more important than family. Anyone viewing his films ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""How Green is My Valley"" and ""The Searchers"" will certainly see how the family and how they deal with events that are sometimes out of their control really do hit a cord with people. There's a lot of that in ""The Quiet Man"" too. A lot of it has to do with the actors that were cast in individual roles and Ford was the master. You really believe that the Joads are a family in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" even though the actors came from different backgrounds and different parts of the country. The same can be said of ""The Quiet Man"". You really believe that both John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are in love with one another and not going through the motions. The supporting cast is perfect too. Barry Fitzgerald, Victor Mclaglen, and Ward Bond gives great performances and are a delight. There's not much more to say. This blu ray release of Olive's ""The Quiet Man"" is a must for anyone who loves great filmmaking by one of the masters-John Ford. ""The Quiet Man""(Aspect ratio: 1.37.1)is 129 minutes and contains a printed booklet on the film and a ""Making of"" featurette(28 mins.) from the 1992 VHS edition hosted by Leonard Maltin. There are no subtitles. (Note: I also wrote a review of the 2002 DVD ""Collector's Edition"" in June, 2010 which I have since deleted. However, the date on this current review stills lists the old date of June 7, 2010. For the record, this blu ray review was written Jan. 30, 2013. Don't ask me why this happened)",1275868800,,3029,4.539305301645339
459548,5,6302320488,"""The Quiet Man"" (1952) was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor, and won 2 (Best Director and Best Cinematographer). John Ford also won the DGA award that year as well as the International Award at the Venice Film festival and was nominated for a Golden Globe. Screenwriter Frank Nugent won a WGA award.

John Wayne stars as a former boxer who moves from the US to his ancestral home in Ireland.  Wayne was a major box office draw at the time, having appeared in such hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""They Were Expendable"" (1944), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""Rio Grande"" (1950), and ""Flying Leathernecks"" (1951). He was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949). ""The Quiet Man"" was Wayne's 131st film.

Ford and Wayne worked together on 21 films, one of the most prodigious collaborations in film history. ""The Quiet Man"" is amongst their best works, along with ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Searchers"" (1956). This was Ford's 118th film (including 61 silent films). He had already won 3 Oscars - ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941), ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), and ""The Informer""(1935) - and made such memorable films as ""Stagecoach"" in 1939 (Oscar nominated but not a winner) and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" in 1949.

The great Victor McLaglen co-stars as a pugnacious hard drinking Irishman known as ""The Squire"". McLaglen won an Oscar for his performance in ""The Informer"" (1935), directed by John Ford. Ford and McLaglen worked together on 12 films, including Ford's cavalry trilogy (""Fort Apache"", ""Yellow Ribbon"", and ""Rio Grande"") in which Ford, Wayne, and McLaglen collaborated.  Wayne and McLaglen worked together 4 times, each time under Ford's direction. ""The Quiet Man"" would be their last film together, and for McLaglen, it would be his last good film, although he would go on to make 11 films up until his death in 1959. Personally I believe McLaglen's performance in this film is his best ever, far superior to his Oscar winning effort in ""The Informer.""

Maureen O'Hara is the leading lady, playing McLaglen's sister and the apple of Wayne's eye. Ford and O'Hara worked together on only 5 films, but she was his favorite leading lady, not the least reason being that she was Irish through and through. Early on she lit up the screen at 19 as Esmeralda in ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939) and followed that with her first John Ford film in ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941) for which Ford won his second Oscar. She could play comedy (""Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), or action (""Bagdad"" in 1949). ""The Quiet Man"" was her second film with John Wayne (they worked together on ""Rio Grande"" in 1950) and they would make 3 more together - ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), and ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957). This is one of O'Hara's best performances. BTW - she had a beautiful voice and she sang in several of her films, including this one.

The chemistry between O'Hara, McLaglen and Wayne is magical, enhanced by their long history together.

""The Quiet Man"" includes a few of Ford's stock company regulars, notably Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Barry Fitzgerald, Ken Curtis, Hank Worden, and Francis Ford.

- Ward Bond was a football player at USC with his life time friend, John Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film ""Wagon Master"" in which he appeared. Bond was in more  Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture. His part in ""The Quiet Man"" is small and undistinguished.

- Mildred Natwick made her film debut in Ford's ""The Long Voyage Home"" (1940) and followed this with appearances in ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1948). ""The Quiet Man"" was her last Ford film, but she would continue and earn an Oscar nomination for ""Barefoot in the Park"" (1967) and she won an Emmy for ""The Snoop Sisters"" (1973). Her performance in ""The Quiet Man"" is a real hoot, and one of her very best.

- Francis Ford was John's older brother. He was a writer and a director and also an actor, appearing in several films directed by his younger brother - ""The Informer"" (1935), and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939).  ""The Quiet Man"" was his last film with his brother.

- Ken Curtis (he played Charley McCorry in ""The Searchers"") has a small role as an accordion player. Curtis was married to John Ford's daughter and Ford kept him busy in many films including ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""Mr. Roberts"" (1955), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). Curtis is probably best remembered for his role as Festus in the TV series ""Gunsmoke"" (1964 - 1975). In addition to his considerable skills as an actor, Curtis was also a well known singer and he is often heard singing in his films.

- The great Irish character actor Barry Fitzgerald is a riot in this film as the comic (and usually drunk) foil. Ford used him in ""The Plough and the Stars"" (1936), ""The Long Voyage Home"" (1941), ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941), and ""The Quiet Man"" which was their last film together. For his performance in ""Going My Way"" (1944) with Bing Crosby, Fitzgerald won a Golden Globe and a NY Film Critics Award and an Oscar. He made history by being nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for the same role in the same film.

- Hank Worden (played ol' Mose in ""The Searchers"") appears briefly in a flashback. Worden made over 100 films, many with Ford starting with ""Stagecoach"" in 1939. His role here is brief, but fans will enjoy how different he appears in this film.

Many of Ford's other regulars are missing - like Willis Bouchey (the newspaper man in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""), Anna Lee (played the insane Mrs. Malaprop in ""Two Rode Together""),  Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Olive Carry (Harry's mom, who played Mrs. Jorgensen in ""The Searchers""), John Qualen (played Lars Jorgensen  in ""The Searchers""), and Andy Devine (driver in ""Stagecoach"" ).

Charles Fitzsimmons appears briefly. He was Maureen O'Hara's brother, her agent, and, on occasions her producer (""The Deadly Companions"" directed by Sam Peckinpah). ""The Quiet Man"" was his acting debut but his career was short-lived, ending in 1958, with few appearances credited.

The film is a family affair. The Fords were represented by John, Francis, and their brother-in-law, Ken Curtis. Maureen O'Hara had two brothers, James and Charles, on the payroll. Barry Fitzgerald and his younger brother Arthur Shields are on board. And John Wayne managed to get all four of his children in as well.

This film has many key Ford elements. We see the dynamic rivalry between the male leads (e.g., John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter in ""The Searchers"", John Wayne and Henry Fonda in ""Fort Apache"", John Wayne and William Holden in ""The Horse Soldiers""), the importance of family (""How Green was My Valley"", ""The Searchers""), his use of the comic foil (e.g., Victor McLaglen in ""Yellow Ribbon"", Ken Curtis in ""The Searchers""), the sacrifice of long held principles to attain a higher end (e.g., Ethan gives up his secret plan to kill Natalie Wood in ""The Searchers"",  Captain Brittles decides to forego ""one last mission"" and accept his age in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""),  and Ford's wonderful camera work, not only in the medium shot but in the action sequences. The climatic fist fight between Wayne and McLaglen is terrific.

As already noted, the film was an enormous critical success. It was widely known as the best film Republic Pictures ever produced. Commercially, at $3.8 million, it was one of the top 10 grossing pictures of 1952. Ironically enough, it out-grossed ""Rio Grande"" which came in at $2.2 million, and Republic studio execs had insisted that Ford (plus Wayne, O'Hara, and McLaglen) make ""Rio Grande"" to pay for the losses they anticipated ""The Quiet Man"" would produce.

""The Quiet Man"" is a must see film. Fans of Wayne, O'Hara, and McLaglen, as well as Barry Fitzgerald and Mildred Natwick, will be treated to some of their very best performances, and fans of John Ford will see what the master could do.",1270252800,2,8681,4.836817262306136

A real test of a work of art is whether the viewer keeps finding something new in it time after time.  ""The Quiet Man "" meets this test.  This time I was impressed by the cultural tension between the Americanism of Sean Thornton (John Wayne) and the Irishness of the other characters, something which I had not picked up on so keenly in past viewings.

459621,5,6302320488,"Every St. Patrick's day this movie should be pulled out and played.  John Ford directed John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in this romantic comedy.  Ford takes a sentimental trip down memory lane to his homeland and it never looked so green.  Barry Fitzgerald plays the impish..you'd swear he's a leprechaun..matchmaker to comic perfection.  Wayne plays Sean Thornton returning home to buy the old homestead and put down roots.  He meets the curious townspeople and awakens this sleepy hamlet by not always sticking to the 'proprieties'. Besides being American and new to town, this 'Wild Colonial Boy' has plans.  Buying 'White O'Mornin'..his old homestead..from the widow Tillane gets him in the book with Will Danaher (Victor Mclaglen) and soon the love of Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).  This eventually builds to the knock-down brawl that resolves all the issues.

Ford used his stock players to round out this film...Ward Bond, Ken Curtis, etc.  This movie has many facets, and fortunately for us, Ford keeps it lively...he didn't delve too deeply into these.  There is the IRA, Catholics vs Protestants, and the mixture of a Gaelic patriarchal society.  These Sean has to face and adjust to in order to win his wife as well as his place in this society.

There is a reason that this movie is on many lists of great films.  This is a well acted and directed movie.  One that deserve a place in any and all collections.",1142553600,3,1416,4.870292887029288
459622,3,6302320488,"This is not your typical John Wayne Film, which is what makes it worthwhile and amusing. Like many this is a movie I have seen since I was a kid.  I use to think it was great then, and I still think its amusing today, and beautifully photographed.

Having since grown up and traveled to Ireland (once, don't know if I will again in this lifetime!) I would have to say this is not a flattering portrait of the auld sod!  Women are portrayed as tempermental, explosive creatures, and men are expected to thrash them around to calm things down in the household.  Not a great image for Ireland today or anytime!  A lot of the characters are standard Irish stock portraits.  In other words hopeless stererotypes that are no longer the norm today.

The final fight scene is a typical Hollywood joke.  John Ford for all his supposed accuracy in cinema allows two giants to pommel each other for hours w/o a drop of blood shown on screen!  Now of course if the real thing were shown I suppose it would take the fun of it away.  I guess you notice these things after you have grown up and seen a film again after a few years.  This is a fun flick for Saint Patrick's Day where nobody takes anything serious about Ireland!  Unfortunately many Americans of Irish background have these out-dated notions about what Ireland is about today.  These romantic and silly ideas were gleaned from looking at films like this when they were kids!

459624,1,6302320488,"There is a tendency when you really like a movie to gloss over any problems with its transfer to DVD. After all, this is a very good movie by the best director that ever lived - John Ford.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION. If it were a car it would be recalled.  Do not let your affection for the material convince you it is acceptable.
On my TV, using component video imputes, it has the worst color of any DVD I've seen - with the possible exception of $4.99 bargins. The color saturation varies, going up and down at intervals. The detail is lousy. This looks like a third generation video copy. While the problem gets a little better towards the end, it is still very bad. This kind of treatment for a film that won an Oscar for cinematography? Ah, the profit motive.
If you would like to see a great John Ford film on DVD where some care has been spent on restoration, try ""My Darling Clementine,"" ""The Searchers"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath.""
Leonard Maltin hosts a ""making of"" short on the DVD. Is his presence a tacit endorsement of the transfer? And if so, does he not carry some responsibility?",1083542400,17,1095,4.367647058823529
459625,4,6302320488,"Sean Thornton has returned to the ancestral seat of the Thorntons of old after living in Pittsburgh as a boxer.  His being named after his grandfather, a well-respected man in the parts despite his later going to Australia as a convict, aids him in being well-liked in Inisfree.  He is made most welcome by elderly and impish Michaleen Flynn, the local matchmaker and pub regular.  Actually, they all are, but Flynn seems out of place without a whisky or beer in his hand.
Soon, Thornton meets the fiery-spirited and -haired Mary Kate Danaher, a spinster living with her bullheaded bully of a brother Will.  He initially refuses permission for Thornton to court Mary Kate, mostly out of spite.  Seems that he wanted the old Thornton cottage for himself, but his abrasiveness peeves the owner, the Widow Tillane so much that she sells it to Thornton.
However, conspiracies lead to the courtship and eventually the wedding.  The pivotal point comes when Will becomes aware of the conspiracy during the wedding banquet and refuses the dowry of 350 pounds.  Thornton thinks that it's just money, but he doesn't understand that the dowry also represents Mary Kate's honour and dignity.
Nowadays, a dowry is virtually nonexistent, but back then, it was a big deal.  It's datedness and lack of female emancipation may not go well with women today.  What is the thrust of this movie is Thornton realizing the difference between American and Irish culture, such as the courting and matchmaking functions, taken so seriously in Inisfree.  And in a place like Inisfree, secrets are hard to keep in this small village, plus it's that group mentality that can be helpful or not to a person.  For instance, Flynn, Father Lonigan, and the other vicar conspire against the bullying Danaher because he is not well-liked and has a point of putting people who speak out against him in his book to get back at them later, yet they become disappointed with Thornton because of his refusal to fight.
This was done during the last decade of Victor McLaglen's life--he would be dead in six years, but he does well as Will with that rough voice and craggy face.  He starred in John Ford's three cavalry movies with John Ford opposite Wayne, of which the last had Maureen O'Hara.  And O'Hara (Mary Kate) would star opposite Wayne in Wings of Eagles and McLintock, where she would be just as mistreated by Wayne in the finale.  But Barry Fitzgerald steals the movie as the rascally tippler Flynn.
Given my politics, this is one of the few John Wayne movies I'll consider watching over and over.  It isn't just John Ford's direction (Best Director) or the refreshing Irish scenery, which won Best Cinematography but Wayne's mostly understated performance compared to that swaggering ""Well, pilgrim"" attitude.  There's something comforting about him wearing tweeds and cap compared to a ten-gallon hat, boots, and a Winchester, or a World War II military uniform.",1063324800,2,2934,4.9089068825910935
459626,5,6302320488,"John Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" is one of John Wayne's best roles and best performances.  The Irish culture, countryside, and music truly made this film a masterpiece of the 20th century.  Maureen O'Hara played the hotheaded Irish native ""Mary Kate"" - a role for which she is well suited when one considers her other performances in such great films as ""McClintock!""
Each and every main character is central to this film, and if a single were to be missing, the whole movie would have lost its quality, in my opinion.  The tough-minded, levelheaded thinking of Sean Thornton (John Wayne) combined with the rather emotional display of ""foolish"" honor on the part of his bride, Mary Kate, contrast nicely and do a wonderful job of illustrating some pretty clear differences in the across-the-pond cultures.
This is a delightful film and I highly recommend it.",1062633600,3,853,4.951048951048951
459627,5,6302320488,"If you're like me, once you view ""The Quiet Man"""", you will want to take it out each year on St. Patrick's Day and laugh, cry, and revel in it's genius!  This may be the best movie that John Ford ever directed, as this is truly a masterpiece from start to finish. Filmed on location in Ireland, Ford used the beautiful green countryside to frame his story of a former boxer, Shawn Thornton (John Wayne) who leaves America for Ireland after he accidently kills another fighter in the ring.  Hating himself for pummeling his foe to death for the money purse, Shawn vows to never use his fists again.  In Ireland, Shawn buys his boyhood home in Innisfree, and simutanelusly incurs the rath of his neighbor, Will Danaher, who wanted the property himself.  Shawn quickly falls head over heels for the bewitching beauty of Mary Kate Danaher, Will Danaher's sister (Maureen O'Hara - in perhaps her best role).  Unfortunately for Thornton, Will Danaher refuses to give his sister in marriage to the man he despises.  Enter official matchmaker Michaleen Oge Flynn, who with the help of the local clergy, hatches a secret plot to get Will Danaher to give up his sister to Thornton.  Shawn and Mary Kate are finally married; however, there is one more problem, Mary Kate's brother Will refuses to deliver her 350 dollar dowry after he discovers he's been tricked.  Shawn, who hates money due to his boxing history, refuses to press the issue with Danaher, causing Mary Kate to think Shawn is a coward and does not care for her.  Mary Kate decides to leave her husband to shame him, and heads for the train station.  This is the last straw for Shawn and the end of his ""quiet-man"" ways.  The last 30 minutes of the film is an absolutely delightful, hillarious romp through the contryside, first to retrieve his wife, and second, to fight Mary Kate's brother for the dowry.  A marvelous finish it is.  Ford's genius is clearly evident in the humorous manner in which he wraps up this film.  I laughed until I cried!

The movie's score is wonderfullly Irish (of course), and I guarantee you will be humming the various musical themes long after the movie is over.

The character casting is excellent and unforgettable.  Wayne is superb as the American Yank Shawn Thornton, and O'Hara matches him scene for scene as the fiery and fiesty Mary Kate.  Their on-screen chemistry is obvious, and it is apparent both actors truly enjoy each others company and work.  The supporting cast is superb as well, with Ford gathering his ""family"" of actors around him to make ""The Quiet Man"" a movie you will never forget.  Barry Fitzgerald (as Michaleen Flynn), should have won an Oscar for his hilarious portrayal of the boozed-up mathchmaker.  Victor McLaglen as Will Danaher is equally gifted.

Beautifully filmed, artistically directed, and wonderfully acted, ""The Quiet Man"" is pure and simple, a true gem of a film, and one you will want to watch again and again. Make sure you purchase the BLU-RAY version - it is crystal clear!

459688,5,6302320488,"A wonderful story about an ex American boxer named Sean (Trooper) Thornton who returns to his homeland in Ireland on the Emerald Isle in the town of Innisfree to live a quiet peaceful life amongst his own people and the land of his childhood. He came home to start a new life after his last fight which resulted in a fatal knockout of his opponent at which time he vowed never to fight again. When Sean arrives, he buys an old thatched cottage which was owned by the wealthy but charitable Widow Tillane. Sean then meets his love, the red-headed strong-willed and materialistic Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), who just happens to be the sister of the toughest bully in the town, Squire Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen)who also wanted the little cottage but was bid out by Sean Thornton which of course would put them at odds against each other right of the bat not just because he outbid him, but because Danaher was courting for the Widow Tillane's affections, but things get a bit ugly when Sean starts showing an interest in his sister Mary Kate. This sets the story on it's way and with the other characters in this movie, it just gets more entertaining and often funny and musical with many Irish ballads being sang by all and let's not forget about the male bonding in the town pub with the dark beer and song. Beautiful cinematography with many shots taken on location in Ireland with wonderful scenery that will take your breath away. You will enjoy the character of Michaeleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald)who seems to take many different roles in the town, but he is very likable and entertaining and his character is one of only a few that actually knew Sean as a child. A very good and lighthearted movie and a movie that I believe John Wayne displayed a more gentle side of himself, but still tough when pushed too far, but still a classic John Wayne effort that leaves your irish eyes smiling. This movie is guaranteed to entertain people of all ages. It was very well done by a company that was supposedly doing low-budget ""B"" movies (Republic Pictures)and was one of John Fords favorite achievements as a producer and director and the only movie at the time that Republic Pictures made that was ever nominated for an oscar. Very well worth buying and a real nice addition to any John Wayne fans out there and it's a must have for any John Wayne film collection.

459689,5,6302320488,"Blarney and bliss, mixed in equal proportions. John Wayne plays an American boxer who returns to the Emerald Isle, his native land. What he finds there is a fiery prospective spouse (Maureen O'Hara) and a country greener than any Ireland seen before or since--it's no surprise The Quiet Man won an Oscar for cinematography. It also won an Oscar for John Ford's direction, his fourth such award. The film was a deeply personal project for Ford (whose birth name was Sean Aloysius O'Fearna), and he lavished all of his affection for the Irish landscape and Irish people on this film. He also stages perhaps the greatest donnybrook in the history of movies, an epic fistfight between Wayne and the truculent Victor McLaglen--that's Ford's brother, Francis, as the elderly man on his deathbed who miraculously revives when he hears word of the dustup. Barry Fitzgerald, the original Irish elf, gets the movie's biggest laugh when he walks into the newlyweds' bedroom the morning after their wedding, and spots a broken bed. The look on his face says everything. The Quiet Man isn't the real Ireland, but as a delicious never-never land of Ford's imagination, it will do very nicely.",1047513600,,1178,4.954545454545454

459692,5,6302320488,"When fans of John Ford debate his greatest film and when fans of John Wayne debate his greatest film, ""The Quiet Man"" is surely mentioned with prominance.  This movie is a terrific look at rural Ireland and its' archaic customs.  John Ford has never disguised his love of his ancestrial home and this movie is as good a testament to that love as any movie he has ever made.  It takes place in a small rural setting where a stranger (John Wayne) shows up one day.  The stanger reveals that he is Sean Thornton who has come home to his birth place.  He immediately falls for Mary Kate Danaher only to find that her brother, Will Danaher, is the town's tough man.  Sean also finds out that the ways of Ireland are not the ways of the USA where he was raised.  Sean has a secret that he keeps that he keeps to himself.  It is a secret that keeps him from fighting the assertive Will Danaher.  Through some conniving help from the local clergy, Sean is able to gain the hand of Mary Kate.  However, her expectations of Sean and his failure to deliver makes this a marriage in name only.  The only way to win her heart and solve his problems with his reputation is to fight his new brother-in-law.  What should he do?
Each step of this story introduces us to characters, customs, music, and other aspects that bring out the Irish flavor.  We may not agree with the customs but we certainly have fun seeing how Sean Thornton is confounded by them.  Fans of Wayne will have a special appreciation of his outstanding preformance.  He is subdued but not beaten, confused but not lost.  He is excellently matched with Maureen O'Hara who brings a brilliant performance as Mary Kate Danaher.  She makes for a strong woman in a movie that demonstrates women's weak status in the culture.  Andrew McLaglen is also excellent as the imposing Will Danaher who takes a step back for no one.  One of the great qualities of a John Ford film is the stock acters that fill the many supporting roles.  In this movie we are treated to a number of great supporting preformances highlighted by the acting of Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields, and Mildred Natwick.
The cinematography is terrific, the scenery inviting, and the music is superb.  Lucky is the person who has the soundtrack of this movie.  The music is enchanting from the beginning to the end.
Over the years I have met my share of John Wayne detractors.  As yet I have not met one who won't secretly acknowledge that they loved this film.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and it is one that can be watched over and over.",1039910400,,2581,4.465811965811966

459697,4,6302320488,"...which has to do with an anti-woman scene at the end of the movie. Otherwise, this John Ford movie is a-one!
John Wayne stars as an American-bred Irish-born man who has decided to return to the land of his birth for a mysterious reason. He certainly has a jammed-pack first day in town: He meets a gnome-like matchmaker who becomes his best friend (Barry Fitzgerald, best professional Irishman in Hollywood); spies a red-headed beauty on the hillside, soon to be his wife (frequent co-star Maureen O'Hara), and makes an enemy (Victor McLaglen), over a parcel of land. The enemy unfortunately happens to be the brother of that red-haired beauty. John and Maureen have a hard time getting married, due to that angry brother of hers, but just when you might think they've solved their problem, said brother refuses to provide Maureen with her dowry. John doesn't realize it at first, but in this sociological group, that means she won't consider herself married, and if she's not married, well, he can just forget about ever sleeping in that big double bed with her. Situation is resolved as you might expect, complete with a donnybrook of a fight between Wayne and McLaglen, just after the mysterious secret is divulged for the audience's benefit.
The film stars the usual stable of performers used by Ford: Wayne, O'Hara, McLaglen, Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, and Arthur Shields (the real-life brother of Barry Fitzgerald, here playing the Protestant minister). Actors comfortable with their director can do a wonderful job, and that's what we have here. The other stand-out in ""The Quiet Man"" is the lush cinematography, which won a well-deserved Oscar. That scene when Wayne sees O'Hara for the first time is a knock-out, with her red hair showing off gloriously in technicolor.
Although I did give this movie 4 stars, I do have my reservations about it:
At the end of the movie, John Wayne pulls Maureen O'Hara out of a train station, and proceeds to drag her over the field (literally) back home to their town, where he confronts Victor McLaglen, saying that since there's been no dowry, there's no marriage, and he can have his sister back.  After the money issue is resolved, Maureen tells Wayne that she'll be going home to get dinner ready, and strides off with a smile on her face. The message: When a woman displays too much independence, it is her husband's right to brutalize her until she capitulates. In fact, this is what she really wants him to do, anyway. It's also worth noting that the violence takes place after they have consummated their marriage.  Before that, the Wayne character was very tender in his treatment of O'Hara. Now that she's his possession, however, he doesn't have to bother with that.
This obviously misogynist development spoils what would have been a perfect film. I remember my dad told me that my grandmother had liked this film in the movie theatre until that dragging scene, which infuriated her, causing her to exclaim that no Irishwoman would ever put up with such treatment. I must confess that I felt anger myself looking at it. But it goes beyond Irishwomen; no woman anywhere should be subjected to abuse and degradation. I wish I had the power to alter the movie's ending, so that scene could have been rewritten.
My final comment? Despite providing us with a disturbing look into Ford's attitudes toward women and how to relate to them as equals, ""The Quiet Man"" is a beautifully filmed movie that shows us a verdant Ireland with an unusually strong cast.",1030838400,5,3522,4.858569051580699

I think that 100 years form now John Ford will be seen as the best American Director of the 20th century.  In his movie, ""The Quiet Man,"" we see John Ford dreaming of an Ireland that, like Shangra-La, exists as an image of a perfect place.  He assembled John Wayne and a magnificent Irish cast to present a wonderful tale of two people trying to get together accross a huge cultural gap.  In ""The Quiet man"" we have the beautiful Maureen O'Hara, the tale's narrator, Ward Bond, and the real-life brothers, Arthur Shields and Barry Fitzgerald.  The protagonist of the story is Victor McLaglin who refuses to give his consent to the marriage of Wayne and O'Hara.  Everyone in this movie is a little jewel who displays their human side and thier finer sides.
All through the movie we know that a climactic fight is coming between John Wayne (who had many homeric movie fights including ""The Spoilers"" and ""McKlintoch"") and Victor McLaglin (who also pummled movie foes in films like ""Gunga Din"" and ""What Price Glory"").  I think that one of the neatest movie moments for me is the second before the fight Maureen O'Hara gives us a look that lets us know that all through the film Wayne has chased her until she caught him.
""The Quiet Man"" is a perfect piece of film making by the great John Ford.  Everyone ought to have a favorite film and I share mine with millions who love it too.  I recommend it to people who like films, are romantic, like John Wayne or any others in the cast.  I recommend it to people who seek a little Shangra-La.",1029024000,,1728,4.457142857142857

459774,5,6302320488,"That will be the result of seeing easily one of the top 5 movies John Wayne ever made.  The only gun is a starting pistol.  The horses are either drawing wagons or in the big race.
The plot is simple John Wayne (Sean Thornton)returns from America where he was raised to settle back in his old home town in Ireland.  He runs afoul of Victor McLaughlin (Red Will Danaher) over a piece of land, but also falls for Danaher's sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).
This simple plot is overshadowed by an event in Wayne's past that shapes and scars him.  It isn't introduced at first but soon takes over the picture propelling it to its climax.
The supporting cast, many of which we have seen many times before together (McLaughlin, Natwick, Shields, Bond et/all) all give top notch performances as usual.  The subplot involving McLaughlin & Natwick shines bright and Barry Fitsgerald adds the right bit of blarney to the package.
What makes this very pleasant move even more appealing is the 2nd level of supporting players and the community (who doesn't know Wayne's secret) that they play.  That community opinion and its consequences steers the picture, but only by fleshing out that community can it work.  We care about what these people think becasue we like these people.  From the Bartender, to the Engineer to Father Paul we meet the people of this village.
I think the appeal of this picture is that community.  The idea of everybody knowing everybody else.  It contributed to its success at the time of its release when it was the reality here to some degree.  It contributes to its success now as we miss that same security.
You also can't go very wrong when you pair O'Hara the ultimate strong woman with Wayne the ultimate strong man.  Only Hepburn & Tracy can equal them here.

459775,5,6302320488,"The lush and beautiful countryside of Ireland provides the setting for this engaging tale of an Irishman, raised in America, going back home to escape a past he'd just as soon forget.  In ""The Quiet Man,"" director John Ford returns to his own roots, going on location to tell the story of Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a man troubled by an incident that changed his life, and now doing what he can to forget about it and just move on.  And toward that end, Sean travels to the place he knows so well from the stories told him by his mother, to Innisfree, intending to buy the cottage in which he was born, White O'Morn, where he can make a fresh start and build a new life for himself.  There's a problem, however; the land and the cottage is owned by the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), and borders the estate of one Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who not only fancies the widow herself, but wants to buy her land.  Squire Danaher (as he's known) is not the only one Sean must deal with, though, as other matters arise upon his arrival in the small hamlet of his birth.  And her name is Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara)-- who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister.  But Danaher or no, it makes no difference to Sean, who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.
 Sean soon learns that in Ireland, however, such things are pursued quite differently than in America.  To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) a kind of matchmaker/chaperone/marriage broker, who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher, without which the marriage cannot and will not take place.  So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs, and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures.  In the meantime, he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn, which he is determined to have at any cost.
 John Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures, going back to the days of silent films, and his favorite star, with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films, was John Wayne.  And when you think of the John Ford/John Wayne collaborations, it's the Western that instantly comes to mind:  ""Stagecoach,"" ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,"" ""Fort Apache,"" ""Rio Grande"" or ""The Searchers,"" (to name a few).  Yet, ""The Quiet Man"" is perhaps their most memorable effort, and remains a favorite among fans to this day.  Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for it) presents the story on a very personal level, and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate; and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity.  That, plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so true-to-life.  Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland, from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life.  It's quite simply a wonderful, uplifting film, impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast.
 Too often, John Wayne's work gets a bad rap; no matter what role he takes on, you're liable to hear ""John Wayne is always John Wayne, the only difference is the character's name.""  And, as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton, it's not only a false statement, it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many, in his craft as well as in his personal life.  The Oscar he finally received for 1969's ""True Grit"" was way overdue, especially when you consider his performances in such films as ""The Searchers,"" ""Red River"" and, of course, this one.  Is he the best actor of all time?  Of course not; but he is good at what he does, much better than he is usually given credit for.  And he (and his films) can always-- always-- be counted on to provide good, solid entertainment.  Together, he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies, and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius.  There's real chemistry between them, which enables them to play so well off of one another.  They made five films together between 1950 (""Rio Grande"") and 1971 (""Big Jake""), and there is always that spark of magic between them, but never better than in this film.
 A gifted actor, Maureen O'Hara is also, without question, one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen.  It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree.  It's entirely believable.  And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty-- who Mary Kate is down deep-- it's even more understandable.  Perfectly cast, O'Hara, like Ford, returned to her roots to make this film (she was born in Milltown, Ireland, near Dublin), and apparently it agreed with her, because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired.  Mary Kate Danaher, in fact, is arguably one of her-- if not ""the""--  most memorable roles of her career.
 The supporting cast, topped by Fitzgerald (who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen) also includes Ward Bond (Father Lonergan), Francis Ford (Dan Tobin), Arthur Shields (Reverend Playfair) and Jack MacGowran (Feeney).  A delightful and endearing motion picture, ""The Quiet Man"" is, of all of John Ford's achievements, one of his best.  And Sean, Mary Kate, Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again.  It's the magic of the movies.",1012176000,8,5665,4.690596562184024

459806,5,6302320488,"""The Quiet Man"" is my favorite movie. I must have watched it 50 times and I never tire of it. True, the portrayal of Ireland and the Irish people is something of a caricature and the movie does exaggerate some of the aspects of life in Ireland. But I really think, having lived in Ireland for a year and having traveled there many times, that John Ford does capture something of the soul of the island and it's people. Counties Galway and Mayo are, if anything, even more beautiful than what Ford captured on film. The people of rural Ireland are every bit as open and friendly as he depicts. However, ""The Quiet Man"" portrays an Ireland that may be fading away as the nation is no longer an impoverished backwater of Europe, from which it's sons must emigrate to seek their fortunes. Today it is the economic ""Celtic tiger"" to which its migrs are returning. Some things do not change though. In the opening scene of ""The Quiet Man"" John Wayne is given ""directions"" to Innisfree that involve everything but how to actually get to Innisfree. In 1993, during my first trip to Ireland, I was given the same kind of ""directions"" while wandering the streets of Dublin!",998697600,,1163,4.569377990430622

459809,5,6302320488,"This movie really offers a little bit of everything, tied together in style into a magnificent cinematic package by one of the greatest directors who ever lived. It gives you one of the greatest screen couples ever, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara; it gives you unquestionably the greatest screen slugfest ever, between Wayne and Victor McLaglen; it gives you unforgettable performances by the premier members of the John Ford Stock Company, including Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond and Mildred Natwick; it gives you exquisite color photography of the Irish countryside, so that everyone who sees this movie will want to arise and go to Innisfree. Another thing it gives you, which most people don't credit it for, is the subtlety of the interrelationships between the characters. John Ford learned something from his countryman Oscar Wilde in presenting a comedy: the characters never learn a great many important secrets about each other, and never fully understand each other, but manage to reconcile anyway in the end. This gives the film a blessed grounding in reality that carries its moments of fantasy and whimsy. The Quiet Man is far more influential than most people assume; if you don't believe me, just rent a double bill of this movie and Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night,"" which was made a few years after The Quiet Man. And also, there is something I must restate: THIS MOVIE HAS MAUREEN O'HARA. Wonderful, marvelous Maureen O'Hara, she of the flowing auburn tresses and fiery demeanor. What more can I say? Buy this video, and Erin go bragh.",984787200,8,1555,4.984615384615385
459810,4,6302320488,"In what was easily John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara's single best performances, the spellbinding story set in the midst of Ireland's breath-taking rural culture is a perpetual favorite film for me. Hardly a year goes by that I don't pull it down from the shelf to enjoy on a stormy day such as this to marvel over Miss O'Hara's astonishing beauty and the endless charm of the characters woven so memorably by Director John Ford. What is most surprising is Ford's sensitive and knowing handling of the cross-cultural misunderstandings that provide the grist of the comedy of well-intentioned errors that propel the star-crossed lovers throughout the breadth of the movie.
We viewers are quickly caught up in all this sentimental nonsense as well, and seem content to wallow in the obvious silliness and contrived situations these misunderstanding throws into in the characters' way. Yet, for all the stereotypical and all-too romanticized treatments of both bucolic ignorance, on the one hand, and world-weary sophistication, on the other, one finally surrenders to a work of art unfolding on the celluloid screen, however unlikely or improbable. Like Ford's westerns, the characters on the screen represent cultural icons, and often act like such. Yet here we see much more openness, tenderness, and honest human emotion than in any of Ford/Wayne's other joint projects.
As it is, when I remember the Duke, it is in the character in this movie that I think of him as having his finest and truest cinematic moments, acting like a twentieth century man forced by personality and circumstances into facing both his inner demons and his hopes for the future as captured in a dazzling and daunting redhead (O'Hara), a cinematic presence who was every inch his match. Nowhere else, not even in ""Stagecoach"" or ""True Grit"", is Wayne quite so good or quite so believable.  Add this to some unforgettable characterization and the breath-taking beauty of a long-ago Irish landscape, and you have a classic film! As such, this is movie magic that I heartily recommend.

In this epic movie about an American boxer who kills a man in the ring and goes to Ireland to find himself, Wayne delivers one of the great performances ever seen, displaying an astonishing range of emotion and acting ability as, despite his vow to renounce violence, he is inevitably forced to fight for his bride, the ravishing Maureen O'Hara, whose brother opposes her marriage and refuses to give her her inheritance.  Magnificent acting by all involved.

This is a film of such warmth, tenderness, humour and beauty that it just sparkles from beginning to end.
Irish-born, American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to his place of birth after accidently killing another man in the ring. Seeking to find peace and happiness in the lush green country side, Sean is enraptured with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara in a wonderful performance) but incurs the wrath of her bully of a brother Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) because of Thornton's purchase of local land.  Failing to abide by the customs of Irish courtship as advised by resident matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) and Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond)...it's not long before the whole county is in a spin about this big Yank in their midst !!
Amidst the lopsided courtship and Red Will's refusal to pay the dowry, Thornton & Danaher square off in what must be the most entertaining and longest on screen fights in cinema history...much to the amusement of the entire town that turned out to watch !!

 ""The Quiet Man"" was  John Ford's favourite film, and also his most personal one. He cast his  favourite actors in it, and it shows.

Legally, the husband had the right to administer the dower  fund but could not use it for himself. He was a trustee of his wife's money  and in effect the money was her reserve in the event the marriage failed.
