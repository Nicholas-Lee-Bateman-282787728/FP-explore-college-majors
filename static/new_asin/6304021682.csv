757519,4,6304021682,"In contrast to most American war stories this fellow is famous for saving lives , not taking them. The military credo for bed patients is they are as good as dead, so his patients were ""written off"" in the evacuation of Java.
Japanese prisoner of war camps were death sentences for  many healthy people during that war. Dr. Wassell got the last ship out and the first one that he missed was sunk.
His charges nick-named him grandpa Fudd after the bugs bunny cartoon character, so you know he wasn't very much like the character Gary Cooper played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-Whom-the-Bell-Tolls/dp/0783229488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>.

who ended up on Java and saved many wounded men who were rejected entrance
into a ship leaving for safety because they could not get up and walk. It is
an amazing story and I am hoping someone will get it transfered to DVD before
it is beyond saving!

757521,5,6304021682,"This movie is one of the best WWII movies ever made.  It's the true story of a dedicated doctor who saved the lives of wounded sailors during the worst time of WWII for the US and its allies.  This is a true story with Gary Cooper at his best.

This is one movie you will always remember and a must for WWII buffs.  Yes, its a long movie but well done and must be watched past the last credits.",1173139200,6,394,3.949367088607595
757522,4,6304021682,"THE STORY OF DR WASSEL WAS IN MY OPINION ON PAR WITH FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, GARY COOPERS ACTING WAS AT HIS BEST I MAY BE.

757523,4,6304021682,"Cecil B. De Mille was inspired to make this 1944 movie after hearing of the heroic efforts of Navy doctor Corydon M. Wassell in one of Franklin Roosevelt's fireside chats.  When the Japanese were sweeping throughout the East Indies, Dr. Wassell (Gary Cooper) refuses to abandon wounded sailors from the cruiser Marblehead who were left behind in Java when the Americans evacuated.  Against great odds, Wassell succeeds in getting all of the men to Australia alive.  Certainly an inspiring story, but obviously in the hands of the wrong director as De Mille throws in melodramatic romance, dancing girls and pretty much every World War II cliche known.  ""The Story of Dr. Wassell"" has an immense cast and a surprisingly slow pace which all serves to detract from Gary Cooper's grim resolve to lead the men to safety.  Wassel's claim this film was ""98 per cent documentary"" is just not credible.  I found myself thinking this film would have worked a lot better in black and white, which would have been more appropriate to the grim but fascinating story at the heart of the movie.  Final note of interested: this film was released on D-Day.",991526400,18,1139,4.84020618556701
757524,3,6304021682,"This is a long (2 hour, 17 minute) film that is leisurely paced as it depicts dedicated Wassell, American M.D. stationed in Java during WW II, who goes against direct orders to stay with and then evacuate wounded men  under his care.  Technicolor is beautiful and Cooper is perfectly cast as  the humanitarian doctor.  Too slow for some, but nevertheless absorbing and  inspiring.  Oscar Nom for Special Effects.  Worth a watch.",933206400,17,428,4.943661971830986

757671,5,6304021682,"This is specifically for the Region 0 PAL Spanish release of this 1944 Cecil B. DeMille film from 1944, not any inferior pirates floating around.
Excellent if slow-moving DeMille epic with Gary Cooper as reliable as ever. This Universal sub-licence to the Spanish distributor has a great transfer, plus original trailer.
Both English and Spanish language soundtracks and optional English/Spanish subs. At 150 minutes, it's a long haul through the studio jungle, but it does have the requisite DeMille
heft to the drama and emotion. One either likes the director's didactic style or not(oddly enough, I like Oliver Stone's work for similar reasons)and the film is full of wartime propaganda.
However that never outweighs the human story. Another good reason to be thoroughly multi-zoned in the home entertainment world.

757674,5,6304021682,"This is one of Gary Cooper's finest movies--up there right along side ""High Noon"" and ""Friendly Persuasion"", yet it is one that few people today have ever heard of.  It is a wonderful story, based on a real person and his real life, in which Gary Cooper plays Dr. Corydon Wassell, an Arkansas country doctor who goes to China to practice medicine and while there is caught up in WWII.  He becomes a Naval Officer devoted to caring for the wounded and his heroism under fire eventually earns him the Navy Cross and a nationally broadcast commendation from President Roosevelt.
