8682700,3,B00O9OEBAI,"""The Magnificent Dope"" is a typical Hollywood picture of its period i.e a pleasant romantic comedy with some fine stars (Henry Fonda and Don Ameche), an attractive leading lady (Lyn Bari), a good supporting cast (Edward Everett Horton, George Barbier etc), an efficient but unimaginative director (Walter Lang), good photography with some nice close-ups (Peverall Marley) and a reasonable script.  None of these components are sufficient to make the film memorable. Let's simply say it's a pleasant way to spend an undemanding 85 minutes.

The story is that one about the country hick in the city, the shyster who tries to exploit him, and the girl who switches allegiance from the latter to the former. It is all fairly predictable and there are a few chuckles along the way.  Fonda does his ""aw shucks"" routine which I personally find grating.  This was quite an important film for Lyn Bari because it was her first A film in which she played a romantic lead. She is competent but not individual enough to offer something really new. Ameche is competent also but dull.

The film is one in the Fox Archive series which means it is bare bones (not even a scene selection) and expensive. The print is OK.",1451347200,,1203,4.792270531400966

8682702,4,B00O9OEBAI,"Since we are reviewing the movie, not the DVD that may not work...mine was fine.  The movie is a nice little comedy that relies more on discomfort  for laughs and charm for its attraction.  It is not a laugh out load or screwball type comedy.  Ameche & Bari with the able assistance of Edward Everett Horton run a failing ""success school"" and pick up Fonda in a contest looking for the laziest man in America to transform and boost business.  Fonda is the folksy, smell the roses type who does more to transform others than be transformed.  Insert the requisite love triangle and viola.  Each actor is really cast in their stereotypical role with Ameche at his energetic scheming best, Bari as the sort of tough femme, and Fonda as the slow talking hick.  A nice movie for fans of any of the three.",1423353600,5,798,4.493055555555555
8682703,1,B00O9OEBAI,"Movie itself is a fun little 40s comedy . Ameche is smarmy , Fonda is goofy and Bari is hot . Only problem is the dvd is defective . I received 2 replacements along with the original disc and all had the same defect. Finally gave up after sending in the last copy . Picture has digital malfunctions  that do not seem to be getting fixed . I hope Amazon fixes this dvd at some point so i can repurchase . Love the movie hate the disc .",1418688000,8,434,3.9318181818181817
