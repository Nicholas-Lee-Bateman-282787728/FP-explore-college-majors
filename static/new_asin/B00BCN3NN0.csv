8566259,5,B00BCN3NN0,"I miss Tom Barnaby dreadfully, but life goes on and thankfully so do the Midsomer mysteries. My two favorites of this series fifteen were ""Dark Rider"", a spooky headless-horseman type story, and ""Schooled In Murder"", wickedly combining a girls' school with Midsomer Blue cheese! Not Tom Barnaby, but still excellent. Sykes, the Barnabys' dog, is the icing on the cake. I'm glad the series is still being made. Cheers!",1406505600,,417,5.057971014492754
