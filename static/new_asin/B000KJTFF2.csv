8157447,2,B000KJTFF2,"Five years earlier, Ranmaru Shindo and his sister Saya survived a very brutal attack that claimed the lives of over 300 people in their apartment complex with their parents among those lost. He has chosen to become a police officer working for one of their divisions with hopes of finding his parents killers. For some reason, there's a connection between that tragedy and a young girl with a sword he sees in his dreams. What does this girl have to do with this event and monsters he claims to see? -summary

Based on the manga of the same name which was written by Tohru Fujisawa, Tokko is a 13 episode anime series directed by Masashi Abe. The main premise involves a group of supernatural detectives taking on supernatural threats, in this case it's some type of zombie like creatures possessed by demons whom devour the living. This type of story is nothing new at all in the world of anime, so you figure it would at least try to stand out in a positive way. No such luck at all, as this first volume containing the first five episodes are about as bare bones as Japanese anime can possibly be.

On the surface, Tokko has the appearance of a Gothic style anime more on the serious side with its mature looking character designs. This goes out the window rather quickly when Ranmaru's sister Saya is introduced and then you start to see those traces of her working as the comic relief, and this right here lies some of the problem.

Saya is annoying with potential to be more of a deep character, as she plays that overprotective mother role to her older brother whom comes off as irresponsible. This brother-sister connection is damaged with the puerile, immature comedy as it teases some type of silly, comical, incest thing going on here. His sister wakes him up with her boobs, and teases him with other things that I doubt most sisters will do. In addition to this, none of their interactions were the least bit interesting, funny, or anything for me. Their relationship is best described as disturbingly creepy. I also do not care for the rest of these clich ridden characters and their overly boring interactions. The only character to so much as generate a chuckle from me is Ranmaru's boss Chief Kunikida, with his foul mouth and aggressive behavior.

The plot follows Ranmaru as he becomes intrigued with these monsters they face, and he eventually meets the girl in his dreams: the sword wielding Sakura and her team equipped to deal with this threat called Tokko. The anime drags its feet revealing smaller parts to the mystery, and the pacing is bad as it jams in more moments of Saya and other bland characters. I found no one in this series by this point I can really attach to and this includes Ranmaru. He's the typical shonen guy that acts as if he's afraid of women, gets in danger, all that good stuff. The small pieces of information explaining the demon threat and what they possibly want is the only interesting thing here, and this needs to be developed further.

The writing isn't at all ambitious and the sword-filled action by this point cuts a lot of corners. There's quite a bit of gore, but the action follows the style of quick sword swipes and falling body parts. This grows old very quickly, and it doesn't help at all that the zombies they face don't feel like a threat. The bullet holes to the face and eyes do look cool though, unfortunately you get nothing beyond that. While the backgrounds of buildings, trees, and hazy flashbacks make good use of the visuals; the still character backgrounds and CG background vehicles look awkward. I'll give credit to the creepy monster designs though; those baby-face looking, parasitic maggots, are something that will stick with you. Whenever I thought of this anime those sick looking things came to mind, they are definitely the highlight in terms of designs.

I am not feeling this soundtrack either; the J-pop scores really do nothing for me, but the series music does have its moments where it tries to work well with its horror-like atmosphere using a static BGM, which works well in the hazy, choppy like flashbacks and visions. Had this anime followed and maintained the dark atmosphere as let's say, Devil Lady, then it would have everything it needs to be awesome style wise.

I've already seen the entire series and I can tell you now that Tokko isn't worth the time, but I'll address whatever I need to in the next two volumes. I'm a try hard to finish this again. It's not going to be easy since the characters are boring stereotypes, the action is about as average as it can be, and although I've seen much worse at this, the comedic moments to ""lighten up the mood"" are more hurtful than anything else. In any case if you just love everything anime then go ahead and try this out. If you're the type who's more demanding than skip this completely because you're not missing anything.

Pros: Can appeal to most action fans

Cons: Characters, pacing, shortcuts in animation",1451520000,,4969,4.656784492588369

If you would rather up close and in your face, you should watch this. With these bad guys, you have to cut them to bits to kill them, but even then some of them just won't die easily!

It's also most of what ""Tokko"" is made up with, along with a generous amount of totally gratuitous cleavage. The first five episodes are mostly to set up the action, but there's some great mystery, gory action, and lots of disgusting monsters right up to the last scene.

Five years ago, a hole appeared in front of a Machida apartment complex. Savage demonic creatures emerged and slaughtered almost everyone in the building.

Now Ranmaru Shindo is on his first day's duty as a cop, when his team is attacked by zombies controlled by shrieking demon larvae. Great name for a band. They're only saved by the intervention of sword-wielding cops from the mysterious division, TOKKO. One of them is a childhood friend of Ranmaru's, Sakura, who has been haunting his dreams recently.

He becomes convinced that the zombies and TOKKO are connected to the Machida massacre... and the strange tattoo that's appeared on his arm. He begins poking around some secluded hospital rooms and a special crime lab, looking for answers -- and discovers an ancient alchemical experiment gone horribly, grotesquely awry. And it may have something to do with Machida.

The first several episodes of ""Tokko"" are basically a police detective story wrapped in some supernatural trappings, with lots of demons, zombies, swords, and some nasty alchemy. Things really start heating up in the final scenes of the fifth episode, when Ranmaru has to deal with something REALLY disgusting.

But it's got lots of unpretentious fun -- it rarely takes itself too seriously, or pretends that it's about anything but hacking up monsters. Aside from the detective work, there's lots of creepy cliffhangers, spraying gore, dismembered bodies, zombies, monstrously carnivorous demons, swords, and (for the boys) utterly gratuitous boobery.

There are a lot of creepy moments, like a mutated demon scientist, the gory massacre at Machida, and those little screechy larvae faces in corpses' chests. But there's plenty of humour there as well, usually from the bombastic police chief (""Listen up, turkeys! We just got the okay to RAID THE CRIME LAB!"" followed by cheers).

Ranmaru is a pretty typical action-anime hero -- sorta boyish and cute, and sometimes prone to embarrassing situations. Especially when his creepily nurturing sister is involved. Sakura and Tokko remain a bit too distant and mysterious in this  round of episodes, but Kunikida is a pretty hilarious character -- a foul-mouthed, womanizing, tough-as-nails police chief who says everything in a dull roar.

""Tokko"" focuses on grotesque monsters and  detective work in the first several episodes. A nice warmup to a solid -- if incomplete -- series.",1197158400,,2759,5.191441441441442
8157451,4,B000KJTFF2,"The first time I saw this anime series was on the sci-fi channel on the Animonday night specials. I thought this was going to be a stupid show and I skipped the first episode, a mistake I soon fixed. I think this anime series is awesome and I can't wait until more of the episodes become available for purchase. Once human, Demon like zombies tear apart humans like tissue paper in a hurricane, blood paints the walls and floors of the surrounding area and the police can't seem to make any headway from the evidence left behind until the Tokko people show up.
  I think it is a little funny that the Tokko team keep making the captain furious and treating him like a child definetly adds to the enjoyment of his situation. The one thing I would like to see more of, and hopefully in the next set of episodes this will be corrected, is much more fighting. I understand they are mostly introducing characters and plots as well as themes but they could have put in a couple of more fight scenes per episode ya know.
  I bought Tokko, Vol. 1 and will soon buy Vol. 2 and hopefully I will not be dissapointed. Great job with this series so far, I can't wait to see more.",1182988800,2,1166,4.310502283105023

A running series about a young man Ranmaru,who along:with his sister survived a burtal murdering spree five years ago,at there apartment complex. As a result both brother and sister became police officers. To better solve the unsloved massace Ranmaru,has just graduated into the elite Mobile Investigation Force. It doesn't take long on the job for Ranmaru- too become invovled in a series of what appearse too be supernatural killings(which are covered up).These cases are insteantly turned over too the secruity force-who inturn enlist the even more elite Tokko force. Which includes another survior from the massacre. As events unfold the prestents of demons & devils(108 via alchemic portal) on earth is reveiled. Acting as puppet masters these monsters,brutally kill humans then release a worm like organizem into there bodies-turning them into,nearly unstopable zombie like creatures. Other discoveries Ranmaru has too deal with are the strang conections his horrific dreams have in common with the Devil Murders,and the strange appearse of a lg symbolic tatoo on his right forearm-which seems too protect him from these creatures,and may land him in Tokko group.
This appears too be a series that going too continuly include GV and possible other adult situtations. Despite being a splatter fest it is not over the top,but deffently not for young veiwers. I decided too keep up with this set by the end of the second show,but like any other series it has it down parts,So I round it off too 4 stars,on a over all bases. Animation of charecters,surroundings and detail,are pretty constitently top notice work. Plenty of gun and sword play throughout.",1182384000,5,1752,5.305755395683454
8157453,5,B000KJTFF2,"We stumbled on this anime online a few months ago, and were quite astonished at how good it was.  Expert pacing, combinded with a suspense filled story make for quite a ride.  But be warned, this anime is not for the faint of heart.  It is near brutally violent.  The only major flaw is, like many shows in their prime, the final episode (episode 13) leaves you on a cliff hanger that is never resolved in the anime, as the show suddenly stopped.",1174953600,6,446,4.337349397590361
