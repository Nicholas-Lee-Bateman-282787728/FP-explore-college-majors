398578,5,6301976096,"""Wind's a funny thing. A man's killed in justice, it covers him up."" -- Lige to Letty

It was Lillian Gish who chose Dorothy Scarborough's moody book as her next film at MGM, writing a four page outline she placed in the hands of Frances Marion. An overworked Irving Thalberg let her pick her own projects and the end result was one of the last great films of the silent era.

Gish came to Bakersfield to film it, choosing the Mojave desert finally for this film about the elements having a life all their own. She also chose Lars Hanson from Sweden to star opposite her in a film many consider to be Victor Seastrom's finest. Eight airplanes were used to create the flurry of sand so constant it could drive men and women to madness. John Arnold's photography wonderfully captures Gish's innocence and then wild-eyed terror at the haunting and always blowing wind.

Virginia girl Letty Mason (Lillian Gish) is traveling by train to stay with her beloved cousin, Beverly (Edward Earle). The worldly Wirt Roddy (Montagu Love) is taken with her baby-faced beauty but they part ways at the station when Lige Hightower (Lars Hanson) and his sidekick Sourdough (William Orlamond) are sent by Beverly to pick her up. The two less worldly men are also enamored of Letty.

Her unusually close relationship with Beverly creates sparks with his loving wife Cora (Dorothy Cumming), who finally puts her foot down. Scoffing at proposals from Lige and Sourdough, she puts her hope in Wirt who, it turns out, is already married. She returns, but unable to go back, marries Lige, who really does love her. He soon discovers, however, that she does not return his feelings, and the two brace the elements until he can afford to send her back home.

It is the Indian's belief that the North Wind is a ghost horse that haunts the film. Nightmarish images of the white horse are imposed against the unrelenting sand beating against the windowpanes. At one point, everyone must race to the storm cellar when a cyclone of dirt rises from the earth to tear across it in a frenzy of dust. Letty's fear of it is palpable.

Attempting to round up wild horses during a dust storm to make the needed money to get Letty away from the dirt and safely home, Lige will return to discover a different girl than the one he left behind. Wirt has taken advantage of the situation but Letty has defended herself the only way she could. It is the wind which has it's final say, but it is a friendly one this time, and a happy ending for a couple now both in love, and no longer afraid.

The happier ending demanded by the studio works in the film's favor. The viewer does not wish to see the elements overcome and cover Letty in a dark cloud of dust. It is a wonderful ending of living side by side with the sometimes harsh personality of nature, which can also be a friend. The final shot of Lige and Letty in a windy doorway is unforgettable. A must for silent film fans and a nostalgic footnote in Bakersfield history.",1218412800,4,2984,4.545623836126629
398579,5,6301976096,"""The wind"" is what we might label as a stunning masterpiece of the silent cinema, made in the late moments of existence of the genre. Not only because gives the most powerful performance given by Lilian Gish, besides his director Victor Sjostrom synthesizes with eloquent majesty the forces of nature and those of human nature.

Marvellous, amazing and breathtaking, this film is among my twenty most beloved movies of these majestic ages.",1217635200,,439,5.097222222222222
398580,5,6301976096,"Lillian Gish plays her usual virginal character thrown into adverse and unjust circumstances, but here she does so much with the part as we watch her slowly unravel and lose her mind. She plays Letty, a girl from Virginia who comes to live with relatives in a dust bowl town. The atmosphere into which she travels doesn't make sense in many ways. The people there supposedly make their living from cattle ranching, but with the constant sandstorms I don't see how anything is supposed to survive in such an environment. However, that is not really the point. The constant wind and storms are just metaphors for Letty's own mental state and feeling of entrapment. Her cousin's wife is hostile to her from the start, convinced that Letty wants to take her husband away from her, and eventually forces her out of the home. As a result she marries a man she doesn't love, and once this is clear to him he accepts the situation and makes it a goal to raise enough money to send Letty back to Virginia where she will be happy. On top of this there is the constant spectre of a wealthy married man who wants to take Letty's virtue for the recreation of it all.

The visual work on this film is spectacular, much like Murnau's ""Sunrise"" except in reverse - this film starts out on an upbeat note with Letty looking forward to the new direction her life has turned, and it being all downhill from there. Thus we come to the familiar topic of the abrupt upbeat ending and how it didn't make any sense in the context of the rest of the film. It was an early example of studio suits interfering with the artistic vision of the filmmakers, and so upset director Victor Sjostrom that he never directed another film in America.

Like Murnau's ""Sunrise"" and ""The Crowd"", 1928's ""The Wind"" is an example of silent filmmaking at its peak. This level of art in movies would be lost at the dawn of sound until the problems with the static camera could be overcome and the novelty of sound wore off to the extent that plot and meaningful dialogue became important. The first problem - technical - was remedied much more quickly than the second problem, which was largely a matter of psychology and experience.

It's a shame such a masterpiece is not out on DVD. I believe that Warner Home Video retains the rights to this film as they do to a host of other silent masterpieces. I hope that they use their rights in a timely fashion and give us a DVD release of this film worthy of the wait we silent film buffs have endured.",1191801600,3,2503,4.472647702407002
398581,4,6301976096,"Lillian Gish evening last night when we had Hambone and Hillie on the one hand (late period Gish where she was brought in like an old mailbox, kept on the corner for a scene or two, then hauled away back to her town house) and THE WIND on the other.  Of the two we preferred the later film.  I used to love Lillian Gish and believed in her and I believed in the sanctity of silent film and all those wonderful sentiments Kevin Brownlow and Louise Brooks wrote about.  But not any more.  It took me a few reels of old style Lillian Gish to get over it.  Everyone knows the story from the title alone, but what you may not understand is that Gish starts to go crazy the minute a breeze hits her face, and it doesn't get better.

SPOILERS.  Finally she gets someone who says he will take her away to a place, a quiet place, where the wind doesn't blow.  Should have been the looney bin if you ask me.  But in a way, she is still a remarkable actress even under the outdated conditions of film acting that seem so ludicrous to us today.  (However, why is it that properly viewed in the proper number of frames per second, etc., most silent acting holds up today, Pickford, Swanson, Novarro, Fairbanks, Bow, etc., all remarkably naturalistic and real--and then there's Gish, acting acting ACTING with every quivering pore of her body--on a shelf all her own--the shelf of madness).  I liked the way instead of becoming more fluttery as she does in Duel in the Sun, her Letty in THE WIND straightens her shoulders more and more, the way Bette Davis sort of acted with shoulders, so that by the time she's really mad she resembles one of the old straightback chairs in my grandmother's parlor.

Her acting choices, while counterintuitive and madly different, are sometimes just meh.  People say she was thrownout of MGM after just five pictures in a row, all flops, but they're not taking into account that audiences just didn't want to see her any more.  They had had enough and they wanted her back on the New York stage or playing Ophelia in the real, Danish castle of Elsinore, and then later on in life they enjoyed seeing her in SNOOP SISTERS type vehicles.  There was always Dorothy Gish for people to warm up to, while Lillian stood to one side, aloof and cold, and perhaps a little disapproving of Dorothy's mad, drunken passion for Louis Calhern, but never showing it--so she was capable of the kind of restraint Victor Seastrom insisted she check at the old corral during the filming of THE WIND.  Much has been made of the tragic ending the suits at MGM deleted, but I'll tell you, if it ever comes to light, and the ominous delay in the DVD release of THE WIND might be a sign that it's in the wind (as it were), I will personally destroy every copy of the directors cut they issue, if it's the last thing I do.",1188864000,2,2817,4.409266409266409
398582,5,6301976096,"Lillian Gish was quite the actress; in this film she pulls out all the stops, as she slowly goes crazy out in the plains (unnamed, but creepy all the more); a very slow-moving film, but one that gets under your skin, just as it does to Ms. Gish's character.

The climax is truly a tour de force for Seastrom, the director, and Gish. The implacable and relentless wind is more than a metaphor, it is one of the main characters, and overcomes everything--except love. It stands up very well to the 21st century.

The score by Carl Davis is first rate, and really makes this film be even better. Don't miss it.",1184112000,3,607,4.410714285714286
398583,4,6301976096,"Other reviewers have more expertise concerning silent cinema, and state succinctly the background of this film.  So I shall add only one small opinion to the others.  Simply this: Lettie wandering off into the desert would have been the better conclusion.  The author of the original book understood this, and wrote it into his novel.  Here's a poor dear that's had so much on her plate: loveless marriage, murder, distate from relatives, horrible weather, jealousy, culture shock, &tc.  Such high drama would dent most anyone's armour.  The sweet tied-up ending might have allowed audiences to leave the theaters relieved and all in smiles, but it doesn't fit.  This is melodrama!  Pull out all the stops and do it correctly. Be that as it may, Miss Gish is outstanding in her role, a consummate tragedienne, as mentioned by another reviewer.  And so beautiful to look at, pure pleasure to watch on the screen.  Wrong-ended and all, this film belongs in your collection if you have any interest in silents whatsoever.",1088035200,9,1018,4.970414201183432
398584,5,6301976096,"Filmed at the end of the silent era, this movie is considered to be one of the last of the great silents. It's ironic that the genre was perfected just when sound was ready to take over.
Lillian Gish, though she faces stiff competition, is generally regarded as the finest actress of the silent era and this film is an ideal way to see her at her best. She plays Lettie, a sheltered girl who is forced to move to her cousin's home on the windswept prairie. Beverly is thrilled to see her but his wife, Cora, is instantly jealous of the dainty Gish. In her few scenes, Dorothy Cummings does a good job of portraying Cora's unfair but understandable jealousy.
Finally, Cora expels Lettie from her home. Since the seemingly kind man she met on the train is already married, Lettie weds Lige, a somewhat silly but friendly local man who is pleased and flattered to have such a pretty bride. Swedish actor Lars Hanson is great in a very difficult role. He manages to come across as likable but one still understands why Lettie is not in love with him.
All the while, the persistent wind blows and starts to drive Lettie insane. Director Victor Seastrom creates a marvelous atmosphere of despair.
The MGM presentation features an introduction by Lillian Gish and has an excellent orchestral score that is both appropriate and enjoyable. The print quality is good. Too bad it's out of print, maybe it will be released on DVD soon.
Good if: You are a fan of Lillian Gish, Lars Hanson or Victor Seastrom (or Sjostrom in Sweden) If you love a good silent film. If you like desert films. (This was filmed in the Mojave Desert, California) If you like psychological drama
Not good if: You dislike silent films, you don't like westerns, you don't like the ending.
On that note, since the relative merits of the ending have long been debated, I will discuss it. This contains SPOILERS so stop reading if you want to be surprised:
The original ending of the book had Lettie going mad, wandering into the desert and dying after she has murdered the man who assaulted her. One can easily see why this would appeal to Gish who was an accomplished tragedienne. However, the ending was changed (there is some debate as to who changed it) and the new ending has Gish hide the body and overcome her fear of the wind and be reunited with Lige in grand Hollywood style. Now, I don't judge endings as happy or sad, just as appropriate and inappropriate. Having Lettie wander off to die would have left quite a few loose ends although it would have been highly dramatic. However there is a point when I as the viewer think ""Hasn't this poor woman been through enough?"" Overly tragic is just as unrealistic as overly sappy. The happy ending answered a few more questions (will she leave Lige or stay and put up with the wind) but it did seem rather contrived. I personally wish that Frances Marion, the scenario writer, had split the difference but that is my opinion. While the ending does not in any way damage the impact of the film, I do wish that it had been slightly more realistic.",1064102400,31,3061,4.547101449275362
398585,4,6301976096,"Letty Mason (Lillian Gish) came from Virginia to live with her cousin's family in the Sweet Water desert that--unbeknownst to her when she made her plans--is constantly plagued be horrific winds.  The winds, she is told, can drive a woman crazy.  Once she reaches her new home she meets her cousin's jealous wife who reminds me of the Almira Gulch character in the Wizard of Oz.  Letty is soon caught between several suitors: Lige, the handsome yet somewhat goofy local (played by the Swedish silent star Lars Hanson, who also played Gish's leading man in the Scarlet Letter) along with his not so handsome and even goofier partner Sourdough, and a cattle swindling codger she met on the train.  Her cousin's obsessive wife threatens Letty to choose a husband and move out or else.  If Letty tangles with the cattle swindling cad she may find herself in more danger than a Sweet Water cyclone.
This film offers spectacular special effects.  In this version, you get a 3-minute introduction by Lillian Gish during which she explains how they achieved the terrific wind storms.  I agree with Gish that the ending to this film is very weak.  The ending was changed drastically from that of the novel on which it was based.  The movie writers didn't do the film any favors.  The ending just doesn't seem to follow from the preceding story line. It seems like they just quickly threw together the new ending without much forethought.  Due to the weak ending, I cannot give the film 5 stars.  The movie is about 80 minutes in length.",1046995200,3,1527,4.720754716981132

398587,5,6301976096,"Truly one of the last great classics of the silent era, ""The Wind"" is an outstanding film throughout helped by an excellent cast (Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson), the legendary director Victor Seastrom and  an intelligent and very dynamic script which tells of a young woman facing  a hostile environment in the old west, a recurring theme in American silent  movies of those days.  The movie is further given a special treatment by  Miss Lillian Gish (probably silent cinema`s most beautiful and gracious  actress), especially in the dramatic climax which almost contains a certain  element of horror. Anyway this is one of MGM`s greatest silent films (in  the same category as ""Greed"") and the restoration by  ""silent"" experts Brownlow and Gill is very good (plus the  dramatic Carl Davis score) .... oh, this were the times when the lion  roared ...",951350400,11,850,4.957446808510638

7818858,5,6301976096,"A cheer for Lars Hanson as well. He jumps across the line between the closed ranks of characters that we see in Shakespeare, Dickens, or modern comedies. When we first see Lige, we see  him as Letty sees him--as a fool, as a bit of grubby scenery, another death to her romantic dreams of the West. On their wedding night the story revolves. Lige, through Hanson's work, ceases to be a minor character and a joke, and we begin to see the story, and Letty's rejection of him, through his eyes. It is he, not the elegant townsman, who is a gentleman. He does so well that, whatever you think of the ending, you can't help but be pleased to see that last image.
What if Viola (a far stronger heroine, to be sure), discovered as a shipwrecked stranger by the Illyrian patrols and forced to marry or die, found a kind and worthy husband in Sir Andrew Aguecheek? That could not happen, could not be allowed to happen. But here we are made to believe in something like that.",1408752000,,966,4.366666666666666

Heads are cut off and intertitles partly disappear at the margins.  This is a wonderful, artful film that needs to be seen as it was made, with the full composition of shots exposed to view, not in the claustrophobic way presented here. The musical score is wonderful.  Gish and Hanson are fantastic, and every second they are on screen is precious.  The wind is like another character in the story.  The black-and-white color scheme makes it seem even more menacing and dirty.  All we need is to see the whole picture!",1303603200,7,649,4.551724137931035

Bu then the jealous wife decides she must leave home. Soon she will have to make up her mind and marry with a man who she initially doesn't love.

But the hellish combination of the loneliness and madness united to the relentless wind and the sand will shock in this original and powerful film.

Indeed one of the golden and last films of the silent era. Lillian Gish was never better.",1301616000,2,682,4.714285714285714
7818862,5,6301976096,"This is one of the great films of the silent era, made just as the ""Talkies"" were on the horizon.  It is gripping and has almost no melodramatics about it, and it's a crime that it hasn't been fully restored and come out in DVD, preferably with the great score provided by Carl Davis.

It is also Lillian Gish at the height of her career, the finest and most beautiful actress to ever grace any screen.  It is her most mature role, after all the adolescent roles she played for D.W. Griffith,  and under the direction of Victor Sjostrom (who towards the end of his life would star in Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries) she is able to pull out all the stops without resorting to the big exaggerated gesturing of the Griffith years.  She can do it all with the biggest, most expressive eyes on the screen: happiness, misery, boredom, and terror.

As a penniless orphan named Lette, she has come from the lush green hills of Virginia to live with her cousin Beverly (A male cousin named Beverly? Or am I missing something) in the desert wastelands of Sweet Water, Texas, an ironic name for a place that has virtully no water!  It is also a place of torrential winds that never cease, and the heady one that is blowing when Lette arrives is just a mild summer breeze compared to what will come later.  Because of the wind, dirt and sand get into everything, even in the food people eat.  At one point in the film Lette is using a box full of sand to wash the dishes in! (We who live in the Southwest often get torrential winds in the late Spring and early Summer, and all we can do is tolerate it while the tourists go on enjoying themselves at calmer times.  Dust and pollen seep in everywhere.)

Lette is warmly greeted by her cousin Bevery, but her cousin's wife Cora has nothing but hostility towards her.  Already the incessant wind is disturbing her.  She is further unnerved as a cyclone interrupts a country dance.  When Bevery dies she is thrown out of the house.  Alone and friendless, she marries a man more out of survival than for love.  The man she marries is Lige (Swedish leading man Lars Hanson), who seems more decent than most of the others but doesn't really love her either.  Their wedding night is a disaster.

So now Lette is stuck in a loveless marriage in Lige's little shack (If you look closely at the papers pinned to the walls you might notice a ""New Yorker"" cover) with nothing to do but sweep the endless sand off the floor. It's a well-known fact that many pioneer women went insane not just from a hostile climate but also from sheer boredom, and that is now Lette's case.  When Lige is called away to round up some wild horses a Northern kicks up, and Gish now displays in her exquisite eyes the blank stare of madness as Lette can only sink deeper into herself while the house is being rocked and pummeled by hurricane-force winds and the sand just pours in.  And when she shoots and tries to bury the leacherous cattleman Wirt Roddy (Montagu Love) -- and he won't stay burried because the sand keeps getting blown off his body -- the look of terror she has is not to be missed.

That was the old school of acting.  Lillian never attended any such thing as the Actor's Studio or the British Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts: her genius was simply that she was a natural.  And she put up with a ton of production crap without complaint.  I wonder if any of today's pampered stars can go through a windstorm produced by eight airplane motors or 120 degree heat for a picture.

And now time for a SPOILER ALERT, so all those who haven't seen the picture and don't want to know the ending in advance must go somewhere else.

Many people have objected to the phony ""happy ending"" tacked on by the studio execs so as not to upset audiences too much.  Certainly the real ending with Gish wandering off into the desert to die (which had been filmed and is still lying around somwhere to be restored) would be more logical, but let me suggest something that you can perhaps think about:

When Lige returns home and Lette seems to recover and tell him that ""I'm not afraid of the wind ... I'm not afraid of anything ... I love you and I want to be your wife."" ...

Maybe THAT'S the sign that she's finally gone over the edge!",1285286400,7,4246,4.400768245838669
7818863,5,6301976096,"There are two other reviews at the time of my writing this, and I echo many of their thoughts.

I watched this yesterday, from a recording broadcast from the TCM network in the US.  I came on Amazon to buy a copy, but as yet haven't found one available - which is a terrible shame.

As for the film itself, another reviewer has given a plot synopsis, so I won't repeat it.  The highlight for me are the double-exposure photography of a wild stallion bucking and running through the clouds of the incoming ""norther!"", a clever double exposure showing the true intentions of the womanizer trying to take Lillian Gish away, and the camera movement used to show Gish slowly losing her mind.  Finally I have to mention a death near the end of the film, so under-stated, so wonderful.

This film came towards the end of the silent era.  After a little research I found out that the ending was changed from that of the novel on which the film is based, but it still was not enough to save it at the box-office.  Apparently critics were savage, and audiences had grown out of the over-wrought performances of the likes of Gish, and actually laughed during the film.  The ending is indeed a little jarring, but to be honest, when a film is this good I hardly think it does permanent damage (and missing the final ten minutes which includes a burial scene would be a terrible waste.

Still, looking back from today, rather than worrying about contemporary views on its release, what we have is an incredible movie with some real heart-stopping moments.  Lillian Gish is simply beautiful, and well cast - her waif like body looks too timid for the harsh background from frame one.  And the wind and sand, a constant character in the film (created by using airplane propellers) is nicely oppressive, even for the audience.

Here's hoping this gets a decent DVD release one-day.  I'd buy in a second.  A wonderful, and yes, brilliant movie.",1267315200,3,1927,4.609970674486804

One of Victor Sjostrom's final pictures in America (thanks to studio meddling that led to a changed ending that satisfied no one who actually worked on the film), The Wind, released just before the emergence of talkies, was solid evidence that the era of the silent film was not entirely behind America. Lillian Gish stars as Letty Hightower, who leaves Virginia to come stay on her cousin's ""beautiful ranch"" in Texas. On the train out, she meets Wirt Roddy (Northwest Passage's Montagu Love), a slick cattleman who laughs at her wide-eyed naivete about the conditions in Texas. When she gets there, she finds he's right; the sere land is constantly blasted by a wind she loathes and fears. When her cousin's wife Cora (Dorothy Cumming) becomes jealous and sends her packing, she is forced to marry rancher Lige Hightower (Sjostrom regular Lars Hanson). The rest of the film documents, alternately, the ranchers' struggle to make the land workable despite the wind and Letty's downward-spiraling mental state.

Do yourself a favor and stop watching five minutes before the end of this movie. (It is rumored copies with the original ending still exist, but I haven't been able to track one down.) If you ignore the ending, insisted on by the studio after it bombed in front of a test audience, this is fantastic. The ethereal Gish is a wonder to watch on the screen, and Hanson and Love are perfect foils for one another.
