8488016,4,B005WLUFQG,"This film is the sequel to ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", which starred Marilyn Monroe and was a smash hit.  Both films are based on books by one author, Anita Loos.  In this case, Jane Russell as a singer and dancer seeking her fortune with her sister, attempts to play the dopey and silly role of a dumb blonde, but naturally her instinctive and obvious intelligence shines through and this really looks absurd.  It is like trying to make Hilary Clinton play Mrs. Nixon!  Hopeless!

That said, the film, now obscure and forgotten, is entertaining and full of music, dance and song.  Not only that, it is filmed in 1955 Paris out in the streets, not just on movie sets.  The obsequious behavior, fake as the French can be, is amusing as they ooze subservience but drip patronizing tones.  Their accents appear to be real in all roles with French required. These French men are also the dancers for the various scenes highlighting our lovely sisters, Connie and Bonnie, washed up cabaret performers of New York, who think an agent called David Action will get them some great venues.

Well, David action is in fact Andy Young, later known as Mr. Ed's owner on the talking horse TV show.  He is charming and can sing and dance.  Their trip to the Rodin Museum with the number ""My Funny Valentine"" has a certain very old charm, as if from a far back time when men and women courted in fine spacious marble halls with great respect for each other.

These two sisters do get engagements but all of them require being practically nude.  They are essentially strip joints of the 1950's Parisian nightclub type. They react with horror to learn that David Action and his sidekick expect them to accept these humiliating dance jobs. Their strange way around the nudity problem is to perform behind mobile screens blocking their bodies's middle parts.  A very odd scene indeed!

As the movie progresses and the ladies remain intent on marriage, they find their two agents are not so unattractive as Americans winging careers in Paris.  The two fellows even steal milk bottles and bread using a bow and arrow from the upstairs apartment window!  They are not so eager to tie the knot however. Their finances are almost kaput.  Our main one, David Action,takes a variety of supposedly amusing day jobs, different every day of the week, such as a security guard at a museum. I didn't find this in the least funny.  When at the end it is revealed by a phone call home, how rich his family is, it is truly nuts.

Anyone ever forced to do all kinds of jobs to get money knows that using the money your parents have could save years of stupid and fruitless efforts. That agency could have been a success!

Hard to say if others would like this film. I like old technicolor films, foreign settings, music and dance films up to the 1960's, and comedies or farces about romance and misunderstandings. I do particularly like the kind of scene where the two sisters are singing away while being cooked in a large kettle with fake black cannibals, with swords and spears, dancing around them.

Some believe this last dance number with Andy Young in a gorilla suit up in a tree, singing ""ain't misbehaving"", was just too politically incorrect.  Maybe!  If that is the reason it is not shown anymore, then all the old Marilyn Monroe and Doris Day films making women out to be dopey morons should disappear, too!",1469923200,,3383,4.647058823529412
8488017,3,B005WLUFQG,"The part played by Jane Russell should have been played by Marilyn Monroe, not Jane. Placing Jane in this role totally ruined the movie in that her fans love, and expect to see, her usual strong lead and those wonderful smart-ass quips. Seems like someone was trying to make her into Marilyn, and that just isn't Jane! However, if you can get passed that huge error ... the film can be fun, I guess. However ... being a Jane Russell fan ... I still disliked this movie ... it slightly marred my respect for Jane's professionalism! As for Jeanne Crain, her role fit her like a well tailored suit. Unfortunately, Marilyn Monroe decided that she never wanted to work with Jane Russell again ... she also turned down working with Jayne Mansfield, and Jackie Gleason.",1322956800,6,762,4.651851851851852
