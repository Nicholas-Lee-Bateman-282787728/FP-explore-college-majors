The setlist is comprised of mostly songs from their first (and best) albums, tastefully sparkled with more recent songs and some covers thrown in for good measure. The set is 76' long and yet there are a lot of songs I'd rather have heard instead of the covers but this singer has an extensive discography and one just can't get too picky especially considering it's a miracle Cherry Red has produced and released this dvd which BTW is the first and only official Toyah. There are 3 DVDs from the early 80s that hopefully will see the light of day at some point but I'm not holding my breath considering this one is from '05, 6 years ago and the VHS tapes are BBC material and they're as tight as they get.

The gig is intense; Toyah may have lost some of her register and her trademark hectic movement around the stage and arm-flailing and gained some pounds but has not lost an ounce of her glamour, matter of fact she looks more refined and restrained nowadays. Their musicians are nowhere as good as the early 80's lineup,esp the bassist, giving the whole gig a punk-cabaret patina . But it's still good enough.

Video : the picture is very sharp despite the low, fixed 4,6 Mbps ratio with some slight, ocassional compression artifacts due to the DVD being a single-layer affair crammed with extras. Edition of the 3-camera angles is very good and lets you see all the action except for the drummer and the keyboardist. Chris Wong plays nice guitar and shreds bigtime when the ocassion calls for it.

Audio : Loud and clear, fairly well mixed and fantastically well panned across the stereo-only sounscape, it's a 192 Kbps AC3 affair. Toyah sounds purposelly lower in the mix to conceal her diminished register, kind of like Siouxsie in The Seven Years Itch DVD except when she shouts her lungs out on some of the songs. Bass guitar is too loudly mixed (and I'm a bassist !)but not to the point of burying any other sound.

Extras include a nice pic gallery, a comprehensive interactive discography and 4 of her best videoclips with original sound. Menues are very basic, of static nature but get the job done

It can be purchased for around 10 pounds so get it since it's already a discontinued product and it's nowhere to be found online for downloading.

Hope it helped. I'm a casual fan, not a hardcore one who will give 5 stars to it just because Miss Wilcox is in it.

Oh, did I mention I enjoyed it to bits ?",1376179200,,2646,4.475103734439834
