33742,5,0780626702,"Like his other great films that relied on the last few minutes of the  movie to resolve the great mystery throughout (like Psycho), this one keeps  you guessing until the end.  As a matter of fact, it's one of those movies  that you have to watch again just to catch all the clues you missed  throughout.  From the first time we meet Grant's character, we see a taste  of things to come from him.  He's irresponsible with money, which leads him  to make some bad decisions - yet Fontaine's character loves him anyway.  Then things take a turn for the worst, and he finds himself deeply in debt  and the world crashing down on him.  His only solution: insurance  money...money that can only be collected by his wife's death - but would he  go that far?  Or worse yet: has he murdered already?  This movie keeps you  guessing until the last minutes of it.  While I agree that the ending comes  rather too abruptly and you feel slightly robbed by the quick resolution of  it all, it's still a great Hitchcock film (weren't they all though?) and  deserves to easily head into the top 10 of all of his efforts.",965606400,17,1105,4.425
33743,4,0780626702,"Suspicion is a movie that has an ending that frustrates some, and pleases others.  Personally, I think the ending is good and appropriate, although it is a little abruptly presented.  Joan Fontaine is quite good (I don't  usually care for her performances) as a quiet, reserved English woman who  marries the irresponsible Cary Grant, displeasing her father who assumed  she would make a wiser choice.  As time goes along, she begins to suspect  that her husband may have killed someone and might be looking at her as his  next victim.  The inclusion of a character that writes murder mysteries  adds to the mood and suspense.  Grant is very effective as her husband,  Johnny, and it's unusual to see him in a basically threatening,  unsympathetic role. Hitchcock slowly drops clues along the way, and the  glowing glass of milk is an excellent effect.  Suspicion is a very good  story, and although it's not the best example of Hitchcock's work, it's  still a good movie by any standard.",951350400,3,988,4.855421686746988
33744,4,0780626702,"In a beautiful performance, Fontaine plays the daughter of a wealthy English family who is charmed by a ne're-do-well wastrel; she is captivating in her playing. Cary Grant was well-suited for his role as Johnny, but I felt the melodramatics toward the end were rather banal and obvious; surely there could have been a more satisfying ending - could there not? Hitchcock is seen in his token cameo halfway thru the film - mailing a letter in a village mailbox.........Hitchcock's suspense thriller is about a woman who gradually realises she may be married to a killer (and may be next on his list). An excellent production unravels at the end due to RKO's insistence that Grant retain his ""attractive"" image. This forced the writers to opt for the usual dull (and rather infuriating) moral ending. Nigel Bruce received kudos for his playing of Johnny's friend ""Beaky"" and there are more than a few similarities in Fontaine's character which seem borrowed from REBECCA. Intriguing and finely played, the movie's end is an unfortunate let-down to some while others feel that it's fitting. As a trivia footnote to those who are interested -
it's fairly common knowledge among movie buffs that Hitchcock actually planted an incandescent light inside that ""fatal"" glass of milk which Grant so dramatically carries upstairs.....It could be said that the AA Fontaine won for this film cemented the practically life-long feud between she and her sister Olivia de Havilland; Olivia supposedly was jealous of his little sister winning an Oscar before she did - to say nothing of getting married first!",947980800,2,1592,5.057034220532319
33745,5,0780626702,"""Suspicion"" is a intriguing film and one of Hitchcock's best;it's beautifully made and perfectly played. The role of Lina McLaidlaw is not too unlike Fontaine's character in 1940's ""Rebecca"".  Johnny Aysgarth (Grant) is the lovable scoundrel Fontaine marries,only  later to become horribly suspicious of him for various reasons. In the last  reel,director Hitchcock builds on every clue, every plot turn; in the final  confession scene, he is dependent upon Grant's skills as an actor;the  infuriating moral ending is expected but nevertheless,  ""Suspicion"" remains a highly satisfying diversion.",944611200,5,596,5.793103448275862
33766,2,0780626702,"This is the movie with the famous scene of Cary Grant carrying the glass of milk up the stairs.  Hitchcock placed a light bulb into the milk to make it look more menacing.  Joan Fontaine did her usual job as a spineless victim (see Rebecca).  The only problem with this movie is that the plot is so addled - whether Cary Grant is a murderer or not is almost beside the point, since he is definitely a pathological liar - not marriage material.",1506816000,2,443,4.313253012048193

33773,5,0780626702,"This 1941 black and white thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock is about a woman who thinks her husband wants to kill her. It raises the questions: Is she right and if not why is he acting the way he does? It stars Cary Grant as the husband and Joan Fontaine as the wife. Cary Grant plays a gregarious lady's man with many conquests, a rake, outspoken, handsome, and penniless. Fontaine is picked up by Grant and is fascinated by him. In a short time, they are married, even though Fontaine's parents are opposed to the marriage. Fontaines parents are very rich. Grant spend huge amounts of money that he does not have, either funds belonging to his wife or money he borrowed or money he stole.
After a number of incidences, Fontaine is led to believe that Grant married her for her money. He spends huge amounts of money he does not have on their honeymoon in several different countries. He rents a huge house for them, which he cannot pay for. He steals a large amount of money from his cousin who was trying to help him. He refuses to work.  He tells Fontaine that he started work but lies. He spends time betting on horse racing and loses. He promises her he will stop betting, but lies. Matters get worse when a rich friend of Grant dies, and more and when Grant is found out to ask how to kill someone with a poison that is untraceable.
Fontaine is convinced that Grant wants to kill her.",1499904000,,1395,4.406976744186046

Although the Cary Grant character is quite different than the book (Grant wanted his role to be more like the book but the studio nixed the idea), it was a pleasure to watch it again after reading ""Before the Fact.""  Joan Fontaine is great, although I suspect she won the Oscar for this because she was robbed of one for her role in Rebecca.  Not Hitchcock's best, but still great.",1499817600,,455,4.392857142857143

33789,4,0780626702,"Supposedly an adaptation of the mystery novel Before the Fact by Francis Iles, Suspicion is anything but faithful to its source material.  Many liberties were taken to make the character Johnnie (Cary Grant) less loathsome.  But to do so meant changing a murder mystery into a mere cautionary tale about the dangers of suspicion, suspecting someone of something that your feverish mind had provided all along.  It also betrays a certain level of mistrust in ones spouse.  That she thought him capable of murder.  At worse, in this version, Johnnie was just a sneaky opportunist, a reprobate, and a lousy gambler.  Somewhere along the way they left out the numerous affairs, an illegitimate son, and the murder(s).  Instead of excitement Hitchcock delivered hysteria and suspicion.

Still, it is an interesting movie.  But the film was not a box office success at the time of its release in 1942.  Its notable for Joan Fontaine winning a Best Actress Oscar, the only actor to win an Oscar in a Hitchcock film.",1489881600,,1008,4.911242603550296

33793,5,0780626702,"Spoilers!!  I always give Hitchcock good reviews.  The way he presents the story is remarkable.  I watched this with my 18 year old daughter.  I had seen it before.  What aggravated me seeing it this time was the story itself.  There are so many red flags as to Grant's character being a straight up dirtbag it's not even funny.  Of course as a dad I'm telling my daughter not to fall for guys like that.  Fontaine's character is just lapping it up.  Disgusting.  What hit me like a ton of bricks is when I first saw the movie, at the end I thought that maybe Grant's character was not as bad as all that.  After all he didn't let her fall out of the car right?  This time when we saw the movie, and Grant puts his arm around Fontaine and gives her the silky smooth explanation, my daughter said ""Did you see that?  He did it again!!""  At that point I realized that there was no evidence that he wasn't a scuzzbag at all.  He merely didn't dispatch her at that moment.

This results in failed schemes to make money and his cavalier attitude causes his wife to become increasingly suspicious of his actions and a belief that he wishes to kill her.

33808,4,0780626702,"Dismissed by critics as ""minor"" Hitchcock, SUSPICION nonetheless has plenty to recommend it.

Set in a chocolate-box English village reconstructed on the RKO back-lot, full of green fields, mock-Tudor housing, hunting scenes and over-stuffed interiors, the film contrasts the stultifying respectability of spinster Lina's (Joan Fontaine's) life with the prospects offered by chancer Johnnie (Cary Grant).

Lina lives in a village world where church-going and hunt balls are the highlights of daily life. Her parents (Dame May Whitty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke) spend their days in their comfortable living-room, either embroidering or reading the paper. They have no need for excitement: General McLaidlaw (Hardwicke) has enjoyed a distinguished military career and has now retired.

By contrast Johnnie, although reluctant to work, as well as being a habitual liar with a penchant for betting, has that indefinable quality called charm (what else would he be, when played by Grant?) Lina understands what a worthless person he is, but cannot detach herself from him. As Johnnie's friend Beaky (Nigel Bruce) tell her, he can be excused anything.

The only suggestion that something might be amiss is communicated through lighting. The two protagonists are perpetually photographed with bars - window-bars, blinds, stairwells being three example - either across their bodies or at the back of the frame, suggesting imprisonment. This is both physical as well as emotional: neither Johnnie nor Lina can be honest with one another. As a result Lina continually suspects her husband's motives.

There are continual echoes of REBECCA, filmed in the previous year - not only with the presence of Fontaine in the case, but also with the use of stock footage taken on the coast from the cliffs looking down at the sea crashing below. The final sequence, where Johnnie drives his sports car at breakneck speed, putting both his own and his spouse's safety at risk, recalls a similar moment in the earlier film. The endings of the two films are different, but the intertexts remain.

There is one memorable sequence towards the film's end, drawing attention to Hitchcock's penchant for the macabre. As Johnnie is abound to climb the stairs, he is photographed in shadow, picked out against a tight column of bright light. Just what his motives are, we know not; but the visual effect is stunning.",1468972800,,2384,5.227748691099476

But look closer: Cary Grant - never more conflicted, handsome or brooding than the miraculous con; Joan Fontaine, in an Oscar-winning performance as the ill-fated wallflower desperate for love; Sir Cedric Hardwicke as her father, and Nigel Bruce, a superb comedic foil. Suspicion is a class act with one minor flaw. Overlook it and you're in for a hell of a good time - period.

Transfer quality on this Warner Archive Blu-ray is top notch bordering on perfection. You are going to LOVE this disc. It's that simple. Buy today. Treasure forever.",1463184000,6,731,5.142857142857143
33818,4,0780626702,"Suspicion has for some time been regarded by critics as second-tier Alfred Hitchcock. Though the movie admittedly never reaches the heights of North By Northwest or Rear Window or Strangers on a Train, it nonetheless is a first-class thriller with two exceptional performances.

 Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) is a penniless playboy who meets shy, reserved Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) on a train. Lina is the overprotected daughter of wealthy Gen. McLaidlaw (Sir Cedric Hardwicke). The general warns Lina to watch out for Aysgarth, believing him to be a neer-do-well fortune hunter. However, plain-Jane Lina falls for Johnnie and, eager to leave the stifling atmosphere of her home, elopes with him.

Early days of bliss turn into confusion and doubt as Lina witnesses odd behavior on Johnnies part and learns about his background from those who have known him for years. The Johnnie she knows is not the Johnnie who gambles at the racetrack, sells her antique chairs, and is fired from his firm for embezzling money.

Director Hitchcock builds enormous tension as Lina and the audience discover one disturbing bit of information after another. With each upsetting revelation, Lina becomes more devastated, feeling trapped in a marriage with a man she realizes she hardly knows. It gets to a point that she fears he is planning to murder her.

The films primary flaw is its happy ending, which Hitchcock hated but was forced into at the studios insistence. This is the main reason the movie is often dismissed. However, Grant is excellent as the man-about-town charmer and sinister, secretive schemer. The movie keeps the audience on edge, guessing until the very end. Fontaine, too, is excellent. This was her second film with the director, having starred the year before in Rebecca, for which she received an Academy Award nomination. She won the Best Actress Oscar for Suspicion.

Picture quality is sharp, nicely showing off the movies beautiful black-and-white photography. Of particular interest is a shot of Johnnie carrying a suspicious glass of milk upstairs for Lina. The glass gives off an ominous, low glow as the camera moves in for an extreme close-up.

Bonus features on the unrated Blu-ray release include a making-of documentary and the films theatrical trailer.",1462838400,2,2282,5.168021680216802

33821,5,0780626702,"""Suspicion""(1941) has always been one of the most popular films in the long career of Alfred Hitchcock and one that still causes debate concerning it's ending. It was one of the first of Hitchcock's films to be released on home video(VHS, DVD) but many of those versions have been less than stellar and fans of the film have been waiting(some patiently) for years for it to finally get the justice it deserves. Warner's(through it's Archive Collection) has finally released ""Suspicion"" on Blu-ray for the first time and it's arrival last week was definitely worth the wait. This is the third Hitchcock film to be released by Warner's this year and like the other two(""I Confess"" and ""The Wrong Man"") fans should be more than pleased with the results. Digitally restored in 2K(by MPI) from a fine-grain master positive taken from the original nitrate camera negative, ""Suspicion"" has never looked better and is an outstanding visual presentation from start to finish(Bitrate: 34.92). There are no vertical lines, white specks, torn or damaged frames and although grain is present, the picture quality is nearly pristine. The cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. is really highlighted on Blu-ray with the the McLaidlaw home being especially impressive. The wood paneled interiors are so vivid that viewers will feel like they're actually in the room with the characters watching the action that takes places. Even the titles of the books in the bookcase are easy to read. Stradling's use of shadows is really apparent now in the famous scene of Grant's character walking up a flight of stairs holding a tray with a glass of milk that glows in the dark. This scene is even more sinister now on Blu-ray! Costumes are another delight with Grant's pin stripped suit and Fontaine's evening dress being very detailed. It's easy to see how Hitchcock was drawn to this romantic psychological mystery and he drops many clues along the way. Years later, Hitchcock told a reviewer that he was interested in what would happen to a wife who ""imagined"" in her mind that her husband was trying to kill her. That is the central theme of the story and Joan Fontaine certainly captures those feelings in her performance as Lina McLaidlaw the repressed daughter of a  wealthy family. One of the most beautiful actresses ever to appear on screen, she displays her character's inner torment and confusion with exceptional skill that rightly won her the Oscar that year. Her co-star, Cary Grant, gives one of his best performances as the playboy who sweeps her off her feet but ultimately cannot support her. His character is not very likable for the most part and is definitely a change of pace for the actor. Supposedly, Grant and Fontaine did not get along during the filming but you'd never know it. Their on-screen chemistry is very apparent and one of the highlights of the film until the very end. And now  about that ending. According to an interview that Joan Fontaine did in the Eighties, the current ""happy"" ending was added to the picture after a preview audience hated the original ""sad"" ending where Grant poisons his wife(same ending as the novel). The studio(RKO) felt that Grant's image would be forever tarnished if he were portrayed as a murderer and therefore ordered Hitchcock to shoot a happier ending. Whether Fontaine's recollections are accurate or not has been the subject of much speculation over the years but there you have it. Despite this meddling from the studio, ""Suspicion"" is an outstanding presentation, even more so now that it is on Blu-ray. ""Suspicion"" is 99 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish, Czech, and Polish. The Audio is English DTS-HD MA 2.0 and Dolby Digital 2.0 for French and Spanish. Special features include a making of documentary titled: ""Before the Fact: Suspicious Hitchcock"" and the original theatrical trailer. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a solid standard Blu-ray case(not an eco-cutout case). Warner's new Blu-ray of ""Suspicion"" is vast improvement over previous editions of the film and comes highly recommended.",1461024000,17,4119,5.038123167155425

There she is, a woman who is pretty and loves to read, however, not the sassy type of girl who tries to impress when it comes to looks. Nothing wrong with that, but not exactly what many men go for. Unfortunately and under weird circumstances she meets this guy, who is...bluntly put...a loser. Maybe charming, maybe handsome but broke because working just isn't for him - and he has the habit of not telling the truth. So despite all the red flags she marries him - and here we have the perfect dysfunctional relationship.

A couple of incidents make her believe that he is plotting to kill her - for money. Well.
As already mentioned, the most interesting thing is watching the dynamics between the two main characters. All I am saying is...you should always be skeptical about someone giving you unflattering nicknames. The end is somewhat disappointing.",1449964800,,1089,4.696335078534031

33851,5,0780626702,"The second film of Hitchcock during his time in the United States won the Oscar he won for best actress in Joan Fontaine's interpretation shows the story of a marriage between a rich and a shy heiress, Lina, who is conquered by a sympathetic Johnnie, a gambler, ""good-for-nothing"" character, player, looking for a good fortune. Lina falls in love, he is attentive and friendly, conqueror and phony with her and through a series of lies about his work, begins to suspect that besides all, Johnny is a potential murderer who is developing a plan to kill he. A generated suspense as only Hitchcock knows is develop by a series of  misunderstandings helping to that suspicion.

Cary Grant,a great actor who has acted in many of Hitchcocks films, (Hitchcock said in public interview that Grant due to his roles could not play a role of murderer) complements greatly the role of Fontaine (sister Olivia Havilland, both Oscar winners).

The scenery (in this case even quite English) and photograph of the environments where the couple lives, Jane's parents, hunting on horseback, her drive along the cliffs ... perfect .are showing the necessary details when required and indicating the perfection of the director not leave any out. With the usual dose of humor and entertaining and funny dialogue.

She could be dolled up to look gorgeous or dressed down to play a less beautiful woman but she was not believable as a spinster. In this movie she was exceptionally good looking. I never for a moment believed that Cary Grant would kill her. Beautiful women should most definitely be kept alive. Cary Grant was excellent as a con artist after money but he always seemed too decent to kill anyone. He didn't seem to have a whole lot of love for Joan Fontaine and he could turn on the charm but he just wasn't the type to kill. I thought he was perfect in the part. You could see how a woman might marry him against her best judgment. What a stunning heel he was in this movie. The supporting cast was excellent as well. Hitchcock's original ending with Joan Fontaine drinking the poison and dying and Cary Grant mailing a letter Joan wrote to her mother incriminating him with her murder would have been stunning. However, Joan Fontaine was just too lovely to kill and Cary Grant wasn't mean enough to do it. Thus, the ending was appropriate with them living happily ever after.

I understand that the pedigree is high here (Hitchcock, Grant, Fontaine) and Oscar did go for this in Best Actress (Fontaine beat out a really strong and tight category) but watching this last night made me question the love for this film.

Why?

There are so many things wrong with this film that Im not even sure where to begin.  First thing Ill say is that Joan Fontaine is actually VERY good here and the most consistent and admirable aspect of the film.  I won't trash her, since shes actually worthy of the mention (although Id contest that Oscar win in a heartbeat).  The rest of the film doesnt fare too well with me.

Hitchcock was the master of suspense.  We all know this.  This was a flop in tone.  I mean, the first half plays out like an awkward romantic comedy, and the second half plays out like a campy thriller that fails to ever truly latch onto fear.  In fact, the end itself is ridiculous, and for that I blame the studio (who censored the real ending and pushed for something upbeat, which degrades the rest of the film and basically sets you up for an anticlimactic conclusion) but Hitchcocks sense of direction here is sloppy.  The tonal consistency is so all over the place that its embarrassing.  Then you have to factor in Cary Grant, who feels terribly miscast here.  He is too charming and jolly, but not in a manipulative way, so you never once question him.  He has vices, but a killer?  That ending feels like a betrayal, but sadly appropriate.

I know that many people love this, but I don't get it.  You can love everyone involved, but a stinker is a stinker, and this one stinks pretty badly.",1389830400,13,1751,4.435736677115988

33912,3,0780626702,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Why did they not preview THIS ending with the preview audience? Hitch would surely have heard surly snarls and sighs with the mega letdown finale and then would decide to re-shoot the original.

Since there were too many scenes with Joan fumbling for her coke bottle glasses, though she attempts to read EVERY newspaper, letter, or instructions without them, I was certain this aspect would be central to the plot. The milk glass glistening in the stairwell was so strikingly a giveaway, why the other lame distractions? REBECCA was truly a perfect vehicle for Joan as she masterminded the role with the greatness of insight but find it difficult to lend credibility for her in this film.

I could not comprehend the attraction to Grant, the psychotic cad who only had to call her Monkeyface 200 times and love conquers all including death??? A huge misstep for Hitch, he at least should have gone with his instincts, but even that would not save this film from any interesting developments. Throw us a bone and reveal the biggest secret: that dang poison!

33919,5,0780626702,"Understand, please. Films of this vintage had to pass a strict morals review before they could be distributed. So just ""flip"" the contrived ending and enjoy instead an exercise in pure film-making.

Lina ""I'm an Old Maid!"" McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine), a shy, bookish young woman with some financial expectations, falls in love with tall, handsome, charming rake Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). They marry, against the wishes of her family.

As soon as Lina gets home from her happy honeymoon, she starts to realize that Johnnie has severe character flaws: thieving, lying, and gambling, for a start. There is one scene in which a rich Mrs. Newsham--who was Johnnie's companion on the occasion that Johnnie and Lina first met--speaks to Lina in such a sneering way that you KNOW she is Johnnie's jealous lover, and I don't merely mean ""ex""!

So what does Johnnie do while Lina spends her time worrying? More shenanigans are on their way. The Aysgarths acquire a house guest, an old friend of Johnnie's. The guest, ""Beaky"" Thwaite (Nigel Bruce, who hams it up to the point of orgasm) is a catalyst for Lina's worst (or so SHE thinks!) possible nightmare. The clueless Beaky drinks brandy even though he's so sensitive to it that a mere sip comes close to killing him. And, on account of a joint investment he and Johnnie have made, it's to Johnnie's advantage to kill him. Lina worries herself crazy over Beaky's possible fate. In due course, she suspects Johnnie of wanting to bump her off for the life insurance. Just turn the ending around (you'll be able easily to figure out what was what we would now call the ""alternative ending"") and use that. Hitchcock was forced into this corny ending on account of the ""morals"" requirements.

A word about Nigel Bruce: I never thought I'd be saying this about Nigel Bruce, but he is SO GOOD in this movie that it would be worth watching just for him. I can imagine him high-hatting a young method actor and saying to an equally hammy chum, ""Let's show 'em how it's done, old boy!""",1384905600,,2020,4.730113636363637

33923,2,0780626702,"Joan Fontaine played the same part in ""Rebecca"" that she plays here: a self-conscious woman with the self-esteem of a Jainist.  I must say she is superb playing such docile doormats - but could she play anything else?  Question - did she win the Oscar for her acting prowess or because the members of the academy felt sorry fpr the character?

  As for Grant's character - how anyone in their right mind could find this cad charming is beyond me.  It is a trap of sorts - if you fall for Johnnie Boy as she does does it indicate you have the same weaknesses she suffers from?  The ending is tacked on and refutes everything we have been watching up to that time.  The ending is not a twist as in ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" - it is a con, it is a cheat and it is cheap.  Hitchcock must have hated having to bend to studio pressure.  Yet even had the film been released with its original (and substantially more realistic) ending some problems would still exist.

  One of the many problems with the script's credibility is Johnnie's attraction to Fontaine's character.  Money is not the motive, as she asserts other eligible women he could have married have much more money than she does.  One might answer that he marries her BECAUSE of her docility, that it is because he knows that she will allow him to take advantage of her - but that answer is belied by the tacked on ending.  She marries him not knowing he has no income.  Really? Johnnie ignores her for months on end and then appears claiming he loves her madly and she, poor pathetic thing believes it. Really?  Had Fontaine's part been played by a callow 18 year old her actions (or lack of same) might be excusable, but Ms. Fontaine was well over thirty in 1941.  Was the script written by a mysogynist?  It certainly seems to have been written by someone not at all acquainted with human nature or, for that matter, humans.  It is too formulaic - every bit of verisimilitude is sacrificed for the plot - and even that is mangled in the last few minutes.

  Watch Grant's face as his closest friend almost dies - pure malevolence.  Watch Grant's face as he hears he gets nothing in his father in law's will - cold-blooded anger.  Listen to Grant's tone of voice when he chides his simpering wife for interfering in his business - self-righteous indignation.  Any man who insists on calling the woman he supposedly loves ""Monkey Face"" is not loving at all, but cruelly mocking; and any woman who puts up with not being called ANYTHING endearing (let alone her name) and stands for it is to be pitied and wondered at.  It is quite one thing for a character to have many sides to his personality; it is quite another for a character to become someone else entirely (smacks of schizophrenia).  The happy ending has not been earned.  If you enjoy watching the doings of a masochist married to a merry sadist who then turns out to be someone else entirely you will rave about this film. Imagine Uncle Charlie in ""Shadow of a Doubt"" showing himself to be a kind, benevolent soul and his niece being a cold-hearted murderer at movie's end and you get the idea.

33955,4,0780626702,"SUSPICION is pure 1940's HITCHCOCK. Again we have a lovely woman married to a mysterious man who she eventually thinks is out to kill her. Hitchcock plays this theme over and over and it never gets boring. This time suave and handsome Cary Grant is the husband and lovely Joan Fontaine is the troubled wife.

Shy and bookish Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) is the apple of her parents' eyes even though they seem to imagine her as an eternal spinster. Womanizer Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) enters her life and Lina is overwhelmed by her love for and attraction to Johnnie. After a very brief courtship, the two are married and set up a home together. Here is the magic of Hitchcock as he slowly weaves a story of deceit and eventual mistrust. Mistrust leads to suspicion. Lina quickly learns that Johnnie is broke and lives on credit and an occasional win at the horse races. His schemes and lies are constantly brought to life and it is clear that Johnnie is a compulsive liar. Enter Johnnie's best friend Beaky (Nigel Bruce) who confirms Lina's fears about her husband. Beaky becomes a rock of stability for Lina as more and more of Johnnie's lies come to the surface.

Our story movies rather story as Johnnie is constantly caught in some scheme. He's not adverse to secretly selling family heirlooms to make some funny, yet, in the end, the heirlooms are back home and Johnnie is back in Lina's trust. Much later in the film, are suspicions raised that Johnnie is planning to commit a murder. Has there already been a murder and is Lina next? Her fears overwhelm him and the last few minutes of the film are pure Hitchcock suspense.

Grant's movie star perfect looks make him an ideal Johnnie. Women flock around him. He could have his choice of any wealthy heiress, yet he chose only a modestly wealthy Lina. Johnnie must really love her, Lina surmises.

There is so much fun in a classic Hitchcock film. His early movies were made on film sets and it's fun to watch SUSPICION knowing that everything, save for a few brief establishing shots, were filmed indoors on a set. The quaint village and countryside were created on an indoor movie set. Hitchcock genius shined brightly because of the great stories and wonderful actors.

Well, period, except hard up ne'er-do- well besotted, benighted, be-, well, bedeviled and be done with it, handsome Johnnies gents who are slightly arrears on their rent or I.O.U. obligation to their bookmakers. They glasses, four-eyes, six-eyes, hell, threes eyes are in play then especially if they are well brought up love-starved country gentry daughters with a little dowry, or hopes of one. And especially when that certain girl, woman, when she takes off said glasses is well, by the ugly duckling turning camera magic, fetching. And that in a nutshell is the lead-up to this early Alfred Hitchcock classic under review, Suspicion.

A few details will help to tell why there is suspense in Suspicion (although not as much as in say the later Psycho, etc. when Hitchcock went over the edge and started to scare the bejesus out of every brave pre-teen and teen boy and girl on the earth by NOT showing us what evil lurked in the hearts of men). Johnnie, well-mannered but broke Johnnie (played by Cary Grant, who else would fit as the downwardly mobile British gent), ""courts"" one plain jane (don't be deceived like I was at first by the glasses) country house gentry (meaning in those days running after foxes, et. al) daughter Lina (played by Academy Award-winning Joan Fontaine), wins her over and they are married. He has no illusions in what he is doing (mainly male gold-digging in order to maintain a studious avoidance of anything that smacks of work and anything that doesn't smack of making a sure thing bet on race day) she, intelligent enough although not really world-wary has more than a few.

Up until that point, and somewhat beyond that point, this film is basically a comedy of manners in the old fashion sense. But eventually Johnnie's gambling debts and thefts start to crowd in on him, and her. And a whole series of events occur that make Lina, well, suspicious that dear old bean Johnnie boy might just get under from under his obligations by putting her under, under the ground. Murder, murder and nothing else is surly in the air. The problem, or really two problems, though are no way, no way in hell can one make playboy Johnnie out as a murder one guy, and problem number two no way, no way in hell, once you take the glasses off, is fetching Lina slated for an early visit to the morgue.

They eventually marry, but it is an uneasy partnership.  Johnny is, well Johnny as she's repeatedly told.  He lies, perhaps cheats and is seemingly out for Lina's forthcoming fortune.  We're never quite sure as Hitchcock loads up the film with more than one McGuffin (glass of milk, Lina's eyeglasses) and tries to keep the audience guessing.  Can Cary Grant really be a crook and murderer?  In any case, the film plods along at times and has a clunker of an ending but is worth a look.

33964,4,0780626702,"So much has already been written about this movie that I just want to say a few things rather than write about the plot, etc.  Read other reviews for that information.

Suspicion (1941) is an Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller/romance/comedy that stars Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.  This movie holds the distinction of being the only Alfred Hitchcock movie in which an actor won an Oscar for their performance.  Hitchcock made so many great movies with great acting performances from top stars spanning so many years, so I simply find it amazing that only one acting performance won an Oscar out of all the movies he made.  Joan Fontaine was great in this movie and deserved the Oscar, but I also think she deserved an Oscar for her performance as the second Mrs. de Winter in Rebecca (1940) a year earlier.  I also think Judith Anderson should have won Best Supporting Actress in Rebecca as well.  Oh well.

Some people have a hard time accepting Cary Grant playing a villain in this movie.  When people think of Cary Grant, they think of him playing a certain type of character other than a villain.  Myself, I don't have any problem with him playing a villain because what it comes down to is something very simple -- you just need to realize he's an ACTOR, and actors are supposed to be VERSATILE, not one dimensional.  Really good actors have the ability to play all kinds of different roles, and really it comes down to just separating what he's done in other movies from what he did in Suspicion and ditching any preconceived view you have of him.  It's that simple.

This is one of those movies that starts a little slow but gets better and more suspenseful as it progresses.  You just need to be patient and let things unfold.  So many of Hitchcock's black and white movies from the 1940s are great movies but are often overlooked in favor of the movies from his prime, which I see as the period of time from about 1951-1964.

This DVD contains a 21-minute documentary on the movie and the theatrical trailer.

Overall, this is a good movie with a great acting performance from Joan Fontaine.  I recommend it highly.  If you're new to Hitchcock movies, I recommend starting with one of his bigger classics from his prime years, such as Strangers On A Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), and Marnie (1964).  If you want to start in the 1940s, I of course recommend Suspicion as well as Rebecca (1940), Saboteur (1942), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), Lifeboat (1944), Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Rope (1948).",1310860800,3,2598,4.70575221238938
33965,5,0780626702,"After his hit ""Rebecca"" for David O. Selznick, Sir Alfred Hitchcock directed another thriller, this time starring Cary Grant and reteaming with Joan Fontaine, who would win Best Actress for this film. I can't reveal the plot details or I'll be under Suspicion. Mr. Hitchcock did fine work here, as usual. The suspense is finely crafted and the drama well-structured. Indicative of later successes, like ""Notorious,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""North By Northwest,"" ""Psycho"" (the first and third films again reteaming The Master Of Suspense with Cary Grant) and other films. Highly recommended. Not Rated.",1310515200,,588,5.4021739130434785
33966,5,0780626702,"Mousy heiress Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) is all too aware that her chances of ever finding her Mr. Right are quickly dwindling.  So she decides to marry the very first man who has ever taken the slightest interest in her - Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), a charming ne'er-do-well who isn't looked upon favourably by the older members of Lina's aristocratic community.  After a whirlwind elopement, Lina and Johnnie return to the county, taking up residence in a mansion which they can barely afford.  Lina realises that Johnnie doesn't want a job when he can just as easily sit at home and live off Lina's annual income.  When Johnnie later sells off the gift that Lina's father gave them as a belated wedding present - a set of twin chairs that were family heirlooms - in order to pay his debts at the racetrack, Lina's suspicion is piqued.  Johnnie's personality seems to be slowly changing, and an ominous, darkly serious side of his temperament starts to emerge.  But is Johnnie capable of murder?

Coming hot on the heels of his first big American success, ""Rebecca"", Alfred Hitchcock's SUSPICION (based on the novel ""Before the Fact"" by Anthony Berkeley) actually carries more of the flavour of his early British films.  Set in a cozy English village with lots of tweeds, fox hunts and stately country mansions, it's comfortable territory for Hitch, who perhaps knew this milieu better than any other director in Hollywood at the time.

Joan Fontaine, who'd previously starred in Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"", once again fills the leading lady's shoes in this top thriller.  This time, Fontaine won the Academy Award for her exquisite performance, but I've got a feeling that the award was also partly meant as an acknowledgement of her earlier role in ""Rebecca"".

This was the first time that Cary Grant had worked with Hitchcock, and the first time Grant had seriously attempted to step away from his light romantic comedy screen-persona.  The result - Grant's performance as Johnnie in SUSPICION - was one of his great performances; and of course Hitch later used Grant so brilliantly in ""Notorious"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""To Catch a Thief"".  In fact, Grant's performance in SUSPICION became so worrying for the actor that the entire ending of the film had to be re-shot, to give the character of Johnnie some sort of redemption.  Grant was so concerned that his fans would not approve of him playing a murderous rogue!

This is one of the most spellbinding and utterly delightful films from Hitchcock's gallery of masterpieces.  Highly recommended.",1308182400,2,2558,4.969483568075117

33968,2,0780626702,"""Suspicion"" is a 1941 crime drama from Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine with Nigel Bruce, Cedric Hardwicke, and Leo G. Carroll. It was based on a 1932 novel ""Before the Fact"" by Anthony Berkeley who is considered the ""father of the psychological suspense novel.""

By 1941 Cary Grant (1904-86) was a major star. He became well known for films like ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933) and ""Sylvia Scarlett"" (1935). But Mae West took credit for ""She Done Him Wrong"" and ""Sylvia Scarlett"" was a box office flop, and it wouldn't be until ""The Awful Truth"" (1937) that he would emerge as a star.  Though generally well regarded (AFI rates him 2nd greatest male star ever), Grant never won a major acting award and received only 2 Oscar nominations in more than 70 film outings. I liked him best in ""Gunga Din"" (1939), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) and ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). This was the first of 4 films he made with Hitchcock, who said of him - ""the only actor I ever loved in my whole life"". Bear in mind, Hitchcock was fond of saying that actors should be treated as cattle.

Joan Fontaine (1917) co-stars as Grant's  wife. She's the younger sister of film great Olivia de Havilland and was a star in her own right. Fontaine was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, and won for this film - the only actor to ever win an Oscar in a Hitchcock film. She worked with Hitch the previous year in his American debut, ""Rebecca"", and among her other notable films were ""The Constant Nymph"" (1943), ""Jane Eyre"" (1944), ""Ivanhoe"" (1952), and ""Island in the Sun"" (1957).

Nigel Bruce (1895-1953) is best known as Dr. Watson  in all 14 of the Rathbone Holmes films. Bruce had quite a distinguished career apart from the Holmes' films, appearing in many British films like ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). He worked with Hitchcock in ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Suspicion"" (1941). Bruce plays a friend of Grant and he gives one of his most remarkable performances ever.

Cedric Hardwicke's (1893-1964) strong voice and stony appearance graced nearly 100 films. He played the evil bishop in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Dr. Livingstone in ""Stanley and Livingstone"" (1939), and King Arthur in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949). I remember him best as the Pharaoh in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). Hardwick worked with Hitchcock again in ""Rope"" (1948). He plays Fontaine's father.

Leo G. Carroll (1892-1972) appeared in 6 Hitchcock films, an accomplishment exceeded by only one other actor - Clare Greet who appeared in 7. Carroll is best known for his TV series ""Topper"" (1953-6) and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (1964-8) but he gave excellent performances in more than 50 films, including ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Wuthering Heights"" (1938), ""The House on 92nd Street"" (1945), and ""The Desert Fox"" (1951). Don't sneeze or you'll miss Leo. He plays Grant's cousin.

Franz Waxman (1906-67) provides the musical score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). At times Waxman's music could be overbearing (e.g., ""Objective Burma""), but when he was good he was great. Waxman is good in this film, using the music to heighten the tension without distracting from the action, and playfully altering Strauss' waltz to fit Grant's behavior.

The film did well with critics and the public. It was the 15th highest grossing film of the year, but garnered only one Oscar. 1941 was a terrific year for films - ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", Sergeant York"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", Meet John Doe"", ""Buck Privates"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""The Sea Wolf"" ""High Sierra"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""A Yank in the RAF"".

Personally I find the film lacking. The cheap sets and special effects that Hitchcock was so accustomed to using in his work at British International/Gaumont are out of place in a 1941 American production, even if it was RKO. And bear in mind that ""Suspicion"" was produced by Hitch, so he couldn't blame Selznick as he was won't to do.

In addition, the tone of the film is shaky. It begins as a romantic comedy (see his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" that came out at the same time) and moves awkwardly into a suspense thriller, or is it really a film about a woman's descent into paranoia. The inability to keep his eye on the mark is undoubtedly caused by the casting of Cary Grant into a film that calls for him to play a psychopathic degenerate gambler to kill his wife. The film follows the book reasonably well with some notable exceptions - Grant's adultery, his involvement in the death of Fontaine's father,  and the ending.  But by taking the threads of the book and removing significant thematic material, we are left with an unsettling story. In later years Hitch claimed that he was forced to accept these changes, but his biographer Donald Spoto claims he was fully aware of the changes.

Fans of Hitchcock or Grant can find many many better films to watch.

FWIW - Look for Hitch about 48 minutes into the film, mailing a letter. And the dog you see is actually Hitch's own dog",1299024000,10,5296,4.7652838427947595

After a brief romance they marry and only then does she begin to doubt his intentions. His closest friend and business partner, played by Nigel Bruce, drinks too much and could die.

33973,5,0780626702,"Joan Fontaine was wonderful in this sensitive film about a shy woman who unexpectedly finds love and allows her insecurities to fuel her imagination with suspicion. She easily won the Academy Award for her performance following her fine turn the prior year in Rebecca. Based on a novel by Francis Iles, Hitchcock's second film starring Fontaine is more about love and the fear of losing it than suspense, but still has enough of his little touches to make it enjoyable as both.

Joan Fontaine is the shy but wealthy Lina. Though her head is often buried in books, her heart still beats, and when she is shown a little attention by irresponsible charmer Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), who calls her monkey-face, she begins to fall in love. When she overhears her family talking about her, the viewer feels her pain, Fontaine wonderful showing through subtle movements and expressions the terrible hurt within her heart. Lina turns to Johnnie for the romance and adventure both she and those who know her thought she'd never realize.

Fontaine is again marvelous as she pines for the popular Johnnie to come calling again, until finally a cablegram salvages her pride in front of her skeptical family. Grant is excellent as the off-beat and fun Johnnie. When Lina finds the courage to tell Johnnie she loves him, he realizes he feels the same and on a rainy night they dash off to get married. Lina begins to see Johnnie in a different light after they have tied the knot when his pal Beaky (Nigel Bruce) comes calling. Johnnie's gambling and irresponsible ways are off-set by his charm, however, and her faith in him is always restored at the last moment.

Discovering by chance through the town gossip that not only has Johnnie lost his job, but may have lost it because of theft, proves too much, however, and Lina decides to leave him. She is writing her note of goodbye when Johnnie relays the sad news of her father's passing. All is forgotten, momentarily, as she now needs Johnnie's love more than ever before, and needs him to be the man of her dreams. When Johnnie's debts become more serious and the sweet Beaky turns up dead, in a manner Johnnie has read about in her friend's mystery novels, her insecurities allow her imagination to take the next step. And when she discovers Johnnie has attempted to borrow against her life insurance policy, there is only one conclusion.

Fontaine is simply marvelous in a tender and subtle performance and Cary Grant gives Johnnie just the right mix of charm and danger. The beautiful romantic score from Franz Waxman was Oscar-nominated. Heather Angel has a nice part as the maid Ethel and Auriol Lee lends fine support as the mystery writer friend of Lina. Sherlock Holmes' Nigel Bruce really shines as Johnnie's likable pal, Beaky, giving a splendid performance. Though some have a problem with Hitchcock's ending, differing from the original source, the sensitive and romantic tone of the film almost demands the ending we get. A very fine romantic film with a touch of suspense.",1274313600,,3031,4.823076923076923
33974,4,0780626702,"Shy but beautiful Lina falls for Johnny, a guy who gambles, loses often, is a pathological liar and lives off other people's money.  After they elope, she begins to fear for her life when she discovers Johnny's dark past and real intentions in this Hitchcock thriller.

Scene:  Is going to run away with John to elope; touching scene when she walks in to her parents room -- dad smoking his pipe; mother crocheting -- and though they do not suspect a thing, she is torn with guilt.  Joan Fontaine's acting in this scene is quite heart-wrenching!

Some humor:  it seems dear Johnny lives off other peoples' money and when asked by his new wife how is he going to pay for this new house, the maid, etc., he says, ""Borrow more!""  When she says get a job, he does a double-take!  Oh brother!

Or when he gets two antique chairs from his new father-in-law, his first thought is to sell them, as he shrugs to the audience.

Suspicion spends a lot of time on the romance and the ""look what I got myself into"" sort of plot between these newlyweds.

But soon, she begins to suspect a dark side to Johnny, a side that may mean her murder at his hands!

He said he had a job, but his best pal Beaky says that he was at the races!  Oh, what happened to the antique chairs?  He sold them to pay his gambling and betting debts!  Oh boy!  ""Well, of course it's Johnny!""

She finds her antiques in an antique shop -- soon after, he gets her a mink, jewels and Beekie a cane!  He won a bit of money in the races.  Lina is shocked!  ""See, that's Johnny!""  Where did he get the money?  She forgives him when he buys the chairs back.

The first half of the film runs like a romantic comedy for sure, complete with flutes and silly music in the background.

But the music gets darker as Lina is finding out more and more that her husband lives off other people's wealth and she's not happy about it.  She finds that he was at the races again, even though he promised he wouldn't and also that he was caught embezzling from his employer who laid him off six weeks before and never told her.  The employer/cousin is played by Leo G. Carroll, who appeared in several Hitchcock films over the years.

Lina has had enough, packs her bags and writes a letter telling him that she is leaving him.  Another emotional scene, as she writes these words and realizes what they mean to her as well as to their relationship.  Touching stuff.  But then she rips up the letter.  Johnny then walks into the room and they have a confrontation.  However, he reveals that her father has passed away and hands her the telegram.

Now, all through the film there have been the comments here and there ""Do you think I'm trying to kill you?"" and other such murderous thoughts that she does not ""tweak"" on until later in the film.

The famous milk scene when an apparently glowing glass of milk is taken up the stairs and presented to his wife.  And earlier, Johnny was asking someone about an odorless, tasteless poison.

The end of the film is gripping and suspenseful.  The beginning though plays like an average tired romantic film.  It's not sure if it wants to be a ""chick flick"" or a romantic ""murder mystery.""

I'm happy to report that Hitchcock polished his skills as a director in the 1950s, but Suspicion, though well done, does not yet meet the bar set by later films.

As a final note, I like the 1940s chaste kissing in romantic films better than the ""eating face"" slobbering of some of today's romantic films and television.  There was more an air of mystery and excitement in these films that one is hard-pressed to discover today in most films.  Some romantic films do have that charm, such as the recent ""The Proposal.""  But these are rare.

Joan Fontaine won Best Actress for her portrayal of the bookish, conservative Lina.

At times I wanted to shake her--she is drawn to Johnnie like an addict to their drug and unable to resist his charm.  Unlike some others, I think Cary Grant was perfectly cast as the charming, handsome ne'er-do-well.

Grant's character, Johnnie Aysgarth, is looking for financial security through his liason with wealthy women.

While secure women would find Johnnie's quirks troublesome--he calls her ""monkey face"" and brags about his scores of romantic conquests on their first date--she falls for his charms and marries him against the wishes of her upper-class parents who disapprove of Johnnie's horse-betting and other unsettling lifestyle habits.

Suspicion is a strange story about star-crossed lovers that nevertheless seem to suit each other on some level. The ending is ambiguous, and in a sense, more fulfilling because of it.

Suspicion is a wonderful film, one of Hitchcock's most interesting, because the characters so at odds with each other, with one taking advantage of the other, destroying that person's trust, yet seem to keep going in spite of it. One wonders at Lina's refusal to leave Johnnie at every, deceitful turn, yet also begin to see that there might be something besides money that Johnnie is hoping to get out that marriage.

33981,2,0780626702,"Cut from the same stylistic cloth as ""Rebecca,"" director Alfred Hitchcock's first teaming with Cary Grant was this disappointing 1941 adaptation of Francis Iles' novel ""Before the Fact."" Hitchcock successfully cast Grant against type as Johnnie  a reckless, irresponsible playboy who marries the shy Lina (played by an ineffectual Joan Fontaine). Because of mounting circumstantial evidence, Lina suspects that her husband is a murderer. Lina's psychological tug of war builds to a ludicrous climax that negates the entire film. If Hitchcock had his way, ""Suspicion"" would have evolved into a disturbing thriller rather than a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, RKO altered the framework of ""Suspicion"" with the same callous insensitivity that marred Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" Another drawback is the lack of chemistry between Grant and Fontaine. In future films, Hitchcock made certain Grant was paired with romantically compatible co-stars such as Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly. ""Suspicion"" should be viewed as a blueprint for a more rewarding Hitchcock-Grant collaboration, ""Notorious"" (1946).",1223769600,7,1114,5.8765432098765435

Lina McLaidlaw is a slightly more confident and sophisticated version of The Second Mrs. de Winter.  Both characters are nave young Englishwomen, swept off their feet by handsome worldly men.  They discover too late that the men they married may be capable of anything - even murder.

After the briefest possible acquaintance, Lina defies her family's wishes and elopes with Johnnie Aysgarth.  Her father has warned her that Johnnie is wild.  Society whispers about his crimes, possibly cheating at cards or being named correspondent in a divorce.  He is a man who has disgraced his name and his family, and now lives on the fringes of polite society surviving only only on his looks and his charm.  General McLaidlaw does not approve of Johnnie, but Lina doesn't care.

Almost immediately after they return from the honeymoon, Lina begins to learn that her new husband is not the man she imagined.  The first revelation is that he is completely broke, living on borrowed funds, and expects to be supported by Lina's allowance from her family - and one day to live in style on her inheritance.

As the film progresses, the suspense is masterfully built up as Lina learns that Johnnie is also a liar, a thief, a gambler, and an embezzler.  His addiction to the horses has left him perpetually broke and desperate for funds.  She begins to suspect that, in order to get money, Johnnie will stop at nothing, not even the murder of his best friend... or the murder of his wife.

If there is a flaw in this film, it's casting Cary Grant as the notorious Johnnie Aysgarth.  Hitchcock once said that one didn't direct Cary Grant, one simply put him in front of a camera.  He certainly has the looks and charm; but is he believable as a villain?  For the movie to really work, you have to believe that Cary Grant is capable of a host of heinous sins.  Hitchcock really strains suspension of disbelief here.

As Johnnie's best friend, Beaky, Nigel Bruce give us his trademark good natured, bumbling Englishman character  -  very similar to his version of Dr. Watson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B000EXZFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>.

Hitchcock is a master with black and white cinematography.  In one of the film's most famous scenes, Johnnie slowly climbs a curving staircase, carrying a tray with a single glass of milk to his ailing wife.  The house is dark, Johnnie is seen only as a shadowy silhouette, but the glass of milk actually glows on the screen.  Hitchcock wanted us to focus on that glass.  Could it contain...poison?

The film also boasts a beautiful score by Franz Waxman built around Lina and Johnnie's love theme,  the Strauss waltz, ""Vienna Blood.""

33988,5,0780626702,"Suspicion was one of Hitchcock's earliest films--and it remains one of his best. The plot moves along at a good pace and the suspense keeps slowly mounting until the final minute or two of them film. People may say that the film, therefore, has an abrupt ending; but I thought it all worked rather well. Only a genius like Alfred Hitchcock could pull this all off!

The action begins when spinster Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) meets Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) on a train. Nothing much comes of the meeting--but they do meet again soon afterward on a social occasion. Gradually Lina falls for Johnnie, especially when she overhears her parents resigning themselves to the fact that their daughter will simply never marry.

It's not long after the marriage that problems arise. Lina becomes more and more uncomfortable being married to Johnnie when she learns more and more about him, usually through a friend or acquaintance. First there are secretive gambling debts and an extravagant house Johnnie hopes to pay for by gambling. Then Lina learns about the theft of money from Johnnie's boss for which Johnnie gets fired. Lina soon suspects that Johnnie may have killed his best friend just to get his hands on even more money. Finally, Lina becomes so worried and rattled with fear and dread that she assumes Johnnie will kill her for her money, too.

The convincing acting stuns me--these actors really know how to act! The choreography is well done in crowd scenes like the hunting expedition and the cinematography shines in the darker scenes in Lina and Johnnie's home near the end of the film.

Overall, I highly recommend Suspicion for Cary Grant fans, Hitchcock fans and people who enjoy watching Joan Fontaine on the screen. Look for another fine performance by Auriol Lee who plays Isobel Sedbusk, a writer of murder mysteries that Johnnie loves to read.

33993,4,0780626702,"""Suspicion"" finds Joan Fontaine in the Academy Award-winning role of Lina McLaidlaw, a wealthy but shy young lady whose parents have lost hope of her finding a husband.  That all changes when she meets the enormously charming Johnnie Aysgarth, who is played with a devilish ambiguity by Cary Grant.  Are his intentions pure, or is he a cad?  Alas, after the two are married, Lina's suspicions about her new husband become far more sinister than that.  He turns out to be a compulsive liar, deeply in debt, and morally suspect; all of which leads Lina to the frightening conclusion that his cold-bloodedness may extend to murder -- first of his best friend Beaky, and then of her.

The story follows the conventions of an early twentieth century mystery novel -- specifically, it feels like something that the venerable Agatha Christie would have cooked up.  There is even a female character that earns a living as a mystery writer, whose conversations about the plotlines of her own books add weight to the parallel.  But what is so ingenius about the plot is that it goes beyond mere convention; imagine that you suddenly find yourself at the center of one of those mystery novels and you will understand something of the paranoia and bewilderment that Lina feels when she comes to believe that that is exactly what has happened to her.  But is she right about Johnnie?  Is her titular suspicion that he will try to kill her justified, or is she crazy?

Sadly, this question would be better explored in a later film by Hitchcock: 1954's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window (Collector's Edition)</a>.

What goes wrong in ""Suspicion"" has to do with the misogynist characterization of Lina and the cheap Hollywood ending that the film slaps on.  The latter is no fault of Hitchcock's -- the documentary in the special features explains that he was forced to change the bleaker climax by censors -- but those who take issue with the former will find themselves agreeing with critics who express distaste with Hitchcock's portrayals of women in his films.  Lina's bland acceptance of Johnnie's faults could be passed off as a product of the times, but when she fails to do anything about her suspicions that he is plotting to kill her it is nothing short of ridiculous.  Ironically, the Hollywood ending comes to the rescue here because it accidentally imbues her with a tiny degree of strength that the original climax would never have mustered.

Still, ""Suspicion"" is a remarkably well made film with excellent performances from Fontaine, Grant, and Nigel Bruce as Johnnie's friend Beaky.  The directing is, of course, excellent -- though to get a full appreciation of what went in to it you should really watch the 30 minute documentary on the film as well.  An example of one fascinating tidbit gleaned from it: in order to make a suspicious glass of milk that Johnnie brings to Lina stand out, Hitchcock contrived to place a light bulb in the glass -- giving it an eerie glow.

Lina (Fontaine) is returning home on the train when she meets the suave, charming, rogue John (Johnnie) Aysgarth (Cary Grant).  He is going fox hunting and sees her again.  He uses his charms to meet her again.  Lina is completely taken by him even though her parents dislike his reputation.  He finally calls her and they meet at the Fox Hunt Ball.

It's a whirlwind romance and marriage.  Johnnie wants to prove that he has reformed and takes a job.  One day Johnnie's old friend Binky (Nigel ""Dr. Watson"" Bruce) and mentions that he saw Johnnie at the race track.  Lina starts to get suspicious of Johnnie.  Things are missing around the house.

One day Lina is out shopping and runs into her old friend Isobelle Lenke, an author of murder mysteries.  She also runs into a couple of missing chairs at the pawn shop.  Johnnie arrives home; he backed the winner at the races.  He has won 2,000.  He admits that he used the chairs for the stake.

Isobelle comes for dinner and Johnnie starts asking her about her books and ways of killing people.  This of course makes Lina even more suspicious.

Things get worse when Binky has an accident and dies.  She starts to fear that she is next.

This was a breakout movie for Grant.  Johnnie is a complex role. He is both good and bad. This role helped him break out of his romantic lead role for more interesting roles.

For Fontaine, this was not a great stretch.  She had just played a similar role in Hitchcock's Rebecca.  But she was stunning in her control of character.

34001,5,0780626702,"Alfred Hitchcock's second film after being brought to America by David O. Selznick was SUSPICION, which he made while on loan to RKO Pictures. As in his first Hollywood flick, REBECCA, he put Joan Fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star.

Fontaine won the Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Lina McLaidlaw, a bookish and innocent (but wealthy) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). After their quick courtship and marriage against her father's wishes, Lina begins to see Johnnie for who he really is--a penniless leech--but she naively continues to love him nonetheless. Johnnie's charm is ostensible, yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable. Lina's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts.

Hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture. The movie's only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which, we are told, was due either to Mr. Grant's popularity during these years or to the existence of the Production Code in effect in Hollywood at that time. Hitchcock wanted a darker ending but, as we see here, he lost that battle. However, he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe. The ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities.

SUSPICION is classic Hitchcock. Grant and Fontaine turn in masterful performances and Nigel Bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable ""Beaky,"" Johnnie's old chum. The flawed ending prevents placing SUSPICION at the top of any list of Hitchcock's achievements, but it is a fine film nevertheless and I can only give it my highest recommendation.

34003,5,0780626702,"This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.

The movie opens on train where Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) sits down in a private first class compartment with a frumpy young woman named Lina (Joan Fontaine).  Johnnie makes an excuse that he was in another first class car but couldn't stand the smoke.  When the conductor collects the tickets, he finds that Johnnie doesn't have a first class ticket or enough money to cover the difference in fare.  With some slick salesmanship, Johnnie gets Lina to pay the additional fare.  This is a foreshadowing of things to come.  They meet again and have a whirlwind romance and get married.  Lida quickly finds out that Johnnie has champaign tastes on a beer drinker's budget and uses a lot of charm and shrewd chicanery to obtain money without doing an honest day's work.  As time goes on, Lida losses trust in Johnnie but later develops legitimate fears that he may go as far as committing murder for financial gain.  This sets up the remainder of the film with plenty of suspense and drama finding out who the real Johnnie is and how far he'll go with his money scheming shenanigans.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for many reasons, but mainly because of the two leading actors: Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.  Not only were their individual performances terrific, but also the chemistry between the two was astounding.  The Johnnie Aysgarth character was a spellbinding enigma throughout the entire film.  Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directed the acting so that it was hard to tell if Johnnie was a charming, but irresponsible child in a man's body or deadly sociopath.  Joan Fontaine won an Oscar for her performance as the emotionally tortured wife.  Nigel Bruce also did a great job in a supporting role as Johnnie's old friend 'Beaky'.  Another wonderful thing about this movie is that there is a clear comical element to the film - especially when Johnnie assumes that his newly wedded wife has lots of money but finds out she doesn't.  The way Johnnie wiggles his way out several tight spots is a fascinating display of his creative and spontaneous ingenuity.  All in all, it's a terrific suspense film with virtually no wasted moments in the entire movie.  The ending is slightly controversial only because we find out in the commentary that the ending was change at the last minute.  Some people would have undoubtedly preferred the original ending.  I'm fine with the released version.

The DVD picture quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old. The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, with only a few grainy scenes. The sound was fine and DVD includes a bonus commentary segment about ""Suspicion"".

34004,5,0780626702,"Joan Fontaine was wonderful in this sensitive film about a shy woman who unexpectedly finds love and allows her insecurities to fuel her imagination with suspicion. She easily won the Academy Award for her performance following her fine turn the prior year in Rebecca. Based on a novel by Francis Iles, Hitchcock's second film starring Fontaine is more about love and the fear of losing it than suspense, but still has enough of his little touches to make it enjoyable as both.

Joan Fontaine is the shy but wealthy Lina. Though her head is often buried in books, her heart still beats, and when she is shown a little attention by irresponsible charmer Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), who calls her monkey-face, she begins to fall in love. When she overhears her family talking about her, it hurts her deeply, and she turns to Johnnie for the romance and adventure both she and those who know her thought she'd never have.

Fontaine is wonderful as she pines for the popular Johnnie to come calling again, until finally a cablegram salvages her pride in front of her skeptical family. Grant is excellent as the off-beat and fun Johnnie. When the shy Lina tells him she loves him, he realizes he feels the same and they run off and get married one rainy night.

Lina tries to be happy but begins to see Johnnie in a different light when his pal Beaky (Nigel Bruce) shows up. Johnnie's gambling and irresponsible ways are off-set by his charm, however, and her faith in him is always restored, as when he buys back a family heirloom he has sold when he hits it big at the track.

Lina learns through the town gossip that not only has Johnnie lost his job, but may have lost it because of theft, and decides to leave him. She is writing her note to him when Johnnie breaks in to tell her the sad news of her father's death. All is forgotten for a time as she needs Johnnie more than ever.

When Johnnie's debts become serious and the sweet but slow Beaky turns up dead, in a manner Johnnie has read about in her friend's mystery novels, her insecurities allow her imagination to take the next step. And when she discovers Johnnie has attempted to borrow against her life insurance policy....

Fontaine is simply marvelous in a tender and subtle performance and Cary Grant gives Johnnie just the right mix of charm and danger. The beautiful romantic score from Franz Waxman was Oscar nominated. Heather Angel has a nice part as the maid Ethel and Auriol Lee lends fine support as the mystery writer friend of Lina. Nigel Bruce, of Sherlock Holmes fame, really shines as Johnnie's pal Beaky.

Though some have a problem with Hitchcock's ending, the sensitive and romantic tone of the film almost demands the ending we get. A very fine romantic film with a touch of suspense.",1122681600,63,2768,4.6138211382113825
34005,4,0780626702,"Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are great in this film.  Fontaine does an excellent job playing the madly in love wife who strongly suspects her husband wants to kill her and collect the money from her insurance policy.  The DVD comes with a documentary that details the production of the film, and the controversy surrounding the original ending of ""Suspicion,"" which had to be changed at the very last minute.  The movie you see on the screen was heading towards a different ending, so the one it has now seems somewhat out of place.  But Fontaine's acting saves the new ending with a beautiful performance and, eventually, winning her an Oscar because of it.  As far as the narrative goes, if the original ending were to have made the final cut, the film would have had a similar conclusion like that of ""The Paradine Case,""  where the surprise would have been muted and the film would have lost its overall strength.  ""The Paradine Case"" falls flat in the end--ruining what was a really well acted film.  ""Suspicion,"" with the change of its ending, brought a different conclusion that, even though the denouement appears to be slapdash and out of place, at least salvages the story as a whole rather than sink it.  The new ending also exemplifies the power of Hitchcock's ability as director to erase any suggestion of imperfection by presenting the audience with a thrilling car sequence along a bluff and giving us a memorable moment in cinema history.",1112400000,4,1455,4.764940239043825

In fact, every actor in it was perfect and excellent.  Okay.  Why did I only give it 4 stars?  Because (like Rebecca), Hitchcock spends nearly an entire hour (the whole thing (thank god) is only 99 minutes long) setting the stage, establishing with incredible repetition the rationale for Fontaine's fears and suspicions (plus the courtship was a little tedius too, I thought).  But when Watson comes into the plot, it is terrific!  Of course you know (or will if you read these other reviews) how it will end.  But I have never seen Grant play a malevolent, sinister character before, and he did it wonderfully.  And I've never seen him play someone so inherently unlikeable before.  As my friend said, he was ""obnoxious.""  And as another reviewer said, I wouldn't love someone who called me ""monkey face""!  Again like Rebecca, the last 20 minutes or so were breathtaking, fascinating.  I loved the ending.  I thought it was perfectly done (though unfortunately with Hitchcock's customary fake outdoor shots), all the loose ends were tied up and everything fell into place.  And I liked the very end just before the screen went blank (I won't say what it was), I thought it was perfect, wordless.  However, I read (you can too) the complete description of Hitchcock's original ending in another review.  I don't know now which I prefer, both I think are perfect.

34012,4,0780626702,"Following quickly on the heals of her success in ""Rebecca"" Joan Fontaine scored the coveted Best Actress Oscar for her role as Lina McLaidlaw in ""Suspicion"" (1941), a bizarre and disturbing romantic mystery. Beneath her bookish exterior Lina's a repressed soul. But her traditional reservations are merely a faade for lusty home fires that seem to be sparked to satisfaction in her encounter with handsome playboy, Jonnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). The two soon marry. However, as the romance progresses Jonnie seems to be more than just an elegant rogue. Could it be? Is he a murderer?  Brimming with Hitch's corrosive ambiguities that slowly begin to erode Lina's trust in her new husband, ""Suspicion"" plays tricks on both Lina and the audience's collective understanding of where Jonnie intends to take us with his brooding thoughts and sinister glass of glow-in-the-dark milk.  This is a deeply unsettling, wickedly concocted puzzle; a film that plays more for enigma than plot and tease rather than substance, but it works on every level to tantalize like a car wreck that one is not involved in yet is strangely compelled to.

Warner's DVD transfer exhibits a balanced gray scale with deep, solid blacks and reasonably clean whites. Dirt, scratches and other age related artifacts are present but do not terribly distract.

He marries a young but wealthy ingenue, Joan Fontaine. He is patently and without remorse after her inheritance. Fontaine quickly realizes the type of jerk she has married. She even starts to suspect that Grant is out to kill her! The plot further thickens when Grant's buddy, actor Nigel Bruce, dies suddenly on a business trip with Grant. We wait for one of those English detectives that Hitchcock casts so well to haul Grant off to jail. And then? Then there is that famous car ride that ends the movie so abruptly and has given other reviewers fits. It is all too true that ""Suspicion"" ends quickly with no clear-cut resolution. We are left with no clue if the couple divorced, lived happily ever after or if Grant finally got tossed in a British cooler. The abrupt and unresolved ending is similar to ""Notorious"". This reviewer has no problems with murky endings. Why not appreciate them ""as is""? Some interesting sidebars: 1)""Suspicion"" was filmed with an entirely British cast on a Hollywood lot, nowhere close to the English seashore. 2) Grant was said to be furious at the Director because Hitchcock allegedly was very patient with Fontaine but hassled him during production.  3) Ms Fontaine won a 1941
Best Actress Oscar for her role, making her the ONLY actor/actress to be so recognized for a Hithcock film. The recommendation from this reviewer is to enjoy ""Suspicion"" for what it is-an above average suspense film with perhaps a hole or two in it. Viewers should ignore the fact that Grant and Hitchcock have done better work elsewhere. They might also ignore the fact that RKO Pictures changed the ""original"" ending. That scarcely makes Hollywood history. Why not just calm down and watch the movie? ""Suspicion"" should stand alone on its' own merits.",1074297600,3,2064,4.8914285714285715
34014,4,0780626702,"There are no directors better than Alfred Hitchcock in setting a mood of menace or a string of clues that point to some truly climactic ending.  In SUSPICION, Hitchcock presents a view of good guy Cary Crant as a leering, lying, cad who may be guilty of even worse criminal behavior.
Grant is Johnnie, who opens as the Cary Grant his fans have always known: suave, handsome, dashing.  Joan Fontaine is Lina, a rather bookish frump who nevertheless catches Johnnie's eye. Early on, Johnnie's interest in Lina is at least partly based on her family fortune.  When the audience sees Grant going against type by playing the caddish Johnnie, they can see that behind the smiling eyes and suave grin lay a twist that no one would have believed.  Director Hitchcock slowly builds up the character of Johnnie by innuendo.  At each step of the way, Lina hears and sees the implied charges, but she always tries to find a rational answer that does not point toward what the audience sees as the inevitable truth.  Nigel Bruce as Beaky, a childhood chum of Johnnie's, supplies the same innocent charm that he displayed earlier as Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes series.  Here as Beaky, Bruce reinforces the twin nature of Johnnie: that is one must accept his negative side if one is to as readily accept his positive.  With each revelation, first from Beaky, then from Johnnie's employer (Leo G. Carroll), the mounting evidence accrues to convince Lina that her husband is guilty of a series of crimes ranging from theft, to deception, to murder.  The famous scene in which Johnnie brings Lina a glass of glowing milk indelibly etches in the audience's collective mind the conviction that Johnnie is indeed the creep that he appears to be.
Unfortunately, Hitchcock could not allow the reputation of Cary Grant to be tarnished by ending the movie on the affirmation of a guilt that he had spent the better part of two hours so carefully constructing.  The turn about of the closing scene leaves the viewer gasping in disbelief.  Even if that viewer accepts the glib explanation of Johnnie of his true motivation, then this acceptance still leaves him as the same cad he was at the start of the film.  Still, Joan Fontaine as Lina managed to snare an Oscar for best actress.  SUSPICION is the kind of quality film that except for the last minute manages to engage the viewer in a race against time during which one woman must balance her feelings against mounting suspicions against a man whose charm is source both of her love and her deepest fears.",1070755200,,2539,4.73015873015873
34015,4,0780626702,"Cary Grant (Johnnie Aysgarth) was 37 when this was released and perhaps at the pinnacle of his sexual charm (but not at the pinnacle of his career by a long shot); and Joan Fontaine (Lina Aysgarth--not ""Linda,"" as the video jacket mistakenly has it), 24, was fresh from her very fine performance in Rebecca (1940) alongside Laurence Olivier, also directed by Alfred Hitchcock, for which he garnered his only Best Picture Oscar.  I don't think this film is nearly as good.  It is saved from being something close to annoying at times only by the star power of the leads and a fine supporting cast, especially Nigel Bruce (best known perhaps as Dr. Watson in a number of Sherlock Holmes films) as Cary Grant's friend ""Beaky.""
The problem with the film lies partly with the casting of Cary Grant, although not in his performance as such.  He was seen as such a valuable property by the studio that the proper ending of the film was considered inappropriate and so it was changed.  Along the way we see a lot of mixed foreshadowing so it is impossible to tell whether his character is that of a loving husband who is a bit of a rogue or a cold-blooded murderer who married Lina for her inheritance and intends to kill her.  We can see how the latter possibility might not work so well since she was only getting a subsistence allowance from the will of her father who disapproved of the marriage.  And there are all those dark scowls that Grant manufactures, somewhat awkwardly I must say, to keep us in doubt.  What is apparent is that Hitchcock had one ending in mind and then had to change it and wasn't able to redo some of the earlier scenes that worked better with the old ending.
At any rate, Joan Fontaine is very good, lovely, graceful and focused.  With this performance she went one up on her older sister Olivia de Havilland by winning the Best Actress Oscar.  And it is a bit of a spicy treat to see Cary Grant as something of a heavy, at least part of the time.  For most of us, who have seen him in many films, his character has always been sterling.
I must also note that some of the production seems a bit unnatural.  Grant wears his suit and tie all buttoned up even when visiting Fontaine in their bedroom (carrying the infamous glass of milk, which I understand was backlighted with a bulb inside the glass to make it almost glow).  Fontaine's Lina appears mousey and bookish at the beginning (it is suggested that she was in danger of being an old maid!) but later develops a more sophisticated style.  And I don't think Hitchcock or Grant really gave her enough cause for the sort of fear she experienced.  The final scene with its quick about-face was not entirely convincing or conclusive either.
Contemporary audiences might wince at the plodding direction by Hitchcock.  They might even wonder why he decided to make a movie from such a familiar and lightly plotted tale not far removed psychologically from a romance novel.  But Hitchcock always erred on the side of giving the mass audience what he thought they wanted.  What they wanted here was Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine together romantically with some mystery and doubt along the way.",1049932800,5,3164,4.581560283687943
34016,5,0780626702,"Suspicion has all of the qualities of a great film, and then some.  It's romantic, mysterious, and with much suspence throughout the whole film.

34018,5,0780626702,"Cary Grant stars as Johnny, a well-bred, but penniless English playboy, who meets, woos, and quickly weds ugly-duckling hieress Lina (Joan Fontaine).  Soon after the honeymoon, Lina discovers that Johnny is a financial scoundrel.  His old schoolchum, the wealthy and bumbling Binky, goes into business with Johnny, but Lina suspects Johnny may be planning Binky's murder...and her own.

Cary Grant is gorgeous as the suave charmer who drives all the ladies wild and Joan Fontaine is perfect as the doudy spinster he chooses for his scam/love-interest(?).  There are many thrilling moments where it appears Johnny is methodically plotting his bride's murder. It's a wonderful film you can enjoy over and over again, thanks to the two talented stars and the delightfully intense script.",1041206400,4,784,5.349593495934959
34019,4,0780626702,"Suspicion is a great film, as are most Alfred Hitchcock films. It features two talented classic stars, Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine, and is very suspenseful and chilling. Although this film could have been much better had the ending been different, it is still quite good as it is, especially because of Grant's amazing (but much ignored) performance as Johnny.
Essentially, Suspicion is the story of a bookish, shy English girl (Joan Fontaine) who falls in love with a charming but irresponsible man named Johnny (Cary Grant). As the film progresses, the audience begins to suspect Johnny of more than simply gambling and being irresponsible, which raises the question - are the suspicions justified or is ""Monkey Face"" (what Johnny calls his wife) just being paranoid?
The film progresses, building to a seemingly unforgettable conclusion - but then suddenly, and very unconvincingly, Johnny is vindicated! In my opinion, this ending, while still making Suspicion a great film and enjoyable to watch, really detracts from the overall effect. I feel that Hitchcock's original ending, in which Johnny gives his wife the poisoned milk, she drinks it, but writes a letter beforehand saying that she knew he was going to murder her, would have been far more effective. Sadly, however, because of Grant's matinee-idol appeal, the studio did not allow Hitchcock to cast him as a murderer (they feared it would hurt his popularity).
Anyhow, even though it is frustrating that Grant was so constrained by the studios and by his own persona, Suspicion is still a good film as it is, and is totally worth seeing!",1029715200,7,1603,5.052830188679246
34020,2,0780626702,"First off let me warn you that the colourised version of this movie is SO BAD. If you buy it make sure you get the black and white version. The colourised one looks like someone... a five year old child... took paint and slapped it all over the film. It's awful.
Second of all let me warn you that this is NOT one of the best Hitchcock films. I find it really aggravating at moments, because Cary Grant's character drives me looney with his incessant fibbing and calling Lina ""monkeyface"". I did like the hairdo he gave her. Overall his acting is annoying here. In his other three Hitchcock films - Notorious, North by Northwest, and To Catch a Thief - he was much better. Joan Fontaine is basically the same character as she played in Rebecca, except that here it is rather tiring to watch her simper and swoon and be all sentimental over her man... In Rebecca I felt the role called for all that naive schoolgirl stuff. Here it isn't right. Ingrid Bergman could have done wonders for this movie...
I can say some positive things too, however. The costumes were lovely - what I could see of them under the sloppy colourisation. The story itself was quite good as well, except of course the controversial ending... which personally I felt was just one last lie from Cary and that he did kill her after they got home. Far too abrupt, whatever it was supposed to mean. The guy who played Beaky was one of the best characters - at least I didn't feel like he was acting. The murder mystery writer lady was good in her part, and her mortician brother was as well.
It would have been nice to have a bit more development with the characters. In most every other Hitchcock film, you know what they think and how they feel... here I was never sure.

Take the movie for what is is, instead mulling over how the studio changed the ending. The ""new"" ending works marvelously and is especially shocking if you've seen the rest of Hitchcock's catalogue--some of Hitchcock's movies tend to end predictably, but not so with Suspicion. The ending is a bit rushed, but it works. Grant and Fontaine rule it.  Rent this movie or buy it instead of Mixed Nuts.",984182400,2,500,4.681818181818182

Watch this movie for what it was: a thriller that defied conventions of stardom and played with the leading man image, not the comfortably safe mess the studio made of it when Hitchcock went back to England.  This is my favorite Hitchcock movie because of what it was supposed to be.  Please keep the studio's butchering in mind when you watch it and think only of Hitchcock's wonderful finale that we will never get to see.",970444800,7,628,4.3418803418803416

I'm  shocked to say very weak performances by two of hollywood's biggest  stars(well,at one time anyway)Grant and Fontaine! And Hitchcock's directing  isn't up to the usual hugh standard I expect from him. I really can't  understand how other reviews can say so many good things about this film.  I'm a big Hitchcock fan myself,but I chose to forget I every saw this film  in the first place,and just remember Hitchcock for his several other great  films.

A man enter a train compartment and meets a woman. He has a Third Class ticket in the First Class car. He borrows the fare from the woman. [Nerve?] She sees a picture in a newspaper. We see Johnny at a sporting event - riding to the hounds. Later he meets a woman and invites her to church. There is a discussion in the country, he fixes her hair. She overhears people talking about her. There was a scandal about Johnny Aysgarth. Line telephones Johnny. There is a formal dance. Johnny shows up without an invitation but invites himself in. [Does the name monkeyface suggest his flaws?] Johnny romances Lina. They have a drink, Johnny talks some. Then they visit the Registrar. Next its Naples, Monte-Carlo, Venice, and Paris before returning to England and a new home. They have a young maid. Johnny gets a telegram, he owes 1,000 to a man. The talk tells about Johnnys personality and expectations.

Can Johnny go to work? He explains the problems. Two chairs are a wedding gift from General McLaidlaw. Beaky, an old friend of Johnnys, drops by for a visit. He was Johnny at the race track. Where are those chairs? Will Johnny invent a story? He explains the sale. Line sees those chairs in a shop window! Johnny splurges on gifts for Lina. Johnny won big on a horse race. Lina is disappointed until she learns Johnny bought back those chairs. A drink causes Beaky to have a medical problem. Johnny loves to read detective novels. He still visits the races. Line visits his cousin Melbeck, and learns he was fired six weeks after there was a loss of 2,000! Lina decides to leave Johnny , she knows about the firing. Johnny has plans to develop real estate, if he can get the money from Beaky. Johnny reprimands Lina for asking questions.

Later Johnny tells Lina hes calling off the deal. Lina imagines Beakys fate and faints! The next morning she drives to that location, then returns home. She learns about a near accident. Two policemen call on Lina, Thwaite was found dead in a house in Paris. His companion was unknown. Johnny returns and is told about Beaky. Johnny calls the Wickstead police. Lina learns about some true crime cases. Johnny borrowed a book. Lina learns about an insurance policy. There is a dinner, they discuss murders. Is there a poison that cant be traced? Lina was given a sleeping pill and slept all day. Johnny learned about an untraceable poison. Johnny brings her a glass of milk. Goodnight. Lina decides to visit her mother, Johnny wants to drive her. There is a near accident! Johnny admits his intention to Lina, they return home.

This was adapted from the novel Before The Fact by Francis Iles, but with a changed ending for customer expectations (a murderer could not escape justice in a movie). Johnny seems to be a psychopathic personality who uses people. This is why money goes to money in marriages, to avoid fortune hunters like Johnny or others who don't fit in. But sometimes love or emotion overrides reason. This story is a warning about people like Johnny. Marry in haste, repent in leisure. Why was Lina unmarried?
