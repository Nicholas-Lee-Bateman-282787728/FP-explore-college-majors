4395876,4,B004K7M6ZG,My side was hurting I laughed so hard watching this DVD!,1405641600,,56,4.181818181818182
4395877,5,B004K7M6ZG,"I saw this video just a few hours ago and I found it be absolutely brilliant.  Lovitz has picked an interesting and surprising bunch of unknown comedians who are fantastic.  I can't recommend this video highly enough.  Although all of the comedian are excellent, my particular favorites were Daryl Wright and Ian Bagg.  FYI... for those who care, a lot of the stuff on this video is not family friendly or politically correct, but it's friggin awesome!!  BUY ONE NOW!!! You will not regret it.",1303603200,,493,4.752941176470588
8432516,5,B004K7M6ZG,Would have been a 4 without Daryl Wright. Funny stuff but not for kids.,1524787200,,71,4.142857142857143
8432517,4,B004K7M6ZG,"Quinn Dahle and Daryl Wright get 5 stars, whle everyone else (including Lovitz) gets four.  Very politically incorrect humor, which is another way of saying ""great humor.""  Not for avacado-toast munching Millennials.  You should probably have a sense of humor, the firsst term of which is ""sense,"" before wading into this one.  The story about the Klan comedy performance, I will never forget.",1520640000,,393,5.190476190476191
8432518,1,B004K7M6ZG,"Jon was the one and only highlight of the bunch, the one true star (out of five!). The rest were not quite memorable at best, and lewd at worst.",1507334400,,144,4.0
8432519,1,B004K7M6ZG,"This was a mix of 4 or 5 guys so 1 star for Daryl Wright who was real good, everyone else was a real sink hole.",1505606400,,111,3.3076923076923075
8432520,5,B004K7M6ZG,"Not a lovitz fan (nor detractor) per se- this was hilarious, and he lined them up perfectly, Bagg is far and away the funniest- looking for more stuff of his immediately",1504828800,,169,4.483870967741935
8432521,5,B004K7M6ZG,Jon Lovitz was funny as ever and he presented some amazing comics who did not disappoint for the most part.  I especially liked Darryl's material and delivery.,1504483200,,159,4.888888888888889
8432522,5,B004K7M6ZG,"Hilarious! The second guy wasn't funny, just dirty, but the rest were great. It was very ""Saturday Night Live"" -ish. Awesome.",1504310400,,125,5.0
8432523,5,B004K7M6ZG,1 comic was oh okay? But the rest was funny as hell!!,1483747200,,53,3.5
8432524,5,B004K7M6ZG,"I bought this DVD as I had seen Ian Bagg perform in person multiple times. I also have both of his CDs. Ian is funny as expected, he is good at crowd work like 'cranky won't talk to me'. I also liked 'that's a turkey', 'miss that kid more than her', 'hose moves', 'Sarah Palin', and 'what month are you on the calendar?'
  I also left impressed with the comedy of Daryl Wright. Jokes like 'get over yourself', 'only stole the stove', 'no more excuses Obama is president', 'dog didn't read me my rights', 'try business casual', 'a show for the Klan', and 'it means they lost' work for me.
  In addition, I liked all of the previews for other DVDs that were included, and I plan on getting the one by Louie Anderson real soon.",1440806400,,724,4.301470588235294
8432525,5,B004K7M6ZG,Great host...4 great and unique comedians.  Laughed out loud many times while watching this.,1432080000,,92,5.571428571428571
