8027546,4,B0002F6BOW,"Angelitos Del Trapecio is a fun, breezy comedy about Viruta and Capulina, two men who sell ""medicine"" at a carnival. Viruta and Capulina help two lovely, female acrobats(Annabelle Gutierrez and Maricruz Olivier)after their father breaks his leg! That song Viruta and Capulina sing is catchy! The script was penned by Roberto Gomez Bolanos(also known as Chespirito). Chespirito was a Mexican comedy skit TV show in Mexico in the sixties; two of his creations, El Chavo and El Chapulin Colorado, got their own TV shows in the 70's.
 The late Olivier looks so sexy in this film. She looks like a Flash Gordon villainess in her leotards. Annabelle Gutierrez is so adorable. I hope home video companies dig up some of her other movies in the future. One has to face the facts. Mexican movies are printed on celluloid and nitrate film stock. Over time, these prints will rot, disintegrate, turn into jelly, or burst into flames! Who knows? Thousands of Mexican films may already be lost. Well, back to movie. Viruta and Capulina were like the Martin and Lewis of their time. They even had their own comic book. Years later, Capulina ended up with a solo career. Capulina is like Chris Farley and John Belushi minus the raunchy humor and foul language.
This DVD is worth every penny of its $12 price tag.",1235347200,2,1297,4.790178571428571
