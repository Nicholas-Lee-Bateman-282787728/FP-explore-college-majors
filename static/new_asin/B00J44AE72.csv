I didn't know what to expect from this dvd, but was half expecting her to have this ""air-head"" stripper persona, since I really didn't know much about her. I can honestly say I LOVE her! She's fun and down to earth, and equally enjoyable to watch! I was also unaware that this dvd includes a toning segment as well, so she really does cover all the important things to make these moves work. She starts with a warm up, then the moves, then toning exercises, and finally a stretch. This dvd is definitely being added to my workout routine.",1523404800,,708,4.5390625

She makes sure to address the fact that you won't be a ""butt master"" right away, but that it will come with time and practice. I appreciate someone who is honest and fun, and she's just playful and relaxed. I can't wait to get started!",1407456000,2,391,4.0256410256410255
