7751949,2,B01FWDFP4A,"I knew going in that this was a highlight film. I have watched these types of videos before. They help to retell the story in a 60-90 minute format, this particular program being 70 minutes.  Realizing that it is tough to squeeze an entire season or even a Playoff run into that amount of time, I didn't expect to see every play or entire games. However, I did expect to get the ""stories"" from the Regular Season and the drama from the Playoffs and Finals. Unfortunately this was not the case.
There was not a Single mention or any footage of former head Coach David Blatt. He coached the team to the Finals in 2014/15 and into late January of 2015/16, nearly half a season. There was little to no mention of the trades that were made this season to solidify the Cavs team. No mention of the Cleveland crowd singing the pregame National Anthem or the large crowds and sellouts of the ""Watch Party"". Arguably the biggest moment of Game 4, LeBron ""stepping over"" Draymond and the subsequent groin punch leading to Greens' Game 5 Suspension was completely missed. No footage, no mention of the Suspension. Curry fouling out and throwing his mouthpiece in frustration During Game 6 in CLE was also completely missed. Two of the more controversial moments of the Finals ignored. Unacceptable. There is minimal coverage of the Game 7 celebration in CLE & even less parade footage. One last gripe is very little audio footage of Austin Carr and Fred McCloud, personal favorites.
To a Cavs fan, the DVD is worth seeing. But if you don't know the stories from the season, don't expect to hear and see them here.",1470960000,8,1602,4.621052631578947

7751951,5,B01FWDFP4A,"I'm sorry that a lot of people got the idea that this is a collection of games from the playoffs, but it's not. That would be a really cool thing to put out too.

This is a really nice documentary that ever-so-briefly (mercifully!) touches on Cleveland's sports championship drought, but then really picks up with LeBron's draft and first stint in Cleveland, his departure to Miami, the rebuilding Cleveland did in those years, and his return. I think just about every played on the 15-16 squad is interviewed. The video quality is great except some of the older footage is understandably grainer than this year's games.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to any Cavs fan wanting a condensed way to relive the fun of the past season, up through and including the victory parade. It's fun and well done!",1470873600,8,806,4.75

7751963,5,B01FWDFP4A,Fun DVD. It had cool player interviews (I really liked the one about The Block). Nice summary of the season and the bonus features with top plays are cool too.

7751979,5,B01FWDFP4A,"As a lifelong Cleveland Cavaliers' fan, I loved this DVD! It gives a synopsis of the Cavs championship season from beginning to end, touching on the regular season and all rounds of the 2016 playoffs.  It has a wonderful collection of season highlights and interviews with the players.  The only thing that would make this better is if they had included a little more coverage of the celebration in Cleveland with the parade, etc.",1475539200,,430,4.797297297297297

7751991,4,B01FWDFP4A,Format was above average. It felt a little bit rushed when telling the story. Very few complaints. I did not like how they went from the Kevin Love defense late in the 4th quarter- straight to the celebration. They completely cut out any mention of the LeBron missed dunk (foul/ free throws) and the last GSW possession where they missed the final (2) three-point attempts before the buzzer.,1473206400,2,391,4.764705882352941
7751992,4,B01FWDFP4A,"Great behind the scenes footage of the 2016 playoffs. I would give it 5 stars if it had the entire game 7 footage, but it just has a condensed, behind the scenes snap shot.",1473120000,,172,4.088235294117647

7751998,3,B01FWDFP4A,I thought this was a full recording of Game 7 between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors. It's not.,1472601600,11,114,4.75

7752000,1,B01FWDFP4A,"I pre-ordered this item thinking it was the full 2016 NBA Finals, and at that time there were no reviews. However, when I received it and and before opening it, I decided to see if there were any reviews. I'm glad I did because it was stated this is a documentary, and not the true 2016 NBA Finals. The title ""The Finals........."" is misleading. It should have stated in the description that this was a documentary, and not the true NBA Finals. I quickly return it for a refund.",1472342400,25,478,4.382022471910112

7752004,5,B01FWDFP4A,"This is not only a way for all NBA fans to remember one of the league's greatest comebacks, greatest accomplishments, & greatest Finals series of all time....but it is also a great way for Cavaliers fans to relive a historic moment for the City of Cleveland & best sports moments in many of their lives!",1471392000,,303,4.527272727272727
7752005,5,B01FWDFP4A,It was a very well done video. I suppose that they could have did more history of the franchise.,1471305600,,96,4.105263157894737

7752008,5,B01FWDFP4A,"People complaining about this not being replays of the games are imbeciles. I never, for a second, thought that's what this was supposed to be. This documentary summarizes the Cavs championship from the very beginning, to the end. Beginning with Lebron being drafted in 2003, to him leaving and the Cavs rebuilding via Kyrie and Tristan. This video is packed with never before seen footage and that's exactly what I wanted to see. Not replays of the games I already saw. Not all the highlights we've seen in every other Cavs season recap. If you want to see new content, including interviews with nearly every person on the team, this is a great buy.",1471046400,,650,4.7105263157894735
8761628,5,B01FWDFP4A,Great summary of the excruciatingly difficult battle of the Cavaliers during 2015-16 to capture Cleveland's first major sports championship in 52 years and the first ever championship for the Cavaliers franchise.,1528675200,,212,5.870967741935484
8761629,5,B01FWDFP4A,Another great video chronicling great NBA action! This time around it's the underdog Cleveland Cavaliers going to Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals to claim victory on the home floor of the highly favored Golden State Warriors. This is a must-have for any Cavs fan (or NBA fan for that matter).,1522454400,,290,4.596153846153846

8761631,2,B01FWDFP4A,"It's frustrating that NBA Films has reduced these year end videos to season highlight films with few extra features.  They used to have whole fourth quarters and vignettes of the star players.  The highlights are ok and the video does a good job of capturing the season, but the lack of special features over the last couple years is incredibly disappointing.",1501545600,,359,4.868852459016393

8761636,1,B01FWDFP4A,"THIS IS A DOCUMENTARY, NOT THE ACTUAL SERIES. I mistakenly bought this thinking it was the full finals series. You can buy each game of the 2016 NBA finals on iTunes for $3 a game (no commercials!).

Don't let this crap DVD distract you from the fact that the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
