7872475,4,6304475667,"Hercules, as everybody knows, is the son of the chief god Zeus, who is rather promiscuous. Zeus' wife has forgiven Zeus' infidelity and is constantly seeking ways to harm his bastard son Hercules. Many versions of this ancient myth describe Hercules as a nave, immature, not too bright, over-grown, but very strong boy. This series shows the hero as strong and usually, but not always, smart. The film depicts Zeus acting as a somewhat silly oversexed human, and is filled with portrayals of near naked women.

 Hera stops all fires on earth. She wants to freeze and kill all humanity. Hercules and a local beauty go to the Titan Prometheus for help, for it was Prometheus who first brought fire to mankind. Prometheus tells our hero that he must find the torch of fire that Hera snatched from him. While humanity tries to solve the freeze problem with sacrifices to the gods, Hercules sets off on an adventure to retrieve the torch, which is in the middle of a circle of fire.",1295913600,2,977,4.674418604651163
