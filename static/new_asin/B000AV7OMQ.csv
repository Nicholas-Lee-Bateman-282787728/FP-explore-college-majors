I don't think they did a very good job translating the film into English.  I would have liked to have been able to choose subtitles in Spanish.  Maybe I would have understood it better.  Russian film makers should be told to have more than one language available for DVD releases in the United States.  Otherwise, the film is charming.  If I had understood more of what was being said, I probably would have given it four stars.",1301097600,,602,4.36936936936937
8211466,4,B000AV7OMQ,"""I waited---Every person has to know how to wait for their moment.""  So says one of a pair of Russian sisters in this film, as she explains how she longed for a special someone beyond her reach for many years; someone who she eventually gets her chance with.  That's sort of the plot of this film, as Russians bide their time dreaming of a brighter future, ""Dreaming of Space.""  The film, of course, takes place during the US-USSR space race, otherwise the above would have no resonance.  The film opens with guys boxing; one very adept, and another still learning.  the latter befriends the former & soon begins following him everywhere, seemingly to learn what he can from the more accomplished fighter.  Later we find out, however, that the unskilled one has an ulterior motive and is actually on a mission to watch the other man.  We see an official man, often on his motorized bicycle, giving instructions to the unskilled boxer, as well as taking in the details that the latter learns about our mysterious man.  The mysterious man's motto could be summed up with this exchange we hear in the film: ""I temper myself.""  ""Like steel,"" another asks.  ""In case your country calls?""  ""Exactly.""  I must say, though that it's hard to tell whether our mysterious man is really up to anything for anyone, but himself; notwithstanding others' suspicions.  In a way, the film sort of advances the view that people don't have to be necessarily on some sort of mission even when they seemingly appear to be; that hope for the future so emboldens people to look ahead too.  That's what the folks in this film do & the space issue is a bit of a conduit to make this clearer; even though actual space motifs/visuals are only in evidence in a few scenes within this film---which ends, interestingly, with a parade for Yuri Gagarin in Moscow (actual footage is used for this too).  I purchased this film myself & shall watch it again.  That says something; just that, but then again Russian films I find to be quite interesting usually.  Perhaps if you feel similarly you just might like this film, but it's up to you to decide that. Cheers!",1136851200,,2129,4.649732620320855
