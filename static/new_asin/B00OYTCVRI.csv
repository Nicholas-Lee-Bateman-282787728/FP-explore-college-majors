6777013,5,B00OYTCVRI,"I've been waiting nearly 20 years for this day!!!!
One of the most precious CD sets in my collection is the Cities of the Heart two disc set that came from this show. That set came in a slip case with a beautiful booklet full of glossy images from this magical concert. The show looked great in still images and the music was extraordinarily awesome... with Mr Bruce assembling an all star support band and covering his life's work. Of particular note was the set with Gary Moore and Ginger Baker covering some CREAM classics!  Listening to that CD set Bruce more than once referred to ""Cameras"".... so I was hoping for the opportunity to view this show.... but nothing.  When the internet came into prominence I began looking for this show and the rare poor quality bootleg would be whispered about..... but nothing.  Upon the passing of the great Jack Bruce ..... came the shocking announcement of this set!!

When I first put the discs in and looked at the booklet I was very confused... well turns out this is a two night show and the cast was a bit fluid, in fact the CREAM songs with Gary Moore and Ginger Baker are ALSO on this set with Clem Clempson on guitar instead of Gary Moore.... which is kinda cool, I like Clempson's work but to me it pails in direct comparison with the late great Gary Moore.  The Gary Moore set is tacked onto the back of the entire show and is about 50 minutes in duration on DVD 2.

On this set there is a third DVD with a documentary on Jack Bruce that is a bit over an hour long and features subtitles which can not be removed (this is likely a German broadcast)....the bonus CD fills in with duplicate tracks NOT on the original 2 CD set. often finding Clempson instead of Moore on guitar etc..

Another reason I was hopeful of this release was the still images in the booklet I've had for 20 years... indicated a posh set design and a real expensive looking show and the DVD does not disappoint ... it looks phenomenal!!  For fans of Gary Moore and of course Jack Bruce... this is ESSENTIAL and head, shoulders, knees and ankles above Mr Bruce's other solo DVDs on the market.  I do recommend his collaboration with Robin Trower on DVD if you want more besides his seminal work with CREAM.",1417737600,28,2230,4.419512195121952
6777014,5,B00OYTCVRI,"To release this splendid concert shortly after the death of Jack Bruce is definitely a fitting tribute to the genius of the man. Showing not only the legendary bassplayer, but also the singer, composer, keyboardplayer.

With this concert you really get an almost complete overview of the highlights of his career up til then, although any Lifetime or ""Escalator Over The Hill"" material is missing. There is blues dating back to his days with Graham Bond. Tracks from his glorious solo album trilogy from the 70s: ""Songs For A Tailor"", ""Harmony Row"", ""Out Of The Storm"". Some avantgardish jazz numbers with only him, Dick Hecstall-Smith and Ginger Baker (perhaps not the tracks people will hear the most). And a powerful Cream tribute with Gary Moore - which also marks the start of BBM. This their first show might have been their best ever performance, such a tangible feeling of joy amongst the three, even Ginger looking so happy.

Lots of distinguished guests. Besides the already mentioned there are people like Bernie Worrell, Pete Brown, his longtime lyricist here singing ""Politician"", Clem Clempson, Simon Phillips. Gary Husband who not only plays some excellent fusion drums on Jack's moving Charlie Parker tribute ""Bird Alone"" but also excels on keys. And Maggie Reilly dueting with Jack on the gorgous ballad ""Ships In The nIght"", a song that should and could have been a major hit.

A show with so many musicians and rotating line-ups could have been a mess, but at this event everything functioned smoothly, all held together by the powerful musicial vison(s) of the man at the center: Jack Bruce.

All is very well packed and includes a rather 'deep' documentary video which paints an intriguing portrait of Jack as artist and person. Plus some beautiful booklets. With both audio and visuals in usual fine Rockpalast quality. So even if you should have the previous CD-release from these concerts ""Cities Of The Heart"" this a must have. Not only for longtime Jack Bruce fans, but for all lovers of creative and progressive music. And should the death of Jack have made you curious about what the man was up to after Cream, well this is the perfect place to start.",1417651200,14,2179,4.897018970189702

6777044,5,B00OYTCVRI,real deal. it was released in 1993 with half songs available now as 2 CD from CMP (2cd set cities of the heart). I got in in December 1993 just after Somethin else cd was released. I was so shocked by the high quality of all included there that amazed me forever. Then I wondered why Colosseum live 1994 from Koln was released as cds and dvds and the very concert not. Hard to understand. DVD was bootleged with some songs missing and now we have a real treat. I had also vhs copy of the documentary that I consider great. Ginger would ask only 1 question WHY? the song TUBE was not included on bonus cd WHY? It is a song recorded in 1963 or about for the first time by Jack Ginger and Dick. WHY? Remember some songs available also on mentioned 2cd CMP deserted cities... and collection from CPM,1418083200,3,795,4.2368421052631575
8685472,4,B00OYTCVRI,"In May of 1993 Jack turned 50 and he did it in style. I bought the beautiful jewel box double-CD at Tower Records in LA and the insert material was filled with photos, track information and it was pricey at the time. Of course we all heard Jack yell after his solo in First Time I Met The Blues, What camera do you want me to sing into-that one???!!! so we knew there was video of the show. We would have loved even a VHS video in 1993. That is frustrating that the suits couldn't get it together until 2014.
Search out the DVD from Germany. Jack plays cello at the head and Gary Moore breathes the most fire into the tracks which is what you would expect. Ginger plays well which after Simon Phillips strange drum solo is volcanic but steady- for Ginger Baker. Pete Brown gets into Politician but not the high notes- which shows in contrast the operatic talent of Jacks singing style who composing it in C# and later in D for the live versions. We could have really enjoyed the video in 1993 but were happy to own the CD as Jack the Lad rolled into his 50s. Thirteen years later Cream would reunite with Claptons stubborn hesitation after Jacks illness and transplant. RIP Gary Moore, Jack Bruce, it was only a question of time.",1528588800,,1229,4.3478260869565215
8685473,5,B00OYTCVRI,"Awesome stuff on this DVD, Jack showcases his entire musical talents with solos and super charged back up artist. If you enjoy watching musicians perform live, this is for you, especially if you like Jack. There is more here than Jack. Gary Moore's guitar work is spot on, some times exceeding the originals.
