4227825,3,B003Y7F1PU,"It was nice, but a little discouraging that I bought it and paid almost the same price to ship it - When they were having an SNL Christmas special in Comcast on demand. Oh well.",1389052800,,177,4.085714285714285
4227826,5,B003Y7F1PU,"Hey babe, you got the myrrh?
The what?
The myrrh.
The what?
The myrrh.

Haha...great set up clips to watch during the holiday season.",1366588800,,133,4.541666666666667
4227827,5,B003Y7F1PU,Bought this gift as a Christmas gift. The quality is great and the person who received it was satisfied with it too. Great buy.,1362528000,,127,4.333333333333333
4227828,4,B003Y7F1PU,If you were to buy this you won't be disappointed however (to me) Gilly was always Kristen Wiig weakest character.  The DVD however has a great bonus section that is worth watching.,1361750400,,181,4.65625
4227829,5,B003Y7F1PU,"There are some great newer skits included in this disc vs. the original SNL Xmas DVD.  Skits like Schwetty Balls, Alec Baldwin as a Glengarry Glen Ross-like raging Elf Supervisor, ???? in a Box by Samberg and Timberlake, and the crazy holiday song sung by Chris Kattan, Horatio Sans, Tracy Morgan and Jimmy Fallon nervously twitching and not knowing what to do with the electronic keyboard instrument make this disc well worth the asking price.",1359849600,,444,4.92
4227830,4,B003Y7F1PU,"This is my number one pick for SNL holiday skits. The Church Lady's Rockin' Drum Solo, Sveddy Balls, D*ck in a Box, and the Santa Liners, because you never know who has been sitting on Santa's lap before you. I'd give it fives tars but Kristen Wiig's annoying title character pops up just a little too often for my tastes. Put this video in on Christmas Eve along with Scrooged, and you will have a very merry Christmas.

Get this disc instead of ""SNL Christmas"" as it has many more skits, and is just a few pennies more.",1359849600,,521,4.316326530612245
4227831,5,B003Y7F1PU,"This is a compilation of skits and they're pretty funny.  All good, well worth watching for a good laugh anytime.",1358467200,,113,4.65
4227832,1,B003Y7F1PU,"I bought this almost a year ago. Every year on Christmas Eve, after we have a seafood feast (an Italian tradition), we watch the SNL Christmas Past DVD. It's hilarious, but we were getting a bit sick of watching the same DVD year after year. I purchased this last year to watch instead, but the DVD didn't work. I never did get around to trying to return it, etc. It was a bummer. We watched the old DVD instead, but I really wish this one would have worked.",1352764800,,458,4.215909090909091
4227833,5,B003Y7F1PU,Love this video. You can never go wrong with SNL. Fast shipment from Amazon. Quality product and great price. Would buy from Amazon again.,1327449600,,138,4.791666666666667
4227834,4,B003Y7F1PU,"Back in the day I used to tape alot of Saturday Night Live. Between the live stuff on NBC and the reruns on cable I came up with quite the collection, none of which I have any longer, sadly.

The Christmas show was always cool because you got to see a lot of classic stuff. But sometime in the past ten years they started to re-tool the X-mas special, first with Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon as MC's and then, last season, with Gilly. That character that you always want to punch in the face. In some ways I see this as a waste of time, even though I can understand them trying to appeal to a younger crowd with newer bits...

That being said, a bulk of this collection goes about as far back as the Will Ferrel years. Remember then? Way back in the 1900's? Anything before those years are represented by ""clips""...  so some classic sketches only get a couple seconds. A shame when you only get three seconds worth of Dysfunctional Family Christmas! There is an older collection that includes more sketches that DONT include Will Forte (that guys a nub.)

However what this collection has that the other doesn't (besides bring it on back to ""Homeless-ville"" and Dick in a Box) is the full cut of the 1975 cast performing Winter Wonderland,,, a real holiday treat! With the Band of Nurses ripping it up and a hot sax line inspired, I think, from the Ventures version. It's very cool. Plus the lost ending of It's a Wonderful life is always amazing!

You can either go with this version of the Christmas special or the older one from 1999 on DVD. Neither is perfect SO... basically if you want more post 2000 stuff look here, more pre-2000 stuff, go there.

*Neither version has Gumby's Christmas Special or The Sweeney Sisters, just as a heads up :(",1293062400,30,1745,4.4375
4227851,1,B003Y7F1PU,seriously so so incredibly boring. HATED it and I am an SNL fan,1449100800,,63,3.923076923076923
4227852,2,B003Y7F1PU,It was ok. Not the special we were looking for.,1422835200,,47,3.8
4227853,1,B003Y7F1PU,Why did the choose such an obnoxious character to host a Christmas collection?  And a lot of the skits were put out in the first DVD Saturday Night Christmas Collection.  The had to have more material they could have used.  Get the first collection they put out.  This one sucked.,1419206400,7,280,4.54
4227854,5,B003Y7F1PU,"An attractive price for a Christmas compilation of classic Christmas
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skits... from Christmasses, past.",1415145600,,122,6.235294117647059
4227855,2,B003Y7F1PU,The Gilly character is creepy. Skits just OK. There are better SNL videos. This ended up at the Goodwill,1406678400,,104,4.526315789473684
4227856,4,B003Y7F1PU,"It is a fun DVD with bunch of sketches collections in SNL, but there are some repeats with other the Best of SNL DVDs.",1404604800,,118,3.9583333333333335
4227857,5,B003Y7F1PU,This is a fun blast from the past for any SNL lover. If you loved Gilda Radner this is a must have.,1402617600,,99,3.5454545454545454
4227858,5,B003Y7F1PU,"I enjoyed the DVD of Kristen Wig from the beginning to the end.  Even though, I had seen the skits on TV, I still really thought it was fun to add to my other SNL DVD.",1402358400,,167,3.638888888888889
4227859,5,B003Y7F1PU,"It arrived promptly. Great job. Very reliable thanks so much. We didn't think it would arrive for my daughter's gift exchange, but we were happily surprised.",1389744000,,157,5.076923076923077

8408838,3,B003Y7F1PU,"Gilly is such a cute character!!!  Love Kristen Wiig, and her awesome funniness.  Too bad most of the other SNL sketches included in this Christmas dvd are so ill-timed and off-color humor.",1518825600,,189,4.875
8408839,2,B003Y7F1PU,"The only thing that got this 2 stars is the skits that are repeated from the original DVD-Steve Martins Christmas Wish, Marthas Topless Christmas, Shweddy Balls, long lost ending of IAWL and a couple more. VERY disappointing that d*ick in a box is censored... really?!?  On a DVD I buy vs TV I wouldnt have expected that. Off to Goodwill it goes.",1514160000,,346,4.580645161290323
8408840,4,B003Y7F1PU,this Christmas special is not the same one that is aired on tv. It doesn't have every single skit that may be on the one you saw on air. still is a nice compilation.,1501804800,,165,3.8823529411764706

8408842,5,B003Y7F1PU,All I have to say is LOVE. I could watch this every night its hilarious. It was a gift to me from my mom (bought on my own account?) but reguardless I love it and am so happy she purchased it for me!,1455580800,,199,3.6511627906976742

8408844,5,B003Y7F1PU,Great dvd.,1452643200,,10,4.5
8408845,4,B003Y7F1PU,"As a character, Gilly stinks. I never understood why it became as popular as it did. So to me, the character lead-ins to each sketch are the weakest element of this presentation. But otherwise this is the most comprehensive and entertaining of the ""SNL"" Christmas compilations and definitely worth repeat viewing.",1450310400,2,313,5.1568627450980395
