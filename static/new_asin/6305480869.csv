1035998,5,6305480869,"Payback is an excellent peice of work.  The acting and writing both exceeded my expectations.  A simple plot. Mel Gibson does not save the world.  Just a man who wants his money back.  Action packed, and very  comical at times.  Definately a ""must see"".",933120000,,253,4.636363636363637
1035999,5,6305480869,This movie has everything.  Kristofferson is a great bad guy because he is so funny and you wouldn't think of him playing that role.  This is some of the best acting from Mel Gibson that I've seen since the Lethal Weapon  movies.  The woman from the Ally show was fantastic!!!  A must have.  I  would definately buy this movie now while it is so cheap.  It's so good to  see Mel Gibson in such a dark and mean role.,930873600,,415,4.151898734177215

This ""Director's Cut"" is how the Director wanted the movie to turn out and after some internal viewings it did not do well and the Film company and Producers decided it needed to end differently but the Director did not want to change it so the director left the film. That is this version, it plays completely different and has a completely different ending and in my opinion was not good and I can see why they wanted it shot differently. I would get the original Theatrical version of Payback.",1516147200,2,584,4.571428571428571

Second - I am so disappointed with the directors cut and the ending it provided, I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil it.

This one has all the best parts of it chopped out and replaced with different ones. Theres is no Fairbanks in this version. Instead they replaced it with a woman that just doesnt fit. I thought with a Directors Cut you would get more! Obviously I was wrong. Do yourself a favor a buy the original. Not sure what the Directors were thinking when they made this version.

1036417,1,6305480869,"Warning: This is the Director's Cut, and it is awful.

Ive never seen a more badly butchered edit of a good film.  The theatrical release includes a really tight montage during the opening credits that is an impressive example of characterization.  Gone in the directors cut.  The start of the film was all turned around, apparently to avoid the flashback later, and it lost a lot of coherence.  Kris Kristoffersons character is cut out completely, along with the torture scene and the nice, tidy wrapping up of the conflict.  He is replaced by some woman who we never actually see.  The fat boy scene is gone.  The last quarter of the film is a purposeless foot chase where Mel Gibson shoots a couple dozen anonymous bad guys, all footage that never made it to the theatrical release.  The climax is evidently that he ran out of anonymous bad guys to shoot, and hes not completely dead.",1498348800,4,887,4.634615384615385

It is character driven which is a nice change of pace from our current paradigm for films of its type. It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination and while I think it is supposed to be set in the early 70's based on the set pieces, clothes, talk ect...there are a few misses such as Maria Bello's performance which is kind of all over the place, the Outfit ""Capos"" Fairfax and Carter don't seem to be well cast (which is to say nothing of the actors, both of whom are great) and its sometimes heavy handed approach but all in all its definitely fun .

The only thing that remained of that character, who was male in the original, is a few sentences spoken over the phone by a woman. That might have been an interesting twist, if the character actually appeared in the movie. She does not. Bottom line, the movie lost most of it's impact for me.

This new version has been stripped of much of what made the original great - a great antagonist, a real sense of danger, comedy, music and tone.  I was surprised about how much different footage had been shot for the two versions, but unfortunately, in almost all cases, the original is better.

This cur was a disappointment.  The extra scenes added little to the story and did nothing to return to toward the story line in the book.  But, the rest didn't make it any better either.  I actually liked the bleached print look of the original Mel Gibson version.  Buy that one!",1474243200,,545,4.294117647058823
1037493,5,6305480869,"Before the wheels fell off Mel Gibson, he starred in PAYBACK in 1999. PAYBACK happens to be one of my favorite movies with Gibson, ranking a whiff below the Lethal Weapons and the Mad Maxes. PAYBACK is nasty and mean and down and dirty. The movie's tagline is ""Get ready to root for the bad guy,"" and, yeah, Porter (no first name) as played by Gibson is a first class heel, the kind of lowlife who'd steal from a blind beggar. See, Porter used to pull these daring payroll jobs, masterminded 'em, executed 'em. He also used to drive and provide protection for a high class soiled dove named Rosie (Maria Bello), but that ended when he got too close to her. Porter was married. He sometimes partnered up in his heists with his sadistic pal Val Resnick (Gregg Henry).

But, see, Val desperately required $130,000 to get back into the good graces of the crime syndicate what calls itself the Outfit. Except Val and Porter's last heist produced only $140,000, leaving $70,000 for the two crooks to divvy up. No honor among thieves? That for sure applied to Resnick. Cue the betrayal, Porter's getting fatally shot up in the back, courtesy of Porter's traitorous wife (Deborah Kara Unger), an unforgivable act of duplicity no doubt proposed by Resnick. Off they drove, thinking Porter had croaked.

Months pass on, and suddenly a mysterious figure begins to shake down the underworld. And when I say ""mysterious figure,"" I say it with tongue in cheek. Because Porter doesn't at all try to hide his identity. Goes the other way, in fact. Porter shouts to the world that he's back and he wants his seventy grand. Searching for Val, he relentlessly works his way up the Outfit's chain of command. One of the best running gags in the movie is that the wise guys he runs into (and inflicts pain on) keep talking up the $130,000, only for Porter to correct them - just the $70,000, thank you, and not one penny more.

PAYBACK doesn't much care that it lacks three-dimensional characters. Porter himself is a one-note character in a one-note film. And yet this is one of those rare instances when it doesn't matter. PAYBACK oozes with attitude and style. It presents a twisted noirish flavor backed by a jazzy cool score. The supporting cast is impressive, composed of luminaries like Kris Kristofferson, William Devane, David Paymer, Lucy Liu, and James Coburn, all of them playing baddies, all of them clearly having fun with their roles, especially Coburn as a sort of folksy Outfit lieutenant and Liu as Gregg Henry's super-dedicated dominatrix girlfriend. I wouldn't be surprised if her performance here drove her star up in Hollywood.

The violence is not of the patty cake persuasion. This movie is brutal. Mel Gibson is at his most intense. I love it that Porter is unapologetically an a--hole, a merciless anti-hero with a hard-on for vengeance and yet saddled with a personal and very specific code of ethics. But this guy kills with no compuction. We roll with him because it's Mel Gibson - before his public image went down the crapper - and because the guys he's bracing are clearly more heinous than he is and because his voice-over narration produces very funny dialogue. PAYBACK is very quotable, including Porter's superb closing line as the end credits roll. And Porter is reluctantly a sweetheart, which is why Maria Bello is in the movie, to demonstrate that he has a vulnerable side. And Bello is marvelous yet again. She humanizes him. Somewhere in PAYBACK the tone takes a series of gritty romantic sojourns, long enough for a wistful Rosie to murmur sweet nothings to her former driver, like: ""You know what I think? I think that, uh, all those stories about you being dead were true. You're just too thick-headed to admit it."" See? Makes your heart melt. But, hey, if you're not into the mushy stuff, no worries. Doesn't take long for Porter to get back to brutalizing or outwitting various denizens of the underworld, whether they be crooks or dirty cops or blind beggars.

And my favorite Porter line?

- Rosie (gazing at a beat up Porter): ""Omigod, what happened to you?""
- Porter: ""I got hammered.""

You have to see the movie to get the punchline.",1474070400,,4164,4.735172413793103

Coburn and Kristofferson played their roles as earnestly as their almost-cameo weight deserved.  It wasn't hard to guess how Kris would go--and all the neighborhood's apartment buildings and their inhabitants were undisturbed by the explosion and fire!  And Mel NEVER limped after a couple of piggies were mashed!  At least as a cop in his trilogy he was a sympathetic figure as battled the bad guys.  This was more of a ""they all get what they deserve"" flick.  Still, good with popcorn.",1463875200,,630,4.580357142857143

Oh, yes, it is film noir. This is a very contemporary expression of the P.I. genre from the '40s. Rather than describe it, let's just say that Mel Gibson gets to be Mel Gibson all over again. I really enjoyed his expression of his character. He always gets beat up and shot, and he always recovers faster than the Energizer Bunny; but he plays each role as a different persona. I would give this one five stars, except that I felt the script had too many unexplained events or missing events.",1461715200,,657,4.264

It's not ""realistic"" so much as it is coherent and smartly presented. It's got a noir edge and an unhinged roil of redemption in it, but is darkly comic and acerbic too. The blend of action, plot, and aesthetics is well-balanced but has a lunatic spin to it. Mel Gibson is perfect for the role as a jerk at the end of his rope; in fact, the casting is pitch-perfect throughout. It will make you laugh and make you wince, and sometimes even cheer for a boneheaded crook who's trying to recover some scrap of relevancy and reward from a rough existence.",1461024000,,671,4.376

The original had a plot with some sense while the directors cut jumped to the action/shootem up garbage of todays action movies. The original had revenge, treachery, fair play, without all the sex. The directors cut jumped to a complete different crummy scenario ending the last 20 minutes of the movie. I had to go back to my tape and watch the last 20 minutes or so to enjoy the movie. The directors cut was just a bunch of senseless killings by Mel Gibson or Porter in the movie. The killings were supposed to be cleverly arranged by Porter. It was a stupid ruination of a good or even great action drama. I would have placed it with the best action movies then the directors cut was so destructive that it dropped to the level of current garbage.

1041064,5,6305480869,"The version of Payback that was released to cinemas in 1999 was NOT the director's original vision of the film. An ugly blueish color throughout, and a nasty torture scene, plus a bit more of the S&M fetish, were gratuitous, doiing nothing to advance the plot. The third act itself was hatily shot in ten days, and what audiences got was a vulgar, night unwatchable mess of what promised to be a gritty crime drama.

In what seems to be the new normal, the studio has gotten its head out of the sand, and suffered Brian Helgeland (who was fired from this, his directorial debut, two days after winning the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for L.A. Confidential) to restore the film to his original vision. Thank God that Mel Gibson supported Mr. Helgeland in this endeavour, as well as giving him the opportunity to direct the film in the first place (from a screenplay Helgeland himself had written, based on a novel which was the basis for Point Blank). The effort was absolutely worth it.

Gone is the ugly blueish colour, and the brief S&M extension, and the torture sequence, along with the atrocious third act. What we have here is a fresh, vibrant film that is a clear homage to the crime dramas of the 1970's. This version is ten to eleven minutes shorter than the theatrical cut, and in this case, it works well. (The excellent Director's Cut of the epic TROY restores thirty minutes of footage that the studio forced the director to cut for theatrical release, and runs 196 minutes, and it is infinitely superior to the theatrical version; same goes for the Director's Cuts of Superman II & Rocky V, in my opinion). Restored are scenes cut by the studio that greatly enhance the plot. The alternate ending is ambiguous, and rightly so. It is good to have the audience make up its mind about the ending of the picture every once in a while instead of having everything spoon fed to them.

This PAYBACK is a leaner, yet thicker, cut of meat.",1450310400,,1950,4.581661891117479

1041224,2,6305480869,I bought this in blue ray and was so disappointed.  The Directors Cut takes out the most important scenes of Mel Gibson's Character being tortured and how he manages to get out of it.  They took out a number of some of the best scenes towards the end.  The Directors Cut leaves so much out in the end.  But the DVD that is not the Directors Cut trust me you will be happier.  You will get a good 20 minutes more of scenes that explain a lot and are very entertaining. I don't know what the Director was thinking shortening the film like this.,1443312000,,542,4.173076923076923

It was a very dramatic scene and I bought the entire movie for that scene.  Very disgusted with this version.

It's lacking in a lot of ways compared to other version. He gets a ton more revenge on people on the theatrical cut as well.

It's a Mel Gibson, super-bad guy, smoking his way through the film killing people to get his (stolen) $70 grand back.  Here's a movie that you're supposed to be rooting for the baddest bad guy in the picture.  That being said, it's a Mel Gibson movie.  If you like shoot-em-ups with Mel, it's great.  Has some interesting twists, how to handle bad cops comes to mind, but in this one, everybody is bad.  The nicest one is Maria Bello (excellent choice), playing a top dollar hooker, and her dog, Porter.  Gregg Henry is great as a sadistic creep, and Bill Duke & Jack Conley as the crooked cops are perfectly paired.  Throw in (small) parts for William Devane, Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn and you end up with some mean entertainment.",1436400000,3,831,4.5608108108108105

Triumph of the Will) uniting the plot and action. Payback delivers on this motif for sure. Robber-guy who has been double-crossed by true sadist colleague takes down the Syndicate in a clever way filled with agonizing violence and let's see how much Mel can endure playing ""this little piggy"". What makes you think that the dysfunction in these characters will live ""Happily ever after""as the head of into the sunset? Lots of gratuitous  violence.

1045642,4,6305480869,"Brian Helgeland has penned some really nifty scripts. Yes. He's had some stinkers but his hits far outweigh his misses. In this outing, he not only writes the script but directs as well and a way decent tough guy, crime thriller come to the fore.

Here's the scoop. Porter (Mel Gibson) helps scumbag Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) pull off a heist on some Asian dudes. His net of the $140,000.00 haul is 70K. But Val takes it all as Porters wife puts two bullets in his back as they leave him for dead. Problem is, he doesn't die and will wade through tons of doo-doo to regain his share.

This is simply good tough guy fare. Porter is clever and brutal but he has a heart. He anticipates the moves of his opponents as one might in a chess game. Sometimes he makes the wrong move and pays big time, but the viewer is always rooting for him because there is no reason to go through this much crap for so little money. And what would a crime thriller be without a couple of corrupt detectives. In this outing we have Bill Duke and Jack Conely who, you know will get their comeuppance, you just want to see how. Then there's the little rat (David Paymer) who is only as tough as the company he keeps. Yup. You're licking your lips waiting to see how he gets his. John Glover, Kris Kristofferson, William Devane, Lucy (Alexis) Liu fill out the bad guy quotient. The lovely Maria Bello is on hand as the love interest. But this is all about the scheming and what cards Porter will play to get his dough back.

Helgeland does a decent job directing this Chicago set piece. He gives the city an interesting look and skips the postcard gloss. The characters are written well and the noose tightens and relaxes at fairly even intervals to avoid becoming too overwrought. It's shot well and has a decent music score.

If crime thrillers are your poison, this will keep you more than satisfied.",1430611200,,1878,4.41907514450867

Also the character of Poe is more violent, more serious, and a bit less likeable than the Theatrical version, in this one although you want to see if he gets away with the money, at least myself wasn't ""cheering"" for this ""bad"" guy, as i could have been in the Theatrical version.

This was your normal color film, but without the narration and lighting effects, it seemed that it just really missed something as a movie.  That plot was average, the ending not very good (there is a different ending), and you don't get the feel for the characters like you did in the other one.

the director's cut of Payback because it's not as dark and witty as the theatrical version of Payback"", plus it doesn't have Kris. In the theatrical version of ""Payback"" Kris Kristofferson gives one hell of a performance; he, as far as I'm concerned, should have played the lead character because he has more guts and glory as an actor than Mel Gibson does, no offence Mel!

The music (what little of it there is) is so lame and completely without connection to the characters or what was happening. Whatever the person who wrote it got paid it was WAY TOO MUCH.

The color treatment to the film in the real movie was wonderful. My thinking is that the second director wanted something of the 70's, as well as the analog phones (dialers, speakerphones with the flip up knobs), muscle cars and dress in some occasions.

I think the dealer/deliverer had tatoos and piercings just to show how it could happen today or any time.

1046687,5,6305480869,"okay so here's the deal:

payback is based off of a book called ""the hunter"" by richard stark (donald westlake). it's dark, gritty and awesome. the original idea for the film was a lot like the book. but the studio got squeamish and re wrote the whole thing, so we got the original ""payback"": a quirky dark comedy about crime.

payback straight up is what the movie was originally supposed to be and it's way closer to the book! so before you watch it know that. it's not very funny (although it still has it's funny moments to be sure!), it's not supposed to be cute and porter is more dark and not such a good guy in this version. again, that's how the source material is, it's a dark book!

i love both versions, but i may not have if i hadn't read the book.

so consider reading it before you decide this version of the film is terrible. i watched the original cut, then read the book, then watched this. so if you do that you get the best of all worlds: a fun dark comedy (payback), a dark gritty book (the hunter), and a lively film that is a fairly true adaptation to the book (straight up).

amazon has the terrible habit of considering different editions of a product the same thing, so all the reviews for the original payback (which, as i've said is a totally different film) are being lumped together with the reviews for payback: straight up! this is probably one reason people are freaking out and so disappointed. people who haven't seen either hear that payback original edition is a funny crime movie with some grit and read reviews for it on the straight up page and end up with that one. then they're shocked at how dark it is. and people who know they want payback original edition have the same problem. then there's probably people who heard how funny the original is and read reviews on it's page about how dark and serious straight up is so they don't buy it at all! silly amazon. wonderful site, but some of these mistakes are just ridiculous and probably cause loss of profit for amazon and affiliates.

finally i'll say: a ton of people are SOOOO appalled by the fact that porter smacks around his wife at the beginning. let's examine this: porters wife shoots him FOUR times in the back, takes all his money and runs off with his partner, leaving him for dead, choking in a pool of his own blood in a parking garage. he barely survives and makes it back home months later.

i'm very much against violence against women, heck i'm against violence period, i spend lots of my time reading buddhist scripture, meditating, and finding ways to get rid of bugs that invade my space without hurting them. but when i'm watching a movie about a sociopath thief/killer i don't imagine he's a wonderful husband. that being said, maybe we're lucky all he did was smack her a couple of times?

if he was a really nice, regular guy and he hit his wife for nothing but looking at him cross eyed then by all means be VERY appalled. the audacity of a film writer to make such a character! my word! but come on people, sociopath thief/killer, VERY p*ssed off (And justifiably so) smacks his wife around. why are people surprised or offended by this?

oddly enough, not a single reviewer thought it was wrong that she shot him four times with the intent to MURDER him. they just watch him gurgling in his blood and eat their pop corn, they take a sip of soda as mal kicks him as hard as he can in the gut even though he's already laying on the ground dying, but he smacks her months later in response to this and the popcorn falls on the floor as they stand up in outrage, the soda is spat out and it's just the worst thing ever. i don't get it. attempted murder with a gun causing severe internal injury with months of recovery is small potatoes but responding to that with one short outburst of violence that did no apparent damage beyond maybe minor superficial injury (like the emergency room people would just tell you to go home because you're fine) is over the line. okaaay...

and her reasoning for shooting him? he cheated on her! his reason for smacking her a few times? being shot four times, robbed, and left for dead... i'm at a loss.",1376179200,2,4155,4.405475880052151

 I've recently read an interview where  Mel said he would never be forgiven by Hollywood ever for the mistakes he's made in recent years.
 Hey Mel, who cares, you've got the money to move out of this crumbling politically correct country whenever you want, and if Hollywood don't want you here so be it.
Do yourself a favor and get the hell out of here and take all your American money with you.
  Theirs no room here for people like you and I with freedom of thought, and the right to believe in what you want to believe  here in this socialist society we now live in without everyone including those liberal freaks on The View bitching about anything they don't agree with, they think their opinion is the only one that's correct and everyone else's is racist.

1046889,3,6305480869,"The best part about this BluRay disc is the 30-minute or so segment on the Making of the Director's Cut; why it was done and what exactly it entailed.

For me, the reason I hunted this movie down in the first place was the grittiness of it and, plain and simple, the sledgehammer scene at the end and how Porter came out of it. That was what made the movie memorable to me. That was back in 1999 and it still resonates.

I was initially a bit angered when I watched this Director's Cut; I felt like returning it for a refund. What happened to Kris Kristofferson? Where did the woman's voice (Sally Kellerman) come from? But the Director's Cut segment put things in perspective. I respect what director Helgeland wanted to do; how he envisioned the film, and what he had hoped to convey. He is an artist. But the studio was correct for what it decided to do in terms of the Third Act in the Theatrical release. It's in the business of making money and there's no doubt the studio's Third Act gave the viewer a feeling that they got their money's worth. There was resolution, there was comeuppance, there was survival. The victorious ""hero"" is intrinsic to human storytelling as far back as stories have been told. And the overwhelming majority of viewers would agree.

All things considered, I now like the Director's Cut in many ways. I like the variations in tone and color; I like much of the new music scoring. A couple of the re-inserted scenes were definitely needed. And I am happy for Mr. Helgeland that he was given the opportunity to rework the movie into what he originally sought out to accomplish. But it doesn't top the Theatrical Release. Certainly, it can complement it as a kind of alternate or perhaps more ""literate"" version; better in some ways, not as good in others.

Brian H version is okay but losing the humor takes the joy out of porter`s desire of 70k. Plus the ending of the original was very clever vs the this version. Ending more moralistic SPOILER ie porter is almost killed.

In commentary, director states that porter would not have kidnapped the kid. but i honestly wouldnt have cared if porter did. It`s not like he killed the kid in the end ie just bait to get dad.

so if you can get original version or you have seen it, then don't get this one. but if you have not seen it & like anti-heroes, then it`s not a bad movie.",1353542400,3,762,4.352112676056338

I guess amazon is using the reviews for the dvd and instant watch and the dvd version is actually director cut instead of the original.

For fans who love real influential movies like this e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry-Collection-Dirty-Harry-Magnum-Force-The-Enforcer-Sudden-Impact-The-Dead-Pool/dp/B002Z7FWBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry Collection (Dirty Harry / Magnum Force / The Enforcer / Sudden Impact / The Dead Pool)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NEW-JACK-CITY-SPECIAL-EDITION/dp/B0009VBTFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NEW JACK CITY:SPECIAL EDITION</a>, The French Connection, Diva, Cool Hand Luke, Scarface,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boyz-N-The-Hood-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0000A7W14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boyz 'N The Hood (Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;have all these elements and mixtures collide together in this piece that they can relate from. A few things were added was a new score done by music editor turned composer Scott Stambler (whom did a terrific job creating a remarkable and burning score, and please check him out on ReverbNation which contains all or most of the score featured on this Director's Cut), a few scenes that never made it through from the theatrical version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Payback/dp/B003CO7UPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Payback</a>, and for people who like to know the real truth behind it all should watch the almost 29-minute featurette ""Same Story, Different Movie - Creating Payback: The Director's Cut"".

One thing interests me was the quality and in-depth opinion on how Payback became the movie what it was, but everybody has their own opinion or statement behind the theatrical and director's version also. So what's the difference it's still the same movie, but all have different elements.

Props to director Brian Helgeland, Mel Gibson (whom starred and co-produced in this film), the crew, among others who gave their all commenting on this great picture and how it all laid out, and why the fans became impressed with it.

For fans on the score that Stambler put down, should suggest listening to various composers from David Shire, Barry White, Henry Mancini, Jerry Fielding, Lalo Schifrin, Don Ellis (whom done some scoring for The French Connection), Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield (e.g. Superfly or Sparkle), Marvin Gaye (e.g. Trouble Man Score Soundtrack), Donny Hathaway (e.g. his first and only score for the film Come Back Charleston Blue), etc.

The timing, the pacing, though a bit slow at times, the sets, Kris Kristofferson, Mel's former partner and especially James Coburn in an outstanding cheerful bad guy role near the end of his life, all are just excellent parts of the movie plus the Chinese bad guys.  My favorite is how Mel is stone tough.  The scene of torment near the end of the movie is cut in half on TV while the dvd of course has it all and it makes a big difference I think.  Mel's done a lot of movies but this one just rings right, a bad guy who isn't just all bad and has a love interest that actually makes some sense.  ""Then what good are you?"" one of the snappiest lines in a movie.  I use it in real life sometimes but it's in such a brutal context I try to make it clear I just like the flippancy of it in a severe setting.

I love 'Payback' and it is nice to have both versions on one disc, and no, I don't think two movies on one disc is causing any kind of (significant) quality loss.  Also, compared to the US version, this one has HD audio tracks, which is a nice upgrade.  As far as which version I like better, its hard for me to say, and that really is the point of this release.  It is not some gimmicky 'directors cut' with, like, 3 non-essential scenes plugged back in; you get the theatrical version, which is the one most people know and from what I've read prefer, but you also get the original director's vision.  This film was directed by Brian Helgeland, who was essentially cut out of the final process so that Mel & the studio could make a more audience-friendly (read: mainstream) version for release.  Now, we get to see  what Helgeland wanted to do from the start, which involves color saturation changes (it really does make a difference,) pacing changes and the removal of entire plot pieces and sequences.  It really does make for a different experience, and you may not be ""rooting for the bad guy, as the tagline to the theatrical version suggests.  It is also interesting to watch the interviews with Gibson and Helgeland talk about the original production and how they got back together to put out the director's cut of the film, and why they didn't just use this version from the start.

This is a foreign disc (U.K.), but like Warner's other foreign titles, it is region free and plays fine on US players.

1047115,5,6305480869,"This is a wonderful combination:  the theatrical release and the director's cut, all in super clear blu-ray.

The story is about Porter, an extremely tough guy who comes back from a presumed death to seek revenge.  Because he was ripped off $70K from a heist - shot for his share - he comes back demanding to get that back.  He starts off with absolutely nothing and claws his way back with a grim nonchalance.  Any resistance he meets results in cold murder.  The perpetrators are first, but when he fails to get satisfaction from them, he goes to who got the payoff.  Along the way, he contends with a wonderful roster of quirky characters, from a hooker he used to love to a S&M call girl (Lucy Liu in a classic cameo), dirty cops, and dripping, petty criminals.  It is as hilarious as it is horrifying and completely entertaining.

I must confess that I preferred the theatrical version.  It is cleaner, less ambiguous at the end, and Gibson's narration is delivered with the chilling boredom of a sociopath.  However, with the ending of the Director's cut and no narration, it is a different, far more intelligent, film and ultimately a great pleasure as well.  The director's cut expects more from the viewer, who must figure out what is going on.  I will say no more so as not to play the spoiler.

Now that I have watched this several times, it does feel a bit stylized, but the superlative acting more than makes up for it.  It is filmed with the emotional tone of film noire, but in color - quite a feat.  The director's cut is brighter.  Very interesting to contrast them.  There are also good extras included on how both versions were made.  This is destined to be a cult classic.

  ****************************

This is sort of an off-beat movie for Mel where he plays a tough guy who worked for the mob (the Outfit) along with high cost prostitute and later, girlfriend Rosie (Maria Bello).

 You'll notice when viewing the movie that there are no ""good guys"". Everyone is either in the Mob, part of the mob apparatus or corupt (like the two detectives who hound Porter). This lends the movie a different flavor than Mel's other productions ... but not necessarily in a bad way. As a matter of fact, Mel does an outstanding job in acting and the film is very entertaining (although the Outfit is pretty small in numbers for as much power as it's supposed to have).

 The entire screen play revolves around $70,000 dollars that represents Porter's (Mel Gibson) share of a heist from a gang of orientals who run an unspecified racket. Porter plans on stealing the weekly take of the oriental gang with a former member of the Outfit and sadist, Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). While the robbery comes off without a hitch, Resnick has conspired with Porter's wife to kill him (Mrs Porter found a picture of her husband with prostitute Rosie) and to take all of the stolen loot. Porter is shot in the back several times by his wife who then leaves with Resnick. From here, the story begins ...

 Resnick, who had a falling out with the Outfit, needs $130,000 to get back in good with them. The heist from the oriental gang provides $140,000, thus Resnick takes his partner's split and pays off the Outfit. Porter manages to survive the shooting by his wife and then embarks on a quest, after recuperating from his wounds, to get his share of the stolen money back. In doing this, he meets up with a weaselly pusher, a wimpy drug distributor, two corrupt detectives, a host of hitmen and a couple of ranking personalities from the Outfit.

 He hunts down his former partner, Resnick only to find that Val no longer has the stolen money ... he has already given it to the Outfit. Porter roughs Val up a bit and serves him an ultimatum, get me my share of the money. Resnick agrees, but plans to trap Porter using the gang who was the victim of the original heist. Porter survives the meeting and runs down Resnick ... then proceeds to try and get the Outfit to give him the $70,000 that Resnick stole from him.

 You can guess the Outfit's response, and so Porter begins a campaign against the leadership to force them to give up the cash.

 The action of the film is very good and Gibson plays a very convincing button man (he was the driver for and protector of prostitute, Rosie). The mobsters are somewhat comic and it is not real convincing that Porter could get to them so easily, nor that so few personel would be in the organization; but that really doesn't detract from the film.

 The background music is dark as is the plot (everyone is a gangster or corrupt), but on the whole, the film is very enjoyable to watch, although not believable. This because the Outfit is not far reaching (it represents organized crime) and is easily defeated by killing three key men.

 Transfer to DVD is sharp and clear and the audio/soundtrack is clear and vibrant. All in all, a worthwhile DVD. I'd recommend this for folks from, say, eight and up. Not that there is much blood or nudity (actually, no nudity), but simply because the younger audience simply would not understand what's going on. The film also tends to have a bit more violence in it than I would recommend subjecting a younger person to.

Heartily Recommended.

 Once again, be sure of the movie that you buy. I haven't seen the ""Director's Cut"" version myself, but there are enough reviews here mentioning it to convince me that it is a chopped up, poorer version of this film.

However, Porter manages to make it to a doctor, and get treated, when he recovers(despite having half of his face burned off), he sets out to get Murtaugh and his share $70,000. He begins by approaching an associate of Murtaugh's, a prostitute named Rosie, whom he knew what she was thinking. She tells him where he can find Murtaugh. When he does, he tells Murtaugh that he should go to his employers and ask them to give him back his son, Murtaugh says that's impossible but Porter ""convinces"" him to do it.

Edward the Longshanks orders one of his men to take Porter out but Porter's just too good for them. Murtaugh then asks his girlfriend who knows the people whom he and Porter stole the money from, and tells her to tell them where they can find him.

A hold up turns too small for one of the two gangsters who wants to get rid of the other and uses this other's girlfriend to do the bad work in his own back. But in this world there is always a comeback and then a payback and the payback is always proportional to the distance to catch up on the comeback journey, and when it is near death that was the starting point of this comeback you can be sure the payback will implicate a lot of money and a lot of metal. And it does and it is not that easy to go to the top of the drug dealing business, and that sure is not easy and there are many hurdles. We wonder why he got down in front of the last one, or is it a way to really trap the boss. But he is also a very creative hit man in his come back and he pays back a lot with the metal, explosive and guns of those he shot down or he wants to bring down. He is flexible, adaptable, opportunistic and his principle is not to hit higher than the top but to hit the top just to get his due and he gets it and he does not have to share in the end. That's what is good in this gangster film.

It turns out that the ""director's cut"" was the original version of the movie.  The original was dark, evil, and maliciously violent.  My biggest disappointment was that Porter(the protagonist) didn't die in it, I hated him so much.  The studio agreed, so much so they completely changed the tone of the film, creating a stupendous movie. The studio cut contained the ""missing scenes"" and revamped story line.  Yes, the studio had to reshoot the ending.  Yes, they had to add in characters.  Yes, they had to change dialogue and modify scenes.  But it was well worth it.

His Porter character is that same unstoppable hero / anti-hero that Gibson plays so effortlessly. The plot is fairly basic noir- Porter is double-crossed, shot, and left for dead. He refuses to expire, leading to his hunt for those who betrayed him THE END.- However, Gibson gives Porter a human quality that bleeds through his hardened, ruthless exterior. He is righteous in his quest, even when commiting cold-blooded murder. Of course, it helps that most of the badguys he's after are reprehensible in every way! Porter's universe is populated by thugs, junkies, whores, killers, corrupt cops, sadists, psychos, and a seemingly omnipotent crime syndicate... er, I mean outfit. Porter must slay his way through it's minions in order to receive satisfaction. He is absolutely driven and set on one goal. He is MAD MAX in a suit! PAYBACK is full of colorful dialogue and interesting, somewhat twisted characters. Maria Bello (THE DARK, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE) plays a high-priced call-girl and Porter's only friend, Lucy Liu (KILL BILL) is the hilariously wicked sado-masochistic dominatrix, and the outfit bosses are played by William Devane, James Coburn, and Kris Kristofferson (THE JACKET).

Yes, this version is dark, but the film is so original and clever that you keep watching it, keep enjoying it. It's a very intelligent piece of work.

Marvin's love interest is Angie Dickinson. In the 1967 version, Dickinson is not a call girl, but Walker's sister-in-law who runs a night club. She has unresolved ties with the syndicate that Walker is after. POINT BLANK is a noir film with the standard, austere production values of the late 1960s-early 1970s period. This makes the violence more realistic and brutal. Both films have very strong supporting casts. Marvin is better in the lead role and shows no hint of the humor that Gibson shows from time to time.

1047387,5,6305480869,"After nine years, we can now see this film as director Brian Helgeland originally intended. This version of the film is far more streamlined and features the original ending, along with a completely revised third act, new scenes, a new head villain, new score and is essentially a different film.
Based on the The Hunter, the first novel in Richard Stark's acclaimed ""Parker"" series; the story is about Parker (renamed Porter in the film)  and his single minded mission to retrieve his $70,000 share of the take from an armed robbery, where he was left for dead by his partner Val, aided by Porter's drug addled wife. To make matters worse, Val has turned Porter's share over to the Outfit, a national crime syndicate Val is trying to curry favor with after botching a job for them.
Mel Gibson is great as Porter. He plays it straight and seems to understand the streamlined, all business nature of the character. The film is peppered with great performances, with standout supporting roles from David Paymer, William Devane, James Coburn and Gregg Henry, who's role as Val Resnik should have made him a star.
My complaints about the film would be the relationship Porter has with Maria Bello's character. Porter as a driver for a prostitute just seems out of left field. He is an armed robber. Period. Why would he need to drive around a prostitute? for the extra pocket money? This also made him an Outfit employee, something his independent streak would never allow.
I also hate the fact that the main character's name is changed from that of his litratery counterpart. Trying to make this movie a standalone affair, rather than opening the door to seeing Parker in more movies based on Stark's other books shows a lack of ambition on the part of the film makers, but then again, this is more about Helgeland's cinematic vision rather than adapting a beloved novel.

The special features are just that; special. The director's commentary is insightful and entertaining and hints at why the main character's name was changes from Parker to Porter for the film; which was a big mystery to me. Mel Gibson sits for an interview and gives his side of the story as to why the Director's vision was scuttled in favor of a more audiance friendly version of the film. Even the mini documentary on the revised music score is insightful and entertaining, and highlights the 60's noir theme of the film which imporves on the original.

There is also a brief interview with Novelist Donald E. Westlake, who wrote the Parker novels of the 60's and 70's (as well as the 90's revival under the pen name Richard Stark - check them out!) . You may be interested to know that Parker was featured in 7 films altogether over the last five decades, played by Lee Marvin (Point Blank), Robert Duvall (The Outfit), Jim Brown (The Split) and even by a woman in European film entitled Made in the USA. Each film version never faithful to the novel it was based upon, and the main character never named Parker as the author would not allow it unless a serious effort to make a faithful movie was undertaken (or so I am told).

1047457,3,6305480869,"After having seen many ""Director's Cuts"" of fondly-remembered films, I'm starting to believe that the producers actually know what they're doing.  ""Payback"" is a good example.  Paid reviewers often deride viewers as cultural cretins if they don't embrace the ""director's vision,"" but that vision is often obviously flawed, and producers (and test audiences) see that.

  Paid reviewers have put down the theatrical cut of this film as ""vulgar.""  It's no more vulgar than the Director's Cut.  The chief difference between the two versions - and they differ far more than other films' ""D.C.s"" - is the emotional tone.  Whereas the theatrical cut puts a quirky comic edge on Porter's violent journey, the Director's Cut takes a sombre, self-important tack.

  The score is markedly different; whereas the theatrical version has many '70's pieces which firmly (and humorously) place it in its time, the Director's Cut has grimly moody meandering pieces that does much to establish its darker approach.  The brassy theme music from the theatrical cut is sorely missed, resulting in a duller experience.

  Paid critics often have predictable tastes: their reaction to voice-overs is one of them. The absence of Gibson's voice-over in the Director's Cut predictably makes the critics curtsy.  The film loses something in its absence though; Gibson's voice-over was well done, took nothing off his character's hard edge, and contributed some nice bits of humor.

  The director cut out many of the most interesting character bits in the film, thereby lessening its appeal.  His version culminates in a shoot-out which - while competently done - is actually more formulaic and less clever than the end of the theatrical cut.  After his changes, an edgy crime film comedy has become a forgettable crime drama.  No artistic ""higher purpose"" is served by that.",1241222400,4,1849,5.217687074829932

Mel Gibson is the ""good guy"" here, taking Marvin's role, but I put that in quotes because he's not really ""good,"" just a thief attempting to get his $70,000 back which was stolen from him by his partner and ex-wife in a former heist. He goes up the ladder, little guy to the top boss, to finally get his money.

Gibson gets beaten up several times and even gets tortured in one toes- crunching scene. The women are tough-looking, coarse and unappealing. I did like the metallic-blue hues in here, making this an interesting visual film. The city scenes are bleak, a la Tim Burton's ""Batman.""

I found the movie good enough to watch several times. Most people like a simple, revenge story which this really is, and there is dark humor in here, too. The other characters are interesting, particularly the one played by William Devane. I also liked the narration by Gibson, done in 1940s film noir style.

1047461,4,6305480869,"I liked the theatrical version, but I never understood just how much was wrong with it until seeing Payback - The Director's Cut. This version maintains the same tonality throughout the entire movie. Upon comparison, it becomes clear how much the voice over changed the tone of the film, and how it doesn't match the tonality of the performance. The narration and the added scenes in the theatrical version changes the nature of Porter (the main character) from a guy with more balls than brains to a guy who out thinks his opponents. The theatrical edition is a violent and inconsistent version of ""The Sting""; the Director's Cut instead shows us a man with a certain code of behavior and the will to enforce that code, but without the brains to realize how pointless and futile his behavior is. The theatrical release was a crowd-pleaser, a piece of disposable, cotton-candy entertainment, and it seemed Gibson was channeling his character from the Lethal Weapon series. Without the voice over, the subtleties of Gibson's performance are revealed, and it becomes clear this is no retread performance, but rather the revelation of an entirely different character and of Gibson as an actor. This Special Collector's Edition is a movie that makes you think about the characters and their stories, as well as metaphysical issues such as the nature of good and evil, etc. Little subtleties abound, such as how the USMC tattoo on Porter's arm is, in this edition of the movie, a key into understanding what motivates Porter and gives him is devotion to his mission, while in the theatrical release it was a throwaway detail, completely superfluous and unrevealing.

Long story short, if you watch the extras (as I did just to figure out what the heck happened to the movie) then you'll learn that this movie has changed hands many times over and apparently this is what the Director had originally intended.

Personally, I like the original version much more than whatever this mish mashed remix edition amounts to as it equated to a much fuller story. I know it was more over the top but the movie itself was over the top to begin with so why not at least be consistent in that regard instead of trying to get serious at the end. I won't ruin it for anyone..suffice to say that if you are looking for the Payback you saw in theaters, this is not it. It is something much different and I didn't enjoy it at all.

Side Note: It's apparent after viewing this film why the studio didn't like the direction this film was headed.  They were right to step in and rehash the content.  Where is the theatrical release?

I disagree with the director, I think in the end that ""Porter""is heading back accross the same bridge to the same hack doctor to save his life again.  This time he has the money, the girl and the car - I think that's why Gibson's character is smiling, he got away with it.

It was like a slightly darker version of Lethal Weapon with the same kind of light humor to make the violence not seem as harsh. I never hated the original, but I new that this film had director problems, so I knew I was not seeing the real version of the film. I had always been a huge fan of those old 70's revenge films like Death wish. When I saw this film back in 1999 it was good, but I wondered how it would have been handled on a more serious level. Seeing the new directors cut is like a breath of fresh air. Gone is the humor and replaced is balls to the wall seek them and kill them kind of  film. It is more adult and does not need to explain itself as much as the original. listen I love tongue and cheek action films, come on, I own almost every Schwarzenegger film, but sometimes people want serious.  Mel Gibson had is humor in the Lethal Weapon films which works great with those films. Payback was meant to be taken seriously. Remember Mad Max and the Road Warrior?

Had I never seen the theatrical version, I would say it is unequivocally one of the best anti-hero movies I have ever seen. There are some scenes that have been re-added that I feel are extremely important to properly developing porter. One of which unfortunately could not co-exist with the theatrical version's ""third act"" or I might suggest a combination recut. I think the director's cut truly showcases the vision that was behind the movie originally. The mood is dead on, and Gibson's performance draws a gut-shot reaction in a few places that is truly visceral. I do find myself still yearning for the voice-overs, mostly due to my own love affair with noir, and that blue filter. There was a playfulness to the original cut that I thought worked very well, however in light of the director's cut it's easy to see it was not what was intended. I think I'd be more inclined to rate this movie higher had they not axed some of the more classic noir elements I enjoyed  in the theatrical version. However, many people seem pleased with the removal of those elements, so there it is. All and all I would say that it is worthwhile to buy both copies of the movie.

First off the protagonist is named Parker not Porter in the book.

This movie is based on the book The Hunter AKA Point Blank the book where Donald Westlake writing as Richard Stark introduces us to Parker in 1962.  After re-reading the book after thitysomething years I realize that Lee Marvin,who was cast as Parker in an earlier movie, was probably cast as a truer version of Parker.  Danny DeVito would have been a good messenger and James Gandolfini, of Supranos fame, would have made a better Mal Resnick. The ending was changed for the movie, but what the hey, that's Hollywood.  I think I'll reread all of the Parker books as my next project if I can get hold of them.  They're that good.

I think Sam Elliott would make a great Parker.  He could make a whole career out of this series.

As far as I can tell the other Parker books are:

1) The Hunter (1962; AKA Point Blank, Payback; Parker, by Richard Stark).
2) The Man With the Getaway Face (1963; AKA The Steel Hit; Parker,
3) The Outfit (1963; Parker, by Richard Stark)
4) The Mourner (1963; Parker, by Richard Stark)
5) The Score (1964; AKA Killtown; Parker, by Richard Stark)
6) The Jugger (1965; Parker, by Richard Stark)
7) The Seventh (1966; AKA The Split; Parker, by Richard Stark)
8) The Handle (1966; AKA Run Lethal; Parker, by Richard Stark)
9) The Rare Coin Score (1967; Parker, by Richard Stark)
10) The Green Eagle Score (1967; Parker, by Richard Stark)
11) The Black Ice Score (1968; Parker, by Richard Stark)
12) The Sour Lemon Score (1969; Parker, by Richard Stark)
13) Slayground (1971; Parker, by Richard Stark)
14) Deadly Edge (1971; Parker, by Richard Stark)
15) Plunder Squad (1972; Parker, by Richard Stark)
16) Butcher's Moon (1974; Parker, by Richard Stark)
17) Comeback (1997;
18) Backflash (1998; Parker)..
19) Flashfire (2000; Parker, by Richard Stark)..
20) Firebreak (2001; Parker, by Richard Stark) ..
21) Nobody Runs Forever (2004) Parker, by Richard Stark

Highly recommended for Parker fans and fans of action adventure stories.

When I saw the original theatrical release of Payback, I thought it was a pretty good movie, 3 star quality, but it wasn't really anything new.  After I found out that the original movie had been altered without the directors involvement and I watched the director's cut the story gelled better and it became much more coherent and wonderful movie to watch.  This is definately a much better version (or should I say TRUE version) of the film that is definately worth watching.  It's not as comedic, but that fits the tone better and makes the violence seem more real rather than just poking fun at people's deaths.  I'm glad the director got to see his original vision represented and I hope he, and all directors, are allowed to make movies without The Suits interfereing from now on.",1194393600,5,904,4.762820512820513

Good paced, dark humor gangster movie. No redeeming qualities in any of the characters (except the Pitt Bull of course), beyond that Gibson's character is the closest you get to an honest one. Just good clean fun & violence. Being a movie freak I jumped to order both a Blu-ray & Director's release only to realize the horror that could have been. The re-cut (& re-cut & re-shuffled & re-cut again) version is an abomination. The movie has become BORING with all the extra introspective scenes into the Characters. You lose your affection for Gibson as he's now much more annoying to follow. Even the movie that jumps back & forth more would make even less sense had I not seen the original.

As a Filmmaker I know how difficult it is to tell a full story in a short film without loosing the essence of the story. Alex Kazan does a great job in telling a full story in less than 30 minutes.

It's political, it's action packed and has a good storyline. I also saw ""Payback"", another Alex Kazan short and can't wait to see that one released on DVD too.

1047818,5,6305480869,"I had heard about Mel Gibson redoing the third act for Payback, way back when I say it in the theater.  At the time, I really enjoyed the movie (rare for a Mel Gibson movie) and, from what I had heard, I honestly thought that it sounded like Mel had made it a better, more entertaining movie.  But having seen this version, I'm pleased to say I was very very wrong.  I had assumed that the movie would lose it's humor, feel too short, and less action-packed because of the loss of a Kris Kristofferson-ed third act.  I was surprised to find that not only did the movie remain darkly comic, but there was actually more action in the Straight Up version.  Changes for the positive include: cutting of the redundant voice over (something that had not bothered me in the theater, though I would hate to have it back), more strength coming from Maria Bello's character, and, most importantly, NO TORTURE.  True to form, Mel had added scenes of the character being tortured, which in retrospect should surprise NO ONE with any knowledge of the man's filmography.

Everything I loved about the Theatrical Cut remains intact, and plenty of things I didn't need, or outright disliked about the film have been removed.  Plus, the film looks GREAT on Blu-ray (assuming you're not an Anti-Grain Zealot), and has at least one candid documentary about the two versions, including new interviews with even Mel Gibson about the changes.

1047819,2,6305480869,"For me the first version of Payback, interfered with by the hand of (Mad)Mel is the much superior version of this dark, violent and gritty movie. This feels like to me to be another case of Superman II syndrome. Film fanatics harp on for years about how great it could have been had it not been interfered with and then when we finally see a version as close as possible to the directors intended vision it comes as somewhat of a disappointment. I bought Payback:-Directors Cut DVD unseen based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon but I now wish I had simply rented first instead of wasting my money. For me, the last third just felt flat. The third act rolled along slowly reducing pace as it went until finally coming to a gentle stop. Porter got his money, but for the audience the sense of achievement felt for what Porter went through in the original to get this money is now gone. I'm sure that had I not seen the original Payback, I still would feel the same way towards the third act in this version. I can also say for certain that this version suffers greatly by the exclusion of Kris Kristofferson as the original Bronson who brought a great sense of villainy to the role as a much larger, threatening character who also builds the anticipation of a confrontation between Bronson and Porter. In this version Bronson is nothing more than a woman's voice on a speaker and even at that injects nothing into the character. As a result she does not come across as someone who would be tough enough to have risen to the top of an organisation such as The Syndicate. Gibson in his version added a voice over monolog, while I can't say that I missed it from this directors cut, given the choice, I would rather have it in than out so I'd score Gibson on that one also. The shutout at the train station also seemed very poorly staged and felt like something you would see on an episode of Criminal Minds or CSI. Helgeland has not proven since Payback that he is in anyway a match for Gibson as a director. Helgeland's follow up to Payback was the somewhat popular but overrated A Knights Tale and the dreadful The Order. Both these movies speak for themselves in my opinion as to who knew best in the case of Payback. Perhaps if Heath Ledger was more of a star, he to might of had words with Helgeland's ability as a director. As for Gibson's version, I'd give it a solid 4 stars and I'd also have to agree with many other reviewers here on Amazon.com rating this directors cut very low. In short I think that Gibson did all the right things with his version and should be commended for doing an excellent job in rescuing this movie from what could have been a very forgettable movie experience even leaning towards losing the audience's attention in the third act to something much superior that can hold its head up as a modern day re-imaging of the great Point Blank with Lee Marvin. If you are a fan of the original cut then I'd recommend renting first before a purchase.",1187654400,54,2979,4.428051001821494
1047820,3,6305480869,"Directors Beware! On most occasions studios step in and destroy the Director's vision. This is a rare occasion when the big bad studio got it right. Brian Helgeland's cut is interesting and enjoyable, but it remains a pale shadow of the original release. The studio's recasting of the villian from female to a male was a masterstroke as Kris Kristofferson was one of the highlights of the original release. This Blu Ray Director's Cut eliminates my two favourite scenes - 'Happy Birthday' and 'Another Wrong Number'. Completely forgiveable if the original studio release was including in the Blu Ray 'Director's Cut' DVD. So, what do I have? A prettier, inferior version.",1187308800,4,671,5.054054054054054
1047821,4,6305480869,"1999's ""Payback"" is a violent mobster revenge saga featuring Mel Gibson as Porter, a career criminal who is betrayed at the critical moment of a heist by his partner (played with charming sleaze by Gregg Henry) and his wife. Porter is left for dead.

Fast-forward to a Porter now recovered from his wounds and out for revenge.  He proceeds to steal some cash for a road stake and work his way back through a collection of crime syndicate leaders, an Asian drug gang, and a couple of corrupt cops to get to his old partner and the money that is owed to him.

Along the way, Porter loses his unfaithful wife to a drug overdose; gets pushed around, beaten and tortured by various heavies; and finds an old girlfriend, a prostitute played with heart-of-gold charm by Maria Bello.  His persistent willingness to be just as vicious and tough as his adversaries causes the violence to escalate to a final all or nothing confrontation with the syndicate head, played with especially chilling menance by Kris Christoferson.

""Payback"" is an extremely violent movie, and Gibson's character, a classic anti-hero, could easily have become unlikeable. However, the storyline is sequenced to allow Porter some moral justification for each violent act he commits.  His limited goal of walking away at the end with his money and his woman makes Porter somehow more honest and more acceptable than the greedy, warped, and corrupt men with whom he deals.

This movie is recommended to Mel Gibson fans, especially those who enjoy his anti-hero roles.  Others may enjoy the slick pacing, harsh violence, and snappy dialogue of the movie.",1186790400,,1617,4.919117647058823

This version takes itself way too seriously. See the original theatrical version. Its just way more fun, period. I like an artsy fartsy movie as much as the next guy, but this falls way short. Its better seen for what it really is and to try to add integrity to a new and better, more serious directors cut is laughable in this case. I was seriously interested in what this version had to offer because ninety-nine percent of the time the directors cut is better that the original.

The new voice over for Kris Kristoffersen's character, Bronson, is done by a woman. The new scene with William Devane (Jack Bauer's nemesis) & Porter on the phone with Bronson, doesn't work for me.

From the very beginning, you know you're in different waters when the tone of the film settles in. They do away with the voice over and there is far less humor in this version. Instead of the blue tinted palatte of the original, this film has a more lush and natural quality to it. The character of Porter (Mel Gibson) in this version is even more brutal and cold blooded, which is a big reason as to why the film was asked to be recut by the studio. I watched both versions back to back and I think I can say that this new version is almost like watching an entirely different movie. I like them both equally and this new version really adds to the experience.

That being said, this HD-DVD has several great supplementary features that should make your day. One in particular is a half hour doc that goes into why Brian Helgeland's original cut was rejected by the studio and contains insightful comments by key members of the cast and crew, including Mel Gibson himself who I have to give credit to for being involved with restoring this version and giving a genuinely humbling interview.

1047912,4,6305480869,"Remaking a classic is never a good idea at the best of times, but when Brian Helgeland's remake of Point Blank ended up being shelved, heavily re-edited, rewritten (by Terry Hayes) and reshot by another director (production designer John Myhre) to make it more `accessible' to an audience after committing the triple sins of having a hero who doesn't get the money and doesn't get the girl and - worst of all - having a character kill the dog, it must have seemed like an out and out suicidal one. So much of the film's last third was dumped that half the footage in the film's trailer (and even its poster image) were nowhere to be found in the finished film itself by the time it made it to the theatres. Somehow the version of Payback that did get released turned out to be both surprisingly good and more surprisingly commercially successful, but now that, eight years later, Helgeland's finally had the chance to restore his version for DVD, the only response to the theatrical version's tagline `No more Mr Nice Guy' is ""Oh yeah?""

This time Mel Gibson's Porter doesn't have a voice over to excuse his actions, and they're not diluted by focus groups either. So he steals from a homeless guy? So what, it's not as if the guy is faking a disability in this cut, he just wants his money. So he asks a barman for information by breaking his hand? So what, he doesn't have time for subtlety, he just wants his money. So his wife O.D.s after he beats her up? So what, she shot him anyway, he just wants his money. So he kills a handcuffed heavy after disarming him? So what, he didn't like the guy, he just wants his money. In fact, Porter doesn't care what happens to anybody as long as he gets his money. The only thing that makes him the hero is that the guy who has his money is even worse than he is.

Unlike most Director's Cuts, this really is a very different version of the film: while the first hour has more or less the same structure as the theatrical version, the last third is a significant departure. Running some ten minutes less than the theatrical version, there's no convoluted kidnapping subplot, no Kris Kristofferson character in this version, only a couple of shots of prominently-billed John Glover at the end, though sadly no Angie Dickinson either: although originally providing a link with John Boorman's film as the voice of the syndicate boss in Helgeland's first cut, for some reason she's here replaced by Sally Kellerman on speakerphone. Instead we get a much better realized and rather more organic finale at a transit station that brings the film to a more convincing conclusion and is more attuned to the character's strengths and weaknesses than the kind of plot contrivances that gave the theatrical version its more explosive resolution. Oh yes, and everything doesn't look blue anymore.

There are differences from the first cut that Helgeland submitted that was floating around as a bootleg for years - the fire truck diversion to get into the outfit hotel and the infamous elevator scene where Porter blinds a henchman are missing, while this time round the money doesn't end up in the hands of a homeless guy - but while it's a shame these aren't included on the DVD, it's a leaner, meaner movie, playing it down and dirty (none of Boorman's ""Is he really dead?"" ambiguity here) and on its own terms. Is it a great film or a lost masterpiece? No, just a good movie with a heart of darkness underneath the studio sheen, but that's good enough for me.

Paramount's DVD is a good package, with a three-part documentary on the making and unmaking of the film (with Gibson surprisingly prominent among the new interviews) and an interview with author Donald E. Westlake that run longer than the main feature itself, as well as an audio commentary by Helgeland.",1178668800,9,3798,4.630563798219584
1047913,5,6305480869,"A lot of the ""Director's Cuts"" I've seen don't do much to justify their existence.  They have a few ""cut"" scenes dropped in, but most of the time they interrupt the pacing and offer no real change to the film.  The term has become synonymous with ""Unrated Cut"" and comes off as a marketing gimmick to get people to shell out for the same movie again.

I haven't seen the original cut of Payback since probably 2000, but I remember enjoying it.  It was a gritty crime film with a good dose of humor and Mel's trademark ""I love being tortured"" shtick.  I rented this director's cut to see how it played, since it was apparently a dramatic difference rather than a few new scenes thrown in here and there.

I'd say the new cut is a much better movie than the old one.  It eliminates Mel's narration, which I think greatly improves the way Mel's character is explored.  We get to watch it rather than hear it, so he is now Porter rather than Mel Gibson.  One of the strengths of this character is that we don't fully understand his motivations (see also Point Blank with Lee Marvin); we have the duration of the film to try and understand his code, his principles, and the original narration spoiled the process.

Another change is the filtering.  The movie is no longer entirely washed out blue, it's full of warm tones as well as cool.  I like this as well.  It still fits the mood of the movie, and it's more visually pleasing.

As for new scenes, I couldn't really tell what was added in.  I could tell what was removed, which was the kidnapping sub-plot, Kris Kristofferson's character, and the subsequent torture and escape.  The new cut features a tidier finale, and the whole movie is actually shorter than the original cut.  It clocks in at around 90 minutes, which works for this story.  I remember liking Porter's escape scene in the original (clawing his way through the backseat), but I think the new cut keeps the pace consistently and serves the story better.

It's definitely worth checking out.",1178582400,14,2007,4.540389972144847
1047914,4,6305480869,"If you're not familiar with the original theatrical release of 'Payback', you should be.  If you are, then you probably can tell from the reviews the version on this DVD is rather different, especially in its ending.  I have read several of Donald Westlake's Parker (Porter in the movie) novels, as well as having enjoyed Point Blank and some of the other Parker film incarnations.
For me, I tend to agree with one of the other reviewers who said it would have been nice to take the theatrically released version of the film and this version and somehow mesh the two.
Things I liked about the original released version of 'Payback' were Mel's voice-overs and the blue washed look.  They gave the film a gritty, kind of noir-ish look and feel.  Also, I liked the original soundtrack better, although this new version is almost as good.  Although I did not care for Kris Kristofferson playing Bronson, the character of Bronson in the book ""The Hunter"" was male, and so Sally Kellerman's voice as the head of the Outfit seemed rather out of place.
For this version, I did enjoy the added scenes during the first 70% of the film.  I also tended to like the ending in the director's cut compared to the other version.  Go ahead and kill the dog!  As for the money, we don't know if Porter actually got it since we're not sure if Porter makes it or not, which I think would have made a better ending (in the book, Parker does get out alive and even manages to cross paths with the Outfit again).
Of all of the Parker novels that have been adapted for the big screen, this one and ""The Outfit"" with Robert Duvall and Joe Don Baker are probably the closest to the original written works.
I have to say I am not as pleased as I hoped I would be after seeing this director's cut.  It's not a significant improvement from the previous version.  Yes, it really is like another film, and so I classify it as fairly good in it's own right.",1178064000,4,1925,4.427762039660057
1047915,4,6305480869,"Before studio execs and Mel Gibson got all uppity with Brian Helgeland, Payback was a darker, meaner film. But after an apparently poor test screening in 1997(honestly, what IS the point of these?) they put Payback on hold for over a year so Mel could do Lethal Weapon 4 before going back for some re-shoots, with a new director, to make the film happier.

So they approved a script of a dark, moody revenge thriller, green-lighted it for production and changed their minds to make it lighter because a ragtag audience didn't understand/like it? Man, Hollywood is one weird town.

The resulting film, which was eventually released in 1999, seemed a bit tacked together. There were scenes that just seemed out of place and irregular. It was obvious that any scene actually shot back in 1997 was shot on location and any scene shot for the 1999 cut was just shot in the generic 'street set' on the Warner back-lot. Despite all of this, Payback was still a fun film that failed to go all the way with it's concept.

The new DC is a superior version, no doubt and is about 33% different. There are new scenes and odds and ends through out the running time and the last act is completely different. Kris Kristoffersen is gone and replaced by Sally Kellerman (voice only, Bronson is never seen). James Coburn and John Glover also have smaller roles. The narration from Porter is gone as well as the blue tint to most of the film. Now most scenes are just lit as normal without any post-production filtering.

There is also a new musical score. The jazzy feel to the opening scenes is still there but through-out the rest of the film the score is more atmospheric and understated. Both are as good as each and fit the differing tones, so there's no better of the two.

It does end a bit abruptly and without any truly satisfying conclusion. I guess this is what annoyed test audiences. But a disgruntled audience should not be a decision-making committee when it comes to making movies.

The HD DVD is in glorious 2.4:1 1080p with Dolby Digital+ sound and loads of extras.",1177977600,11,2065,4.5978260869565215

1047917,4,6305480869,"What I was hoping for in the director's cut of Payback is extended roles for Maria & Lucy. Lucy is absolutely hilarious in this film, with some great lines (""I need some satisfaction""), and her interaction with Porter (""I have a few minutes"", ""Go boil an egg"") was just magnificent. There is some extension to the scene where Rosie & Porter meet up again, and she gets more of a part in the finale of the film. But Lucy definitely needed more of a role!

Having watched both versions of Payback within the same day, I was shocked at how different they are. The original version of Payback is a lot darker, almost black & white in some parts, but this version keeps the colour. The beginning loses the opening of a doctor digging bullets out of Porter's back, and starts with him returning to the city, with no indication of a double-cross just yet until the flashback appears. It also appears to be cut together much better, and give the first few scenes a much quicker feeling. Porter no longer has a voiceover either. The scene with his wife is extended as well, leading to a more brutal confrontation, which leads more into him carrying her into the bedroom. Also, Porter the dog doesn't survive in this version. Big a[...] The torture scenes are also cut from the film, and the boss's son who was originally going to get together with Rosie as his birthday present.

The finale is a load better, as in the old version, I did find myself getting bored, but the finale is more abrupt, and unexpected. Maria Bello gets a bigger role in the finale, although it does leave viewers hanging a bit, but I won't spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it yet.

The only thing I'm gutted at is the low-class hooker, who Porter approaches when he's looking for Rosie, is completely cut from the film. Which is a shame, as she totally reminded me of the hooker from Pretty Woman that was Julia Robert's roommate. She's funny as well, despite the shortness of her scene.

Overall, I have to say I prefer the director's cut of Payback. Sometimes you find with some directors cuts, they tend to go a bit OTT, and keep in all the scenes which really weren't necessary, but this is well edited, and changing the finale was a really good idea. And seeing it in HD is well worth while too, if you can get your hands on it. I do like the idea of having it almost black & white, and I did miss it in this version.

I thought the picture looked sharp at times but certain scenes contained excessive grain; the sound was often at odds with what the viewer was seeing; and in general the movie didn't seem to have a relevent conclusion.

Shot and narrated in a very pulpy style, Payback almost seems like a gritty 1970s revenge thriller. But it doesn't seem to go all the way and injects humor into the proceedings, which contrasts with the genre. The humor is entertaining and works as a breather between the action scenes, but it would have been a better and more original film if it was tough all the way through.

I guess that the producers wanted Payback to be more of a Lethal Weapon movie rather than an homage to Point Blank or Death Wish. It can't be written-off though. For what it is, it's very entertaining, fast-moving and witty. Just not the kind of film it was aiming to be.

""Payback"" is back, this time the way the director envisioned the film, not the suits. ""You don't make pictures for the elite,"" producer/star Mel Gibson says today, explaining why Paramount and Warner Bros. took the noirish gangland movie away from freshman director Brian Helgeland. After 10 days of reshoots, a new final (third) act was tacked on, voiceover was added a la ""Blade Runner"" and Kris Kristofferson walked on as a new major character. Audiences still were amazed how brutal the Gibson character was when they had to ""Get ready to root for the bad guy,"" as the marketing had it.

Same old story about artists and Hollywood, but this time came a happier ending. In 2005, Paramount and Gibson gave Helgeland another shot at the film, eight years after its release. The tapes turned up missing, so Helgeland and his editor recut the film using film. And so we have ""Payback: Straight Up -- the Director's Cut.""

Now, this is one hard-boiled movie. Gibson plays a criminal who comes back to town looking for the partner who stole half his loot, and his wife, following a heist. Along the way he single-handedly takes on both the syndicate and Asian drug dealers, slugs a woman (a scene the studios cut), and stirs up a John Woo-like shootout as the bloody finale. Supporting actors Lucy Liu, Gregg Henry and Maria Bello all do fine work.

There are multiple DVD extras, including a director's commentary, but the one to catch is the half-hour ""Same Story -- Different Movie,"" all about the film's resurrection. Audio and video are sharp on the DVD -- and better on high definition discs, although in places the colors seem a bit too jacked up for a gritty, bleach-bypass film.

Why a Director's Cut? And why given that Icon Productions must have blessed the original release, do they want to go to the well a second time? Is Mel running out of money and/or ideas?

I see the hand of Mel Gibson all over the first edition of this movie - you know what I am talking about - the ratcheting up of the violence so lovingly inflicted on Porter before the movie's ultimate payback. Mel always has to go through the violence wringer before emerging on the other side as the tempered and hardened ""hero"" who, because of his suffering is in a dubious way, morally justified in exacting even greater carnage on the bad guys - who are only really ""badder guys"" than Mel's character.

In this Director's Cut edition, the denouement doesn't have the cathartic release of the original. It is just a continuation of all the shooting.

As Salieri said in ""Amadeus"" ""you have to give them a big bang at the end so they know when to clap"". That ""big bang"" is sadly missing in this new edition. HEck, you don't even see if he is wearing a vest. But as this is Mel Gibson we are talking about, I guess he is simply, bullet proof.

The plus side of this movie is that it has two of my favorite actresses in it - both are tragically underused - I refer of course to Deborah Kara Unger and the ever watchable Maria Bello.",1176595200,8,1325,4.305220883534137
1047944,5,6305480869,"I don't own a copy of the original cut, and it's been a while since I've seen the original cut.

A short review of THIS version is as follows.

The film print is FLAWLESS in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70's or 80's on purpose. The blue filter is gone, so it doesn't look slick and shiny. This film is dark, rich, and grungy. Very ""noir-ish"", and warm.

Obviously the running gag through out the first film was that Porter wants his 70k back... not 130k or 1 million, just 70k. This was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it. The first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again.

Porter in this film is not charming or smooth. He's smart, violent, and cold. A true anti-hero. The annoying voice over narration is gone. There are several new characters, and several new brutal kills.

Minus the credits, this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes.

This is a great companion piece to the great ""To Live and Die in L.A."" It got the same mood.

1047945,4,6305480869,"Well, for once we have a movie that really is a new cut according to the director's wishes and not just add on to the movie. This is a superb hard hitting Mel Gibson movie that won a lot of fans when it was released. It seems to get better with age. No need to waste time time going over the plot since anyone reading this would know it already. But now, we have an ""original"" version of this film on this DVD. This DVD edition of Payback is considerably different from the version we saw in the theaters as well as the DVD that came out since then (in 1999 I believe). Not only the last 30% of the movie have been totally altered but there have been cuts and additions along the first 70% of the film. But the basic story still remains the same, just the plot twists and turned differently.

I read that this original version was to have been the version to appears in the theaters but it didn't reviewed well initially so entire last part of the film was reshot, creating Kris Kristofferson's role as the leader of the bad guys and his demise. But in this original, Kristofferson's character never appears and the original concept of a woman boss who is never seen, voiced by Sally Kellerman according to the credits and the ending is totally different from the theaterial version. Outside of the outright changes in the scenes, the blue tint of the theaterial version have been removed as well as Mel Gibson's voice over.

I watched both movies back to back just to see which one I like the best. I hate to write this but I had a hard time making up my mind on this. Both versions are pretty good and each version, ironically, carried great deal of merits. I really wish that both versions could be merge into one!! This is really subjective depending on the viewer's taste and understanding of the movie. But if I have to pick, I would perfer the theaterial version because its darker, more tighter and I like seeing Kris Kristofferson in a meaty role. The theater's version also put a finale to the story while the ""original"" version leave a loose ends since that female boss is still out there seeking payback of her own. Above all the theater's version make Porter more human and vulnerable while the ""original"" version make him more slick and super agent like.

But each viewer have to decide on their own on this one. I enjoyed the ""original"" version but maybe not as much as I enjoyed the theater version. Each to his own as they say.

I should also say that this ""original"" version is also 11 minutes shorter then the theaterial version, reflecting a shorter ending of the ""original"" to the theaterial version.

The DVD come with a well presented quality in its images and sounds. It come with several extras including a very interesting one that tell the story behind the difference between the theaterial version and the ""original"" version.

1047948,5,6305480869,"When Payback was originally released in 1999, it was surrounded by a bit of controversy when it was reported that the studio was not happy with writer/director Brian Helgeland's original cut and with Mel Gibson's approval, the actor filmed a new third act with the addition of Kris Kristofferson to the cast. This version was not that well received as audiences were put off by the cast of generally unlikable characters. However, over the years, bootleg copies of Helgeland's original rough cut began to circulate among fans of the film that revealed a significantly different version. Surprisingly, Paramount has allowed the filmmaker to revisit his film and release his version on DVD.

Helgeland sets the tone right from the start with a 1970s style font for the opening credits and the old school musical score that evokes Don Siegel's crime films from the 1960s and `70s. Helgeland even names an establishment Varrick's after Siegel's heist movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charley-Varrick/dp/B0003JANSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charley Varrick</a>. He is clearly a fan of `70s era crime films as Porter's ruthless methods to find Val echo the same cutthroat methods Robert Duvall employs in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outfit/dp/6304286848/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outfit</a>, another adaptation of a Stark novel (actually the sequel to The Hunter).

Helgeland presents a world populated by corrupt cops, weasely fixers, hookers with hearts of gold and sadistic gangsters - all the hallmarks of an uncompromising crime film. This version of Payback is a vast improvement over the theatrical release with the voiceover removed and the implausible ending changed. Also gone is Kris Kristofferson and his whole subplot including the prerequisite Gibson torture scene. The new ending is much more fitting and consistent with the rest of the movie. It is great to see Helgeland's vision finally seeing the light of day and this once flawed movie restored to its much more superior version free from the meddlesome tampering of studios and test screenings.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Brian Helgeland. The filmmaker explains that he could never change the ending of his movie because it was always intended to be an homage to the ending of Cool Hand Luke (1967). He talks about and defends the decisions he made in the film. This is an insightful and informative track with Helgeland pointing out what is new in this cut of the film.

""Paybacks are a Bitch"" takes a look at the making of the film at the location shooting in Chicago and Los Angeles. This extra takes us through the production with new interviews with Helgeland, Gibson, Unger and key crew members with an excellent, in-depth look at how it all came together.

""Same Story - Different Movie, Creating Payback: The Director's Cut"" examines how this new version came together. Originally, the studio was expecting an accessible, Lethal Weapon-style movie and wanted to change the ending. Gibson went along with the studio but Helgeland refused and walked away from it all while the actor wrote and directed a new ending, a prologue setting up who the character was and voiceover spelling things out. In 2005, Gibson allowed Helgeland to restore his original cut.

Finally, there is ""The Hunter: A Conversation with author Donald E. Westlake."" Richard Stark was a pen name for Westlake as he wrote mystery novels annually under his actual name but wrote a lot more material that he wanted to publish. So, he ended up writing stripped down crime novels for men. He talks about the creation of the Parker character (Porter in the film), the origins of the Richard Stark moniker and some of the movie adaptations of his work.",1176336000,4,3815,5.37123745819398

I'm glad the director finally got his movie and way to go paramount this is not some hoax special edition like so many others its a diffrent kind of film a special edition worth picking up for sure...way to go Paramount",1176163200,57,952,4.804878048780488

Finally, a movie where Mel Gibson is the bad guy. But he's a really good bad guy, if you know what I mean. It's a powerhouse of a movie that is about one thing:revenge. But not just some pithy little sour note. No. This movie is a kick in the face right off the bat. There's humor, action, crime, drama, and it's based on the novel ""THE HUNTER.""

When I saw this, I thought it would be totally different than what I expected. But it has a snazzy way of introducing it's plot. There's betrayal, mixed in with a little film noir, smothered in high tycoons and henchmen, not to mention the chinese mob, and a little dash of the porter attitude. Don't get him wrong. Porter used to be a really nice guy, really good criminal too. But now, he's become a force that no one wants to mess with. There are just so many things that make this movie good. Snappy lines, cool suits, flawed characters, the works. And in a movie of this magatude; you gotta have the works, buddy. Enjoy!",1141516800,5,1148,4.242009132420091

1048056,3,6305480869,"Considering thirty percent of this movie had to be reshot when Brian Helgeland was replaced as director, you'd expect there to be all sorts of continuity problems, especially as the re-shoots resulted in a delay of almost one year, because Mel Gibson was committed to Lethal Weapon 4 right after principal photography ended. But the film turns out pretty well in the end.

Despite the fact Mel Gibson isn't ageing too well, since his days as Mad Max, and the constant cigarette in hand (I was told I wouldn't like this movie due to this), if you can ignore the cigarette, then the film passes quickly. If you want to call Mel all the names under the sun because he's stupid to be ruining his looks by smoking, then you'll probably want to punch the screen every time he smokes. I dread to think how many cigarettes he smoked during production. And poor Maria Bello had to kiss him. Ugh.

The use of guns in this movie is quite shocking, every character seems to have at least one gun, and while Lucy Liu (credited as Lucy Alexis Liu) evens it out by doing her high kicks, it's just pure violence at its best. (Including some very surprising scenes between Lucy Liu and the bad guy - that's supposed to turn people on, beating the daylights out of each other?! Right) There are some scenes, especially towards the end, which will definitely give you flashbacks to Braveheart. You expect Mel to yell ""Freedom"" at any moment! Think this little piggy went to market, and you'll be curling your toes, until they're meeting your ankles.

In the first few minutes of the movie, he has stolen from a 'crippled' Vietnam veteran, pickpocketed a man's wallet, stiffed a waitress, and used the said credit card to buy a nice fancy suit, a gun, and dinner. Later, when his meal is over, a waiter informs him the credit card he is trying to pay with has been canceled. ""Nonsense,"" Porter says. ""Try it again."" The waiter then leaves and so does Porter. (Can't they trace him?) Mel does some voice over in the movie, in one of the most sadistic voices I've ever heard.

The movie's very dark, and it's a surprise to see such a cheery character as Maria Bello (best known to me as Lil from Coyote Ugly, although the long hair put me off from recognising her). Mel Gibson is pretty good in this, despite the smoking, but I'll let him off with that. He's obviously gonna suffer in later years. Worthwhile getting this movie, as long as you don't get offended by violence, and Lucy Liu getting smacked around.",1093392000,,2490,4.538975501113586
1048057,4,6305480869,"This 1999 noir owes alot to its genre predecessors that were prevalent during the late 60's and most of the 70's. Films like Eastwood's Dirty Harry films, Charles Bronson's Death Wish series, and especially Lee Marvin's Point Blank which Payback was a worthy remake.

For a first time director, writer Brian Helgeland uses every rule set by past noir films to create Payback. We have a colorful rogues gallery of heavies. Some range from your non-typical femme fatale/dominatrix gangstress Pearl played ably and with relish by Lucy Lui to the three leaders of the so-called ""Outfit"": Kris Kristofferson, William Devane and James COburn. These three actors eat up the time they have on the screen and combined the coolness factor of Payback increases threefold. A special mention of Coburn's Mr. Fairfax character has to be made. His portrayal of the flamboyant gangster makes for alot of funny lines whenever he's on.

Another noir plot staple Payback relies on was the revenge factor of the main character against those who he thinks has done him an unforgivable wrong. It's this role that Gibson excels and holds the entire film from falling into self-parody. Mel Gibson is very underrated as an actor and Payback will probably not change that, but if one looked closely his portrayal of Porter throughout the film is very subtle and at the same time direct. We know that Porter is the good guy and Gibson playing him we're convinced from the start, but throughout the film Porter's actions and behavior doesn't distinguish him apart from those other rogues in the film. We may cheer for Porter, but we inwardly we also cringe at some of the stuff he does and does so without hesitation. To Porter what he does is a means to an end. Porter's the lesser of the evils in Payback. Gibson's performance is convincing and believable.

Lastly, Payback's dialogue sounds like it could've been lifted from an old Bogart and Cagney noir. Helgeland's script is very lean and memorable. It seems that almost every character gets a chance to have a small exposition about the life of crime. Where L.A. Confidential (Helgeland also wrote the script for that fine film) was a serious take on the noir genre, Payback has an almost tongue-in-cheek fun angle to it. From the look of the cast and their performance it shows they're having fun.

Payback is not the greatest film out there and not even the best and greatest i nthe last 20 years, but it is a fun and enjoyable romp through the noir world that only exists in detective and mystery novels and especially on celluloid.",1091923200,2,2564,4.807256235827665
1048058,5,6305480869,"Having Mel Gibson play such a lowdown creature as Porter is original enough in its own right.  The fact that he plays him so well and that we root for him only goes to show the magnetic power of this charismatic performer.  Briskly helmed by Brian Helgeland (he'll win an Oscar someday!), this flick moves like lightning and offers Gibson a chance to off Gregg Henry, William Devane, David Paymer, James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson.  That's no small feat.  The atmosphere is perfect, the musical score sublime, the overall effect cheesily gratifying.  Maria Bello is fine as Gibson's love interest, too, and we can't overlook Porter the Dog.  An involving and entertaining noir film.",1081209600,3,685,4.964912280701754

1048130,5,6305480869,"""Payback"" hails back to the seventies type movies where rooting for the bad guy is the whole point of the movie and it works quite successfully in this first-rate film.  Mel Gibson does an terrific job of playing the bad guy that you really want to root for.  Fair warning to the light of heart and young ones though, for this film is not for them.  Sticking with Mel Gibson's type of film making, the realism in this film is astonishing and could be considered rather shocking.
Given that this is an entirely different type of movie for Mel Gibson in which he is the hero of the film but his character isn't quite the ""hero"" type, I found his performance to be exceptional, but then again, name a film where his performance wasn't exceptional.  Maria Bello of ""ER"" fame stars as Mel Gibson's love interest and she performs quite well in this film.  Gregg Henry who plays the ""true"" bad guy of the film and he does a great job of playing the extraordinarily sadistic mafia ""wannabe.""  Kris Kristofferson plays the ""mob"" boss of the film.  Lucy Alexis Liu performs quite ""scarily"" as the masochistic/sadistic call girl with some interesting associates.
This is the first film from Director Brian Helgeland that I've seen and he certainly deserves a great amount of praise for bringing the novel ""The Hunter"" by Richard Stark to the silver screen and DVD format.  This film is certainly the last of its type in the twentieth century!  The sound track for the film matches perfectly with the entire ""feel"" and atmosphere of the film, greatly enhancing the experience.
The premise:
Mel Gibson plays Porter who, while being little more than a common criminal is not so much a common criminal as the film unfolds.  As the film opens Porter is retelling the recent events of his life after he's been shot and has now recovered enough to make his way back to New York City and he's on a mission.  We soon learn that he and Val Resnick had planned and executed the robbery of $130,000 from a Chinese organized crime group and that when it came time to divide the money between himself and his wife and Val, Val had been conspiring with Porter's wife, showing her a picture of Porter and Rosie (Maria Bello).  Porter's wife shoots him in the back.  He's now recovered and he's coming to town, looking for his $70,000 and to kill Val Resnick.
What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most brilliant films of its type where Mel Gibson brings his style of acting to the forefront where he can throw in some well placed and funny lines in the most serious of situations for his character.
I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre as you will soon find that it bears many viewings quite easily and all the way through you'll be ""rooting for the bad guy.""  {ssintrepid}

Gibson however plays the character Parker from Donald E. Westlake's novels cold.  As the ruthless and cold blooded Porter he scours the city seeking out his money.  During a deal gone wrong his partner shoots him, takes off with his wife, and then gives the money to the outfit.  As part of a coke deal he wasted Henry plays Val well and to the point but he sticks around for to long as trying to be colder and harder then the Mal in the novel.  What makes this movie shine is performances by Coburn, Kirstoffson, Paymer, and Devane they are all cut throat seeking for a way out.  Coburn and Kristoffoson give turns as the two premier crime bosses trying to stiff out Porter.  While Paymer plays a greedy cab owner and Devane plays the boss of the hitmen.

Director, Brian Helgeland carries this ice-cold film off with style, displaying razor-sharp intelligence and lethal doses of sardonic wit.

Not a theme I would normally give 5 stars to, but the movie is so well done that you find yourself rooting for the main character Porter (played by Mel Gibson) during all the heart pounding, palm-sweating action.

The movie opens with a severely injured Porter getting bullets removed from his back. After he recuperates he goes back to the streets to get his revenge on the people who did this to him.  In the form of a very well done flashback about a robbery with his partner in crime and a wife who drives the getaway car, you learn what brought him to this point.  Well, his best buddy has managed to turn his wife against him, so when they go to an isolated area to split up the money he is double-crossed by his wife and his friend, shot in the back and left for dead.  Hence begins the movie with all its action.  Porter decides that it is literally payback time and goes after his friend, then after the Organization (the mob) to get his money.  He manages to get every bad guy in town ticked off at him.  What follows is a thrill ride of action and minor plot twists that leave you breathless!

1048204,2,6305480869,"Payback is based on the 1967 film, Point Blank. However, Payback doesn't even come close to the original film. In the original film of Point Blank the actors put their all into their roles, here it just seems to me that they are just going through the motions. I really didn't care if the Mel Gibson character (Porter) got his money or not. While in Point Blank I was actually rooting for the Lee Marvin character (Walker). The villains in Payback are terrible. The actors playing them again just seem to be going through the motions in order to collect a paycheck. William Devane, James Coburn, and Kris Kristofferson were wasted in this film. I didn't believe for a moment that they were crime bosses. The original film, Point Blank, used the talents of Carol O'Conner, Keenan Wynn, John Vernon, and Lloyd Bochner to perfection. A major problem with remakes of old films is that the producers and/or directors feel they have to add a lot of violence in the form of shootouts, explosions, car chases, and vulgar dialog to make up for a poor script. This film needs all of that in order to make up for the actors dead performances. The only salvation of this film are the women. Lucy Liu and Maria Bello are very pleasant on the eyes. I'm going to sum up my review by saying that if you want a no-brain shoot `em up action film, Payback will deliver. However, if you want a tense, gripping, and intelligent film view the original film, Point Blank.",1022457600,6,1448,4.551724137931035

Mel stars as the quintessential thug. A ""baddie"" who is ripped off by an even ""badder baddie"" and this badder baddies adjoining syndicate.

The actors in this movie are all terrific. Lucy Liu and Gregg Henry (the latter perennially depicts unsavory fiends) are prime actors of the psychopathic stripe, James Coburn relates as a mob boss who is more concerned with baggage (of the transportation type), rather than human life and the seductive Maria Bello as the pained Rosie.

I watched this movie and I thought to myself. . .

. . .""self, this is why I go to the movies to escape the cold cruel hard meanness of today's world.""

This movie is escapism--in the dark recesses of the theatre--at its very finest. Enjoy this movie as entertainment (but it is too bad many parents in today's society, as Kris Kristofferson's Bronson character, don't teach their offspring not to emulate and grow up to be one of these predatory, menacing types of creeps).

In the middle of a job, Mel Gibson is double crossed by his partner, shot in the back by his wife, robbed, and left for dead.  When he returns he let's loose the devil on a quest to regain his honor and his money.
 This movie is vibrantly new since the hero is no longer forced into doing heroic deeds like every other hero in Hollywood, but merely does what will get him to his goal.  In fact, none of the characters have been made by the cookie cutter we so commonly see in Hollywood.  This movie is a wild ride of unpredictable twists and turns, that hit you right out of the black.  But best of all, the pace; this movie jumps from action scene to action scene in one long heart beat, but still brings in the rage and passion of the characters that drive  you and the action to the final explosion.

1048208,3,6305480869,"I do not like an action movie like this style. Anyway, when it comes to playing tough guys, Mel Gibson usually manages to remain a good guy, no matter how violent, psychotic, or barbaric his character. After all those years of playing a nice guy, he finally has a chance to play something different. In Payback, Mel is one of the bad guys, but make no mistake, he is still the hero. Gibson plays a robber named Porter, who at the start of the story is having bullets surgically removed from his back. It seems like an occupational hazard. Play for the bad guys long enough, and eventually you will wind up regretting it. However, as Porter tells us, five months of lying around did not exactly change his disposition. If anything, it made him angry.

Porter, now healed and fueled by thoughts of revenge, attempts to find his partner, Val and retrieve the $70,000 stolen from him. There is no finesse, greasing of palms, or clever detective work. Porter is not a subtle man. Once he gets a lead, he follows it, heedless of the danger or the people who are members of a syndicate known as ""the Outfit"" that he is confronting. There is desperation in every play Porter makes, as if he does not care if he lives or dies any more. His wife has overdosed on heroine. His former lover, Rosie is a hooker. Two crooked cops are watching every move he makes, determined to steal the money from him if he can find it. In addition, to make matters worse, Val has told the Japanese gangsters from whom they stole the money that Porter was behind the whole thing.
 Finally, this is a Hollywood movie which is always think about box-office power, and always main character is superhuman, nice and has all good things. Sometimes it is very unrealistic and childish like this film. Mel Gibson, actually he play an ill-matched character in this film. It is an uninteresting film except some interesting casting. For example, James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson who usually had played in Action movies. Deborah Unger, she played in Crash (1996). She was very impressive. Lucy Liu, she played in Charlies angels (2000).

This film seems to expect you to! There is no one you can really care for, but even so, after the first half of the film, which is just a glorification of mindless violence (and we wonder why kids are getting so violent!!!), in the most unsubtle and unbelieveble way possible, the story tries to make up place our sympathy with Mel and his call-girl ""friend"". No. it just doesn't wash! The first half seems serious in a way, but the second half just degenerated into parody! It starts to get so ridiculous, what with all the things Mel goes through to get back his 70 grand, when he could have much more. What sort of a criminal is he anyway? Not a very bright one by any means! A total disappointment. Put any lesser-known actors and actrices in this and you know that this wouldn't have made it anywhere.

But, I think this movie could have been better if Mel had just been a little more trusting in the moviegoing public, and gone the whole nine yards with the ruthlessness of his character. Perfect example: Stegman: ""You're not gonna kill me, are ya?"" Porter: ""Well, not in front of these kids."" WHAT??? The character I know, Parker from the Westlake novels; Parker, the ruthless ice-cold professional embodied by Lee Marvin in ""Point Blank""; he would've bitchslapped Porter for even thinking ""Not-in-front-of-these-kids"" and kicked him to the curb. Unnecessary heroism aside, this a pretty good movie, with Mel as the irrepressible, slightly off-center goofball he's played in all his crowd-pleasers, but tightened up a notch here. Aside from him, the other main strength is the great ensemble: James Coburn, David Paymer, Bill Duke, Kris Kristofferson, Maria Bello, and Bill Devane. Also, from personal experience, it's a great compromise for the Saturday movie nights when you and your girlfriend can't agree on what to watch.

Of course in the movie it is really bad guys that are ""getting it"" so we don't feel quite so bad rooting for Gibson to get um where it hurts. A lot of people die in this flick, and to be honest it has absolutely no redeeming social value, it is just entertaining.
The basic story line is that Gibson gets screwed out of some money by a ""friend"" and the money ends up going to the mob.  He wants his money back and is willing to kill and/or die to get it.  Simple plot.  A lot of violence.
If you enjoy a hard action flick and aren't offended by violence, swearing and a few sexual situations (but not really very graphic ones) than you'll enjoy the entertainment value of this movie.  If you want a ""thinking movie"" look elsewhere.",1005350400,2,958,4.236263736263736
1048282,5,6305480869,"I first caught this right at the beginning as it was coming on one of the cable channels, and was hooked into the story instantly.

 From the opening of Mel having bullets removed from his back by a degenerate drinking the same Whisky he sterilizes with, up until the very end (can't ruin that with a discription in case you've not seen it)...this one kept me riveted. The strangely blue smokey color quality throughout the film, only seems to add to the hard-boiled atmosphere of gritty N.Y.City, heat rising and making a clock ripple in a mirage, letting you know just how hot the action will get.

The characters are very well drawn. Porter, our anti-hero, who we find out by flashback how he got to be so determined to get back 70K; is a career criminal who has fine-tuned his craft to an art form. He seems to effortlessly pick pockets, bang out stolen credit cards, and pawn swag for the cash and hardware he needs to obtain his ""share"" in a heist with Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). Val is a man who loves pain, giving it, and getting it too. He is valued by the ""Outfit"" for his ""sadistic lack of compunction"". His domiatrix galpal, portrayed by a hilariously over the top Lucy Liu is similarly inclined. Add 2 crooked DTs and the cab dispatcher/heroin dealer they shake down, plus other assorted amusing ""bad"" guys, all played by well known actors, and you can't miss. John Glover, (maybe you know him as the man who loved to call Roy Scheider ""sport"" in John Frankenhimers ""52 Pick-Up""), has a minor role as William Devanes right hand man, but my favorite cameo was veteran actor James Coburn. After finding out ""Carter"" played by Devane, is dead, he says to Porter, ""Probably better off anyway, poor buck-toothed ba$tard!!"" Hilarious!!  I also loved Lucy, Liu that is, when her Pearl dominatrix character beats up her boytoy Val , and says ""Love you baby, long time"", as she kicks him where no man can take it.

Needless to say, a staple I've watched over and over. This is definitely one of my top favorite action movies. It will become one of yours too.

If you love the theatrical version, also see the alternative ending directors cut. Personally I think it was wise to re-shoot it with a different ending and alternate characters. Watch and you'll see why.  Interestingly, Porter's narrative which is quite effective, is not present in the directors cut, nor is the blue tint, and the score is different. It is fun to compare both, so make sure to  see both versions.",1002931200,4,2479,4.605442176870748

I guess they say bad guy because he's a robber...but he has feelings and he is funny. The story is EXTREMELY SIMPLE; a guy steals 14000 dollars and his associate(allied with Porter's wife) and the associate(which is one ofTHE BAD GUYS of the film)shoots Porter and thinks he is dead. And later, Porter steals a guy's wallet, buys a gun and goes back in town to get his money back(and kill his associate by the way). Like I said, Payback's good point is the characters, not the story. The scenario is cool and funny, and the atmosphere is creepy. I think this is a remake of the movie Point Blank, that was great too.

One scene in particular, which involves Gibson and a low-life who must have regreted the day he had a nose-ring fitted, is so shocking that you've just got to laugh. Gibson could never have been expected to play the role of Porter as coldly as Lee Marvin (as Parker) did in Point Blank, the 60s thriller that Payback updates. To those that criticise Gibson for this, my response is that his talent as a comic actor far outweigh Marvin's, and as much as I enjoyed Point Blank, I found Gibson's Porter to be a much more watchable character, one who entertained me more than Marvin's character. Gibson delivers a performance that was reminiscent of Steve McQueen: slightly emotionally detached from the chaos that played around him, but always in control.

The rest of the movie involves Porter trying to get his money back ($70 000).  Naturally, some people need to be shot, blown up, beat up, etc. for this to happen.  Because Porter is a thief and a killer, the movie has a dark, anti-hero kind of tone.  Adding to the atmosphere is the fact that everyone wears black or grey, there always seems to be steam coming up from the sewers, and the building are all drab and dirty.
I enjoyed this movie, and was struck by the quality of the performances, and the fact that a lot of big names are involved.  Of special note are Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn as two of the bad guys, and Lucy Lui as a dominatrix and member of the Triads (even when dressed in leather bikini and fishnet stockings, you had to take her more seriously than in Charlie's Angels).  In addition, suberb performances are put forward by Mel and Maria Bello (why, oh why would she associate herself with Coyote Ugly?!).  The action scenes are well done, and unlike the Lethal Weapon movies, the abuse that Mel's body survives is almost believable.  It is also quite funny, in a wry, ironic way (like when Coburn's character complains that Mel shot a hole in his suits - ""That's just mean!"").
However, there's nothing really special about the film.  It's just a bunch of stuff that happens, and it doens't really stand out in my mind over other action movies of the same sort.  In addition, the DVD edition is very disappointing.

Gibson, appearing more haggard and balding than ever, is quite  appealing.  It's good to see Mel with a few lines on his face.  It adds to  his world weary charachters belivability and makes him more human.
Gibson  is bent on revenge after being betrayed by his partner in crime and by his  wife.  The singleminded purpose he goes about exacting his revenge is  handled with crackling pacing.

In spite of serious personal flaws, Gibson's amoral character is disturbingly human.  His  endurance and personal capabilities drive the plot directly to that spot  between your eyes that makes you sit up and say ""What?"".  The  supporting cast spans generations of eclectic acting giants, past and  future:Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and Lucy Liu are the icing that  complete this cake, each bringing that single dimension that most defines  their arresting screen presence.  The violence in this film is intense.  It serves to punctuate the story effectively but may not be everyone's cup  of tea.  That aside, this film is very good.",961113600,,757,5.2

1048443,3,6305480869,"What are the most common fears and frustrations of today's city dwellers?
Your money can be taken from you. A spouse can betray you. The significant other can become addicted to drugs. Someone powerful can insult  you and you'll just swallow - or be squashed like a bug. Alien-looking  people can attack you on a street. A bartender will decide there is no need  to be polite with you. There are some exclusive places you are not allowed  to enter. The police is supposed to protect you but there are renegades in  their ranks that can abuse and blackmail you.  We are all afraid of torture  and death.
Payback is a kind of encyclopedia - the film addresses a wide  range of urban fears.
And you are invited to stand in the shoes of  someone whom you always wanted to be - the fearless adventurer, expert  fistfighter and sharpshooter, a man who can start a 10-minutes walk in a  street as a shabby pauper and finish it smartly dressed, with a new credit  card and a pack of banknotes. He is irresistible to women and deadly to  men. He is not afraid to die - an almost unique quality inherited from  Gibson's Lethal Weapon character.
So he beats everyone (women and  bartenders included), kills quite a few - he is getting even, he pays back,  he is fullfilling your dreams, attending to your fears. Nothing can stop  him.
The film wants to look visually inventive, contemporary.  Mostly it  comes to the blue filter being kept over the camera lenses. Or were the  freshly shot rolls of film soaked in a can of blue ink? Gibson narrates the  story in a way that makes him look like Chandler's Marlowe. And the final  song sends us back to the the films noir tradition.
But all these tricks  fail to amount to anything significant. The violence is excessive, Porter's  stubbornness ( -""$70 000, not $130 000!"") begins to annoy very  quikly and the director's invitation to participate in that feat of  gratification is too obvious.",955324800,3,1931,4.573099415204679

1048507,3,6305480869,"So said the tv spots for this Mel Gibson crime/caper flick.  And make no doubt about it; Mel's a thieving, conniving, murderous thug, but what makes you root for him is his dogged determination to get what is rightfully his.  This film is a throwback to the old gangster dramas, along the  lines of old Cagney films, but it's much more brutal and vicious.  It's  full of great moments, and Mel never once steps out of character making his  performance that much more believable.  Even Kris Kristofferson's good in  it, and that's sayin' somethin'!  Throw in the luscious Lucy Liu and you've  got a good flick.  Still don't think Mel can pull off playing a scumbag?  See this one and be proved wrong.  As James Coburn states in the film,  ""Man, you're just mean!""  My favorite part of the movie is the  first ten minutes, as Mel goes from being bleeding and busted to having a  good suit, a pocket full of money and a credit card, and it's all 'cause  he's a slick S.O.B.

Sheesh, it's like writing a poor review of Lion King because it was  animated.

This is the first film I've seen Gibson portray a character only described as a good-bad guy. This time he  has the upperhand (most of the time) and does a bit of the damage control;  It's always the real bad guys that get that privelage. Without giving away  too much of the film's minor portion of comical slapstick, there is one  scene where Gibson's character Porter is repeatedly slapped in the back of  the head by one of the movie's shadier characters (this is a funny scene,  especially when America remembers a time when Mel was US Magazine's Sexiest  Man Alive in the past). His dead panned expressions and deep serious voice  let the bad guys know he is not kidding around. Lucy Liu, from Ally McBeal  fame, turns in one of the most kinkiest performances without actually using  any nudity ! She adds quite a sensational spark to the movie.  All in all,  from the previous mixed reviews, people should take it for what it is; A  typical action/comedy/drama flick done Mel Gibson style !Mel's antics rate  top 5 stars and the story rates 3 stars. It was also a real hoot to see  some old Hollywood heavyweights: James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, and  William DeVane.

With a cast totally formed by actors who were famous in the  seventies for these kind of pictures(like Kris Kristofferson or James  Coburn), Payback is original, and that is a lot, if we consider the trashes  that Hollywood throw into the theaters nowadays. Better than Gibson's  previous films, Payback is a violent and thrilling ride, shot with a dark,  opressive and dirty photography (what makes it seems like a seventies  crime-drama), characters that don't worth nothing (even the main character  is , in fact, a Humphrey Bogart kind of anti-hero) and a sick plot. Porter  (Gibson) hits and kills people with no significant reasons, and he seems  that he is having a lot of fun. If you are looking for something  interesting, this is a good option, but if you want a typical action flick,  with impressive adventure scenes, stay away: the action in Payback is just  basic, although very cruel and realistic.",944611200,3,1078,4.767567567567568

I do, however like some of the  dialogue in this film, derived straight out of some old classic crime movie  of the 40's or 50's.  At times if you squint at the screen, you may swear  your watching an old balck and white crime classic.
There are too many  dry spots in this film though, and some of the bantering between all the  crimelords is a bit confusing and just plain dull.

The film itself has good pacing  for a pretty barren storyline. It keeps moving forward not so much because  of revelations, but because of the integrity of the character.
