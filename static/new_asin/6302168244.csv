7822106,4,6302168244,"Take a behind the scenes tour of the Back to the Future trilogy. Hosted by Kirk Cameron from Growing Pains fame, this goes deeper into the making of one of the top grossing movie trillogies of all time.
Originaly this tape was an add on to when they first released the Trilogy on tape.  This came as an additional tape with the 3 movies in a boxed set. This was before the days of DVD so this was actualy a big deal. (Now this is on the DVD box set and is on the BTTF3 movie disk as a bonus material).
The tape itself actualy starts off pretty well with Kirk showing up in the DeLorean and arriving in the old west town from part 3. He then answers some random questions that are asked either by the townsfolk around him or by some random letter that is delieverd or that he sorts through.  The reason why I didn't rate this a 5 is that it gets a little cutesy and corny at points. Things get a little silly with the ways that they have voices of a fan asking a question and some of the info they give really more just wets your whistle then tells all. As you will see in the DVD set , they really only do the peek of the mountain when it comes to behind the scenes information on the trillogy. Also had some hidden advertisements for Part 3 and the Back to the Future ride both of which were opening sometime after this was made.
I do recomend this though if you haven't gotten the DVD and don't plan on doing so.  This shows some hidden scenes like the mysterious hairdryer that Marty has on his belt when hes scaring his father. And what happens after old Biff exits the DeLorean in 2015 after returning from the past.  Interseting notes on how they did the train scenes and just some over all interseting shots of the differnet DeLoreans from the 3 movies and secrets on how they did the Hoverboards. Its fun to learn a lot of these little tidbits , just have to sorta stomach some of the stuff from Kirk Cameron and its a great behind the scenes piece.",1045440000,7,1957,4.169312169312169
