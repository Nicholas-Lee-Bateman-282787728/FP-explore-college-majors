8264457,4,B001700N18,"This is an extremely low-budget movie that was probably made with a Mini DV camcorder. The story involves a cursed puppet, Charlie Chowderhead, who was the star of an old black-and-white TV show. He's kept hidden in the closet by his owner, until one day he decides to let him out. The puppet then re-animates and kills his owner, and then he begins to go after another bunch of people. This film does have some problems. First of all, there's no interesting scenery or atmosphere. Around the beginning before the puppet comes to life, I thought it was a little slow. There was some dialogue that takes place indoors; I thought they could've picked up the pace here and some may be bored in these parts. If the movie began with a quicker pace, it would've been a much better film. The lack of good scenery and atmosphere is sometimes a problem because this may cause some to be bored in between the exploitation. The acting was OK for a really cheap DV flick, and the directing may be considered to be OK or bad depending on how many of these amateur type shot-on-video flicks you like to watch. The gore is nothing extreme and the body count is low. You get to see a funny scene when the puppet stabs a fully nude woman in the back of the neck who's sitting on the toilet, and there's a cheap throat slashing with some blood that mostly just spills from her mouth. The puppet gets a couple more people like his owner, but don't expect any good gore; the overall lack of gore in the film was disappointing. As for the nudity, this flick actually delivers. We get a full frontal nude scene with a girl in the tub who I personally thought looked really good; she's really thin and has some sort of an attractive type quality about her. Then there's a fairly explicit sex scene with another girl who then gets killed nude on the toilet; this scene is good for some laughs. We see her fully nude, and the puppet strings up her fully nude body after she's dead. Despite some problems, I gave it four stars because I thought it was a really good effort for something so cheap; the low-budget obviously effected the film. I've watched my DVD a lot because I think it's a fun flick that's easy to follow, but if you're going to buy it, remember it's extremely cheap and has flaws.

Despite the films cheapness, the DVD quality is very good. It's in anamorphic widescreen. There's also a good photo gallery that plays with some strange and fun music around the second half. The menu screen has music and some animation, but the chapter stops just have animation and no sound.",1379116800,,2566,4.459574468085107
