8702453,1,B0009XRZH4,"This movie has graphics & video from the 80's.  The kids are wearing face paint which makes the video seem bizarre and scary.  This was a gift for my nephew, but after 2 mins of staring at it in horror, I turned it off.  This will be going into the trash.",1309824000,,255,3.9607843137254903
8702454,1,B0009XRZH4,This is a very badly shot video of childrens songs set to awful music.  There is no interaction for learning songs or hand motions.  My kids lost interest after about 1 minute of repeative shots of scenery and terrible graphics.  YUCK!,1164326400,3,235,4.682926829268292
