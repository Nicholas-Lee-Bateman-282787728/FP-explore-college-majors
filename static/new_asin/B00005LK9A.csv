7943920,4,B00005LK9A,"I got this DVD for my father, who is a WWII veteran and himself was trained to fly the B-29 and would have served in the Pacific - had the Japanese not surrendered. We watched the DVD together, and overall we both liked it. It had very good period footage of the aircraft during assembly, testing and actual flight. Nearly half of the footage is in color, which was a pleasant surprise. There is a very interesting segment about the construction of the aircraft, which was done by a surprisingly diverse group of people - African Americans, women, teenagers, and even elderly folks were on construction crews. There is a lot of information on the aircraft control systems and pre-flight systems checking procedures, and segments on the island bases the planes were situated at in preparation for the raids on Japan. We had both seen numerous WWII airplane documentaries over the years, but this contained footage we had not seen before, again much of it in color.

On the negative side, we noticed there were no interviews with former pilots or crewmembers, nor any modern film of surviving or restored aircraft; all footage is from the WWII period. Compare this with the Discovery Channel's ""Wings"" series of documentaries, which always had a mix of period footage and comments from the actual people who flew the planes under discussion, and usually showed well-preserved museum examples, or sometimes even planes restored to flying condition. However I do not remember if ""Wings"" ever did a show on the B-29 - if so it has not been available for a long time.

Additionally, this documentary features some decidedly peculiar choices in background music: Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"" and Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" are played in their entirety during long sequences showing the the B-29 taking off and in flight - rather jarring considering the obvious association of both songs with Germany, and especially the Wagner tune as it was arguably the theme song of the Third Reich...

However, even with its shortcomings, this is still an excellent resource for rare films of this terrific war bird, and well worth having in your WWII aircraft  library.",1337817600,,2154,4.941988950276243
