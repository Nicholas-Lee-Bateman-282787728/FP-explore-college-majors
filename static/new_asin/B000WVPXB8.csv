8225786,1,B000WVPXB8,This is just a repackage of her earlier Warrior Goddess workout DVD. I bought it thinking it was a new workout from her. As for the 'extras' it just has her giving you 'first show tips' and a performance by her. Very angry about that. I won't buy her stuff again because of this.,1500336000,,279,4.185185185185185
