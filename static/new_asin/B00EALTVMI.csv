5899731,4,B00EALTVMI,"The die-hard anime fans out there that are either objecting or hesitant about purchasing these feature compilations need to understand that it was the original Japanese studio Toei themselves who had all these TV anime dubbed and compiled into features in the first place. Many of these shows had filler episodes and I believe this feature format is actually the best way to attract these old shows overseas, as you get the real essential elements of each series, while remaining faithful to the essence of the original Japanese series, so they are not sanitized or Americanized in any real way at all. Toei themselves planned out how each series was to be edited for the features. So for all the die-hard anime fans out there, this is really as good as you're going to get. The voice acting in the dubs aren't perfect, but at least, because its Toei themselves putting these out internationally and not a local licensor, you know the scripts never really stray from the original Japanese ones.

As for those who grew up with Danguard Ace on Force Five, I think all the Force Five series have had their rights reverted back to Toei. I don't believe the company that makes them even exists anymore. There's no way they will ever be released officially on DVD. Besides, each of the Force Five series only had 26 episodes produced among them, so they are incomplete with no conclusion, which these features will have. Besides, Toei themselves feel these international feature compilations are superior to the original Force Five dubs.

I would advise all the die-hard purist anime fans out there to read this interview with the person in charge of the company that did all these dubbed feature compilations for Toei. I think he makes an excellent case for the rationale of why Toei went with this approach. It's on the website Sci-Fi Japan and titled ""Classic Anime Gets Star Treatment!""

Besides, the original target age of Danguard Ace and most of the other series Toei are putting out these international dub feature compilations when they first aired on TV in Japan were children. I think this format will be a better way of attracting a few new younger fans outside the anime die-hards, without them being given it in a way that's sanitized or overly Americanized.",1385683200,14,2266,4.805128205128205

5899736,4,B00EALTVMI,"Grew up watching Danguard Ace (Force Five), and I am grateful to finally get to purchase a legal version of the show.  I would have preferred to have the original Japanese audio with subtitles, since they kept the original names of characters.  Blame it on nostalgia, but I have fond memories of Winstar, Captain Mask, Doctor Monocle, and Capt. Stache's Force Five voices, that it was jarring to watch these movies with the inferior new dub.  On the flip side of nostalgia, I was able to press on and enjoy the shows new visuals from episodes not seen on Force Five, and to finally see an ending to Danguard Ace was a god send.  If you want to enjoy a trip down memory lane, or want to see, not a perfect representation but good enough representation of a great show and exciting robot fights, that don't last 3 sec and 1 hit from a ""BLAZING"" sword, check out this DVD.  Here's hoping to a release of a full season set.  You never know, I never thought I would see releases of Mazinger Z, Casshern, Lupin III, or Saint Seiya season sets, but those have finally been released.  Fingers crossed!!!",1403568000,6,1095,4.472361809045226
5899737,3,B00EALTVMI,"If you're like me you rushed home from school every afternoon in the early 80's to watch Force Five and Star Blazers. Danguard Ace was created by Leiji Matsumoto who also brought us Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers), Captain Harlock, Galaxy Express 999, and SF Sayuki Starzinger (Space Keteers.)
I say ""Not Force Five"" because this production was recently done by a different company than that of the one that did Force Five over 30 years ago. So the voices, character names, and source material (episodes) chosen to make this collection are different. What they did here for this collection is take the original 56 TV episodes and condense them into 3 movies totaling 336 minutes.

Pros:
This collection brings the story all the way to the finale. Something the Force Five version did not as mostly generic non-story driven episodes of its original 56 were used for its 26 episode run.
This new version also used the original character names from the original Japanese version. So no ""Winstar, Captain Mask, Kommissar Krell, Dr. Monocle, etc.
The jet mode version of the Danguard robot was called Satelizer and this movie collection preserved that.
Fans who watched Force Five like me over 30 years ago used to wonder what happened to Captain Mask? Well, you do find out with this collection. I found out 14 years ago having purchased the Japanese original TV series on laser disc. YES, laser disc!

Cons:
The voice acting was absolutely horrendous... Dr. Tanuki was saddled with a ridiculous ""ol' prospector from the old west"" voice... In the Force Five version he was known as Prof. Snuff and had a German accent.
This leads to my next con of there being no Japanese voice track with English subtitles.
The deaths of key villains was omitted. Understandable in the condensing of 56 episodes into 336 minutes.  I won't spoil it by listing them.
Where are the extras?? Surely there could have been some extras on the disc that had only one movie on it while the other disc had 2 movies.
They didn't stay true to the series by not calling the Doppler robots ""Mecha-Satans.""
The story of Vice Chancellor Hechi's daughter was omitted. Yes, ""Dr. Monocle"" had a daughter!

This collection is great if you were ever curious of what ever happened to Captain Mask or if the Danguard team ever made it to planet Promete. You'll see plenty of episode footage from the original series that never made the transition to Force Five in 1980.",1400457600,14,2433,4.785714285714286

5899739,5,B00EALTVMI,"I just received Danguard Ace: The Movie Collection.  The Force Five Version is excellent.  It took a bit of getting used to the voices because the ones with Jim Terry Productions were quite different as well as the names of the characters.  The tragedy at the end was a bit different than the Danguard Ace on TV.  But the color and the special effects were superb!  I hope they come out with Force Five's version Danguard Ace.  I'd buy that in a minute too.  Get this movie, it's great!",1398384000,2,486,4.393258426966292
