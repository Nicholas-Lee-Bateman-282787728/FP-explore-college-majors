6264017,5,B00II4S0K2,Loved the first season was looking forward to the new season and they did not disappoint. The main thing I love about this series is the characters! The characters are what make this series stand out from many other anime of today. I thought the first season had gone fairly deep into the characters and I had made a great connection with them. But they go even deeper in this season even tackling the somewhat more minor characters. Of course they still have their fun moments and they never go so deep into the drama that they cant bring you back laughing at how silly it all was after all. I am an even more avid fan after this season and am looking forward to the next season with much anticipation.,1393459200,22,703,4.374045801526718
6264018,5,B00II4S0K2,Ok this is just awesome the first series came out last year and the second season had just finished now we'er getting the second season on bluray in May just awesome I say. I've seen it subbed and let me say it was great third season going to be epic. But I do have one question is this going to have a English audio track? It says dubbed in English but next to language it just says Japanese? Interesting I'm buying it anyways but just though is ask.,1393286400,3,451,4.136363636363637
6264019,5,B00II4S0K2,"I'm gonna say this plain and simple. Best series ever, at least for me, that wanted comedy, drama, a cute love triangle, and mischief. Now we are presented with the 2nd season, hope to get this on a limited edition, as I did for the 1st season.

High hopes for this upcoming release.",1393113600,6,283,4.339622641509434

6264075,3,B00II4S0K2,"Another great season to a great show.

The only thing it loses points for is not being an uncensored release. It was in fact, RE-censored from the original Japanese uncensored version in one episode, nothing you'd really notice, it's a wonder WHY they did it at all even. Aside from that the rest of the show was never intended to have actual nudity like season 1 did.

6264077,3,B00II4S0K2,"As harem anime go Haganai is really in a grey area. It's not great and yet it isn't terrible. The main problem that I have with it is how indecisive the guy of the group is. The female cast are of more interest, but it's pretty much a set of checks and balances with each girl having a counterpart with a different personality than their own.  Still it's a fun slice of life harem show.",1417651200,,386,4.1466666666666665

6264094,1,B00II4S0K2,"I thought that it was important to note, because there has been criminally low coverage of this aspect of this release on the web, that this home video released has been censored.

The Japanese home video release of episode 2 included many redrawn scenes including a shot of the eroge being played that was made to be a lot revealing. Funimation has created a Frankenstein monster version of this sequence by retaining all of the redrawn shots except the redone shot with nudity not in the broadcast version: this video release censors that shot and the nudity in it by replacing it with the broadcast image without nudity.

As far as I'm concerned, this is a failure on the part of Funimation as a firm that puts out anime on home video in the west and is reminiscent of the Saban days of DBZ. In 2014, this product is a failure and should be considered defective.

The fact that none of the anime news blogs or sites reported on this is also a failure of the west's anime journalism because it certainly is an issue.

The fact that this release also renders Funimation's FAQ about censorship on their site a lie is also notable.

If you care about anime at all and want your home releases to remain uncensored, as they should be, then I suggest that you do not purchase this release.",1410566400,10,1285,4.497854077253219

6264108,5,B00II4S0K2,"Well we return to our favorite group of friendless misfits as they try to learn how to make friends, or die trying.  New developments in the relatonships between certain members of the group come to the surface, new plans on how to make friends are put to the test, and a discovery of one cross dressing maid comes to light (though why it took 17 episodes for this to come out is all part of the charm).  But why is Sena and Kozara looking uncomfortable right now, and can the most perverted member bring peace to all involved?

This season takes all from the first and amps it up, you really connect with each one of the members and cheer them on in their never endig pursuit for friendship.  The character development is great and the introduction of new secondary characters do not pull any attention from the story (especially Maria's older sister).  Overall both series was good, and the ending leaves a huge opening for season three (though this goes through volume 8 of the manga- there is more than enough out there for at least 2 more seasons).  Grab this and enjoy.",1403222400,6,1075,4.515463917525773

The comedy is great, the art is breathtaking, and the characters are very easy to relate to and lovable. I Love Sena!!

6264121,5,B00II4S0K2,"Loved the first season and was delighted to see the characters continue to expand on their absurdity. Rika even got crazier this time around and made a stronger showing. Whereas the first season ended as a complete set, this season ends on a bit of a cliff hangar that just begs for a continuation, and I sure hope it comes.",1402185600,6,324,4.416666666666667
6264122,4,B00II4S0K2,"This is either the censored version, or unlike season 1, there was no nudity in season 2.  There is still some minor fan service and a few suggestive scenes so I would hesitate to recommend this series to younger viewers.  This title is listed as ""unrated"" on Amazon but could be suitable for ages 15+.

The same characters are back with a few new characters who briefly show up.  Maria has an older sister and you get to meet the student council members.  The show still centers around the neighbors club, playing video games, and the interactions between each of the members.  While the show is still light hearted, amusing, and funny.... it does start to get stale.  By the end it seems that the plot lines are starting to get ""old"" and there isn't much further character development.

I enjoyed the series up until this point but I do not think the writers can generate enough new material from the characters in the neighbors club, to make a season 3.",1401408000,5,956,4.549707602339181

6264125,5,B00II4S0K2,"Last time on Haganai... a group of quirky high school students establish the Neighbor's Club that's sole purpose is to help its club members learn how to make friends, but their cluelessness on how to make friends is not their biggest problem... their real problem is their idiosyncrasies and insecurities.

The misadventures continue... Kodaka, Sena, Yozora and the rest of the Neighbor's Club are back and once again their misguided efforts to learn how to make friends are hampered by their quirkiness. This time around tensions will reach their boiling point due to internal club conflicts and external school influences. When all is said and done will the club survive?

While the characters continue to be both aggravating and endearing thankfully they also continue to be hilarious and entertaining. The addition of profanity felt a little out of place to me and seemed like it was added simply to make the show more edgy.

The animation is top notch, the characters are compelling, the story is both hilarious and intriguing with an excellent English dub making this series a must own for any anime fan and one of my favorite animes!

6264128,3,B00II4S0K2,"Finding it better to have at least watched a version of this release before commenting on it instead of wishful thinking, this review is of the long-available censored version from that ""other"" market, and the series was found, sadly, wanting...very wanting. As an early reviewer that raved about the first season only to find the complete and uncensored version not up to anticipated standards regarding child  and underage nudity. This series, Season 2, continues the decline into ""the Agenda' abbess. There is much, however, to recommend this well-drawn and fast-paced series. It will be difficult but not impossible to keep spoilers out.
Yozora and Sena remain at each other's throats, often to the point of obsession worthy of intervention.
Kodaka and Sena have a relationship set by their fathers that neither of the teenagers were aware of; if you thought Yozora and Sena were at odds before that revelation, you seen nothing yet.
Maria has an older sister, also a ""sister"",15 years old, dresses in a ""mini-habit"" and is a belching potty-mouth, just as Maria. Their relationship is an intense ""typical "" sister against sister relationship.
Kobato finds she has a following in her school after her performance at their cultural festival; someone on the series production staff, however, still has an unexplainable obsession with baring her crotch, just as they did in season one.
Yukimura, the wanna'be male that Yozora has been having fun with by making ""him"" dress in female clothes...hummm...well,while the whole club goes to an amusement park for the day, after a ""mishap"" requiring a bath in the public bath, Maria decides she must bath with the males, strips down and, once in the bath, points to Kodaka's ""junk"" and ask, ""What's  that used for?""...what else does one expect from a ten-year-old female bathing with a teen-aged male not her relation in a public bath...then she comments about Yukimura's ""construction while ""he""...maybe...is washing Kodaka's back.
Rika wants to upgrade her looks. She is also a certifiable sexual deviant and continues her obsession with male homo-erotica by both introducing a dating sym game where the only one-on-one action in this series is between two males and the reading of a erotica books that uses language I will not repeat; Rica could have been written out of the series and the series would not have suffered.
The truth about Maria's true status as a nun is reveled and the ending of the series indicated another season is needed to complete the story.
While I will eventually buy this series, it isn't a priority only because of the descent into further sexual degradation of both Maria,a 10 year old, and 14 year old Kobato. There simply is no need for it and, as such, 3 stars is generous.",1396569600,5,2750,4.989106753812636

8642160,5,B00II4S0K2,"- Synopsis: The whacky adventures and interactions continue in this sequel. The main gist of this anime showcases the life of various club members that created a club just to make friends. As such, the club doesn't do anything amazing or productive, but shows relatable interactions loaded with dialogue and silliness. Tune in to see how each character's development and relationships change in this funny, whacky, and silly anime.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This is a comedy and ecchi. As such, it is going to be fan-service-heavy. If you've seen the first series, this shouldn't be a surprise. Aside from that, a lot of the character interactions are silly and funny. The club activities just entail them hanging out. Nothing too productive. This anime is also dialogue-heavy and doesn't have any action. Plenty of drama, as well. Keep this in mind if those things matter to you.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Comes with12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs. Run-time is about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA mainly for fan-service.

- Conclusion: A silly and simplistic anime to enjoy. Plenty of social interactions between the characters as some of them mess with each other. There's moderate fan-service. Dramatic and dialogue-heavy with comedy and cute girls that adds to our misunderstood protagonists' harem.
