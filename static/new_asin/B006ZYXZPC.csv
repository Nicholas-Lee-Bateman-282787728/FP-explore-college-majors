Lol I saw ""the green light"" part completely because I was too scared to move so I couldn't get the coat over my eyes! I've told the stories from this movie around campfires every since! Moss Point Man! I wish it was on blue ray or DVD. I has no vhs player. :(",1456444800,,395,3.95
8507350,5,B006ZYXZPC,One of the scariest films this horror fan has ever seen. I saw it in the theater when I was 14. It was spooky then and I'm always looking for it hoping to someday find it offered up in a classic horror set. It was scary because back in the day people actually got together face to face (Skypeing doesn't count) and entertained each other by scaring the crap out of your friends in wilderness. Because everything is always scarier when you have no phone to call 911. I asked one of my friends children if they were going to tell ghost stories at their sleep over. They looked at me as if I had just spoken a forgiven language. I realized that these days they just pop in a DVD-no storytelling needed. Anyways Screams of a Winters Night captures the awesomeness of storytelling of old.,1428624000,,783,4.36986301369863
8507351,4,B006ZYXZPC,"SCREAMS OF A WINTER NIGHT is a horror anthology film from 1979. A group of ten friends (5 guys, 5 gals) head out to the hinterlands to stay in some abandoned cabins. Ignoring the ominous, oddball denizens of the nearby town, they set out for their holiday destination. Upon arrival, they snoop around, and settle in. Once night falls, the stories begin. Story #1 (MOSS POINT MAN)- A young couple driving on a desolate road, runs out of gas. The boyfriend heads out w/ his trusty gas can, leaving the girl in the car. Terror ensues. This one's based on the oft-told urban legend about the ""mysterious scraping on the car roof"". Story #2 (THE GREEN LIGHT)- Three frat pledges must spend the night in a supposedly haunted hotel. They're told not to venture above the first floor. Strange noises are heard from upstairs. Obviously, the pledges must investigate. Spookiness occurs. This one's rather tedious, w/ a minimal payoff. It does get an A+ for atmosphere though! Story #3 (CRAZY ANNIE)- After a bad date experience, resulting in a near rape and a definite death, Annie loses her mind, soon embarking on a murderous rampage. This segment has the only real blood-letting of the three. Annie's facial expression during the final killing is perfection made flesh! The wrap-around tale is actually more effective than the three main stories. The finale contains supernatural eeevil, and the sort of creepiness lacking in most of the rest. Worth a watch or two. Rated PG, so even granny might like it!...",1407715200,2,1501,4.844357976653696
8507352,5,B006ZYXZPC,"Best horror movie of all time! Hard to find but worth it. College students spend a weekend at a cottage in LA, and tell each other scary stories, and their reality is  more scary. Very little gore.",1383782400,,197,4.324324324324325
