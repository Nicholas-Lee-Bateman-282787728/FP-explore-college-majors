If you're a fan of the Dragnet and Adam-12 TV series of the 1960's and '70s, the Dragnet radio shows of the 1950's are even better, and old time radio drama is engrossing in a different way then TV and the movies. Included on two disks are more than 300 episodes of the original series. They download easily onto Window Media player for listening on your computer. From there they can be downloaded to your MP3 player, Blackberry or burned to a CD. The quality and value are excellent.",1278806400,,534,4.404040404040404
8305331,5,B001GGLZQA,I love the old Dragnet radio shows with Jack Webb. The audio is generally good and certainly as good as can be expected for the age of the original recordings. Dragnet won a lot of awards during its radio days. You will love this if you enjoy old radio shows.,1264464000,,259,4.2
