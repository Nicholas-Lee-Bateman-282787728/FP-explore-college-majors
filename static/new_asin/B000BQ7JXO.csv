2437836,4,B000BQ7JXO,"A wonderfully quiet, almost meditative, look at a man's life and that of his father. Film is complemented by a gentle piano score from Ryuichi Sakamoto and totally original photographic compositions from cinematographer Taishi Hirokawa.

Film opens with a somewhat long montage (with stills and narration) of Tony's early years with his father. Left alone most of the time Tony develops a passion for drawing which leads to his career as an illustrator. It is only as a middle-aged man that he meets the perfect woman, though her one 'fatal' flaw is an addiction to shopping which provides a good deal of humor to the somewhat sad, isolated story of Tony's life.

Can't say more without spoiling the plot, but if you treasure personal films without explosions, car chases, and profanity then this is your movie for the summer!",1138492800,5,826,4.9352517985611515
2437837,3,B000BQ7JXO,"Director Jun Ichikawa demonstrates a uniquely idiosyncratic filmmaking style somewhat reminiscent of Yasujiro Ozu's work in his constant use of lengthy medium shots shot at waist level, as well as a certain narrative sensibility that focuses on elliptical episodes to unfold a story in a subtly uneventful manner. Unlike Ozu, however, Ichikawa verges somewhat toward contrivance in unspooling his tale, one that feels more like a paean to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". However, the Freudian subtext and Baroque melodrama of that classic have been submerged in favor of glacial pacing and implied emotionalism.

The title character with the staccato name is the only son of a renowned jazz trombonist. He grows up to become a lonely technical illustrator who obsesses over his work and remains content in his solitude. He finally meets Eiko, a beautiful, demure woman with an even greater obsession - an uncontrollable desire for designer clothes. Upon his insistence, they marry and live happily for a time, so much so that he realizes he can never live without her. True to Murphy's law, tragedy strikes, and the plot turns on what Tony does next to fill the void in his existence. Based on a short story by popular writer Haruki Murakami (who wrote the intriguingly surreal ""Kafka on the Shore"" released last year in the US), the 2005 movie effectively captures the author's highly stylized world, in particular, Tony's solitude in a series of lingering silences and mundane activities punctuated by acts of quirky behavior.

The beautifully muted cinematography is by Taishi Hirokawa, and it reminds me of Gordon Willis's work on Woody Allen's ""Interiors"". Similar to the Bergmaneque feeling of that film, Hirokawa achieves a consistent aesthetic that matches an art design that sees characters occupying clean white and grey spaces rendered with a soft graininess. Moreover, the camera moves gradually though pointedly from left to right as transitional devices to move the story's action forward as if following a horizontal timeline or looking though a series of slides. The technique is intriguing at first but eventually feels contrived, just like the literary conceit of having the characters finish the narrator's sentences (Hidetoshi Nishijima provides the penetrating voice narration throughout the story). There is also a meditative, Windham Hill-esque music score by the estimable Ryuichi Sakamoto, which aptly captures the evocative nature of the story structure.

The acting is unobtrusive to fit the mostly quiet atmosphere. In true Hitchcockian fashion, Ichikawa has his two leads play double roles - Issei Ogata plays Tony and his jazz musician father, and Rie Miyazawa plays Eiko and Hisako, the woman who responds to Tony's ad. Truthfully, neither makes that vivid an impression in either role, and that is part of the problem I have with the film, the lack of indelible characters to inhabit the hermetically sealed world that Ichikawa and Murakami have created. The paper-thin plot yields very little opportunity for emotional payoffs, and there is little that remains resonant after all is said and done. Even at a brief 75-minute running time, it feels like slow going and lingers with a vague sense of hopelessness. By the way, the DVD has no significant extras.",1137456000,4,3288,5.247148288973384
2437838,5,B000BQ7JXO,"This film, minimalist in the best possible sense, is a lyrical study of isolation and loss. Tony Takitani (Issei Ogata) grows up the loner kid of a jazz-playing, loner father. Like his father, Tony masters an art, drawing, and eventually becomes very successful. Early in his adulthood Tony has a few failed romances but never considers marriage until, in middle age, he meets a woman fifteen years his junior, the sight of whom for the first time adds an unshakable pain to his profound solitude.

A long sequence of aged Japanese photographs acts as a prelude to the film, telling in a few minutes the story of Tony's father. This section of plot takes up a much greater portion of Haruki Murakami's original short story, and Jun Ichikawa made a wise decision in reducing it, though utmost respect for the source material is in evidence throughout the film.

And then Tony's story itself begins, and if you are going to fall for this film, you do it then. From start to finish, really, the film is an episodic accumulation of small, deeply-touching scenes tied together by very simple yet evocative piano music and the enchanting voice of a narrator (Hidetoshi Nishijima) whose warm, thoughtful delivery makes one think of some poet of a bygone era.

Tony's courtship of Eiko and his subsequent troubles draw us closer and closer to this sad, beautiful soul until his loneliness finally becomes absolute. Ichikawa solidifies these intense layers of feeling with wonderfully basic techniques: stirring skylines and skyscapes used as backdrops; lovely, tangible environments; and discrete, minimalist camera angles--key conversations shot from behind the characters, over the shoulder, for instance. As a side note, the one film to which I can compare ""Tony Takitani"" is Laurent Cantet's ""L'emploi du temps"" (France, 2001), which has a similarly touching minimalism married to the intense inner lives of characters.

I was fortunate enough to see ""Tony Takitani"" at the 2005 Seattle International Film Festival, and of the films I have seen at the festival over the past decade, this ranks among my favorite three--the others being the 1996 Israeli film ""Clara Hakedosha"" (""Saint Clara"") and 1999's ""A la medianoche y media"" (""At Midnight and a Half"") from South America. I cannot imagine a better feature film to first bring the brilliant writing of Haruki Murakami to the big screen.

Note: Murakami's ""Tony Takitani"" was first published in English in the April 15, 2002 issue of The New Yorker.",1131926400,18,2497,5.065693430656935
2437839,4,B000BQ7JXO,"A distant hommage to Hitchcock's Vertigo, this movie is about solitude and destiny. The sweeping camera makes you think you're exploring a beautiful japanese parchment. This movie is an old master's work, and every picture confirms his mature talent. And it's funny, too!
Seeing it on DVD for the second time, I found it less appealing than the first time. Be sure to drink a lot of coffee before pressing PLAY.",1131753600,5,411,4.802816901408451
2437840,3,B000BQ7JXO,"In the film ""Tony Takitani,"" director Jun Ichikawa gives the viewer a sense of isolation and loneliness that one does not find with too many other directors. I have not read the short story that the film is based on, but one does not need to. With a third person narrative, and a minimal use of the actors' interaction, the film makes you feel very lonely. Which I am sure is exactly what the director was aiming for. The cinematography is beautiful, and at the same time, compliments the film, as Ichikawa's use of the camera gives you a feeling of the same loneliness that the protagonist, Tony Takitani (Issey Ogata) is going through. In fact, Tony Takitani wears his loneliness on his face. And every shot of him in the film is permeated with a sense of loneliness. You can sense it, and feel it.

I really liked the beginning of the film, where we see Tony Takitani's father, (also portrayed by Ogata) lying in a prison cell. The war has just come to an end, and the isolation of being imprisoned, alone and without the contact of others, is a great introduction to the film. As it is this films opening scene that gives the viewer a prelude to what the films main protagonist feels: A sense of isolation and loneliness. The third person narrative also works well by incorporating a dialogue between the viewer and the film, where we are further removed from the films protagonist--as we sense his self-isolation from those around him. This in turn, gives the film an even greater sense of loneliness: The very sense of isolation and being cut off from others that Tony Takitani himself feels.

The film is slow paced, and is only 75 minutes long. Tony Takitani is an illustrator who has always been alone. However, he meets a woman who will change his life. And although Tony is alone most of the time, it is due to his wife that he must now travel and go out to dinner. Not to mention the shopping with her. The films narrator even relates how they have gone to Europe, where she has purchased some of her clothes. So in one sense, although we are not privy to this, we know that Tony has gone places. His wife Eiko (Rie Miyazawa) is a compulsive shopper who desires the the best in fashion. But, as in life, there will be moments of tragedy. The film while slow and quiet, was worth the purchase to me. Sometimes these kind of films are needed. However, it will not appeal to some viewers, therefore, I recommend you rent it first, as it is not a film for everyone. [Stars: 3.5]",1190505600,4,2486,4.461538461538462

The story is flawed. (But who am I to pass such judgment? This movie will be remembered.)
It will be remembered (aside from the remarkable cinematography) because the viewer feels the loneliness, the temporary joy, and the loss central to this movie.",1190160000,5,328,4.875
2437842,4,B000BQ7JXO,"There's no denying the superb visual style of this film.  A lot of people will fall in love with it for that, alone.

We are shown a very lonely boy whose mother died shortly after his birth and whose father was away most of the time, who adapts to life by isolating himself.  He said that he did not realize that he was lonely.  Then nature intervenes and he finally falls in love with a woman who agrees to marry him.  He is supremely happy, but in the back of his mind, he is afraid that one day his loneliness will return.  And, sure enough, it does, maybe because of his own actions, maybe not.

That's pretty much it....lonely boy grows up to be a lonely man.  If you want more than that to a plot, you'll be disappointed.  It is meticulously told and one hopes for some sort of happy ending for this man, but we're not given much to bank on.

I give it four stars for the exquisite artfulness of it, but hold back because the whole thing left me feeling incomplete and empty.  Maybe that was the point---to leave us feeling as empty as the characters were. If so, the film succeeded.  Enjoyable?  Naw!",1182211200,2,1108,4.269230769230769
2437843,3,B000BQ7JXO,I don't understand the reviews for this movie.  I didn't read the book but I didn't get the same impression from this film as any others.  I'm not sure if I am more disappointed in the story because I don't agree with the perspective or because I don't agree with the interpretation of other viewers.  I did laugh at Rie Miyazawa's last scene when she didn't even want free latex gloves.  That was great.  Hopeful.  I certainly enjoyed her scenes.  But I wanted to see this movie shot again and retold.  I understand that this movie is the way it is intentionally but it seems that the deep analyses of this film are not all that deep.  Is there a hidden message in this film because the background is war-based and this film embodies and is about and practices circumvented emotion? Is this film actually a litmus test?,1176422400,4,820,4.486486486486487
2437844,3,B000BQ7JXO,"For everything I liked about ""Tony Takitani"", there is something about the film I disliked. In the end, I'm glad I saw the Japanese film on DVD, but if I had paid to see it at a theater, I wouldn't have been as happy. It takes the right type of person to appreciate this film and I don't know many of those people.

Tony Takitani (Issei Ogata), the son of a Jazz musician (also played by Ogata), grows up living a solitary life. From an early age, he learns to care for himself while his Dad is away, touring the far corners of the globe for months, years on end. Tony learns he has the ability to draw, but prefers to be very methodical and precise, so he becomes a mechanical illustrator. A darn good one at that, because he earns a good living. But as an adult, his life is empty; he sees his Dad every two or three years and has no one else in his life, focusing his attention on his work. One day, he meets a young woman, Konuma (Rie Miyazawa) and becomes enamored of her. Despite her objections, they fall in love and marry. But will Tony be happy after all?

Because Tony says little, the film is narrated, providing a sort of guiding poem to Tony's life, giving us occasional clues to his thoughts and feelings. As his world grows, with the addition of a wife, a housekeeper, others, they occasionally finish the narrator's sentences. This is an interesting idea, a partially successful, interesting idea. The narration paints a portrait of Tony's isolation, of his loneliness. Because he rarely speaks, we need a window into his world and the narrator provides that. Every time the narrator returns, we are reminded of this, giving us further evidence of the main character's life.

The narration helps to lend the film a fable quality. We hear ""Tony began to cook his dinners for himself at an early age."" for instance, as we watch scenes play out. Because someone is describing Tony's life, no matter the obtuse, somewhat poetic descriptions sometimes used, it makes us feel as though we are watching a picture book come to life. This, and the sad, rather unusual nature of his life, helps to make the film seem a little more unusual.

""Tony"" has an interesting, visual style. A partially successful, interesting visual style. A majority of the scenes begin with the camera slowly moving across the horizon, from left to right. As the camera moves, we pick up a character and their actions until the camera moves beyond and picks up the next scene, moving from left to right. This technique helps the film seem more fluid, because the camera is always moving. Without this movement, ""Tony"" would feel very episodic. This camera work also creates a sort of visual poem complimenting the Japanese setting and time.

Unfortunately, the combination of the narration and the slow camera sweeping across every scene serve to make the film seem long. At roughly seventy-five minutes, ""Tony"" barely qualifies as a feature length movie. Yet, because of these two techniques, it feels as though we are watching an epic length film without any of the `epic'.

The performances are universally one note but even this sort of fits, no matter how annoying it might be. Because the camera is always moving, it rarely lingers on a scene for long. Essentially, we are watching a series of narrated tableaus illustrating the man's life. Interesting, but not entirely successful either. It would seem unnatural if any character showed a lot of emotion because we are only watching them for a brief period. But staying true to the filmmaker's ideas has created a very unnatural, slow paced film.

A watchable, but nonetheless unnatural and slow paced film.",1169683200,8,3647,4.706896551724138
2437845,5,B000BQ7JXO,"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

-John Donne, Meditation XVII

Thanks to our local Arts Center, we were privileged to enjoy four thought-provoking foreign films this season.  Each was extraordinarily good in its own way, yet it is TONY TAKITANI that remains strongest in memory. Set apart from the rest of his world by a foreign name, Tony would express his soul through art, but, ironically, his artistic precision is too exact, depicting reality with exceptional precision but thereby lacking in the symbolism and interpretation required of an artist, and he becomes a technical illustrator instead.

While his business is successful, it is a sterile profession that does nothing to link him to the rest of humanity.  Tony is truly alone, separate, apart, an island in the human sea.  It is a condition that he never desired, nor, I think, does he understand how it came to be, but his awareness of his ""apartness"" makes his social isolation even more painful.

Is there any succor for Tony?  Any avenue through which he might be able to join with his fellow man, to leave his island of isolation behind, to feel fulfilled and accepted by others in a way that is meaningful and significant, something more than the sterile ""success"" of being an unfeeling illustrator?  (Tony, of course, certainly feels; it is his profession that provides no outlet for feeling.)  Indeed, Eiko enters his life when she comes as a customer but becomes his lover and his wife.

Yet, as all humans, Eiko has weaknesses.  Hers is shopping and an inordinate love of clothing.  After converting a goodly part of their apartment into a huge closet for Eiko's vast collection of clothing, Tony must finally urge her to control her obsession.  For love of her husband and obedience to him, Eiko begins to return some of her recent purchases to the stores, yet weakens as she drives home and, turning around to reclaim a piece that she has just returned, is killed in a traffic accident.

Tony's utter devastation is undoubtedly amplified by the knowledge that it was his own admonition that ultimately resulted in the death of the one link he had ever established with humanity.  He makes one pathetic attempt to pretend that the link can exist again by employing a young woman ostensibly as a secretary but in reality to play the role of Eiko by dressing in her clothes. As quickly as he does this, though, he realizes the futility of such a fiction and dismisses the woman.  Alone once again in the now-empty closet that once held his wife's clothing, he lies on the floor, overcome by loneliness and isolation, conditions which have trapped him as surely as the prison cell that had contained his father years before.

Tony Takitani is the personification of the antithesis of the connectedness expressed in Donne's oft-quoted ""Meditation.""  As John Donne proclaims all life to be interconnected and avows that the death of one diminishes the lives of all others, Tony Takitani shows us the separateness, the isolation, and the acrid taste of not belonging.  It is of Tony that Simon and Garfunkle have sung, with bitter irony:

I touch no one and no one touches me.

I am a rock,

I am an island.

And a rock feels no pain;

And an island never cries.

The motion picture is a powerful commentary on social isolation and on suffering as it is expressed in one individual's emotional agony.  I recommend it most highly to all who give an occasional thought to humanity.",1162166400,3,3804,4.672672672672673
2437846,4,B000BQ7JXO,"I go back and forth about how I feel about movies like Tony Takitani.  There is a palpable emotional impact here, and why shouldn't there be?  The images of Japan are stately in their DV solemnity, and whenever the images are speaking for the film, they work - heads bobbing up hillsides, rooms full of clothes then vacant, two connected images of lying in a cell.  These are images of power, but they're rarely let to speak for themselves - instead, Hidetoshi Nishijima's narration inserts the Haruki Murakami story for which Tony Takitani is based like an uncomfortable apparatus.  Uncomfortable not because it's unwelcome, but because it begins to feel like the movie didn't do much in the process of adaptation - it winds up giving you a very nicely illustrated Haruki Murakami story, an effect which always leaves you questioning the movie's need to exist.  Now, I'm a Murakami fan, and I find this movie's notion of casting its two leads in dual roles to be especially symbolic for the story being told, but it ultimately creates a movie of feeling in which it must be said that the adaptation is lazy.",1155081600,2,1108,4.72020725388601
2437847,3,B000BQ7JXO,"***1/2

Tony Takitani is a shy, introverted middle aged man seemingly destined to live a life of loneliness - until, that is, he meets and falls in love with a sweet and beautiful woman with a strange and insatiable obsession for fashionable clothes.  After a few months of wedded bliss, tragedy strikes the couple and Tony is once again plunged back into a life of melancholic loneliness and grief.  The film, written and directed by Jun Ichikawa, is based on a short story by Haruki Murakami.

""Tony Takitani"" is an odd little Japanese film that, in form as well as in content, sticks very closely to those short story roots.  I would say that a good 60% of the tale is conveyed through voiceover narration rather than dialogue between the main characters.  The drama is so stripped down, spare and simple that it is easy to miss the broader theme that permeates the film.  For this is clearly a movie about the power of obsession (both on the part of Tony and on the part of his wife), but it is all done in so deliberately low-keyed a manner that the film - unlike so many others on the topic - never overstates its message.  And the performances by Issei Ogata, Rie Miyazawa (in a dual role), and Yumi Endo are equally low-keyed, subtle and understated.  The movie's extremely slow pace, far from alienating or boring us, actually pulls us into the strange, virtually wordless drama that is unfolding before us.  Even though it runs a mere 75 minutes in length, ""Tony Takitani"" feels well-rounded and complete, as it casts a hypnotic spell over its audience.  Give it a chance.",1154736000,3,1582,4.614285714285714
2437848,4,B000BQ7JXO,"I understand now! Tony forgot all the things that caused all his pain (at least he tried), yet he could not forget Hisako and her empathetic feelings about his wife. I think that's the reason he calls her in the final scene, perhaps Tony is thinking about a new beginning with Hisako. I came to understand that, Tony trying to replace his wife and somehow recreate her presence was him just fooling himself and I thought it was emotionally unhealthy. That seems to be the idea being relayed here, in a very ambiguous sort of way, not to be physically alone but to be emotionally lonely is unhealthy. This idea has been explored in films/books before.

The scene where Tony falls asleep on the floor of his wife's old closet, was transposed with a scene of his father sleeping on the prison floor from the beginning of the film, maybe that's some kind of metaphor of how loneliness can be a prison, how we create our own prisons. The director just kinda leaves the story hanging, not in the sense that it felt incomplete, it just does not deliver the ever-so coveted ""happy ending"", but it does leave a glimmer of hope in the fact that Tony has taken initiate and attempted to call Hisako, I thought that was brilliant and it leaves one to contemplate how we make our own choices and suggests the idea that it's in our control to obtain happiness.

The cinematography was interesting also, it gave a us a very restricted view of the characters world nevertheless we see just what we need to see. The slow panning shots got boring after awhile but it does not take away anything from this beautiful film.",1154649600,,1602,4.539792387543253

Every inch of the film is beautiful- the cinematography, score and writing are extraordinary. It's very literary, poetic and powerful. I was so moved that when I left the theater I was talking to my boyfriend about a scene from the film and I started weeping.

8091113,4,B000BQ7JXO,"Tony Takitani is a subtle cliff-hanger intended for the patient viewer. This melancholy drama inches along, yet sustains a sense of anguish and apprehension for much of its duration. It has an intimate voyeur-like feel likely to gently envelop its viewers. Despite the film's slow pace, one can't help but surrender to the characters' emotions and its elegant visuals. The camera shots are breathtaking: soft rain in the evening paired with blurred city lights, the play of light and shadow upon the walls, and stark, spare interiors bathed in gloriously golden sunlight. Cinematographically beautiful scenes like these accompanied by a minimalist piano score are what truly gives this film an extra-special touch.

In main character Tony Takitani, many of us can identify with what seems to be his most troubling fear: the fear of being alone. He becomes a character we feel for, and empathize with. We want him to find what he's been searching for: companionship, emotional security, real love.....Is he capable of making that connection?",1448150400,,1040,5.227544910179641

8091115,5,B000BQ7JXO,"Tony Takitani (TT) is a particularly deep reflection of the Japanese pronounced tendency to introversion and loneliness. I strongly relate to those traits and therefore feel the need to write a review because it seems this production has been badly misunderstood here in the USA, quite normal situation since our culture, media and -worse of all- people themselves worship the opposite: extroversion, even when plenty of Americans are introverted, perhaps more than 50%!

  TT's misunderstanding has gone as far as getting it compared to Vertigo. Vertigo certainly had a loneliness and tragedy character After this similitude Vertigo drifts away from our normal and mundane world, a though challenge for filmmakers to tackle (let alone the public). TT, instead, moves toward it, specifically TT's, a person in conformity with his life, enjoying a simple but productive life by profiting from his talent in art by industrious means. Sure, his gift wasn't mundane, cut the makers some slack.

That comfort comes to an end after his successive interactions with people eventually lead to develop one relation that ends up in marriage to Eiko, a marriage that both blesses and curses his life. His life gets complicated, yet, he wants to stays in, the mere thought of losing his wife terrifies him at the beginning. Eiko doesn't belittle him for his fears; in fact all of this becomes a virtuous cycle or self-reinforcing relation. But once TT calms down, Eiko shows more and more of her flaws, like any human.

The movie's story writer -Haruki Murakami- chose Eiko's flaw to be addicted to buying fashion clothes, a classy touch, fit for the movie. Nonetheless it becomes as troublesome as any other addiction (like gambling, drugs, risk taking, etc.) The origin of that flaw seemed to be her way to cope with her inconformity with simple life and/or incapacity to engage in meaningful activities or hobbies to give purpose to her life; anything can be speculated here. At least Eiko's addiction was more understandable in the movie than in the original story that mentions that TT and she did have conversations, large ones, meaning: communication. Besides, the original story displays the Japanese dream of seducing women out of kindness: TT's father, Shozaburo, used to get sex out his niceness. Getting sex out of niceness seems disturbing in the West, but it's often approached in Japanese culture, a great recent example is ""Ristorante Paradiso"" anime. TT, in particular, was better off without it.

  This movie feels indeed like a visual poem, especially by the melancholic background music and with most of the talk coming from a distant narrator. But you will only feel that after you cleanse yourself from the debris that the Western (mostly American) productions have piled up in your mind over your lifetime. Thus, TT is definitively not for everyone, Japanese included as one review showed it. Yes, I am aware that plenty of Japanese can be as vulgar and/or extroverted as anybody else in the world. I myself would've dumped this movie in other times. It was only after a while of watching more and more Japanese productions (with characters that I could relate to) and learning about them and their culture I was able to honestly enjoy it by the time I watched it.",1360886400,3,3276,5.009191176470588
8091116,2,B000BQ7JXO,"I feel a little bad about giving this movie only two stars, because I appreciate its serious intentions. On the other hand, I honestly think that Tony Takitani pales next to the best domestic dramas of cinema - especially the classic Japanese films of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.

In essence, this is a movie above love, loneliness, and obsession. Consequently, it has a slow, meditative pace - which doesn't bother me much. More problematic, to me, is the relatively poor development of the character relationships. For example, we're repeatedly told that Tony is madly in love with his wife, but their personal dynamic comes across as flat on screen, and they seem to have nothing in common. Worse yet, Tony's wife is defined almost exclusively by her obsession with buying and hoarding lots of clothes. How am I really supposed to get to know, or like, a character who does nothing but buy stuff?

Another problem with the film is that it adapts Haruki Murakami's short story in a very straightforward, un-cinematic fashion; indeed, there's a constant voiceover narration that borrows whole chunks of Murakami's original text, which I think is a mistake. Most successful film adaptations of literature chuck out the author's prose and try to create the same effect with visuals alone, which is a better approach, more suited to the particular strengths of cinema. So, given the choice, I'd rather read Murakami's original story than watch this overly direct translation to screen.

That said, Tony Takitani is hardly Murakami's best work. I do think he's one of the best modern writers, but at his weakest, he gets mired in ""woe-is-me"" stories about (self-inflicted?) loneliness, of which this is a prime example. Honestly, I'd much rather see a movie adaptation of one of Murakami's real classics ... something involving talking cats, presumably.

As a final, maybe pointless note - isn't it a little strange that a movie about a woman's obsession with fashion contains almost no lingering, or interesting, shots of clothes...? Seems like an odd omission.",1320105600,2,2056,5.038235294117647

the lead character Tony Takitani got an american name from his jazz obsessed father - where even his family name comes last - in the western style - but none of that has anything to do with the plot

the plot is a love story - between tony - a middle aged man - and a slightly younger woman - a woman obsessed with clothes - much more than usual

of the plot - i'll say no more

this movie has a style - call it ""minimalist""

depleted color - grainy photography - much slow panning - stark yet striking visuals -  tinkling piano - droning voiceover doing most of the talking

8091120,5,B000BQ7JXO,"""Deliberate"" is the word that first springs to mind.  Every single action in ""Toni Takitani,"" every movement of the camera, every homage, is deliberate.  There are no mistakes here, no improvisations, and no wasted moments.  A short film, only 75 minutes, director Ichikawa Jun has made sure that he has absolute control over every second of screen time, and so he tells his tale of loneliness.

Adapted from a short story by Murakami Haruki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-Up-Bird-Chronicle-A-Novel/dp/0679775439/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel</a>), Toni Takitani is a lonely man who doesn't realize he is lonely.  Brought up by a distant father, he learned from a young age to live an isolated life, like a monk is a distant hermitage. He is self-contained.  Until one day, a quiet young girl, fifteen years his junior, comes into his life and fills the emptiness he never knew was there.  For the first time in his life, he knows happiness, as well as the fear of that happiness being taken away.

This story is old school Japanese storytelling.  One can see echoes here from Soseki`s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kokoro/dp/0486451399/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kokoro</a>&nbsp;and Kawabata's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-Country/dp/0679761047/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow Country</a>.  A quiet piece with almost no dialog, much of the story plays out in the unspoken, in the silence between notes.  Director Ichikawa has intentionally blended modern camera work with Ozu's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>) classic ""tatami-mat level camera"" which was thought to capture the ""Japanese eye.""  He also makes heavy use of the trope of the benshi, the narrator.  When film first came to Japan, there were no translations or subtitles so a narrator would stand by the screen and interpret the film for the audience.  Many older directors, such as Ozu and Kurosawa Akira, grew up on this style of film-watching and incorporated it into their own works.

The actors also do an outstanding job in ""Toni Takitani"".  Ogata Issei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sun/dp/B000WQVUKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sun</a>) takes on the dual-role of both Toni Takitani and his jazz-musician father Takitani Shozaburo.  So complete was his transformation that I did not realize this was the same actor until the credits had rolled.  Miyazawa Rie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Samurai/dp/B00065GX0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Samurai</a>) is equally perfect in the dual roles of Konuma Eiko, Toni's clothes-obsessed wife, and Hisako, the girl he tries to hire to replace her.

""Toni Takitani"" is the only Ichikawa Jun film to get a US release, to the best of my knowledge.  He is definitely a director to watch out for, and I will be keeping an eye out for any future releases.",1239148800,2,3160,6.425531914893617
8091121,4,B000BQ7JXO,"Haruki Murakami is one of Japan's celebrated modern novelist. His works usually consists of stories of life, longing, love and loss--blended in surrealism with Murakami's gifted way of phrases. His stories are often magical but maintains a realist feel and his descriptions are full of mood. Adapting his short story ""TONY TAKITANI"" would be no simple task, but director Jun Ichikawa (Osaka Story, Tokyo Lullaby) succeeds in bringing this story to life--mostly because he almost follows the novel word for word.

Tony Takitani (Issei Ogata) is an artist. His father Shozaburo Takitani (also played by Ogata) is a free-spirited, traveling musician and Tony's mother had died 3 days after his birth and his childhood was mostly spent alone with only the housekeeper as company. Tony (so named because his father thought it would be cool for him to have a Western name) becomes an isolated child but he becomes able to fend for himself that he dismisses the housekeeper even before he became a teenager. Tony is left completely alone for long periods of time.
Now, after excelling in art school, Tony becomes a successful artist/illustrator of machines. His career is his life and marriage is the furthest thing from his mind. That is until he meets a beautiful woman named Eiko Konuma (gorgeous Rie Miyazawa) and Tony instantly falls in love.

Tony thought: ""She wore her clothes with such naturalness and grace that she could have been a bird that had enveloped itself on a special wind as it prepared to fly off to another world."" (Deep isn't it?)

They prove to be a good match (even though Tony is 15 years older) and they marry. Tony finally experiences happiness and fears as to what may happen if she disappears. Their union is perfect, but there is just one bump--Eiko is a compulsive shopper who spends so much money in designer clothes. Tony asks her to cut down on her shopping and being the obedient wife, she obeys although she becomes burdened with the thought of not shopping. Her penchant for high couture fashion leads to darkly satiric consequences.

The film is amazingly shot. The direction by Ichikawa is so full of emotional melancholy that the film itself looks very beautiful. The proceedings itself may have a ""sleepy"" feel but it is never boring. The original novel is a short story so Ichikawa serves up a very short film at 75 minutes. Ozu had greatly influenced Ichikawa and therefore he is a very minimalist filmmaker; his camera shots are kept restrained and simple, keeps thing in perspective, fixed but every so often the camera pans from left to right. The style is almost a cinematic painting by itself and is very precise. I rather thought that the camera pans symbolizes the passage of time and the occasionally close ups and floor shots symbolizes changes and the walking parts the journey.

The characters in the film barely speak. They speak to one another, but most of the story is told by a narrator, who at times has his sentences completed when one of the characters chime in. Sometimes the characters even refer to themselves in the third person while they narrate, which gives the film a mythical feel or perhaps a fable. The voice over is pretty much word for word passages from the original novella. The narrator itself conveys alienation and is a very effective style to emulate its moody feel. The film is full of emotion, Tony didn't exactly limit his human contacts and killed his emotions (emotionless drawings as a metaphor) but he just didn't know what he was missing in his life, his loneliness was his state of being. Tony didn't even realize that he was lonely until he met Eiko (rightfully played by Rie Miyazawa, Twilight Samurai) who embodied beauty and enabled him to see the vibrant color in this life.

Eiko is a complex woman. She is beautiful, young and smart, Eiko also proves to be a dutiful and worthy wife. Her one flaw is her compulsive shopping and I think this mirrors the emptiness that needs to be filled, she finds clothes to be her one ""filler"" that seems endless. Her clothes represent her presence in this world or may be interpreted as a metaphor for the need for material things in order to feel alive--or maybe to have a three-dimensional existence. The plaintive music by award winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto complements the film's mood and character, which results in a seductively, contemplative atmosphere.

I cannot say anymore without spoiling the film. Suffice it to say, ""Tony Takitani"" is a haunting story of longing, loneliness and happiness, love and loss. Director Ichikawa proves to be the right filmmaker to bring this story to life. He brilliantly sticks to the source material although he somewhat steers a little from Murakami's original climax in the novel and there is an added scene with one of Eiko`s ex-boyfriends. The film does manage to display its key emotions successfully and while it does have certain mistakes, it is very light in characterization and story, heavy in mood. The film is beautiful, and Ichikawa's direction is deeply focused. It is surreal and full of downhearted singularity that will envelop you with a warmth full of serenity--ready to transport you to a small isolated world.

It is NOT an uplifting story, nor is it for everyone but it is very REAL and Honest.

Highly Recommended! to fans of Japanese ""Art"" films [4 - Stars]",1234224000,,5357,4.845901639344262
8091122,5,B000BQ7JXO,"This is a stylish and spare film that does a fantastic job of bringing the Haruki Murakami short story to the screen. Ryuichi Sakamoto's equally spare piano-based soundtrack is equally evocative and well suited to help tell this melancholy tale of love and longing. I wasn't sure what to expect, but ending up loving this moving film.

Now to get Peter Jackson to shoot his version of Murakami's ""Hard-Boiled Wonderland""!",1219968000,2,421,5.014285714285714
