8103569,3,B000E0VO2Y,"Usually ""excerpts"" concern the well known arias from various operas, this DVD constitutes however an exception. Whithin the major operas sung by great singers ... you get the least well known arias of these same operas. If you are NOT a confirmed opera fan, you might just as well choose another DVD to get your initiation.",1151539200,5,323,4.785714285714286
8103570,5,B000E0VO2Y,"This is another sampler dvd from TDK and it contains complete arias from operas ranging from the 18th to the 20th centuries.  They are sung by some of the worlds greatest singers and the selection is quite interesting.  The only problem I have with this is the pervasive use of lip-synching in the newer operas on dvd.  Why is lip-synching used so much in opera?  I believe the reason is to get better camera angles.  During the live performance they record the sound track and audience reaction, but for the dvd they shoot the action using lip-synch and put the cameras in places that they could not during the live performance.  This seems to be becoming the norm, rather than the exception, nowadays.  A great deal of spirit is lost in this process.  When we see opera in the normal way, as we have here in some of the older segments, we can see the difference.  You would think that with all our technology we could find a better way of doing this, but what is the use in complaining? Many singers have complained about this also, but there is little they can do about it either. So this sampler is as good as it gets--for now.",1144022400,7,1131,4.42512077294686
8103571,5,B000E0VO2Y,"If you don't mind 'bleeding chunks' from opera DVDs this sampler might very well be for you. It starts with Carlos Kleiber conducting the Prelude to 'Carmen', then moves on to Ren&eacute;'e Fleming singing 'Je marche sur tous les chemins' from 'Manon' and before it's finished 121 minutes later we've had a chance to see/hear a total of 27 selections, including Edita Gruberov'&aacute; singing Elvira's 'Vien, diletto' from 'I Puritani,' Ren'&eacute;e Fleming again in an aria from Strauss's 'Capriccio', Marcelo '&Aacute;lvarez singing 'Che gelida manina' from 'La Boh'&egrave;me', the Donner and Blitzen polka from 'Die Fledermaus from the Vienna State Opera, Fiorenza Cossotto doing Azucena's 'Condotta ell'era in ceppi' from 'Il Trovatore', the Polonaise from 'Eugene Onegin',  Thomas Hampson's Macbeth ('Piet&agrave;, rispetto, amore'), Neil Shicoff and Bryn Terfel in a scene from 'Tales of Hoffmann', 'Ombra mai fu' from Handel's 'Serse', Reri Grist as Zerbinetta, with Sena Jurinac in 'Ein Augenblick ist wenig' from 'Ariadne auf Naxos' (with Karl B'&ouml;hm conducting), Eva Mei in 'Ah! Non credea mirarti' from 'La Sonnambula', Johan Botha as Calaf in 'Turandot', Maria Guleghina as Manon in Puccini's 'Manon Lescaut,' and much, much more. Other outstanding scenes include 'O welch ein Augenblick' from 'Fidelio' with comers Camilla Nylund and Jonas Kaufmann, and Karita Mattila as Amelia in 'Simon Boccanegra', and Pl'&aacute;cido Domingo singing 'Forse la soglia attinse' from 'Un Ballo in Maschera.'

These are all scenes from complete stage performances of the operas mentioned. Sounds and sight are marvelous, in general, although perhaps less so in the older productions (e.g., 'Ariadne auf Naxos').

For a very modest price one can sample these scenes and perhaps make a decision to buy the full performance of one or more of them. Not a bad deal, I'd say.
