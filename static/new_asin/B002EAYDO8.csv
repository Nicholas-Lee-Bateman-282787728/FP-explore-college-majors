8367132,5,B002EAYDO8,"Innovative and risky, this is one of my top five movies.  I am so pleased to be able to see it again since VHS days gone by.  Not for everyone, this skillful film portrays youth and a loving Divinity versus aging and a vengeful God.  George Hamilton has a shiny face throughout the picture, and Mercedes McCambridge is carefully made up matte, emphasizing their distance in age and worldview.",1418428800,,392,4.6521739130434785
8367133,5,B002EAYDO8,"Mercedes was great.
I didn't like the fact she wasn't the star.
George Hamilton was good too.
Burt wasn't good.",1370908800,,111,4.6
8367134,1,B002EAYDO8,"I ordered this video and it took nearly a month to arrive because it was being shipped from England.  Once I received it, it wouldn't play - at all.  I have had two friends try it on their DVD just to make sure mine wasn't the problem and it didn't work on theirs either.  Because it was shipped from Europe, do you think it could only be compatible with European DVD's?  I got it for my elderly uncle who plays a cameo role in the film and we were so disappointed that it didn't work.

Is there a way to get my money back, or get an exchange?",1328486400,2,543,3.990740740740741
