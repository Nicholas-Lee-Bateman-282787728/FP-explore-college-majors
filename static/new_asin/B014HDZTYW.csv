8730779,4,B014HDZTYW,"Like most Zappa fans, I've been waiting for years for this movie to come out. Until now, I could only use my imagination to see how the actual performances occurred.  I was not disappointed, the performances were about what I expected, and the ""BeBop Tango"" was more demented and sillier than I had anticipated. I wonder where Brenda is and is she still performing?  ""Cheepnis"" and ""Penguin in Bondage"" were great.  The only complaint I have is the cheesy marketing direction taken in promoting this DVD:  ""Every fan his prisoner, every guitar his slave.""  This is not a monster movie, well except for Cheepnis.  ""Roxie the Movie"" is a interesting signpost in Frank Zappa's career and displays the performance one of the better ensembles he ever put together.",1456963200,2,759,4.890625
8730780,5,B014HDZTYW,"Ever since the first time I listened to Zappa's ""Roxy and Elsewhere"" album, I have been waiting for the movie. Well it's here and it was worth the wait. There is a great explanation of what took so long by both Gail Zappa and John Albarian, the mad engineer who took what  had been a total disaster in the filming/recording of the three nights over which this was filmed, and using technology only recently available, turned it into a pure masterpiece. Trying any sooner could have meant the ruin of the film and soundtrack. The Zappa Family Trust owes him a true debt of gratitude, as do all FZ fans everywhere.
This film demonstrates just how masterful his musicians had to be. The music is very complex and full of key, time signature and tempo changes and they play it all by heart. As he would later do with a percussion piece called, ""The Black Page"",(Terri Bozio), he takes the music to ""Cheepnis"" and has the percussion section (including himself) play the most amazing piece, incredibly complex, incredibly challenging, and to watch them do this on stage is just flabbergasting. I am a trained percussionist, and how they all pull off the co-ordination required without sheet music is a joy to watch and hear.
The show is filled with Frank's spontaneous interactions with the audience, as well as audience participation onstage.
Having only heard ""Big Swifty"" performed by Frank's ""Grand Wazoo"" band, hearing this band pull it off is, again, just pure joy. Other instrumentals, such as ""T'Mershi Duween,"" ""The Dog Breath Variations/Uncle Meat,"" ""Enchidna's Arf (of You)"",  ""Don't You Ever Wash That Thing?"" and ""Be-Bop Tango of the Old Jazzmans's Church,"" just left me breathless.
The songs requiring vocals, like, ""I'm The Slime,""  ""Cheepnis,"" ""Penguin in Bondage"" and ""Inca Roads"" display the voluminous talents of keyboardist, George Duke, and Saxophonist, Flutist, not to mention FZ himself.  Much of the band does harmony vocals and strange sounds as cued by FZ.
If you are familiar with the ""Roxy and Elsewhere"" album, there are some things added, such as the encore of ""The Idiot Bastard Son,"" and some left out of the concert film but added as a bonus track, ""Pygmy Twylyte"", a much longer version that includes the long solo of the sort you can hear on ""You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore,"" (Vol. 2, Disc 1, track 9).
Overall, this is the best video of a Zappa concert I have ever seen. It is fresh and exciting music, of the like that no one is playing today. There was only one Frank Zappa and this video proves just what a genius he was.",1456358400,4,2558,4.741573033707865

8730783,5,B014HDZTYW,"FINALLY!!!  The Holy Grail of Zappa concert footage has finally been officially released by the Zappa Family.  Anyone who's a fan knows what this is and knows how long we've been waiting for this to finally get released.  From the credits it looks like Ahmet had a lot to do with the production of the video though I was genuinely surprised to not see Dweezil's name attached to the production credits.  Given Dweezil's dedication at trying to make sure new generations of fans around the world still get the opportunity to hear Frank's music performed live, I would think Dweezil would want to be involved in the video and audio production from the hours of footage filmed from the 3 days they played at The Roxy.  You would think Dweezil would have been a perfect choice to have been involved.  You have to wonder if there's a bit of stress in the family camp or did mommy feel she had to give the other brother something to do to feel more involved.  That's not to say Ahmet didn't do a great job, just oddly curious that Dweezil wasn't involved in such a treasured and long anticipated project.

As for the concert video it's just about as great as you'd expect.  I loved the split screen effects they used at times but wish they used more of it.  The song selection is naturally awesome.  Dog/Meat (The Dog Breath Variations), Don't You Ever Wash That Thing?, RDNZL, Echidna's Arf (of you), The Be-Bop Tango. Just a few and all fantastic.  The ONLY disappointment?  It's only 95 minutes long!  What's up with that?!  C'mon guys!  They played for 3 days!  This is the digital age.  Maybe we're going to get The Roxy DVD Volume 2 some day.  And then Volume 3.  And for some unexplained reason they put 3 songs, Pygmy Twylyte, Idiot Bastard Son and Dickie's Such an Assh*le on the ""extra tracks"" menu.  Don't understand that one.

But anyway, it's finally here.  Thank you Zappa Family.  It sure was a long long wait but it's truly magical.",1446163200,10,1942,4.546242774566474
