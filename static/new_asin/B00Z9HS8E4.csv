7271641,5,B00Z9HS8E4,I saw this movie on its release date in a sold out theater and was amazed.  Nobody left the theater during the show.  Everyone was totally into it.  Many views by experts are presented often on location.  They speak both for and against accepting the Bible's account Israel's exodus from Egypt.  The producer uses a 'Wall of Time' with historical events marked and this makes the timeline understandable.  It's a very dramatic film.  The music was almost all original and scored specifically for this film.  I loved it.,1438646400,2,519,4.818181818181818

7271643,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"I am not big on documentary type DVDs, but this sounded interesting. It took a little while to get my attention, but then I found myself getting into it after the first 10-15 minutes. The DVD is not one man talking the whole time. It is narrated some and the man who did the DVD talks with several different people throughout the DVD. There are scenes from Bible movies, photographs, views of different scenes, and other graphs and documents pictured throughout the DVD.

  I never realized how much disagreement and doubt there is about the Exodus story. Many archaeologists claim that there is no proof found in archaeology for the Exodus. I don't want to give too much away, but Mahoney shows that there is a lot of proof for the Exodus if the commonly accepted date for it is moved back a certain amount of years. I found the information and proof he presented fascinating, and was amazed at the things they have found that do prove the Bible is right about the Exodus, Jericho, and other events in and around Egypt and the Exodus. Granted, this isn't like watching a fast-paced movie, but I enjoyed the DVD and found my faith in the Bible rejuvenated and it made me more convinced than ever that God's Word is true.",1438387200,6,1220,4.536363636363636
7271644,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"This a great family movie! My children (all above the age of 9) really enjoyed it. It is quite lengthy, so we watched it over a course of 3 nights.
I was very surprised at the Filmmakers discoveries, they definitely left me pondering the historical timeline of the Bible. -but NOT questioning my faith-.
I also appreciated the time and traveling he took to make a film. Many Christians would never be able to explore, see, and experience what he brings to the film.  He also did not limit his interviews to those whom agreed with the history of the Bible. I was impressed he even had the Prime Minister of Israel!",1438041600,7,613,4.473214285714286
7271645,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"I just watched the DVD. Archaeologists have found 12 tombs (that I believe were for Joseph's and his brothers' bodies) near each other, and one of them is larger & more ornate (& shaped like a pyramid, from what they showed!).  And a statue of a red-haired man was in the tomb!  Also they have found houses that were similar to ones that might have been found in the area of Syria, a large canal with the name with something like ""Joseph's canal"" (that would have been used to help store water from the Nile during the years of plenty in the story of Joseph).  So much in this DVD provides evidence that goes along with the Old Testament - like the walls of Jericho that fell down all at once.  I really enjoyed the video & learned from it!",1436918400,31,740,4.264285714285714
7271646,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"First, I have to say that normally I am not one to watch a documentary; I learn best usually via printed material.  However, for whatever purpose, God really led me to sit down and watch the DVD from beginning to end.  There aren't enough words to express how astounding and encouraging it made me feel at the end.  I knew that Timothy P. Mahoney was a seeker when he made this film.  He was honest enough to say he really didn't want to have anything to do with making a film.  What kept him going on were the thoughts and questions that continued to stir up his heart and mind and without these answers he wouldnt be able to walk away.  For me, that is the Spirit of God working on his heart.
I continued to be astounded by how Timothy traveled to various places to interview individuals and to look at or read documents or books that have been around for decades.  As Timothy would respectfully question learned men who are experts in their field, he listened attentively.  Timothy would then review repeatedly what he just learned, draw up his questions and resume his search for answers. Timothy tells us what he doesnt know about the many fields he seeks answers from and how he is just a film maker.  That to me is evidence of a humble man.",1436745600,49,1247,4.386956521739131
7271647,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"For many people to believe the Bible, they are looking for proof that it's true. Despite all the archaeological evidence that has been found, people are still trying to figure out where the evidence comes into play regarding the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and everything that went along with that story from the Bible. From the ten plagues that hardened Pharoah's heart to the pilgrimage of the people for 40 years into the desert, even the fall of Jericho's walls. So why all the inconsistencies? Is there proof from the Bible, that the story has played out exactly as it was written? If so where is the proof in the world today that can validate the claims that it happened exactly as Exodus clearly lays out for the reader?

Drawing on the experience of many biblical scholars, curators, archaeologists and scientists, film maker Timothy Mahoney documents his research into this compelling question to uncover whether this exodus of the Israelites truly happened or has the Bible clearly gotten it wrong. He journeys to Egypt, the Middle East, England and more in search for the answers in the documentary Patterns for Evidence Exodus. It will take his on a 12-year journey around the world to search for the same answers the world is waiting for and what he finds at the end, well it's up to you to decide if the evidence he uncovers validates what is written in the Bible. Using stunning animations, narrated by Kevin Sorbo, interviews with leading archaeologists like Israel Finkelstein, Kent Weeks, and David Rohl and guest appearances by Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Shimon Peres. This 119 minute documentary also features bonuses like Behind the Music, From Film to Book, trailers and more.

I received Patterns of Evidence Exodus compliments of Thinking Man Films and Propeller LLC for my honest review and did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review outside of the free copy of the DVD. I love it when you can find documentaries like this one that show both sides of the argument and where the division between the two sides stands. I especially love that this went beyond the story of the Israelites and showcased so much more like Abraham's journey to the fall of the walls of Jericho and what they discovered that many had never known before. I don't want to give it all away but I think Timothy Mahoney did an incredible job at his research putting this one together and well worth all 4.5 out of 5 stars.",1436659200,63,2453,4.783018867924528
7271648,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"I saw this documentary at a special one-night-only showing in a theater of my town earlier this year.  The place was packed, and everyone seemed awestruck by the experience.  At the end, we all just sat there, then finally began to get up and walk out.  The audience consisted of Jews and Christians, as well as others who were just curious about the veracity of the Exodus.  I know that I came away with a feeling that I had just seen something profound, and evidently many others in that theater felt the same as me that night.  I've been waiting all this time for it to go on sale as a CD.

7271650,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Although I do not know allot about Egyptian archeology, I thought this was a very informative and easy to understand discussion of some of the available evidence.  Basically, from what I understood, archeologists who study Egyptian artifacts already have an established narrative/chronology and if the artifacts differ with their chronology, then they just dismiss the evidence of the artifacts.  For example, Jericho was excavated and the walls were found to have fallen outward (not inward, as you would expect if someone was knocking the wall down from the outside) and there was evidence of fire damage in the strata.  The archeological artifacts match the biblical description of the fall of Jericho, but the archeologists say that it does not match because the TIME FRAME does not match THEIR time frame of then THEY THINK Jericho was supposed to have fallen.  So, instead of letting the evidence adjust their science and chronology (which is what science is supposed to do), they just staunchly adhere to their chronological timetable.  The premise of this film is to allow the evidence speak for itself - let the artifacts adjust our understanding of the past, rather than modern archeologists insist that the past MUST conform to their inviolable timeframe.  The old-school archeologists will not change but, possibly, as new minds are introduced to new evidence, new archeologists may arise that can better fit the pieces together and allow the data to adjust our understanding and chronology. Highly recommend you watch this film.",1528588800,,1541,5.218623481781377

7271665,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"That is how the classical composer Schumann introduced his fellow genius Brahms to the world.

This documentary is a classic.

It is filmed beautifully and clearly, so that with pleasure we can follow in Mahoney's footsteps, follow his determination to dig deep for the truth, with excitements and disappointments every step of the way. And I appreciate the courtesy Mahoney extended to the many experts he interviewed and consulted  even though he finally concludes he must disagree with all who say there is no evidence for the Israelite Exodus out of Egypt, as described in the Bible.

The evidence for Exodus is a serious matter for all people of faith, as far as I am concerned. For over 70 years now, the mainstream archaeological theories have conspired with all the evidence to show a very thorough *lack* of evidence for the Biblical stories of the Exodus, thus challenging over 3000 years of belief for both Jews and Christians.

But this film has shown me that the Biblical story of Exodus did happen; moreover, it happened exactly as described in the Bible, without the tiniest archaeological detail of evidence being missing or faulty. For if we look for *patterns of evidence*, and put the dates to one side, we discover that every single Biblical detail fits the evidence strongly  strong because the pattern does fit, timewise, only at a different time period; and each piece of evidence is unique, powerful, and unexpected  exactly as the Bible stories themselves convey.

When filmmaker Tim Mahoney discovered that all the mainstream archaeologists said that there was absolutely no evidence for the Exodus ever having taken place as described in the Bible, he could no longer sit comfortably with his Christian faith if it was so strongly rooted in a historical lie. The story of Exodus has, after all, details of such magnitude that it was unthinkable there should be no archaeological record unless Exodus was a complete fabrication. Is it possible that since the earliest times, the Jews, then Jesus, then Christendom, should have fallen for so graphical, so collossal, and so supportive a story if it was only a myth? What was Mahoney going to tell his grandchildren? Unable to let the matter rest, he decided to investigate for himself, armed only with his film-making skills, his innate faith, intelligence and commonsense, and a deep wish to find the truth, wherever that might lead him.

Mahoney's first forays to Egypt seemed to go nowhere. The archaeologists explained that the Exodus took place at the time of Ramesses II (the Late Bronze Age) - and had left no evidence.

He then reasoned that he should put aside any presupposition that we know the exact dates, and he should just look to see if there was evidence at any time of Egyptian history that fitted the pattern of the Bible stories. He figured out there were six parts to the story for which he would hope to find evidence:
* the presence of a Hebrew family of twelve in the Egyptian Delta, one of them serving a very high position under Pharaoh
* a subsequent multiplication of population
* followed by slavery and infanticide of males
* awful things suddenly happening to the Egyptians
* a very sudden departure of all the Hebrews
* Joshuas conquest of Canaan, starting with Jericho.

Mahoney then created excellent visual aids to chart the progress in his findings, through each of these six stages: a great Wall of Time, marked by pylons every 1000 years, with layers of wall showing the absolute dates, the three principal Egyptian kingdoms, the Biblical date records, and dating from other Near East archaeology eg at Jericho.
The Old Kingdom is when the great Pyramids were built.
The Middle Kingdom is when literature and the arts flourished.
The New Kingdom built massive monuments and a massive empire.
And following each Kingdom were times of weakness and confusion.

Mahoney found unequivocally clear evidence for each of these six parts, exactly in the right time sequence  but it all happened during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt  whereas Ramesses is in the New Kingdom, hundreds of years later. The Ipuwer Papyrus contains graphic Egyptian descriptions of desolation that exactly fits the Israelite description of the plagues as recorded in the Bible. And there is very telling evidence for Joseph and his twelve brothers in Avaris, which lies underneath the later city of Ramesses and is now being excavated.

The destruction of Jericho fits the Middle Kingdom period (= Middle Bronze Age) too, and again the evidence matches the Biblical story detail for detail: a completely fire-damaged city interior, including burnt grain stores that suggest a very short springtime siege; and a single area on the perimeter wall that was not destroyed, that suggests Rahab's house being protected.

In the end it becomes clear that the evidence for Exodus during the Middle Bronze Age actually far exceeds the quantity or quality of the evidence traditionally used to date the Exodus as during the time of Ramesses  but still, mainstream experts put aside each piece of evidence as coincidence, without seeming to notice how massive the evidence is when put together. Or rather, some are noticing, but are afraid to speak out, to rock the boat.

Mahoney has done something that takes courage and has left us all a tremendous legacy: he persistently stood up for truth; followed the rocky evidence wherever it would lead; and invites us to do the same, to make no assumptions that any theoretical source, either of biblical or of secular archaeological origin, is correct.

There is a lot more evidence out there that needs similar work and standards to be applied to it. I feel that Mahoney has set a standard the next generation should live up to. This is truly a work of Spiritual Science, the spiritual redemption of Scientific Method that has long been called-for.",1520121600,,5863,4.940040650406504

His journey is the same as my own, so I found this movie to be reassuring. The Bible is historically reliable and time will prove what is right.
Political and humanist powers will certainly resist the dates, places and existence of Hebrews/Israel in the Middle Kingdom and just prior to the Hyksos. To let that be truth would affirm the Bible; this, they can not allow.

The moments where Mahoney is pondering while sitting and drinking coffee or staring at artifacts are a bit contrived, but it's acceptable filler to connect parts of the film.  And yes, for those with the typical 3-second attention span so common today I'm sure it moved slowly, but I thought the pace was fine. The credits at the end were actually very enjoyable to watch and the music beautiful.

I don't adhere to the mainstream convention that people without credentials should be ignored or taken with a grain of salt.  From my experience in the medical field I know that mainstream medicine has embraced theories since the late '50s on for example, the ""evils"" of saturated fat, and ignored data on the problems with sugar. These theories have been disproved time and time again--and those data having been ignored by those with credentials in order to satisfy their biases or paradigms.  If their stances were to have to change, they would risk having all of their work invalidated--meaning entire careers ruined.

The same applies in the fields of archeology, Egyptology, and history.  I am not enamored of those simply adhering to theories because famous people with big names stated them. Even the most famous of us are human and subject to human failings. Credentials do not automatically convey a desire to seek the truth. True scientists do not say, ""Case closed.""  They say, ""Prove me wrong.""  They welcome opposing viewpoints.  And not just from others with credentials.  Anyone with a brain who can think and comprehend the subject can arrive at a theory.  Einstein was a nobody postal worker when he came up with his first theory of relativity.  And a true scientist continues to question and challenge himself until his dying day, no matter what the consequences.  How many of those do you think you'll find?

Yes, individual criticisms such as the statue in the tomb possibly not being of Joseph are valid, but taken as a whole, the incidences in the bible and the findings presented in the film are striking and certainly coincide more with the middle period than the late period. So a true scientist would welcome this revelation and go back and look for a possible discrepancy in Egyptian dating rather than dismiss it as religious fanatacism. No argument needed--just dismiss your opponent with ad hominems or generalizations. Most of the negative comments on this film either did not specifically argue any of the points made in the film, or they cherry picked certain points and ignored others--much as they claimed the film maker did.

For those assuming Mahoney thinks this is a slam dunk, look at the table of contents selection for the next film in the ""series,"" Mahoney does intend to explore the specific evidence or lack thereof regarding the exodus--for example, that of the lack of pots and utensils one might expect to see.  Although admittedly, and Richard E. Freedman points this out, when you consider the vastness of the desert, and the layers of blowing sand over the millenia, it might be hard to find anything in any one particular place.",1516320000,3,3149,4.889097744360902

7271682,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Disturbed by the opinions of not only the atheists but by the belief of the rabbi of the largest congregation in the United States, filmmaker Timothy Mahoney set out to find the truth about the exodus of Moses and the Jewish people from the book of Exodus in the Bible and in the Torah.  Mahoney uses the patterns of evidence in the Bible, the Torah, in history, science, and in other religious writings to help him come to his final conclusion.

Having an issue with the time period of the exodus, Mahoney worked with an agnostic archaeologist, David Rohl, to pinpoint what they believe to be the correct time period.  Traditionally, it is believed that the Exodus occurred during the reign of Ramses (Exodus 1:11, Exodus 12:37) in the New Kingdom period, however, the name Ramses in the Bible actually refers to a place and not the ruler.

Mahoney and Rohl, as well as a number of other archaeologists, believe that based on the collapse of a number of cities in the area of Israel, including the collapse and burning of Jericho, that the exodus actually occurred 400 years sooner than the historically accepted time period.  Even the destruction of Jericho shows that a wall of residences was the only wall that didn't collapse during the destruction, which supports the Biblical account of Rahab and her family in Joshua 6:22-25.

They also used historical events such as the fall of Egypt and the increase in the pharaohs great wealth during a famine (Genesis 41).  In the city of Avaris, there was a palace home found with 12 pillars and on the property were 12 tombs.  One of the tombs was a small pyramid, given only to powerful people, with a large statue of what appears to be a Semitic leader in a colorful robe.  It appears that this was the home of Joseph and his family (or certainly someone with the same type of rising to power).  The interesting thing was that the pyramid tomb was empty of bones which reflect Josephs wishes (Genesis 50:24-26, Exodus 13:19, Joshua 24:32).

Science and faith both search for the truth.  Have archaeologists accepted an incorrect time for the exodus?  What repercussions would come from correcting the dates?  All of the surrounding countries histories are dated based on the history of Egypt.  Even archaeological history falls into place based on the findings of Mahoney and Rohl, however, no one wants to change history by centuries because the current dates are assumed to be fixed.

Patterns of Evidence is a fascinating documentary that I believe was very well researched and thought out.  Even my husband, who really loves and has studied history was amazed by the findings.",1513900800,,2631,4.785398230088496

Let me give you a challenge to that perspective; This film.

This movie is eye opening to a major political agenda. It's the idea that the Bible is wrong just because the language of the Bible doesn't match archeology of current day. This film shows that if your starting point is wrong then your results will be wrong.

How much of your daily or historical life is based on ""circumstances"" ?

What if historical assumptions are being used to manipulate your faith and view of the world?

Chronology is not fixed, it's not final.

I don't like the idea of having to twist history to make the events of the Bible fit. The ""experts"" determined that the Exodus must have taken place about 200 years earlier than the time period described in Biblical writings. To me, that alters the entire timeline of the rest of the Bible, and that makes me extremely uncomfortable.

I was somewhat skeptical at first but I usually am when it comes to documentaries on the Bible. To see the historical paralleled with the biblical is fascinating. There is a lot of excellent content in this documentary and I do think there is plenty of things to learn from it.

In the film, Mahoney interviews Egyptologists, Biblical scholars, and archaeologist in order to find support or deny whether the Exodus is a true account. Throughout the film, viewers are presented with arguments for and against the Biblical account and are left to make up their own minds.

I appreciated the timelines and the historical details, including archaeology finds, historical accounts, and more. The research is well-laid out and full of interesting facts that are sure to create dialogue in small group studies.

I was surprised by the high quality of the production from video to music to interview subjects. A lot of topics were covered from plagues to papyrus, Joseph, and the Jericho walls.
I was a little confused by some of the dates, and I felt that the filmmaker considered the timing the key point of the Exodus. With that, a little more to explain/prove dates would have been helpful.
I am a simpleton of faith and believe in the Exodus because I believe the Bible is God inspired and a true account. The Israelites shared their history through story, and they story has held true for thousands of years. That said, Bible reader, history fan, or just curious, I believe this is important to watch.

I was saddened to see so many, including the religious, deny the truth of Gods Word.  But as I said, this has not changed. Man will always say NO to God until he himself realizes He is a sinner in need of the Savior, Jesus Christ.  The film director leaves it to yourself to decide whether or not The Exodus really happened.  God too allows us to make choices in life.  We can choose to believe or deny Him.

7271715,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"I have gone through the entire book of Exodus literally four times through these years. I have always been fascinated with the stories of how the Israelites prospered in Egypt, eventually turned into slavery, and then freed to the promised land in Canaan. I guess as of today, no one can proof that such events actually took place. This is fine with me as I read the Bible with faith instead of doubts. The Patterns of Evidence provided a logical explanation with convincing data that such events ""could"" have happened by re-aligning the chronological order of when these events took place.

One area which seemed contradicting was the analysis of the statue Joseph by pointing out the.colorful robe of the statue which matched with the one Jacob gave to Joseph. However, according to the Bible (Genesis 37:13), Joseph's robe was stripped by their brothers before they sold him to the Egyptians.  This sounded more like a bit of exaggeration unless Joseph always liked to wear colorful robes while he was in Egypt.

7271755,1,B00Z9HS8E4,"Religious propaganda. Despite the fact that all the professionals he talks to tell him that there is no evidence for the Exodus beyond an ancient folk-myth of dubious provenance, the presenter is then determined to launch an ""investigation"". The problem is, it isn't an ""investigation"", it's merely searching for confirmation of his own shaky religious beliefs from non-authoritative Bible-quoting sources who are prepared to confirm speculative positions - as with most instances of confirmation bias, everything that doesn't agree with his position is discarded, and the position that the Exodus never happened is never given serious consideration, because it doesn't agree with his indoctrinated religious beliefs. The presenter approaches this in a pseudo-scientific method that picks and chooses fragments of evidence to build supposed confirmation of a religious fiction - roping in fictional figures such as Joseph (of the coat of many colours) and trying to build farcical cases around it. The dubious, semi-fictional nature of the Bible is never explored, and it's all taken literally as Gospel truth and the basis for a pseudo-scientific series of random connections. I seriously pity anyone who would take this seriously, presumably it takes a fair degree of indoctrination to build this level of selective ignorance. I also found it difficult to understand the position of the ""Christian"" presenter - a religion supposedly of sacrifice and love of one's neighbour that says ""it is more difficult for a rich man to enter heaven than a camel/rope to go through the eye of a needle"" whilst the documentary dwells on a portly American strumming an expensive guitar in his luxury home, before flying several times half-way across the world to confirm his supposed beliefs, whilst children are starving not far away from where he indulged his farcical ""investigation"". Clearly confirming a self-sanctimonius religious position from his luxury home was more important than actually helping the sick and starving and actually practising his religion.",1484352000,,2054,5.4420062695924765

7271796,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"The film gives good overview of where the archeology has been and is today. It is an enjoyable watch, also. The film maker Tim Mahoney expresses his interest in finding archeological evidence for Old Testament stories. He says that his Christian heritage and love and concern for his family's well-being is of upmost importance. That is sensible, since if Christianity is true, then one would believe that salvation (belief in Christ and the Trinitarian God) is important for life and afterlife. He may have been wondering what happens if it's not true, what did we believe in? Is the world a desolate, meaningless place? I enjoyed the personal touch the filmmaker included in his search for archeological evidence.

 I believe Mahoney also stated the importance of many of these Hebrew stories for the progression to Christ's birth life, death, and resurrection. The Old Testament stories are important for Christianity. His findings or someone else's findings for or against could help strengthen or weaken the view of Christianity. Surely those findings could influence people to soften or harden towards Christianity. Without giving away what he finds, the film gives views from both sides. And, there are always differing views. It seems with Christianity it is fairly black and white. Either you are for it or against it if you are a scholar. I tend to think this is interesting. It makes me wonder who may be lying, who may just be plain wrong, and who is getting it right in the scholarship.

All in all, I doubt this video will convince you one way or the other. Christianity is about belief. And, whether you are driving to Wal-Mart or at a family Thanksgiving dinner, you are believing something. It may be safety in your car; it may be love of your family. And there is typically a bit of evidence for your beliefs. But, scientific-based evidence can be beneficial for showing that historic Christian events were possible or perhaps even happened.",1473120000,3,1959,4.930303030303031

Highly recommended for EVERY Christian and for EVERY person who had made the mistake of believing the ""historians"" and ""anthropologists"" and ""theologians"" who have used the opinions of humans to try and hide the historicity of the Bible.

7271832,3,B00Z9HS8E4,"To those familiar even in passing with Biblical archeology and related fields, the arguments in this well-made documentary will not be new.  They've been kicked around for decades, and they've been pretty soundly put to rest.

In fact, the more you know about such matters, the less likely you are to be impressed with the arguments.  (To take just one example, be dead certain you know that ""coat of many colors"" is a sound translation before you get excited about finding one.  Similarly, before you get excited about twelve tombs in an archeological site, better count them twice and analyze their layout in the strata.)

The filmmaker Mahoney, playing the time-honored role of convinced skeptic, admits with disarming honesty that he is not an expert in any of the very involved fields you'd need to master before evaluating the arguments of his academic ""stars,"" especially David Rohl.  It's just as well, as Rohl has been called out by academics for his suspect command of linguistics and archeology.  He relies a great deal on arguments that sound impressive to people who don't know much about his subject but which don't actually hold water.

To some of the faithful, of course, no apologetic is too shabby to use in the cause of God's Truth (though few of these will take the trouble to learn much Hebrew).  But hopefully the more honest among them will see this video as a good reason to expand their own knowledge, which will most likely lead to them rejecting its premises.",1465776000,3,1486,4.818897637795276

7271844,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This documentary provides compelling evidence of Old Testament events using six main sections under a framework of millennia: the arrival of Jacob and his family, population multiplication in Goshen, slavery, Gods judgments via Moses, the Exodus, and Joshuas conquest of Canaan.

Standout evidences include the Ipwer Papyrus containing the plagues of Egypt, the statue of Joseph and his [empty] tomb in Avaris, Goshen, and the ruins of Jericho with its burnt grain stores and fire-damaged interior.

Filmmaker Tim Mahoney approaches his project from an almost agnostic position and without much scripture, so the production does not have a direct evangelistic impact. The most lively (and persuasive) historian David Rohl, though an agnostic, seems more zealous than Mr Mahoney.

At 119 minutes and with great summaries after each chapter the education value is high. For those that already believe the Holy Bible there is much ammunition, meaning even less reasons for the sceptic to remain scornful.",1464739200,20,1001,5.445161290322581

The bias of academia is so obvious. They have based their conclusions and studies on false premises, but would  rather believe a lie than the truth, just like the Bible warns us. This is one of the best done documentaries I've seen which supports the reliability of the biblical account of history. Some have more hope than facts. This is replete with dozens of factual evidences which add up to a fairly conclusive proof that the secularists who attempt to deny there is evidence of the Exodus are blind to truths all around them. This is very well done and I will be sharing it with many others. I look forward to any follow up films.

When the narrator summarizes everything he's said up to that point in the film, I suggest you take a pause, get a drink, some popcorn, or whatever, then strap on your thinking cap!

I really didn't realize the huge importance of dealing with this project, until I saw the interviews on the screen. I thought that this was basic information. - That that the main issue was wether the jews in the Exodus went through the wast wilderness of the Sinai Desert or as recently discovered( Jim &.

7271878,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"This is a  very interesting theory and one which should be investigated further.  In essence, it postulates that if the generally accepted dates of the Exodus were pushed back 200 years, the story would line up with what is known of ancient Egyptian history.  It is a theory, however, and should not yet be accepted as fact.  But it is true that archaeologists are very reluctant to change what they have built reputations and careers on publishing and teaching, even if new theories seem to offer more complete explanations of what really happened.  This new theory to me makes complete sense, but then I'm not an archaeologist and have no vested interest in continuing the current beliefs among archaeologist about what happened and when.  As with any field of endeavor, vested interests frequently trump any evidence to the contrary.  We've certainly seen that with the climate change imbroglio, when climatologists actually fudged data to meet political demands.  The same is true in all scientific fields, unfortunately.  The video is very enjoyable and thought-provoking, and should provide material for further study.",1461024000,17,1124,5.2

7271885,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This is a very good documentary and is just happens it tied directly into a recent bible study I participated in on pride.  The scientific community is never going to openly admit they've miscalculated a timeline by a few thousand years.  You could have photographic evidence and they'd dispute it if that were possible.  It's amazing that all this evidence has been tossed aside because it doesn't fit the timeline they've created.  It's become so clear that the mainstream scientific community is anything but scientific on many topics today.  One of the skeptics in this documentary was not at all being honest and you could see it in his face as he spoke.  He didn't believe what he was saying...I won't name names here just to be kind.  In any case the hardest words to say are 'I was wrong' and that is pride.  We Christians just have faith and we know what we know.  It is really great to see the evidence whether the official 'scientists' wish to accept it or laugh it off which is clearly what's taken place here.  I think most of us know we aren't ever going to see any big news stories plastered across all the front pages when it comes to news supporting the biblical narrative.  Like I said, we know what we know.  It's a good show and I highly recommend it.",1459555200,2,1271,4.478260869565218

The filmmaker walked right in to the truth at the very beginning of his trek but was so easily thrown off because someone with a big reputation couldn't see straight. It was incomprehensible to me that the filmmaker could have been so disappointed by an obviously jaded expert addicted to his own point of view.
However, I then reckoned back to my my own many experiences with top academicians in cultural anthropology, Remembering all of that, I am not surprised to see that even in archaeology the ""top people""  bend the facts in order to suit their own worldview. They don't serve truth; they serve something. But, I haven't quite figured out what that is.

'Mainstream' religion, and/or science, has their own agenda and history to uphold so as not to cause, at a minimum, a questioning of, and as much as, a revolt against the traditions handed down to us through time. When the stories that we have received from authorities are scrutinized, certain obvious discrepancies are said to be unimportant to the overall message. But, when many of these small facts are tied together, it can establish the gateway to the greater understanding - Truth.
This film begins the path to a greater truth that could revolutionize modern Christianity, leading us to the perfect understanding of the Exodus, the Dead Sea Crossing, the real Mt. Sinai, and the overwhelming proof that our Bible is true; providing confirmation that God's word is our strength and will secure us through what is soon coming.
This offering, Part 1, is good, but when Part 2 becomes available, believers in truth may experience an awakening that will guide them to levels of Biblical understanding that will change their lives forever.",1454198400,3,1215,5.01980198019802

7271952,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This movie is fantastic. It brings to light evidence that is hard to argue against, and reveals much of the Bias that exists in the field of archaeology today. If your wondering why the ""signs"" of the exodus aren't there, look no further. They ARE there. it's like finding your keys...you just need to look in the right spot. People for generations have been looking in the wrong spots...heck, they never even bothered to challenge the spots they were told to look in. This author decided to do just that. stop following the crowd in ignorance, and simply look at what is there.

And what he finds is astounding. The author journeys from a place in life where he was disenchanted with the stories told to him of his faith when he was a child, and through this process of discovery, comes back to the truth of those tales, and his own faith, and in a way that was revitalizing to my own personal faith in the Bible. If your worried that this is one of those ""debunk the bible"" movies, it's not. quite the opposite, it points out how much of the bible is historically accurate if your willing to get past what people tell you and look for ""what is"". It's refreshing that for once, someone just looked for the evidence...and found it. worth watching, buying, and giving to others.",1453507200,7,1277,4.504310344827586

He then embarks on a 12-year journey around the world to get an answer. The film has stunning animations and interviews with leading archaeologists. Mahoney researches the theory that Egyptian chronology is actually off about 200 yearsand if so, any number of Biblical events fall into place. He has filmed archaeologists saying they find no evidence of the Exodus [where they expect to find it chronologically]. That there is evidence at an earlier time in history is immaterial. I have read other posts that say Mahoney is jumping to many conclusions but I thought he presented it, not as proof of the Exodus, but as enough evidence to question the establishment, the archaeologists whose careers would be at risk should they suggest that the ""accepted timeline of history"" might be off slightly.",1453334400,3,944,5.096774193548387

7271963,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Wow. Absolutely amazing. I'm floored. I had no idea so many archeologists didn't find evidence for the Exodus until this documentary. I assumed there was evidence, but it wasn't consistent. This guy has truly laid it out very clearly. Otherwise, it would be one heck of a coincidence for all of these events to follow one another is such a consistent pattern and yet no one draws the similarities to the Bible. The existence of an exact pattern is the evidence.

I also find is amazing that a Jewish scholar, in Tel Aviv, no less, doesn't believe in the actual events of the Exodus. If that is the case, then the Jews are occupying Palestine on false pretenses. If the Exodus never happened, the Jews have absolutely no claim to that land and yet we have geopolitical mess in Israel today. I would think that Jewish scholars would take this evidence more seriously, as it is their only claim to have been divinely given that land. The miracles of the Exodus, the swiftness of their defeat of existing kingdoms, their prominent rise regionally would all point to divine intervention and MAY give them a historical and supernatural right to the land. Otherwise, they are simply well connected aristocrats to whom the king has appointed a province, in this case Palestine.",1451433600,,1269,4.7681818181818185

As the narrative unfolds, it is clear that no foregone conclusions have been arrived at, and scholars for both a late dating of the exodus and an early dating are fairly represented.  While an argument is made at the end for an early dating, the final conclusion is left to the viewer.  If this movie does not make a compelling argument for early dating, it certainly points out how presuppositions and bias can enter into the interpretation of the evidence.

7272006,3,B00Z9HS8E4,"This documentary is very nicely produced. The scenes are well-composed. The ""author"" always looks serious and thoughtful in his close-ups. The music is well-scored to subtly play on your emotions (as it is in any good movie these days). Even some of the evidence that he presents is fairly interesting.

It's a pity that the author chose to 1) present only evidence that supported his ""pattern"" (i.e., the ""Exodus"" account) and that evidence tailored to support his pattern and 2) not present counter-evidence or explore other patterns that might have fit the evidence just as well.

He presented evidence of a possible exodus of Semites from Egypt. He didn't establish that they were the Proto-Hebrews. He presented evidence of an economic collapse at the end of the a dynasty yet couldn't establish what caused it. There is certainly no evidence of it being caused by the death of every egyptian first-born. He mentioned (I believe) using satellite imaging to track ancient trails through the Sinai Desert. He never mentioned how much evidence would have been left behind by millions of exiles traveling through the desert for 40 years. Remember, none of the original exiles was allowed to enter Canaan. That means millions of skeletons buried in the desert along with the remains of their daily slaughtering of thousands of livestock every day for food and sacrifice (specified in the ""Bible"") and the ecological devastation caused by such a mass of people.

As I remember, he did give off-hand reference to this latter problem by presenting evidence of thousands of Proto-Hebrews leaving Egypt and declining to mention ""millions"". I could be wrong about that.

In short, this is a well-produced movie to make believers feel good about themselves and archeologists and historians tear their hair out at the poor argumentation of the patterns of evidence.",1446422400,6,1857,5.098684210526316

7272033,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"The most revealing aspect of this documentary is the inability of establishment archaeologists to even question their chronology of the Exodus when confronted with the patterns Mr Sorbo revealed. This behavior, called ""confirmation bias"", is frequently observed in the scientific community. Recall the reaction of most cosmologists when the Big Bang Theory was initially proposed or, more recently, that of climate scientists revealed by the Climategate controversy.
I believe Mr Sorbo is on to something here and the dismissive and condescending stance of the archaeologists he interviewed strengthened my belief.",1444694400,,614,5.833333333333333
7272034,2,B00Z9HS8E4,"As an amateur historian, I know when there is sufficient grounds to make an historical claim from evidence and when the claim is ""reaching"", drawing conclusions to fit preconceived notions. This is called ""Confirmation Bias"". Confirmation Bias is a form of selective rationalizing in which someone searches for, interprets, and favors conclusions which corroborate their pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses, while undervaluing and often dismissing the relevance and evidence which might disprove the initial beliefs. Confirmation bias can lead to inappropriate conclusions. In the present context, when ""historians"" to try to prove something they already believe in advance, we should gently question whether their conclusions may be colored by bias. There's a difference between an historian who attempts to find out how Ancient Egyptians and Hebrews lived during Antiquity versus trying to prove the biblical accounts regarding the Hebrews and the Egyptians are true. If they find evidence which might ""fit"" into their overall perspective, and they make claims which rely mostly upon interpretation of the evidence rather than what the evidence itself suggests, this is regarded as borderline or even bad scholarship.

The documentary ""Patterns of Evidence"" seeks to prove whether the Exodus of the Bible is a true event, since the Bible must be taken literally, or so the central figure/narrator claims. (The reading of biblical texts as factual accounts is a gross misunderstanding of the texts.) At the beginning of the documentary, devout Christian filmmaker Tim Mahoney decides to find out if there is evidence to prove the historicity of the Exodus. In the first few minutes, Mahoney travels to the Eastern Mediterranean and meets Manfred Beitak, an Austrian Egyptologist and archaeologist who is excavating an ancient Semite town, Avaris. Mahoney, upon examining the excavation hypothesizes this could be the Israelite settlement given the Pharaoh's blessing in passages relating the life of the Patriarch Joseph of the ""Coat of Many Colors"". Mahoney makes this suggestion to Beitak, and the archaeologist responds that to connect this village with the biblical account is a ""very weak affair"". In other words, Beitak concludes the town of his excavation is probably not the same as the one depicted in the Bible, or at least there's not enough evidence to draw any such conclusions. Mahoney becomes disappointed and the whole experience puts into question his faith, because, as he sees it, the Bible must be true history otherwise his own faith might be based on a ""lie"".

He returns to the United States and then decides to take up the quest again at a more involved level. He begins by finding historians who have alternative theories which match his own beliefs. This is the first major problem with the documentary. Certainly, anyone can find ""historians"" and/or ""scholars"" who have views which contradict mainstream scholarship. While certainly there is nothing wrong with interviewing people who disagree with the larger academic and scholarly community and who voice their disagreements with a different rationale, I felt the documentary was completely unbalanced after Beitak's skepticism. Mahoney only seems to be interested with those scholars on the outside of modern scholarship who wish to make the case that current Egyptian scholarship is ""flawed"" and that the Bible and Egyptian chronology do in fact match but requires a complete rethinking Egyptian history, known as the ""New Chronology"".

Mahoney then states he needs to use a more ""scientific approach"". So, after making this statement, Mahoney first looks at the Bible and then interviews Rabbi Manis Friedman, an orthodox rabbi! This is about as scientific as asking a Roman Catholic bishop about trying to prove the Transubstantiation of the bread into the Body of Christ during Roman Catholic Mass is a scientific reality. Sure, the bishop will offer the current beliefs of the church, but this is above and beyond any kind of scientific inquiry. In a similar vein, the rabbi recounts Exodus and the events as portrayed in the Bible as historically ""true"", which is highly debated by the scholarly community. He then goes on to talk about the divine plan behind these events, which is outside of any kind of scientific approach. While receiving the orthodox account may be relevant to the current question, it is surprising Mahoney would look to the rabbi as his first step in his ""scientific approach"". A PBS documentary on a similar subject would not use a rabbi or a bishop as its first scientific step. They would only be employed to offer the orthodox view.

Shortly thereafter, Mahoney interviews David Rohl, a highly controversial figure in Ancient Egyptian studies. Rohl has proposed a so-called ""New Chronology"", an alternative view of the chronological events and dates of Ancient Egypt. He claims the town of Avaris is called ""The Land of Ramses"" in the Bible, and the confusion comes because a biblical editor at some time used the term ""Land of Ramses"" to depict Avaris. He believes mainstream scholarship is completely incorrect in terms of Egyptian Chronology. While, I have no problem with hearing Rohl's rationale (which would at face value put into question the idea of the Bible as unerring history), there is no counter figure who explains the mainstream view. The only words we get from Beitak at the beginning is that the hypothesis is a ""weak affair"", but we don't hear the rest of the interview as to why he questions Rohl and others who work on the ""outside"".

At Avaris, there has been found the remains of a large statue inside a small pyramid structure of a prominent person, probably a great leader. Now, I do agree, the evidence does suggest the prominent person is a Semite and not an Egyptian because of the hairstyle. However, the documentary wants to prove that this may be in fact Joseph of ""The Coat of Many Colours"" fame from the Bible. They point to some faded paint on the remains of the statue's shoulder which they claim are remains of a depiction of a colored coat! This is really reaching. Some flecks of paint are not enough to jump to the conclusion this is the Coat of Many Colours and therefore Joseph! It could simply be the remains of the depiction of royal robes, since red as a royal color goes back millennium. Also, the documentary says that 12 graves were found near the statue, which could be the 12 tribes of Israel. Yes, it could be, but again, to conclude the existence of twelve graves means that these represent the Twelve Tribes of Israel as fact is a huge leap. If there were Hebrew inscriptions attesting to such, then that would be compelling evidence. As it stands, what we have are the remains of a statue and the remains of twelve graves, which would not be enough to compel academia to concur with Mahoney's hypotheses. The statue remains at Avaris and the conclusions drawn are just a few of the problems with how this documentary is making its claims. There is no evidence outside of interpretation Avaris was an Israelite town once having been led by the Biblical Joseph.

The next issue tackled by Mahoney centers on the Hebrew slaves in Ancient Egypt. We then see some footage from Cecil B. DeMille's silent epic ""The Ten Commandments"" in which hundreds of Hebrews are shown being forced to build the great stone cities and pyramids of ancient Egypt under the whips of the ruthless Egyptians. According to the biblical account, there were hundreds of Hebrew slaves in Egypt living in bondage who are eventually liberated via Moses, but mainstream scholarship doubts this is true. For help on the matter, Mahoney returns again to his old friends Rabbi Friedman and David Rohl, who reiterate the possibility that mainstream scholarship is all wrong. Rohl in particular use very questionable rationalizations to prove their hypotheses. For example, Rohl states the evidence suggests the average lifespan of Hebrews in this period is only 32 to 35, and he concludes this lower age was due to slavery! This is quite ludicrous if not laughable considering, nearly every text I've ever read about Antiquity prior to Jesus of Nazareth, the average lifespan was about 35 years. So the idea that there was a sudden drop in lifespan was due to slavery is another examples of ""confirmation bias"".

According to Robert Brier, perhaps the leading Egyptologist in the world, enslaved Hebrews building Egypt is a Hollywood fallacy. In fact, according to Brier, the workers who built the cities and pyramids were in fact paid contractors, not slaves.  Brier furthers slaves definitely would not have been allowed to touch the stones to construct religious temples and pyramids as these were viewed as sacred and shouldn't be touched by slaves who were probably viewed as ""unclean"". However, this kind of information is exactly the kind of material which is left out of something like this because the filmmakers were engaged in ""confirmation bias"", not wanting to reveal evidence or ideas which might contradict trying to prove the historicity of the Bible.

The issue with this documentary is it takes some evidence, draws some very reaching conclusions, then looks at the Bible, sees if they match, and then decide they corroborate. What they needed were other scholars to explain why some of the conclusions drawn were not accepted by mainstream historians. I am sure people who believe the world is flat could also find a few convincing ""scholars"" who make very convincing arguments about their views. Much of what is presented as ""fact"" is really simply ""opinion"" disguised as fact.",1444694400,9,9627,5.064943253467844
7272035,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"For many of us who do have a faith, yet are educated in the hard sciences, we would like 2 things....evidence if it exists and honesty. Like Mr Mahoney, it seemed incredulous to believe that 2 centuries of archaeology had produced little cohesive evidence as to the migration, settlement, exodus and conquest by the Israelites...little if any.
I like Mahoney had a bit of a crisis and I too came across David Rohl, the avowed agnostic yet archaeologist/egyptologist who put many pieces together in a logical and evidence-based manner. The video production gives a fair, overly fair, presentation of the many archaeologists and scholars who do not hold there is any historical credibility to the Bible and get the video allows, as Eyptologist Mansour states....""let the viewer decide"". The artistry and scope of landscape, spanning 3-4continents, is lavish and the interviews run the wide spectrum from curators to Prime Ministers. It explores not only the archaeological evidence, but the cultural, Biblical, religious and social aspects.

7272052,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"I was aware of claims there was no plausible physical evidence found for the Exodus story. I always thought the story true though, hidden in the mists of time; shrouded by its sheer ancientness.

There are certain inherent improbabilities that spoke against the story as fiction.  For example, so many other ancient peoples and their traditions have disappeared. The Hebrews have a contiguous tradition unbroken as opposed to the cultures of so many other ancient peoples that disappeared,  some of which has been resurrected centuries later (such as some modern re-imaginings of druidism).

Yes, the Hebrews, as Jews are with us still practicing their rituals from the olden days (and the film reminds us of this).  They even reacquired parts of their long lost homeland. Attached to the Bible is the Torah, the first five books of the  Old Testament, and Exodus  becomes a story, not of an obscure tribal myth, but something even the secular world has some casual familiarity with.  When Jesus Christ said , The Scripture cannot be broken (John 10:35), and referred to Scripture as the commandment of God (Matthew 15:3) and as the Word of God (Mark 7:13); the disciples fanned out across the world, the 10 commandments and its accompanying Exodus story was given to that world.

From it the concepts of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, come principles of equality, of all persons before God;  the law and inalienable human rights.

Seems from that viewpoint it is rather calloused to consider the Exodus NOT true.

BACK to the film which conveys with discoveries old and new such physical evidence does INDEED exist.

Part of the point of this documentary is that established Bible skeptics and Egyptologists are ignoring certain pieces of factual evidence  because the Egyptian chronology is itself in in error.  Exodus happened not in the era of Ramses, the established common view, but some 200 years earlier.  The narrator explains this view point logically and plausibly, and in a way that holds interest.  Within 2 hours, he presented understandable evidence, though not exhaustive, but  expansive  leaving  plenty of information to follow up on.

The film also did give consideration to other viewpoints which it used as a springboard to help drive the story along.

Such erroneous Egyptian chronology is also problematic, the film conveys,  for the historicity of other nations and cultures of the region.  This  would be universally reconciled if the Egyptian Chronology were corrected by approximately 200 years.

I would like to know of course what  instances it for what nations these would be  corrected,  nevertheless  web searching ""Egyptian chronology revised,"" yields  very interesting results.

At the end of the day:
If the pattern of evidence is adhered to:
-- and one ignores the established chronology
--there ends up being a pattern within a plausible time frame;
=events and physical evidence consistent with Exodus;  just as the Bible described,",1443744000,2,2979,5.114107883817427
7272053,2,B00Z9HS8E4,Overall an interesting show but for me it was speculative.  It clearly has a bias which takes away from the scientific evidence they propose.  Our failure to find evidence of events from thousands of years ago doesn't mean they didn't happen.,1443657600,4,242,4.878048780487805

7272063,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"I learned awhile ago to just trust what God says. Mostly because he is God and I am not. If he says something happened, then it did whether I saw it, can understand it or can prove. Isn't that what faith is? But I do enjoy watching when science can show evidence that what God said happened, really did happen.

7272064,2,B00Z9HS8E4,"It's definitely a well-produced program, and I'm sure it'll lend comfort to people who need to believe that the Exodus actually happened. The problem I have with this type of show is that the producers carefully pick the evidence that is presented.  For instance, he talks about the middle kingdom city of Avaris in the Nile delta as being where Joseph settled because of evidence of Asiatic people there.  Of course, Asiatic doesn't mean it was Joseph and his brothers.  It's well known by Egyptian scholars that Avaris was the center for Semitic peoples who settled in that area during the middle kingdom.  They were called the Hyksos peoples and we know a tremendous amount about them, unlike what is implied in the documentary.  Associating the Hyksos peoples with the Isrealites has been attempted by many people, and ultimately, scholars have had to reject it.  Not only because the chronology doesn't match the Bible (which it doesn't), but also because, the Hyksos actually became rulers of Egypt (even calling themselves pharoahs) until they were expelled by the Egyptians. Of course, none of this was mentioned in the documentary, and I don't know how people would reconcile this with the Exodus account besides just ignoring it.  And the suggestion that scholars have rejected Exodus as historical simply because of chronology is ridiculous.  Real research requires considering _all_ the evidence, not just the evidence that is convenient to you,  and in my opinion, this is where this fails.  I can't help but watch it and feel that they have already decided on the ending, instead of really wanting to see where all the evidence takes them. Which only makes me wonder what the real story is.",1443225600,6,1704,4.96830985915493

7272068,1,B00Z9HS8E4,"There are many things to say however I will limit myself to two overall, and fatal flaws.  Firstly, there is an unexamined and persistent fundamentalism behind the assertions in the film.  Lumping Israel Finkelstein along with Dawkins, Hitchens and then making them appear as though they say the same thing is absolutely ludicrous. Although this individual's literalism puts him in the realm of an all or nothing thinker, quoting William Propp's discussion in a UCSD conference I will mention shortly, most of us do not fit this mold.  The majority of scholars see no problem understanding the difference between literal history and theology.  In fact the same basic naive assumptions lie behind the individual behind this documentary and those such as Dawkins and Hitchens.  John Haught makes this point in his voluminous discourse around faith and science and I can't recommend his work enough.

The second issue is the lack of engagement with scholarship.  He spends a few sentences on Finkelstein and Bietak, two leading experts in the field of biblical archeology, and leaves it at that.  Obviously if people are saying something that isn't pleasing, they really aren't consulted.  In May of 2013 there was conference on the Exodus at the University of California Davis Campus on the Exodus.  This brought together the best and the brightest in history, archeology, Biblical scholarship, etc, and I invite everyone to spend some times watching those videos, (You can find them on youtube), and contrast them with this documentary.  Quite frankly, the vast majority of scholarship wasn't consulted for this and the obvious conclusion seems to be that the agenda of the documentary overrode the search for truth itself.  For the conference, I would recommend Richard E. Friedman's presentation, however be warned as it requires some familiarity with OT scholarship and source criticism in particular.  For those wanting to now more, I would point people towards Bernard Batto's Slaying the Dragon which presents the Exodus as the ""second act"" of an Israelite origin myth.

As a point of background for myself, I'm a devout Roman Catholic who believes in the Bible, yet someone who believes in the scholarly method.  My thesis for my Master's Degree required a large amount of OT research, thus my familiarity with the topic.  I can understand that people's believes are what they are, and I respect those people, but this is my view of this documentary two issues with it.",1443139200,24,2475,5.104218362282879

If the Bible accurately, factually reports historical (temporal) events and is trustworthy in those matters then it follows that it is likewise trustworthy in eternal matters as well. Every page is about Jesus, every page is God saying ""I love you"" - read it to learn of the extent to which He went so we could be guaranteed an ""exodus"" from Hell itself - He Himself is the way out - His blood shed on our behalf, and He proved this by rising physically, bodily from the grave 3 days later.

There is another pattern - in the Bible - starting in the first 3 chapters of Genesis, going on through the Revelation - of the Gospel ... the Good News of God's grace (getting what we do not deserve) and mercy (not getting what we deserve) toward us.",1442707200,2,881,4.333333333333333

Rather it is a well thought out presentation of evidence that should be seriously considered in the pursuit of truth.  Beliefs should be based on evidence and logic, not blind faith and not on accepted tradition.  Mahoney makes a cogent argument for a revised earlier date of the Exodus.  He also shows why the generally accepted Egyptian chronology may not be correct. He presents substantial archaeological evidence for an Exodus.  He points out that the only reason archaeologists discard this evidence is because it doesn't match the currently accepted timelines of Egyptian history.  He presents an alternative timeline that is worthy of serious discussion.  He interviews the world's top archaeologists on both sides of the debate.

7272077,5,B00Z9HS8E4,Wonderful DVD.  The evidence of the Exodus and other Biblical history is becoming more and more amazing from the archeological research.  I love how the author shows the evidence in such a methodical way.,1442534400,,204,4.970588235294118
7272078,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"I just received this video.  I had ordered it with some hesitation because I once also ordered -- through Amazon -- a recommended ""proof of Exodus"" sort of video and found it to be a sham.

""Patterns of Evidence"" is not that sort of video.

The subject, of course, is intriguing and is part of Judaism, Christianity, and evidently (according to one of the sources in the video) also included in the Qu'ran -- so it is an event that ""matters,"" to some extent to many groups of people.

The narrator/filmmaker has made a lengthy film linking what he finds to be ""patterns of evidence"" pointing to the historicity of the exodus of the Hebrew peoples from Egypt a very long time ago.  Obviously, the event is not noted by signposts in the sand saying ""This is the city of Avaris where the Hebrew slaves  lived and worked,"" and so on. Without that, historians/archaeologists and other interested parties must look for clues (like Sherlock Holmes??) that suggest reality or legend.

I am aware that a nation or people-group can pass down a story faithfully from generation to generation. Folk anthropologists among the ancient Hawaiians, New Zealanders, Mayans and more have found that, IF a people wanted to, they could pass a story down ""with word for word accuracy"" --that phrase was the most amazing part!! -- if they wanted to.

Of course, it does not mean that what they have passed down is true, unless, of course, you really DO believe in Balder the Elder, or etc. It just means that they COULD.

I did some family-history work on one of my family surnames and discovered along the way that the old story of French Huguenot descent was not just something my father had told me, but that everyone with that surname who is remotely related to me -- has also heard that account; and some wonky  tenth cousin actually did the footwork and found it legitimate. SO -- if a single family can pass a story down for 500 years, cannot a nation?  A Native American activist, in one of his books, set out to demonstrate that some Native American stories -- thousands of years older than the Exodus event -- were accounts--accurately passed down -- of legitimate geological occurrences.

And much of this thinking would be behind any expectation that a search for  ""patterns of evidence"" could actually point to the biblical Exodus. As one historian  said in  the film, why would anyone tell a story about their national origins in slavery?  Believe me -- no one I have met doing family history is looking for THAT sort of genesis, either -- though surprises and shocks do come when studying ancestors' lives.

The filmmaker has interviewed a wide range of people -- an agnostic,  a rabbi who believes the whole story, a rabbi who believes none of it, minimalist archaeologists, maximalist archaeologists, people with high credentials in the field of Near Eastern archaeology, and people with more of an interest than a five-star background. His selection of items for his ""patterns"" is interesting. I can see that I have read SOME of it elsewhere --- for ex., James Hoffmeier (who is interviewed several times in the movie) demonstrates in his own books the presence of various ""patterns of evidence,"" such as the increasing number of Semitic peoples in New Kingdom Egypt..

There are some items that I will have to think or read more about -- or re-read. I was not too sure about his use of the work of Kathleen Kenyon re Jericho. I know she did not believe in a biblical Exodus and her findings at Jericho disappointed those who were looking for a Cecil B. deMille set (""with a cast of thousands""). Kenneth Kitchen, a conservative Egyptologist, said in one of his books that ""there is far too much imagination"" exercised over what the actual fall-of-Jericho might have looked like.

But that is why this film is a film that gives everyone ""something to think about."" He does give you an honest day's work for an honest day's wage in terms of presentation, flow of story, range of interviews,  production, etc. But you have to do the rest of the work -- look into the details, consider other arguments -- on your own.

The film has been rightly critiqued by some on these boards for scoffing too easily at the ""prejudices"" of archaeologists who deny the Exodus out of hand or say it could not have been at the time period that this filmmaker proposes because Ramesses HAD to have been the Pharoah of the Exodus.  If the latter is their only reason, then I would say they are a bit too dogmatic, but they may have other reasons for their objections. Do they? We are not told.

A fascinating period of ancient near eastern history -- the whole era of the New Kingdom (or Middle, if you are looking there). I have seen other comments made by people on these boards comparing Moses to Akhenaten and saying Moses plagiarized the Law Codes of Hammurabi. These are not issues that are part of the documentary film.  Others, elsewhere, have said Moses could not have been Akhenaten (wrong century, for starters, and while Akhenaten WAS a monotheist, it seems Moses' views may have evolved over time) and that the Law Codes not only may not have been original to Hammurabi (in other words, it was not MOSES who did the plagiarizing!!) but they were more concerned with property rights while the Mosaic laws focused on individual rights.

As I said -- the film will give everyone something to think about! Enjoy!!",1442534400,19,5394,4.681481481481481

The writer/reporter decided to investigate the reality of the Exodus of Moses and the Hebrews based on archaeological evidence presented to him by contemporary and past archaeologists.  He interviewed those who claim the reality of the biblical and historical Exodus and those who refute the evidence as having anything to do with the supposed historical and/or biblical story of the Exodus. He thinks outside of the box in relation to his investigative methods.  The writer/reporter is a Believer but I'm not sure if he is a Jew or a Christian.  It doesn't really matter but his presupposition is his belief since as a child, that the story of the Exodus was true.  He said that he decided to follow the evidence regardless of which way it went and I believe him.  I believe him because if there is a God, and He wants to be known to us, He will make a way.  If there is no God then their would be no evidence to follow and it would just be random coincidences that had no thread to them.  He leaves you to judge for yourself but he does give his own conclusion.  It isn't a shove it down your throat kind of a documentary.  I recommend it to everyone.",1442448000,2,1210,4.454545454545454

And then they show how the Egyptian timeline is wrong and needs to be adjusted, so they move it forward on the wall of time. And then the biblical events match up perfectly with the Egyptian events, and it all makes sense. I love the 3D animation of Joseph's pyramid tomb.

7272115,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This is an extremely interesting and balanced documentary.  The basic thesis is that those archaeologists who claim that there is no evidence to support the story of the Israelite journey to, enslavement in, and exodus from Egypt are basing their assumptions on an incorrect timeline.  Indeed, if  one assumes that the Exodus occurred during the reign of Ramses II in the New Kingdom (about 1250 B.C.), there is no evidence.  However, if you move the timeline back a couple of hundred years and date the Exodus to about 1450 B.C., there is A LOT of evidence!  The filmmaker, Tim Mahoney, interviews many people on both sides of the issue, but there is no question that there is evidence for a Semitic person who came to Egypt and rose to be a great advisor to Pharoah (similar to Joseph in the Bible), for the arrival of many more Semitic people from Syria-Palestine who may have become enslaved, for their exodus from Egypt, and for their conquest of Jericho and later all of Canaan (what the Bible calls ""The Promised Land."")  Now, all of this does not mean that the Bible story is true, but it DOES mean that those who say there is no evidence to support what is in the Bible are dead wrong.",1441411200,,1194,4.55607476635514

It was a very informative and unbiased representation of the archeological facts. It has only been one generation since mainstream archeology and popular opinion began teaching that the Bible is not an Historical account, yet the evidence is there--we've just been looking in the wrong place. As they said in the film, true science presents all the known evidence to the public and lets the public decide what is true.""  That is exactly what this film does. There is a mountain of archeological evidence that supports the Biblical account of the Exodus; we just have to be willing to see it.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone--Christians, Jews, biblical-skeptics, and historians. It is very well put together and does an excellent job of presenting the facts.

Mahoney, the filmmaker, is an ordinary, plump chum, like you and me. His genius is simple: he presents both sides of the story on a topic dominated by one side, and thus blindsides us with an opinion we thought no longer existed. He lets the other side counter. Obviously, those who are serious about the topic will need to dig deeper.

Mahoney opens the door for those who have been shut up by one dominating position to present their amazing argument for the historicity of the biblical story. By doing so, Mahoney gently exposes the absurd faith our society has placed in our scholars and scientists. I am angry at myself for my own blind faith in our scholars, but I'm also angry at the academic community for their own arrogance, cowardice, and closed mindedness. Intelligent arguments used for decades to diss biblical narratives come across as ridiculous in this documentary. That is what makes Patterns of Evidence so great. It is simple, but amazing. In its own way, this movie is a David and Goliath story.  Mahoney, the chum, facing off against the giant minds of our era. The ordinary ol' guy nailed it with this movie.
p.s. There is one more aspect to Mahoney's style that needs mentioning: he listens. He really listens to and respects each opinion.",1441065600,3,1421,4.795918367346939

7272142,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Pretty breathtaking documentary.  I'm a Christian of very traditional faith, but I've developed a real wariness of Christian-produced documentaries in regard to  history and archeology.  My university education was in history, logic, and debate, so a good deal of my training was in how to spot logical or evidentiary holes in an argument.  Unfortunately, many Christian documentaries contain huge skip-overs of contrary historical and archeological evidence in pursuit of a predetermined conclusion -- a highly selective ""pick-and choose"" consideration of the evidence.  In logic, this is known as a circular argument.  It assumes as a given (that the Bible is historically factual) the very thing that is to be proved (that the Bible is historically factual).  If you start from that assumption, then naturally you're going to present only the evidence that supports what you have assumed as a given.  The premise predetermines the conclusion.  That is circular reasoning.  This documentary is unique in two respects: 1) It starts from a relatively neutral point of view and gives respectful hearing to roughly equivalent numbers of both skeptics and proponents of Biblical historicity.  2) It shows that the current mainstream view of archeologists and Egytologists in regard to the the Exodus account is entirely predicated on the given assumption that the story must be dated to the reign of Ramesses II in the Late Kingdom, around 1250 BC, in which there is no historical or archeological evidence for the Exodus.  But if the timeline is shifted about two centuries earlier, around 1450 BC under under the reign of Thotmose II or Thotmose II (and the mother-regent Hapshetsut) during the Middle Kingdom, there is ample historical and archeological evidence that does fit with the Exodus story.  So in effect, the majority of ancient historians and Egyptologists have engaged in a huge circular argument of their own: The roughly 1250 BC dating of the Exodus account is a given, a fixed fact, with no real accounting for the historical/archeological evidence for an earlier date of around 1450 BC.  Again, the premise predetermines the conclusion.  Circular reasoning.  No historical/acheological scholar approaches the research without personal biases or predispositions of his own, which highly colors how he interprets the evidence.  But this documentary comes closer than any I've seen at adopting a fairly neutral starting point, giving fair hearing to both pro an con positions, and then simply following the evidence where it leads.",1440374400,12,2544,5.335839598997493

I liked the positive and negative views of the scholarly interviewees because it showed that not every scholar is happy with the ideas presented in the presentation, indicating that further research is needed concerning the period in which the Exodus happened. There seems to be no shortage of skeptics that the Exodus never happened. That makes sense since not everyone believes in the Bible. Some people hate the Bible and any evidence favoring the truth of the Bible.

The Jewish people have been the butt-end of several persecutions and ended up in captivity. I wouldn't be surprised if some skeptics deny the Babylonian captivity also didn't happen. There are people who deny Jesus and Paul ever existed, the Genesis flood never happened, but I have read books by those who provide good evidence to the contrary.

History and science are fluid subjects.  There is never an absolute chronology because there is so much still to be discovered and as these discoveries are made, then the timeline is refined.  As scientists, we should never be so locked into such a rigid timeline that everything else is dismissed.  The duty of historians and scientists is to discover and refine.  I don't agree that Egyptian timeline should be so overwhelmingly used to date other civilizations.  Egypt is a work in progress.  There have been other scientists from fields, such as, geology to find evidence that Egypt is much older than what is accepted and were ridiculed for their findings.

The Stela of Hammurabi is well known in the Study of Archaelogy and has an older set of commandments , thus leading scholars to conclude that either these commandments were well known throughout the area or Writers of Exodus borrowed them to fit what they were constructing.  It is also possible that Akenaton was the original Moises or inspiration, we know as a fact that his name was stricken from the walls and his monuments hidden.  The biblical Moises was an amalgamation of various people during a long stretch of Hyskos and Sea Peoples in Egypt.

""Patterns of Evidence Exodus"" by Filmmaker Timothy P. Mahoney is an in depth documentary into the existence of the Exodus of the Israelite slaves from Egypt. Relying on the experience of archaeologists, scientists, curators and biblical scholars, Mr. Mahoney takes a 12 year journey around the world in search of the truth of the Exodus. Many say that the archaeological record is completely opposed to the Bible's account.

The documentary is narrated by Kevin Sorbo (God's Not Dead, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys) and filled with interviews from leading archeologists, Egyptologists and biblical scholars.  It will open your eyes  historical facts that may challenge your traditional view of history.

I love how the documentary breaks up the search for the truth of the Exodus into different periods and then does a quick summary of each.  My five year old daughter, decided that she  wanted to sit with me as well and was captivated by the section on the ""Battle of Jericho"".  (It is one of her favourite stories).  The documentary presents so much information that it has potential to be confusing and boring, instead Mr. Mahoney presents the information in an easy to understand format that will keep you watching and wanting more.

I can only imagine being on this journey of truth myself.  The emotions that must have been felt as each piece of evidence was found. ""Patterns of Evidence Exodus"" compares the story of the Bible to known facts and leaves it up to you, the viewer, to make the decision on your belief as to whether the Exodus is fact or fiction.  For anyone who enjoys watching documentaries, this is one to put on the top of your list.

7272185,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This documentary is very well done.  I felt Timothy was very humble and honest in seeking the answers.  I felt he didn't go into it with preconceived notions, but with faith and hope of what he may find and open to what could be out there.  He didn't leave out important archaeologists because they didn't agree with Exodus having happened, he welcomed hearing from many experts.  Even though, I'm sure, he was discouraged at different points during this process, he continued his search.

I don't feel the documentary was created to sway viewers one way or another.  Timothy does make it clear he is a Christian, but all the evidence is shared in a way that allows the viewer to come to their own educated conclusion.  Religion is one of those subjects we are always told never to speak of, or at least I was, all the time by my mother growing up.  I feel even that is contrary to what we are taught as Christians, which is to share our faith.  Timothy didn't come off at all as preachy or pushy.  He was determined to seek the truth and I believe he found it.  I appreciate his hesitance to be involved in something controversial, but applaud his efforts to uncover the truth of such a big part of our faith history.

I don't want to give too much away, because I believe this is a documentary that everyone should watch.  It is about 2 hours in length, but it didn't feel that way when watching it, it felt shorter and I can only attribute that to the way it was presented.  I really appreciated Timothy's use of visual aid, when sharing the timeline.  It really helped me to understand a complex concept, which is good for those of us that lack the knowledge that archaeologists have.

It is so amazing to me to see what has been uncovered through out history, the amount of knowledge, work, and experience that goes into something like creating a timeline of the world's history.  It was interesting to hear the thoughts of many people, especially a Jew, who doesn't believe Exodus is true, but in his private life, lives out the Passover, like it really did happen, exactly as the Bible says it does.  It showed that, there is probably some part of him, that believes Exodus is true, despite his professional opinion.

I can't say it enough, it really is a MUST watch.  ""Knowledge is power"" - Francis Bacon.  With knowledge we can better communicate our beliefs, our faith, our history.  Even if you disagree with every single thing in the documentary, watching it will give you the knowledge to debate it with intelligence of the ""other side"".

7272187,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Thank you FlyBy for this review copy.
What's true for you may not be true for me. If it feels good, do it. It doesn't matter what you believe as long as you believe something. Tolerance. The nonsense goes on and on. If you listen to it too long, it might make sense to you. If it makes sense to you, then you lose the sense of everything. Jesus Christ said himself that He is the way, the truth, and the life. No man comes to the father except through him. (John 14:6) There's one way to God, only one way.

In this age of moral relativism, some Christians believe only certain parts of the Bible. Paul said, ""All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."" (2 Timothy 3:16) If we start picking and choosing what we want to believe, that brings the whole Bible into question.

When Filmmaker Timothy Mahoney started questioning the historical validity of the Exodus, he found himself questioning his Christian beliefs. This lead to an intense, twelve year research project to investigate whether there was in fact any archaeological evidence to support the biblical, historical account. This film is the result of that quest for truth.

~ My Thoughts ~
I came to this documentary with with a strong faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Jesus Christ. I believe the Bible to be completely true.
Mr. Mahoney took a very scientific, practical, hands on approach to the project.
To the best of his ability, I think he kept his mind open during his research.
He examined the the biblical account in detail.
He spoke to experts around the world, archaeologists, historians, Jewish leaders, and theologians.
He examined, with the help of a Jewish rabbi, the original Hebrew text.
The photography and cinematography were outstanding.
I intend to watch it again with my teenagers.
A remarkable case for the proper timing of the events was made.
I found this to be a fascinating documentary. I give it five stars.",1438732800,2,2010,4.7371428571428575
7272188,5,B00Z9HS8E4,The best Bible Documentary my husand and I have watched! Well done. Professional. Thought provoking. Open-ended.,1438732800,,112,6.0625
7272189,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This is an amazing investigative movie. It has one many awards and investigates the event in the Bible called the Exodus. Most mainstream scholars have declared that there is no evidence that there ever was an Exodus. They believe that many stories in the Bible are just myths. Patterns of Evidence: The Exodus challenges this assumption by revealing a completely different interpretation.

The film took 12 years to make and uncovers an amazing pattern of evidence that matches the biblical events of Exodus and Conquest. I saw this movie in the theater and would be buying it right now if I hadn't just been given it. I can't wait to watch it again and share it with my friends.",1438732800,,680,4.714285714285714
7272190,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This Movie brings together all the doubters {ie Archeologists] as to the existence of an Exodus by the Jewish people. The rationale explanation is that by looking at diggings of Avaris {under an area named in the Bible, Rameses], found are connections to Goshen, as well as to Joseph, the 12 tribes, the killing off under 2 years olds, human slavery. There is NO doubt that there was an Exodus.
Since the writer, Tim Mahoney goes to my church, let if be known, that there is another DVD coming out in the next 10 years, that will focus on where the JEWS crossed the RED SEA.
Mr. Mahoney, who I know as an acquaintance, is very thorough in his research. I first heard of this project in 2007. It was placed on hold for a few years to review and verify what was to be in the Original 2007 version.
The movie moves along very rapidly, and scenery is beautiful. {Note, if I were to criticize anything, it is a very long show, so you want to see it in 2 nights.]",1438732800,2,957,4.263736263736264
7272191,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"I love documentaries and more so ones that are historical. Add in the fact that its Biblical History its even better.

I watched this with my family. I found it fascinating and informative. It was a bit over the head for my 9 and 12 year old.

A Pattern of Evidence Exodus DVD is 119 minutes long. It covers an intriguing question on whether the Bible is a myth and why do the archaeological records dispute the Biblical account especially with the lack of evidence from the book of Exodus with the Israelites slavery and leaving Egypt. He points out that perhaps the time period we have always perceived the Exodus happening in is earlier than we thought. Are you interested yet?

Wow, this amazed me as I never knew that the archaeological records dispute the Biblical account. I mean I take the word of God literal and so beyond a shadow of doubt would I question it.

Unfortunately, others don't believe the Bible if there isn't physical proof. Timothy Mahoney approaches the fact by science using a scientific approach. It frustrates me that men who proclaim Jesus can say that the story of Exodus is a myth!

The graphics and scenery is amazing and makes the documentary that much better. I love looking at history and seeing where it happened. The interviews are very intriguing and are interviews from both sides of the dispute.

I learned a lot with Patterns of Evidence Exodus. I highly recommend this documentary. You won't be disappointed.

7272192,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"This film lays out evidence for the Exodus account and also addresses the reasons why this evidence is often overlooked or ignored. But not just second hand information. He goes straight to the various ""experts"" and asks them their thoughts on the evidence that is found. I have to admit that I laughed at some of the reasons for dismissing the information although I don't think it was intended to be funny. Just astounding how much of the evidence is ignored without any real logical explanation. And while our faith is ""faith"", it was very edifying to see the amount of  archaeological evidence that is so often ignored. Highly recommend!",1438732800,7,641,4.827272727272727
7272193,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Patterns of Evidence: Exodus is a very well-rounded film in the fact that he speaks to several different people, and not all of them agree with history of the Bible. I'm really glad that I chose to watch this with my husband and eight-year old. It's way to advanced for our four year old so he listened as he played with Legos. How do I know he listened? He would ask a question or talk about what was maybe just mentioned in the film.  It's not only a great family film, but a fantastic learning opportunity as well.  It is a long movie so we did end up breaking it up into two nights.  I knew if we didn't break it up, I would definitely lose our eight year old by the end.

7272194,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"I've never been so enthusiastic about a documentary! I love history, the Bible, and archeology, and to find them all on one DVD was great! The quality of the filming, the animations, reenactments, and the way the entire subject was handled, were quite impressive.

As I watched things I'd read years ago came back to mind and I was excited to learn so many new  facts. Most of the archaeological finds mentioned were totally new to me. An entire treasure trove of history, history that supports the Bible, was opened up before me.
The film is told in such a way that layman can easily understand and it would be a great homeschool supplement.

One of the things I really appreciated, though, was how the filmmaker drew information and even opinions from such diverse people. From Egyptologists and archaeologists to world leaders from Israel. Christian and agnostic. Those who believe the Biblical account is accurate and those who don't. Ultimately it is a search for the truth.

I really enjoyed Patterns Of Evidence and you can bet that I will be watching it more than once. It is one of those rare films that I know I'll be able to take away something different each time I watch it.

7272196,5,B00Z9HS8E4,"Is there archaeological evidence of the Biblical Exodus as an actual historical event? Watch this movie and decide for yourself. The film maker doesn't push his opinion, he just presents evidence and a time line. Opposing opinions are given equal time and credence. But, this film is especially heartening for those who do believe the Bible, and the evidence presented will give them plenty to think about.",1438646400,9,406,5.074626865671642

7272198,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"I always hesitate when I hear something is a documentary, but the subject material did fascinate me. Although my faith is exactly that---faith, it is interesting to see what experts have to offer in claims that either reject or validate Biblical history. Patterns of Evidence is not a great documentary, but it is better than most have I have seen. The music was a great complement to the film rather than the distraction I find in many docs or lengthy news pieces, so that is a great plus for me.

Also, I loved hearing from a variety of sources. Not all archaeologists who were interviewed agreed that the Exodus actually took place. It is always good to hear dissenting views to gain a full picture. There were also elements of story-telling used that enhanced the evidence being presented. There were moments when it dragged or the cutaways to serious (or puzzled) faces caused a bit of an eyeroll reaction in me, but not a huge issue. Also, nice narration by Kevin Sorbo. I will watch it again and definitely see a use for this in teaching others about Judeo-Christian history.

I think that level of timeline error is not a serious problem in the nature of scientific messiness, especially for times in the distant past, but skeptics often use it to cast doubt on the inspiration of scripture. The video slowly and systematically pursues answers with success at showing plausibility. The precision of the text is validated in the pursuit.",1532304000,,490,5.061728395061729
8719636,4,B00Z9HS8E4,"I saw what the early direction of this film was. Hard hitting evidence exists for Noah's Ark - 7 ft anchorstones, 515 ft long boat with petrified/laminated wood, etc., The Red Sea Crossing - 8 spoked chariot wheels, bones, etc., Mt. Sinai - 12 pillars, the altar of the golden calf, and blackened peak have all been found. A good film, but not the best evidence that is out there. There is a revelation upon the mercy seat of the Ark of the Covenant. Something so big, many will not be able to handle it. You can handle the truth, if you humble yourself before Yahweh. In Yahshua's name I pray that you will ask, seek, and knock. It will be opened to you if you do so...",1531872000,,670,4.2421875

I  have seen 4 or 5 presentations of the Exodus and this is up there with the best of them. the Joseph stuff alone is worth the money. Yes, it has nay-saying academics in it, but it has Rohl and other competent people, too.  Don't miss this one. it is not an anti-bible presentation.
