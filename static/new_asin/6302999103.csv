Off to a flying start,that is,with a film of such staggering ineptitude it fairly beggars belief. Borrowing shamelessly from the premise of Barbet Schroeder's ""Single White Female"",this film,which is yet to have a DVD release,features not only the late Margaux Hemingway giving it her gap-toothed all (which,let's face it,was always cringe-inducing at best!),but also a laughable script,ham-fisted direction by Eduardo Montes,as well as a humiliating cameo from the once-promising Frederic Forrest. Hence,a must-have for celluloid atrocity afficianados everywhere. Even if,at time of writing,available only on VHS.So seek and ye shall be amused...trust me!!",1374364800,,770,5.823008849557522
7833384,4,6302999103,Many films find their best ally in time. This curious flick so representative of the 1980's B-movie frenzy will definitely find his way as a cult movie for a few. I enjoyed watching Frederic Forest again.,1299024000,3,204,4.694444444444445
7833385,1,6302999103,"Midway through, ""Double Obsession"" begins to reek of ""Misery,"" when Heather cripples one of her objects of adoration, holds her hostage, and then commits assorted nasties against assorted  interlopers. But there's no comparing the sad ""Double Obsession""  with the masterful ""Misery."" There are no characters here, only  caricatures -- everyone is either psycho or insists on hanging out with  psychos, but we have no idea why. Even ""Misery""'s truly psychotic  Annie Wilkes was more believable. (And more sympathetic.) The soundtrack,  by turns, steals suspense and turns suspense into goofiness. And Heather's  ""psycho laugh"" is from Hitchcock by way of Bugs Bunny. If this  weren't a feature-length film with professional sets and actors, I'd think  it came from a high-school film class.
I really hate writing this, 'cause  I know Beth Fisher (Sherry). I'm sure it was the director's fault, Beth.  8o) Write me and I'll apologize to you directly!",963532800,3,948,5.295302013422819
