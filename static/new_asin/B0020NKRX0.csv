3830471,5,B0020NKRX0,"Henry Poole is here, is a fantastic heart felt film, made with love, and a lot of style. Simply from a film makers view point this movie is a masterpiece. The lighting, and photography are far above the average film. At points the action in the movie breaks down almost into a music video, and that is a good thing. This movie is in no way a comedy, yet does have comedic touches. The creators were looking for a modern day Jimmy Stewart, and in Luke Wilson I think they found one. The rest of the cast is truly great, each actor bringing a major amount of skill to their role. The movie is about going beyond the pain, and suffering that life presents, and finding hope when you don't believe there is any. There is a  heightened sense of magic in this film, and it is on my list as one of my favorite movies of all time. So if you enjoy well made, intelligent, loving films don't miss this one. It sure doesn't hurt to have Luke Wilson in it. Radha Mitchell deserves a mention before I go. She was also outstanding in this movie. This two disc DVD is neat-o some of the music in the movie was very good. So getting an audio CD of the music, as a gift is funkadelic. As is often the case the music on the CD is by the bands featured in the movie, and not the actual Soundtrack Score. Which was excellent as well.",1251158400,2,1313,4.149019607843138

The morose, depressed, and seemingly even suicidal Henry Poole (Luke Wilson) purchases a house in the suburbs and makes cryptic comments about how he's not going to live there long. Is he sick/terminal? Is he suicidal? Is he just going to flip the house? An image appears on the back of his garage wall which his neighbor Esperanza Martinez (Adriana Barraza) says is the Face of Jesus. Henry thinks it's just a stain from a bad stucco job. Is it miraculous or easily explained away as just a merely human oddity? This sets up a movie in which a number of interesting characters emerge and a number of serious life issues ranging from family-of-origin issues, to abandonment, to terminal illness, to hopelessness, to unbelief, to belief, are examined. Despite the heavy subject matter, there are a number of humorous moments. Adriana Barraza as Esperanza Martinez is excellent as a little church lady, suffering a life of much loneliness, but also constantly praying for others and deeply concerned about their welfare in a motherly way.

There are a few pointed anti-belief/anti-faith statements made, such as when Henry makes a comment about how he doesn't want ""you (Esperanza) and your crazy church friends"" in his backyard staring at his wall.

There's  also a shot at atheism when one of Esperanza's friends makes the comment that Henry the ""atheist"" is ""not very nice"" and that ""The two (atheism and meanness) go hand in hand.""

But for the most part the movie is evenhanded towards faith and skepticism, belief or unbelief, and lets the viewer decide.

The movie features an excellent soundtrack with both classic and original songs.

The movie also features the following quote of Noam Chomsky which Patience (Rachel Seiferth), a supermarket cashier, speaks to Henry in one of their interesting verbal encounters:

""When questions of decision, reason, or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.""
*****************************************************************************Spoiler Alert*****************************************************************************
Henry's next door neighbor is Dawn Stupek (Radha Mitchell), a divorcee/single mother whose 6-year-old daughter Millie (Morgan Lily) doesn't speak. She hasn't spoken for about a year, since her father left. One night at 3AM, Dawn gets up to find that Millie is not in her room. She begins calling out for her and then goes outside to see Millie in Henry's backyard, about to touch the image on his wall. As she touches the image and Dawn comes over to her, we see in Millie's blue eyes a mixture of tears, relief, and healing. And then she speaks for the first time in a year. These are quite moving scenes and the highlight of the movie, in my opinion. The cute Morgan Lily is a scene-stealer. These scenes reminded me of the scenes in ""Patriot"" in which Mel Gibson's character's son finally speaks.",1495843200,,2893,5.2064516129032254

8348558,5,B0020NKRX0,This movie is a real sleeper. I had only read about it and knew I had to watch it. The cast worked for minimum union scale because the budget was low and they so believed in and wanted to make this movie. I had a copy at one point but loaned it out and never got it back. Glad I wanted to replace it because this version came with the soundtrack which is also excellent.,1465430400,,370,3.9466666666666668

8348562,5,B0020NKRX0,I found this movie by chance. Luke Wilson plays a different role than his usual characters. The movie takes on a serious issue with some sadness and light hearted comedy combined.,1405209600,2,179,4.806451612903226
8348563,4,B0020NKRX0,"When I saw the previews at the theatre, I wanted to see this movie ... but I missed it. I rented it and wasn't sure what I thought afterward. However, it kept coming to my mind ... and I'm a fan of several in the cast. I decided to buy it and the CD because I enjoyed the music, too. This would be a good movie for a group to view together and discuss. I'd recommend it because it's thought provoking and it's very well done; it could have been kind of campy but it wasn't.",1255132800,4,473,3.9375
8348564,5,B0020NKRX0,"Director Mark Pellington's ""Henry Poole Is Here"" is a gem, a low-key, wonderful tale of redemption (both spiritual and physical), miracles (don't worry, the film is not preachy!), and of characters you can actually care about. A first-rate cast (headed by the very effective Luke Wilson) gives a terrific ensemble performance, and this film is definitely a keeper!

The screenplay (by Albert Torres) is deceptively simple; a dying man (Wilson) returns to his old neighborhood to drink away his last days in solitude, but when a busybody neighbor (Adriana Barraza) interprets a stain on the stucco wall of his house as an image of Christ, he gets a lot of unwanted attention! Despite his complete skepticism, his neighbors come to observe the 'Miracle', and he gradually develops a bond with a young mother and daughter (Radha Mitchell and Morgan Lily), devastated by their abandonment by her husband. He stubbornly clings to his belief that all that is on his wall is a stain, even when blood appears on it, and the local priest (a very subdued George Lopez) tries to convince him otherwise. Then the miracles begin...

What really makes this film 'work' so well, is that it doesn't attempt to force-feed morality or religious dogma; it is a story about simple, sympathetic people, all suffering some degree of loss, who find comfort and healing through the people they come in contact with; the image serves as a catalyst, but it is the giving and sharing of love that really brings about miracles in these people's lives. This is the film's lesson, and it's told with humor and kindness, elements sadly lacking in most current films.

""Henry Poole Is Here"", being a low-budget 'indie', didn't get a lot of attention when it was released, but it is a truly special film, that will warm your heart!",1254355200,4,1798,4.869281045751634
