1623162,5,B00005LQ0C,"Wow. I watched this movie expecting to maybe not finish it. This story has never been told before as far as I know. The black and white heightened the effect of the movie. Poor Dorothy. My friends liked it like I did, both men and women. When we talked about it after the movie, but we all liked and cringed at different places. What a fun discussion we had afterwards. Not for children and probably not for all adults. If you have a weak stomach this might not be for you, but it is fun. I very much recommend this movie for people that are not looking for the same story that we've all seen over and over again.",1077580800,10,613,4.159663865546219
1623163,1,B00005LQ0C,"This is definitely not a ""feel-good"" gay movie.. its a glimpse of a sick and twisted person exploiting a drug addict for his pleasure. Not a movie you walk away from feeling good about seeing it.",1042761600,5,195,4.444444444444445
1623164,5,B00005LQ0C,"Its hard believe this award-winning film didn't get more exposure. A darkly comic and disturbing tale of sexual frustration and physical and mental abuse. It may not sound like ""fun"" but this film is deeply captivating. Hopefully it will get more exposure now that it is on DVD.",1005177600,14,278,4.8125
1623165,5,B00005LQ0C,"The first feature film by Kevin Dinovis... who wrote, directed, edited, and starred in this haunting portrayal of eerie co-dependence. As Trevor, actor Peter Prior gives a startingly disturbing performance of a man driven to destruction due to his fear of women. Dinovis, who plays Lahn/Dorothy, turns in a obsessively needy drug-addled performance.
If you like your movies dark, twisted, edgy, sexually gritty, and with an ending that allows you to draw your own conclusions... this one is definitely for you.",995500800,20,510,5.308641975308642
7944311,5,B00005LQ0C,"I HAVE BEEN PREACHING/TALKING/TEACHING .....ABOUT THIS PHASE OF LIFE THAT WE ALL FACE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER.
I CALL IT '''''RECONCILING.....YOUR REAL LIFE AND WITH YOUR DREAM LIFE.'''''  AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND IT TAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE EDGE.  SOME FALL OFF THE EDGE AND HAVE TO CRAWL BACK INCH BY INCH.  EVERYONE DOES NOT USE DRUGS OR ALCOHOL IN THE PLIGHT TO OLDER STAGES OF DEVELOPENT ....BUT SOME DO.  IT IS HARD.  IT IS MISERABLE.  YOU FEEL LIKE A LOOSER BUT THIS IS WHERE THE CULTURE YOU'VE GROWN UP WITH WILL HELP A LOT OR MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT YOU FEEL ALL ALONE.  IT WILL EITHER MAKE YOU STRONGER OR EVEN MORE BROKEN.

A YOUNG WOMAN TOLD ME HER STORY.  WHAT HAPPEN TO HER IN HER WORLD...WHAT HER FATHER''S BEST FRIEND DID TO HER WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD DURING A FAMILY GATHERING AND SHE FOUND HERSELF INSIDE THE HOUSE ON HER WAY GOING BACK OUTSIDE.  SHE WAS GRABBED AND HANDLED.  SHE HAD TO REALLY STRUGGLE TO GET FREE.  NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED BEFORE PEOPLE WERE HEARD COMING INTO THE HOUSE.  SO, IT WAS LIKE....WAS THE POLICE CALLED?  NO!  THE POLICE WAS ALREADY THERE IN THE FORM OF THE MOLESTER.  HE WAS A COP, A LEIUTENANT--TOTALLY TRUSTED.

RECENTLY, AT 50, HER FATHER DIED NEVER KNOWING  THAT HIS BEST FRIEND (FOREVER)  HAD ATTACKED HIS 8YR. OLD DAUGHTER AND HIS WIFE,TOO ....AT A DIFFERENT TIME.  HE DIED NOT KNOWING THIS HAD HAPPENED TO HIS FAMILY.  NOW  THAT DADDY IS GONE AND MOM IS GONE AS WELL....THIS YOUNG WOMAN
 MAY/ CAN/ SOMETIMES DOES INCLUDE THESE INCIDENCES IN HER GRIEF AND MOURNING AND GET HER WIRES ALL TANGLED.  SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS.  LIKE, SAY FIVE FAMILY DEATHS OCCUR, NO MOURNING, THEN DECADES LATER AND A SIX DEATH AND SOME PEOPLE WILL GO BACK TO NUMBER 1.  (NOT BY CHOICE, BUT IT OCCURS IN THE INNER WORLD IN OUR MIND, BODY AND SOUL.

THIS YOUNG WOMAN BECAME AN ADMINISTRATOR OF A LARGE LAW FIRM.  SO.  SHE TURNED OUT STRONG AND IT IS HER SELF-STRENGTH THAT HELPS HER COME BACK FROM DARK ENERGY.

*THIS PRODUCTION HAS '''REAL''' MERITS.  IT CAN BE OF HELP TO SOME PEOPLE BUT STILL, THE WORK HAS TO BE DONE.
*BUT AT LEAST WE CAN KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE.  WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE.  *LIFE STORIES HAVE A LOT OF PAIN & SORROWS.  WE MUST SURVIVE THEM ALL.

GOSH!!!!!.....THAT GUY WHO LOVES HER WAS SO CUTE AND BIG AND FABULOUSLY MALE AND MAN.  I LOVED HIM MYSELF..  HIS PERFORMANCE WAS FABULOUS.  BUT CHECK THIS OUT:  HE HAD ISSUES TOO.....BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN I CAME ALONG YOUNG YOU COULDN'T PAY A GUY TO APPEAR VUNERABLE TO ''''FEELINGS''''.

7944312,3,B00005LQ0C,"Acting in general is fairly good, Jill Saunders as Dory Mason is good when she is high on alcohol, otherwise not credible sometimes. A little above the average acting were Dr. Marilyn Hall and Therapist #3. The final scene between Dory and her ex-lover seemed faky,",1481068800,,265,4.782608695652174
7944313,5,B00005LQ0C,"Loved the film! This is the first time I see Miller's work. It starts as a comedy but it can soon be tagged as a science fiction, musical, or action film. The psychology of the characters are masterfully developed leaving you with a sense of uneasiness. This movie needs to be seen  accompanied so you can definitely explore its nuances with someone else. The artists that portraited themselves as the psychologists were hilarious!!",1480896000,,432,4.917808219178082

7944318,2,B00005LQ0C,"Overall I must say this was a wierd movie.  Now I saw the description on the guide and it said it was twisted.  So, ok I like twisted.  Well the twisted part was ok, but the film making was awful.  I think this would make for a real good movie in the right hands.",1266883200,,263,3.814814814814815
7944319,5,B00005LQ0C,"This psychological thriller did very well on the film festival circuit, but surprisingly, has not led to much for director/star, Kevin DiNovis, who took a big chance playing the lead character at the last minute when his original lead got cold feet.

  Anti-social dishwasher Trevor (Peter Pryor) watches attractive women eating in the restaurant where he works.  Afraid to talk to them, he has a habit of stealing their used silverware, taking it home, and masturbating while orally exploring his stolen prizes. Lahn (DiNovis) is a heroin addict, on the run from his former roommate, a drug dealer who he has robbed. Sensing Lahn's desperate need for a fix and a place to stay, Trevor agrees to supply Lahn's shelter and daily dose, but at a price.  It starts off simple enough: Lahn must do household chores to earn his keep.  As Trevor realizes just how much power someone can have over a drug addict simply by supplying the drugs, he begins to take advantage of the situation.  Trevor turns Lahn into his slave, having him do housework while wearing an apron with the name Dorothy stitched on it.  Gradually, as more and more boundaries are pushed, Lahn must dress and act like ""Dorothy"", the ideal girlfriend of Trevor's creation.  From there it becomes a tale of confused sexual servitude; full of mind games and power struggles, until a final intense point of no return.

  Unlike most of the films on this list, SURRENDER DOROTHY is more of a realist drama than an exaggerated comedy, science fiction, musical, or action film.  Like the work of Todd Solondz, it's dark, disturbing and will leave you thinking about it for awhile.  While loaded with sexual overtones, the film is not likely to be much of a turn on to most (unless you like seeing DiNovis in a dress).  Sexual content comes from scenes of freaky [...]and confused homosexuality (a straight man in a dress being seduced/raped by another straight man: ""But I'm not gay.""  ""Neither am I."").  DiNovis' portrayal of a somewhat pretty-boy drug addict might seem a little exaggerated if not unbelievable to anyone who has known any heroin users that far into their addiction.  Besides making plenty of statements about mental health and drug addiction, SURRENDER DOROTHY is one of the best under-appreciated psychological dramas of the past decade.",1149120000,2,2314,4.904884318766067
7944320,4,B00005LQ0C,"Surrender Dorothy is a study of the world of sexual depravity and abuse, NOT homosexuality.  Anyone calling this a ""gay"" movie is, in essence, alleging that homosexual males are depraved.",1112227200,4,187,5.233333333333333
