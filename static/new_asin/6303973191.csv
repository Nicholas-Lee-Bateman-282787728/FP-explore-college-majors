7857417,4,6303973191,"The Speeches Of .... series has a chronic problem with sound biting of important speeches (so that all you hear is a catch phrase -- no chance to  appreciate rhetoric or context), showing inappropriate footage instead of  the speaker, and brief truncated unattributed excerpts (in the worst cases,  constructing speeches that were never given out of bits and pieces of other  speeches).  This one is mercifully free of those problems; there are  satisfactorily large chunks, mostly 10-15 minute clips, of several of the  key speeches of Reagan's career, including the Goldwater support speech  (1964), the First Inaugural, the ""evil empire"", Star Wars (almost  in its entirety), and the Farewell (about 70% of it).  Suitable for  actually hearing and seeing what he said, with few interruptions and very  little annoying cuts to stock footage.  (A minor complaint is the tendency  of music to come swelling up before the speech is over).  Kudos to the  director who knew what to do with good footage.  A second volume, with the  Normandy speech, the ""After Challenger"" speech, ""I paid for  this microphone"", the '76 concession, and of course ""Mr.  Gorbachev tear down this wall"" -- and perhaps a couple of the gaffes  like the Bitburg one -- would round out the collection nicely.  Not great  -- there are still some needless and awkward cuts -- but much better than  the common run of this series.  -- J.
