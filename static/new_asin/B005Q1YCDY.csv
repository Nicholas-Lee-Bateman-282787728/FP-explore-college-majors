8482853,5,B005Q1YCDY,"Sometimes old movies are the best. Remembering that it was made during World War 2, it is a good old fashioned action yarn.",1417219200,,123,4.391304347826087
8482854,4,B005Q1YCDY,Would have given 5 but quality of film could have been better,1414972800,,61,4.166666666666667
8482855,5,B005Q1YCDY,"This little know film is a fine memorial to the Royal Canadian Navy and the role the Service played in the winning of The Battle of the Atlantic.

At first thought, Randolph Scott seemed a bit unusual for the lead character.  Yet his manner of speech and actions are spot on for his role.  His gives a fine performance and is well supported by a host of character actors from the 1930s and `40s we`ve all seen and know, and who come through again in giving this film an aura of authenticity.

At the start of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy was definitely a poor relation of the mother country.  At the end of the war however, Canada has one of the biggest navies of the Allied forces and had ships throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  This expansion and assigned role of escorting convoys across the Atlantic was vital to the eventual winning of the war.  This film shows this task being tackled, from training of Sailors to the construction of ships to tackle the German submarines along with the North Atlantic.

I highly recommend this film to all those with an interest in the Battle of the Atlantic and the navies invovled.",1401494400,2,1143,4.514563106796117
8482856,5,B005Q1YCDY,OK so this is a WWII allies propaganda film. I still like it. It has the rather shallow romance common to these films. The corvettes were basically a commercial fishing design adapted for convoy escort duty. They must have been extremely uncomfortable to serve on. Their success was really rather high though and they plugged a gap that badly needed plugging in convoy escorts.,1395273600,,377,4.90625
8482857,5,B005Q1YCDY,This movie is about the Canadian navy in WW2.  It has a bunch of stars that are very young and are not even listed in the credits.,1379289600,2,130,3.814814814814815
8482858,4,B005Q1YCDY,"it's everything I expected,it took a little longer to show up than I thought. I think the quality of CD is a weak",1371254400,,113,3.9565217391304346

8482861,2,B005Q1YCDY,"Looks like it was taped from tv, horible picture quality,
this in no way is a new dvd. The only bright spot is
it's comercial free.",1335139200,12,131,4.076923076923077
