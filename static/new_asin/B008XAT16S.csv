8531787,4,B008XAT16S,"I'm only speaking for ""Good Mother"" because that is the reason I made this purchase.  It is an excellent sleeper film that deserved more acclaim than it got.  It is still very relevant to today in that it showcases a pair of middle age people who come together to find love but in the process something very irresponsible happens.  Their lives and their relationship spirals out of control as a result.  It's sad as things progress but at the end she is fortunate to still have the close connection that she does with her daughter.  Much is lost . . . but ALL is not lost.  We truly are responsible for the consequences that flow from our bad choices.",1407283200,2,651,4.428571428571429
8531788,4,B008XAT16S,"Love, ""The Good Mother"" and have since the late 80's when I first saw it.  I own it on VHS, but the price of ""The Good Mother"" alone is outrageous; packaged with ""Angie"" it's a steal!  Showcasing the acting ability of Liam Neeson before Schindler's List made him a star and after ""Suspect"" with Cher, showed what a good actor he was.  You could see the star quality then.  In addition, this is probably the only movie I ever saw Diane Keaton act in.  She was surprisingly good in this dramatic role.  Hollywood usually cast her as ditsy, and I have tried to read one of her books, and she is ditsy, so I don't suspect she usually has to do much acting.  This movie showed me she could accompanied by the likes of someone like Neeson.

""Angie"" was also pretty good.  Geena Davis can make a silk purse out of a sows ear.

I would recommend this packaged bargain.",1398556800,,860,4.31875
