7882661,5,6305078998,"""Serenity"" instantly transforms your environment into a safe soothing place for your soul to relax. This DVD could be used to help you sleep or to reduce anxiety and calm you at the end of a stressful day. You can experience a variety of moods and seasonal portraits set to music.

Summer is filled with plants growing, flowers blooming and surf crashing against rocks with beautiful sunsets. Nature becomes animated as you can literally watch grass grow and nature renewing itself after a long winter. In the ocean scenes there is a soft sway of an underwater garden.

Winter has an especially beautiful purity and the clarity of the music is enhanced by softly falling snow and snow-laden branches. Christmas music plays for a few minutes on this DVD and brings a sense of peace and soothing memories.

 Sweetly serene moments almost reach a poetic perfection as waterfalls cascade from great heights as sounds from nature enhance the soothing music. I especially enjoyed the sections set to classical guitar. ""Serenity"" works as well as being out in nature or by the ocean watching the waves.

If you love this Moodtape you may also want to look for Autumn Whispers, Tranquility, Ocean Reflections, Whispering Water, Pacific Surf, Romantic Classics or Contemporary Christmas.
