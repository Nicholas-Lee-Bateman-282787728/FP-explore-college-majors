7820662,5,6302041171,"In this decade, every episode of ""I Love Lucy"" will be celebrating its 50th Anniversary.  Every episode is still funny as funny as when they first aired.  The shows are good. The shows are wholesome.  They are healing and warm and will make you feel good.  But them on VHS or DVD today.",1041724800,,286,4.339622641509434
7820663,5,6302041171,"""Lucy Tells the Truth""- I loved this episode. Lucy bets that she can tell the truth for 24-hour straight- sound easy? Not for Lucy. In this episode, watch her divulge her true haircolor, age, and weight- as well as  what she REALLY thinks of Ethel, Ricky, Fred- and her other friends. Lucy,  like always, gets into a mess and has to scheme her way out.
""The  Kleptomaniac""- This is my favorite 'I Love Lucy' episode. Lucy has  disobeyed Ricky once again- promising to help with the bazaar after Ricky  has forbidden her to do so. When Ricky starts to notice something strange  (money and other people's furniture hidden in the apartment), he thinks  that Lucy has become a kleptomaniac. When he confronts her, Lucy realizes  she must either act like a kleptomanic or admit that she has disobeyed. The  rest of the epsode- Lucy (and Ethel) as crooks, is hilarious.",945820800,13,863,4.7
7820664,5,6302041171,"Among Lucy afficionados, this is a favourite episode; it works because it is a subject most anyone can relate: the habit of fibbing. After claiming she starred in a stage version of ""Oklahoma"" (Ricky: ""You know you were never in ""Oklahoma"" Lucy: ""I was too. I spent two weeks in Tulsa once!"") Ricky and the Mertzes bet Lucy $100 she can't tell the truth for 24 hours. Not only does she tell the truth, but she tells everyone EXACTLY what she thinks of them! The bridge game at Carolyn Appleby's is classic: (Lucy:""And let ME keep score this time, Carolyn - YOU CHEAT! - YES,..CHEAT! - I would have said something if I hadn't been your bridge partner!!"") Eventually Lucy gets knives ""thrown"" at her when she claims she speaks Italian. Notice in the scene where Ricky Ethel and Fred are discussing her audition - there's an echo chamber effect due to a faulty recording problem via the mikes (this is an extreme rarity in this painstakingly made series). ""The Kleptomaniac"" is also a very funny episode. Joseph Kearns of ""Dennis the Menace"" fame is the doctor Ricky brings home because he believes Lucy to be a thief. The second half comes off better than the first with Lucy and Ethel playing crooks -they're terrific- and when Lucy pretends to be hypnotized, she's great as usual.",944265600,2,1280,4.668141592920354
