8324331,2,B000GL195I,Although I really enjoyed seeing the old video of Akamine Sensei performing kata and truly documents the history of his organization I thought the production in particular the interview was not that great.  Mr. Lee truly had a vision when he filmed this in the 60's but I wish he had of said which kobudo kata Akamine taught him instead of which weapons he was taught.,1195948800,,368,4.575757575757576
