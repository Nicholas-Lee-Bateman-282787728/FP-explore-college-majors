4715949,4,B005K8RJ10,"I am from Joy Road and Wyoming -- west side. I know where most of the locations were in the film and what canvas the director tried to emulate on-screen. Let me be honest here, it wasn't the best movie nor the worst. I have been looking into this project for months now, some people have probably been waiting for years. This project, from what I have read, initially began in 2004. So that's a 7-8 year difference just to release the film. Was it worth the wait?

Tony Smalls (Wood Harris) is a defense attorney, born and raised in Detroit. Now highly successful, he is trying to move his way to the top with his dutiful wife. They both live the suburban life with their suburban colleagues -- but when Tony is called in a favor from his sweet-natured sister, he has no choice but to return home to the streets where he was raised. His sister, Nia (N'Bushe Wright), requests Tony's help in order to save her boyfriend Big Boy (Trick Trick) from going to jail on a multiple murder charge. When Tony accepts, he suspects that Big Boy is guilty -- that is until he realizes that he may, in fact, be innocent. Over the course of the film, not only is Tony investigating the murders, but he is also looking into Big Boy's background -- learning more about who is in control and what consequences he may face if he keeps looking in the right direction.

There are some really powerful scenes in the film that captures Detroit perfectly. Everyone who watched it with me agreed that the principal cast is really good, especially Wood Harris (whom I love as an actor). Harris brings more to the table than his former ""The Wire"" co-star, Jamie Hector, who plays a malicious rival of Big Boy in the film. In retrospect, I believe that Hector may have been miscast. He did not strike me as being from Detroit, let alone a street-type. Harris, who is from Chicago -- has that Midwest feel I was looking for. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing bad about playing what you aren't, but for this film, it should've been someone more authentic or someone who is capable of taking on regional behaviors, speech and mannerisms. The smaller roles, which featured bona fide Detroit actors, ironically, were weak. Some moments I felt like I wanted to look out of my window to see the real thing. Aside from the actors, it was something else missing from ""Joy Road"". Was it the media? More locations? The barbershops? Gas stations? Something vital wasn't there, and I can't put my finger on it.

Overall, the film was decent. The music was great, some of the camera work was good. I would have really liked to see this in theaters. The only problem with the film is that it leaves you misinformed. This is how Detroit is, to a degree, but not everything is like this in the D. It may seem like the film is well-researched, but honestly, do you really think a lawyer would go around asking questions about a murder without letting his superiors know? Come on now! Be realistic. Tony Smalls shows the audience that leaving is staying and becoming successful is the new bourgeois (bougie). You can never get out.

I hunted this film down in a Redbox for days, but I finally snagged it. So if you can, please RENT the movie first before you buy it because not everyone will be enlightened by it like I was. I look forward to getting this and sharing this with more of my fellow Detroiters who haven't seen it (or even heard about it).

4715950,4,B005K8RJ10,"The film takes place in Detroit on the ironically named ""Joy Road."" At age 9 Tony Smalls (Wood Harris) is sent to a private school and becomes an attorney, although not overly successful. His sister Nia (N'Bushe Wright) dates a thug named Big Boy excellently portrayed by Christian Mathis. When Big Boy is accused of a baby killing, Nia begs Tony to defend him.

Tony is torn between defending a thug and his wife's white bread world. Pressure is placed on Tony to take a plea bargain and of course Big Boy claims he is innocent. The trial becomes a show case for politics and money as a private prison organization is using this case to lobby for a 3 strikes law (I believe they actually did this in Arizona according to R. Maddow).

There were several awkwardly written scenes which brought out some awkward moments for Wood Harris, who just didn't seem right for the role. Outside of the main character, the acting was acceptable, and at times gritty street good.

4715973,5,B005K8RJ10,A very realistic and grimey story of an ex lawyer who accepts the job of representing an infamous killer and finds his life in jeapordy.

4715974,3,B005K8RJ10,"It's as if the producers ran out of money and had to cut the project short.  The movie had promise, but the story concluded far too early and left you confused and disappointed.

4715980,3,B005K8RJ10,"Joy Road introduces Tony Smalls and chronicles his life's journey as a child that didn't fit in because of his parents' determination that he not become a statistic.  Tony attended private schools while his siblings went to public.  Tony became an attorney and married an ambitious woman and their life basically steered away from his home ground.  Baby sis, Nia's boyfriend is a known drug kingpin and gets pinned for a capital murder case of which he and Nia proclaim his innocence.  What's a brother to do...charge it to the game or stand up for family?  Surburbia or the hood?  Life or death?  Politically correct or hood conscious?

Joy Road was a good movie, slow paced, depicting a life of ambition, loyalty, division, betrayals, murder, and scandal.  Wood Harris did a good job and I thought it was ironic to see Avon vs Marlo in this movie. 3.68",1334707200,,854,4.716216216216216
