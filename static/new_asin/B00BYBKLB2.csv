5682349,2,B00BYBKLB2,"Sophie Lellouche's Paris Manhattan feels like a rip off of her hero Woodt Allen films. The problems are many: the story feels contrived and trite, the characters look too good, there are multiple subplots that cause the film to languish, and above all there is a strange deja vu feeling that we've seen all of this before in a much better fashion in Herbert Ross's Play It Again Sam. On the positive side there is a decent cameo by Woddy Allen himself.

Alice Ovitz (alice Taglioni) is a thirty something pharmacist living in Paris who appears to have everything but a husband which her family desperately feels she needs. Alice does have one man in her life, even if it is only the poster of Woody Allen hanging on her bedroom wall. The poster becomes important  because she turns to it for life advice. Sort of like the Bogart picture in a more polished Play It Again,Sam. Allen offers quotes from his movies in a voiceover which Alice takes to be life advice.

In the course of her quest for a mate she must deal with her neurotic Jewish family including a sister Helene (Marine Delterme) who stole and married Alice's one true love at the beginning of the film. The men that Alice encounters include Vincent (Yannick Soulier) who appears to spark some interest but disappears from the scene about two thirds into the film an Victor (Patrick Briel) an alarm salesman who eventually wins Alice's heart.

Most of the problem with the set up is that all of this has been done many times before in the standard rom-com format. I kept wanting to say ""Move on, there is nothing to see here."" We know how this film will turn out long before its short 77 minute run time is up. The only surprising thing is the above mentioned cameo from Woody Allen himself which brings the relationship quest to its conclusion.

This is a rather difficult fil to find more than likely due to its poor showing at the box office. The Blu Ray that I viewed was region 2 and maintained its French sountrack throughout. The film itself is subtitled in English but the special features consisting of a making of featurette and some cast interviews are not. The picture and sound quality are excellent I just wish that this film had lived up to its potential.

This is for Woody Allen completists only. If you must have it seek out the lowest priced version you can find because the overall film will have a tendency to leave a sickly sweet taste in your mouth.",1379635200,2,2434,4.533029612756264

I have not liked Woody Allen movies in the past, but the infatuation of the main character in this movie with Woody Allen gave me a new appreciation of him.  I have not seen a romantic comedy that I have enjoyed quite as much as this one in quite a while.

5682363,5,B00BYBKLB2,"I don't ever remember this 2011 film ever playing in the US (certainly not in Philadelphia). I'm a big fan of Woody Allen's early firms and one of those is, of course, ""Play It again Sam"", where Woody's character is guided through his life by none other than Humphrey Bogart (who is played by an actor impersonating Bogie""). I also like ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" about a woman seeking a husband and dealing with her family.

Well, in this homage to Allen, the main character is a woman who keeps a life-size photo of Woody on her wall (she loves his DVDs and rents or loans them to people in the pharmacy where she works). And Woody's photo does talk to her (literally) with some great lines. I won't tell you much more as it is fun to discover classic Allen moments and the film (in French - with easy to read subtitles - and English - no subtitles appear when actors speaking English) is just 77 minutes long.

I scanned the other reviews here and I don't remember seeing any mention of the GREAT bonus short on the DVD version. It's a small short film titled ""Woody Before Allen"", made by a young Russian Filmmaker.  Serious Allen fans know that his original name was Allen Koenigsberg and there is a city in Russia that was originally a German city named Koenigsberg. The town wants to build a monument to Woody and this film (which does feature Woody in his own home!) tells that story. Honestly, it's worth getting the DVD just to watch this.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful!

5682366,1,B00BYBKLB2,"My wife and I love French films and romantic comedies, and I love Woody Allen, so this movie seemed perfect for us. However, we hated this film from early on. All of the characters act without any logic and do inexplicable things. There is no chemistry between the ""romantic"" leads. The main character is a beautiful woman whose problem is that men don't ask her out. In frigging Paris. Even at a short 78 minutes, this film is not worth your time.",1413072000,2,448,4.475609756097561

5682368,3,B00BYBKLB2,"Am I the only one with a DVD where the subtitles disappeared for several minutes about 4/5ths of the way in, then resumed?

Aside from that issue, I was looking forward to seeing this for a long time, but it really failed to pull me in for some reason.  The cast is attractive, and I'll look forward to Alice Taglioni in other things, but it just wasn't particularly funny or involving or interesting or charming on any level.",1412640000,,426,4.448717948717949
