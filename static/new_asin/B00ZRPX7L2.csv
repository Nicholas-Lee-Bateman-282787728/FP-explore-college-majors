8720778,5,B00ZRPX7L2,Great coverage. Fun to watch,1455926400,,28,4.8
8720779,3,B00ZRPX7L2,A bit too much interviewing of racers and human interest stories and not enough race coverage.  Also more details of the crashes should have been given and the outcome of the injuries.  The amount of actual racing shown is what you see on YouTube.,1452816000,,247,4.590909090909091
8720780,3,B00ZRPX7L2,"Some excellent camera shots but transitions are poor and jumpy.
Nothing on Dunlops 'get off' and who else was involed.
Nice try at the start with the reporter appearing to be in events gone by but, I would leave those effects to true professionals. (Sorry)
Overall, worth watching especially if you are a TT fan but DUKE needs to get better at production if they continue charging these prices.",1451779200,,394,4.72463768115942

8720782,5,B00ZRPX7L2,"Yeah,Mike. Now it's wrong to smoke and drink in Central Park. Separate charges. Nothing personal this time though. They're trying to negotiate for peace with the Revolutionary Army of Colombia. I'm not going to need a degree to figure this out. Also there's that town in Brazil that got washed away by a dam that broke up(too soon?).You know how it is though. If I could get a week or so off to see you guys in June. There would be Dominos,a few buckets of Imperial Stout(no ice,of course),and a single malt TBA.I don't think I would be the only person to appreciate Dunhill in Douglas. I don't know any other reason to leave the island until you folks are through. To everybody else:Even if you could do what I would want to do,get this video on an annual basis. These guys know how to ride. This is the most dangerous course. They got all the bases covered along the course. You won't miss much. Then there's the aftermath from those up front and those not far behind.",1443052800,,970,4.455056179775281
8720783,5,B00ZRPX7L2,Fantastic! The TT can never let you down when it comes to action.,1441584000,,65,4.076923076923077
8720784,5,B00ZRPX7L2,"2015 was a terrific year at the Isle of Man TT. Each race saw several serious contenders battling for the honours, and some of the races were nail-biting to the finish with only a few seconds separating the leaders after more than 200 miles on the road. Hot prospects for the solo races included Michael Dunlop, Bruce Anstey, John McGuinness, James Hillier, Michael Rutter, Guy Martin, Lee Johnstone and Ian Hutchinson  the last of these, Hutchy, returning to the TT after five years of brave struggle to recover from devastating injury.

With expert commentary from Steve Parrish and James Whitham, this DVD bring us four hours of coverage of the nine races, including interviews with the leading contenders and reactions from winners and podium spots. Above all, though, it's the visual coverage that makes it special. There are many superb sequences showing men on bikes hurtling through the island's beautiful landscape, between houses and hedges, through towns and villages, over bridges and bumps, up and then down the road over the mountain. Footage includes shots from roadside, helicopter and on-bike cameras  these latter giving a real feeling of what it's like to ride a motorbike at hair-raising speeds.

Since many bike enthusiasts will already know the results, there seems no harm in mentioning a few of them here. But if you don't want to know until youve watched the DVD, better stop reading the rest of this paragraph. Highlights include the widely acclaimed comeback of Hutchy with some stunning firsts, and the understandable emotion after his first win for five years as well as his generous tribute to the medical staff who made it possible. Then there are the fine performances of James Hillier; Ivan Lintin in the Lightweight class 'on bikes you could ride down to the shops'; the Birchall brothers in the sidecars; and popular New Zealand beardie Bruce Anstey, in spite of that severe aerodynamic handicap. Above all, though, we can watch John McGuinness' thrilling demolition of the opposition in the final race, the Senior; of course the Morecambe missile had never really been away for long, but it feels like a comeback after a week in the relative shade of some of those other guys (apart from his win in the TT Zero electric class, to please the many environmentalists among us bike fans). Still king of the mountain, a new outright lap record and, on top of all that, an all-round decent guy  as we see from the calm, modest, understated manner of his post-race interviews.

I could have done with more technical information about the bikes and their differences, and a bit of reaction from at least a few spectators, but I suppose you can't have everything. A DVD overview such as this offers far more of the racing action than you'll ever see as a spectator, inevitably stuck in your chosen spot for the duration of each race. It also gives a real feeling for the TT atmosphere, whether you've ever been to the Island or not. If you havent, then this is about as close as you can get.",1439078400,3,3018,4.827852998065764
