8052183,2,B0007UZMOW,"This is not what I wanted at all! I am a Spanish teacher, and wanted an informational but interesting and current DVD on Semana Santa in Spain. For $39.99 this is a rip off! It's clearly old footage, (though the date says 2004, it's clearly from the 90s)and doesn't even cover the processions in Sevilla- where they are the most popular! There are no options to have subtitles or anything to adjust the difficulty level for the level of students who are watching. I was bored stiff, I don't know how my students could focus and have any interest in this amazing celebration. What a disappointment!",1239148800,5,597,4.6415094339622645
