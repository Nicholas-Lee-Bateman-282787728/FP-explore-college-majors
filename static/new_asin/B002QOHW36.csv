3967566,4,B002QOHW36,"This movie is done really well, with a good plot and acting.  The plot gets a bit obscure at times in favor of presenting the message - though that's really not noticeable (at least if you don't watch the commentaries, and there are two).  Most likely your getting this movie because of the message anyway, so that would actually be a good thing.",1264291200,4,346,4.476190476190476
3967567,5,B002QOHW36,I just watched Sarah's Choice on 1/11/10. It is well made and has quality actors. The storyline is based on a single career woman named Sarah who becomes pregnant unexpectant. She faces a decision of what to do with the child and the direction of her life. I have TV Guardian and it even did not have anything to cut out. This would be a good family film and is pro-life. God reveals Himself to her in a series of three dreams before she makes her decision about the child and her future.

The biggest highlight of this film is the acting.  There are amazing performances in this movie.  From Brad Stine, to Andrea Logan White, to Stacy Keanan  - to everyone else in between - the supporting cast does a great job.  Yet the person who deserves the most accolades in this work is the leading lady Rebecca St. James.  It is Rebecca that makes the movie excel.  She delivers an onscreen presence, an emotional depth, and an acting ability that quite frankly I didn't know that she possessed!

3967574,1,B002QOHW36,"Poor acting, poor casting, poor writing.

I followed Rebecca St. James music career and I was curious about this movie because of her. Yes, she's pretty and big on  the christian scene, but she was poorly cast. First, they never really explained why she's the only one in her family to have an Australian accent. She should have tried to smooth out her accent (which is the actor's job, no?) or the writers should have written in an explanation. Also, why didn't the ""future"" Sarah not have the accent? Second, she's clearly in her 30's and her boyfriend is in his 20's. Nothing wrong about that, but I felt that the movie was trying to convince the audience that Rebecca's character was in her 20's.

The story telling was mediocre. Obviously the writers did little to no research on abortion, other options or how a nonreligious person would have reacted in that situation. The religious bias made for a poorly executed story. So many plot holes, flat dialog, and it barely scratched the surface of a very deep topic.

Not worth the time or money.",1433116800,,1049,4.654054054054054

3967579,4,B002QOHW36,"This would not be my first choice as entertainment but it was a good movie none the less. It deals with a topic that many people have strong feelings for one way or the other, and sadly far too many in similar and different situations have to make this decision. This movie does a decent job of showing how hard it is to make the decision and what you may have to deal with which ever way you choose. In the movie Sarah is guided by dreams of her future child and a strict parent so you know what her choice will be, but it also shows her friends choice, and how the situations affect the other people involved. Thankfully the movie does not deal with attacks on clinics and physicians or the tactics used by those with strong feelings on the subject (both sides).",1417824000,,764,4.275862068965517

3967583,1,B002QOHW36,"While I never bought this film, I did watch it while channel surfing. The issue presented isn't really all that black and white. I will preface this with saying I'm a pro-choice person, as opposed to many of the rave reviews this film has received. Sarah is working her way up the career ladder when her boyfriend knocks her up. While sort of uncertain on keeping the baby at first, the bad acting really doesn't convey the point effectively, the only thing the protagonist considers is either abortion or loose her career (even though giving it up for adoption is an equally viable option). Aside from the wacko workplace that pretty much tells her to abort the kid (seriously, how is this realistic in any way?), there's the apparent implications that, if Sarah gets just ONE abortion, she'll end up old and alone. As if this child will be the only child Sarah ever conceives ever. Even though Sarah had a friend who admitted to getting an abortion in the past because she wasn't in a position to take adequate care of it. Which pretty much a position Sarah is in. Which is treated as a bad thing. I guess I just don't have the mindset to enjoy this film. If this is the best of pro-life films (if the other reviews are to be believed) I would hate to see the worst. They must be even more mind boggling.",1399852800,,1306,4.445833333333334

3967591,2,B002QOHW36,"I'll preface my review of this movie by stating that I am a 100% Christian/pro-life advocate. My criticism of this movie has only to do with the quality of the overall production.

That said, it kind of hurts to write this review because I think it's great that there are people who want to take on this subject. In fact, I think it's swept under the rug far too often by my fellow Christians.

But here's the truth:

The acting in this movie is largely sub-par and stale. There were a couple of decent supporting actors who I think did a pretty good job despite the weak material they had to work with.
But there were moments where I thought the writing was so cliche and sappy that I cringed. Also, I know Rebecca St. James is Australian, but I could swear that I heard a few of the other actors going back and forth between American and Australian accents. In fact, St. James herself, seemed to occasionally lose her accent and then find it again. Not really sure what was going on there, but it was a little confusing.

St. James was probably the worst actor in the movie, followed by the immediate supporting characters. It almost seemed like the smaller the role, the better the actor. This is the reverse of what I felt about ""Fireproof"". In that film I think the two lead actors were the only good ones.

Also, from a technical point of view it was just very flat and undramatic. It was shot and edited like a daytime soap opera. The whole thing is just way too drawn out and preachy and predictable.
It also suffers from the same problem that plagues most Christian niche marketed films, which is that the whole thing feels very sterilized and therefore unrealistic and hard to buy.
And of course, the fact that Sarah has all of these visions that push her to make the right choice is sweet and wholesome, but it's also cliche and predictable and boring.
Overall, I can't say this movie was ""terrible"", but it was not very good.

If you want to see a movie that deals with abortion in a more realistic way, that isn't preachy, that has some really good acting, good writing and is actually technically good on every level, then you should see ""Bella"".

I'd like to see more well-produced Christian-themed films. There are a few good ones (like ""Bella"" or ""The Passion of the Christ"" or the Narnia series films, for example).
I'm afraid this one just doesn't qualify.",1368230400,2,2375,4.496519721577727

3967596,5,B002QOHW36,"Abortion is one of those issues that most Christian filmmakers prefer to avoid like poison ivy. This movie took that subject on without flinching. Having never been in a position of either the prospective mother or father, I can only opine that the presentation of this seemed realistic. A lot of reviews have knocked the acting in this movie but I challenge those who slam the acting in this one to provide criteria instead of just a general statement concerning the lameness of the acting. I recently took lessons from a pro. He stressed continually that good acting is not acting at all but being natural. I thought Rebecca St. James was remarkable in her performance. Her timing and pregnant pauses and contemplative truth searching demonstrated through camera shots down into her soul via her eyes. I salute the producer's of this flick for taking on a very controversial subject and handling it with grace. If you're pro-life or pro-choice, you can enjoy this.

What may seem like a cheeky plot (and there are very brief moments, at times) is surprisingly executed with honesty, understanding, uncertainty, and (as it's title notes) choices. Rebecca St. James makes the amazing leap from singer to actress very subtly, yet carries the same amount of honesty, love and understanding as she does to her music. (You may be surprised by her performance at times, as well.) Overall, this is a well-made film with mostly solid performances, a fine-tuned script, and universal emotion to spare. A solid family pick.

3967602,4,B002QOHW36,"Even though I'm a Christian, I don't tend to go for Christian films all that much, because the production values are often poor, and the acting and writing lackluster. Most of them are centered around End Times, football, or a ""Little House On the Prairie""-type scenario, and that gets old fast. ""Sarah's Choice"" is a step in the right direction. It's not preachy or looking like it's trying too hard, and the writing and acting are decent. However, I had two major beefs with it.

First of all, Sarah should have peeked over the abyss a bit more--she could have met the mysterious stranger at the abortion clinic instead of the doctor's office. Calling a clinic on the phone didn't have as much punch. Her eventual choice would have been a lot less of a given if she had flirted with disaster.

Secondly, I thought Rebecca St. James was good, and I've been a fan of hers for years, but there's one part where you hear tears in her voice and feel her emotion, but don't see them on her face. It's a weepy scene, so there should be a few waterworks. Don't actors use fake tears sometimes? There's no shame in that--Debbie Reynolds rubbed onions on her eyes when she had to cry in ""Singin' In the Rain.""

""Sarah's Choice"" is a good film. I've seen it twice and each time it grips me, but I just think it could have used a bit more tension.",1322611200,4,1337,4.4048582995951415

Also, Sarah was rather unbelievably dense.  Really?  She needed all three visions to make her choice?  And the Magical Christmas card didn't clue her in?

That said though, I did enjoy the film, partly because self-involved characters redeemed themselves -- Sarah, her boyfriend, and her best friend.  There were no saints in this film.  No perfect characters.  But in the end, they all grew up and figured out what was most important in life. I also enjoyed the secondary characters, especially Uncle Clay.

She is surrounded by many pro-life people, and there are stories of folks--men included--who have terminated a pregnancy and now express anguish over it.

The only thing that was very difficult for me to get past is knowing that RSJ is a very devout ""wait for me"" type of person, espousing all the virtues of saving yourself for marriage.

That doesn't mean it has to replicate Hollywood values, but there is a real calling here for good Christian writers and actors to provide high quality entertainment.

3967616,5,B002QOHW36,"Sarah's Choice is an unapologetically yet grace-filled pro-life movie. It stars Christian recording artist Rebecca St. James as Sarah, a young woman climbing the ladder of success only to be forced to make a major decision that will affect her future. Sarah is up against relentless voices telling her to think only of herself. This movie does not shy away from presenting a realistic portrait of a young woman's dilemma.  Sarah's Choice is just as much a story about a woman's decision about abortion as it is about a young man coming to terms with his role and responsibility when faced with his girlfriend's pregnancy. It is poignantly relevant to a young generation bent on a quest for self-fulfillment.

Directed by Chad Kapper, this film bears the hallmarks of Christian films rooted in a biblical message, yet it also takes a step forward for Christian filmmaking. Sarah's Choice keeps a steady balance of drama and comedic moments without undercutting the seriousness of the film. The camera close-ups of Sarah's emotional reactions in confronting her boyfriend and family about her pregnancy pull the viewer into the highly personal nature of the film.

Sarah's Choice is a beacon of light that courageously illuminates the biblical response to one of the most highly debated moral issues of our day. The culture of death is slowly invading the impressionable young minds of our generation. Sarah's Choice is a must-see film which can serve to rekindle the flame of commitment to preserve the sanctity of life. But as much as this film champions the right to life of the unborn, it also extends a hand of hope for healing and grace to those who have undergone an abortion.

Besides the obvious appeal to choose life over death, there is an underlying message in Sarah's Choice. We are urged to trust God with our own life. When we are open to listening to God's voice, He speaks life to us. And as carriers of God's Truth, we speak life to others.",1267747200,12,1956,4.829850746268657

If we had been watching this with a crowd, that might not have been an option, as some people find subtitles too distracting.

All in all, Rebecca St. James did a fine job in this film.  I did expect the visions or dreams to be a tad longer and more detailed, but once I accepted that, it was fine.

3967619,5,B002QOHW36,"The message in this movie is one that should get out to everyone.  Any Christian School would be interested in showing this to their class.  I enjoyed this film because as a parent it reinforced how we as parents can help our children by example. It also made me want to foster a closer relationship with them so that in a time of need, they could count on me for advice and not go elsewhere for it.  The film left you with a feeling that if you have made a bad choice in your life, there is hope and love and your faith to help you through it.",1264464000,19,544,4.018518518518518
8377840,4,B002QOHW36,"I signed up for PureFlix looking for a specific movie that I caught part of on TV and I still have not found it. I thought this was the one. I watched this film all the way through and actually like it. I cried in parts and I thought that I was beyond sobbing at movies. Sarah, the main protagonist, is shown several visions of her future life with her daughter. With each of her visions I remembered what a joy it's been to raise my family and see their own babies. It has not always been easy, but I wouldn't have it any other way. As to the film, this is not a heavy-handed fire-and-brimstone feature. What this motion picture is, is a glimpse into how the decisions we make with our God-given freedom of choice affect others, not just ourselves. I just hope that, with education, we can all make the right choice. A similar film from a man's perspective is ""Family Man"" starring Nicolas Cage. Marriage and family can mean compromise, or delaying our wants, but let an old woman tell you, family relations are like climbing a mountain -- it can be a struggle and there are places of rest and beauty along the way, but once you've reached the summit, you know it's worth it.",1519430400,,1176,4.35

8377846,5,B002QOHW36,Outstanding Christian movie which covers the pro's and con's of abortion and how it may or may not effect ones future life.  Only found one short scene near the end which I felt was sort of lame and did not fit well in the overall movie.  It was of Sarah's face and her praying.  That is just my view.  Every other scene throughout the movie I thought was placed together in making a great story.,1494288000,,396,4.24
