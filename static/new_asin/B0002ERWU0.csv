2081458,5,B0002ERWU0,"I always rely on the Amazon reviewers remarks before purchasing anything for my 2 year old granddaughter. (Thank you all out there) I was not disappointed this time. Very cute puppets with very real (and happy) children and great music which parents will enjoy. The video was for ages 9-24 months which I didn't realize before I bought it, but it didn't matter. We dance and sing to the music and participate in the interactive aspects (""stop!"" ""Go!"") I intend to buy more for my new grandson on his way!",1238889600,,504,4.611111111111111

My son loves to listen to the music and dance while my daughter now knows the words to all the songs and the movements that go along with them.  The entire series is a nice set that my two children can enjoy together. Curious buddies is a educational dvd that teaches without sounding like a drill instructor.  Vocabulary is repeated throughout the video, but not drilled. We now own the entire series!",1208304000,,467,4.470588235294118

2081464,5,B0002ERWU0,"My son never liked to watch tv till when he was about 18 months and i found these. he was immediately drawn to the puppets, the songs(which are addictive) and the scenery. these are great dvds for your little one. my son liked them much more than all of his baby einstein combined. id give these at least a try if you're skeptical before you go for something else. my neighbors daughter loved them too. they have a continuous play on them also.",1183766400,,444,4.36144578313253

2081468,5,B0002ERWU0,"These ""Curious Buddies"" by Nick Jr., are not only adorable, but the show is absolutely educational!  I cannot stress how much my son has learned from watching them.  They make him laugh and I know that he is learning at the same time he is having fun! And they are inexpensive compared to all the other baby/toddler dvd's out there.  Give them a try.

2081469,5,B0002ERWU0,"My daughter first clued me in to this extremely cute series of DVDs/VHS. She found out about them from a young male retailer at a very large electronics chain. The puppets are a bit silly but the toddlers LOVE them! The content of each of the series is good. From 12 months to 2 1/2 yrs seems to be the most popular obcessive ""watching"" time (I have two two year old Grandsons separated by 5 weeks) and they ask for and will watch ""buddies"" in loo of any other video. It has only been in the last year that my five year old Grandson stopped asking to watch them. Cute songs, instuctive and keeps their attention--incase you need to do something else--like shower! My daughter and daughter-in-law,each have a full set and I have two--one for each house. You won't regret this purchase!",1136678400,,784,4.489510489510489

The songs are really catchy (I've found myself singing them when the DVD isn't even on), and the scenes are fun to watch - especially the puppets themselves, they are adorable. She gets really excited when this video comes on, and we love it as much today as when we first got it. (and p.s., the other ""Curious Buddies"" videos are just as cute!)",1127865600,3,472,4.436781609195402

My son won't sit still for anything on TV, but he begs to put these on and then won't leave the room until it's over.
