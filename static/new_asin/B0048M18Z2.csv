8730805,1,B0048M18Z2,"This item was not a authentic DVD, then the DVD didn't work half way through it.  I purchased the DVD for a surprise for my bro since he was featured in the Tallahassee section of it.  But low and behold we couldn't even see it the DVD was dragging so bad you couldn't even watch it.  A waste of money.  I didn't expect to receive bootleg merchandise from amazon.",1333670400,,363,4.217391304347826
