So far, I am really enjoying this documentary series. You get the history without having to slog through a  tedious textbook!  I hope there will be more episodes coming!",1461888000,11,577,4.783505154639175
8644834,5,B00IRYXYLS,"Season One:
Six separate episodes of ""Raiders of the Lost Art"" contain so much information including the Diabolical works of the Nazi's as they took over the artwork of Europe including the Imperial Faberge Eggs of Peter Carl Faberge which tell the history of the Romanov Tsars. These unique and interesting six historical views explain so many happenings that I didn't know. Of the two Tsars familys, without the eggs themselves, we would be bereft of so much of their personal history. In the episode ""The Hunt for the Faberge Eggs"" we view and learn about all of the gorgeous ""Imperial Eggs"" and if you are interested in Russian history, it is very satisfying knowledge. I consider it one of my favorite episodes personally as far as viewing them all strikingly up close in all their colorful and beautiful detail along with the ability to now understand the last Tsars from the Romanov Dynasty before they were taken over by the Revolution. It had an interesting feel for me as the history was basically lost, but for the gifting of these Imperial Eggs to the Tsarinas by their husbands. It was the first time I could view the entire collection in awe, I must admit, except for the couple which cannot be accounted forYet.

The Lost Artwork Includes portraits by painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Johannes Vermeer, and Leonardo da Vinci along with how they have contributed to our library of beauty. All of their paintings/portraits could have been lost from our sight forever, if not for the loved ones who brought them back into the light, during separate episodes, these all prove to be extremely interesting. One of the most enlightening of all is the episode concerning ""The Monuments Men"" who bravely retrieved so many stolen and hidden works of art possible. If not for them, the greatest and precious artworks of all time would have been lost to us during ""The Rape of Europa"". This separate Documentary by the same name explains so much more than the Hollywood movie or the episode included within this documentary. I would recommend the documentary for a complete rendering of how the Nazi's took over while stealing great works for themselves without batting an eye or destroying and putting away works they deemed unfit of that greatness.

At least one major mistake was made by the Nazis giving way to our great advantage in another episode, featuring one very aged reclusive-son trying to keep them under wraps. The hidden art was somehow, at the very end, brought out for the world to view. This son held onto famous paintings for the Nazi's while being worked for their sale by his double-agent father who stole many for himself. The Nazi's believed these great works of art to be either ""degenerate"" (not worth being a piece of legitimate artwork) or held for the model designed to be Hitler's own grandiose city which he would bring them to his place of birth for display.

The separate episodes concerning Vincent van Gogh and someone actually discovering a new portrait he had done along with the missing Vermeers of Delft were equally mindboggling and how their works could have been swept under the rug if not for some purely amazing people. Then, in another, we understand about how the intriguing Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" actually goes missing from the Louvre? Within each of these historical and visual episodes, you will be able to see how history is captured through the artwork of the time which for me was a delightful parallel. I found every episode to be quite an extremely researched work: an enlightening and narrated view which I have watched over and over...",1457654400,13,3605,4.820678513731825
