1843945,2,B00008G8BO,"DID finish watching, but a pretty stupid and boring movie. Nothing new or refreshing here. Dialogue, story and acting silly, (and I'm a classically trained musician and music lover). Poor Molly...not realistic at all as ""sophisticated"" much less mature.",1429401600,,253,5.512820512820513
1843946,4,B00008G8BO,"Ok, for the sake of full disclosure, I must admit that I've been in love w/ Molly Ringwald ever since first seeing her in SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB. There, I said it, and have no shame about it! REQUIEM FOR MURDER has Ms. Ringwald as Anne Winslow, a DJ for a classical music radio station in Philadelphia. Unbeknownst to her, someone is murdering people, while listening to her show. Now, police are looking for the clues that could help them track this lunatic down, before Anne finds herself in grave danger. Filled to bursting w/ possible suspects, and boatloads of red herrings, RFM holds its own as a murder mystery / thriller. Obviously, Molly Ringwald adds much to the production. The finale, complete w/ 1812 OVERTURE accompaniment, is brilliant! Be still my heart...",1428624000,,788,4.844444444444444
1843947,2,B00008G8BO,This movie felt like a meh made for TV mystery; one of those that you keep watching in the hopes that it will get better.  It was flat and you knew that the actual 'baddie' was NEVER going to be the heavy handed suspects.,1427068800,,221,4.0227272727272725

1843949,3,B00008G8BO,"First saw this film on TV a few years ago, and really enjoyed it. Second time round, however, it's not quite as thrilling, but perhaps the DVD version has been edited?",1418169600,,167,4.419354838709677

1843951,3,B00008G8BO,"This is in my view not a class A film and its plot was done in several other movies, but it was ok. We see  several murders committed and after awhile a police officer realizes that they are related to a classical music radio announcer. There are several suspects and as many red herrings.",1412812800,,289,4.351851851851852
1843952,4,B00008G8BO,"I enjoyed ""Requiem for Murder"", but you have to understand a few things going in. It's a low-budget movie, so forget about seeing special effects or cutting-edge cinemetography. It's also a slow-building mystery, so the pacing is languid.

If you have a problem with either of those two facts, better skip this film. But for anyone willing to overlook a few shortcomings, ""Requiem"" is a treat, featuring an excellent, understated performance by Molly Ringwald as Anne Winslow, the top-rated classical DJ in Chicago.

The plot revolves around a killer who seems to be obsessed with / stalking Winslow, leaving clues at each murder that point unerringly toward some connection between the two. The movie presents a string of characters moving into and out of Anne's life, any one of whom could be the deranged psycho.

Ringwald plays Winslow as cold and aloof, a ""victim"" who's very hard to like. It's a convincing and atypical performance by the former Brat Packer, who usually plays accessible, likeable, girl-next-door types.

""Requiem for Murder"" uses classical music to set the mood for the crime drama, as Anne Winslow's playing of various classical pieces on her radio show is the soundtrack to the killer's nefarious deeds. The atmosphere created is quite good, and enhances the ""whodunnit"" aspect of the mystery.

Overall, this DVD is well worth the purchase price, but don't go in expecting a thrill-packed movie - the film is laid-back yet still creates suspense on a low budget.",1110844800,10,1488,5.057142857142857

7982942,2,B00008G8BO,"I love movies that include the soft sensuous voices we hear over late night radio.  Nothing so mysterious and sexy and in that regard this movie didn't disappoint, but my time would have been better spent simply turning on the radio.  If you like that sort of thing watch Play Misty for Me, Now that was great!  This film was bad!!! The two main characters Molly Ringwald and Christopher Heyerdahl seemed to be in two different films.  Ringwald was stiff and uncomfortable to watch.  Heyerdahl seemed to be playing it for laughs.  But after putting up with the slow story and tired plot the ending was completely disappointing.  SPOILER ALERT-read no further if you want to see the movie.  Nothing is as unfair in a murder mystery as to have the murderer turn out to be someone who had absolutely no part in the film until he is revealed at the end.",1435968000,,849,4.5394736842105265

7982945,3,B00008G8BO,"I expected Molly Ringwald to show some acting talent in this movie, but it didn't happen. The plot was a bit strange as well. If you're patient and can overlook stilted acting from Ringwald, you might enjoy the film. I didn't.",1433721600,,226,4.536585365853658
7982946,1,B00008G8BO,"Spectacularly bad movie--bad writing, bad acting, bad everything.",1432857600,,65,7.25
7982947,2,B00008G8BO,"This film is worth passing by; almost every cheap cliche' was tastelessly dumped into a movie that plundered on and on: the red roses and red wine have been used in hundreds of detective movies, of course you have the wine snob and list of infatuated fans slobbering over Ringwald, who seems like a ditsy teen, rather than a sex object. The acting was terrible, the sets boring, and dull, uninventive camera work. I'm so tired of the male characters who possess a charming knowledge of unusually rare wines, and the sheik restaurants, as well as each being somehow abnormally brilliant! What a waste; even down to an ending I easily predicted. Don't waste your timeRingwald falls short of 'Pretty in Pink'!",1431993600,,706,4.795081967213115
