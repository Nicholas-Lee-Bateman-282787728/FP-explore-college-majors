I started Kettlebell workout 4 months ago and was looking for new routine.
This DVD has several premixes that are awsome. They are not too much and not boring.

6781000,5,B00P1PB2N8,"This is a good, safe kettlebell workout for those of us who are not ""expert"" kettlebell users. It works the whole body well (although I feel workout one is harder than workout two), but does not have some of the more complicated kettlebell moves (like snatches) that  can be difficult to master. This is my favorite of Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness DVDs, and I have several.",1419120000,9,374,4.582089552238806
6781001,5,B00P1PB2N8,"I have several of Kelly's DVDs but I've never used a kettlebell and didn't know what to expect, but I'm loving it!  It's a blast.  The day after I was definitely feeling it but in a good way.  I rotate several types of workouts, mostly Kelly's plus others like the 30 day shred and pilates but this is my new favorite.  It's doing a great job of toning and sculpting all over. There are two kettlebell workouts plus a big choice of pre mixes so you'll never get bored. There are options for working on cardio, abs, upper body, lower body etc. If your very fit, go heavier and if not just follow the person doing the modified moves.  You can also use a dumbbell if you don't have a kettlebell. This is a great for all levels of fitness.",1415577600,8,735,4.2214285714285715
6781002,5,B00P1PB2N8,Good video and solid workout.  I have a few other Kelly Coffey-Meyer video's and like them all but this one is one of my favorites.  Increasing your kettle bell weight will make this a usable video for a long time.,1509753600,,214,4.325

6781004,5,B00P1PB2N8,"Love this DVD! I've been doing kettlebells with DVDs for about 15 years. It wasn't until this DVD that I realized I didn't have the correct form. Kelly walks you through the correct form and it works. I was sore after this DVD, all those years of doing kettlebells I never felt this sore. To achieve maximum results your form must be correct.",1508716800,,342,4.444444444444445
6781005,5,B00P1PB2N8,"I love this video. It's the best fitness DVD that I have purchased in quite a while. Kelly is very positive, and doesn't waste time jabbering. The workouts are as advertised; she does not do any extreme or difficult kettlebell moves. The novice kettlebell user could easily keep up, if in shape. I would rate this just below advanced in terms of exertion. It is comparable to the Bob Harper or Jillian Michaels kettlebell workouts, but seems to move along a little faster.",1505865600,2,472,4.698795180722891
6781006,4,B00P1PB2N8,"I like this workout. There are 2 different 30-minute workouts that compliment each other well along with other mix choices, using the same moves, for varying time lengths that you can try.  I've only done the two 30-minute options so far.

I wish I would've gotten a different choice of 30-Minutes-to-Fitness workouts because I'm not all that crazy about the kettlebell.  I use an 8-lb dumbbell which works fine for these moves and gives me an okay workout. I like the countdowns to the end of each circuit. I also like her style and the way she talks. She reminds you to hold in your abs, which is a direction I can always use. So next workout purchase will be another one with her.

I have many workouts and like to do different ones every day. This one fits in nicely with my selections, although I have others I like better. This one isn't the most challenging or the least challenging in my workout library.

The reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it's not all that challenging, I'm not crazy about kettlebell workouts, and I like others much better.  I do plan to try another Kelly Coffey-Meyer 30 Minute workout the next time I want to add another workout to my routines.",1505174400,,1187,4.497674418604651
6781007,3,B00P1PB2N8,"This is ok, I have others I like better",1503792000,,39,3.4444444444444446

6781009,5,B00P1PB2N8,"I wish I could give more stars for this workout because I would.  I have several kettle bell DVDs that I like a lot, but none of them has given me the personal satisfaction that this workout DVD has and here's why.

I personally don't like a lot of cardio built in to my strength training workouts.  I have my own cardio routine that follows my strength training.  In addition, I also don't want a lot of choreography.  Just give me a good strength workout and I am good.  This workout does just that.  And for 30 minutes, you get a VERY good workout.

None of the moves are complicated and because you get breaks in between each set (normally 4 sets unless you're working each arm or each leg, then it's two sets on each side), you CAN workout with a heavier weight, which, as we all know, will a) sculpt you quicker; b) increase muscle mass which in turn burns more calories which means increased weight loss; and c) for those who might find the routine ""basic"" being able to go up to a 25 pound bell/weight, will give you that extra punch that you need.  In addition to the above, for me, this workout doesn't leave me feeling like I was ""beat up"" in the workout sense.  Don't get me wrong, I feel sore, but it's that good sore that I always heard about, but never quite felt or understood until now (smile).

As stated, because you're not swinging the bell all over the place with a lot of choreographed moves, you can use a heavy weight.  Normally, when trying a new kettle bell routine, I tend to use 5 pounds just to get a feel.  However, I could have easily started with 10.  For reference, Kelly uses 15 pounds and she struggles on a couple of the moves.  That's how good of a workout you get.

In addition to Kelly, there are three others in the class with one individual using a dumbbell instead of kettle bell.  She also tends to do the modified moves, which is another plus if you're not able to do the more challenging moves.  Mind you, there are not too many, but it's nice to have the option  in case you need it.

Kelly's cues are spot on, plus, in the background, there's a recorded voice that let's you know when the set is complete and it's time to rest and when you're about to begin again.

I can't say enough good things about this workout.  I, like a lot of people, have long work days and when I get home, the last thing I want to do is workout.  However, this 30 minute workout packs such a good punch and because it's also a workout that's enjoyable, it won't be hard to motivate myself when I get home.  Highly recommend!",1496620800,12,2549,4.2625

6781015,4,B00P1PB2N8,"I bought this video because I could never get to the gym when one of the trainers were there.  I needed to add weight resistance to my work out for muscle firmness but more important to increase bone health, increase endorphins and increase my metabolism by 15% to help me get those few extra pounds off.  The work outs were well paced and gave different options of ways to modify if you were not ready for the weight or pace.  I had used weights before and found the kettle ball a little unruly at first.  It was a good work out, I am just partial to using individual weights.",1481328000,,577,4.26605504587156

I plan to rotate both videos now to work different muscles and to prevent boredom.  Great instruction and Safety is First!

I didn't like it the first time I did it, but gave it a chance and tried it again and found I did like the pacing, timing and exercises. If you're really into kettlebells then you may not like this workout, it's more of a mix between traditional kettlebell workouts and a mixed cardio/dumbell based workout.

Very nicely paced, quite challenging with right weights and form. Kelly Coffey-Meyer is her usual friendly, encouraging, and professional self. Her instructions and cue-ing are very good, on point, and clear. I finally did pay  very close attention to her form, pace, and guidance, and this workout left me fully worked and satisfied. There is no jumping around (except for some  jacks), there are some excellent balance exercises, and  this is indeed a straightforward, effective KB workout - which I do with a dumbbell.

It was quick!  But you don't have to workout for an hour if it's intense, and depending on the weight of the kettlebell you use, it's as intense as you want it to be.  I liked her form, and the repetitions.  I hate jumping around and it was really limited (the jumping).

I bought 2 dvd's from her, and have yet to try the other, but if this one is any indication I will definitely be buying more.

Kelly makes the program easy to follow.  Each move is repeated 4 times with short 15 seconds break in between.  This set-up makes me feel I can get through it and not bored.  I switch between 10-15kg kettlebells during the 60 pre-mixed workout depending on the moves.  It is as good as Jillian Michael's options!  It definitely makes me sweat!

I LOVE these 2 Kelly Coffey kettlebell videos! They're fast paced so no move gets boring. 30 minutes flys by. I've used kettlebells before but didn't have my own, so I started this workout with an 8&15lb dumbbell to make sure I liked the video before buying a kettlebell. Now I'm doing the workouts with a 15lb kettlebell and I've purchased a 25lb one that I plan on using for the swings & some other exercises.
By the end of the workout, I'm sweating and my muscles are quivering. Yet, I still have energy and I'm not unreasonably sore the next day. (I attribute that to the nature of the kettlebell workouts- which is great!)
I look forward to doing this video which is saying a lot! I can already see muscle definition and I've only been doing it a few weeks. Another added bonus is kettlebell workouts are really cardio and strength combined so you get a great overall workout.",1443312000,21,1143,4.421800947867299

of these videos, great trainer. My core has never been stronger an I am in middle age",1430265600,3,232,4.295454545454546
6781066,5,B00P1PB2N8,"Received as a gift.  Love the work out.  Especially love that it is not a wimpy pretend kettle bell workout.  The workouts are both fun and challenging.  The premixes all have a warm up and cool down included so there is no awkward stop the video after the workout and switch to the cool down. In addition to the built in pre-mixes, I like using the disc with VLC media player as it will allow you to randomly select chapters so the workout is a total surprise.  Either way you key it up you will get a good workout in under 40 minutes except for the 2 mixes that combine two full workouts. Kelly is using a 15lb bell throughout, I was able to do the workout with a 20lb bell with no problems.  I found the 25lb bell a little much on the upper body mix.",1430265600,3,753,4.08843537414966
6781067,5,B00P1PB2N8,"This is exactly what I was looking for a moderately paced kettle bell work out that allowed me to use a heavier bell without compromising my form. The previously workout I had were too fast paced with complicated foot work and if I used a bell over 5 pounds my form would suffer. So I was not getting strength and cardio--just cardio. This work out is moderately paced so you can actually use a heavy bell and no fancy foot work. There are modifications for beginners. I think a beginner could use this and just add heavier bells as it becomes easier. Great variety of pre mixes as well. You really have 6 (I think if not more) work outs on one dvd. If you like splits the dvd is also broken into upper and lower work outs. Good value for the money.
 Kelly is also very motivating and not annoying. No high pitched yells or preaching. I love it when she  says at exactly the moment you want to give up, ""Come on, get it.""  Plus, she is very conscious to remind you to keep your form and protect your back. I did the full body premix today without the floor work, it was tough but not overkill. I love that I can get my strength in with my cardio, with just one work out.  I am excited to explore all my premix options.",1428624000,3,1218,4.170212765957447

6781069,5,B00P1PB2N8,"I really did enjoy this dvd,as many kettlebell dvds have serious dread factor and Kelly makes it challenging,yet enjoyable to do. Because the workouts are split,I usually choose to do 1 30 minute workout and then may add a 15 minute cardio segment from another dvd. Kettlebells tend to make me feel more worked then when I use weights,so I usually get tired after more then 30 minutes. As far as strength training,I really do think Kelly is 1 of the best trainers,as she has many innovative moves not seen in other dvds,and she has a very engaging and supportive personality.",1426464000,7,575,4.702970297029703

6781071,5,B00P1PB2N8,"I really like this kettlebell DVD. The exercises are timed, so you can go at your own pace, or just do 1 or 2 of the exercises in each set, or do every other exercise alternating advanced with beginner, lots of premixes too. I go faster on swings, but with it timed, that is not a problem. There are lots of ways to work this DVD, it is fun, and it goes by fast, you are like, ""What? It's over already? Lots of room to grow with this one, just go with a heavier kettlebell when the moves get to easy. That will be easy to do with timed segments. Get this, you will not be disappointed.",1423094400,3,585,4.0085470085470085
8686078,5,B00P1PB2N8,"I just ordered this, I own several Kelly Dvds & this was quite a challenge for me.  I bought a 10lb. kettlebell and I have never done a kettlebell workout, this one was hard!! I would suggest beginners start with a 5 lb kettlebell first or go lighter if you haven't exercised in awhile.  This one packs a serious punch, I was really soaked with sweat on workout #1, workout #2 was just as tough!!! Doing this several times a week, youll be in great shape!!!!",1532390400,,458,4.313953488372093

8686084,4,B00P1PB2N8,"I'm a Kelly fan. I like her no-nonsense style and encouraging-but-not-annoying personality. I've never done kettlebells before and I found the moves easy to follow for the most part. No where on the DVD cover does it tell you what weight to use. At some point in the middle of the workout she mentions she's using 15. I bought a 10 because she is very in shape and seemed to struggle at certain points. I decided 10 was too easy after my first attempt and ended up buying a 15 (on Amazon). It's definitely a challenge but a good one.  How it is set up: you do one move for 30 secs with 15 sec rest. You repeat that for a total of 4 times in a row. I thought when I first previewed this that it would be boring and tedious but I find it actually goes by at a nice pace. Like all her DVDs there are two 30 minute workouts. I have only done the first one so far. I usually like to alternate between the two for a period of time and then build up to doing the whole hour. Its a good way to measure your progress and even if you only do one 30 minute session, you know you're getting in a good workout for the day. I mostly feel it in my triceps and ALL around my legs the next day which are the two things I want to focus on at the moment. I know if I keep up with this once or twice a week I will see changes.",1519084800,,1306,3.873134328358209

8686087,2,B00P1PB2N8,"Received the video as scheduled, decided to watch the complete tape to see what I needed and where to begin, well let's just say the workout is not for someone just starting out. Don't get me wrong once I get to an advance level then yes but there is no instructions on kettlebell Suze weight or if you can do alternative positions, even as far as to start and stopping after 30 min. I found the tape to be too much for me just starting out so I ordered kettlebell for beginners. Will do a review on it real soon. This is my honest opinion.",1514332800,,540,4.152380952380953
