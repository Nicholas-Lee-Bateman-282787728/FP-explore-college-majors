2653465,5,B000I7LSI8,"DVD arrived quickly in great condition.  I love Zorro, especially the Disney version; this Zorro was one of my childhood heroes.  I'm so glad it is at last available on DVD.",1225584000,2,173,4.548387096774194
2653466,5,B000I7LSI8,"""Zorro"" is one of rare TV series that serves adults and kids very well. Guy Williams is always remarkable, as the co-stars, in this incredible and eternal production.
I wonder why the second season is not avaiable on DVD yet.
The only thing that I didn't like about this realease, is the fact that Disney- it seems- does not have the proper respect regarding Zorro. There are no extras, no interviews of any kind, or production pictures. I recomend a very good book about it: ""The Zorro Television Company"", written by Gerry Dooley. Very interesting indeed.",1208044800,4,557,4.8125
2653467,4,B000I7LSI8,"I love the Zorro episodes!  I wish both the colorized and BW versions were on the same DVDs.  I think having a ""How it was made"" clip would have really been special too.  Of course, we don't know what legal issues may have been occurring behind the scenes even to get these released on DVD.  I'm satisfied that the video is stable and clear, unlike my old VHS tapes.",1196121600,2,366,4.260869565217392
2653468,3,B000I7LSI8,"If you prefer to watch the series in the original form of black and white, I do not suggest these DVDs.  I loved the series, but this colorized version is pretty poor quality.  Not all parts of each frame were colorized, and fade-in/fade-out scenes are sometimes missed.  As for the price, if you are not a member of the Disney Movie Club yet, you can get the entire 1st season(all 5 DVDs) for under $35, however, you'll be required to buy 4 more DVDs from the Club in the next 2 years at full price.  Really not a bad deal, since the regular price of each DVD is now $22.  Hopefully they'll release the next season within the next 2 years, and the obligation will be fulfilled by purchasing the next season of Zorro.

Zorro Series - 5 Stars
Colorized Quality - 3 Stars
Fact that there is no choice between B&W and Color - 1 Star",1185494400,8,829,4.248407643312102
2653469,5,B000I7LSI8,"While Antonio Banderas did a good job portraying Johnston McCulley's most famous character, ""Zorro"" in the 1998 release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-of-Zorro/dp/6305182493/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mask of Zorro</a>, there is still only one ""Zorro."" The story has been done many times, by many actors, but none as well as the late Guy Williams.

&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walt-Disney-s-Zorro-Season-1-Volume-2/dp/B000I7LSI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walt Disney's Zorro - Season 1 - Volume 2</a>&nbsp;aired as a TV series from 1957 to 1959 and really launched the career of Guy Williams as a leading man and put ""Zorro"" on the map, as it were. Mr. Disney must have had a vision because he was right on the money. Williams (born Armando Catalano) understood and interpreted the dashing avenging hero of the people, set in old California during the Spanish rule. An accomplished fencer, Williams stepped right into a role that was tailor-made. Williams not only had the ""look,"" but more importantly exuded the charm and panache of Don Diego de la Vega's alter ego. It's obvious that Williams was having fun.

In typical Disney fashion, the series derived its comical relief from ""Bernardo"" played by Gene Sheldon, ""Sgt. Garcia"" played by Henry Calvin, and villany from ""Capitan Monastario"" portrayed by Britt Lomond.

McCulley's story has it all - history, romance, horses, haciendas, and action-adventure. And Williams' portrayal was so vigorous, that boys across America were fencing in their backyards with plastic swords,  running up street and down alley scratching ""Z's"" into every surface, and driving their mothers crazy. Zorro popped up as Ben Cooper Halloween costumes, on pajamas and lunch boxes. The marketing machine was in full swing with the Zorro fervor and demand. And Williams' Zorro still lives on in other parts of the world including Argentina where Williams retired.

It's about time we see the real Zorro on DVD and even if we have to buy the entire series in installments, that's okay. We have at least moved past viewing the old videos.",1181779200,8,2170,5.747663551401869
2653470,5,B000I7LSI8,"Beginning with the very comical story of the ""fair Trial"" (featuring Sebastian Cabot as the overeating judge who beats Sgt. Garcia in an eating ""contest""), this selection takes us to the end of Monastario's reign and sets up for a new storyline.  In an already great series, this is an excellent sellection of episodes, better than the first DVD.  Worth every penny, and lots of fun.",1178582400,5,383,4.787878787878788
2653471,5,B000I7LSI8,"Buyer Beware:  These are NOT different episodes from those that Guy Williams' fans already have on VHS tapes.  Each of the VHS tapes (released years ago) had a title for each tape (which contained about 6 episodes each).  Those titles do NOT appear on these dvds.  However, they are the exact same episodes.

What you get are ""new"" colorized copies and better picture quality (although the VHS tapes were fine quality).

I'm not knocking these dvds.  I just want to pass along this warning.  I may not have jumped at the Christmas gift of a ""deal"" on all 6 dvds had I known that I was not getting any new episodes.

All of that said, Guy Williams is masterful in every way in this series.  His allegedly deaf valet steals the show many times.  Sgt. Garcia is the Sgt. Schultz (Hogan's Heroes) of this series.  It all works, in every episode.

For you fans who followed Guy Williams from here into the additionally immortal Lost In Space TV series, there is another treat in here.  Jonathan Harris (Dr. Zachary Smith on Lost In Space) appears in the Mountain Man set of episodes, as a dastardly, conniving sneak.  I guess someone saw how well he did it, and signed him up as the permanent ""Special Guest Star"" on Lost In Space.

Guy Williams died of a brain aneurism, in 1989 in Argentina.  Though born in the Bronx, he had reportedly felt burned by Hollywood.  After relocating to Argentina, he did some work with a traveling circus as Zorro.  In Hollywood, he had also starred as Sinbad and as the sword-wielding Miles Hendon in a Disney version of The Prince and the Pauper.

Guy Williams was the first of the Lost In Space actors to die, followed only recently by Jonathan Harris.  Sadly, their first public reunion was after 1989.

Guy Williams, born Armando Joseph Catalano, may have been one of the most untapped strong-male (a true 6'3"") lead actors that Hollywood neglected, to their loss and ours.",1167955200,42,1906,4.6101190476190474
2653472,5,B000I7LSI8,"E. Davis said: ""I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't distribute it directly, but was able to order it from a Marketplace seller.""

Here is why:
Amazon doesn't distribute this directly because it (along with the other 4 DVDs of season 1) is currently a Disney Movie Club ""Exclusive Title"" (This is indicated by a gold logo in the lower right corner of the cover).  This means the only ""official"" place you can purchase this is through that venue (currently at half the cost of most Marketplace sellers).  The Marketplace sellers are obtaining theirs from a membership they have or through another DMC member.  This violates a portion of the agreement you make when you join the Disney Movie Club which states: ""Membership is intended for personal use only. Movies purchased through the Disney Movie Club are not intended for resale or other commercial purposes.""

That said... This is an EXCELLENT series!  While this IS a colorized version and my preferences run towared the original B/W it is some of the best colorization I've seen.  I'm looking forward to the second season.",1166140800,15,1072,4.889502762430939
2653473,5,B000I7LSI8,"I was delighted to learn of the availability of this great series. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't distribute it directly, but was able to order it from a Marketplace seller. However, I wish that Amazon would have linked it to Season One: Vols. 2,3, and 4, which I found through a customer's Zorro Listmania, and was able to order from the same Marketplace seller. It would have been nice to order all volumes at once, and if it wasn't for the customer's Listmania, I wouldn't have known the other volumes were available. 5 Stars for Disney's Zorro series, 3.5 Stars to Amazon for keeping customers in the dark.",1164585600,8,611,4.614678899082569
2653474,5,B000I7LSI8,"When I was a kid, Guy Williams was (and will be forever) the real Zorro.  I never missed an episode.  The stories are exciting and fun with lots of humor and a supporting cast that has never been surpassed.  Everyone is here - lovable Sgt. Garcia, clever Bernardo, the ""wicked"" Commendante (who somehow never seemed quite mean enough, however dastardly his deeds), crusty Don Alejandro, and the horse,Tornado. Missing is the dim-witted Corproal Reyes, but he didn't show up this early in the series, so just wait a while and he'll show up.  What more could I ask?  True, some purists may be unhappy with the colorized episodes in place of the original black & white, but the colorization here is not bad, and does nothing to detract.  Enjoy this Disney classic!  There are four more discs for season one, and you will surely want these as well.",1157760000,24,844,4.662162162162162

8144292,1,B000I7LSI8,"Although I am fanatic of the Zorro since was a child, I must point out that I am deeply disappointed with this particular product. If you are set on the part of the details of product, clearly mentions that the same is available in Spanish language, but it is false. The product does not bring these specifications in the back, as with other products Disney, nor even with subtitles. Nor can it be changed to Spanish language using the remote control.

What is sadder still, the seller ""thelastcinema"" has not wanted to respond positively when I reclaimed on this particular. In more than 10 years by purchasing in this place I had ever experienced a treatment so unpleasant with a seller such as this. I urge you to be careful with their purchases in particular if this is the seller (thelascinema) so you will not have future problems.

I clarified that my expressions in have nothing to do with the Company Amazon, which have always provided me a service of excellence. My comments only concern to de seller mentioned above.",1311033600,2,1027,4.7
