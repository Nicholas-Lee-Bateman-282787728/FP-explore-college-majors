8007519,3,B00016XOAQ,"The entire series DVD sets are better, but if you can't afford or don't want to buy the entire series, then this is a good DVD to have. Unfortunately, unlike the VHS release of ""Poison Ivy"", this DVD release does not include the alternate intro. Just the same intro included on the entire series DVD sets. But it still has four great episodes on it. Two featuring Poison Ivy and two featuring the Penguin.

Episodes: Eternal Youth, Birds of a Feather, The Mechanic, House and Garden.",1439769600,,483,4.616279069767442

8007522,2,B00016XOAQ,"Great for the casual fan, or older kids.  The DVD actually collects 4 episodes of Batman The Animated Series, and is not 2 features as described.  If you already have the season sets this offers nothing new.",1336176000,,207,4.5675675675675675

8007524,2,B00016XOAQ,"What are they doing? This fantastic cartoon, along with Batman the Animated Tales deserves it's own box set. The amount of work that went into this show created an allegiance of fans, all of who are desperate to get their hands on season sets rather than single episodes.
They did it for Transformers, why can't they do it for Batman?
Please release a box set Warner Bros. You know you can, and you know we want it. So hurry up!
I refuse to buy this unless I am sure that this is the only D.V.D format that it will be released in. I am assuming that I am not the only one.",1082419200,3,572,4.116071428571429
