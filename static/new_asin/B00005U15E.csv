1662898,3,B00005U15E,"I watched this movie on video because i am a fan of the star of the movie Corey Haim,i must say the movie was a not to bed movie some of the acting was camp and cheesy but Haim normally plays good roles in his movie's and he did in this one. The only problem is that the script loses things like the school only seems to have about 50 students in it and Haim has to take out all the bad guys with some very clever technique's the science lab scene for one is a good one you have to watch it to find out i reccomend it for Corey fans because if you just watch it you might find it terrible because the cast is pretty unknown.",1007510400,2,624,3.8449612403100777
1662899,5,B00005U15E,"When I first seen this movie,it was on HBO.I was checking out the T.V. Guide one night and saw Corey Haim's name on the page and flipped to the channel. I only got to see the end of the movie though but what I saw, I liked. Now it's in my wish list and one day I'll buy it.  Later,

7954033,5,B00005U15E,Being a product of the 80's I really love the Corey's. I figured that this would be totally cheese ball and good for a few laughs. I am happy to say that I was completely wrong. This is really a great movie with a plausible plot and great action. I would definitely recommend it.,1508544000,,279,4.185185185185185
7954034,1,B00005U15E,"Everything is bad about this movie. However, with one hot guy and one hot girl, would have been better as a porn movie. In fact this movie is so bad otherwise that it should not even receive one star. Pardon me, the photography was excellent. Too bad these stars are not broken down by category.",1471651200,,295,4.381818181818182

7954039,5,B00005U15E,"I'd call this Corey Haim's comeback performance. He's been in so many cheesy films, we had all wondered. Seeing school students held hostage by terrorist is amazing until one transfer boy from New York saved everybody. It was gorey seeing on terrorist got his head in a band saw. I loved seeing the lady terrorist get stabbed by a bunch of pencils shot from a fire extinguisher.",1136332800,5,378,4.656716417910448

7954041,1,B00005U15E,"After seeing this on TMC a few years back, my grandfather would dress as the terrorists from this movie.  At the dinner table, he'd jump on table top with a super soaker full of you-know-what and squirt it in my guests' faces yelling random puns that weren't really funny.

Then, he would run out of the room, change costume to Alan Thicke and then ""save"" me and my guests from the terrorists.  Once he held my Cousin Alfie hostage for 6 days without food or water. Did I mention he also turned the whole interior of our home into a high school so his games would be more ""realistic?""

Last year, we had to put Granddad to sleep. He was losing control of his bladder. We buried him in 3d glasses. This movie wasn't in 3d, but he wouldve wanted it that way and I deduct a few stars for that alone.",1104364800,2,796,4.217105263157895
7954042,1,B00005U15E,"""When a group of terrorists (led by Luther) take over a high school making the students in it their hostages, it is up to several of the students (led by Lenny) to help prevent disaster while the authorities (Slater and General Wainwright) do their part on the other side.""

(keep in mind, there is no mention of Alan Thicke or Corey Haim)

Ok, I digress...

This is going to be more like a super paragraph...

Demoltion High has taught me many things.  The most important thing I have learned from Demolition High is that suicide is an option.  An option that director Jim Wynorski should have taken before this movie was released.  I will never dismiss a movie for bad acting.  It happens.  you can have a movie with terrible acting, and the premise is still ok.  However,  this movie contains NO acting.  In the first few scenes, about 23 children are herded into a gym to be taken hostage.  The terrorist are walking around with ak47's, and no one thinks it is strange, except for Cory haim who actually says ""something about this does not seem right""!!! Well back to no acting.  The children sit in the gym, looking almost bored with the terrorists as they shoot into the air all around them.  I think I even caught a girl in the back yawning at one point.  Not only is it the worst dialogue ever written, it actually makes the CT cast of high school dogs look like brad pitt and george clooney interacting in oceans eleven.

Now on to story.  It is a can't miss plot.  Terrorist take over a school.  We have seen it before, but it always works right?  WRONG!  First off, school is out for the day, only 23 students are taken hostage.  The new hotshot detective in town (thicke) actually has a son in the building (haim), add to this the worst acting school bully ever.  EVER.  Like acutally the worst school bully ever.  I can not stress this enough.  Makes Pinto look like Johnny Lawrence (KK).  Add the terrible acting to the terrible un-scared teens involved, I mean these kids could care less about the terrorists, keep in mind there are only four terrorists in the movie (they pull up in a white car and shot like 50 cops, with a great ""line"" every time they pull the trigger), yet when it all goes down there are like a million in the school.  The terrorists have no demands, or reason to even be there.  They are just there.  Like I am not kiding, there is never any cop/terrorist phone calls.  The cops just try to get the kids out.  It is really bizzare.  I would love to tell you how this movie ended, because like I said I had to turn it off with like 4 minutes left.  Who does that? I watched the whole thing, and it really got THAT UNBEARABLE with 4 minutes left I could not finish it.  I assume, all the terrorists die in a bizarre manner, like a grease fire, and Haim gets the girl.  Which may be difficult because there is not even a girl in the movie.

I really cant describe just how bad it is, and to make it worse, I was looking for a bad review, and all I could find are glowing rants about how great it was.  You NEED to rent this.  No, Steal it.  If you rent it the director may find out and make another movie.",1104278400,3,3140,4.290102389078498
