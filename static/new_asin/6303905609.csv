The film begins with a dice game, the table has a revolver. The lights go out, someone shoots that pistol! We see a cowboy singing about gambling. Gene notices the tracks in the road. Larry Evans is hiding in an isolated cabin. Gene walks in , he is looking for the man who killed his friend Ed Norton. Gene will ""cloud their trail"" to help Larry and Mary escape. Sheriff Cramer drops by with a posse, and disarms Gene. There is another song. Then a fast ride by Larry and Mary. Gene catches Larry, there is a fight. Gene's horse has a mind of its own. A ear to the ground picks up sounds. Gene sings about round-up time in Texas. Later the posse comes by and chase Gene and Larry into the hills. Gene has a plan to escape pursuit. The Sheriff talks to Mary, who knows how to keep silent.

At night Gene and Larry visit a friend. Larry tells who advised him to put his pistol on the table. Gene sings another song. Mason offers his help to Mary, he wants to buy their ranch. [A clue to the killing?] Mason has been very kind to Mary. But Gene is seen leaving, the sheriff and others follow him. Is there an echo in the valley? Jim Hedges' cabin is empty. They follow the horse tracks. The man on guard fights with Gene (for more action). Is ""post office"" a kid's game? Back in town there is a sociable gathering. Men grow beards for the old-timer's day celebration. Gene sings again. Men want to dance with Mary (a young and beautiful heiress). Who shot at Gene? Who wants to buy the Evans' ranch? Is Larry too suspicious? Gene visits the Evans ranch. Larry wants more trouble. [Note how a revolver with a swing-out cylinder reloads faster than a fixed cylinder revolver?] The old prospector Jim Hedges says there is no gold or silver on the ranch. Another shot at Gene!

Jim Hedges' compass swings wildly. The sheriff rides up to arrest Larry. They recreate the crime, and are able to solve the murder, a conspiracy among those who wanted the Evans and Norton ranches. The killer tries to get away on a stagecoach. There is a chase, Gene catches up, and they fight. The sheriff arrives to arrest the guilty. There is another song, and a happy ending.

This film is more of a murder mystery than a conflict over land and wealth. There is a wrongfully accused man. Land with iron ore should have been noticed years earlier. Note the fewer number of actors in this longer film. ""Larry Evans"" seems to be a hot-head who attracts trouble like a magnet. In earlier films Gene won the girl at the end. I suspect they used a double for Gene's fight scenes, but I'm not sure. Why are there so many scenes where Gene surrenders his pistol?",1290211200,,2657,4.383367139959432
7854182,5,6303905609,"Though this film receives little air time it still remains one of Gene Autry's best films.  A combination of humor and mystery with a winning song, Loaded Pistols, will please any Autry fan.  And Barbara Britton had to be one of his better looking and acting leading ladies.

Chill Wills fills the role of the town sheriff to a tee, even though at home his wife rules the roost.  Though the sheriff always seems to be taking Gene's gun away from him, Gene eventually comes out on top in the end. Watch that echo canyon.

This DVD doesn't have the best quality to it, quite typical with Alpha Video, but since this film isn't available anywhere else yet, it is the 'only game in town'.  If, however, you are fortunate enough to have seen the film on ENCORE westerns and filmed it, you will have a digitally restored film.

This truly for me is one of Gene's better films. Never tire of watching it.

Best in viewing, pards.

4-3-14  Note:  This film is now also available as GENE AUTRY COLLECTION 5, along with 3 other films.  These films are fully restored and are comprised of 2 DVD Video Sets.  Love mine. Collection 6 is due out in May, 2014.  Each has four films of Gene, all fully restored, and great value from Amazon for the price.",1141171200,5,1238,4.420353982300885
7854183,5,6303905609,"As an avid Autry collector, this is one of my favorite movies.  It is full of action and songs!  Gene helps to clear a young man framed for murder and of course he manages to win the affections of his sister, Mary.  One of the musical highlights of this show is when Gene sings ""When The Bloom Is On The Sage"".  This show is a mixture of action, a little comedy and a touch of romance....When he sings ""Pretty Mary"" to Barbara Britton in this show, what lady would not love to have Gene sing that to her. As usual, Gene uses his wit and wisdom to solve this murder mystery and ends with a chase and a fight scene in the end. This movie also shows how well trained Champion was and that he was his masters best friend!! Great Autry Entertainment!! Highly recommended by this Collector........",1009756800,6,791,4.324324324324325
