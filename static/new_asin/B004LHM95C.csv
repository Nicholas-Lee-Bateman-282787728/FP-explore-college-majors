There are 46 of us this winter, and cant imagine only having a crew of 8! Though the subtitles are way off, it just seems to make it even funnier!! The changes you go through here are displayed in the movie and some of the situations portrayed also happened our winter!!",1508371200,,375,4.371428571428571
8434397,1,B004LHM95C,The English subtitles are unusable. For such an amazing film it is quite a shame. If you know Japanese it may be worth buying.,1484438400,,126,4.291666666666667
8434398,5,B004LHM95C,"Great movie, highly recommend it.",1456012800,,33,5.8
8434399,5,B004LHM95C,"This movie is based on a series of essays that was written by an ex-Japan coast guard officer who went to Antarctica as a cook, so you can get a glimpse of the life there through some funny episodes (mostly related to food). I watched it in Japanese and enjoyed every scene of it, but if the English subtitles are that bad as some reviewers say, that's really sad...",1418083200,,366,4.318840579710145
8434400,5,B004LHM95C,"I spent seven seasons working in Antarctica and absolutely loved this film. The English subtitles were a bit off, but they were better than my Japanese! This is also the only film that I know of that gives you a truly accurate picture of life on a research station in a comedy/drama format...everything else is either a documentary or a sci-fi/horror. A truly excellent movie.",1411171200,,376,4.8
8434401,2,B004LHM95C,"have seen the original movie with English subtitles, I have some knowledge of Japanese language and found this dvd's English interpretations very bad and just didn't make sense.  the English subtitles just did not fit the actual scene and was very disappointed.  I believe this dvd was more suitable for Chinese/English language interpretations.",1381708800,,345,5.490566037735849
8434402,5,B004LHM95C,If you enjoy Japanese movies and/or food you will enjoy this movie. It is very entertaining; I particularly like how the men in the movie begin to appreciate the chefs cooking more and more.,1373760000,,190,4.617647058823529
8434403,4,B004LHM95C,"Eight Japanese men living in a research station near the South Pole. Some wanted to be here, some...not so much. Living together for more than a year with very limited outside contact, relationships between the men become, at times, strained; at times, volatile. Their relationships with their families and loved ones who they left behind are sometimes even more difficult. We experience the year through the cook assigned at the last minute to the station and see how much influence food can have in these men's lives, both in bringing them together and pushing them apart.",1323734400,,574,4.989583333333333
8434404,1,B004LHM95C,"This is a great movie.  However, this DVD has horrible English subtitles.  I've seen the movie before in a film festival, so I know that good subtitles exist.  The ones on this DVD made the movie un-watchable for non-Japanese speakers.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who does not speak Japanese.",1299974400,7,306,4.716981132075472
