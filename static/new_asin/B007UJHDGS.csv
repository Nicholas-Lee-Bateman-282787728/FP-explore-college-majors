In order to use it you must use in CD-ROM You cannot install it then remove the dist to use the program:
I am using version 1.00 from 2002 and it will work on windows 10. Open the disk on your computer click on Setup. EXE after you OK it from your computer popup click run from CD-ROM. It will not instal the only way to use it is with the disk. works for me.",1516233600,,493,3.843137254901961

8521956,5,B007UJHDGS,"I have owned this software for many years and received all the updates to go with it as it is no longer available as far as I know.  I have found it makes great labels for quilts and it can work well with using it for photos for scrap booking projects to print on paper.  When I need a quilt label to print on fabric, this is the software to use.  Highly recommend it.",1364342400,3,368,3.945945945945946
8521957,1,B007UJHDGS,"I have been quilting for a number of years and make labels for all my large quilts. I finally found this as a used item on Amazon and was thrilled to find it. However, I was very disappointed to find it was more about cards and stationery than quilt labels. I had a copy of the old HP Let's Celebrate (1998) that was much more useful for making quality quilt labels. Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with my new computer and Windows 7. It's too bad HP didn't take the label making section of the Let's Celebrate CD and publish that as a quilt label kit. It would have been much more useful in my opinion.",1350518400,8,606,4.278260869565218
