8614423,1,B00FCAK3N2,"Absolute garbage. Interviews ripped off of youtube and poorly trimmed together with a high school media class feel. No interesting facts about Mayer. Just: *interview that you can find everywhere* *Transition* ""Mayer's first non-indie album was Room for Squares"" *Next youtube interview* Horrible. Insulting",1509580800,,307,6.0
8614424,2,B00FCAK3N2,"This was the kind of DVD that you used to make from a DVD burner back in the early 2000's.  It's not a bad product, but it took us multiple attempts to find a device that would read the DVD.  We enjoyed the footage, to some it may not be exciting but because were big John Mayer fans we enjoyed it.",1492992000,,298,3.8688524590163933

8614427,2,B00FCAK3N2,Don't expect to see him jamming on his guitar or hear him sing its just a boring boring interview talk talk talk sitting down in a chair....No Music  .,1414022400,2,151,4.206896551724138
8614428,1,B00FCAK3N2,"The production quality of this item was not good. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the interviews look like they were taken straight from YouTube. I dislike knocking an attempt at producing something of value, but you can definitely do much better.",1393027200,3,249,5.097560975609756
8614429,1,B00FCAK3N2,It's kind of like a high school project. There isn't even john Mayer music in the background just some elevator music. Save your money and watch interviews on you tube.,1390953600,2,168,4.633333333333334
8614430,3,B00FCAK3N2,"To be completely honest this is basically a couple of interviews that you could find on YouTube thrown together.  The quality is sub par even for a DVD.  I have seen a few of these interviews on YouTube.  What disappoints me is that the quality looks like a 360 pixel video blown up on your TV, which looks average at best.  To say that this is  a ""production"" is a compliment.  It was made on a Mac in iMovie.  I can tell from the screen menu.

The information presented is good information, but as I stated before, it is nothing you could not find on the internet.

I was just excited about this as there is not much out there for Mayer in terms of books and DVD's so when I saw something like this I was excited.

I would say keep your $10.",1390867200,3,743,4.097222222222222
8614431,2,B00FCAK3N2,"Haven't made it all the way through one viewing yet.  Listening to Johns conversations are good to put you to sleep, unlike his music.  I love his music, despite his social and personal flubs.",1390780800,,192,4.617647058823529
