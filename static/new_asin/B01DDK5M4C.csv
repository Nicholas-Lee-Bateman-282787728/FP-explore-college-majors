8755593,5,B01DDK5M4C,"My daughter (3  1/2 yrs. old) loves Twini and Twinki.  She wants to watch this almost every day.  She learned so much spelling from this DVD and asks me all the time what is the ""spelling of ___"".  It is easy to like Twini and Twinki and every episode is short enough to get and hold her attention and all the words they spell has the object incorporated with it and maybe that is why my daughter remembers them.  I recommend this to my friend and bought the other DVD too.",1473379200,,473,4.153846153846154
8755594,5,B01DDK5M4C,"My 2.5 year old is just starting to vocalize words and is working on really pronouncing things correctly. While watching Twiki and Twini, she really enjoyed trying to say the words back and interact with the characters. The types of words were great for her language skills and allowed her to learn in a friendly environment without feeling frustrated at not being able to vocalize harder words. Each story gave her new words to focus on all while keeping her attention. Eventually, when older, we can use this DVD to help with spelling. Overall, it was great and Im sure we will watch it again and again.",1470787200,,605,4.663551401869159
8755595,5,B01DDK5M4C,"My kids and I were pleasantly surprised with this new release in the Kiwi collection. My boys ages 4, 8 and 9 all found it intriguing and hilarious! The phonics skill building was great for my little one, and the older boys got a kick out of the silly antics of the claymation birds named Twini and Twiki! I believe this show was initially released as a children's show in France. It has been translated into English in this release, but there are a couple lingering French touches you may still notice. For instance, the cookbook in the episode titled Strawberry Pie has the word marmiton (which means kitchen hand) on the front of it. My kids and I looked it up online to find the translation, and so this aspect of the show encouraged learning beyond a simple phonics lesson (causing us to delve into the study of other languages). The show uses colorful and creative complex designs for the letters used to spell the key words. There are typically around 4 words per episode that are introduced throughout the short clips, and then they are reviewed at the end of the clip with the birds doing silly dances alongside. Some of the featured words are a bit lengthier than others. For instance, FAN in comparison to STRAWBERRY; however, they are all appropriate for word recognition purposes with the younger kids. All these mini episodes have different scenarios that incorporate problem-solving and interpersonal skills. All in all, each of us thoroughly enjoyed viewing this clever new show. As a side note, it is ironic how the bird characters display similar characteristics to those of Redbird and Chuck from the popular Angry Birds series. My kids really appreciated that aspect of the show, as they are big fans of all things bird at the moment!

The DVD holds 20 fun phonics stories with a running time of approximately 105 minutes. The stories included are Strawberry Pie, Housecleaning, Twiki's Movie, The Exhibition, Gardening, The Snowman, Kiwi's House, The Magic Compass, Twiki & Twini go to School, The Little Robot, The Witch's Hat, The Alien, The Puppet, The Blue Butterfly, The Incredible Discovery, The Funny Picnic, The Terrible Yeti, The Helicopter, The Super Snack and King Twiki.

Kiwi: 20 Phonics Adventures is a fun, educational, colorful and well-animated series on DVD that does a good job of teaching young children about phonics and wordbuilding.

Kids can learn phonics along with Kiwi birds, Twiki and Twini, as they go on adventures including making a movie and trying to find a magic compass. My favorite episode in this volume, the latest in the Kiwi series, is The Little Robot. Twiki and Twini meet a blue robot in desperate need of energy and they have to go to the moon to find moon rocks to power him.

Another episode I enjoyed is The Magic Compass. The Kiwis find a magic compass that can change the seasons but a mischievous skunk steals it and Twiki and Twini need to find it so they can change the season back.

Each short episode of Kiwi: 20 Phonics Adventures teaches a few words revolving around a specific topic. For instance, one episode centers on housecleaning and another on art. The narrators spell and sound out the words used in each episode and review all of them at the end. Every episode is very playful and bright and the words stay in your mind because they use shapes and objects from the episodes theme to spell out the words on your screen and make it more memorable.

The claymation is very lush and colorful and stands out in this quirky series. The animation brings the kiwi birds to life and, even though they never talk, you understand their personalities and relationship. I really like watching the two buddies, the short, round and sometimes grumpy Twiki and his tall cheery yellow sidekick, the clumsy, easygoing Twini. Fun side characters throughout the series keep the stories lively.

Kiwi: 20 Phonics Adventures was originally a French series and its fun to spot clues from European culture in the animation in some of the episodes. For example, when showing you how to spell coin, they use European money to make the letter o.

Kids will have a great time learning about phonics with Twiki and Twini.
I give Kiwi: 20 Phonics Adventures an age rating of 3 to 6 or for anyone trying to learn to read and rate it 4 out of 5 stars.
