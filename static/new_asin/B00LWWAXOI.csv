6508966,3,B00LWWAXOI,"After celebrating its 50th Anniversary last year, Doctor Who has returned for an eight season (series) with Peter Capaldi taking over the title reigns from Matt Smith. The eight season (series) premiered on August 23rd on BBC One and BBC America with the 80-minute episode, titled Deep Breath. Typically a DW fan would have to wait until the full season (series) DVD or Blu-ray release to own the first episode, but BBC America will be releasing Doctor Who: Deep Breath on a single-disc DVD and Blu-ray today, September 9, 2014. Bonus Features include: a Prequel Scene, Behind the Scenes, Doctor Who Lives: The Next Doctor and The Real History of Science Fiction: Episode 4 - Time.

Deep Breath picks up shortly after the ending of The Time of the Doctor with newly regenerated Doctor suffering from a bit of post-regenerative trauma. The adventure beings with the TARDIS being spit out of the mouth of a Tyrannosaurus Rex that is causing chaos in Victorian London. The Doctor's latest companion, Clara Oswald (played by Jenna Coleman), is still in shock about the Doctor's new incarnation and seeks help from the Paternoster Gang - Silurian Madame Vastra (played by Neve McIntosh), her human maid/wife Jenny Flint (played by Catrin Stewart), and the Sontaran butler Strax (played by Dan Starkey).

While the Doctor tries to rest, the Paternoster Gang helps the local police deal with the Tyrannosaurus Rex problem.  Out of nowhere the Tyrannosaurus Rex spontaneously combusted into thin air.

The Doctor, along with Clara and the Paternoster Gang, investigates the strange occurrences, which leads them on the trail of human-like robots that is lead by a cyborg who wants to become human.

When I first heard that a dinosaur would appear in Deep Breath, I thought it would be as campy as the episode Dinosaurs on a Spaceship from season (series) seven, but surprisingly, the CGI effects were pretty decent. Plus, the dinosaur only made a brief appearance and it has very little to do with the plot. I was somewhat skeptical about the casting of Peter Capaldi, as he is the oldest actor to the play the part since William Hartnell, but after watching the Deep Breath, I'm now impressed by his acting abilities. He gives the Doctor multiple layers, something that has been missing from the character.

While visually the episode looks amazing, the plot is slightly misguided and boring at times. How many times does the Doctor have to battle a cyborg? Once again, the show-runner and executive producer Steven Moffat pens the script, but it seem he just keeps reusing the same themes from previous episodes, adding absolutely nothing to the story. The only thing that keeps the episode moving along is Peter Capaldi's take on the Doctor. The rest of the cast also does a wonderful job, though Jenna Coleman seemed to be slightly out of character. In the episode The Name of the Doctor, she traveled through time and met each incarnation of the Doctor, so I was shocked by her mixed emotions towards his new regeneration. Overall, Doctor Who: Deep Breath is an overly long episode with a cliched plot, though the episode is saved from being a complete disaster by Peter Capaldi's exceptional performance as the 12th Doctor. The DVD also features the six-minute prequel scene and the behind-the-scene featurette that was only seen in theaters, as well as the original ""live"" Peter Capaldi's casting announcement and the documentary focusing on the history of time travel in science fiction.

6508967,3,B00LWWAXOI,"Disappointment... disappointment mostly with the new doctor. Capaldi is a well established actor. He currently is playing an excellent Richelieu but, to me so far, a terrible Doctor Who, second only to William Hartnell. An older doctor is OK (I'm older than him) but you need the soul of the character. I don't see it with Capaldi. If you wanted old, give it back to Tom Baker. Since all the regenerations have been used up and this starts a new countdown, the writers could have come up with some reason to revive #4.

Bottom line, I believe it was a bad call.

Another gripe is the new opening. I prefer most all of the older ones, especially the music, which has gone downhill since November 23, 1963.

TARDIS interior stinks. Looks like the inside of a 1970's dance club.

Carla seems a bit less than she was. Bad writing or is it just me?

Yes, the writing.  Not bad, not so good.

I own every episode available (as far as I know). 'Deep Breath' is better than many of the 'classic' ones but falls short of most of the modern ones. T-Rex opening was big but quickly turned to a vehicle for the doctor to become introspective. Poor dinosaur.

Regeneration gets a C-. I prefer seeing the transition and waking up process in one episode.

Bottom line on 'Deep Breath', it did It's job in kicking off the new Doctor and giving us new characters.

My hat is off to reviewer Allan M. Lees who pointed out that death has become a resting point in recent outings - shown here when a bad guy is impaled to death but awakens in 'paradise'.  In episode 2, it happens again.

Please write your Congressman or Member of Parliament and demand an impeachment of Capaldi.",1409443200,,1660,4.460264900662252
6508968,5,B00LWWAXOI,Finally a classic Doctor that I can love again.  I thought Peter was wonderful and I can't wait for the rest of the series.  He is perfect in the role and I enjoyed the first episode immensity.,1409270400,11,193,4.1891891891891895
6508969,3,B00LWWAXOI,"I have to admit, I was surprised to see this as a single dvd when we all know it will be available as a season in a few months. As the episode went, it was full of some surprises and a lot of the same ole same ole. No doubt Peter very quickly let us know he was making this role his own. But, there was a lot that made this doctor less likeable than the other doctors. *** Spoiler Alert*** The main thing for me was when he abandoned Clara to the robots who use human parts to keep themselves going. As she asked for the sonic screwdriver he says ""No I need it!""  This is not the doctor we all know and love. I  have been a fan for over 30 years all the way back to Hartnell, and I can tell you that no doctor abandons their companion. When this happened my wife who likes Dr. Who somewhat, gave up, pulled the covers over her head and said ""he's an idiot, I'm going to sleep."" I stuck it out, and found many redeeming qualities in this doctor. There was a great scene with him riding a horse to try to save the dinosaur. There was the nonsense though, where he tells Clara he speaks dinosaur. It reminded me of one of Matt's less believable moments when he said he spoke baby talk. The writers tend to leave a lot of the science out of the stories these days, and this leaves fans like me cold.  On the other hand, the whole mystery of the spontaneous combustion was a perfect Dr. Who fit. And the link back to ""The Girl in The Fireplace"" was a wonderful way to bring the first doctor into the series. The appearance and Straxx and friends was a welcome distraction. Straxx as always was hilarious. Lastly, Matt's cameo while very welcome,  made me just long for the days when he was the doctor, wishing he would have remained.  Then again, I hated Matt when he first started, but he grew on me, maybe Peter will too. That is not to say I did not like him, I did, I just feel he could have been better or at least the story could have been. ***Spoiler Alert Over****

The next episode has Peter facing off against the Daleks, I don't know about you, but I love theh Daleks. However, they are getting old. The writers need to find new enemy's for the doctor, inject new blood into the series. They certainly have with a new doctor. Why not with new enemies, new stories and new adventures. By the way, can anyone tell me if Peter is the 12th or the 13th doctor? I mean doesn't the War Doctor count as one of his lives/regenerations? And, if so, then how are they going to pull off another doctor when Peter leaves?

Don't waste your money on this single episode, it will be available first as a half season, then later as a full season. Wait for the full season get your money's worth.

6508970,3,B00LWWAXOI,"I found this the most disappointing introduction of a new Doctor ever.  The show was lackluster, with far too much time spent on Paternoster Gang antics, and PLEASE get rid of the oh-so-perky Jenna Coleman.  The Doctor never really ""announced"" himself, as have every Doctor since Hartnell.  There were some nice moments, like Capaldi's speech as he sleeps.  But there was little of this.  Having a dinosaur in the first scene shows Moffat pitching the show now to kiddies.  Word has it that he plans to leave....he should do so NOW",1409011200,6,531,4.78021978021978
6508971,2,B00LWWAXOI,"Under the aegis of Russell T Davis, the original showrunner and lead writer for the rebooted Doctor Who, current showrunner and lead writer Stephen Moffat turned in some good stories. When he took over from RTD, his transition episode introducing the Matt Smith Doctor was outstanding. But since then, Moffat has become increasingly self-indulgent in his writing. He's also seemingly unable to edit his neurotic need to kill off characters and then bring them back five minutes later, as though death was equivalent to popping out to the corner shop for a pint of milk and some chocolate biscuits.

This new series, with the excellent Peter Capaldi assuming the role of The Doctor, seemed to offer the chance of regenerating the series after a very lame final series featuring the Matt Smith Doctor. Alas, the chance was lost. All the old boring tropes are here: the unnecessary dinosaur, the lack of emotional depth, the can't-decide-if-we're-comic-or-serious schizophrenia, and yes, you guessed it, the killing off of a character only to bring him back to life a couple of scenes later. Talk about self-parody. In case you should feel I'm being hard on Moffat, I should explain that I watched this episode in a movie theater where several hundred people had gathered to watch the special screening. When the master cyborg was seen impaled upon a spire, one member of the audience muttered ""don't worry, it's a Moffat script, he'll be back in five minutes."" And sure enough, he was - causing several audience members to groan audibly.

The problem is Doctor Who is a show that has, in the past, been able to transcend the open-mouthed gawk-at-a-meaningless-spectacle much that makes up too much sci-fi. It has had great actors and capable scripts. Under Moffat, Doctor Who has become a romp, a stand-up comedy sketch in which pathos is quickly brushed aside with an explosion or a gag. The writing is lazy, repetitive, and ultimately demeans the show and the audience. It's long past time for Moffat to be replaced and until that happens, this iconic series isn't worth your time.",1408924800,18,2081,4.959885386819484
6508972,5,B00LWWAXOI,"Deep Breath. AND WHAT A RIDE!!! Finally, back to the ""classic Dr"" and not the ""boyfriend"" Dr. More concentration on characters and science and the new Dr trying to figure out ""who"" he will be as he grows. I love Peter in the roll--Pertwee and Baker--with a Scottish accent. Also love that accent. Like all the Dr's before, the regeneration tosses the Dr.'s personality and memory around--the clockwork people--he couldn't remember--but I did--The Girl in the Fireplace is the episode the Dr. first met them. The ""lady""--no, I do not believe she is River--in fact--I have a feeling a new enemy has just been introduced--one the Dr. ""loves to --well not love. Straxx and company are back for this episode and they are welcomed--Straxx was a hoot. This Dr is not going to be one of the ""fun ones"". He will be deeper and darker and I'd guess--not so nice or fun to travel with sometimes. Yup, Peter is going to be just great in this roll. And I welcome him.

bit of an update: Just watched the episode for a second time--When he gets up from the chair in the TARDIS and comes down the stairs--there is no question-he is the Dr. And ya, the lady at the close is evil--it will be fun to see just what she is planning for the Dr.",1408838400,18,1222,4.431111111111111
6508973,5,B00LWWAXOI,"Free of any spoilers, I will say that this was a well written and rigid first episode for the Twelfth Doctor. Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman seem to complement each other quite well while encountering their first dilemma. Both Doctor and Companion do show some vulnerabilities that give them the kind of character depth the series pulls off charmingly well, especially towards the last moments of Deep Breath. This is, from a wider view, an appetizer for greater things to come, so you may find that it dwells a little too much on establishing an origin for the new Doctor instead of having him do more stuff. But then again, what did you expect from the first episode? In addition, it does follow the continuity of the more recent episodes from the previous iteration, so for avid viewers this won't feel like it's being catered to newcomers to the show. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at the others that show up here...

As for this standalone physical copy, I'm not sure if you should be shelling out so much for a single episode of Doctor Who. After all, there are 11 more to go in this series, and the entire set of those episodes will be available in November. It may be an extended episode (at around 70 minutes), but I doubt you'll receive a better value buying this than simply getting the upcoming box set. There's also Amazon Instant Video to check out, where the current price of this episode is $8 in HD (but from what I've heard, don't buy the season pass just yet). However, my argument may be invalid given the majority of Doctor Who fans that are determined to collect whatever they can of this awesome show. Deep Breath continues the show's charm and Sci-Fi zaniness, so if you're one of those type of fans, buy this now!",1408838400,34,1745,4.557324840764331
6508974,4,B00LWWAXOI,"I was genuinely surprised at how much I liked Deep Breath.

Peter Capaldi was brilliant throughout. For me, the most impressive moment was when the Doctor was interpreting dinosaur and Capaldi really was bringing the T-Rex's thoughts and feelings to life. There are so many great moments, and the script does a great job of conveying the confusion of this Doctor as to who he is and what's going on. This sort of idea was what Anthony Steven tried to portray when the Sixth Doctor had his breakdown in the Twin Dilemma, but couldn't really communicate in the mess. The idea of feeling this confused and also pained by the fact that Clara doesn't recognize him as him.

Clara does become a bit better established in this story and Jenna Coleman turns in some great moments. The script goofed with the idea that the Impossible Girl who journeyed through the Doctor's timelines and saw all of his faces would think she could ""change him back."" However, beyond that this story does a good job showing her very real reactions and she has some very moving moments.

And then there was Matt Smith's cameo which was absolutely beautiful.

The story itself is good, engaging, and makes for a chilling, and creepy tale. It's a bit of a departure for new Who as each of the prior three Doctors first tale has involved an alien invasion of Earth as their first story. This was a nice change of pace actually.

What I didn't like about it was the pacing. While Time of the Doctor tried to condense too much story into an hour, this didn't really have enough quality story for a whole 80 minutes and the story really dragged at the beginning. The big problem for this was the the Paternoster Gang.

What were they even doing here? Had they been replaced by some random people who offered assistance, the story would have been far shorter. As it was, they dragged the plot line out with Vastra's absurd behavior toward Clara, and even Strax's humor came off as weak. I also found the cop out over what happened to the Half Face Man to be very irritating.

Overall, despite being overlong due to unnecessary elements, this is a solid beginning for the Twelfth Doctor.",1431129600,,2151,4.600522193211488

6508978,4,B00LWWAXOI,"The first adventure for Peter Capaldi as the Doctor, ""Deep Breath"" is the establishing story for the Twelfth Doctor and his tenure. This disc only has that first story for his first year, but as far as bonus features go, it includes a prequel scene that was included with the theatrical release, as well as a behind the scenes short, a recording of the live program that revealed Capaldi's casting as the Doctor, and a documentary, ""The Real History of Science Fiction: Time"". Aside from the behind-the-scenes short, none of these were included in the Series Eight box set.

The best thing about Doctor who is that it is family friendly. Everyone can enjoy it without the fear of curse words. I really loved this season opener. it is a good 90 minuets. the longest season opener ever shown. I only wished it was longer! Personally, i don't understand how people can give ""Time of the Doctor"" or the other two episodes that proceed it rave reviews and give this one so many negative reviews. Series eight is more in tune with the spirit of the original series of Doctor Who than any other series before it. My only complaint is this, they need to get rid of the ""Posner Gang"" They belong in the setting of the Addams Family or Red Dwarf. They don't belong in Doctor Who at all, but Peter Capaldi and Jenna Louise Coleman are so amazing, i can overlook them.

I was totally wrong.  Clara is all messed up over her new found love and sometimes acts like an idiot and the Doctor seems to be very aloof and cold, but you quickly see through that fake exterior and Peter Capaldi does a fabulous job in aloofly caring for Clara and humanity as well as successfully following the likes of Tenant and Smith that I did not think could be accomplished.  If his next season is as good as the 8th, I hope that he wants to stay around for many seasons.
