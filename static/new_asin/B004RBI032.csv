8438915,5,B004RBI032,"I have searched high and low for the Ghost Goes West, is a British romantic comedy/fantasy film starring Robert Donat, Jean Parker, and Eugene Pallette and is a movie I remember from when I was very little.
But you probably have to be from or into what I consider the golden era of films (Marx Brothers/Mae West/Errol Flynn) to have seen or remember this little gem.
The daughter of a rich American businessman (Eugene Pallette), persuades him to purchase a Scottish castle from Donald Glourie (Robert Donat), dismantle it and move it to Florida. Along with the castle goes its ghost.
Murdoch Glourie (also played by Donat) haunts the castle after dying a cowards death in the 18th century blown up while wooing instead of fighting. To find rest, he must get a descendant of the enemy Clan MacClaggan to admit that one Glourie is worth fifty MacClaggans.
It is a light hearted romantic comedy with some sad moments, the ghost/Glourie is dashing and handsome in the way of Errol Flynn..it was voted the Best British film in 1936.
It will be a movie I will pass down to my grandkids.

The Ghosts of Berkeley Square a 1947 British comedy film, directed by Vernon Sewell and starring Robert Morley and Felix Aylmer. The film is an adaptation of the novel No Nightingales , A movie I had never seen..silly, campy in the Monty Python style quite a few shake your head and snicker-out-loud moments.",1405382400,,1415,4.705645161290323

8438918,5,B004RBI032,"I love Robert Donat and his work.  No argument there.  However, I have one question ( or did I miss something ).  Evidently the 18th century character (Murdoch) was married, or one of the ""forfeits"" of his riddle resulted in at least one pregnancy.  Otherwise, where did his descendant (Donald) come from?  Would really like to know the answer to this one. Anyone with an explanation?  Carol Bauer",1402963200,,397,4.764705882352941

We found The Ghosts of Berkeley Square to be slightly more entertaining than The Ghost Goes West, but both are great.  If you are a collector of old movies, particularly ghost stories, then these are for you.  They are very funny and entertaining.  We found ourselves feeling sorry for the ghosts of Berkeley Square.  We have watched these several times and still find them entertaining.",1339804800,8,516,4.741573033707865
