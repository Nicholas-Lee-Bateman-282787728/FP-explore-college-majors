8626098,2,B00GPL0J2M,"The location, editing, lighting, and knowledge of Silat was excellent. I did not like the audio dubbing over the instructor voice it was hard to understand what the the instructor was saying and I was just distracted by listening to two voices at the same time.  In the future I would like to have sub titles only no audio dubbing at all. Please make the sub titles are big enough to read. I do not look forward to purchasing other Silat dvd's unless they have sub titles only.",1496880000,,477,4.420454545454546

8626101,4,B00GPL0J2M,"This dvd shows stretching,and breathing exercises as well as some form and applications from Harimau (tiger) style pentjack  silat. I bought it specifically because i wanted more in depth instruction in Indonesian systems of Breath control and chi-gung..
Which many of the masters are loathe to teach those not in their inner circle.
So..for my purposes I feel the presenter did a good job of instructing a simpler yet effective version of breath control and pranayama-chi gung. He then demonstrates his ability to withstand hard blows to vulnerable areas of his body with no ill effects.

If you are looking for a lot of Harimau forms and applications this DVD is not for you. I
Breath control and stretching are the main focus with some forms and applications.",1392940800,7,762,4.9453125
