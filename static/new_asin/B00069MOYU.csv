8040655,1,B00069MOYU,"First off, i love the scribble jam videos themselves. that being said, i feel that the description of this dvd is a bit mis-leading. it does state that it has the best of battles from several years, what it doesnt tell you is that the sound quality is horrible, and the majority of it looks very amateur in filming as well. none of the battles follow any logical order, and most of them don't even show the conclusion, such as who won.

its really too bad, a lot of the MCs that i listen to are on this DVD, but theres nothing on this DVD that you cant see or even download on a video site.

as far as the quality of the item i actually received from Amazon...very poor. the wrapper inside the plastic cover, is severely wrinkled.

what i would recommend is just watching the battles you enjoy on a site that hosts videos, and save your money. this dvd isn't worth the money.",1233878400,3,875,4.259036144578313
