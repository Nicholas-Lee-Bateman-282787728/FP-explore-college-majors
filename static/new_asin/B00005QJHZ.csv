7950679,5,B00005QJHZ,"When I was little I watched a VHS copy of the Little Brown Burro over and over again.  My poor parents.  Now I'm excited to find it so I can let my children torture me the same way!
All kidding aside though the music is catchy and the main story, the tale of the little brown burro everyone was mean to is fun.  Of course there is a moral and the poor burro whose only friend was a singing rat ends up being the burro that carries Mary to the stable where she gives birth.  That is a small part though of such a bigger fun story.  Its sort of a Christmas Tale of the Ugly Duckling.",1356480000,,581,3.9316239316239314
