7880932,1,6305020671,"I ordered this product/DVD, and it said that it was in English, Czech, and Mandarin, but it is not, just in Chinese. I have to get English or at least English dub, as my eyes are bad and cannot see to read as fast as the dialog is going. I love the Asian cinema, but simply cannot do sub titles any longer. I don't know if this is Amazons fault or a sellers, but I am not happy.......at all!",1397260800,,391,3.962025316455696
7880933,2,6305020671,"Ok, I've seen it despite the poor reviews. I can't say I wasn't told. The only reason this gets two stars is it was a really bad train wreak of a movie as one five star review, on another site, said. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS.",1188172800,,232,3.9574468085106385
7880934,5,6305020671,"I saw this in the theatre in 1997 and thought it ruled.  Andy Lau was brill as the scientist, Anthony Wong is always fantastic, and it was a great supernatural thriller, which is a genre you don't see so much of in HK films.  I really enjoyed it completely and I have no idea why anyone else dislikes it--perhaps it's just not what they expect from an HK film?  But if you like things like Twin Peaks, Supernatural, Profit, Hex, Existenz, or The Matrix I think you will enjoy this movie!",1181952000,,487,4.329670329670329
7880935,2,6305020671,"Terrible ending to this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller.  Andy Lau (in his umpteenth lead role) plays a scientist and head of a telecommunications MNC whose girlfriend (Michelle Reis) has just died, and then gets involved in an international cult that believes the end of the world is nigh.  With a cop friend (Anthony Wong) he got tracked down by the Caucasian cult leader who wants to ordain him (?).  At the end the director and writers probably run out of ideas, or funds, or both.  Whatever good the film does in the first one hour is undone by the abysmal end.  You'll be a saint not to throw things at your television set.  Pretty boy Andy gets to decide the fate of the world?  Gimme a break!  Is this the end of the world or what?",1105228800,,735,4.392592592592592
7880936,1,6305020671,"This is a supernatural ""thriller"" about a mysterious cult that is murdering famous scientists (why?) by spontanteous combustion. Our hero, played by the talented Andy Lau, is a scientist on the list who has police protection forced on him, but will only accept his old friend the cop, played well by the accomplished Anthony Wong, as a bodyguard. Things get weird as Andy's dead fiancee starts appearing to him and everyone else and soon it becomes clear as the cult invites him into their inner sanctum, that God is pissed and everything falls to Andy making a decision.
Despite competent direction and good acting all around, this just drags on, makes no sense in many places, and has a ridiculous sappy ending that will make just about anyone cringe. The few positive moments are all in snappy banter between the two friends and virtually no action exists here. Unless you can't resist the re-united beyond the grave love story thing, avoid this one.",1077494400,,953,4.852760736196319
7880937,2,6305020671,"Andy Lau is the scientist.  Anthony Wong is his buddy, the cop assigned to protect him when leading scientists start getting knocked off in some unusual ways.  Oh, and there's a dead wife coming back here and there to  torment Andy. Actually, this film held my attention for about the first 45  minutes.  It seems to be headed in some neat, techno occult direction, but  . . . well, this one falls apart and it's not pretty. One last question: how  come all the worst Caucasian actors are in Hong Kong?  I think some L.A.  waiters should buy a plane ticket and try their luck.",957916800,2,576,4.40952380952381
