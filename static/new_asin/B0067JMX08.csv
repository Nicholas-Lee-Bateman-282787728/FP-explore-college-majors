""Westworld's"" premise and the sets are fantastic, and the suspense just builds throughout the entire movie. Who is real? Who's a robot? Can humans triumph and take back control, or will technology triumph and override its creators?

The film is dated now due to its HBO-sponsored sequel, but it still holds its own as a cult classic. I watched it again before the new series started, and it's still as creepy and suspenseful as it was forty years ago.  The only ""theme park nightmare"" that could possibly top it is a movie version of Larry Niven's ""Dream Park."" (Hint, hint, Hollywood) .  The original ""Westworld"" is as thrilling today as it was forty years ago, and has aged well. Check it out.",1476835200,,865,4.6644736842105265
