5878739,5,B00DYC6I16,"love it, its quick and easy and the results are amazing. I would recommend to all.  If you don't have time this is the perfect ab workout",1399248000,2,137,4.074074074074074
5878740,5,B00DYC6I16,"This ""vintage"" Firm workout is one of the best ever.  I am 59 years old and have been doing this workout somewhat regularly for over 20 years.  What is great about it is you can start out with no weights and then gradually increase the size of your weights as you work your way up to the most effective level for you.  The movements and instructors are very easy to understand and follow--no complicated, fancy footwork to learn.  I have not found any better workout videos than the early Firm series.  This  includes the Susan Harris video, the Janet Jones video, the LaRenne Chabut video and the compilation video called Firm Parts/5 Day Abs.  These workouts are like the fountain of youth.  They keep you strong and flexible, and are great for your overall sense of well-being.  I love the style of the videos because, with the exception of the compilation video, they are neatly divided in half.  The first half is standing, the second half is floor.  I do half of each video every day and rotate my way through the series.  I also add a 20-30 minute walk or stationary bike ride to the workout.  All in all it's about one hour of my time every day, an investment that continues to pay off.  The nice thing is, I don't have to leave home, I can roll out of bed, have my coffee, and get right to it before I start the rest of my day.  A nice starter weight set would be a pair each of 3, 5, and 7 or 8 pound dumbbells.  For the LaRenne Chabut and compilation workouts you will also need a step.  This can be any kind of step that is solid and sturdy--I got mine used for very little money.  Don't feel bad if you can't do it all the first 10 times through.  Do your best and it WILL pay off!  You will feel so much better and you will see results and find muscles you never even knew you had.  Highly recommend this early Firm series (except the third one, lady in orange leotard, is user unfriendly IMHO).  I noticed another reviewer said she thought the moves were jerky and dangerous in these early videos.  I disagree.  They CAN be dangerous if you use weights that are too heavy for you to handle smoothly, but there is a disclaimer that states as much at the beginning of the video.  Start SLOWLY until you build your strength--I believe that is a direct quote from one of the instructors.  Check around on Amazon for the DVD version of these early tapes.  I just ordered the Janet Jones DVD.",1396137600,11,2401,4.313199105145414
5878741,3,B00DYC6I16,"It is a good workout.  However, this video is a collage of videos; instead of one consistent workout. Not like the original Tough tape at all.",1392076800,,142,4.461538461538462

8599111,2,B00DYC6I16,"This is for the tough tape 2. I have yet to try the 5-day abs.  I've tried to do tough tape 2 many times, and I just don't like the style.  It's a firm parts video so it switches to different segments from different videos all throughout. This has weight lifting mixed with some cardio and stretching in between and at the end.  It uses a step and dumbells and a dowel rod.  The video is just too choppy for me to follow,  working one side of the body and doing something else and coming back to the other side about 5 minutes later, and I forget what side I worked the last time!  While it's not really a bad workout I feel they have better and I wasn't really sweaty at the end using my normal weight for those moves. I own 10 classic firm workouts and this is probably my least favorite. The original tough tape is so much better and is probably my favorite firm workout.  If you can find Tough Tape 1, which I think is really hard to find though, I would get that one if you wanted this set for tough tape 2.",1526947200,,1012,4.055276381909548
