5243181,4,B00925TBSG,One of Verdi's rarely performed operas gets a respectable performance on this DVD. The cast aquits themselves well and handles the difficult music competently. It's fortunate just to have this opera available and well performedon DVD/,1368576000,,234,5.527777777777778
5243182,5,B00925TBSG,"Since Mr Gleeson wrote such an elaborate appreciation of this DVD, and I thoroughly agree with it, so I try to be brief.
This video has been prepared along with 25 more, the complete operatic ouvre of Verdi, to celebrate his 200th year of birth, this year Oct 11th. All these DVD's are by Italians, on Italian stages with mostly Italian singers, conductors, stage directors. According to critics: ""this is how Verdi should be played"" and so far of what I've heard and seen I fully agree. The provincial opera house of the city of Parma was chosen simply because Verdi was born in Le Rancole, a little village in the province of Parma in Lombardy. Verdi was a peasant boy, from the lowest of origins, but an immense talent and became the main dominant figure of Italian opera in the latter half of the 19th century. In fact not only Italian opera, but I daresay all opera, except Richard Wagner, but that's another story.
Now.... I Lombardi. We mustn't forget that it was a young Verdi's fourth opera for La Scala, but over the years it was overshadowed by Nabucco and very much underappreciated. Not that it wasn't a great success in its time, actually it even outdid Nabucco. Verdi's inexpererience with librettists is obvious. The libretto is overlong,awkward and confusing and trying to cover a lot of ground. But the music!  If anybody has any doubts, I recommend to turn off the picture and just listen to the score and I guarantee that all doubts will vanish (provided the listener not being tone-deaf or lacking musical sensitivity.)
Calling it a choral opera is ridiculous. Although it has some of the most beautiful, inspired choruses Verdi ever wrote (eg. Gerusalemme, Gerusalemme!) but it also full of great arias, duets and ensembles, especially the latter where Verdi's lion teeth is beginning to emerge. Just listen to the Trio at the end of the 3rd act that is absolute heaven and it gives me the shivers no matter how many times I've heard it.
As for the performance: Daniele Callegari, the conductor proudly steps into the shoes of the late Lamberto Gardelli who first revived the work in the 1970's. An energetic, totally under control leadership. Singers have already been written about by my colleague, all excellent. To all lovers of opera and great music I can only advise: ""buy it without hesitation!""",1357430400,8,2324,4.781094527363184
5243183,3,B00925TBSG,"A great choral opera, as one would expect from Verdi, and a great choral
performance.  Keeping track of what is going on is another matter and this
performance does little to help in that direction, in spite of the subtitles.  I've
learned over the years that different performances of the same opera can
leave one with widely different impressions, or very little impression at all,
of the work and its interpretation.  I think we have to keep looking for a
definitive version of this work.",1355097600,6,491,4.752941176470588
5243184,5,B00925TBSG,"In his excellent book, ""Verdi With A Vengeance"", William Berger noted this about I Lombardi: ""Judging by the score alone, much of the work appears primitive to the point of absurdity, but in an emotionaly committed performance, I Lombardi can come alive"". And that, gentle reader, is exactly what happened in January of 2009, when this performance took place. Not all at once, mind, but once Maestro Callegari started the Music, it was clear that one thing this performance would be was energetic.

The first scene was a bit uneven, due in large part to the use of a computer or camera to project the scenery on the back wall of the stage. When singers came between the projector and the backdrop in closeup, one could see the projection on the singer's face and costume. And then there was Michele Pertusi's makeup and beard; I flashed back to Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless. It was pure amateurism, but only mildly distractiong. And only in the first scene with respect to the beard; the projected scenery continued on and off through the balance of the opera.

But, man! did Pertusi sing!! and act! His was a deep, rich, fully realized interpretation of Pagano, who kills his father by mistake while trying to do in his brother, then becomes a hermit in the Holy Land by way of atonement, and THEN leads the cusaders to capture Jerusalem. All in a day's work back then, I guess. Bravo!

Dimitra Theodossiu fully realized the character of Giselda, although with a bit of start up roughness and an occasional touch of vocal roughness just below the ""break"" (passagio). There were a lot of absolutely stunning pianissimi, as well and full dramatic commitment. Brava!

I Lombardi has two, (count 'em ...2!) tenor parts, and both were first rate. As Oronte, Francesco Meli was as good as it gets. From bottom to top, he was the real deal, and his acting was totally in keeping with the rest of the cast. As Arvino, Pagano's brother as well as Giselda's father, Roberto DiBiasio was excellent. His part has no aria, but he was vocally secure and dramatically fully committed.

There are a couple of cautionary notes: first, this is early Verdi (his fourth opera) so the viewer should not expect Aida, although there are tons of beautiful music, much of it the high energy kind. Second, this is regional Italian opera, specifically, the Teatro Regio di Parma. One will not find the elaborate sets and costumes one experiences from the Met or Covent Garden, nor will one find the beauty pagent good looks often experienced in the divas who sing there. What the viewer does get (in spades!!) is the totally committed and loving performances of Italian opera by people who know and love it, and that from the pit and the chorus, as well as the soloists, and very limited interference from unqualified stage directors who ought to leave opera to those who know it and care about it.

DVD quality is superb both as to the picture and the DTS sound quality. There are subtitles (E, G, Fr, It, Sp, Ch, K, J) and a 10 minute ""making of"" extra. Opera time is 144 minutes.

Gentle reader, this is first rate work on early Verdi, and one can only hope that the rest of the ""Tutto Verdi"" series maintains the performance quality.",1351987200,23,3222,4.671957671957672
8534616,5,B00925TBSG,"The best overall performance of I Lombardi I have heard (whether on video or CD or live on stage). Not star-studded but a thoroughly satisfying provincial Italian performance: a mostly traditional production, with exciting conducting, chorus, and principals. Pertusi is fine as Pagano (though no Raimondi or Ramey), Meli acceptable as Oronte (though not one the ten best), Theodossiou the most exciting Giselda I have heard. The available competition on DVD is the more spectacular and more starry La Scala version with Carroli (miscast, baritonal, strained Pagano), Carreras (the best in the cast as a forceful Oronte)), and Dimitrova (my favorite Abigaille and Turandot but miscast as an ungainly Giselda).",1519344000,,708,5.445454545454545
8534617,5,B00925TBSG,"An excellent production.  If like me you are not familiar with this opera, the ten minutes of bonus material will be most helpful.  It introduces the characters and outlines the plot simply and clearly.  Also gives a little history of Nabucco (Verdi's third opera) and Lombardi (Verdi's fourth).  HD picture and sound are excellent.  I'm glad I did not spend the extra money for Bluray.  ~ Celeste Downey",1476921600,,404,4.867647058823529
8534618,2,B00925TBSG,"Although it was a traditional production, it was amateurish. The singing and performance were average. The makeup looked ridiculous. Also, the presentation was ""disjointed and bouncing"" as one reviewer already commented.",1470182400,,220,6.129032258064516
8534619,5,B00925TBSG,"Absolutely wonderful production.  Pertusi, Theodossiou and Meli gave great performances.  The music is beautiful.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1465344000,2,143,6.421052631578948
8534620,5,B00925TBSG,"I have spent two successive evenings watching two different performances of I Lombardi on dvd.  The first one I had had in my collection for years and had somehow neglected to watch, that of La Scala of thirty years ago, starring Carreras and Dimitrova.  I had also purchased recently after reading much praise, the Parma production.  Surprisingly, or perhaps not, I found the more recent production the better of the two.  Both productions are traditional and very well done.  One would assume that La Scala would run rings around more provincial attempts, but in almost all departments the Parma deserves at least equal praise.  The lower voices roles are sung well generally in both; but I thought that Carreras was not in best of voice, perhaps his ensuing illness was starting to manifest itself; and Dimitrova was having decidedly a mixed night: at times she would sing pianissimo ravishingly (which Theodossiou also does), and then seem to run out of gas for the higher tessitura, sounding flat and tired and by the end of the opera one feels she was hanging on by the skin of her teeth, er, vocal cords.  Anyway, Theodossiou sings wonderfully, does not run out of gas and as stated has some beautiful pianissimo moments.  Now, Mr. Meli, a name new to me, and I hope soon will be known by all opera lovers, definitely has the GOODS:  Great tone production, unforced, ""ring"" and total natural acting.  One hopes, are we witnessing a new career of the likes of Pavarotti or Domingo being born?  Gosh, I sure hope so.  One production misstep in the Parma that one can overlook : in the third act, the Christian Crusaders are singing in chorus before the walls of Jerusalem ; behind them the director has a lineup of modern day dressed Jews in prayer shaws praying as at the Wailing Wall (of two thousand years later). This scene is NOT about Jews directly; the Christian crusaders are singing about their faith, and are waiting to storm the walls to take Jerusalem from the Arab Muslims.  That aside, I think everything works well in both productions, but I would heartily recommend this one, not as an also ran, but as a viable, and fine way to get to know this opera.  After all, one should know ALL the Verdi operas, shouldn't one?  By the way, the blu ray production was top notch.  Strongly recommended.",1451347200,3,2312,4.685643564356436
8534621,5,B00925TBSG,"Who could have believed a modern Verdi production could be done so well?  It's hard to know where to begin the praise.  Firstly, there was not a weak link in cast, although surely the tenor, Francesco Meli, stands out as the next operatic superstar.  I predict that 20 years from now, his name will be a household word all over the world, on the order of Pavarotti or Domingo.  He has everything ... the voice, the looks, even the acting skills that certain other household names were lacking.  (Gee, I hope this doesn't go to his head :)

Even without Meli, it would be a five-star show.  This opera has a huge part for chorus.  I don't mean it has two or three choruses as many operas do, I mean the chorus is singing ""almost"" the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes (I am only slightly exaggerating here).  And they are difficult choruses.  The choir is singing all the consonants and vowels, not just grunting out some nonsense syllables in hard places.  The chorus did an amazing amount of work here, frankly more than the soloists, and I hope they were rewarded commensurately ...

There was only one thing wrong with the viewing experience and I would almost take away stars were it not for the outstanding artistry.  That is, the subtitles were so small and poorly engineered (white letters on a frequently white background) that they were almost completely useless.  I think one had better be familiar with I Lombardi before buying this DVD.  It would be a great 2nd purchase after the La Scala/Carreras DVD which has normal subtitles.",1409270400,,1538,4.623616236162362
8534622,2,B00925TBSG,"Normally, Im big fan of Verdi and most of the other Italian maestros. This presentation was disjointed and bouncing, sometimes without continuity.

 The continuos shifting of the camera, to the orchestra, during the performance, only made that worse.

 The purpose of watching opera is to enjoy a properly executed performance, on stage, with the proper accompanying music, not to watch the orchestra perform, the conductor manipulate the orchestra or the solo violinist make his position obvious. This aspect was so annoying and distracting, as to make the rest of the opera not worth watching.

 When the performance was over, what was even more annoying was to have to watch that solo violinist take a longer and more hammy series of bows than did the actors.

 Take a pass, on this performance.",1391990400,,798,5.038167938931298
8534623,5,B00925TBSG,"A very strong performance of one of Verdi's least known operas. Although less known, there is some really fine music in it, even if the story may be less captivating than in Verdi's later operas. The staging by Lamberto Puggelli, as well as the set and the costumes are fine. The singers will disappoint few. Superlative singing from the main characters, Pagano (Michele Pertusi), Giselda (Dimitra Theodossiou), and Oronte (Francesco Meli). It is unlikely that this opera will ever get a finer performance. Highly recommended!",1381622400,4,526,5.2
8534624,4,B00925TBSG,"Verdi's skill as a composer was clearly established by the time he came to write I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata in 1843, but he was also increasingly finding himself confined by public expectations, particularly after the success of Nabucco the previous year. In its first act alone, I Lombardi more or less sums just how adept Verdi was at establishing a dramatic situation, combining personal drama with political or nationalist sentiments, and driving it forward with a forceful musical accompaniment, but it also shows its constraints. As the opera develops, the quality of material that has largely been manufactured to fit conventional situations starts to wear thin, but there's nonetheless still a lot of great Verdi to enjoy here.

Act I of I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata sets the tone well, if the tone you are striving for is Gothic melodrama overload.  With fervent prayers (Verdi controversially setting the 'Hail Mary' to music), dark curses (""Dreadful monster of Hell!"") and dire pronouncements of torment (""More than the fire and the serpents of Hell, terror consumes my flesh!""), it's fairly standard high melodrama material for Verdi then that harks back to his first opera Oberto, but it is certainly handled with greater aplomb here. The switch to Antioch and the Holy Land and the Eastern inflections sometimes feel a little forced however, and at times it's almost like Verdi is trying his hand at the writing of sacred music in all the prayers, devout sentiments and stirring choruses.  It's not the Requiem by any means, but it is nonetheless masterfully realised, providing the kind of varied and colourful material that, with the addition of even more dramatic elements and ballets, made I Lombardi eminently suitable for rewriting in the Grand Opra style for the Paris stage as Jrusalem.

Directed by Lamberto Puggelli, the staging of the work at the Teatro Regio di Parma (and released on DVD/BD as part of the Tutto Verdi collection) is almost completely period, traditional and theatrical in a way that suits the work. Conducted by Daniele Callegari, it's a very fine musical account of the work. Other than some strange choices of background projection images (Picasso's Guernica), the lighting and colouration reflects the colours of Verdi's score and the exotic locations. Sand, a few swords and armour scattered around and a huge wall at the back that takes on literal and metaphorical significance, create exactly the right kind of imagery and tone. The literalness is challenged only at the conclusion, where the City of God is invoked and the fallen rise, but it's perfectly in keeping with the heightened tone of the finale.

The singing is also of a very high standard with no weak elements at all. Michele Pertusi is the baddie yet again playing Pagano/the hermit and does well to resist the kind of over-playing that some of the libretto seems to call for. Roberto de Biasio is a fine Arvino, though his is very much a lesser role than either Oronte or Giselda. Dimitra Theodossiou takes on the greater challenges as Giselda, including the fervent prayers and a near mad-scene at the feared death of Oronte. She's just tremendous, almost bringing the house down in Act III with Verdi's dramatic writing and arranging of events. Francesco Meli demonstrates a good Verdi tenor voice as Oronte, harmonising well with Theodossiou.  Not Verdi's finest work then, but with this kind of performance it's fully realised in a way that does justice to its merits.",1378771200,5,3494,5.025906735751295
8534625,5,B00925TBSG,"I Lombardi is an early opera of Verdi still in his ""grandiose"" style. It had served him well in his previous hit ""Nabucco"" In that opera the star of the show is the chorus and here in I Lombardi the dominant figure is again the chorus. And what a chorus it is! From the beginning to the end it's the great sound of the chorus that rivets the attention of the audience. Nabucco has it's ""Va Pensiero sul'ali dorasti"" and in I Lombardi the magnificent ""O Signore del tetto natio"". The latter was for many years the more popular. But in time I Lombardi faded from public view in Italy even after a stint in Paris as Jerusalem where Verdi somewhat refined the score.
In I Lombardi Verdi has begun to define his male voices. As in many later works the primary force in the opera is the male voices; these keep the opera going. In I Lombardi it is the baritone-bass Pagano that moves the action. He is the evil brother who later repents his sins and dies a hero. He is fantastically sung by Michele Pertusi. That deep, resonant voice still rings in my ears. In later Verdi operas it is the baritone who is the moving force in such operas as Ernani, Trovatore, Don Carlo, Rigoletto, Simon Boccanega etc. The tenor is often more of a decoration. Here we have two. The bigger role is Oronte the love interest of the soprano. He is the muslim who converts for her and Fracesco Meli with his gleaming, pure lyric voice certainly was believable and a great success. It is a voice one does not tire listening to. Roberto De Biasio displayed himself well as the younger brother though he was a bit more wooden in acting.
Verdi took longer to come to define female voices. He did not discover the mezzo-soprano until Azucena in Trovatore. Hence in the early operas the soprano is always the contrast or catalyst to the two or three main males. In I Lombardi this figure is Giselda daughter of Arvino (who almost kills her). (It is not a nice story). She is sung quite well by Dimitra Theodossiou. This is the best I've ever heard done by her. She was able to convey sweetness, love and determination in her love duets with Oronte and the drama in chastising the Lombards and her father for the massacre of the people. She had a good day.
At this stage, Verdi's use of the orchestra is at the same level as his immediate predecessors Donizetti and Rossini. The voice is the star of the show and the orchestra was to accommodate it as it does in I Lombardi. By Rigoletto Verdi had learned the subtle use of orchestration is scene painting, but in I Lombardi the dawn in the last act as a vision of Jerusalem falls flat. However even in the early operas his devices sometimes are effective.
An excellent production and recommended.",1371340800,2,2713,4.449799196787149
