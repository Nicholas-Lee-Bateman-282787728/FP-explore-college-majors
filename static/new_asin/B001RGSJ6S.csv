8337925,4,B001RGSJ6S,"We watched this movie on a hunch and wound up enjoying it very much. It has a powerful story, good acting, and beautiful scenery. Character development is sufficient to begin to really care about the main characters and have a concern for what happens to them.

There are some very intense moments and some brief nudity; it is not really suitable for children. I recommend it for adult audiences.",1406419200,2,396,4.739130434782608
8337926,2,B001RGSJ6S,"This is a remake of a Dutch film, De Poolse bruid. I can see why people liked this film but the original was better. The same actress had the lead in each, and she was much more believable as a Pole than as an Afghan. I liked the original very much.",1381363200,,249,3.9019607843137254

8337928,5,B001RGSJ6S,"My wife and I knew nothing about this film when we decided to watch it the other night. It turned out to be unexpectedly good. Set in the Australian outback (itself a selling point, since for many of us this remains a mysterious land), the isolation and inbreeding of the people (though not so much the topography) reminded me a bit of the years we spent in rural South Dakota.

The story centers around John Woldring, a reclusive fellow whose wife has died a violent death a few years earlier (a death we never find out much about). A bruised and battered woman, clad only in a raincoat, and who knows almost no English, appears on his farm one day. Although initially lacking in the ability to effectively communicate, they grow not just to understand each other but become genuinely fond of each other. What he doesn't realize initially but soon discovers is that this woman is an escaped victim of sex trafficking, and she is being hunted by the local men who ""own"" her. A further wrinkle in the plot is that she is also looking for her twelve-year-old daughter from whom she has become separated.

Although a bit slow moving at the start, this is a gripping movie and holds one's interest throughout. Moreover, the pace picks up as time goes on.

I would suggest that unless you are familiar with the Australian accent you turn on the subtitles. It would have been difficult for us to understand some of the dialogue without them.

Also, the inspiration for ""Unfinished Sky"" is a movie called ""Polish Bride."" While we haven't watched it yet, this one may also prove interesting.",1376265600,12,1583,4.642857142857143
8337929,4,B001RGSJ6S,"This is just one of the unexpected films that, due to it's unique story, grabs you quickly and won't let go.

Here's the scoop. John Woldring is a moderately successful farmer in the Australian Outback. One day he sees a woman, clad only in a yellow raincoat, running through the field. She's scared, tired and bruised. He takes her home, cleans her up and tries to find out her story. Their language barrier makes this a slow go, but when she is able to communicate on a rudimentary level, the story she tells puts them both in peril.

This is a cool concept to begin with and they play it well. The casting helps. Both the main leads do a fine job. Watching their individual transformations evolve is very satisfying. And it's no smooth sailing. There are pitfalls for both along the way. That this is set in the Outback is good as well. One gets to see the beauty of the country but also the downside of living in a cloistered community. Most of the plot points are good though the viewer does see where certain things are headed. I liked the climax a lot. The set up made me wonder how this would resolve. For me, it came together well. This is well shot and directed. The end was a bit on the sappy side. Maybe not what happened but the way it happened. Other than that this is an outstanding film.

If clever, heartfelt flicks are your poison, this should do you in.",1375401600,5,1372,4.3515625
