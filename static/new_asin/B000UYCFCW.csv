8215615,5,B000UYCFCW,"This DVD of the special from the History Channel was a steal at the $5.00 I paid.  It provides Wonderful information of what went into the end battles of the Civil War.  To the Finish: Sherman and the March to the Sea is the gruesome tale of what it took for the Union Army to convince the traitorous confederate leadership that their attempt to dissolve the Union of States was ended this once.  Their defeat at the hands of this ruthless Union General was to lead to their placement in the gutter of history where they were to live out their lives as war criminals and secessionest losers of the greatest war of our history rather than be hanged as War Criminals.  These battles defined the civil war as the terrible endeavour it was, right to end. With these confederate army defeats the South's disgusting use of humans as slaves for their gain of personal wealth they had gained and in turn would loose after this war.  Many confiderate officers got off easy because of the weakness supported by the nation's Military Training establishments and the desire to not make these traitors pay for their crimes against this nation and the people.",1374796800,,1145,4.648514851485149
