8396056,5,B003FRHVDO,"This is an excellent beginner's education on cutting with an Oxy-Acetylene torch.  The instructor is easy to listen to, has clear diction, the content is organized from the very beginning of torch cutting, including safety rules to how to turn the equipment on and why the procedure has to be performed in a certain way.  After the clear introduction, the instructor guides the learner on how to set the oxygen levels and acetylene levels to the most efficient and economical manner.  Then the learner is taken through step by step instruction on actual cutting methods, various size metals, torch tips, safety instruction, cleaning up and turning off the equipment.  As a teacher myself, I was very impressed with how simple the instruction was for a complicated process that could be a nightmare for beginners.  I highly recommend this in-depth guide to using torch cutting effectively.",1272326400,,888,5.096551724137931
