2116094,4,B0002RQ2SA,"Hooray for Thomas wasn't too bad but I was kinda hoping I'd see more of Thomas and his friends. There were too many stories about the little engines. Although, in one story, Thomas and Bertie have another race. Find out who will win this time. The story stops are:

HOORAY FOR THOMAS 7.5/8:

It is summer on the Island of Sodor and the children are having an annual sporting event, where they will compete for medals in various types of activities. Thomas wishes that he could win a medal, but Percy tells him that he must first win a race. So Thomas and Bertie have a race but Thomas is interrupted during the race because he must go collect the children's medals which have been left behind at the station. Can he get their medals on time!

EDWARD'S BRASS BAND 7.5/8:

A Brass Band is holding a concert on the Island of Sodor and Edward can't wait to meet them. One his way to meet the band, a crane accidentally knocks Edward of the track with a big ship's engine. Edward is sent to the fitter's yard and Sir Topham Hatt informs him that Bertie must meet the band instead of him. But, after a storm, Bertie has some problems with mud and the band gives off a distress signal. Who will help them?

THE REFRESHMENT LADY'S STAND 7/8:

It is a hot summer and lots of people come to the Refreshment Lady's stand for some cooling refreshments. The Refreshment Lady is planning on opening up a new stand but can't decide were it should be. There are so many ideal places like: Woodland Way, The Castle, and Whispering Waterfall. Find out how a storm will give Peter Sam a perfect idea for a new refreshment stand.

RHENEAS AND THE ROLLER COASTER 7/8:

Rheneas is to take a group of school children on a tour around the island. But Rheneas doesn't find the trip very exciting because they are all places he sees everyday. When Rheneas goes down the wrong line, the children are in for the ride of their life.

THE GRAND OPENING 7.5/8:

A new line is being opened and all the little engines are looking forward to the grand opening. Even Sir Topham and Lady Hatt are excited and plan to ride Harold for a good view. But Harold has some problems with his engine so Sir Topham Hatt moves on to plan B, a hot-air ballon. Meanwhile, all the engines are there for the grand opening except for Skarloey, who is running late. As Sir Topham and Lady Hatt are enjoying their view of the railway, the balloon runs out of hot air and they start falling from the sky. Will Skarloey be able to help them?

BEST DRESSED ENGINE 8/8:

A celebration is taking place on the Island of Sodor and alot of decorating is taking place. The engines are even allowed to be decorated. Thomas, Percy, James, and Murdoch are all very excited but Gordon, who thinks it isn't dignified, finds them rather silly. While pulled the Express, a banner falls off on a bridge and lands on Gordon's smoke box. He is decorated afterall.

""THE RED BALLOON""(music video) 6.5/8:

A music video about the time when James saved a red balloon.

Again, a great except for the fact that they didn't show Thomas enough. Expect the next Thomas video, Sodor Celebration, to come out March 8, 2005.",1108425600,3,3140,4.445993031358885
2116095,5,B0002RQ2SA,I already own every episode form the Ringo Starr era on the old videos but I plan on purchasing this DVD. The really funny thing is out of the five Ringo Starr videos made the three that were the best were all stopped being made. Tenders & Turntables is my favorite Thomas video but Thomas Breaks The Rules and Better Late then Never were my other too favorites. I'm really happy this is being made because I know there all a lot of you who never got copies of these great movies and now you are able to see the pure goodness Thomas used to be. I gurantee if you buy this set or the old videos you will want Thomas back to the way it was. If you think the new Thomas movies are good be prepared to be blown away.,1101340800,47,712,4.02112676056338
2116096,5,B0002RQ2SA,"This 3-Disc Set Of Thomas Was awesome!! All Of Season 1 and the special fetures, It's worth the $$. and it makes a great gift!",1098835200,6,126,4.08
2116097,5,B0002RQ2SA,"I would recommend this product for all children ... and all those who are children at heart.

This three DVD set contains the first season (26 episodes) of ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" as it was originally broadcast on British television in 1984 ... and it is fun and it is wonderful.

The Island of Sodor ... where these wonderful adventures take place ... would undergo some changes in the coming years, but here ... in its first year ... Thomas and his friends are at their innocent best.

Ringo Starr is the narrator here, and his charm and good nature fit perfectly with the simple innocence of the stories.  My favorite is ""Thomas & Bertie"" but ""Thomas Goes Fishing"", ""Thomas in Trouble"", and ""Coal"" are good too.

Ringo's stint as storyteller lasted only two seasons (sniff), but those 52 episodes are the ones most worth owning.  And after viewing the 26 episodes included here, I am sure you will agree that Thomas is ... a really useful engine.",1396828800,2,950,4.625
2116098,3,B0002RQ2SA,"MY GRANDSON LOVED THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE, AND HE LOVED WATCHING THEM.  HE IS 21 YEARS OF AGE NOW, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PASSED DOWN TOO A COUPLE OF OTHER GENERATION OF BOYS.  GOOD STORIES THEY ARE REALLY GREAT AND NOT JUST OKAY.",1389139200,,225,4.209302325581396
2116099,5,B0002RQ2SA,"I bought this CD for my two year old who loves Thomas. It has 26 episodes so it will take a long time for him to get to watch it all but I bought used and price was within my price range. As another reviewer stated, they call Sir Topham Hatt, the Fat Controller, so you may not be thrilled with this version or you can just discuss with your child that our culture does not think this name is polite. Some of these episodes are a little darker than the ones that they currently show on television but I find them to be more interesting. I ordered on the 14th and received on the 17th. Awesome delivery time.",1376870400,,607,4.109243697478991
2116100,5,B0002RQ2SA,I don't quite understand this whole Thomas thing for youngsters but my 2 1/2 year-old-grandson thinks it's wonderful and that's the name of that tune!,1358985600,,150,5.04
2116101,5,B0002RQ2SA,"This is a charming little DVD set, back before Thomas got redone and all about money. These are the original stories that were told in the TV show Shining Time Station. It does not include all the Ringo-told stories that are available on VHS, but it does have the first 26 in chronological order, which is a plus. Ring Starr is HANDS DOWN the BEST Thomas narrator, and will delight children as well as older fans - such as myself ;). This set is a must have for old and new Thomas fans - you will not be disappointed.",1333152000,,517,4.232323232323233
2116102,5,B0002RQ2SA,"If you have a little one that likes Thomas the Tank, this three disc set features 26 original episodes from the beginning of the series. Thomas and all his friends are in beautiful color--Gordon, Henry, and more. If you are contemplating giving this as a Christmas gift, the very last episode is Thomas' Christmas Party. Ringo Starr narrates and does a fantastic job. Disc three features some interactive games, stories and activities.",1258761600,,435,5.055555555555555
2116103,1,B0002RQ2SA,"I didn't know until last week that Sir Topham Hatt's other name was the Fat Controller.

I was originally excited that these videos were available and narrated by Ringo Starr as the original VHS versions were.  Problem is, this is his UK narration, and not the one originally on the VHS tapes that were sold in the U.S..  Maybe in Britain, referring to Sir Topham Hatt as the ""Fat Controller"" isn't a cultural problem and maybe calling someone 'fat' isn't as offensive as it seems to be in the U.S.  I just don't think it translates well here, though.  Thus, I was a little disappointed they didn't put the U.S. narration on these DVD's.  I'd rather my son know him as Sir Topham Hatt, rather than the Fat Controller.

Note that there are some other minor US/UK language differences, such as the train conductor instead being referred to as the ""guard"", etc.  Those are minor, of course.

Overall, though, this a US video with Ringo's UK narration on it, instead of the one we liked on VHS years ago...so what were they thinking?.  Call me picky, but that's how I feel about it.  I'm disappointed in this release, and I hope they re-release it with Ringo's U.S. narration at some point in the future.",1219536000,5,1200,4.5607476635514015
2116104,5,B0002RQ2SA,"My son loves it.  Thomas stories are delightful classics. Ageless, timeless, and always enjoyable.",1217462400,,98,6.0
2116105,5,B0002RQ2SA,"Not to knock any of the subsequent Thomas videos, but this is the best, closest to the great stories written by Rev. Awdry.  I specifically sought this out to be viewed while reading the stories to my child...it really brings 'm to life!  Ringo Starr is the best narrator out there for the Thomas stories...all these other actors 'n such can't hold a candle to him.  A MUST if you like Thomas!",1192320000,5,393,4.430555555555555
2116106,5,B0002RQ2SA,"I just got this for my 5 yr old son, and not only does he love it but his 3 yr old sister as well. We already had a VHS version of Better Late Than Never which was used (from my neighbor). So I already knew how much better Ringo Starr's narration is than George Carlin and Alec Baldwin. This set is great! 13 episodes on the first two disks. The sound and video quality is great. Just wish I could get more of these older stories with Ringo on DVD.",1185840000,3,448,3.934065934065934
2116107,5,B0002RQ2SA,"A year ago the Wiggles' movie 'Cold Spaghetti Western' was played every day at my house.  Now it's all about Thomas.  My 3 1/2 year old just loves it. And, just like the Wiggles' movie, I love it too.  These DVDs of the 1st season with Ringo Starr as the narrator are the best. There's a continuing storyline that runs from one episode to the next that you miss watching this on TV. The DVD's also all start playing again on their own which is great for super long car rides with handy car dvd players.

I would buy this again in a second.",1182902400,,539,4.153846153846154
2116108,5,B0002RQ2SA,"This is clearly the best collection of the best stories from the series.  They are taken directly from the original stories, and Ringo Starr is an excellent storyteller for them.  (When I read the original stories to my three year old, I now use Ringo's inflections!)

My only complaint is that these DVDs are SHORT!  Sure, they brag to collect 26 stories, but the stories are about five minutes each!  I see no reason to spread about two hours of content out over two DVDs!

That complaint out of the way, this set is true to the spirit of the original stories, capturing their charm.  (If you can't tell, I recommend getting the original stories too, and read them at bedtime.  To your child, that is, although you'll enjoy them too!)",1178064000,,736,4.564885496183206

2116110,5,B0002RQ2SA,"Ringo is the narrator.  I cannot believe the George Carlin was ever allowed or asked to narrate a children's' series.  I am glad that I finally found a set where Ringo does.
Too much repeating of dialogue!
After about a month I have found that about half of each episode is just repeated lines.
Thomas said, ""Oh no I cant stop! Oh no I cant stop.""
The trucks chuckled, ""This is fun!  This is fun.""
The fat controller said, ""Thomas a useful engine could stop.  A useful engine could stop.""

You get the idea...",1172707200,2,509,4.372340425531915
2116111,5,B0002RQ2SA,"I just purchased this set for my son who loves Thomas. I am looking forward to watching some with him. I don't think we will be disappointed as all I have read is how great the original Thomas episodes with Ringo Starr are.

2116112,5,B0002RQ2SA,My son really enjoys this video!  I was tickled to find the original stories that I remember from when I was a kid!,1163894400,2,115,4.0
2116113,4,B0002RQ2SA,"I bought it for my 3 & 5 years old boys just to introduce thomas to them.  They not only love the episodes, they love the box too.  They can even scan the box again and again without turning on the TV!

As they hadn't watch Thomas before, they were so attracted by the stories, the theme song and the pictures.  Without the advertisements and bad storylines, they enjoy being simple train fans and learn the skills of handling real-life situations, e.g. the attitude of competing with others, a thank-you heart, etc.  Even we borrowed the Thomas tapes from the library and watched, we couldn't get back the excitement of watching this set.

The only disappointment is this set doesn't have the videos of the songs.  My boys want to sing the song along when they watch.",1157414400,,768,4.562043795620438

2116115,4,B0002RQ2SA,"My 3-year-old just adores Thomas and his friends.  Personally, I find Ringo Starr and George Carlin to be the best narrators in this series.  This DVD is completely inoffensive for young children.  All the trains are a bunch of prissy old queens who fight and then learn to get along.  As an adult, I find Thomas about the same as Barney.  Annoying to me, but fine for my son who is learning to be nice to his little sister and gets the message partly through the trains learning to get along.",1141776000,5,493,4.373626373626373
2116116,5,B0002RQ2SA,"We just got this set today and have already watched the whole thing.  We were so pleased with these DVDs!

Years ago, when Thomas was new and before we had any children, we used to see it on TV and think how cute it was.  But by the time we had children, it had changed considerably.  We still like the newer Thomas stories, of course, but nothing compares to the old ones.  My favorite in this set is The Sad Story of Henry because it is just so funny.

I highly recommend this set to anyone who is a new or old fan of Thomas.  You will be so glad you have it!",1128556800,29,561,3.911504424778761
2116117,4,B0002RQ2SA,"First off, Ringo is the best narrator hands down.  Alec and George aren't bad, but I can't stand the new episodes because of the new narrator.  Getting 26 episodes for this price is well worth it.  And its really nice have 13 episodes per disc IN THE CORRECT ORDER.  I'm fairly new to the Thomas world but I would guess they re-did the voice on some of the older episodes was to make them a little more pc as the trains used to refer to Topham Hat as the Fat Controller.  Who cares.

The only reason I didn't give five stars is I would have liked to have some Thomas songs on the bonus disc.  My son is about to turn two and while he likes to watch Thomas and knows the characters, he doesn't follow the stories that well yet.  He LOVES the songs on the Best of James and Best of Thomas DVDs.  We currently have about 11 different Thomas DVDs but I'll buy more complete seasons if they ever come out with them.

To sum up, I enjoy watching the stories as much (if not more) than my son.  It's a very refreshing change from Barney and The Wiggles.  If you haven't purchased any Thomas videos I would suggest trying one that has some songs as a bonus feature. And be patient.  My son didn't go nuts for Thomas the first time he watched it (too young) but now he just loves it.  Also, I am biased because his Thomas Wooden train set is the first set of toys I like to play with as well, so its nice to have that to do with him.",1126828800,37,1424,4.057347670250896
2116118,5,B0002RQ2SA,"At first I was disappointed with how short the episodes were but then after watching a bit I was most pleased. The stories are right out of the storybook we read every night. Ringo Starr does a fabulous narrating job. But more important than any of that, my 3 year old loves them. End of review. :-)",1123545600,14,299,4.2631578947368425
2116119,3,B0002RQ2SA,"Good solid episodes and stories, but just not as lively as current PBS episodes.  Not sure these early recordings are the best match for American audiences.  Would recommend buying episodes with another commentator.  I just did, despite having bought thsi 3-disc early collection set.

Overall, highly recommend Thomas the train--just not this collection set.",1122768000,3,359,5.592592592592593

Can Peter Sam help find a new refreshment stand for the refreshment lady? There's lots of fun new stories in this DVD, including Rheneas giving the school children a roller coaster ride on the tracks and Gordon winning a best-dressed competition.

The stories themselves run about 35 minutes and include:

Hooray For Thomas

Edward's Brass Band

The Refreshment Lady's Stand

Rheneas and the Roller Coaster

The Grand Opening

Best Dressed Engine

The Bonus Features include:

Character Gallery

Read Along Story: The Great Race

Sing Along Song: The Red Balloon

3 Games: Counting Celebration, Paint Party, and Fun With Shapes

Computer Fun: Web Fun and 2 Coloring Sheets

While the stories will appeal to children of all ages, the DVD games are quite basic. This is ironic, because a child would have to be pretty advanced to work the DVD remote to access the games! By the time a child knows how to use a DVD remote, he's outgrown the games. It would be nice if the DVD games were more advanced.

Kids will love the bonus train that comes with the package. If I recall correctly, it was Mavis that came with ours. It was a ""repeat"", but my son doesn't mind that he has a few doubles of some engines...having fun with them regardless!

The actual DVD case that's in the box is quite slim...more narrow than the usual DVD cases that don't have the bonus train. The flimsiness shouldn't matter, though, as long as the DVD case is stored properly.

My son enjoys all the narrators, and doesn't seem to notice the different ones. I feel the narrator on the Hooray For Thomas DVD does just as good a job as most (save Alec Baldwin, who's my favorite)...and much better than Ringo Starr and George Carlin (in my opinion).

A very nice addition to the Thomas DVD collection.",1114041600,14,1919,4.627218934911243
2116122,4,B0002RQ2SA,"This DVD uses Michael Brandon as the narrator.  My two sons adore Thomas but they are 3 and 1, so they do prefer Michael Brandon as the narrator since they are reletively new to Thomas.  I can appreciate the history behind the excellent narations of Ringo Star, George Carlin and Alec Baldwin, but if you have a new Thomas fan, this will be the voice they are used to seeing on TV.

As far as the episodes go, they are all very good.  I do have to mention that 3 of the 6 stories involve the Mountain Branchline characters (Skarloey, Rheneas, Rusty, PeterSam, Duncan etc.) so if your kids like those guys, you must go get this DVD because those characters generally are not featured much on these DVDs.  This is a good DVD for those guys.

But, the other 3 stories involve our classic characters.  The first story has Thomas and Bertie, then Edward, and then Gordon and Toby complete the DVD.  This was very reasonably priced and if you were fortunate enough to find a copy that included a free train that makes this almost pay for itself.",1111968000,5,1039,4.431578947368421

I utterly hate the Americanized form of Thomas.
