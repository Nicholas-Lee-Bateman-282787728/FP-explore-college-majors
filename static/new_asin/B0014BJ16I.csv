8254921,3,B0014BJ16I,"No doubt about it, Clayton can play the brushes with the best of them. His approach to brushes, creating brush rudiments, etc. is unique too. Any drummer serious about playing brushes should indeed check him out. There are 2 DVD's in this package --- the first shows the techniques, and the second features Clayton playing with a band. I've waited a long time for Clayton's brush instruction to come out on DVD, so I'm glad I have this now.

That said, I deducted some stars because as an instructional video for this price, it could be better. Overall, I think Steve Smith's brush DVD is a better package with far more to offer for the price.",1457827200,,643,4.543103448275862
8254922,4,B0014BJ16I,"Content is great but, I wish this would have had the Brushworks book along with it.  I think the price is a bit much with just the DVD.",1433376000,,135,3.8214285714285716
8254923,5,B0014BJ16I,Clayton IS the master when it comes to brushes. So much material and inspiration to work on and draw from.,1424131200,,106,4.35
8254924,4,B0014BJ16I,This is a great dvd for the novice to experienced drummer. The brush rudiments are well worth the price alone. Cameron's work his band is ice on the cake.,1357257600,,154,4.344827586206897
8254925,5,B0014BJ16I,"Using writing metaphors, this instructional DVD would be the thesaurus - a tool that is very useful once you have a basic vocabulary (in the case of brush playing I feel that Ed Thigpen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Essence-of-Brushes-DVD/dp/B0002VEPN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Essence of Brushes (DVD)</a>&nbsp;provides that, while the ""creative writing"" aspect is provided by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Playing-with-Brushes-DVD-Play-Along-CD/dp/B000WPG0WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Playing with Brushes DVD/Play Along CD</a>.

Like Ed Thigpen's DVD, this one is instructional. Steve Smith's and Adam Nussbaum's DVD is more of an example by performance with many examples of how to play the same music in different ways, but no specific ""how to's"". Like Ed Thigpen, Clayton steps you through the basics, starting with various grips and when they are appropriate. Here he covers German, French, cradle, eastern and matched, mixing and matching them in the left and right hands. Then he goes into lessons on sweeps, taps, and other parts of the brush vocabulary to show how to achieve the best sound for the music you support. What I liked is how, after each lesson, he demonstrated it with just a bass player, then with a band. The bass only demonstrations reinforce just how important the bassist and drummer are to each other, and you will get some solid ideas about how to lock in.

You need to be aware that Clayton's teaching style is different from Ed Thigpen's style. Where Ed patiently demonstrates a technique and reinforces it with additional instruction, Clayton goes through each technique, using the performances as a reinforcement tool. You'll find yourself frequently stopping the DVD in order to fully grasp what Clayton is teaching.

One aspect of Clayton's approach that I like is the way he varies his accents in each lesson (and then reinforcing the lesson with the mini performances). This approach draws much from George Lawrence Stone's seminal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stick-Control-For-the-Snare-Drummer/dp/1892764040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stick Control: For the Snare Drummer</a>, and is an approach that I have not come across anywhere else. This is where the thesaurus analogy comes in. You not only receive a solid vocabulary, but you learn the synonyms that allow you to create with brushes what authors do with words - nuance, communication, pace. In fact, when I was going through the lessons I kept remembering Mel Lewis' approach to using up beats to propel music (when appropriate, of course), and Johnny Vidacovich's long discussion of the same thing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Orleans-Drumming/dp/B0001XALWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Orleans Drumming</a>. However, Clayton goes beyond just demonstrating up- and downbeat accents, by varying them to show the effect on the music of where the accent is placed.

Another aspect of this DVD is the brush-specific rudiments that Clayton has developed. While others have also created rudiments for brushes, Clayton's make the most sense to me.

In addition to the lessons, on DVD #1 there are three performance related clips that are must watch. The first is how Clayton was inspired by tap dancers. This is a recurring theme in any serious discussion about brushplaying - Papa Jo Jones talks at length about tap dancing in The Drums and in his oral biography, and in the booklet that comes with The Art of Playing with Brushes Mark Griffith wrote an excellent piece on the same topic. However, Clayton, teamed with the renowned tap dancer Chester Williams, does a duet of sorts with Williams, with Williams doing the hoofing, while Clayton plays the same rhythms, showing how tap dancing can inspire brush playing. The second performance is a jaw-dropping clip with Clayton's brush solo on a wood djembe. The final performance on DVD #1 is a snare drum solo, in which he does amazing brushwork using three snare drums. DVD #2 in the set is a set of full performances with a band to further demonstrate and reinforce the lessons.

In summary, this is not an easy DVD to plow through, but it is also not insurmountable. If you take the time to work through it - as many times as necessary - it will pay big dividends.",1335052800,,4440,5.6591591591591595
8254926,3,B0014BJ16I,"So I just finished going through both DVDs. One is instructional, one is a trio performance. I would recommend this to anyone interested in brush playing because there are only a couple of dvds out there currently and this is still less expensive than a private lesson with a great player, so from that perspective it is a good value. On the instructional DVD Clayton shows a number of different (simple) patterns and ways of keeping time. It is is well paced for sitting there and playing along. There is then a section on ""brush rudiments"" but he goes through them at speed and doesn't break them down so you have to pay really close attention and figure out what he's doing and even then it is difficult. There is no booklet showing them either. The performance DVD is good, they don't always, but often show 2 views of Clayton so you can see his playing from behind, which is great. My biggest critique however, is that the distance between his examples with the band and the examples in the instructional section are light years apart. He doesn't cover how he moves between the patterns or fits in fills or anything very complicated. So even if you master all his techniques you might still watch him and wonder exactly how he is approaching things in a real musical context. For example the band plays both a waltz and a samba and he discusses neither. I don't know if this was deliberate or just lazy, but once you get up to speed on the basics, you want more. And he really is a phenomenal brush player so it's unfortunate he doesn't provide more insight. There are some real gems - the tap dance influence section is really cool and really shows the connection between tap dancing and jazz drumming. But overall it just seems a little half-assed. IMHO at least.",1303171200,,1770,4.551724137931035
