8220785,4,B000VZZSGU,Very informative but light on music. You can get alot of info from the critics and their reviews throughout the Floyd's career.,1357171200,2,127,4.818181818181818
8220786,5,B000VZZSGU,It's David Gilmour. What more needs to be said? It is an excellent production. Audio and video is very well produced.,1322697600,3,117,4.619047619047619
8220787,4,B000VZZSGU,"Short of Jimi Hendrix, the greatest of all times, David Gilmour is one of the greater guitar players as well. His style and mastery is legendary, and this review spans it well.",1202860800,5,176,4.53125
8220788,1,B000VZZSGU,I would definitely think twice before purchasing this DVD. I'm a huge Floyd / Gilmour fan and this falls way short of what I hoped for ! Mostly stills and not much complete misic !!!!,1200787200,8,183,4.257142857142857
8220789,4,B000VZZSGU,"I wasn't to sure about this one as most "" reviews "" along this line are pretty sketchy and use music performed by performers other than who you're buying the disc for but I was pleasently surprised by this one.
 If you are a Pink Floyd Fan or a David Gilmour fan most of the information here won't be a surprise but it is presented well and for once the music is performed by Gilmour and in my opinion is worth buying.",1200614400,17,418,4.097560975609756
