4311053,3,B004ASDNNE,"The videos recorded on this product are very old and have not been digitally remastered. A great Idea for a product would be the complete Burns and Allen series digitally remastered.
I was disappointed in the DVDs but they are what they are. Just watch the series on METV. and buy something else.",1388188800,3,296,4.60377358490566
4311054,4,B004ASDNNE,Like I said I love to watch them especially Gracie but I wish there would have been more than 16 episodes I was disappointed about that,1387238400,,135,4.230769230769231
4311055,1,B004ASDNNE,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my father. First, when we tried to watch them for the first time, the DVD skipped. I took it out to see if it had gotten smudged and noticed it was a purple disc. In other words, it was just a burned DVD (and poorly burned at that). So we tried to put the pirated DVD back in the player and it then wouldn't work at all. We just kept getting a ""Disc Error"" message.

Second, to the extent that it did work, the sound and picture quality was awful. I watch reruns of this show on TV and the TV is far superior in quality.

I love George and Gracie, but do not buy this particular product and do not buy from this seller.",1383091200,15,656,3.924812030075188
4311056,5,B004ASDNNE,"Some of the best shows are included on these DVDs, everyone young & old enjoy them! Thank you for keeping some of the best actors/ comedians alive in our hearts!",1382659200,,161,4.4
4311057,5,B004ASDNNE,My husband & I laughed so much the children came to see what was so funny. I laugh over and over. George and Gracie make a great team.,1376956800,2,134,3.8214285714285716
4311058,4,B004ASDNNE,"I was surprised to find the built in commercials for Carnation Evaporated Milk.  I suppose I didn't remember that far back. While I found the episodes to be great timeless keepsakes, I would love to have a couple of dvds with later episodes excluding the commercials. George Burns and Gracie Allen were forerunners for the I Love Lucy series.",1371772800,,342,4.796610169491525
4311059,3,B004ASDNNE,"A whole bunch of yrs. ago I was home recovering from a surgery when I discovered them on a channel playing their old reruns. I'd watched them & laugh so hard it hurt my stiches.
So when I saw this on Amazon I ordered it. I've only watched it once. It's not quite as funny as the ones I saw back then. It's grainy black & white, like 1950 TV. It didn't cost very much and I'm glad so it was worth it to me.",1371772800,5,405,3.776470588235294
4311060,1,B004ASDNNE,"This is a horrible product. The quality of the video is really bad.  It looks like someone just recorded it off tv with awful reception.  Save your money - do not buy this video.

We are huge fans of this show and watch it on our own TV - thought we would like to have this in our video file - we should have just recorded it ourselves off our tv with good receiption.

4311061,5,B004ASDNNE,These two are hillarious. Gracie Allen will crack you up. I can't enough of these two. I just love watching them. They have been coming on one of the didgital channels and I get to see them on TV every now and then.,1314921600,9,215,4.023255813953488

4311065,1,B004ASDNNE,"I bought 2 of these; one for me and one for our oldest son. Just opened mine tonight and it didn't work, neither disk. So we opened his and it didn't work, either. We kept getting an error message on the computer screen. These are a great bargain and I am hoping the replacements work that amazon is sending (thank you, Amazon!) but if not we will be so disappointed. :(  I'll update after I receive the new disks and hopefully those will work fine!

UPDATED after receiving recplacements: they are now on their way back to Amazon because they next set of 2 didn't work either. BOO! After reading the customer reviews this time I see I SHOULD have done that before I ever ordered them in the first place. I am surprised Amazon continues to sell these seeing that they aren't working a good bit of the time.",1453507200,2,806,4.366666666666666

4311069,5,B004ASDNNE,"I am just a 50 yr old who loves these old shows. I would like to get more seasons but when last I checked they were more expensive than this season, so I will wait.",1433721600,,164,3.7142857142857144
4311070,5,B004ASDNNE,"Love Burns and a Allen always have been such a fan of Gracie! Note some of the shows are fuzzy and a bit unclear visually, but for the price point I am happy. I love the carnation comercials peppered through out the show, so hooky but cute. the 2nd volume of the shows is much clearer than the first volume. If you are looking for a prefect presentation via dvd this isn't it, but I did really enjoy both volumes even with some shows not as clear as I would of liked, but again folks the price was so right, and they are fun.",1432598400,,525,4.0576923076923075

4311075,2,B004ASDNNE,I ordered this for my mother in law as was very disappointed.  The sound on the tape was horrible you could hardly hear what they were saying at times.  I should have sent it back.,1418342400,,180,4.114285714285714

4311080,1,B004ASDNNE,I bought this as a gift for my mother.  Only one disc worked properly.  When I had the chance to get it back from her it was too late to return it.  My mother was disappointed to say the least.,1394668800,3,193,3.775
4311081,1,B004ASDNNE,volume 1 played nicely.  we enjoyed it.  Volume 2 would not play at all because it had not lead-in or lead out.  We sent the Two-Disc Edition back for a refund.  I tried Disk 2 in 5 different players that were both BLU-RAY and standard def but had no luck getting Disk 2 to play even though material was burned on the disk.  It's too bad because my wife and I love the Burns & Allen Show.,1393372800,3,388,3.987012987012987

CD volume 2 was completely blank. It showed that nothing was recorded on it. I am deeply disappointed in Alpha Video's quality control.",1496966400,,281,4.529411764705882
8420797,1,B004ASDNNE,"Bought this on March 11 and just got around to popping in tonight. For BOTH discs, the whole tv screen is just green, while I hear the audio stare. Tried in two players with same results. Discs are obviously burned, not stamped. Apparently my return window closed on April 11, so its too late for me. But not for you.
