However, I own the companion book and found that it contained a great deal of information on the subject of fly fishing and decided to give the DVD a try. The DVD is definitely not edited by a Hollywood producer, but what it lacks in cinema sophistication it makes up for in solid information.  I have been fly fishing for the last 16 years and still learned valuable information from the DVD.  It is of equal value for the beginner as well.  After watching the DVD, my wife (who has never expressed an interest in fly fishing) asked if she could join me on my next fishing trip. If you are serious about learning to be a better fly fisherman then this is an excellent resource. No fly fishing library would be complete without it.",1193788800,,820,4.410596026490066
8073169,1,B000A31L5U,"I hate to be the bad guy but this video deserves at best 1.5 stars.  It has an extremely amaterish presentation, complete with shaky camera, strong distracting background noise, poor non-concrete information, and lots of stuttering from the star.  The guy really needs to take a speech class.  What can i say.

That was it.  Coundn't take it anymore.  Production quality, speech quality, information quality were all just poor.

8073170,5,B000A31L5U,"Filled with practical information, this video offers a liftime of fly fishing wisdom. The presentation has a simple home movie quality (no computerized special effects or rock-guitar sound tracks). The disc is divided into multiple chapters based on subject -- much like viewing the ""best of"" out-takes from your Grandpa's fishing trip videos. The topics range from reading streams, rivers and lakes, to presentation techniques, to wading and tubing, and even fishing safety and etiquette.

You'll watch two seasoned anglers bring in and release fish after fish with the simplest equipment immaginable (maybe we really don't need a $700 Sage rod with a $300 Ross reel to catch trout). Watching this video a couple of times will help you catch more fish...  and probably save you lots of grief by avoiding the school-of-hard-knocks lessons these two anglers had to learn for themselves. A gold mine of fly fishing knowledge!",1158192000,4,923,5.1879194630872485
8073171,4,B000A31L5U,"This DVD is combined text and video.  It is not a DVD that you sit back and watch straight through as a video.  It looks like a couple of old Utah fish biologists did it with a handheld digital camera, so the result is definately not slick and polished.  However, it is competent, and has much good information, especially the text component, on a wide variety of subjects.

I have some pretty serious problems with the casting demonstration, and if you want thorough treatement you probably ought to look at the Joan Wolff DVD.

You are probably better off using this on a computer with DVD, which is where I am watching it, than on a TV DVD player.  It's organized basically by chapters and it is more useful if you have something like a mouse to select what you want to look at.  It really looks like it was intended to be used as a supplement for some form of high school or junior college outdoor recreations course.",1147651200,7,921,4.414201183431953

8073173,5,B000A31L5U,"Beautiful visuals.  Makes even a non-outdoorsman long for nature.  Interesting techniques, several I had never seen before.  Clear demonstrations.

All that, and possible course credit too!
