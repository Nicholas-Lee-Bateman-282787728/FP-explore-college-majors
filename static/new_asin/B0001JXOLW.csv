8013501,5,B0001JXOLW,This is a very good movie. I bought this movie at Walmart for 3 dollars. It's about a crazy girl who wants to be in love so bad that she kills and gets away with it. And her cheating boyfriend who's engaged to be married took the fall for something she's done.,1286841600,2,260,4.019230769230769
8013502,4,B0001JXOLW,"Psycho-babe Janet Flanders puts a deranged twist on the theory of getting results with positive thinking, making her fantasies come true, even if only in a warped, insane way; she is outwardly all hearts and flowers, sweetness and light, but a dark heart hides within. Jordan Ladd is excellent as Janet, believable as both the innocent romantic fool, and the manipulative, sultry temptress. Vincent Spano is good as the object of Janet's desire, Brett Becker. Brett is a two-timing operator on the fast track to the big time, when he gets caught in Janet's web, and his life starts to unravel.

Stealing the show in the last part of the film is Holland Taylor (""The Practice""), as defense attorney Evelyn McGinnis. I doubt if any court in the land would allow such antics (though some have come close), but the sharp wit of her dialog, and the timing of her delivery, is a joy to watch. Her scenes are fabulous, and pull this film up to a higher level.

Made for cable TV, the film is based on a story by Mark Frost, with a script by Frost and director Sollace Mitchell. Music is by Dennis McCarthy, and cinematography by James Bagdonas. Others in the cast include Mimi Kuzyk, Jayne Heitmeyer, and John Ralston. Though there are several sizable holes in the plot, the film is entertaining fare, with some excellent performances. Total running time is 90 minutes.",1121904000,9,1362,4.718487394957983
