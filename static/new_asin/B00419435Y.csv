8412583,3,B00419435Y,"Similar to the global warming film, ""The Age of Stupid,"" this movie advocates many small-scale changes to homes, farms, and factories.  The issue with such as approach, ""that every little bit counts"", is that many microscopic changes only amount to single digit changes in carbon output today (2014).  As the British physicist David J.C. MacKay, writes in ""Sustainable energy:  without the hot air"" (website and book), the cumulative numbers on small and personal-size changes add up to only so much in results.

In fact, even with residential solar, personal recycling, and some electric cars, total world CO2 emissions have increased dramatically over the last 20 years.  So, while the aims of this film are good, the means it focuses on are week.  Still, the interviews and travel aspects of the video make it worth viewing.  Conservation is important but it can't handle climate disruption and what James Lovelock calls ""global heating"" on its own.",1419379200,,952,5.142857142857143
8412584,5,B00419435Y,"This film not only makes a strong case for the need to stop global warming, it also gives everyday people practical steps they can take to reduce their energy consumption and overall impact on the planet.  A very tangible and meaningful film.",1353888000,,242,4.761904761904762
8412585,4,B00419435Y,"This is my first review of a DVD purchase. I liked the video,but thought it is a little too long.

I've gotten three identical emails on a review for one and the same purchase on the same day. Sort of makes me wonder what's wrong with my purchase records.",1311292800,,255,4.204081632653061
8412586,5,B00419435Y,"This documentary is pretty nice, we really enjoyed watching it.

There is a nice balance in this documentary of things you and I can do as individual households and what the big industries can do AND are doing today. As a scientist it's fascinating to see all the different efforts that are ongoing to go green and bring down our carbon footprint. Some solutions seem more promising then others, but all together there is a lot done, which is promising, although we still have a long way to go in a short period of time.

It was also very interesting to see the active role China has been taking. China has received a lot of bad publicity over the years with their cheap productions and their dirty industry. This documentary was eye opening. China has made a serious effort to bring down their carbon footprint, and continues to do so. The documentary also shows that Germany is struggling to ""force"" their people to go more green. In addition it shows that Texas, another underdog in my mind, is making a difference next to the more obvious player like Oregon. Again a nice balance and a wealth of information. Too much to absorb all at once, but we wouldn't mind watching it again...

For those of you that want to make a difference at home and want to know where the big players are ..... this would be your movie to watch!!

Nicely done!",1310774400,5,1342,4.510288065843621
8412587,5,B00419435Y,I love seeing these wonderful Portland-based indie movie projects! I will always support them and follow your recommendations for making this a better planet.,1299110400,2,158,5.625
8412588,5,B00419435Y,"Deep Green is a 2010 documentary on climate change. Like other documentaries it looks at interconnectivity of systems in the world. Unlike many documentaries on climate change it spends its time looking at what is going right.

I found it full of new information, but not an exciting movie. If you are a teacher and are showing it to a class, multiple sessions are best, not a double period.

Strength of this movie is the prototype approach to the solution. It gives the spotlight to those doing it right. People that are interviewed usually run a successful financial enterprise doing green things.

Two projects covered were of particular interest to me.
New architecture: Health center that brings in and takes away minimal resources. Im not used to looking at buildings as self sufficient structures, and I am glad someone does.
Going back to roots: Analyzing traditional sustainable housing methods. How rainwater was used to cool and provide water for the community.

Overall, this documentary is worth watching because its so different from other documentaries. There is new information here, and possible contacts if you are an entrepreneur.

Final note. On amazon this movie is sold by the author, which is a nice touch. Allows you to support the movie directly.",1291939200,10,1272,5.038095238095238
