8694133,4,B00R4VUFI0,A unique look at the internal and external conflicts faced by an atheist Arab immigrant and his family. Well done.,1475020800,,114,4.75
8694134,4,B00R4VUFI0,"This chronicles the life of a film maker born in Iraq who along with his family leaves Iraq for safety in the United States. He meets a girl, gets married, becomes a citizen and then gets attacked. This is made to ponder his existence. Some swearing and what appears to be an actual child birth.

Includes in the extras the movie 'Nice bombs' as he goes back to Iraq with his wife in 2003 to see how the war has impacted his family. Insightful.",1473120000,,444,4.285714285714286
8694135,4,B00R4VUFI0,"This is a pretty low-budget independent documentary that could have used a bit of polish and editing from someone other than the director/narrator, who is clearly extremely close to the subject (a lot deals with his own childhood, personal experience, and family, probably too much, such as showing, bizarrely, the birthing of his daughter), and some of the cuts and shots feel uncomfortably amateurish.  But nevertheless, I found this to be very touching and thought-provoking, and I appreciated that it didn't preach a one dimensional message.  Arab-Americans are portrayed as a very complex and diverse group, where different members of the community view politics, culture, and identity in greatly different ways.",1469145600,,717,5.45045045045045
8694136,5,B00R4VUFI0,"On the one hand, this is an intimately personal documentary by filmmaker Usama Alshaibi about what it is like growing up Arab in America, but it also includes several other Arab subjects, giving a broad range of vision of this unique minority in this country. Very enlightening and informative; and will hopefully spark a wider discussion.",1434672000,2,339,5.071428571428571
8694137,5,B00R4VUFI0,"Challenge your stereotypes about Arab-Americans, and watch this movie. Alshaibi did a wonderful job of allowing me to see and feel what life is like for people courageous enough to leave their country of origin -- their roots -- to escape danger and oppression out of a desire to find a better life for themselves and their families. Isn't that what we all want? Safety, stability, and the opportunitiy to prosper in our own way.  The way forward out of small-minded scapegoating is to understand and see the world through the eyes of the targeted group. This film takes us in this direction.",1428796800,3,592,4.747572815533981
8694138,5,B00R4VUFI0,"Dynamic portrayal of what it is to be Arab - American in the USA in this time.. As an Arab-American myself, I was comforted to see some of my own experience reflected back to me.",1428364800,,178,4.114285714285714
