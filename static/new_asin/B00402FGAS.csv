4237821,5,B00402FGAS,I enjoyed watching these movies from the past. delivery was not great though it took a very long time to get this product. I had made several other purchases and they all came before i got this one even though it was ordered for the others. But still the product is in great shape,1374883200,,280,4.203703703703703
4237822,5,B00402FGAS,I haven't seen most of these movies in years but it's well worth the price to get this collection. Great deal!,1369008000,,110,4.285714285714286
4237823,4,B00402FGAS,"If you love cheesy 80's teen movies, this is a pretty good collection.  I don't know about most of you but when I look to buy DVD's I want to know one thing.  Is it or is it not enhanced for widescreen tv's (anamorphic)?  Five out of the six films in this package are indeed anamorphic, the only one that is not is Losin' It which is full screen leaving you with black bars on the side of the screen.  Of course, the main reason I got this set was for Losin' It, but I don't think that film is available in anamorphic at all in the US.  So, what can you do?",1367366400,,557,3.893805309734513
4237824,4,B00402FGAS,"I loved some of the movies, but didn't know some of them either.  Haven't watched them yet but look interesting...",1364169600,,114,4.7
4237825,5,B00402FGAS,This is a the most perfect 80's package of movies! I loved every one of them and am very happy with my purchase!,1363219200,4,112,3.9130434782608696
4237826,5,B00402FGAS,"Since I am an '80's kind of guy, I enjoy watching movies of my youth. This collection is perfect for this kind of viewing. Hope you make more collections just like this one.",1361232000,,173,4.2727272727272725
4237827,3,B00402FGAS,all of the movies where exactly what i expected them to be.they where all filled with 80's teenage sexual fun.,1321142400,,110,4.55
4237828,4,B00402FGAS,"I have not watched them all so I'll update when I do.
The Last American Virgin - 5/5 Stars.
These are classic 80's coming of age movies. I highly recommend it.",1302825600,4,159,4.161290322580645
4237829,4,B00402FGAS,"VALLEY GIRL: Deborah Foreman is the adorable, pampered, and sheltered titular Valley Girl. Nick Cage is the slightly goofy but seriously in-love punk guy from the wrong side of the tracks. It's an age old story but it's done very well here. It's brimming with life, humor and everything '80's. This is one of the best romantic comedies ever made.

THE RACHEL PAPERS: A British teen ""dramedy"" about an unlikely couple getting together in 80's Britain. Dexter Fletcher plays the fella as a sort of wise-a$$ Jesse Eisenberg (I know he predates Eisenberg) and Ione Skye plays the girl as...the beautuful Ione Skye. She is seriously irresistible in this. It seems like a British take on FERRIS BUELLER meets SAY ANYTHING but I think it's a little deeper than those movies and also a little more serious.

LOSIN' IT: This is a pretty standard teen-age sex romp, starring Tom Cruise, Shelly Long and Jackie Earle Hailey. Woody, Dave, Spider & Wendell head to sunny Tijuana to blow off steam and lose their virginity. Shelly Long stops by long enough to arrange a quickie divorce from her husband and maybe bump uglies with Tom Cruise. It's made in the 80's but set in the 60's.

THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN: This may be even better than Valley Girl. It starts out as a goofy teen sex comedy but ends up with some very real things to say about heartbreak, envy and unrequited love. I recommend it highly.

CLASS: Wee Andy McCarthy attends an all boys boarding school and becomes BFF's with Rob Lowe. Then Lowe's majorly hot mom meets wee Andy and makes a man out of him. Severe awkwardness ensues. It's a little funny and Jackie Bisset is the stuff of teen age boy's dreams.

ZAPPED! Every group has a kid who everyone else wants to beat up on, and in this group of movies, this movie is that kid. Does that make sense? Zapped is about a young genius (Scott Baio) who accidently develops amazing psychic powers. His bestest buddy Willie Aimes, as would most teenager guys, thinks they should be used primarily to score with girls. It's basically harmless and silly fun, also starring a spectacular Heather Thomas.",1287619200,41,2102,4.685636856368563
4237830,5,B00402FGAS,Great collection! Great price! Really takes me back to growing up in the 80's!,1448323200,,78,4.642857142857143
4237831,4,B00402FGAS,"This is quite simply an excellent collection of some classic 80's films.

'Valley Girl', 'Class', 'The Rachel Papers', and 'Last American Virgin' were all great.
'Zapped' was a bit too goofy for my tastes and 'Losing It' seemed dated and the humor fell flat.

The picture quality on all of the films was really good except for 'Losing It'.
At less than $12, this is definitely a great deal.",1447891200,2,390,4.63768115942029
