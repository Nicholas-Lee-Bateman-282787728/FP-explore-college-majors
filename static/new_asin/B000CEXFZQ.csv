2460855,3,B000CEXFZQ,"This DVD set is described as the ""Complete Series"" of the Scooby Doo Dynomutt Hour. Yet, several reviewers have stated that it is only Season One, and is not complete. They mention that there are more seasons, such as Two thru Three, and perhaps a Fourth. What is the truth?? Is this the ""Complete Series,"" or not?? I'd never heard of the Dynomutt Hour before today, when I purchased this DVD set. I'm going to be disapppointed if it turns out that it really is not a ""complete"" set. If not, then why not label it as the ""Complete First Season?""  Are the Second and Third Seasons actually the ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" Series? Can anyone out there clear up these questions for me??",1142985600,2,684,4.472
2460856,4,B000CEXFZQ,"I was glad to finally see the first season of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" released. This, along with ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" and ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"", are my favorite Scooby-Doo series. While this series is not quite as good as ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"", I find it quite enjoyable to watch. In fact, some of my favorite Scooby-Doo episodes are in this set, including High Rise Hair Raiser, Watt a Shocking Ghost, and Mamba Wamba and the Voodoo Hoodoo. It also has my favorite Scooby-Doo theme song.

The picture and sound quality are very good (well, as good as mono sound can be), at least for the Scooby-Doo episodes (the picture for the Dynomutt episodes is not nearly as clean). The special features are another plus, definitely better than any of the previous Scooby-Doo collections. I especially liked the ""In Their Own Words"" segment, since I've wanted to see interviews with the great voice talent on the show for a long time. I was really impressed by Frank Welker, who does the voice for Dynomutt in addition to Fred, and can also do quite a range of sound effects. I also enjoyed the segment on the history of the show, ""Eerie Mystery Of Scooby-Doo And Dynomutt's History"".

The one complaint I have is about the packaging. The way the discs are arranged makes it hard to take them out - on each side of the box one disc partially covers the other, so you sometimes have to remove one disc just to get to another. This leads to the potential for scratching the discs, in addition to being inconvenient. I would have preferred to have separate, non-overlapping places to store each disc, as in the other Scooby-Doo box sets.

Overall, I liked this set and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Scooby-Doo, particularly the ""vintage years"" (1969-78). I look forward to the release of the remaining episodes of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"".",1142812800,18,1857,4.672782874617737
2460857,3,B000CEXFZQ,"The release of the ""Scooby Doo-Dynomutt Hour""' series is a nice thing for die-hard cartoon fans to add to their collections. For strictly-Scooby fans, however, it would have been preferable to have seen other episodes of The Scooby Doo Show re-released, since its first season, when it was paired with Dynomutt, is the least interesting of the series. Hopefully the last 2 seasons of The Scooby Doo Show, aired without the Dynomutt segments, will make it to DVD in the future. The third season, as another customer has alluded to, was the best of this later incarnation of Scooby.

I received my pre-ordered copy of the new set on March 9, and although I haven't viewed all the shows yet, it's been fun watching some that I haven't seen since I was a kid.

Unfortunately, the quality of the animation and story lines in this Scooby series are inferior to the two seasons of the original 1969-71 ""Scooby Doo, Where are You?"" show. Did the animators just run out of ideas? A ghost bull, a walking shark monster, and several other unfrightening ghouls (a couple of which are unimaginatively based on the first series' characters), are among the weak and cheesy bad guys to be seen on the new release.

In my opinion the best of the episodes are ""The Headless Horseman of Halloween"" and ""The No-Faced  Zombie Chase Case."" The rest just seem lackluster to me.

Having said that, this set is still much better than the woefully-condensed New Scooby Movies selection that came out a year or so ago.

My other complaints about the new ""Scooby Dynomutt"" DVD set have to do with the way the box is packaged. First of all, the discs are arranged in an inconvenient way, actually resting atop one another which makes them harder to remove and replace. The arrangement also increases the risk of the discs getting scratched or otherwise damaged. On top of this inconvenience, two of the discs (3 & 4) are devoid of artwork because they're double-sided, and the special features are not listed according to the discs on which they appear (you have to search to find them). This seems a cheap, unattractive solution to packaging for such a megabucks company as Warner.

I do have high praise for the special features included in this release. They are the best of any Scooby box set issued so far. The interviews with the producers, artists, writers and cast are really entertaining for those fans who enjoy the history of Scooby and Hanna Barbera. The ""In Their Own Words"" segment is a real treat; it was the first time I've ever seen an interview with actress Nicole Jaffe who voiced Velma, my personal favorite of the characters. I couldn't believe how much she looks like her cartoon alter-ego.

There's a lot of fascinating trivia contained in these interviews, and that alone makes the new ""Scooby-Dynomutt"" release worth buying. I apologize for not mentioning my impression of the Dynomutt portion of this box set. I'm just not a fan of the character and have actually skipped over those shows after watching the Scooby parts.",1142121600,11,3018,4.75717017208413
2460858,5,B000CEXFZQ,"Although a Season 3 release would have been better, this is still a great set (unofficial 4th season?, not sure). Dynomutt was a good show and had some great episodes And to those complaining about ""adding"" Dynomutt to this set-it was ""The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour"", an episode from each show.

I will disagree with ""John Q. Public"" when he says ""there is a reason why Dynomutt hasn't been on the air for 26 years."" In fact, it was shown on the Boomerang Channel just a few short years ago. There's still alot of great shows that haven't seen the light of day in 26 years!",1141344000,4,572,4.5
2460859,5,B000CEXFZQ,"Getting the old Dynomutt series on DVD will be a joy.  It's been ages since it was on TV, and I hold the crazyness of it fondly in my memories.  Of particular note were the bizarre assortment of villains that raised the show up a notch by parodying the illogical and idiotic villains that were the standard of the its time in all forms of media.  Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon took satire to the extreme, doing battle with such antagonists as The Blimp, who inflated his victims into helpless balloons while he robbed the city blind.  In this age of addressing Jokers, Riddlers, and Penguins realistically, Dynomutt is a reminder that we shouldn't be taking our superheroes and their worlds so seriously.",1140048000,26,703,4.691056910569106

The mysteries are a little better than the originals, as is the pacing of the story. And much better than the early-70's ""Scooby-Doo Movies."" Dynomutt segments are fun, too, but focus more on action than on mystery-solving. Both series are a good nostalgia trip for those who grew up in the 70's.",1509062400,,388,4.8059701492537314

I don't wanna pay $20+ and get a show I don't even want, unless the Scooby episodes were on their own disc then I could toss the Dynomutt episodes and print out my own packaging for the Scooby episodes for my collection. I don't want to have to skip every other episode when I wanna marathon Scooby. Nor do I wanna have to sit through Dynomutt. It doesn't make since why this was released on DVD instead of just releasing them separate, especially when both shows are still missing episodes not even found on this set.

EDIT: It seems I was mistaken, as these episodes were newly produced for this programming block and only titled The Scooby-Doo Show in syndication. However, still seems silly for them to be released on DVD like that, since they edited them from their original broadcast versions anyway.

EDIT con't: All the Scooby episodes are available in the Amazon Instant Video store, INCLUDING the missing 8 from what is considered the second season of The Scooby-Doo Show, and it's the same price as this DVD except you get more Scooby episodes that aren't available, and you don't have to buy the Dynomutt episodes!",1408752000,,1296,4.581896551724138

With that said, I am perturbed that Warner Brothers continues 1) to use labels like ""complete"" and ""original"", etc. when for one reason or another, episodes are left out, 2) to omit opening/closing songs/credits, and 3) to give us just ""good enough"" restoration of the prints.

Some Scooby episodes I am excited for are: High rise hair raiser, The ghost of the bad humour man, Scared a lot in Camelot, Headless horseman of Halloween, and the gator ghoul. In A bum steer for Scooby, the monster looks very familiar. It kind of remind me of Decoy for a dognapper of of where are you. Still a great episode. I hope I get dvd for Christmas. Yeah I don't have it yet :(. I will update this review when I have it.",1352937600,,606,4.100840336134453
2461120,4,B000CEXFZQ,"I waited a long time to  finally  purchase this. The main reason being that  dynomutt was  attached with scooby. I remember  seeing a few episodes on  boomerang of  dynomutt, and he  just  seems  a little too over the top for me.

I just wanted the joy  of owning  more  scooby episodes from the 1970s. Eventually i did give in when the  price  was right.  Most of these episodes are worth the watch. There are a few I wasn't  overjoyed  about but you take the good with the mediorce.

You can  sort of tell by this point  that  thay are seriously  starting to  rehash  previous  episodes. A few examples of this  are  like ""the bum steer for scooby"". This was  obviously  another  take on the  original  episode from  sesaon  1 about the  dognapper that had a suspciously  similar looking  costume and  ancient ruins to hide out in.

 There is  another episode  ""mamba wamba"" where  the zombie  looks  almost  exactly like the one from the  ""which witch is  which"" episode on  season 1.

 This is the point where  ideas were staring to repeat and run a  bit dry and  ""rehashing"" became the  rule.

Some of  these are  really enjoyable like the  ""harum sacrum"" one. Which is genuinly a  bit  creepy. Especially with the  dancing  dog  scene. The  ""high rise hair raiser"" was  another one that was  kind of  creepy  as well. The ""headless horseman""  is also another one that sticks out  instantly. I remember being a  bit  afraid when I was a kid watching this  particular episode.

I enjoyed the  ""Scared  A lot in  Camelot"" and  ""The  Fiesta Host is  Aztec Ghost""  as well.

The ""Watt a Shocking  Ghost"" episode made me  have flashbacks in a good way. It  was  just really good to see a lot of the  monsters that  are referenced in the  muscial intro in their specific episodes from this  collection.

While  initially  I did skip over  the  dynomutt episodes. I  began to  watch a few and to be honest they aren't that  bad,  but  not  as likable as  scooby  obviously. They mostly make me  nostalgic for a  time  I wasn't even  born in.

One super cool  thing was in the  ""hornet epsiode"" (dynomutt)  right in the middle  of them checking  out a  night club, a stage  singer starts  singing  the jabberjaw ( which is another hanna-barbera series that's very  similar to scooby) theme song in full. I found this  a little odd but  enjoyable.

My  only real  complaint is that  the  scooby epsiodes stop at the ""spirits of  '76"", but on  amazon instant streaming list  there are  8 more  you can watch  or  download via amazon instant video.

I found that  really  strange. All I can guess is that  after the dvd  release,  these epsiosdes were found later and  put on the  amazon  media library. I paid  around 24 bucks  for this and I think it was worth it's price. Defintely get this if you are a true blue scooby fan like I am.

P.S. The added features and interviews were a nice touch too.  It was  great to see the  people behind the voices of  these iconic characters.",1332979200,5,2976,4.424184261036468

At first, the Dynomutt episodes were sort of an afterthought, but after watching 4 or 5 of them, I really started to enjoy them. Blue Falcon and Dog Wonder are sort of like Batman and Robin, but much more odd together. Together, they bust crime all over ""Big City."" I think that the original concept for the show was a good one, and kept Saturday mornings balanced. There's a downside to the packaging of this set, however. The 4 discs are basically stacked on one another, which sets the stage for physical damage to the discs, especially if the prongs loosen over time, which is almost inevitable. I don't know why they chose to package the set this way; perhaps it was to save money? Anyway, the set is enjoyable, and well worth the price.

A good laugh is priceless and well needed nowadays.  Even me,being French dig the coolness of this cartoon.

Why also, did they only release 15 of the 24 episodes of the previous series ""The New Scooby Doo Movies"", when they made the set? That's why I didn't buy it.

2461208,3,B000CEXFZQ,"This DVD contains only the 16 episodes from 1976, which some people think of as Season 1 of ""The Scooby Doo Show"". As a Scooby Doo aficianado I can say that this newest installment from Hanna Barbera is a ""good enough"" addition to a Scooby collection.  I think I must have enjoyed the cartoons more as a child; they don't seem to hold up well to repeat viewing now. Arguably, the Scooby/Dynomutt Show was a weak Saturday morning addition, even in my fond recollections, primarily because Dynomutt and Blue Falcon are so fricking annoying. But it is a nice walk down memory lane, and you can skip over the Dynomutt episodes anyways.

For those who are concerned about the ""missing"" 24 episodes from 1977 and 1978, sixteen of them (from 1978) will be released on the up-coming ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You? Series 3"". No word on the 8 episodes from 1977.

I think the confusion is coming in because there were 40 episodes that were generally thought of as falling under the name ""The Scooby Doo Show"", but in fact they were actually broadcast as:

(1) ""Scooby/Dynomutt Hour"" (16 episodes- 1976, plus 16 Dynomutt episodes, as originally televised)  **available**

(2) ""All Star Laff-a-Lympics"" (8 episodes - 1977)  **not released to DVD**

Hanna Barbera knew how to make cartoons with memorable characters that left lasting impressions on generations of children. The Scooby-Doo/ Dynomutt hour is full of laughs for the whole family and still appeals to the kid in all of us. I don't know what kind of restoration went into the 16 episodes, because its clear that the episodes do suffer from age related issues and debris. Overall the picture and sound of this show in DVD format is very good and it's really a treat to add it to my ever expanding Hanna Barbera collection. I am not a fan of the disc packaging, you have to fumble around too much to get the discs in and out and risk scratching them. The other complaint is why the studio chose to put the series on two single sided discs & two double sided discs instead of making it a five disc set. The bonus features included are pretty good and I thought they were interesting. Whether you go for a ride in the Mystery Machine or fly with the Blue Falcon you'll have a blast doing it.

There were actually MORE ""Scooby"" cartoons in this series that this DVD set doesn't have though [:-(] [BIG FROWN]

They were [to name a few]; ""THE CURSE OF VIKING LAKE"" ""THE CREEPY HEAP FROM THE DEEP"" ""THE CHILLER DILLER MOVIE THRILLER"" [the one with ""Scooby-Dee""???] & ""THE CREEPY CRUISE"".

There are more, but you get my point. Why didn't they include these?? [snif!]

I will admit, the ""Blue Falcon & Dog Wonder"" parts were more hilarious than I remembered as a kid!! The scene where Dynomutt meets the ""6 Billion [not 'million'!] Dollar Man"" is a total send-up to 1970s tv!

2461263,4,B000CEXFZQ,"I was thoroughly entertained with this 4-DVD set, basically because Dyn-o-Mutt was a character i had always laughed my you know what off at. His malfunctions coupled with Blue Falcon's seriousness in my opinion are what make the series hilarious. Lots of credit goes to the vocal delivery of Gary Owens who in spite of ridiculous situations his character is put through thanks to ""Dog Wonder"", watching Blue Falcon's slow burn at the malfunctions of Dynomutt and then hearing him call his side-kick ""dog blunder"", etc etc. Well, to me it's funny but my sense of humor is off the wall anyway. Frank Welker voices Dynomutt. On the Scooby side of the collection, i enjoyed the programs...for pure nostalgia reasons if nothing else, Scooby-Dum makes an appearance as well. I enjoyed every episode but some i can watch and re-watch and re-re-watch and never get tired of seeing them, even though i know the mystery. Those episodes include ""The Lighter Than Air Raid"" which features Blue Falcon and Dynomutt pursuing a villain known as The Blimp. ""The Awful Ordeal with The Head of Steel"" is about a villain named Iron Face who goes on an abduction spree of Big City's top officials. ""Everybody Hyde"" deals with Willie the Weasel disguising himself as Mr Hyde to commit crimes. Scooby and the gang guest star on this episode. Another favorite episode is ""Sinister Symphony"" where Blue Falcon must stop evil clones who are hypnotized by a lullaby to commit crimes. ""The Injustice League of America"" deals with the villains of Blue Falcon teaming up to form a plan to defeat the super-hero and Dynomutt. The villains include The Gimmick, Lowbrow, Super Thug, Fish Face, and Queen Hornet. The Scooby episodes that i love are ""Watt a Shocking Ghost"" which tells the story of the 10,000 volt ghost and a blacked-out ski resort. ""The Gruesome Game of the Gator Ghoul"" features the debut of Scooby-Dum and the famous Scooby-Doo/Scooby-Dum hand slap and dance routine. ""The Headless Horseman of Halloween"" features the tale of the Headless Horseman...trivia: the descendant of Icobod Crane is voiced by Janet Waldo of Penelope Pitstop and Judy Jetson fame. Scooby-Dum appears on that episode as well. In ""There's a Demon Shark in the Foggy Dark"", Scooby and the gang unravel the mystery of the shark monster that haunts Aqua-Land. ""The Spirits of '76"" is based on history. Scooby and the gang are at the Smithsonian Institution, and end up being locked in over-night where they stumble onto a mystery involving wet foot prints, which leads them to unravel a mystery leading to a crime being committed by imposters, posing as Benedict Arnold and the like. In ""The Ghost and the Bad Humor Man"", Scooby and the gang stumble onto a mystery revolving around an ice cream factory. On each of the DVD's there contains menu selections of course. However only one disc provides bonus material...DVD #4...on side 2. I also had to search each DVD to find the masterpiece segment, which only runs a little over 7 minutes, giving spotlight to the wonderful voice actors on that cartoon...including what could have been one of Don Messick's last interviews in the early-mid '90s. The clip of Don isn't dated to it's not for certain when he did that...he passed away in 1997 so it's safe to say it was before 1997. Frank Welker shows us his vocal tricks...he portrayed both Fred and Dynomutt in that series...oh, and Casey Kasem is also featured. Anyone with ears can tell Casey is the voice of Shaggy plus a few of the cops and criminals {including Swamp Rat in one of the episodes}. Along with Casey, Don, and Frank there is Nicole Jaffe {Velma} and Heather North {Daphne} and Gary Owens {Blue Falcon}. Gary also narrates a segment in the bonus selections on side 2 of DVD #4 recalling the history of Scooby, which includes appearances from Fred Silverman, Iwao Takamoto, Mark Evanier, and the Ruby-Spears team that created the program. As a whole, and for nostalgia, i give the DVD set 4 stars.

2461265,5,B000CEXFZQ,"This was indeed by far the best DVD package to come out of the WB in some time but I hope that the WB will come out with the other Dynomutt cartoons that were made when Dynomutt got a solo spot. Scooby Doo's 1976 series lacks the original charm of the Where Are you series. Gator Goul and Mumba wamba are 2 of the best ones from that show.

I like the everybody hyde episode where Scooby Teams up with dynomutt and BF to catch the criminal.. I even like the one with Iron face where the people that put Iron Face away are captured and locked up in their own prison... It is up to BF and Dynomutt to save them.

the interviews are FUN... We see the late GREAT Don Messeck and all the cast have a blast recalling their own memories about the series. Hopefully the WB will decide to release the other dynomutt cartoons for the fans that want them..

Shadowman, and the one about beast Woman taking control of Dynomutt are not on the set... I intend to enjoy my set as I am glad to see SOMETHING come out with Dynomutt and Scooby Doo...",1148428800,2,1032,4.15

2461267,4,B000CEXFZQ,"The 1976-1977 Saturday morning TV season saw the premiere of The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour. This show was composed of a half-hour Scooby-Doo episode and a half-hour Dynomutt episode. These were the first new Scooby-Doo episodes produced in 3 years, and the very first episodes ever of Dynomutt. In total, 16 episodes of Scooby-Doo and 16 episodes of Dynomutt were produced for this season. After only 13 airings of The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, the show proved popular enough that it was expanded to 90 minutes and renamed The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show, adding repeats of the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! episodes for the extra half-hour. The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show aired the final 3 new episodes of each, and then repeated all 16 episodes of each for the remainder of the season. This is the ONLY season of The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour/Show, and so, YES, this DVD is complete with all 16 episodes produced for both Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt that aired under that title.

The 1977-1978 Saturday morning TV season saw the premiere of Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics, a 2-hour show composed of the half-hour debut of the Laff-a-Lympics, the half-hour debut of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, plus a half-hour of Scooby-Doo, and a half-hour of Dynomutt. The half-hour of Scooby-Doo aired repeats from The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour/Show, PLUS 8 new episodes. Similarly, the half-hour of Dynomutt aired repeats PLUS 4 new episodes as well. It's these new episodes of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt that aired during Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics this season that some folks refer to as the ""2nd season"".

The 1978-1979 Saturday morning TV season gets even more confusing. 16 more new Scooby-Doo episodes were produced for this season. No new Dynomutt episodes were produced. The first 9 of these new episodes were first aired under the half-hour Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! show, complete with the original show's opening credits, just with new episodes. The remaining 7 new episodes (plus repeats of all 16) aired as part of the renamed Scooby's All-Stars, a 90-minute show composed of new and repeat half-hour episodes of the Laff-a-Lympics, new and repeat half-hour episodes of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, and new and repeat half-hour episodes of Scooby-Doo. It's these 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo that some folks refer to as the ""3rd season"".

Now to add even more confusion, all Scooby-Doo episodes from these past three seasons, 40 episodes in total (16 + 8 + 16), were re-packaged together as The Scooby-Doo Show for syndication reruns. All Dynomutt episodes, 20 in total, were re-packaged together for both network and syndication reruns as Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. So most folks only know these episodes from the syndication repeats airing on cable networks like Cartoon Network, and not from their original airings.

As for the DVD, the GOOD news is that, YES, this DVD is complete with all 16 episodes produced for both Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt that aired under The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour/Show, from the ONLY season that the show aired. The video and audio are both great for a 30-year old show, with the Dynomutt episodes just a bit under par compared to the Scooby episodes. The bonus features are the best of any Scooby-Doo DVD set released thus far, particularly with the interviews with the voice cast: Casey Kasem, Nicole Jaffe, Heather North, etc.

But, there is BAD news and REALLY BAD news. The BAD news is that the 2006 Hanna-Barbera DVD releases so far for this year, for both this DVD set, and for The Flintstones Season 5 DVD set, show the ""cheapening"" in production for the product packaging. Gone are the plastic outer covering transparent slip covers that were on all the 2004 and 2005 Hanna-Barbera animated DVD sets. The DVD discs themselves are now stored two to a page, with one on top of the other, overlaying half of the one underneath it. More likely to scratch one while trying to get to the one below it, especially with the two-sided discs. It does make for a thinner boxed set.

And the REALLY BAD news: I was fully expecting to see The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour episodes as they originally aired back in 1976 when I first watched them on Saturday mornings. That means with the original opening credits with the original Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt theme song, and with the original closing credits. Heck, even the back of the DVD box listed partial lyrics from the original theme song. I was even hoping to see the modified opening credits when the show changed from Hour to Show, which was also noted on the back of the box. Whoever did the text for the back of the DVD box certainly did his homework and knew his stuff. But, boy was I surprised when I watched my first episode, and each episode thereafter. What you get is the opening credits for the syndicated re-packaged The Scooby-Doo Show followed by the Scooby-Doo episode, followed by the closing credits of The Scooby-Doo Show, followed by the opening credits of the re-packaged Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, followed by the Dynomutt episode, followed by the closing credits of Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. This is NOT how these shows originally aired in 1976.

Overall, if you are a fan of either Scooby-Doo or Dynomutt, and want to add these episodes and bonus material to your DVD collection, you will greatly enjoy this collection. However, if you are a completist, and want the episodes as they aired on their original network airing, or want every episode that aired in the re-packaged syndication reruns, you will be disappointed.",1144454400,189,5521,5.020742358078603
2461268,5,B000CEXFZQ,"People don't know what they are talking about. Check the Hanna-Barbera website or any episode guide on the web about this dvd release. In 1976 Hanna-Barbera showed 16 weeks of this Dynomutt Scooby-Doo hour which is COMPLETE here. ALL 16 episodes. The Scooby-Doo show went on the next fall of 1977 for a second season and then a third season in 1978 without Dynomutt. Hanna-Barbera did this dvd release right..They released it EXACTLY as it was shown on Saturday morning television in 1976. To put 24 MORE episodes on this release would have been WAY too many dvd's and LOTS more time to wait while they cleaned up the prints. There are no more than 3 one hour episodes per dvd side which is the HIGHEST quality way. As for the arrangement of the dvd's people they are trying to keep costs down for the consumer. Put up with the case as it is..I'm glad it isn't 2 inches thick!! It's Scooby Doo man!! I am sure seasons 2 and 3 will be the next Scooby set Hanna-Barbera put out since they've gone in order thus far. For the most part to have these Scooby-Doo shows on tape you would have had to tape them off Cartoon Network or Boomerang and the prints they've been showing even the current bi-weekly episodes on Boomerang are VERY dated looking and too dark. When I do a side by side comparison of those eps to the new transfer it is brilliant and crystal sharp!! Warner Brothers did an OUTSTANDING job on the remastering of the prints the colors are gorgeous. A perfect example is the scene with Shaggy's uncle at the start of Scared Alot in Camelot..The one on the Boomerang channel a few weeks ago was too dark, fuzzy and bland. The books on the shelf behind him weren't even visible nor was any of the decor in the room. On the dvd you can even see the title of the book he's reading and all the detailed colors on those bookshelfs behind him!! GORGEOUS transfer. It is a cartoon from 1976 so there are not even enough sound effects to do the whole surround thing with so why do people gripe about that?? The Scooby-Doo show season 1 eps are ALL there and they are GORGEOUS and transferred at the correct frame rate unlike Boomerang and Cartoon netowrk who run them fast to make them under 22 minutes each!! I have to admit that I haven't seen Dynomutt in awhile but me and my 4 year old enjoy the Dynomutt shows too. They are NOT bad. The deadpan humor from Blue Falcon at Dynomutt's constant malfunctions is hilarious and he calls him Dog Blunder!! The Dynomutt's are engaging to this 36 year old and his 4 year old son. Anywhoo the whole Scooby gang even ends up on 4 of the Dynomutt episodes helping them out since they WERE on the hour show together...Do the people who don't even have this dvd set know that??!! Truthfully I only bought this for the Scooby Doo Show season 1 episodes and it is WORTH EVERY CENT for the beautiful work Warner did on these prints but the Dynomutt shows are pretty good as well. Yes they don't look as good as the Scooby ones but why should they?? I am sure the special care wasn't taken with those old originals as with any Scooby film. Scooby Doo is an icon. This aside the Dynomutt episodes look better than anything from the 70's or 80's being shown on Boomerang or Cartoon Network. Scooby Doo fans rejoice!! Go buy this and lets hope Warner doesn't make us wait too long for Seasons 2 and 3!!",1143849600,10,3336,4.382258064516129

8098447,4,B000CEXFZQ,"This is like the the third Scooby Doo incarnation guys. There's 16 episodes approximately 24 minutes long of Scooby and the gang, now joined by cousin Scooby Dum infrequently, solving ghostly mysteries circa 1976. The 2nd half of the episode is 24 minutes of Dynomutt and Blue Falcon. These are like the Adam West/Burt Ward duo. The Scooby Doo gang often joins them to help solve crimes.

So really you get 32 episodes. The back of the DVD cover mentions 3 bonus episodes of another Scooby Doo/Dynomutt hour, but all the episodes on the disc had the same opening from 1976.

The bonus features include a photo gallery of art, interview with Fred Silverman and other creators - abt 13 min., interview with the voice actors abt. 8 min, and 3 cartoon trailers. These are all from 2005 and kindy glossy and fun. They don't go into much depth. But it's fun to see the actors portray the voices as if 30 years hadn't gone by.

Here's hoping we get more Scooby Doo DVDs like the rest of the stuff that hasn't been released and perhaps a box set with everything vintage together. There were lots of shows over a 20 year period, but most were only 13 or 16 episodes long and half hour programs at that.",1511913600,4,1193,4.463302752293578
