3478227,4,B001B18752,"Michael Glawogger is an interesting film documentarian, and this film
from 2005 is perhaps the easiest one of his films to obtain in a
DVD format which plays in North America.  This is about manual laborers
in 4 different settings around the world.  There is only minimal narration
and interviewing; most of the film speaks to the viewer simply by seeing
the scenes and listening to the sounds of the people at work.  Of course
it's not easy work, which is why he found it interesting.
He picked 4 settings, and each one begins with a one-word title.

""Heroes"" depicts a small group of men mining a coal seam in the Ukraine.
Not a big commercial mining operation--no, the seam is too thin to be
viable as a large operation.  They crawl in and out--actually even crawling
is generous; almost the entire time they are inside the mine, they are
wriggling around lying flat, as there isn't even enough room to crawl.
The coal is enough to provide fuel for a few families, and some left over to
sell for food and other necessities.

The second section is called ""Ghosts"" and is about sulfur mining on a semi-dormant
volcano in Indonesia.  Small, wiry men carrying up to 200 lbs of sulfur down slippery,
muddy, razorback foot trails from the upper volcano to a buyer down below.

Section three, ""Lions"", is about a large, open-air butchering operation in Nigeria.
I had to skip this section as it is very graphic depicting animals of various kinds
getting slaughtered and trimmed for sale.

The final section, ""Brothers"", is about men who work at a port in Pakistan, dismantling
old ships to be sold as scrap iron.  Generally, LARGE old ships.  In some ways I found
this last section the most interesting of all, and a suitable conclusion.

Glawogger does not appear to be making any particular political, economic or environmental
statement with his film.  At least, he does not do so overtly, leaving the viewer to
ponder your own opinions on what he has recorded.  I found the film fascinating (skipping
""Lions"" anyhow), and hope I can view his other documentaries as well.",1347235200,6,2070,4.713888888888889

8280938,2,B001B18752,"A friend and I stopped watching ""Workingman's Death"" after the third chapter - the slaughterhouses in Nigeria oddly titled ""Lion.""  It took me a week to find the motivation to return to it and finish watching it, and not because of the nauseating violence of the trussed but bucking cattle having their throats slit time and time again to which the camera repeatedly returns with a voyeur's fascination.  Something very fundamental is missing from Glawogger's documentaries on what his website calls ""the world of work,"" by which it means the world of very hard and demeaning work done from desperation by people with no better choices, but it takes a while to find a way to say what it is.  I had a similar feeling after viewing his film about prostitution, ""Whores' Glory"" - both these films are pricey and were quite a disappointment despite my keen interest in both topics, but why?

Perhaps a start is that I feel almost the opposite of the applauding blurbs that describe his work as ""astonishingly powerful"" or ""daring, novelistic.""  The latter two are especially inapt because there is no narrative - in fact these films are the antithesis of a narrative.  They deliberately tell no story so that watching them is like getting bounced on bus traveling a bad road in a third-world country; and not even that because at least the bus has a destination.

The cinematography is often stunning and sensual, making the people and their deeds fade into the background, but there is no novel, no narrative, and there are no individual actors.  Glawogger is ostensibly non-judgmental of his subjects, but he is also non-judgmental, and decontextualized, about everything else as well.  Imagine making a film about prostitution but being neutral, nondescript and mute about the social ordering that makes it a viable career choice, and about the distortions of values and attitudes that have to be wrought to make it livable.  He has done that.  Glawogger has no sensitivity to his subjects as people, so in ""Bruder"" we find Pashtun laborers dismantling ships we know not where or for what, offering pious bounds of fealty in one frame and posing like fools in the next one-by-one to have their photos taken with a pink-and-black plastic Kalashnikov without Glawogger even raising the question of for whom such photos are being taken, and why they have chosen to pose with a toy automatic assault rifle.  None of his subjects is allowed to show an individual life or persona, none is given the opportunity to raise or pursue moral issues or ideals, and one-by-one the men doing the backbreaking labor are made to seem foolish or incidental, as though they were merely the instruments of the documentary's quest.  An Indonesian man who carts 150-200 pounds of sulfur on his back down a live volcano speaks flatly of his recreation of getting drunk and mixing it up against four to six others at a fight bar - and so?  There is no so of it; he just does that.  Nor is there a point when these men chivvy dollars from tourists taking photos.  Indeed the pastel and flavescent yellow chunks of sulfur bouncing in the balanced straw bins atop the backs of the laborers are filmed as vividly and languorously as the men, and given as much independent life and interest by the film.

All this is not an idiosyncratic quirk of Glawogger, but is part of his illusion that a documentarian can be perfectly objective, and can study a subject without involving the life of his subject.  As though one might make a documentary of faces without reference to the emotions they convey, or the circumstances in which the people whose faces they are find themselves.  And, of course, one can do this, but only by stripping its subject of any meaning or significance, and this is what Glawogger has done.  He has wasted two very good titles on films that illuminate little about the topics they claim to be about.

Having thought and written this, I then found an interview that Glawogger gave about ""Workingman's Death,"" to the Australian Film Commission that can serve mutatis mutandis for ""Whores' Glory.""

[BEGIN QUOTE] One aspect that interested me a great deal ...was the question of how physical labour can be depicted. I also watched various old documentaries and fiction films about workers or their heroism and realized that the work itself was almost never shown. ... Work was interesting only as a way to introduce the worker, who in fact served in the classic worker film as an ideological vehicle. In contrast I've always been interested in making physical labour itself the subject of a film, and by means of this sensual experience determine its social and political position. [END QUOTE]

Here then from the director's own lips is the recipe for his failure.  Once history, morality, psychology, sociology and justice are excluded from consideration, all that is left is a vain illusion that he can segue from his portrayal of the ""sensual experience"" of work to ""determine its social and political position.""  Glawogger has painted himself into a corner, climbed out on a branch and cut it behind him, and then thought that he could be free and fly.  Instead, he flopped, and very badly.",1409097600,,5184,4.835972850678733
8280939,5,B001B18752,"In fact, the last section is about steel workers in China, which is as riveting as the other sections.  The workers depicted in this documentary are so far outside any mainstream about to which many Americans could relate that the stories almost strike one as fiction.  Fantastic photography and scenery, but the most astonishing aspect is the determination, energy and adaptability of the workers themselves.

The cheerfully appealing Russian miners in this film whose stories open this film are in breathtaking contrast to the grim-faced Putin who is steadily in today's headlines.",1398816000,,583,5.315217391304348
