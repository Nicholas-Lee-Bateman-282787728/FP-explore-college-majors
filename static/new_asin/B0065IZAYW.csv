It's great to get classic shows like this finally available on Amazon.com through importers.  I never could get the A(ustralian)BC web store to take my payment.",1409097600,,379,4.081081081081081

8493460,5,B0065IZAYW,"I saw this series years back on our local PBS station and it has stayed with me. But it only comes in a different region, which is not compatible with American DVD players.
So, I purchased a small DVD player that plays different coded DVD's..............I just love this series. It makes you laugh because the Australian humor of John Clarke, Bryan Dawe and Gina Riley is hilarious. They bounce off one another so well, and John Clarke keeps it all running smoothly.
Clarke's sense of humor is incredible to watch because he does it with a straight face...........he is one of the writers, too.

It's just a great series. A real gem.",1340841600,,633,4.651785714285714
