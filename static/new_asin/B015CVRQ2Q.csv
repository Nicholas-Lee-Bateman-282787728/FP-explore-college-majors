8733185,1,B015CVRQ2Q,"Smh in disappointment. I always support indie films. This was horrible.... Movie was described as a crime committed years ago involving missing drugs and folks went to jail, got out and went to get the missing Coke to start a better life. There was missing Coke but that was about it.. The picture quality was poor and the sound quality was sketchy....the fake blood, explosives, gun shots were very distracting...",1458345600,,414,4.928571428571429
8733186,1,B015CVRQ2Q,"I'll give credit where credit is due. Kudos to Mr. Lee for getting redbox distribution. You would think that if you knew that your movie was going to be seen all over the globe; that you'd actually want to make something worth watching. I've seen a lot of low and no budget films, and have enjoyed some, and hated others. This is one of those movies that I hated. The story had some great ideas; but horrible execution. A few of the actors were terrific. The other actors were either really bad, or didn't have enough time and direction to give a good performance. I'd love to see this crew give a film the time that a good film deserves. I don't care if the budget is low, as long as the entertainment level is high. Hate to say it; but I've had farts that were more entertaining than 3 knee deep.
TAKE A PASS ON THIS FILM!",1455840000,3,824,4.2215189873417724
8733187,4,B015CVRQ2Q,"Clearly a low budget film, but as long as you go in expecting that, you will be entertained. First off, it's very funny, with a mix of quirky characters, funny one liners, and what I think is self-aware intentional unintentional comedy. Good action, and plenty of excitement. Sort of a 52 car pileup style story, where you meet a ton of characters, and their stories increasingly intertwine. Violence ensues. Also, several surprisingly good acting performances. One of the best indies I've seen.",1453680000,,495,5.048780487804878
8733188,1,B015CVRQ2Q,"William Lee wrote, directed, starred and hid his face behind his dreadlocks as he shamefully played ""Ghost."" Ghost wants to sell out his 1 ton of ""pure Colombian cocaine"" because Pink Peruvian Flake sounds too 60's which didn't stop Lee from taking a famous line from ""Cool Hand Luke."" Ghost becomes kidnapped and is held on a horse farm while everyone is looking for his stash where hopefully they can find a decent line.

The acting was horrible. Sasha Brown was noticeably unconvincing in her delivery. Lee attempted to have characters, but never developed them. The action wasn't great and neither was the sparse CG blood. The beginning starts out like a bad joke, ""A Jamaican, Asian, and white guy are in a bar..."" The strippers looked rather well fed except for one who most likely wandered onto the wrong set.

Low budget. Good street shots and the sound wasn't bad.

8733189,4,B015CVRQ2Q,"Smashing! Simply the most fun I have had on a movie set. Some things I would change, but overall, a beast of a micro budget film!",1452038400,,129,4.0
8733190,4,B015CVRQ2Q,Good mix of action and humor. Got some real belly laughs out of this one.,1451952000,,73,3.933333333333333
8733191,3,B015CVRQ2Q,My husband's kind of film....a little bit of madness and mayhem and occasional laugh too.  Enjoyed this!,1451779200,,104,5.117647058823529
8733192,4,B015CVRQ2Q,Fun and action packed movie.  Enjoyed watching and glad I picked this one because is not one I would usually watch (Hallmark channel gal).  Will watch again!,1451779200,2,157,4.777777777777778
