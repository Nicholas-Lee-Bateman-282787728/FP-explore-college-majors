Two brothers Jeevandas (Om Prakash) and Shankar (Manmohan Krishna) inherit a substantial area of farmland on their late father Ramswaroop Lal's passing. Jeevandas marries Bhagvanti (Lalita Pawar) but are childless, while Shankar marries Parvati and they have two sons, Govind (Sunil Dutt) and Shyam (Sudhesh Kumar). Govind becomes paralyzed in his right leg due to an accident (electricuted while untying a kite at electric pole).

Shyam leaves to become educated in the city while Govind stays behind to look after the family and farm. Bhagvanti is always taunting Govind (for being paralysed but he doesn't take it seriously) while praising Shyam. Also Govind's mother bring home Radha (Nutan) from another village to help out in house work and give support to Radha since she has no one to look after.

One day Bhagvanti gets a letter from her nephew Navrangi (Pran) that he will be coming to India from Singapore along with his sister Neelima and sidekick Manmauji (Mohan Choti). This is when the trouble starts. Navrangi starts putting fuel to the fire by creating a fight and division among brothers and family with full support from Parvati.

Now Shyam returns from the city and immediately falls in love with Neelima. During this he finds the family split in two by disagreement and bitterness; Jeevandas, Bhagvanti, Shyam, Navrangi, and Neelima on one side, and Govind, his wife, Radha (Nutan), Shankar, and Parvati on the other. Shyam chose to go with Navrangi and Neelima. And all the inheritance is divided into half.

Navrangi loans money from Bhagvanti and invests it in a Carnival, but most of his earnings are stolen by two dancers, Jati and Sati. He then borrows more money, this time from Shyam, to purchase an elephant. Govind and Radha soon celebrate the birth of a completely healthy baby boy, Navjeevandas Lal. Later, Navrangi intends to begin staging a show using the elephant at the carnival where a boy is thrown from the trunk, and he intends using Govind's son. Navrangi abducts Navjeevandas to use in elephant performance. I will leave the end for you all to watch.

Sunil Dutt's one of the finest works. Pran was hilarious yet evil. Check out his Charlie Chaplin get up. Noble performance from the rest of the cast. Songs are great, among the best:

Tumhi mere Mandir, Tumhi meri pooja
Bari dair bhaee nund lala
Kal Chaman tha aaj ek sehra hua

Definately worth keeping in your DVD library.",1258329600,,2485,4.930622009569378
