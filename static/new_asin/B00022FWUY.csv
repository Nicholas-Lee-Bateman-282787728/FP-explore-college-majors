8020539,2,B00022FWUY,"If you want a history of America's transporation ""from horse to horse power"" look elsewhere. America on the Move is about staging a Smithsonian exhibition on American transportation. The details of the exhibition are recounted in exhaustive detail: How a bus was resized to fit the exhibit hall, where a historic car was found, how to display a locomotive. What suffers is the actual history, which is included in brief dibs, dabs and snippets between interviews with curators and designers. We had hoped this would be an informative show on the history of American transportation and it's role in the growth and expansion of the United States. My daughter, a teacher, needs such material for a unit in her social studies class. This DVD has too little for such use, even as short clips. We found the recounting of the mounting of the exhibition very tedious.",1292457600,5,859,4.890410958904109
