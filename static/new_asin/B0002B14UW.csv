2073520,1,B0002B14UW,"Corny to the bone! This movie doesn't even deserve a star, it deserves a rasberry. My sister and I watched it together. She fell asleep halfway through, and after my eyes got extremely heavy and dry, I just turned it off. We are actually the types to laugh at movies that are so dumb, they are funny- stupid humor. But this movie was just dumb to the point where we just got upset. You can find about a half a laugh every 10 to 15 minutes, but that's it. Don't even waste your money on a bootleg, or waste your ATTENTION on a free watching of it.",1092268800,3,546,4.11214953271028
2073521,1,B0002B14UW,Johnson Family Vacation was a extreamly stupid movie. Lil Bow-Wow was horrible and it was very boring. When i first saw it I thought it was a old movie because it was short and the quailty was bad. half the movie was scenes of them in a car that they rented. It was not funny either. Dont watch this.,1091491200,3,300,4.101694915254237
2073522,5,B0002B14UW,"the movie was hillarious! preshel went to go see it on the same day that i did, and we laughed baout it for a week. if you are looking for a good movie that is guarenteed to make you relax, BUY THIS MOVIE NOW! i promise it will have you rollin'.",1090886400,10,245,3.823529411764706
2073523,1,B0002B14UW,"With Solange Knowles and Bow Wow, I had expected something more than a weak and failing attempt at a feel-good family comedy. The movie was just far-fetched and dumb, enough said. There are only three scenes that were worth watching; the cup in the car episode (my little brother did that once...sick), and the Bun World was funny too...actually that's just two but oh, well.
And now the bad points, ah, where to begin. Okay, first of all, the dialogue, plot, and irony of the movie made it corny overall. Since when do people pick up teenage hitchhikers, and since when do people not suspect anything when that hitchhiker panics when trying to have her picture taken, and since when do the people have the hitchhiker spend the night in the same hotel room, and since when do those hitchhikers have hidden baby alligators names Twinkie? And also since when do they throw a whole family, kindergartener and all, in a barred jail cell? And since when do family reunions consist of a talent show? It was this kind of kiddie (well not even, in this case) ironic stuff that made me give this movie one star. Sorry(...), but I had expected more.",1090022400,,1139,4.615763546798029
2073524,2,B0002B14UW,"This film seemed like a waste of Cedric the Entertainer's talent. Seems like he was holding back and granted this was a family movie, there could've been more geniunely funny moments in this film besides the simple slapstick which seemed more annoying than funny. As I was sitting in the movie theater I actually tried to force myself to actually like this film. Cedric doubles as his uncle in the film which I thought was just sloppy. There was a clear effort to make sure that both the characters he was playing weren't in the same shot together. I saw better ""doubling"" in a Van Damme movie (i.e. Double Impact). Vanessa Williams role seemed very subdued, another waste of talent in the film but she really wasn't given much to work with here and neither was Steve Harvey. The sad thing about it is, is that I really like these actors and they are capable of so much more than was presented in this movie. It must've been for the paycheck. How else can one explain their signing onto this bad movie. Okay I will say that the movie is somewhat enjoyable but I was really looking forward to seeing a movie that would basically outdue National Lampoon's Vacation. I was sorely disappointed.",1086912000,2,1190,4.591549295774648
2073525,4,B0002B14UW,"This is one of those movies that can be divided into ""pluses"" and ""minuses"".
The good points:
1) Although Cedric the Entertainer's ""Nate Johnson"" is estranged from wife ""Dorothy"" (Vanessa Williams), the couple has reconciled somewhat to take their kids to the annual family reunion. This provides for one of the few times that a ""nuclear"" black family is represented in film.
2) A killer soundtrack of ""old school"" favorites enhances the on-screen happenings.
3) Location scenes add to the ""realism"" of the family's journey.
4) Native Americans are portrayed as savvy entrepreneurs that ""humor"" the unenlightened tourist.
5) This is not a bad, first-time effort for director Christopher Erkin.
The minuses:
1) Some of the vignettes are derivative of other films of the genre, especially the Chevy Chase movies.
2) Nate's daughter ""Nikki"" (Solange Knowles) perpetuates the stereotype of the oversexed teen nymphet.
3. Bow Wow, definitely not playing against type, is Nate's son, ""D.J."", a wannabe-rapper.
4. Jokes are made at the expense of ""big-boned"" women, continuing the tradition of laughing at FAT folks.
5. A rather disgusting scene involving a bodily function and a drink cup.
Even though, they're evenly separated, the ""strengths"" of the pluses makes this film mildly recommended.",1083888000,5,1288,5.318627450980392
2073526,4,B0002B14UW,I absolutely love this movie. Cedric the Enterainer is a gold mine in this movie. There's laughs galore in this movie. Shannon Elizabeth cameo is a must look at. Don't miss this movie.,1082160000,2,184,4.606060606060606
2073527,4,B0002B14UW,"When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't sure I wanted to see it because it featured a lot of teenage hip-hop artists of the moment (like Bow Wow and Solange Knowles), so I thought it would be teen-oriented (not that there's anything wrong with that). But it actually isn't. And on top of all that, this movie is pretty funny.
Cedric the Entertainer plays Nate Johnson, a man who is trying to drive his son D.J. (Bow Wow), daughters Nikki (Solange Knowles) and Destiny (Gabby Soleil), and (separated) wife Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams) to the annual Johnson Family Reunion in California. But they somehow end up driving all across unnecessary states (they go from New Mexico to Colorado to Kansas to Missouri) while encountering strange situations -- the strangest of which would have to be hitchhiker Chrishelle (Shannon Elizabeth).
The funniest part of the movie to me would have to be when Nate expresses his dismay of D.J.'s CDs, and what Nate in turn does with them. But overall, the movie is great. The only thing I really didn't understand was why Jennifer Freeman had such high billing (she was listed fourth, I think), because she was only in one or two quick scenes, and she didn't even have any speaking parts. But regardless, Johnson Family Vacation is worth checking out at the theater.

2073533,1,B0002B14UW,"a very sad attempt to entertain by ripping off some moments of well known films like national lampoon's vacation and others
even the main actor tried to outperform eddie murphy double roles in john landis' coming to America.
for god's sake. he even smiles just like murphy himself!
this movie is not entertaining at all. as long as you saw many comedies as I did.
obviously so many favorable reviews were done by watchers who never spend big budget to go frequently to the movies!!!

I am sad that as of today, I never saw memorable comedies done by so called ''afrikanamerican'' professional entertainers.",1479772800,,606,4.826923076923077

2073612,2,B0002B14UW,"This is just like a real-life family vacation: Predictably overdone and maddeningly slow paced with brief occasional moments of hilarity. But typically those moments are very few and very far between. Just like this flick.

Martin Short and Dana Carvey have learned the hard way - sidekicks typically cannot carry an entire film by themselves. And Cedric The Entertainer is a sidekick.

Some performers are just destined for supporting roles. And in truth, from an acting perspective, you actually limit oneself and your career by only seeking out, or worse, demanding the lead roles.

Statistically and fiscally, a good sidekick can have a much longer and much richer career. Walter Brennan proved that you can even carve your own niche in Tinseltown if you do your schtick well. I think he went through more than two dozen lead actors. And when most were retired - he kept chugging along. How many paychecks did he cash in when those 'stars' were relegated to a lawn chair and pool side reminiscing about 'back in the day'?

If everything truly is cyclical - I hope this new generation of actors produce ones who realize that getting paid on regular basis and having a thirty-to-forty year career is just as important as getting good bill position on the movie poster.

As a flick - nothing of merit, nothing of note. It's not even worthy of a rainy day rental.",1304294400,,1363,4.782978723404256

Even the on-board navigation system has a meltdown on Nate Johnson and his family's cross-country trek to their annual family reunion/grudge match. Reluctantly along for the ride are Nate's wife, who's only in it for the kids; their rapper-wannabe son; their teenage daughter who's fashioned herself as the next Lolita; and their youngest, whose imaginary dog Nate just can't seem to keep track of. Can the Johnsons survive each other and all the obstacles the road throws at them to make it to Caruthersville, Missouri. I loved this movie...Maybe because I am a huge fan Edric and Steve Harvey. But I actually thought that this movie was very well done. It's not the normal for Edric or Steve but sometimes you have to go a different direction and I think that they picked the right direction. It's a nice movie that you can take your kids, I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1262304000,2,956,4.8

At their worst, they can just be unfocused, meandering wastes of time.  Unfortunately, this movie tended toward the latter.  Instead of transformation we get one-liners and sight gags, and not even enough of those.  Also this movie wasted of fine acting talent, especially, of all people, Shari Headley, whom I fell in love with in the classic ""Coming to America,"" but is relegated to a bit part here.

I LOVED THE PART WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PIMPED OUT AND WHEN NATE AND HIS SON D.J. HAD IT OUT ABOUT THE CDS AND THREW THE CDS OUT OF THE WINDOW. THE MOVIE BECAME MORE AND MORE FUNNY WHEN THE FAMILY WERE AT FUN WORLD AND NATE RAN INTO THE CHEF MAKING DESTINY'S BIRTHDAY CAKE HAHAHAHAHA. I ESPECIALLY LOVED STEVE HARVEY WHEN HE CONSTANTLY TAUNTED HIS BROTHER.

In ""Johnson Family Vacation,"" which is little more than an all-black version of the National Lampoon Vacation movies from twenty or so years ago, Nate Johnson loads his wife and three kids into the car and drives from their home in Los Angeles to a family reunion in Missouri.  Along the way, of course, the family meets with a series of comic misadventures that threaten to prevent them from reaching their destination.

Despite the derivative storyline, the early scenes in the film exhibit a kind of playful spirit that bodes well for the rest of the movie.  This is due in no small measure to Cedric the Entertainer, who, unlike so many of the comics who appear in these types of movies, doesn't feel the need to stand apart from the material in order to draw attention to himself.  Indeed, it is the laid-back, unfussy way in which he delivers his lines that makes them so funny.  He is also blessed with an attractive supporting cast that includes Vanessa Williams as his long-suffering wife and Bow Wow as his mouthy but generally good-hearted teenage son.  The movie even includes some clever little satirical jabs at the accoutrements and symbols of modern-day black culture as Nate, the traditionalist, who listens to `70`s soul on his worn-out 8-tracks, goes toe-to-toe with his adolescent gansta' rap children.

But as the Johnsons tootle their way across country in their souped-up SUV, we begin to notice that the film itself has stalled out.  About halfway through, it dawns on us that the movie isn't really going anywhere, that it is merely playing out variations on incidents we've seen earlier in the film, and that the set pieces and situations aren`t nearly as interesting or outrageous as they should be.  This is truly a pity because, given the attractive cast, we really want to like ""Johnson Family Vacation"" more than we ultimately do.

Still, all things considered, this makes for a reasonable diverting, mindless time at the movies, and Cedric the Entertainer's moniker has rarely seemed so apt.",1139961600,,2030,4.889212827988338

People Take my advice stay away and you might save yourself from this horrible movie(well this doesnt deserve the word movie it suits better when called Cow Crap",1138147200,5,508,4.532608695652174
2073624,5,B0002B14UW,"This is a movie of a middle class African-American family. It shows how competition, distance, support and the urge to stay connected affects the family. This movie also shows how all races have stereotypes of other races and also of different class structures within the race. The story is told in a humorous way including musical selections. The theme of the movie is family is the nucleus of society and can remain strong through any obstacle.

The movie stars Cedric the Entertainer as Nate Johnson who is married to Vanessa Williams. The have two daughters and one son played by Bow Wow. Nate Johnson is a successful insurance company employee living in suburban area of California. His wife is going back to school to become a CPA which has caused them to separate due to Nate's inability to support his wife's dreams. So he moves around the corner from their home.

Steve Harvey plays Mack Johnson, Nate's older brother. He is married with one daughter and one son. He still lives in Caruthersville, Missouri their hometown. Competition between the brothers still is ongoing to gain their mother's affection. The family reunion is coming up and the bragging begins on which of the brothers families will win the ""Family of the Year"" trophy.

Most of the movie is the travel Nate and his family take cross country to get to the family reunion in Missouri. Nate's wife agrees to go because it is the youngest daughter's birthday as well. The youngest daughter has created an imaginary friend to deal with the separation of her parents. This is how she is dealing with loss, loss of the family structure.

Stereotypes that are portrayed by Nate are his view of rappers that their lifestyle is a waste of time. This is the dream his son has to become a rapper. Also, he thinks Native Americans should be or dress in cultural attire. Society and Nate's perception that a beautiful woman is skinny and that woman should be happy just being a wife and mother. All of his stereotypes change by the end of the movie. Nate and his wife reconciled, the brothers came together, and the daughter no longer needed her imaginary friend all because the family structure survived and still loved each other.",1133740800,,2197,4.758530183727034

When they get tho the reunion, it gets a little stupid. Besides the reunion i give it a 4 but the reunion part was wierd.

2073630,4,B0002B14UW,"Meet the new generation's vacationing family as they travel from California to Missouri and encounter all sorts of silly experiences along the way.

Nate Johnson (played by Cedric the Entertainer) begins his family vacation by picking up his SUV from the dealer and finding out he now has a ""hip-hop mobile"" complete with hydraulics and rapper wheels. His son, (Lil' Bow Wow), now of course thinks of his dad as cool. Estranged from his wife (Vanessa Williams), Nate has convinced her to take a ride to his family reunion along with his teenage boy-crazy daughter (Solange Knowles) and his youngest child (Gabby Soleil). All kinds of funny things happen along the road and family issues begin to come to a head. The reunion is hilarious with Nate and his brother (Steve Harvey) competing for their mother's attention....let the competitions begin!

Cedric the Entertainer is very funny in his role as the nerdy insurance selling dad; he is a gifted performer and has the chance to show off all his stuff in this role. Vanessa Williams is still beautiful and amazingly good as the serious Johnson mom. Lil Bow Wow shows he is not all hip-hop in his role as the Johnson son. Solange Knowles is perfectly cast as the teenage Johnson daughter with an eye for the boys. And how sweet is little Gabby Soleil as the youngest Johnson. Of course Steve Harvey cannot be denied as the competitive Johnson brother. The best part of this movie is the talent contest at the reunion where we get to see Cedric in all his glory and Harvey doing a ""Miss Jackson"" routine! This movie is light-hearted and entertaining for the whole family with a heartwarming ending of course so sit back and let the Johnson's do the driving.",1098403200,14,1707,4.744107744107744
2073631,2,B0002B14UW,"I am a huge fan of Cedric and Steve Harvey, so this movie was a disappointment because in my opinion, their talents are dampened.  I laughed exactly three times, and even those were half-hearted laughs.  I'm thinking perhaps this was not intended for adults...I suppose kids would find the situations funny, but both Cedric and Steve seemed like they were wearing muzzles on their brains.

If you liked the Lampoon vacations with Chevy Chase, you'll probably mildly enjoy this. But if you're looking for something more similar to humor and creativity of  The Steve Harvey Show or Cedric the Entertainer Presents, look elsewhere.",1096416000,3,628,5.067961165048544

Cedric is capable of way better material than this.  I just couldn't finish this movie it was horrible.  Like another flick i seen a couple months back ""My baby's Daddy"" with Eddie Griffin.  Who's bright idea was that?  I'm sick of these new black films with their overplayed stereotypes.  ITS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE",1095724800,3,486,4.7023809523809526
2073633,2,B0002B14UW,"Johnson Family Vacation is an unusual type of movie..the humor-free comedy. No kidding. The movie is just almost completely devoid of anything funny. Cedric has been funny in other contexts but in this film he is unbelievably bland and restrained. Vanessa Williams is good looking and may even be a good actress but she has the comic skills and timing of a brick.

There are some scenes in the film that could possibly have been funny with different actors, writers, and directors, but every attempt at humor in this movie falls flat on its ass. There is no chemistry whatsoever between Williams and Cedric and when Vanessa is trying to act seductively toward Cedric it is just cringe-inducing. Finally, there are so many scenes and ideas ripped off from other movies, especially National Lampoon's Vacation (with Chevy Chase) that it is embarrassing and reminds you how good that movie was and how utterly, deadly dull and stillborn this one is. It got two stars from me instead of the minimum because my kids liked it when Bow Wow rapped. Otherwise the whole thing just stunk. Avoid it.",1093478400,3,1088,4.818181818181818
