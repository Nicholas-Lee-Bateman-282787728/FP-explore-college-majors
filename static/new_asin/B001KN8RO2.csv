8315472,4,B001KN8RO2,"I am not Korean and I am not a good cook or chef.  At first I was put off by the two main female characters and the soap opera constraints and pacing but I still felt compelled to watch it nonetheless.

Near the end, I felt a doubling kind of thinking... I no longer cared what happened (as I found the basic realization of what I had thought was going to go down did go down) but I found myself buying into the small intimate universe of what these actors wanted to share to me/us. I knew they had become the characters.  And all the movie shots had PURPOSE and quickly moved the story. I *traveled* around a country I will most likely not visit.

It is a travel film and a cooking film.  And a soap opera.

I liked it a lot!",1380931200,,726,4.041958041958042
8315473,5,B001KN8RO2,"I have watched both seasons from NetFlix and it has confirmed for me that this is a korean drama series I must purchase! I adore this series! It is not a typical Korean Drama. Its actually fast paced! ^_^
There arefamily secrets, cook offs, brotherhood, and two women in love with the often misunderstood wayward son, main character: Sung-Chan. I love Sung-Chan, he was cute and sweet and naive. A very loving, very loyal young man. Grand Chef Oh is his Adopted father and the two of them are like peas in a pod, creating jealousy in Sung-Chan's older brother and the blood son of Grand Chef Oh.
It is a fantastic and sweet story I can't wait to bringit home and add it to my beloved collection of Korean Dvds",1243900800,5,709,4.419847328244275
