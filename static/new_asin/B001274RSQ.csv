8244340,5,B001274RSQ,"I have been studying, collecting and acquiring books, DVDs, and even PC games pertaining to the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress for the last 3 months or so and I discovered at Amazon this Roaring Glory Warbirds edition dedicated to this iconic, World War Two bomber!  I had to purchase this and add it to my collection!  I have many of the other Roaring Glory Warbirds DVDs on various WWII fighters (my favorite being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roaring-Glory-Warbirds-Vol-3-Vought-F4U-Corsair/dp/B00000FBP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roaring Glory Warbirds, Vol. 3: Vought F4U Corsair</a>)  and previously obtained through Amazon the edition dedicated to the TBM Avenger divebomber&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roaring-Glory-Warbirds-Vol-4-Grumman-TBM-Avenger/dp/B00000FBP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roaring Glory Warbirds, Vol. 4: Grumman TBM Avenger</a>.
This video, like others in the series, lets the viewer get up close and personal with the aircraft; you see it prepare for flight, start it's engines, taxi down the airstrip, takeoff, fly and land.  There is a reenactment by a bomber crew that helps to ""flesh out"" the Flying Fortress experience and archival film footage (Memphis Belle's story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Memphis-Belle-1944/dp/B002V6TQLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Memphis Belle (1944)</a>) is utilized.  Other DVD features include a printable color Photo Album Slideshow (the B-17 named ""Fuddy Duddy"" with the ""crew"" in flight over Geneseo, New York countryside) and a Fact sheet covering the History, Specs, Engine, Details and Armament. I enjoyed this DVD, I found it to be informative, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in WWII bombers.  I have a Listmania List devoted to the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress that you can access here at Amazon to see other great resources!  The movie ""Memphis Belle"" uses actual B-17s.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memphis-Belle/dp/B00597A6NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memphis Belle</a>",1344470400,,2156,7.022388059701493
