I was really disappointed being he is my favorite serial killer. I figured it would being it is so long but, it doesn't. Also, the last DVD is from another serial killer documentary I bought some years ago. It is not the entire documentary because like I said it doesn't talk about Dahmer at all.. I feel like I got ripped off buying this and if I had known it didn't feature Dahmer I wouldn't have wasted my money.. But, other than that it's pretty good.. If your not a fan of Dahmer you might like it..",1463356800,7,672,4.2578125
