2409550,5,B000BB154I,Good story that has a good but sad ending. But the law is the law. However if she was white would it been different?,1354752000,,116,3.875
2409551,5,B000BB154I,"I am sitting here extremely overwhelmed right now after watching the documentary  ""The Execution of Wanda Jean"". For those who have never heard or seen it, this is a real life look at how race, sexuality, and mental health are still playing a role in the American justice system . We are introduced to Wanda Jean Allen, an African-American lesbian whose low IQ bordered retardation, who was on death row for murdering her live-in partner Gloria Leathers.

I am so conflicted about this film... this case... this woman... that I am almost at a loss for words. She shot and killed her partner who was leaving her. She had shot and killed another woman who tried to leave before. My black and white mind is telling me that she should die. But once you see the story unfold  you feel your emotions go on a roller coaster ride that still shakes you up well after it is over.

Even though I watched the film already knowing that she was executed 10 years ago, I couldn't help but have a perverted sense of faith that she would survive. A pit in my stomach began growing when I reminded myself that she wouldn't.

2409552,5,B000BB154I,"THE EXECUTION OF WANDA JEAN is well-made and worth seeing. Clearly the filmmaker had no agenda or axe to grind. All sides are fairly presented; viewers aren't led or told what to think, and that's admirable.

Capital punishment is one of those polarizing topics that few have no opinion on. Since others here have expressed their views, so will I.

I believe in the death penalty and that ""an eye for an eye"" is an instruction to men and not the province solely of the Almighty. I also believe in ""Instant Karma,"" meaning the wrongs a person does in THIS life will be paid for in THIS life, and sooner than one would imagine. In the case of Miss Allen, that karma took over a decade but it finally got her, and justifiably.

A deciding factor to my mind that Wanda Jean Allen earned an execution day is the overwhelming evidence of premeditation. Besides a similar prior murder, a greeting card that Wanda gave the victim contained in her own hand, ""If you try to leave me, I'll kill you."" It matters not if this is the threat of a genius or someone with just enough intelligence to hold down a medical-related job, as was the case with Miss Allen. Her prediction became tragic reality after a chase that ended at a police station parking lot. Gloria Leathers was sent to an early grave by a point-blank bullet to the belly, and Wanda Jean's fate was sealed by her own hand.",1261872000,4,1374,4.46613545816733
2409553,5,B000BB154I,"I won't go into the details of this incredibly engrossing documentary but I did want to express my own kudos. This was certainly a film I just could not take my eyes off of, and though the mere thought of developing an affection and sympathy towards a confessed killer may incense some (as it should)there does come a time (If You are truly a Believer in God) when forgiveness must win out. As engaging as it is, this is not the type of film you will pull out regularly to watch again and again. But at the same time You will be glad it is in your collection. For documentary film making this is a true masterpiece. I believe Wanda Jean came to terms with God, and developed immoveable and deep Faith. I also believe that her mental state should have spared her life. But if there is a positive to be found it is that, through the tragic circumstances she found herself in that led to her earthly demise, she may have found eternal life.",1208995200,8,937,4.329545454545454
2409554,5,B000BB154I,"Like the other viewer, I watched this with a heavy heart. It's sad....it's so sad. It is a documentary, and you can see how Wanda Jeans lawyers tried her case to the end. My heart goes out to the victim the their family, because I don't believe anyone deserves to die at the hands of another human being. This includes Gloria, as well as the judicial system for injecting Wanda Jean with a fatal cocktail.

It's crazy, how someone can be sentenced to death for murder in the 1st degree, or premeditated murder......but isn't the death penalty premeditated murder? Death Row inmates know down to the hour when they will die. I do not support the Death Penalty. The families of the victims still hurt. The victim is still gone. And after the inmate is put to sleep right before that fatal moment, they feel no pain and no remorse. Their suffering is over. They don't have to remember their victims.

I can remember a story where a young man killed someone's daughter by accident. The family took out a judgment to request that he send 1.00 to the family every week until the girl's would have been 18th birthday. That was not about the money.....it was about making that young man REMEMBER this young girl. That hurts more than taking a life away...making you constantly remember a life that YOU took away.

I believe in GOD. That is the problem with the government, is that they try to play GOD. At the end of the day, GOD is not going to look at their action any different then HE would Wanda Jean Allen......She murdered someone, and so did the person that put the needle in her vein.",1194825600,5,1585,4.496527777777778
2409555,5,B000BB154I,"This documentary is was well put together using all original characters and the original seen during each time frame.  It was very sad; yet, educational.  It reveals the controversial over lesbian relationships as well as racial capitol punishment.  I found this documentary interesting because I am anti-capitol punishment because I believe that rather a person should die or not should be a decision made by God and not by man.  Executing someone for murder will not justify judgment if it's an act of will.  Besides, executing someone for murder does not bring the victim back and it doesn't always bring closure to the victim family if the executioner is given an easy death by lethal injection when their loved one died a whole lot worst.  I believe that dying is too easy anyhow for convicted murderers; therefore, they need to suffer in prison for life for what they did.

Wanda Jean Allen is no different from other murderers in God's eye, but she was diagnosed with having a mental condition, she did apologize and confess to her Lord and the victims family for her negligence and only wanted her sentence commuted to life in prison.  If Charles Manson can have his sentence commuted from death to life in prison for all the victims he murdered, why can't Wanda Jean Allen and other African American death row inmates have their life spared?

Lets not forget the victims who also loss their lives as a result of Wanda's negligence, but even the victims family don't believe in an ""eye for and eye,"" and did not support the decision for Wands Jean Allen to be sentence to death, so where was the justice in all of this?  If the wages of sin equals death, then death will come to them instead of them going to the death chamber.",1134432000,13,1735,4.659016393442623

8084048,5,B000BB154I,"Yes, Wanda Jean Allen committed a terrible crime. There is no question about that. But Wanda Jean Allen should not have been executed by the state of Oklahoma under any circumstances. Her defense attorneys presented convincing evidence that Wanda suffered significant mental impairments which decreased her cognitive abilities to understand the consequences of her actions. They presented psychiatric evidence which backed up their claim. State prosecutors also lied at the clemency hearing and got away with it. After the hearing was concluded, the Camera man caught site of the clemency board members congratulating each other on their decision and the board members were acting like they had just scored a touchdown at a football game. This execution should never have been carried out. I believe in the death penalty but this woman should not have been executed.",1465257600,2,866,5.328467153284672
