2791803,4,B000O77M0A,"This show is scary and should not be watched by anyone expecting a light, fluffy tale like the art on the box set.  Bishoujo/moe character designs but otherwise a tragic, divergent, cyclic plot.  Filled with mystery, tension, blood, extreme violence; occasionally interspersed with periods of lighthearted, typical teenage drama.  What is real, what is imagined, what relationship (if any) exists between the seemingly cyclic plotlines; hopefully all these questions will be answered by the end of the series (have only watched the first disc).",1190764800,,544,5.4523809523809526
2791804,5,B000O77M0A,"This series is awesome. the only downfall I have about this DVD is the English dubs are terrible except maybe Rena's from time to time. But the DVD does come with the Jap. and English subs, so it's not that bad. I can't wait for the rest of the season to come out on DVD.",1189814400,,271,3.9454545454545453
2791805,5,B000O77M0A,"So it is little wonder why they were used for the title. This series is dark, disturbing and at times you feel just as hopeless as the characters you're watching.

This series is superb, and unlike most works in the mystery genera has excellent value as a re-watch. I started the show just as it was finishing it's run in Japan, which was rather fortunate for me simply because I watched the entire thing in about three days.

I honestly feel if Suzumia Haruhi no Yuutsu hadn't been airing at the same time this would have been the hit of the season. That's really saying something for a series that only had a budget of $500 per episode",1187568000,,637,4.389830508474576
2791806,5,B000O77M0A,"although the collector's box for this show may look very cutsey and nice, this is a darker anime and does not deserve to be immediatly dissmissed.  I have seen the full anime in japaneese already and the only one i could possibly like more is Elfen Lied.  Though there are some greusome scenes, this is not a horror anime by any meaans.  It may psych the viewer out a little bit, but it shouldn't give anyone nightmares.
  it was said earlier that the 180 from episode 4 to 5 was disliked, and the setup was nothing more than a cheap gimmick to recycle story.  I can say, having witnessed the whole story that it is nothing like that, all of the episodes are completely different.  As odd as it sounds, the best way to look at the plot is just like an onion, each time the story ""resets"", more layers of the onion are peeled of and the viewer gets closer to the answer of the riddle that is Hinamizawa.
  I have also read that this is an emo show.  For those people who knoiws what that means, this is completley untrue.  I am generally a very happy person and love to laugh, this show is not necessarily for depressed people.
  Bottom line, I wouldn't buy the special edition box because the art isn't that particularly great and nothing else comes with it, but this is a very good show and well worth the money",1184544000,,1312,4.3061224489795915

2791808,4,B000O77M0A,"In June 1983 a young teen named Keiichi arrives in the sleepy village of Hinamizawa and quickly becomes friends with a clique of four girls named Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika. They are all cute and seemingly innocent until Keiichi begins to hear stories about the annual Cotton-Drifting Festival. There is nothing sinister about the ceremony itself, but for the past couple of years, the festival has been accompanied by mysterious deaths, murders, and disapperances. The locals believe it to be the work of the village's god, Oyashiro. All the weird stuff started happening several years ago when the government decided to build a dam near the village that would have completely submerged it under water. The villagers revolted and even killed and dismembered one of the construction workers. Work was halted and the plans for the dam abandoned. But it is thought that Oyashiro is still wreaking its revenge against those connected to the project. A cop in a nearby city thinks that the girls surrounding Keiichi are somehow involved in all the strange happenings. Keiichi wants to find out the truth, but could it lead to his own death?

When They Cry is certainly an interesting and unique anime, but that doesn't neccessarily mean it's good as well. The first four episodes work well, proceeding from low-brow humor to unsettling creepiness and horror that could have worked as a one-shot series on its own. It's genuinely scary to see these cute anime girl's irises turn into snake-like slits as they seem to be possessed by a demon or god and turn Keiichi's world upside down. If anything, those first four shows reminded me of the descent into madness style of Edgar Allan Poe. The issue I had was with Episode 5, which seems to start the show over from the point of view of Mion, one of the girls around Keiichi. Apparently, that's how this show is laid out. It tells the same tale from six different points of view. I am not a fan of this type of story at all. It seems cheap and gimmicky and allows animation and plot to be recycled endlessly. In fact it seems to me to be a benchmark of shows with low budgets or low imagination and wreaks of lazy storytelling. I put it right up there with the ""lost memory"" cliche or the ""Start at the end and flashback"" techniques. I don't know how many times I can tolerate starting over from the beginning in a 26 episode show. If the show is set up like this then each arc should be on a seperate disc. They should have put episode 5 on the next volume instead of doing a 180 at the end of Volume 1. Worth a look.",1182384000,4,2563,4.559652928416486
2791809,5,B000O77M0A,"When They Cry is an anime that encompasses almost every facet possible. It starts off relatively cutesy but will slowly twist and decend into a violent sadistic world. All the while the tension is interjected with the return of cute moments. While at first it may sound like it jumps between different angles in some odd sort of plot just thrown together, it actually just heightens the tension within the viewer because it becomes hard to tell what is real.

The story revolves around a young man who has just moved to a new town and befriends a group of girls at his new school. He is somewhat forced to join their club in which they play games after classes to kill time. The loser must be humiliated (for instance he loses and they draw on his face with a marker to look like a cat). Slowly things turn a bit strange as stories begin to surface of the towns history. A history filled with murder, demons, deceit, and mystery. Who's involved? Who's safe? Who will be the next to die? The story keeps twisting and turning throughout.

Originally called ""Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni"" which translates more directly to ""When the Cicadas Cry"" the show is laid out in episode groups. Five or six episodes combine for one plotline and then the next set starts. Some new groups fill in gaps, others provide different angles or possibilities. It's up for a lot of interpretation. This is probably because the show is based off of a Korean Computer Game that was released episodically. As a result, the show reflects that in its presentation. But the art is beautiful, the story is ensnaring, and at 26 episodes long, I can't recommend it more. I rank it up in my top animes with Wolf's Rain, Hellsing, and Azumanga Daioh (yes I know it seems out of place but they are all similar to this show in a way). Stop reading now and start watching. You won't regret it.",1181865600,7,1854,4.5148809523809526
2791810,5,B000O77M0A,"This is a very eye catching anime because it has colorful characters, cute lolis, and disturbing violence.  At the beginning of the series you'll feel that you're watching a harem comedy, you know the lucky guy that spends time with his girlfriends at school, they make fun of him he makes fun them you get the picture.  In the second episode you'll see a 180 change from comedy to the chilling mystery of the gruesome deaths in the village caused by unknown forces at the Cotton Drifting Festival.  From here Keiichi our ""lucky"" guy is threatened and disturbed by his classmates, like when they delivered food for him just make this cruel prank involving needles.

I don't want to spoil too much but I'll say that this series can be compare to TALES FROM THE CRYPT (the series), at the beginning there is comedy, the middle has the involving plot and the ending has that disturbing twist.  You'll understand why when you see episode 5.

The plot was very intriguing it was like watching Phone Booth, Enemy of the State or Taxi Driver for the first time.

Yes there are few scenes of violence but the series is more suspense than horror.

If you like Elfen Lied or Gantz then this is must have for your collection.",1181606400,3,1214,4.56221198156682

The episodes play out in different arcs, revealing parts of the mystery as well as raising more questions, making it a very interesting show to watch and the story's well-crafted, indeed, but when I saw the cute pink box with the lolis, I felt I had to warn people who may not know much about the series that this is hardcore.",1179532800,26,639,4.423728813559322

However, they take place at the same time. The first disc has 5 ep. on it. The first 4 are to one arc. The last ep. would start back like the first and has a different situation.

2791843,4,B000O77M0A,"First, it must be said that this series is not for the faint of heart. The brutality of many scenes definitely ranks this series up there with the Hostel and Saw franchises, only to me some of the sequences were even more disturbing because they're being done by children to children. Seriously, examine your constitution before watching this show.

With that out of the way, When They Cry (Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, lit. ""When the Cicadas Cry"") is a series about a group of girls, their new male friend who has just moved in from out of town, and all the quaint, yet potentially disturbing things going on in the small town of Hinamizawa. I won't spoil any plot details aside from that, because this is a mystery anime that revels in leaving the audience in the dark and reveals very little at a time, but that's what brings my one major criticism of this product, not the show. ""When They Cry"" is only one half of the whole story. In fact, most of the answers to the incurably befuddling questions are not given until the sequel series, Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai, which has NOT been localized to the US (Region 1). That means if you buy this and then want the rest of the story, you'll have to try and find a fan sub, since Japanese discs fall under Region 2 encoding and will not work on your average American device. The reason I emphasize this fact so strongly is that I had to go searching for this information and only found it after When They Cry's last episode had rolled credits and I had paid for what I thought was an entire series. There should be a disclaimer somewhere that denotes that this is NOT a complete story, but is only part one of the Higurashi story, so that anyone completely unaware will not be caught looking when they believe that they are purchasing a complete show.

Aside from that, I read a review of this show that said something close to ""It is a brilliantly executed, painfully beautiful show, full of poignant moments, and wonderful characters, if you can stomach the brutality"". I don't know if I'd give it praise that high, but it was a very good show. And as long as you know you're only getting half a show, feel free to check it out...if you're man enough that is.

2791856,5,B000O77M0A,"This series is a psychological mystery-murder series based in the early eighties.

It's about 3 girls, and 1 boy, who live in a small town in Japan. This town has some rather dark secrets.

You're supposed to find out what's truth,and what's just delusions, or false. However, it's easier said then done, since this is an adaptation of a sound novel series and lacks a lot of the original content. However, it's still great.

This is a great dub, but you can change it to the japanese version with subtitles if you want.

I sort of dislike this arc, due to future arc reasons, but it's still a great arc.

Keiichi, the protagonist, is a 16 year old boy. The ""villians"" in this arc are a 15 year old girl, Rena, and a 17 year old girl, Mion, who are his best friends, and love interests. There are two 9 year olds, but they don't really do anything in this arc.",1248739200,,860,4.316770186335404
2791857,5,B000O77M0A,"After some constant prodding from some influential and demanding sources, I picked up this first volume of When They Cry.  I was blown away!  Amazingly creepy anime horror, no doubt.  It entails youth, friendship, tension, murder, mystery, betrayal--this initially has all the elements to be quite animeazing.  At least that was my reaction to the first 4 parts of volume 1.  A must see for anime fans.

But a word of warning--the series takes a bewildering step next.  I was confused and irritated by part 1 vol. 2.  It almost seems like a prequel, except the kids actually appear older.  Hmmm, this might be brilliant, but it could be retarded.  I plan to watch more, and I imagine it will all play out fine.  At least I hope.

2791858,5,B000O77M0A,"""When They Cry"" is an anime adapted from a popular series of Japanese murder-mystery video games.  And how do video game adaptations usually fare, class?  Well, if this first volume is any indication, consider the curse shattered.  The first 5 episodes of this anime are fabulous and the story is being told in amazingly bold form.  It closely resembles both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man/dp/B000JVT1U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>&nbsp;in tone and themes, but adds that brand of cloying cuteness that can only be found in anime which only manages to accentuate the disturbing content.  This is a series I absolutely cannot wait to see more of.  Makes me glad that there are already six volumes out.

Keichi is a transfer student making friends at his new school in the village of Hinamizawa.  he's already found his way into a club of energetic girls who play games and enact embarrassing punishments on the loser. It's adorable. But the village has secrets.  Lots of 'em.  And nearly as many endearing characters to go with those buried secrets.  Each year, they hold a festival.  Each year somebody dies on that night and another disappears altogether.  Nobody talks about it.  It is simply dismissed as the curse of the village's guardian deity and those who vanish are referred to as having been ""spirited away by the demon"".  The more Keichi learns, the more frightening this anime becomes.  Who are his new friends and why have they been connected to every single victim?  ""When They Cry"" is a tale of paranoia, secrets & lies (gotta have those), mystery, and suspense so thick that a cherubic anime girl could cut with a very large cleaver. And that's just the first arc of a story that will be retold in many different ways. Hopefully, it can maintain some of the freshness and genius of this first arc.

What sets this apart from any other murder-mystery I've seen is that we see the ending (one of many more to come) at the finish of the first four episodes.  After that, time is rewound and we are taken back to the beginning to see a different sequence of events and fall in love with the characters all over again in spite of knowing (part of) the horrible truth.  The cast bugged me for the first 10 minutes or so with their cutesy character designs and cliche anime mannerisms, but by the end of the first episode, I was hooked.  And it wasn't just the people clawing their own throats open.  It's the fright of seeing a typically darling girl for this medium turn into a menacing  entity for just a second before switching back to her saccharine self.  Or the way their pupils narrow cat-like into slits as they innocently (or maybe not) point out similarities between Keichi and the last student to ""transfer"" away from the school without a trace.  The first climax in episode four will drop you jaw, guaranteed.  But by the end of the very next twenty minutes, all will be forgiven and you will again be wrapped up in the sweetness of the same characters whose lives you just saw end horrifically.

This is as good a first volume as I've ever seen for an anime series.  I will be gobbling up the rest as soon as i can get my hands on them.  Anybody looking for a new kind of animated horror, this should be your next stop.",1231891200,5,3479,5.001739130434783
2791859,5,B000O77M0A,"""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" or as it has apparently been incorrectly translated into ""When they cry"" (it should have been ""When the Cicadas Cry"").  Is a grade A anime, for those of you who enjoy long drawn out stories that keep a central mystery hidden from the viewer until the end of the series (around 50 episodes or so).  In that way the series is sort of like ""Lost"" except far, far, far more violent and disturbing.  Though unlike ""Lost"" this anime does have an ending with an actual answer.

So if you can handle a long drawn out show and have the stomach for some truly brutal violence directed at children or children directed at other children or children directed at adults then by all means get this anime.  Not to make it sound like that happens in every scene, most of the show is dedicated towards the relationships between the characters, progress towards figuring out what is going on and usually a problem for that story arc that confronts them, that at least in beginning usually ends badly.

If you're wondering what a Cicadas is.  It's an insect that can make a loud buzzing sound.  You hear it a lot in this anime and others as the insect enjoys warm tropical weather.  So as you can see the title doesn't exactly mean cry, as in I'm sad, it also means cry like a baby kitten's cry for its mother.  Get it, cry = sound.  The whole title is a round about way of saying summer time, which is what the characters of this anime find themselves reliving over and over.",1230940800,2,1485,4.402930402930403
2791860,5,B000O77M0A,"Higurashi is my favorite anime series. But, I thought I'd say, if you want to enjoy this show, DO. NOT. judge it by the first DVD, or even the first few DVDs. Why? Because it starts out horrific, but this is really not a horror anime. Sure, it's disturbing and scary, but if you watch the show all the way through, it's really... more of a drama that has a little bit of every genre.

This is really a show that's confusing, but once you watch it all the way through and understand it, it's really amazing. Beautiful (and original) plot, well-developed and likable characters, a little bit of each genre, emotional, good themes... And then there's the matter of artwork and music and such. I love the music, the artwork's okay, but the second season artwork is just beatiful.

So about this DVD. This has Onikakushi-hen (Spirited Away by the Demon Chapter) and the first episode of Watanagashi-hen (Cotton Drifting Chapter). While Onikakushi-hen seems to work as a story already, it's really just an introduction. It sets up the main mysteries of the show and foreshadows later arcs. The answer arc to this is Tsumihoboroshi-hen (Atonement Chapter), which solves a lot of the mysteries and reveals the actual theme of the arc (the theme continues throughout the story). Watanagashi-hen shows a little more character development later on (ie ""Give me back Mion, my best friend in the world!""), it's definitely not what it seems. (Once again, it's completely different after seeing its answer counterpart, ""Meakishi-hen"", or Eye Opening Chapter.)

The voices in the Japanese version are perfect, while the English dub has a few good voices, but not the best acting. Still, better than most English dubs.

Overall, even if this DVD doesn't have any of the things I like most about the series, it's still really great.

2791861,5,B000O77M0A,"Higurashi is a lengthy and shocking. Yet, the sadistic (but cute) characters really make this anime hilarious. Yes, there is plenty of killing, but I really enjoyed watching the out-of-place cute youngsters turn into cold-blooded murderers for the most insanely unbelievable reasons.

Meiichi Maebara, a teenage boy, lives in Hinamizawa, a peaceful rural village. He plays and has fun with his friends, all girls. However, he quickly learns that Hinamizawa is a cursed town, in which every year at the Watanagashi Festival at least one person dies.

To make matters worse, his friends are trying to hide the truth from him--that they could have killed those people. Rena keeps creeping up to Maebara with a huge knife, the doctors inject him with needles, and people are dying left and right.

And yet, after Maebara commits suicide by stabbing his throat with his fingernails, the characters come back to life...
Well, not really.

Higurashi no naku koro ni (When They Cry) is actually based on a drama video game. There are many different chapters with different takes on the same story. For the first four chapters, lots of people die, and there is no happy ending. The next four chapters, however, give the reasons for the deaths. And yes, there is a happy ending in the last chapter.

However, this is a surprisingly complex soap opera, involving children who are abused by their aunts and uncles, kill others because they are in love and get possessed by ogre spirits. Yes, maybe this story is a little too unbelievable, but the murderers' motives are so bizarre and strange that the series actually turns into a comedy. The alternative plots are very intriguing, each one revealing another piece to the fascinating plot which involves drugs, UFO crashes and, yes, bioterrorism (don't ask).

This series is crazy, bloody and definitely not for kids. However, its storytelling is very gutsy, original and hilarious. There's nothing better than watching little kids kill each other for the stupidest reasons in a crazy town filled with conspiracies. I highly recommend this.",1224806400,16,2078,5.043731778425656
2791862,4,B000O77M0A,"In order to satisfy my inner eBay bargain hunger, I picked up Vol. 1, 2 and the art box of When They Cry on eBay.co.uk. Not bad for a total of 13.50!

Before actually getting into reviewing the anime, I'd like to talk about the When They Cry art box Geneon (RIP) released. The art box is pink, with images of the 5 main female characters (Mion, Rena, Rika, Satoko and Shion) in maid outfits, all looking either cute or sexy. I'm not sure what the people who designed the box art and picked the colour were on; the art box would give someone ignorant about the series the wrong impression of the show. No sane male would be seen walking out of a shop with it... Can you imagine how embarrassing it would be to pay for something that looks like animated child porn?

Thankfully, the reversible DVD covers had someone with a brain design them. One side of the DVD covers is a good (happyish looking, without pink or maid outfits) and the other side of the cover is evil, with shadowy versions of the characters showing. Unlike the art box, you could walk out of a shop holding copies of the DVDs themselves with your head held high. The only issue I have with the DVDs is the infamous Vol. 2 misprint where an intelligent person decided to put the episode descriptions for the first 5 episodes as the descriptions for episodes 6-10. Due to Geneon going south, not many copies were released and even less were re-released with the error corrected.

Whilst talking about the R1 DVDs, it's only right to inform those not in the know that only the first 3 volumes (there was going to be 6) ever got released. Geneon imploded (the child porn art box was the cause, obviously) before they could finish releasing the series and we will probably never see the rest of the series released in English any time soon

Anyway, enough talking about the DVDs: Time to get down to business.

Plot: 8/10

Quite frankly, When They Cry is the hardest anime I've ever had the 'pleasure' of attempting to explain. The reason for this is that the story is told in various question (the mysteries aren't explained) and answer (the mysteries are explained) arcs, with nearly all them being out of sequence for the fun of it. This is further complicated by parallel universes, meaning each arc (each question and answer arc pair are set in the same universe) have no direct connection to most of the others. Are you confused yet?

All the arcs are set in the fictional village of Hinamizawa, most of the time during June 1983. Changes are made to the characters in each story, varying from them being heroes and villains depending. So, basically, even though the setting and characters don't change, the roles of each character often changes significantly in each of the stories.

The opening arc reveals that Keiichi, a young boy, moved to the town with his parents a month or so prior to the beginning of the series. By the time the story starts, Keiichi has already become friends with a group of of 4 girls in his class - Mion, Rena, Rika and Satoko. Things soon start to take a darker turn when Keiichi learns that the people of Hinamizawa worship a God known as Oyashiro, said to be the protector of the village. Keiichi discovers that there have been 4 murders each year on the same day as the Cotton Drifting festival; a festival that honours Oyashiro. Concerned about these serial murders, Keiichi starts to have doubts about his new friends when they lie to him about the murders...

Each arc is a variation of the above theme, with a small amount of information revealed about the mystery in each arc. It's very hard to follow if you have a terrible memory (like myself) and you'll probably find yourself re-watching certain arcs later on to see if you missed anything. If you're looking for an easy to follow series, I recommend you run away now.

It's also best to avoid When They Cry if you only enjoy light-hearted series. While the character design and story try to trick you into believing it's a kiddie series at first, you soon discover that When They Cry is actually a horror series - a true rarity in anime. You'd be surprised how shocking it is to see a cute face change into a psychotic one, along with the voice changing from soft to menacing. There's plenty of gore on show, too, with the main characters dying on a regular basis throughout.

My thoughts on the story you ask?

I LOVED the initial four episode arc. The first episode set the tone of the show by opening with someone finishing beating two people to death with a baseball bat, the person screaming and looking seriously disturbed whilst doing so. After that, the scene changes and, for the rest of the first episode, the story follows the largely uneventful day of Keiichi at school with his friends, allowing the viewer to slip into a false sense of security.

To my utter disappointment, I soon discovered the truth about the show; nearly every arc is set in a parallel universe. While it's an interesting and unique way of telling this mysterious story, I couldn't help but feel like the plot was standing still and not moving forward. I started to lose motivation as the story 'progressed', finding it hard to get into a show made up mostly of disconnected stories that will, rather inevitably, link up at the end.

Overall, I did enjoy the unique When They Cry experience. Outside of the parallel universe confusion, the main issue I have is that the mystery is far from solved after 26 episodes and there are still MANY more questions than there are answers... I'll have to watch the 2nd season if I want my headache to go away.

Characters: 8.5/10

In When They Cry, there's a group of 6 characters that play key roles: Keiichi, Mion, Rena, Rika, Satoko and Shion. Excluding Shion, all of them go to the same school (there's only 1 in Hinamizawa, the only class being a mixed age class). They are all young, none being older than about 15 or 16, some being pre-teen.

Keiichi, the only male in the 6, plays the role of the main character in the first few arcs. Through his eyes you are introduced to Hinamizawa and the other characters. He's a kind, friendly and easy to get on with guy, said to have scored high on IQ tests.

Mion plays the role of the class leader due to her age and dominant personality. She's a green-haired tomboy who hides her more girly side. Her family, the Sonozaki's, are the head family in Hinamizawa and she's the heir to them. The mystery of Oyashiro and the mysterious deaths that occur every year on the day of the Cotton Drifting festival seem to be linked to the Sonozaki family. Mion has a twin sister, Shion, who has been thought of as a cursed child since birth (twins are supposed to be a bad omen) and chucked into a distant boarding school away from the the family.

Rena moved to Hinamizawa a year before Keiichi. A shy girl who has a love of cute things, she comes across as the harmless. However, her past is a dark one and she's known for going into a rage at the mention of Oyashiro...

The final 2 main characters are friends and the youngest characters. Rika, a cute blue-haired girl, is the head of the Furude family; one of three main families in Hinamizawa. Much like Rena, she comes across as harmless, but she has the strange tendency to change into a more serious, more intelligent and more sinister person - As if two people were inside her. She will probably play a key role in solving the mystery in the second season. Satoko, a short haired blonde girl, has a tomboy type of personality, mixed in with a lot of insecurity. Her family is hated in Hinamizawa and all are either dead or missing, leaving only her.

There are also other, seemingly less important, characters who feature on a regular basis. The police officer Oishi and the village doctor Irie make appearances in most of the arcs, Oishi appearing in all of them.

Usually, a reviewer would evaluate the depth and development of the cast when rating. However, this is difficult in the case of When They Cry due to the story being told with parallel universes and the plot not progressing as a whole. I know a lot about the characters after seeing them various angles, playing both the good guy and bad guy, but it's near impossible to rate the development unless I rate the characters in each arc individually.

My favourite characters are the twins; Mion and Shion. Both characters get fleshed out more than the rest in the first series, a lengthy arc towards the end of the series revealing all about the sisters relationship, how their families work and, quite simply, how the sisters feel. The best eye candy (I'm SURE they're 16...well, 99% :D) and character development together - a win-win situation.

The thing I didn't like about the characters was how the characters acted rather bizarrely or out of character in certain arcs to play the roles they played in those arcs. For example, one character decided to kill someone to help one of his friends, who they had known for all of 5 minutes... What kind of person risks going to jail for life to help out someone they don't know very well? That plot point in particular seemed to be a bit forced to me.

I feel that 8.5/10 is a fair rating when, while the characters did have depth, the parallel universe aspect stopped any episode 1-26 character development.

Art: 8/10
Animation: 7/10

When They Cry uses cute, loli character designs to first fool the viewer and then shock them later. A horror series with cute looks, who would've thought it?

As you'd expect for a series that aired in 2006, the series is in widescreen format.

The art is pretty good. There's nothing amazing on show here, it doesn't compare to some of the other series that aired at the same time. I'm sure most people wouldn't mind too much; they'd be too distracted by cute young girls who hold meat cleavers whilst laughing in an insane manner!

The animation quality was a little disappointing. It's not an action series, so you can forgive it for not being brilliant, but the few scenes with fast movement that do occur failed to impress me.

Sound: 8.5/10

Rating the When They Cry soundtrack reminds of when I rated the Koi Kaze soundtrack: Koi Kaze didn't have too many tracks that stood out, yet the music fitted the show like a glove.

The opening theme of When They Cry is brilliant. Creepy, dark and a little scary, I couldn't imagine a better song for this type of the show. The ED is also very good; a dark, relaxing type of song, part of which also plays during the episode previews.

The soundtrack itself is made up of the dark type of music you'd expect to hear, mixed in with some cheerful music that plays during the more amusing parts of the show. Very little of the music made me want to download the soundtrack and listen to it on my PC, meaning it has little to no truly outstanding tracks in my opinion, but the soundtrack does fit the show perfectly and that's more important.

Just to give the voice acting a quick mention, the voice acting was as excellent as Japanese voice acting usually is. I was impressed by the performance of Satsuki Yukino; the voice actress behind Mion and Shion. I've added her to my favourite voice actor/actress list after watching When They Cry.

Total: 8/10

Although I did end the series feeling a little disappointed after the near perfect start, I do regard When They Cry as being up there with the best. It's certainly the best horror series out there... Not that there's much in the way of competition!

My rating may improve when I get around to watching the second season and the questions the first series raised are answered. However, I feel 8/10 is a fair rating for the first season on its own.",1206316800,2,11683,4.5430747263208

2791864,5,B000O77M0A,"Higurashi is a lengthy and shocking. Yet, the sadistic (but cute) characters really make this anime hilarious. Yes, there is plenty of killing, but I really enjoyed watching the out-of-place cute youngsters turn into cold-blooded murderers for the most insanely unbelievable reasons.

Meiichi Maebara, a teenage boy, lives in Hinamizawa, a peaceful rural village. He plays and has fun with his friends, all girls. However, he quickly learns that Hinamizawa is a cursed town, in which every year at the Watanagashi Festival at least one person dies.

To make matters worse, his friends are trying to hide the truth from him--that they could have killed those people. Rena keeps creeping up to Maebara with a huge knife, the doctors inject him with needles, and people are dying left and right.

And yet, after Maebara commits suicide by stabbing his throat with his fingernails, the characters come back to life...
Well, not really.

Higurashi no naku koro ni (When They Cry) is actually based on a drama video game. There are many different chapters with different takes on the same story. For the first four chapters, lots of people die, and there is no happy ending. The next four chapters, however, give the reasons for the deaths. And yes, there is a happy ending in the last chapter.

However, this is a surprisingly complex soap opera, involving children who are abused by their aunts and uncles, kill others because they are in love and get possessed by ogre spirits. Yes, maybe this story is a little too unbelievable, but the murderers' motives are so bizarre and strange that the series actually turns into a comedy. The alternative plots are very intriguing, each one revealing another piece to the fascinating plot which involves drugs, UFO crashes and, yes, bioterrorism (don't ask).

This series is crazy, bloody and definitely not for kids. However, its storytelling is very gutsy, original and hilarious. There's nothing better than watching little kids kill each other for the stupidest reasons in a crazy town filled with conspiracies. I highly recommend this.",1196899200,2,2078,5.043731778425656
2791865,5,B000O77M0A,"Definitely NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!  I think what everyone else has already written pretty much describes this series pretty accurately.  This is a series that is totally not what it seems like initially, a la Hostel.  The first episode in each story arc seems all normal, but as the episodes progress, they become darker and darker.  I almost wanted to turn it off at certain points in time, but was so intrigued by it, that I couldn't.  If you're looking for a feel good series, skip this one.  If you like horror flicks that throw you for a loop, there is a distinct possibility that you will enjoy this series (I grew to like all of the characters, so it was interesting to watch as their personalities changed as each story progressed).

8183531,5,B000O77M0A,"I was really shocked to see this here since this particular series is no longer licensed in North America by any company, but it bring back a lot of memories. This series is my absolute all-time favorite and is well-known for many reasons. First, for its well thought out story. Second for its overall popularity in Japan, and third for the amazing flop the anime was in North America, mostly attributed to the very poor quality of the English dub. The voice acting in English was very clunky and forced most of the time and none of them could do a decent deranged laugh or psychopathic teenager and they failed to capture the cutesy aspects of their normal voices as the Japanese cast did. This was a rare blunder for Funimation since their dubs usually fall between decent to great, and have even produced a few dubs that were better than the original Japanese (This is the only company that I can say this for).

Still, this is worth watching for many reasons. Mostly, the story. The main plot device is fairly common in the mystery-horror genre (without giving away anything about the story, one can find examples of this plot device in episode of the X-files, Buffy, The Twilight Zone and several movies). It is a good way to have the audience confused and guessing about what is going on, a must for a mystery story. In particular it allows for an easy transition for American audiences to the ""arc"" style anime that is commonly used when adapting visual novels to anime, a style that is pretty much never seen in American TV. Indeed, this worked well since I remember when this was first released in the US all my friends would come up to me and say how confused they were in episode 5 (and the others) when characters that died in the first arc returned and they seemed to be in another timeline (hint). Not wanting to spoil what was going on, I just explained the arc style of anime adaptations to them.",1424131200,,1912,4.526011560693641
