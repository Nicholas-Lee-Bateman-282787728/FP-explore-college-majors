8668799,1,B00LXDQ8T0,Watch Nekromantik 1 or 2 if you want to watch a good necrophile movie. Or make your own. Like I'm doing! :),1526688000,,107,3.909090909090909
8668800,5,B00LXDQ8T0,"Well what would one expect from a movie depicting necrophilia?  Uhm, necrophilia scenes maybe? :)  It's never been about a great story, a roaring soundtrack or interesting characters now has it?  I liked it a lot since I enjoy watching these scenes.  Basically, if you like Buttgereit's Nekromantik 1 and/or 2, be sure to pick this one up.
My copy also contained a short film called Paraphilia which is equally ""interesting"" and pretty graphic.",1511136000,,444,4.95945945945946

I personally really liked this one.
Plus the cover art is very badass!",1424131200,,146,4.88
8668802,1,B00LXDQ8T0,"I guess, according to the last review, there is something very wrong with me. I have been collecting indie and foreign horror films for years, and this movie evokes 2 words in me instantly-
Utter Crap.
Horrible acting, terrible storyline and no real special effects to speak of, this movies leaves you feeling like you've just been robbed of 52 minutes of your life that you can't get back.
The ""corpse"" spoken of in the description is in one scene in the first 5 minutes of the film and is never seen again with no explanation of where it went to.
Give me 20.00 dollars loan me a camea, and even I could top this waste of film.
You want visceral?  Horrifying? Something that will melt your brain? Check out ""Header"", ""Melancholie der Engel"", ""A Serbian Film"" uncut version, or ""Inside"".
Don't waste your time or money on this ""poor man's rip-off"" of the cult classic ""Nekromantik"".
Any Disney film is more horrifying than this movie.",1416009600,8,934,4.626506024096385
