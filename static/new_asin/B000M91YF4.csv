8167298,5,B000M91YF4,"I have been a fan of Carlos Saura for decades since the release of Carmen back in the 80's. Since then, he has produced some of the most innovative movies/performance pieces such as El Amor Brujo and Tango. This album is the pinnacle of his work in my humble opinion. Each segment is a unique performance piece, uniquely choreographed and filmed brilliantly and creatively. Truly, each piece is so unique that you quickly realize that the pieces are, in themselves, a finished movie sequence.
Though it is NOT a region 2 (North America compatible disc), it is worth investing in an All-Regions disc player just to see this film. I cannot recommend this enough if you love flamenco, dance and Spanish music (based upon the Albeniz piece by the same name). This is a journey through Spain of the highest order",1360627200,,807,4.7304964539007095
8167299,4,B000M91YF4,"you're into all genres of dancing.  I was hoping to see more flamenco because Sara Baras is featured, but the title IBERIA really warned that it would not be so.  All regional dances are overpowered by modernisms.",1319155200,,213,4.72972972972973
