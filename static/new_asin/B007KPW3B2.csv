8519151,5,B007KPW3B2,A heartbreaking story of life on the Great Plains.  A must see!  This was filmed maybe 10 years ago....I wonder how they are all doing now.,1513209600,,139,4.3076923076923075
8519152,1,B007KPW3B2,Deserves zero stars--Would not play in any DVD player. Worthless!,1464048000,,65,5.6
8519153,5,B007KPW3B2,"Fantastic documentary.  I showed this documentary as part of a unit covering The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie.  It was great to see some of the topics in the novel - racism, poverty, alcoholism - covered in this documentary.  Instead of the student imagining what reservation life is like, they got to see it firsthand.  I would definitely recommend this to middle and high school classes, as there are no inappropriate scenes or topics discussed.",1450137600,3,480,4.9625
8519154,5,B007KPW3B2,"I teach cultural diversity courses at the University of Phones, and I use this documentary to talk about the poorest ethnic group in America. Most people have no idea that life on the rez is so spartan and challenging.

As a Native American, and as a cousin to several of the people featured in this documentary, I can assure you that this documentry is no exaggeration.

Accurate Poignant, Compassionate.",1377216000,3,405,4.855072463768116
8519155,4,B007KPW3B2,"As a mental health professional working with Native American populations, enough cannot be said about the legacy of a planned genocide of an entire population of people that began with colonization of our country. It is time to recognize and begin repair of damage done, which is so well portraited in this video. My only criticism is that it was never mentioned that the state of ""reservations"" is directly due to what happens when you are a conquered people. History is writen by those who win the war, those who lost are forgotten.",1355961600,4,534,4.752688172043011
