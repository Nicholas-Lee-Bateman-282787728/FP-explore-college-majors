1732470,5,B000069HUI,"I caught the review of this film in a local street rag. And I am really glad I did. This is one of the best homosexual theme movies out on film, and the two main guys have done a jam-up job of acting.
There is no sex scene's between the two men, but there is a sense of very much love for each other and their kisses are real and not strained. Kudos for these two great actors. The picture has won many awards! Leonardo Sbaraglia, (Nene) , Wild Tango,
Wild Horses, and Eduardo Noreiga (ll) ( Angel) , The Devil's Backbone, Abre Los ojos, Thesis. Are known as 'the twins' , but they are not brothers, they are lover's and they are for hire robbers. The way they look at each other and the way they care for each other is very moving.
The story is about a heist that goes wrong in Buenos Aires and policemen are shot and the newspapers know who did the job. The gang has to skip to Uruguay in hopes they can stay there until the heat is off of them. But things do not go their way, and they have to move again....
I cannot say enough about the two main characters, they were excellent in their portrayal of The Twins, always together and always looking out for each other.
Also, Pablo Echarre as the driver did an excellent job. But, the tone of the movie is in the court of Nene and Angel. And their love for each other.  One of the best male to male flicks to come out since Urbania. To bad Hollywood cannot turn them out!!
Burnt Money ,(Plata Quemada) will not be for all... but if you want to see some great acting and a caring no bars held male relationship, then you must run to see it. Out on DVD Oct 1, 2002 . This is the theatrical version not the dvd!  I give this a 5/5 !

1732471,5,B000069HUI,"This film, original title ""Plata Quemada"", totally is a complete deal.
The gay magazine of Espana, Zero magazine, calls this movie one of the most important films of the past 10 years. It represents perhaps the next film in gay movies where ""gayness"" is not the end-all-be-all focus of the film (as is the case in gay movies made by Hollywood)
A wonderfully acted film with plenty of action and a gripping story. Plata Quemada is the story of the 2 principal bank robbers, Nene and Angel, one from Argentina, the other from Spain. They are lovers. But this is not a ""gay film"" in that the gayness is not the focus of the story. But it is central to understanding the emotional impact that this film carries. Think ""Bonnie and Clyde"" but Bonnie is a beautiful sexy muscular latin man.
Based on true events that took place in Argentina and Uruguay in 1965, it is about  a bank robbery gone wrong.  But it is also about the 4 main characters and how they relate to each other.
Unlike american films where american actors (gay and straight) seem so wooden and artificial when they play gay characters (i.e. Interview with a vampire Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt) due to their own fear of seeming ""too genuinely  gay"", Spain has a wonderful history of straight actors who make you believe the passion and love between two men. Law of Desire with the very young Antonio Banderas as un chico obsessed with his boyfriend was one. This is another.
Leonardo Sbraglia and one of Spain's major hunks, (el chulo) Eduardo Noriega, draw you into the tortured lives of 2 men who are weird, unbalanced and.... love each other without limits. The end of the movie had me longing for a love that was as strong as what these men show on screen.
If you like a great story with great emotional content, lots of action, beautiful beautiful men both latin (Pablo Echarri y Leonardo Sbraglia) and spanish (Noriega)  and a message that will get to you straight gay or whatever, get this movie.",1029369600,67,1962,4.581196581196581

1732569,4,B000069HUI,"A noir film based on an actual heist in Argentina in the mid-1960's. The only thing marring the film is some uneven editing. Performances are excellent, but the directing is occasionally misguided.

The production it top quality and very artistic.  The subtitles generally don't move so quickly that you have to rewind - but it does happen at times.  The emotional and climatic ending will have you on the edge of your seat.  I am very pleased that I inadvertantly stumbled upon this film and purchased it.,1386633600,,449,4.705128205128205

1732608,5,B000069HUI,"Probably the most poignant, true to life and deeply sad movie of all time in the genre of crime drama.  A friend said it was a male gay Thelma and Louise.  I disagree; it was far more realistic than Thelma and Louise, and it wsa NOT fiction~!  And, yet again, this movie demonstrates a fact that anyone who knows gay men well will tell you: most gay men are not sissy or weak; which is more than can be said for the character of that Uruguayan girl that was a traitor to them all, knowing full well that her actions would lead to the guys being massacred by the laws.  I saw the movie with a group of 20 Latino guys; some of them tried to shoot out the tv screen~! Every guy in the room had been betrayed by a girlfriend or boyfriend at one time or another~~it was VERY painfull for them to see this so well portrayed in a movie.  What is the only crime actually enumerated in the USA Constitution~?  Treason.  ""There is no crime greater than Treason"".  Indeed.  There is no act more loathsome than betrayal; there is no dirtier word than ""traidor"".",1379462400,4,1049,4.257575757575758

1732610,4,B000069HUI,"From an LGBT perspective I thought this was a good film.  While the central characters are lovers, the fact that they are gay is incidental to the plot of the movie",1377216000,,164,4.290322580645161
1732611,1,B000069HUI,"just too many things wrong with the story; it was way too long, unrealistic, how can someone who prays to God commit the crimes they commit? also, pick a movie genre and stick with it, etc.; the sad part is, it could have been a really good ""relationship"" story, showing a gay couple dealing with mental health issues, what it takes to stay in a mature, adult relationship, etc.; I guess I can't really blame the movie...the disclaimer at the end says this is a true story",1376524800,,472,4.436781609195402

1732613,3,B000069HUI,"OK, I guessing most people who watched this movie never saw the original which was in Black & White.  But for me, the addition of another male was at times confusing.  Maybe that was factual, but I didn't see the need to include him. If memory serves me correctly the original film focused more on the relationship between Nene and Angel before the robbery.  It is a good film, but I still liked the original one better.",1374364800,,420,4.428571428571429

1732657,3,B000069HUI,"Was not that crazy about this movie. The movie started off very interesting then went flat.

The story may drag on a bit at some parts, but it will be a shame not to watch it to the very end!",1361836800,,336,4.435483870967742
1732662,4,B000069HUI,"I was very interested in this film for a few different reasons. The first being that it's based on a true story, which, aside from a few minor unique plot points, felt like any other heist story (fictional or not). The second being the relationship between the two main characters, which felt awkward and distant at best, and forced into the plot as vague subtext at it's worst. The irony in that is that it's a main subject of the film. There is no reason to handle it so awkwardly. The third reason I wanted to see the film is that it's the first same-sex ""mobster"" flick I've ever heard of. I felt it would be interesting to see the contrast of a same-sex duo against the stereotypical machismo of the mobster world, but it wasn't that interesting at all. The only conflict in that regard was ""The Twins"" being called the ""f-word"" in a couple scenes, which was portrayed mostly as a kind of brotherly hazing as opposed to being dramatically offensive or hurtful in any way.

Aside from those points, overall the film was clumsy. There were a few continuity jumps that confused me, and, even though I backed it up to see if I missed a transition or something, it was just simply cut in a poor manor at those points. The acting was okay, nothing spectacular. The characters were unpredictable (in a bad way). There were many scenes that felt unrehearsed, awkward and unconvincing, or just simply unnecessarily vague and convoluted.

Despite all this, it was different enough to enjoy it, and I think I would watch it again. There were actually a couple parts where I felt my tear ducts filling up, so the film did manage to invoke some level of emotion in me. That's always a good sign I suppose. I give it a 4 out of 5. It dares to blend a taboo(ish) same-sex love story with a cliche Heist plot... and only marginally succeeds at both; however, there is something unique about this film that made it feel fresh and enjoyable.",1360454400,,1928,4.505714285714285
1732663,5,B000069HUI,"I've watched this movie over and over. It's amazing, from the story to the complexity of the characters, this is a film that must be seen.",1360022400,,138,4.346153846153846

1732695,5,B000069HUI,"If you ever saw the classic Bonnie & Clyde with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunnaway, that is the best comparison I can get for you. Except, Bonnie is a Man and takes place in Argentina & Uruguay.(so it is in Spanish w/ subtitiles)  They really spend time developing the relationship between Nene and Angel (Historically known as Brignone and Dorda) and I really felt empathy with them and was rooting for them the whole time.
One thing I like about this movie is that it blows away gay stereotypes... like we all run around in speedos saying ""girl"" drinking cosmos while working at salons. You have two somewhat psychopatic twisted macho men in love with each other, going around robbing banks and killing people.
But in the end it comes down to good story telling, the suspense is there, action is there, sex is there (all hetero sex oddly), and the drama is there. I definately classify this as a drama with romantic action elements... But really I defer back to my earlier comparison to the original Bonnie and Clyde, that's pretty much what to expect, but a little bit dirtier, a little bit more violent, a little bit more sexy, and gay.

afterthought: the beginning of the movie might make you think the whole movie is going to be narrated for you, don't worry, it's not, just the opening chapter to share information. though there are one or two parts with a voice over from Nene or Angel",1356998400,4,1390,4.578313253012048

1732702,4,B000069HUI,"When one leaves a theater or finishes a movie, and is left either speechless or numb from the impact of such, then one has had an experience deserving of a review. This is one such movie, which has at its heart the exploration of a relationship devoid of logic and reason, and yet one which imbues love and determination. One partner clearly suffering a psychosis due to his own mental illness causes his lover to enter a world of self-sacrifice, self destruction and the ultimate realisation of truth. love has no understanding in such circumstances, and would seem to a perverse irony within itself.

The script is brutal as is the vision of the director. The acting is brilliant, as each character delves into their very beings to portray a crude, brutal honesty, which comes from life experience. At times one forgets that these are actors portraying a story, and your experience is of each minute is crisp, succinct and breath taking. The fact that the movie is based on fact, makes the impact even more surreal.",1277251200,3,1017,4.745762711864407

1732726,1,B000069HUI,"At the risk of oversimplifying, this was kinda like a gay version of Bonnie and Clyde.  *Burnt Money* is about a gay couple involved in a botched bank robbery in Argentina in 1965.  They escaped to Uruguay where their relationship unraveled and where the police caught up with them.

One main problem about this movie was that it dragged on endlessly.  One has some kind of mental issue going on.  The other is somewhat of a sex addict or rather he seeks thrills, despite the fact he's supposed to be in hiding.  And with the traditional machismo thing going on among Latino men, these two men just cannot be comfortable with each other.

When things come to an end, that is, when the police trapped them, they reconnect and renew their love for each other.

Overall, a disappointing film!",1210032000,10,789,4.625899280575539
1732727,5,B000069HUI,"'Burnt Money' has the familiar scaffolding of the botched heist but it is really more interested in relationship drama - but on an archetypical  scale, and all of it done in a languid, elegiac, chiaroscuro, and yet, stiflingly hothouse and tango mood.  The cinematography is lush and dark and grimy and gorgeous.  And it's clear from the language of the voiceover narration, the characters' nicknames, the religious iconography (especially piet & crucifix), and that the movie is divided into 'chapters,' that it is also a structured tale, despite its true-crime inspiration.  Not a morality tale, more like a ballad... El Nene (the baby) embodies the cool, smart, protective antihero, while ngel is his nave, mad-saintly emotional core, and that pairing itself of the Twins also echoes many 'buddy' tropes...

But despite the stylized/symbolic distance, there is so much intimacy in this movie it hurts.  The chemistry between the two leads is insanely intense and fragile and beautiful.  But not sentimental.  Or histrionic.  The movie and its emotions are violent and with a certain degree of romanticization but the exchanges between the Twins are so 'real' that it's as if it weren't acting...  Sbaraglia especially is good at packing intense love and devotion, frustration, and everything else into a mere look.  Kinda makes you wish you were the recipient of that look - or even of the pitying consolation that he gives to Giselle.  OMG, the lost years from having known/seen this only recently!

1732730,3,B000069HUI,"Hot actors and visually stunning biggish buget Argentinian true crime gay noir thriller, this could have been soooo good, alas the gays are religiously impotent through 95% of the movie (brought early on by mental breakdown) so all the gay potental action goes out the window and we are left watching frustration with frustration.  Not so good.  However... last 20 minutes of this movie you should be floored by the plottwist and action plus last minute gay snog saves the day.  The movie-loving but eternally starved gay audience might enjoy it better if they don't expect the misleading DVD cover to deliver (that torso scene is 5 seconds at the beginning and this kind of sensual nudity is not repeated though there is some nudity au natural).

Story goes like this; its the 1965 in Bueons Aires and big bank money shipment robbery is planned by various crimebosses who hire 3 hitmen to execute it, 2 of which are gay and lovers.  The job is a fiasco with cops being killed but they at least get awy with the money and eventually flee Argentina to Uruguy but knowing more or less the whole time they will be cought spending most of their hide-out time bored out of their sculls and drugged out of their minds.  The gay couple seems to break up and one of them seeks comfort tricking at night and forms eventually some sort of a relationship with a local moll.  Eventually they are sold out by the people who hired them and cops and army attack but their reaction is no surrender and a mini war breaks out as the 3 of them Alamo style hold the fort to the last drop of sweaty blood.  Oh and the homos re-unite just in time to be shot.

The main trouble with this film is the overlong middlepart with the one half of the gay couple cheating on his lover with a woman (loads of graphic straight sex) this dragged on for way way to long and might as well have ben cut out altogether as it made no difference to the plot.  Ok I still liked this movie enough to give it 3 stars and I'm happy to have bought it as I think I will want to watch the best parts annually (but skipping over about 40% of the middle).

Therefore I got a little lost in places and had to go back and replay some spots. Not too bad though as the plot kept my interest. Sound and picture quality is excellent. Plot is from a true story. The love between the central characters, a gay couple known as ""The Twins"" is a story of undying love in the midst of personal inner conflict, frustrations and many life events happening in the meantime. If you are looking for hot steamy sex scenes between the two guys, theres not much there to see but the acting is very good and you get the sense that these two actors were the actual couple come back to make this film. Their chemistry together is awesome and very realistic. They appear to have enjoyed doing this project together and you are left believeing the actors themselves formed a lifetime friendship through this project. There were things I didn't like in the story but since it is based on a true story, there isn't much you can do but accept it as part of what makes the whole thing go around. I would recommend this film highly. It contains lots of adventure, suspense, drama, action and warmth weaved throughout all of that.

Nene and Angel are occasional lovers and partners in crime. Angel hears voices all the time because his emotions take control of him. The robbery has an effect on him. He wants to get out of South America and go to New York. Nene wants to have a good time. He can't control his sexual urges and takes on both male and female lovers. The one person that he desires is Angel. Angel's mood swings force him to seek sexual gratification elsewhere. He get caught up with the prostitute Giselle. Giselle is emotionally damaged. Although a prostitute, she is a human being with feelings. She has feelings for Nene and Nene takes advantage of those feelings. She is also a climatic downfall for the robbers Cuervo, Nene and Angel. She emotionally explodes as she realizes that Nene and Angel are lovers, not siblings.

In addition to the emotional high in ""Burnt Money"", also unravels the corruption in South American politics. The economy was not good. The government officials were concerned about fattening their pockets than helping its citizens. Military governments were common during that period overthrowing presidential officials for the sake of power.

Yet the ""heat"" doesn't cool down, and three of the four gradually emerge from their hiding place, Nene and Angel to frequent a surrealistic amusement park itself frequented by prostitutes of both sexes.

1732768,4,B000069HUI,"I stumbled upon this movie as I was trying to find something that was neither a Hollywood marketing by numbers movie nor an ""independent movie"", as the latter does not guarantee that it will be any good. For examples of one of the the worst independent movies ever see ""Buffalo 66"" and you may never want to watch a movie again.
But back to ""Burnt Money"". Although I had never heard of the movie before seeing it, I took a chance as more and more, foreign directors are managing to take some of the better elements of Hollywood releases without resorting to navel gazing exercises of some independent films.
In a nutshell, this movie is superb. Although incorrectly marketed as a ""steamy homosexual"" movie with elements of Bonnie and Clyde, the movie is really a cinematic treat that encompasses a range of human emotions and what it may mean to love someone. Maybe the marketing got more people to see it (and that would not be a bad thing), but it's just not like you'd be lead to believe. But this is about the movie, not advertising.
The movie tells the true story of two bankrobbers, who are known as the Twins because of the emotional connection that they share, which in turn, is the impetus for how they live and rob. It's not because they simply look alike as some allude to as it refers more to the ""look"" in their eyes. Although these men meet in a filthy public bathroom in the mid 1960s, said seamy setting only serves as the point of departure for what is essentially a love story that to me goes beyond sexuality. Stop reading here if you don't want any story revelations....
The two lovers never actually make love (in physiological terms) or have sex during the movie. In fact, heterosexual sex abounds and so does an intriguing encounter with a female prostitute that may or may not establish that one of the lead characters is bisexual. The important point is that it's irrelevant as the story succeeds largely in part to its refusal to do the Hollywood thing, which would be to make it about being ""gay"" or making it a ""buddy"" picture. Here we have really a bunch of screwed up people looking for love and a way to connect.
Along the way we meet some great characters who are cast perfectly (without exception) and the director shows a great gift to find a balance between the personal story within a picture that looks like a million bucks (or rather $100 million in movie dollars) when it was probably financed with a great less deal of money. I am amazed how some of the more ""commercial"" foreign directors can make a buck go so far while the Hollywood flicks can't manage to make the same movie at any cost.
While the two leads are spectacular, so are key supporting players. There is a scene in which what is in essence, the third leading player, does a dance and you can see a star being born, much in the same manner as Brad Pitt did in ""Thelma and Louise"".
I am rambling a bit because I just saw the movie and I am still absorbing it. The direction is materful as is the cinematography, but what truly makes this movie for me is that the emotions are raw and it puts out there (in an interesting fashion) how passion and love are not as portrayed in Hollywood.
This is without a doubt a movie for adults. There is violence (but not more than your standard PG-13 fare in Hollywood terms), sex (as there are at least two explicit heterosexual encounters), rampant drug use and homoerotic scenes that show the true passion that the two lead characters have for one another. It also has a great scene between a female prostitute and one of the leading characters that you'd NEVER see in a Hollywood flick. This scene to me is the essence of why this movie is so good. It's not sanitized for mass consumption and in turn makes it perfect for mass consumption. I've never seen a movie like this and I could go are far as to give it a 5, but I have to save those to give real impact to those that truly stand out way above the rest. I'll give this one a 4+++++++++ and highly recommend it if you are not homophobic not are expecting soft-porn or a bunch of naked men. If so you'll be disappointed. Here you'll find people who are naked emotionally and the sexiest and most tender scenes are not those that you'd expect. In fact, with the exception of how they first met and (in my opinion another scene in a bathroom that I could have done without) there is no convention here. I hope that this movie, along with others like ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (which is one of the best movies I've ever seen) will lead to more character-driven movies both in the US and abroad.
I understand that most movie studios wonder if ""it"" will play in mid-America when making decisions about whether to give the go ahead for most movies, but maybe they should not think so little of mid-America and focus on financing good/promising film-makers while being present to make sure that they are not self-indulgent but a reflection of a vision that, if it's good, will find an audience. This is particularly important for movies with adult themes as for every ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (which was ok) there may be another ""Burnt Money"" waiting to be made.",1076284800,14,5149,4.461293743372217

[Plata Quemada]

(Spain/France/Uruguay - 2000)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Argentina, 1965: Following a botched robbery on an armored car, during which they stole money belonging to a corrupt police officer, two gay lovers - rebellious rich kid Nene (Leonardo Sbaraglia) and borderline schizophrenic Angel (Eduardo Noriega) - are forced to flee with their accomplices to Uruguay where they take refuge in a decaying apartment building. Continually denied sexual favors by Angel due to his worsening mental condition, Nene takes up with a sympathetic prostitute (Leticia Bredice), leading to jealousy, betrayal and tragedy...

Based on a non-fiction novel by Argentinian writer/critic Ricardo Piglia, and directed by Marcelo Pineyro (a former producer whose film career was kickstarted in 1985 by Luis Puenzo's acclaimed drama THE OFFICIAL STORY), BURNT MONEY is an unexpected masterpiece. Photographed with noirish intensity by Alfredo Mayo (HIGH HEELS) and underscored by an ironic soundtrack of lazy jazz and contemporary English/Spanish pop songs, the narrative is driven by powerful emotions (sexual and otherwise), and when the highly strung characters finally react against their unhappy circumstances, the resulting violence is bleak and uncompromising, and the sex scenes are equally graphic.

The sacred and profane are interlinked in various ways (one extraordinary sequence cross-cuts between an act of worship in a Uruguayan church and an unpleasant encounter between Nene and a frightened youth in a public toilet), and the sweaty atmosphere is broken only by an explosive climax where the main protagonists are forced to take responsibility for their actions. Former TV actor Pablo Echarri (""Chiquititas"", ""El Signo"", etc.) plays a younger, headstrong member of the outlaw gang, blinded by youthful arrogance to the danger in which they have all become enmeshed, while Bredice (NINE QUEENS) plays one of the few significant female characters in this otherwise all-male scenario, a brittle creature unable to prevent herself falling in love with the wrong guy, with appalling consequences for everyone.

More than anything else, however, BURNT MONEY is a love story, played to perfection by two of the finest young actors of their generation. Spanish heartthrob Eduardo Noriega forged his career in popular mainstream entries such as THESIS, OPEN YOUR EYES and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, while Leonardo Sbaragalia made a name for himself in his native Argentina, where he worked with Pineyro on a number of lesser-known productions (TANGO FEROZ: LA LEYENDA DE TANGUITO, CABALLOS SALVAJES). Casting these two beautiful, experienced young men as lovers in a violent true-crime drama could not have been more fortuitous: Their devotions are rarely consummated on-screen (all of the aforementioned sex scenes are heterosexual), except for a chaste kiss at the end of the film, and an earlier, erotically-charged sequence in which Nene tends to a wound on Angel's shoulder and initiates a sexual advance, only to be rebuffed because of Angel's mental condition. And yet, Noriega and Sbaraglia are ultra-convincing as the macho thugs who would literally die for one another, and they invest every gesture, every inflection, with genuine romantic chemistry. These guys simply burn up the screen! Look out for the devastating sequence in which Nene 'confesses' to Bredice about his relationship with Angel, where he describes their mutual affection with heartbreaking emotional candor.

But when all's said and done, these characters are also drug-takers and ruthless killers, and Pineyro refuses to soft-pedal their capacity for evil, which may divide some viewers unable to reconcile such a cruel dichotomy. However, the climactic sequence simply reinforces Pineyro's true objectives: For all its dramatic fireworks and sexual tension, BURNT MONEY is a story of undying love, as touching and beautiful as any this reviewer has ever seen. They may be thieves and murderers, but when Nene looks into Angel's eyes, you know instinctively that their love transcends life and death, and is destined to last an eternity.

Not just a great gay film, BURNT MONEY is also a terrific love story, a heartstopping thriller, and an outstanding example of the recent upsurge in popular Spanish entertainment. Highly recommended!",1049587200,62,4360,5.52623688155922
1732791,5,B000069HUI,"I must admit I have a soft spot for foreign film - it's almost a magical experience for me to enjoy how other cultures deal with human issues, and often in a more honest way than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Also, relying on subtitles to understand what is going on has the most amazing effect - you are forced to stare at the screen for the whole film and therefore become more engrossed in the story and characters. So when a friend sent me a copy of Burnt Money as a present I was estatic, and after viewing the movie, that elation has stayed with me.
What amazes me about most foreign films is the honesty they portray when dealing with human emotion. There is no watering-down to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but a genuine effort to get inside to our most basic thoughts and emotions.
Burnt money is no exception. The film essentially deals with a relationship between 2 men. Though unlike any film I've seen before, that relationship is detailed under the umbrella of the violent, criminal underground world. The usual themes of gay relationships are on display here, but we get to see them from a totally different perspective. This film helps to challenge our thinking and our ideals about relationships, love and change. Powerful stuff.
The DVD itself is quite handsomely packaged. The quality of the transfer is average - no benchmark DVD here but nonetheless better than what you would see on VHS. No special features at all, except for the the original trailer and four trailers for other DVD releases.

It's about desire, possesion and give up. The pace of this movie is a bit slow, but it does not make me feel bad.
I don't know if the director is a gay or not. All women characters in this movie are described as cunny and selfish. The director is a little mean to women characters in this movie. So if he is not a gay, understanding of this film will be more interesting.

1732794,5,B000069HUI,"BURNT MONEY is another film from Argentina that places that country in the forefront of exemplary film making.  After viewing this compelling movie of a retelling of a bank heist that occurred in Buenos Aires in 1965 one wonders why Hollywood has so much difficulty presenting credible and sensual male/male relationships.  The chief characters in this story are two lovers (played to perfection by Leonardo Sbaraglia as 'Nene' and Eduardo Noriega II as 'Angel') who, known as The Twins, are hired to assist in a heist.  This event occurs at the very beginning of this two hour film, leaving the rest of the movie to explore the intricate relationship between the lovers as they elude the law in their flight to Uruguay.  The physical passion between thes two men is palable, erotic, and as profound as any love story to hit the screen.  When the stress of the life of hiding drives Angel to focus on the 'voices' in his head, his physical withdrawal sends Nene outside the relationship to satisfy his sexual needs.  One of these encounters is with a woman he meets in a bar and results in a confessional talk about his gayness and ultimately ends up in one of the most sensuously graphic sexual scenes since ""Last Tango In Paris"". Yes, in this story that is focused on a gay relationship, the sexual encounters filmed are heterosexual ones and very well filmed at that.  The physical relationship between Nene and Angel is far less graphic and yet far more sensual for being so.  Would that Hollywood could make gay characters so wholly three dimensional as Director Marcelo Pineyro does!  The supporting cast includes more beautiful people than Sbaraglia and Noriega:  Leticia Bredice and Dolores Fonzi play the sexy female roles and there is a cameo by cabaret singer Adriana Varela whose luminously sexual singing focuses the sensuality of this story completely.  Well written, well photographed and well directed, BURNT MONEY starts on a high note and just gathers momentum right to the devastating climax.  A superb film.",1034208000,75,2027,4.912023460410557

They are part of a team of robbers.  The team robs a bank and in the process kill a policeman.  Their identies are known and they must leave the country to get to safety.
Told from the perspective of the robbers, this movie is no more gay than Resevoir Dogs was straight.  The sexuality of the robbers is merely a character aspect of the men.  So to delve more deeply into their gayness would be insulting and trivialize this film.  The filmmakers do not treat their homosexuality with more importance in this film than other filmmakers do lead character's heterosexuality.
We know from the beginning that this film can only have one outcome - and that is a tragic one.  These are not nice people as a whole.  Certainly, they have wonderful traits, but so do the most evil of men.  It is to the filmmaker's credit that the many levels of these characters are brought out rather than making them two dimensional cut outs of a predictable nature.  Regardless of their horrible deeds, we are tied emotionally to these men - these robbers.  We root for them and hope (we know in vain) that they will succeed.
Set In Buenos Aires in 1965, this movie is based on true events that happened at that time.  If half of what is portrayed is realisitically portrayed, then the source material was a film begging to be made.  Tragic and emotional, Burnt Money gives us a very exciting and engaging cops and robbers story told with thrilling scenes and touching emotional performances.  Believable and believably portrayed.
