I find somethings humourous, but as a whole it is a quality movie for 1935.  Those of us who were kids when these movies were first seen on TV, were able to use our imaginations and be much more creative than many of today's hi tech kids.  It is all relevant.  It was great for it's day and should be considered as such.  If we are unable to accept that today's movies will be jokes to our grandchildren, then perhaps we should not watch anything older that a year or so and remain comfortable within our little narrow boxes.",1003449600,2,649,4.286885245901639
