2692085,1,B000KJTG8I,Okay - I love lassie as much as the next person - and I was really excited that we were going to introduce our children to a show my husband and I loved as children - but I have to say - the best of lassie's subject matter was about as exciting as watching paint dry -- if anyone is trying to do this for their kids - I would suggest buying something like the first season of flipper - was fantastic - my kids (10 and 6) loved it,1258502400,,429,3.7777777777777777
2692086,3,B000KJTG8I,"I've had to take away two stars off because the producers of this DVD did not give a season one, two, three etc. of these Lassie TV episodes. It was Tommy Rettig who first played as Jeff Miller in the Lassie TV show, later to be followed by John Provost. When Tommy Rettig started to become too big and old for the TV series, he was replaced by John Provost. It was a nice transition from Tommy Rettig to John Provost. I loved the Lassie series as much as any kid back in the late 1950's to early 1960's. So I make an appeal to the producers of Lassie. Please put out DVD's of the seasons of the Lassie TV show.",1228694400,12,611,4.0578512396694215
2692087,4,B000KJTG8I,"This is a wonderful family show. The only thing I didn't like about these episodes is that Lassie didn't do enough stuff. She is so amazing in a lot of her shows. But overall, they are good, wholesome shows with a good storyline; just not the Best of the Lassie Shows.",1213660800,6,268,4.2745098039215685
2692088,5,B000KJTG8I,"nicely reproduced in great clarity, these are heart-warming stories for the whole family from an era that no longer is with us.  Parents can watch these with their children without having to mute, fastforward, or even ""ear muff"" the kids.  My 5 year old and 7 year old love the shows and we are collecting as many as we can.  This and the ""Christmas"" collection are a joy to own...",1174780800,36,381,4.414285714285715
