8597798,5,B004LCU1WU,"Kawashima Yoshiko (1990) has to be Ms. Mui's best film.  A

tragic story about the last princess of Manchuria.  Her life was filled with sadness and despair that no one should have to ever experince.  But she's also a survior who'll do what ever it takes to survive.  From the time of her birth as the crowned princess of Manchuria to her time with the Imperial court of Emperor Hirohito,  Ms. Kawashima adepts to her enviroment.

I have a soft spot for this movie.  The acting from Anita Mui, Lawrence Ng and Andy Lau are all top notch.  The tragic life of Kawashima Yoshiko is also a companion piece to The Last Emperor.  During it's intial video release, the film has a different ending than the theatrical.  If you have seen both you can decide which one is more depressing.  When Ms. Anita Mui died a couple of years back not only did the Asian pop music scene lose a voice but the world lost a top notch actress who never really got her due.  Awesome movie that is given my highest recommendation possible!!!

We will miss Anita Mui.....",1122422400,2,1043,4.449735449735449
