6259143,5,B00ID75WUU,"Four great movies. I was really just looking to replace my VHS copies of Princess Bride and Ever After, but it was cheaper to buy this than single DVDs of those two movies.

6259146,2,B00ID75WUU,I order many movies on DVD and am especially fond of older movies and classics. When I saw this collection I couldn't wait. But I was very disappointed in the condition of the DVD The Princess Bride. It has irreparable damage and is unwatchable. The others are fine (as far as I can tell). I will have to think twice before ordering again.,1450051200,,339,4.396825396825397

8641084,4,B00ID75WUU,"Ordered this for The Princess Bride for my daughter (we already had Mirror, Mirror).  She enjoyed the movie very much and thought it was exciting and romantic.  Haven't watched Tristan and Isolde  yet and it's been awhile since we saw Ever After which I remember as a Cinderella story,  but the primary reason for getting this was The Princess Bride.",1476921600,,350,4.783333333333333
