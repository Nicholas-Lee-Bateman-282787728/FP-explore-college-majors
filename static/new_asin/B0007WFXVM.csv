8052795,5,B0007WFXVM,"I've always been a great fan of the NBA, and always loved those last few moments when victory is snatched in the face of defeat. At first, I thought this DVD (given the date of release) was only those buzzer-beaters from before the date of release. But to find the more recent buzzer-beaters on the disk as a bonus feature, as well as the amazing comeback from T-Mac against the Spurs (the final 2:35 that show how bad the Rockets were going, their miraculous comeback and the brilliance of McGrady) made this a complete experience for me. Buy it!!!",1151971200,3,549,4.555555555555555
8052796,4,B0007WFXVM,"I am the owner of a lot of basketball DVDs and this is one of my favorites. It is a collection of historic performances and incredible highlights; the bonus features are also entertaining. McGrady's 4th quarter exhibition was one of the top 5 highlights of the 2004-2005 season. Of course the Bulls, Lakers, and Celtics take part on this disc, but the playoff flashbacks serve as great nostalgia. If you are a basketball fan, this is definitely the DVD for you. It gets 4 1/2 stars from me.",1123545600,12,490,4.579545454545454
8052797,4,B0007WFXVM,"First of all i gotta give credit to Warner Home Video for releasing this DVD. This DVD is packed with good buzzer beaters. Also, watching all those highlights it's really exciting because now in days in the NBA you don't see exciting plays like those.  When MJ, Magic, Bird, Barkley, Isiah, Dominic, Drexler, etc. were playing that's when the NBA was exciting. Now you have all these young players getting money for nothing. In the early 90s there were competition, now in days is all about money. Well, back to the DVD, i gotta agree with a Reviewer name Daniel in the part that he stated that the T-Mac's plays were like 5 mins long. But overall, i recommend this DVD, i enjoyed it.",1122940800,5,684,4.516129032258065
8052798,4,B0007WFXVM,"This dvd'd ok. It has the original program in it, and some new features. Although I was a bit dissapointed as the new features, only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters, and the T.Mac ending goes for like 5 mins, and the quality isn't that great!",1120780800,7,257,4.375
8052799,5,B0007WFXVM,"On this DVD there is a more complete edition than old one (VHS of 1996). There are two bonus features:

- T-Mac unbeliavable threes Vs San Antonio in its entirety with TNT broadcast
- ""More finishes"": it's a bonus video with other incredible finishes with player of new NBA era like Derek Fisher, Wade, Kobe, A.I. , Shaq, Jason Kid, Garnett, Carter, Pierce, Walker, and many others.

Old video is also exciting, there are many stories of 90s like the great upset of houston rockets against orlando in '94 finals with 20 point of margin and the escalation of threes by Smith, a Bird story about injury and the game Vs Indiana. There's a part for MJ and his return to the NBA with his buzzers and many other stories.

What about the music? Yeah! Right music for the right moment.
This DVD is amazing. While you watch buzzers you can feel the tension of the moments and after the shoot...the energy of crowd explodes; adrenalina raise up since the beginning of buzzers. Pump up the volume and let it takes you inside the show!",1116979200,5,1023,4.518918918918919
8052800,5,B0007WFXVM,"This DVD is great, heck, it has the Nickel on the cover! Anyways, this DVD has a bonus feature of Mac's amazing three point flurry vs. San Antonio earlier this season - in its entirety, they used the TNT broadcast. A must have just for that alone!

It also has Franchise's game winner during opening night, Fisher's 0.4 shot, Wade's heroics, and of course the classic endings, like Rik Smit's buzzer beater vs. the Magic in 1995, Larry Bird's game-winners, and can't forget about the best one of them all, MJ's final shot in 1998. Another bonus feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from Horry, Carter, Iverson, and Marbury.",1116201600,11,630,4.675675675675675
