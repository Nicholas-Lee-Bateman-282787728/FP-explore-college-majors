Sounds like it was about a fire at these rich kids soda shop?Anyway the part that I HAD to record was near the end when Fred(?) sang a song coming down to the pool. As he is coming down he has really large visible pit stains on his shirt. He sings the entire song for about 3 minutes with these pit stains. Wouldnt someone on the set do or say anything about this? Then afterwards they breakout in a really exaggerated twist. For no reason. My kids and I watch this over and over and we are dying. I think this would be a great campy movie, Id seriously love to watch this whole thing. Its seems like a sweet cinematic disaster.",1528502400,,790,4.07051282051282

If you like good old black and white movies with alot of the old time music and dancing then this movie is for you, but also has a good story behind it. And no bad language.",1370995200,6,289,3.8333333333333335
