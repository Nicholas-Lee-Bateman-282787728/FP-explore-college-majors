Took me a while to get used to the dubbed dialogue but when you have men playing female parts, it's just common sense to have their dialog dubbed by women. But there are women in the movie too-- and one plays a teenage boy! With a mustache!
I ordered their previous flick before I'd even finished watching Mutantis.
Arguably the best movie of the 21st century, so far, at least.
Reminds me of the raunchy sci-fi action comedies made by Damon Foster but with a lot less action and a lot more sex.
A LOT more.
The only reason I rated it four outta five stars is because DVDs like this NEED audio commentary.
But still this one's a MUST HAVE for fans of wacky-tacky, el cheapo cinema.
And watch out for those downed power lines!
