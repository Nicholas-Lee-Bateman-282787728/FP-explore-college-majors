2043589,5,B0001Z3IKS,"this is the best show ever created and now its out on dvd and i couldn't be happier!  this is the story of Master Shake, Frylock, and MEATWAD, who is the funniest character.(Frylock is smart and has cool powers, Meatwad can morph into a hot dog or an igloo, and master shake is just an (...) who bosses the other two around and is a jerk to meatwad.)this show makes no sense and is completely random, so if you hate south park, family guy, and futerama, you will hate this but if you love those shows you will love this show!  I highly recommend it but kids under 13 probably shouldnt watch it.  ALL HAIL THE AQUA TEENS!!!",1090195200,3,622,4.254237288135593

8018519,1,B0001Z3IKS,"I love ATHF.  But you can get the same two seasons much cheaper buying them separately.

This goes on a lot on Amazon (and elsewhere).  You think you're getting a deal because items are bundled, but you actually
end up paying more. Buyer beware!",1300147200,,245,4.5227272727272725
8018520,4,B0001Z3IKS,This is a okay video if you are a young adult but it is not for me.  My kids love it and they are in their late teens and early 20's,1267056000,,132,3.2580645161290325

8018522,5,B0001Z3IKS,"I bought this box set as a gift.  I, myself, have seen the show and find it to be quite funny!  The person that received this gift just loved it!  I have also purchased the other box sets from ATHF.

My review for this will be short because there has been so much said here already.  Take it for what it is.  A cartoon show.  I know it was shown on ""Adult swim"" but it's still a cartoon show.  A funny one.  But that's all.

If you like to laugh.  These sets are pretty much a must.  It's a night of easy fun.  Hope you all enjoy not only the uniqueness of the show, but the characters as well.  You will want to see them all. (More than once)!",1200441600,8,644,3.891472868217054

8018524,5,B0001Z3IKS,"ATHF is genius.  If you ever had the chance to catch an episode on Cartoon Network and were a little curious, you should definetly purchase these DVDs.  I own all three seasons and love em.  Highly recommend.",1127433600,,208,4.5675675675675675
8018525,5,B0001Z3IKS,"Whether it is the opening segments with Dr. Weird or the strange ending credit sequence with Abe Lincoln, Aqua Teen Hunger Force will make your mind boggle as you try to wrap your mind around about twenty minutes of some of the most brilliant animation EVER!  I first found this while visiting a friend in Oregon.  Let's say that we were not thinking clearly when we put it in, but as the opening rap sequence began, all I could do was laugh.  The next morning, I thought perhaps it was just a fluke.  Nothing could be as funny as characters like Master Shake, Meatwad, Frylock, and my personal favorite Carl!  Boy, was I mistaken.

This series is hysterical.  Every episode is full of random events that will make you laugh so hard that you will pee your pants.  This show goes beyond the normal cartoon and takes humor to a whole new level.  I loved the fact that after the first two episodes the structure changed completely.  I don't think they ever solved any crimes, they just argued and dealt with random ""enemies"" that just happened to appear.  I even thought that just maybe they would loose their momentum after the first season, but yet again ... I was wrong.  The DVD was spectacular and gave a bit more information about the birth of these anti-heroes.

I come from a household without cable, even regular channels are snowed out, so when series like these are released on DVD it is the only opportunity I have to see them.  I will say that discovering this series was a high-point in my television on DVD career.  I love random chaos, and this is exactly what this show provided.

I would suggest this series to anyone that is a huge fan of social commentary coupled with fast food.  While it may not make you hungry, it surely will quench your desire for humor.  I still wonder where the writers found the idea for the ""cult"" characters the Mooninites.  Only on ATHF could this random thought become a reality.

I love this series and cannot wait for the third season!

8018526,5,B0001Z3IKS,"When I first watched this show on Adult Swim, I was like: What the F*CK is this! After a minute or two, I realized how incredibly stupid and sophmoric this show is. I have a childish sense of humor, so this show naturally appeals to me. I love it. But I think the best way to enjoy it is to get stoned and then watch it. You will laugh your a$$ off!",1091491200,13,349,3.861111111111111
