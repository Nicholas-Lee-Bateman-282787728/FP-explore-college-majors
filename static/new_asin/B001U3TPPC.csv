3796392,5,B001U3TPPC,This movie could easily be made into a video game.  It's packed with everything you need in an action film.,1367107200,,107,4.35
3796393,2,B001U3TPPC,"I get that the movie is parodying the whole yakuza/police drama but often the acting is stiff and the humor is just plain not funny. Maybe it just did not age well. The whole idea of broadcasting live a prisoner's release where gangs of yakuza await outside the police headquarters is classic but it is just so over the top. Also, the fact they have yakuza with swords is funny in that whole yakuza thinking they are modern-day samurai (and there are real incidents where swords have been used by the yakuza) but it's, to paraphrase Sean Connery in The Untouchables, like literally bringing a knife to a gunfight.

The soundtrack is this crazy jazz that is so catchy. Then there are these ridiculous song numbers at some sort of burlesque club that just do not fit.

Making the leader of the one yakuza actually impotent is a brilliant ploy by the scriptwriter but they do virtually nothing with that.

It is a B movie through and through and has its moments but overall it just doesn't date well. Plus the DVD release has zero on the movie itself (could they not have had some interview clips from the era or anything beyond stills from the flick?) and only has two trailers for other yakuza films.",1313798400,,1199,4.541666666666667
3796394,4,B001U3TPPC,This movie was cheesy and cool all at the same time.  Well worth the rental and time to watch.,1313107200,,94,3.9473684210526314
3796395,2,B001U3TPPC,"I thought I was gaining a yakuza screen gem.  Alas, It was a turd.  An enjoyable turd, as far as turds go....I was psyched when the film starts with a gun battle.  My eyebrow raised in suspicion when I noticed neither blood nor squibs from the 10 victims.  I said to myself, ""It's the late 60's, they were a tad squeamish on the blood...it'll still be violent.""  Boy, was I wrong.

Although visually stylish, it was pretty cheesey and mundane.  An annoying jazz-pop score bounced around as our star grimaced across the screen, looking more like a man with the runs than a man on.  Tajima is a freelance PI who wants in on the shady underdealings of the underworld.  Thus, he convinces the police to let him go undercover and work his way into this new mysterious gang.  He manages to find his way into their cool garage, complete with hatches and descending secret staircases...and that's it.  The rest of the film, the yakuza are suspicious to the point of overkill.  Any self-respecting mobster would have dumped his body long ago if they were that unsure of their new recruit's credibility. Throw in more faces of Tajima's incontinence and a mob moll who's  a virgin because her sugar daddy is impotent, a really cool machine gun that's really only used to shoot through concrete (as opposed to mobsters), 2 incompetent sidekicks,  and you get this.

I gave this 2 stars out of mercy.  I was expecting better fare, more along the lines of Kinji Fukasaku and Bunta Sugawara...but no.  I guess if you like that ""Tokyo Drifter"" garbage, you'll like this.  Don't be fooled and don't say I ain't warned you...",1265155200,2,1607,4.638297872340425

8342761,3,B001U3TPPC,"It's kind of refreshing to see something like this.  Just plot plot plot, not much character development or anything, and it doesn't quite take itself seriously, I could get behind that.  Really the best part of the movie is the scenery from Japan back when, as well as those now-classic Japanese cars. The least interesting cars in the movie is the main character's MG.",1442188800,2,370,4.765625

8342763,4,B001U3TPPC,"Rather than give you a plot summary that you could easily live without (not to mention the fact that Amazon has printed said summary above), I'll cut right to the chase:

Suzuki was beginning to hit his stride with 1963's 'Detective Bureau 2-3 Go To Hell Bastards'..

...and what a stride it was!

Shishido Jo is as tough and debonnaire as ever, pummeling his way through a seemingly endless stream of hoodlum warriors for a fair amount of the film's 89 minutes. No shortage of style here, either; Suzuki's signature frenetics are clearly blossoming right before our eyes. Not quite 'Branded To Kill' territory yet, but the road is clearly being paved. This is Suzuki at his pulpiest. Almost Roger Corman-esque, if Corman were less concerned with sheer exploitation and a little more savvy in regard to his visuals and overall aesthetic. It's difficult to compare something so utterly Japanese to something so uniquely - and absurdly - American. Regardless, a case can be made for such a comparison. Suzuki was putting his spin on the material he was given, as per usual - and much to the Nikkatsu studio head's dismay. (see Suzuki vs. Nikkatsu via Wikipedia)

If you're even considering this item, I assume you know of/are a fan of Seijun Suzuki. And if that's the case, if you've come this far, than I don't think you'll regret spending an hour and a half of your time in the hands of this director..

...and what glorious hands they are!",1439337600,2,1440,4.721115537848606

8342765,5,B001U3TPPC,"A well written noir-ish film with humor, and good use of  jazz music and camer work. An homage to the detective movies of the 40s and 50s. Very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",1411257600,,177,4.363636363636363
8342766,5,B001U3TPPC,Detective Bureau 2-3 is a masterpiece of campy action and is everything a hard-boiled detective movie should be.,1405123200,,112,5.277777777777778
8342767,3,B001U3TPPC,No redeeming qualities. Just interesting way to pass the time. I would watch it again. It's entertaining in it's own way.,1402790400,,121,4.809523809523809
