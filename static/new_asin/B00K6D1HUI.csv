6403179,5,B00K6D1HUI,"I won the Blu ray in a WDHA contest and I was at the Cinema Premier in New Brunswick. I was really blown away by the 3D Movie, with so much production and cool 3D visuals.  After watching the Blu Ray last night, I'm really blown away by this live concert film. This is one of the best concert's that I've ever seen. Axl is really at the top of his game and the band is electrifying. True Musicianship. The camera work, directing and editing is sensational and the concert flows nicely throughout.
Axl's energy is constant and his voice really sounds strong, along with an amazing audio mix. Bravo to the Producers for delivering GNR Fans an incredible long awaited new GNR product !",1403395200,6,682,4.456
6403180,5,B00K6D1HUI,"I've been a GNR fan since the mid 80's and have been to several live shows over the years and this show is just spectacular. The band is incredibly powerful and super tight and Axl's energy and rasp is constant from the beginning until the very end. The overall production, camera work and editing is just marvelous in so many ways, and the audio mix is unbelievably crystal clear and sounds  great on my home theater in 5.1 Surround.. It may have taken 25 year for a new GNR concert release, but this is a true treasure that I can watch for many years to come. ! It's time to buy a 3D TV !",1403222400,10,590,4.130434782608695

6403192,5,B00K6D1HUI,"WOW!!!!! I am a huge Guns n Roses fan so I might be a little biased. The show is pretty solid, but FAR from Guns n Roses in their prime. With that being said, this might be the best use of 3D that I have seen since the movie Gravity....maybe even better.

6403196,2,B00K6D1HUI,"The production quality is good, but the 3D is nowhere near as impressive as, say, Through the Never. Guys, the slo motion effect isn't nearly as cool as you think it is; don't use it after every song...and what was up with those cheesy animated fireworks during Welcome to the Jungle? Please.

I saw Axl live several year back when he was heavier and had the corn rows; and he kicked total ass. I left the show thinking, wow, he's still got it and back in his prime he must have been a force of nature to see live. Fast forward 10 years, and I couldn't even finish this DVD. He is a shell of his former self...too many accessories, tired dance moves, and his voice almost brought me to tears; it's bad.",1457654400,2,702,4.2781954887218046

6403208,4,B00K6D1HUI,"I enjoy the filming, I enjoy the set list, and overall, I pretty well enjoy the show.  What I find really distracting is a lot of times the recorded vocals do not match what Axl actually is doing on stage. For example he will have pulled his microphone away from his face and his vocals are still going.  I'm assuming there was some pretty heavy overdubbing done when the show was edited.",1440201600,,388,4.375

6403211,3,B00K6D1HUI,"A decent performance. I had expected worse. Axl Rose's time as a great rock singer is behind him. Good musicians though, but overall it is a laid-back version of GnR. It lacks the nerve and energy that once was a GnR trademark. If Axl had problems with his voice years ago in the original GnR, it have not improved. Quite the opposite. Long periods without Axl singing. And when he does, it's just a shadow of what it used to be.",1438905600,,429,4.308641975308642
6403212,5,B00K6D1HUI,"This is a great DVD! What sets it apart is that it is done the way a concert film should be done-just the concert without interruptions with interviews and other meaningless material. With this DVD, you can sit back and watch what appears to be a start to finish concert the way you would see it if you were actually there. With a concert running time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes, you don't feel as if you are watching a heavily-edited concert with missing material. Since they don't break up the show with other material as many concert DVD's do, you get the full build up of excitement as the show progresses!
The use of 3D is very good, somewhat similar to what was done on the U2 3D film (I wish they would release that one in 3D blu ray). Axl's voice is very strong, and video and music quality are great. Buy this one!",1436918400,3,828,4.246835443037975

6403215,5,B00K6D1HUI,"Simply the best GNR show that was ever put together, the band is excellent (3 guitar players), they reproduce the songs as close as possible to their original versions, Axl was able to sing them properly, nobody is being missed in this line up. Highly recommended.",1433980800,,264,4.760869565217392
6403216,4,B00K6D1HUI,"Surprisingly enjoyable. The band sounds great and aren't playing to a CD. Many angles. Most 3D concerts I see have about 2 camera angles, this had loads.

6403222,5,B00K6D1HUI,"A great buy for any Gn'R fan. I was fortunate enough to be at one of these shows in Vegas when Izzy showed up and unfortunately those songs didn't make it into the BluRay, but if you're interested in watching a packed Guns n' Roses setlist in beautiful high def, this is for you. You can read my live review of the show I attended for an idea of the energy of this recording: http://www.examiner.com/review/guns-n-roses-finish-on-the-top-at-las-vegas-residency

Other people may criticize Axl or his new hired Guns, but let the past go. Slash is out being Slash, and Axl still puts on one of the best shows in rock n' roll. He's somehow hitting notes that men half his age can't approach, and his guitarists absolutely shred the sh*t out of your favorite songs like It's So Easy, You Could Be Mine, Estranged and of course Paradise City. The stripper eye candy in the background of some songs is a nice bonus too.

A colleague at work who is an old school GnR fan claimed to have seen a modern-era Axl recording on VH1 and said he thought Axl sounded awful and the band sucked. I bought him this BluRay and he came over 2 days later to apologize and swore he would be at the next live concert that comes around. I don't think you should need any more reason than that to buy this disc.",1427241600,3,1285,4.463829787234043

Obviously, Axl's voice isn't what it was 20 years ago. Duh. But I think he puts on a great performance. One of the best live DVD's i've purchased.",1422748800,,177,4.53125

6403235,1,B00K6D1HUI,Axl has become so engorged with himself its sad. As for the best guitar player for GnR. Slash is. I seen them in 89 in Fl. That was a great show. People nowadays will never enjoy this band for what it used to be. 3D? Just go to a show. Thats the real 3D.,1421884800,,254,3.7222222222222223

6403237,5,B00K6D1HUI,Outstanding performance by GnR. Axl can still hit the high notes. Hes actually a little shaky when his voice is lower but overall a very good performance. They played all the classic songs and the good ones off Chinese Democracy. Ashba Thrall and Fortus are great on guitar and don't miss a beat. l thought it was as good as the original show I saw in the early 90s with Slash Izzy and Duff.,1420934400,,391,4.297297297297297
6403238,3,B00K6D1HUI,It's just not the same guns. Good show but not the same. Get back with all the original members and you will make millions again.,1419984000,,129,4.2
6403239,1,B00K6D1HUI,I COULD NOT WATCH IN FULL THIS DVD CONCERT BECAUSE THE DVD HAD A FAILURE. SEVERAL SONGS THE AUDIO WENT OFF AND THE VIDEO HAD SLOWER MOTION. SO I CANNOT MAKE A REVIEW UNTIL I RECEIVE A GOOD QUAITY ITEM.,1419984000,,201,4.05
6403241,2,B00K6D1HUI,Axl Rose should be ashamed about the result of this Disc. Horrible voic fixed by pro-tolls. That was  my perception.,1419984000,,116,4.8
6403242,5,B00K6D1HUI,Go get this if you ever loved GNR. Axle is just ON TOP OF HIS GAME - what a icon! And the band here is insanely talented. The production of the video/audio is amazing and not too much of the 2 second per frame dizzy camera baloney. This is perhaps the best concert DVD I own. Guns are not my favorite band but this DVD reminds me of why their music is timeless. I own 50+ rock/hard rock/metal DVD concerts. It's one of those I would pay 5X as much to replace if it were not available. Go get it. You will be very happy. The three guitar attack is a beautiful thing to behold. All three guitar players are so unique and SO talented as performers -not just as musicians. A STELLAR effort.,1419811200,2,686,4.126865671641791
6403243,5,B00K6D1HUI,Husband was disappointed he couldn't go to Vegas to see them live. He loved the video,1419811200,,85,4.375
6403245,3,B00K6D1HUI,"It's ok.  It's GNR.  Axl will always be GNR. His voice isn't what used to be, but most of the time makes you travel back in time to 1989-1994. What i can't believe is that the drummer was wrong on the intro of ""You could be mine"".

I don't give 5 stars because of this: I bought this when the GNR Facebook talked about it, so i got it on July 8th 2014. Months later, they sell the same Blu-ray, with 2 cd's of the concert, and a t-shirt.  I wouldn't buy the one i got. I would had buy this : http://www.amazon.com/Appetite-For-Democracy-3D-Casino/dp/B00NJADEVA/ref=pd_cp_mov_1",1419552000,2,576,4.563106796116505

6403248,5,B00K6D1HUI,"Visually, this concert is awesome!  The 3D is sharp, colorful and bright and so realistic It felt like I was there. The current band members have duplicated the sound of early Guns n Roses hits. Only now the audio is even better in DTS - HD Master Audio 5.1.  The concert has 8 songs new to live video and 15 Classic GNR songs.... A Total of 25 songs with a  run time of 2 hrs. 43 min. A 2D and a Stereo option is also included.

The concert was filmed at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas. No expense was spared in delivering a first class show with excellent lighting effects, projection screens, fireworks and 8 gorgeous pole and stage Vegas style dancers! The show really rocks and the audience clearly and loudly expresses their appreciation.

W. Axl Rose still delivers a great show, but like some older singers, his voice can't match the highs, screams and excitement of his youth. I still consider this the best live music concert video in my collection and highly recommend this 3D Blu-ray.

This is a Blu-ray I will enjoy over and over again. The concert is like a party in a box so Guns n' Roses will also be performing at my next party for all to enjoy.",1418688000,8,1158,4.337962962962963

6403261,2,B00K6D1HUI,"this is not GnR it's axel rose band! back in the day I wasn't even a fan of their but they had guts in their dirty LA metal sound enough to say I can listen to this but I'd rather hear metallica or slayer. this is a joke the way perple now a day keep playing under a band name but it's been 20 years and only 1 is an original band member and one was there in their career high point. I can't see how any of these 3! guitar players can have pride to have filled slash's and izzy's or gilbert shoes there was 2 now they need 3 guitarist to smear the bands name and axel can't sing nothing like before the only danger in this band  is will Axels voice destroy every song tonight or just half the songs.
why do the original members(slash,izzy stradlin,duff play shows with Axel still here and there-Axel fired them and forced them to give up the rights to the music and name,-matt sorum and gilbey clark refuse to that I respect(fire me - Fu)they got the least money ,credit and respect from the GnR experience for a couple years I'd think they might be the first to go i'll play for low pay but that not the case.
anyway this band is a C- grade GnR band and Axels about a D- singer and it shows everywhere but he only wants the money and fame. I bought the Chinese democracy cd for $2.00 just to hear it and I sold it to some poor sapp for $5  just like this by low and sell high or better yet don't buy it because it's and insult to music and the old school fans.",1415404800,2,1461,4.0

I didn't know Chinese Democracy but I considered it an ok sounding appetizer.  Dancing girls were a little misplaced, but then again it was a GnR show.

6403282,2,B00K6D1HUI,"Where's Slash?  I miss Duff too.  It's nice to have a bluray release of GnR music but the energy of old line-up just isn't there.  Axl is great to watch live but he seems to run off stage a lot, like he's only there for work and not the music.  And as much as I love long guitar solos, they've added many but they seem drawn out generic ones with no soul, maybe just there to give Axle a break. They kill the flow of the concert and are nothing like Slash would perform. Overall, I would much rather have a re-mastered older concert with the original line-up but this is better than nothing.  Lastly this should be titled the Axl Rose band- kind of like the Jerry Garcia band was called.",1411344000,2,687,4.174242424242424

Yes, we all know what good songwriters the original members were, but I must say the ""new and improved"" version is just that. I think these guys are some amazing rock players. This band is polished, professional,  and talented. I'm assuming the management looked far and wide to hand pick the best talent out there.

6403335,2,B00K6D1HUI,"I bought this Blu-ray out of curiosity, as I have not seen the current GNR lineup perform in person, only on YouTube, and I wanted to give them a fair shot.
I did not enjoy this video, and I was not able to make it to the very end. It just wasn't my cup of tea.
Axl Rose looks and sounds very strange. His voice sounds bad. He looks old, confused, sweaty and winded. The band is weird and everything is so campy and overblown. ...And fake. The stage production is really cheesy, and just too much. Well, I guess it is Vegas?
There are 3 guitarists who all play different styles, and 3 keyboard players including Axl Rose. There are pole dancers and multiple pyrotechnic explosions, but on the whole, this concert is sadly lacking the attitude and swagger that made Guns N' Roses famous.
This video really is a disservice to the band Guns N' Roses.
It is a long, tiring, and mechanical performance.
Considering the lack of releases from the classic lineup, it's very strange that this particular show was recorded and packaged for sale.
Surely, they could release a performance from the band's heyday. Why on Earth did they choose this particular era and show?
Will be selling my barely used Blu-Ray on the net.",1407196800,3,1210,4.529680365296803
6403336,3,B00K6D1HUI,"As a longtime GnR fan who saw the group perform in their heyday,  I was curious to see what the current incarnation of Axl and his traveling all-star circus would sound like.  To be honest, I wanted to absolutely hate this dvd/concert.  However, it's pretty good.

The production values are impressive, the concert was shot extremely well.  The band still maintains that larger than life image with Axl playing the piano raised over the crowd, the pyrotechnics and guitarists playing high above the crowd on either side of the stage.  For the hardcore guitarist - the trio of Ron Thal, DJ Ashba and Richard Fortus shine on all of the songs.  I thought Ron was particularly impressive with his soloing on a number of favorites.

The band does a good job covering the material from Appetite and the Use Your Illusion albums.  What surprised me the most was how well the material from Chinese Democracy sounded when played live (I was not a huge fan of that album).  The band took breaks during the show to showcase each guitarist with a brief solo - each very unique to the individual musician.

I thought the songs were somewhat overproduced,  especially the Appetite tunes which were obviously a bit more stripped down when first recorded.

This is a decent concert to see - for those who are curious to see what Axl has done since the rest of their group went their separate ways.  Appetite for Democracy reminds me of a KISS concert today.  They can have the same name, play the old tunes and even wear the makeup but it's not Slash, Izzy, Duff and Steve/Matt.  It just doesn't quite sound the same to me.",1407196800,3,1607,4.605633802816901

6403350,1,B00K6D1HUI,"I usually don't write reviews... unless it is totally necessary. And I think this DVD deserves some few lines.

First of all, I will not warn you not to get this DVD. If you are a fan like I am, you will buy it anyway, regardless bad reviews. But don't be misled by the awesome cover... what matters is on the inside.

Second of all, if you own and love the Tokio concert DVDs, you will appreciate them much more after watching this. When you play this Vegas concert you will feel urged to switching to the Tokio concerts almost immediately. This Vegas concert just feels awkward from start to finish. Starting with Axl. What the hell his clothes? Why that awful appearance? He just looks like he is burning inside and sweating like crazy all covered in those ragged jeans... come on man... loosen up a bit. I loved the time when Axl felt so free that he wore very short pants and barely a t-shirt, and he was all free to run all across the stage. Well those days are gone. As sad as it sounds. Axl no longer runs, barely dances and his voice sounds very weird. And his hat... that is like the worst part. It's ok (I guess) to use a fancy hat for the beginning of a song like Knockin' On Heaven's Door, but when you have to use it the whole show, it bites. Big time. It looks ridiculous. Clearly Axl is out of shape and he cannot go back to his old days of short pans and t-shirts, and maybe you think that this does not matter as long as the music is flawless. Well, not only stage presence matters a lot... the music for this show is definitely NOT what you expect.

I really don't know if Axl's voice was pre-recorded for these shows but the sound is pretty weird here. Like you don't know whether there is dubbing or if he has any special computer program backing him up... what it's pretty obvious is that something is going on in the background and it's very notorious. You'll notice it right from the beginning. Still, I do admire Axl's courage and determination. You need to have balls to do what he does when you are in your 50's. So kudos to him for that.

The band is just weird. It's not the same thing to gather some good session musicians to record Chinese Democracy in the solitude and privacy of a recording studio than having these random musicians playing a live gig where soul, chemistry and charisma is a MUST. It just feels awkward listening to the classics played by this bunch of freaks. Seriously. Even when Guns N' Roses' music is not the most difficult to play, all their albums are enjoyable gems. It's very good music. But once you listen to the first four tracks in 'Appetite for Democracy' you get the feeling that these guys were all session musicians who were pulled out of their studios to play a show. You can't feel their souls at all. It's like they don't really care for the music but their paycheck alone. When you see Duff, Matt and Slash playing together and enjoying the music, such good vibe is definitely transmitted to you and you love the songs and get inspired and energized. But these guys here... naaahhh. It looks like they try so hard to get loved by the audience... but they simply don't have what it takes. To start off... why 3 guitar players? In the Tokio shows, Gilby Clarke barely did anything... because Slash was almost enough to bring soul to the music. I don't know the names of these guitar players other than this awful ""DJ Ashba"" but it does not matter. None of them is remarkable. Why DJ Ashba? What's his music background? Is he a DJ of electronic music or something? Seriously? Well that's the lamest nickname for a guitar player, EVER.

The drummer is in my opinion not only the worst possible drummer Axl could find (which is weird considering Axl is pretty demanding about the quality of his musician's) but also he holds down the whole band. His playing sucks. I am an amateur drummer myself and I I could definitely play the whole set much better than him. Big time. God, how I miss Matt Sorum !!! Yes... I know most people prefer Steven Adler over Matt, but Matt is a very skilled, technical drummer. He manages the tempos perfectly. He plays the songs just right. He maintains the rhythm of the songs in either long or short lengths. But this atrocious drummer (think his name is Frank Ferrer) is just a DISASTER. He is able to maintain a state of awkwardness throughout the whole show. It's unbelievable. You are just wondering which part he is going to blow up next. There are at least ten times where you can listen clearly that the guy ruined the songs by getting lost. It's just amazing. At times I felt that Axl was going to stop the show just for him.

Another annoying thing (besides this awful drummer) in this show are the pole dancing girls. Seriously, what need there is for this? It's like, if the show is not appealing enough, then you have the girls moving their booty so you can be amused like you were a lone man stuck in a night club. I don't see what function these girls have other than making this show a collective mess. There were barely dressed up girls in the Tokio show yes, but at least they played the sax and the trumpet. Not that they were any virtuous, but at least they played music. In Move To The City they even soloed. But the girls in here look like strippers. This is supposed to be a rock and roll concert, not a strip club.

In all, the only feeling you get after watching this show is a confirmation of something that all of us GNR fans DON'T want to accept: our good old hard rock band from the 80's and 90's is long gone. The skilled Slash guitars, the tremendously good Duff bass jamming and the synchronized Matt Sorum's beats are no more in GNR. Forget about it. What we have nowadays is a band of willing musicians but yet lame performers. As someone else wrote in another review, it's like watching a cover band, and nothing more than that. A lot of things MUST be changed in this band in order to emulate the golden years of GNR. But I believe not even Axl wants to run the extra mile anymore. I think he just wants to make some money out of this... naturally, the guy needs to make a living like all of us.

I think our future with this band is to expect a couple more decent albums before Axl finally decides to give up. Chinese Democracy is not my favorite definitely but it's not that bad. It has its moments. But as far as live shows is concerned... the old band was MUCH BETTER.",1406851200,11,6405,4.349498327759197

6403355,4,B00K6D1HUI,"Obviously, this Blu-Ray DVD is NOT for all of you Slash fans. If you are expecting the circa 1980's Guns N' Roses, get a grip! Other than Axl Rose and Dizzy Reed, you are not going to see any of the original band. What you will see is an excellent group of musicians that Axl has put together, including Bumblefoot and DJ Ashba, who play their collective arses off for this performance.

As for Axl's voice, it definitely isn't what it used to be. The same can be said of pretty much all of my favourite lead singers that have lasted this long though. Honestly, if you compare his voice 30+ years later to the likes of Geddy Lee, David Lee Roth, Robert Plant, Roger Waters or even Ozzy, you will find that NO ONE can hit the same high notes they did when they were in their 20's. That's just the human condition. Expect his vocals to be 30+ years worse for wear and you will not be disappointed. Expecting him to sound like he is 20-something is simply not realistic. I find it impressive that he can still remember all the lyrics without a teleprompter after these many years. A lot of lead singers his age couldn't live without their lyrics being spoon-fed to them via a video screen.

As for the reviewers who complain about music being out of sync with the video, there is a pretty simple explanation. Most people have VERY cheaply constructed Blu-Ray players. If you do not have an at least 12x Blu-Ray drive, you have no basis to form an accurate opinion of this product. Your hardware simply can not keep up with the rate that the data is encoded at. If you are running an 8x Blu-Ray drive on a typical PC, count yourself lucky that you can even hear the audio! If you have a BR Player that cost less than $75, you will probably also suffer from sub-standard playback. You get what you pay for.

I do not have a 3D Blu-Ray Player, so I can not comment on the 3D quality. The 2D quality is right on though. If you aren't getting good audio/video, get better gear. This recording really pushes BR to its limits, insofar as hardware requirements for adequate playback. You can't blame GNR for that. Buy quality gear and you will get quality playback.

This was a great set and was captured beautifully. Honestly, I could live without the Vegas strippers and ""acrobats"". They are just a distraction from the music as are some of the cheesy special effects. All I care about is the the music, and I was not disappointed. I only wish I had been there. This is as close as you are going to get to a time machine back to the original concert though.",1406678400,2,2548,4.3691983122362865

6403357,5,B00K6D1HUI,"I went to see them play on May 31st at the Hard Rock in Vegas, just about 2 months ago.  We got a special treat that night with Duff joining the line up instead of Stinson who was at another gig.  The band blew the roof off the place in my opinion, it was a phenomenal show that lasted almost 3 hours - they sounded amazing and I would definitely see them again there or anywhere else.  The live experience is so much more amazing compared to a video, but having this helps relive the memories of the concert.  Hard to relate the feelings of several thousand fans all having a great time and singing along to the songs.

Once I heard that they were putting out a DVD / Blu-Ray of the show at the Hard Rock - it was a no brainer to buy it.  I've watched it several times already and even have a copy of it on my phone so that I can listen to it in my car.

Too many people are complaining that Axl doesn't have the voice he had 20 years ago, and the band isn't the same without all the old members - they have the right to their opinions, but obviously a lot of people disagree with them.  Watch this for what it's worth - it was very well done - the camera work, the sound, the songs all make for a very memorable night.  I wish that I had been there for that evenings concert - what an amazing thing that would have been to have a professionally done video of a concert that I had been at.",1406592000,,1390,3.971223021582734

6403375,5,B00K6D1HUI,"I'm a big fan of Guns N' Roses, both the original best known line-up, as well as the current one.

As I've never actually been to one of their concerts (yet), I was afraid that Axl would not be able to match his incredible voice, but even though he's now older, and given the fact that he moves around on the stage a lot, his voice is very much still there.

His voice gets the biggest star of my review, but there are several other things I love about this concert film:

- The length - it's over 2.5 hours long.

- The band - Axl has picked some extremely talented musicians.

- The songs - A good mix of the ""oldies"", the new, and some covers.

- The add-on's - Most of the band members get to shine with either their own music or something they've chosen to play.

The only thing I would put under CONS, is that I wasn't THERE!!!! :-D

As a guitar player, some things that was icing on the cake was Bumblefoot's intro to Don't Cry, Richard's intro to Knocking on Heaven's Door, Dizzy's intro to Zeppelin's No Quarter, and Bumblefoot & Richard's intro to Patience.

Awesome DVD. I am so happy I pre-ordered it and got it as soon as possible.

What a disappointment guys, where did they come with the idea of those really medriocre, and not even hot, go-go pole dancers? Was that a rock concert or a go-go ""corner on the hood"" bar show???? Not only that guy image is a way off, after all ""the good life"", but also, no interaction with the audience, and the dresser must be out of their mind: a cowboy hat, really??? Country music???...
The music even while not completelly bad versions of the old days, tell you nothing about the Appetite or any other album...I fall asleep two times watching the concert, they included all hits, and even though, they show me absolutelly nothing, even they had the nerve of playing a Pink Floyd version while using a flying and mediocre played piano over the audience in another of the acrobatic parts (concept that is not even new, Emerson did the piano show, and even better on the 70's, but hey, he was Emerson, and a show was a real plus)...
Guys this is coming with a guy that owns over 200 concerts from all imaginable bands, good, and others not so good, where the hell was that awesome Tokyo show???
BTW I do not care for how long that band has been playing, they need the old feeling back, sorry...

You will not be disappointed.",1405123200,,370,4.068493150684931
6403383,5,B00K6D1HUI,"Awesome concert. I'm not even a huge GNR fan (I I go way back to the NWOBHM days with Priest, Maiden, Tank, Raven, UFO, Thin Lizzy Etc... ) when GNR came out in the late 80's I sneered at their style of play (along with LA Guns, etc..) and gravitated to the more melodic and dark metal like Sabbath, Dio and the aforementioned bands. That said, being a musician and loving music in general, I always had them in my rotation of CD's and appreciated the raw energy and skills that AXL and the boys created..... Being a guitar player, Slash hooked me from the get go. So, was I skeptical when he left GNR? You better believe it.
In fact, I haven't paid much attention to these guys (both the AXL side and the Slash side) since Use Your Illusion.
I was simply looking for a cool 3D concert Blu Ray to use on my 3D big screen that's collecting dust. I bought my TV for the PQ and the 3D was an extra feature that was simply included with the TV.... When I saw this was coming out I simply took a chance and purchased.
 The package arrived in 2 days in perfect size package and was flawless as would be expected with a brand new DVD.  I popped it in the player and cranked my theater system up not really thinking much about it other than I was hoping for a good quality sound and an interesting 3D experience. Wow! What a great quality production... The sound is clear and well balanced with each musicians instruments sound levels nicely leveled and crisp. The PQ is perfect and colors vivid and true (with a tendency toward blue hues - for effect I would think). Most importantly, the camera work is very well done. One thing that I have noticed in today's day and age with music DVDs of live performances is that there seems to be this propensity to produce everything with a fast pace. By fast pace I mean the camera work on many dvd's switches frames way too fast and way to often, never seeming to stay focused on any one object longer than 2 seconds. Maybe I am in the minority here, but I can't stand it. I like to actually watch the musician play his instrument. It's part of why I buy the live DVD. If I wanted to see a fast action music video I would put on VH1 classic or whatever... So I was really happy to have a concert video that at least put a little effort into slowing things down so I could actually see the chords Bumblefoot plays or the fact that AXL really is lip syncing.. Lol. That said, their is a pretty fair share of ""doctoring"" up the sound track (which I believe is going to happen on 99.8 percent of live dvd's) as you can clearly see in several sections of the video that his voice isn't matching the mouth. Don't get me wrong, he sounds surprisingly good at this stage of the game and this is evidenced many times throughout in areas that don't seem to be over dubbed. Overall, the band that he put around him is extremely talented.. dare I say more talented than the original line up!? I would say most likely. Again,
I love Slash, but this is clearly AXL's band and he really hasn't lost much without Slash. I mean this from a performance stand point ... From a creativity or songwriting standpoint is a whole different debate.
Oh, and not to forget the 3D, it's pretty cool and not too overpowering. And I am fine with that because it reminded me that at the end of the day the 3D is more a gimmick to me and the music performance is what I really care for!
I rank this as a solid investment for ANYONES blu ray collection. . . .
Purchase it with confidence.",1405036800,5,3490,4.238738738738738
6403394,2,B00K6D1HUI,"I really don't know what the other reviewers were watching. Yes the production of the concert was great....the video quality and audio were not the issue. First thing is first, many gave negative opinions on Vince Neil performing due to his weight he put on. Well, Mr. Rose is in the same boat. The man needs to lose some weight, he got fat and it's effecting his performance. Then we have a Nikki Sixx wanna be on bass and a complete Izzy Strandlin knockoff on the guit. The lead guitarist and the drummer aren't GNR quality. When Velvet Revolver were around, Scott Weiland and them were doing the GNR songs better than what we see here. I'll give two stars mainly all due to the video and audio quality. You want a five star concert blu-ray, go get Def Leppard' viva hysteria. They put on a classic performance for their age.",1405036800,8,827,4.483443708609271
6403395,4,B00K6D1HUI,"Yes yes yes, we all know this isn't the same Gun N Roses.  We know Axl has a whole new band.  Its time to get OVER it.  If you don't like the new band and the new music, theres nothing wrong with your opinion.  Its your opinion.  But if your opinion ONLY boils down to Its not the same band, then where have you been in the last decade?

Unfortunately, I do find myself having to defend rather than praise, and that really isn't the most positive way to review this.  But people need to understand what this Blu-ray is:  This is GnR PUTTING ON A SHOW.  You watch this blu-ray for the spectacle of GnR in Vegas.  Pyro!  Pole Dancers!  Axl and DJ and Bumblefoot running from one side of the stage to the other!  Musically, the band members truly are gifted musicians and their chops more than make up for Axls voice.  Now, do we detect some sort of vocal effect on Axls mic on a couple of songs?  Yeah so?  This is the GnR VEGAS act at least hes actually trying to sing, unlike some other cruddy pop stars who go to Vegas to lip sync their way through 5 shows a week!

I happen to enjoy the Chinese Democracy album as well, and its nice to see them perform the newer songs between the classics (though I do wish they had played Oh My God).  Also, uncredited on the back of the blu-ray or on Amazon, but actually credited in the booklet that comes w/ the Blu-ray, Dizzy Reeds spotlight moment is playing Led Zeppelins No Quarter on piano and he does a fine rendition of it.  I wasn't overwhelmed by the concert itself, it is what it is and even the most hardcore fan has to go into this with expectations a little low.  As I stated, the film is about the spectacle.  Good concert films tend to focus on the skills when Jimmy Page is playing that blistering solo, they tend to close up and never cut away from his hands because the director knows at that moment, everyone watching needs to be awed by his skill.  That type of focus is lost here in Appetite for Democracy.  Theres several moments where I thought, Gee, I sure would like to see Bumblefoot play that lick while the film is showing you a gimmicky 3D shot of the drummer instead.

Interestingly enough, I own a 3D television (sometimes I forget because 3D in of itself is pretty useless; suffice to say I did NOT buy the TV for its 3D options).  Despite my distaste for 3D (did I mention how useless it is?), I donned my glasses (oh hey, the batteries are still good imagine that)  to watch this concert in 3D and. Yeah. Ok.  Sure.  Whatever.  I mean, its like watching a paper cut-out of Axl moving around in front of the stage.  Do people who defend 3D really think thats amazing or mind-blowing?  Oh, a few times Bumblefoot aims the headstock of his guitar at the camera.  Ok.  And theres this angle of the drums where the cymbals are popping out with the drummer behind them.  Cool I guess.  Having this in 3D is more about >bragging< that you can watch it in 3D.  Truth of the matter is if you sit your friends down and force them to watch this in 3D, they're probably going to be superbly underwhelmed.

Who should buy or watch this?  Insane fans who ALSO like Chinese Democracy and are ok that Slash is not up on the stage with Axl  (Yes, that would be me).  I give it 4 stars, in reality a forgiving casual fan would probably rate it 3 and those who just cant take (who shouldnt watch in the first place) will just trash it.",1405036800,4,3390,4.227769110764431

6403397,5,B00K6D1HUI,"You're thinking ""GNR sucks cause Slash isn't in GNR anymore."" 20 years later I don't even care. And really, if that's your biggest complaint about this DVD and/or Chinese Democracy, then why are you even looking at it!?

Appetite for Democracy DVD shows up in the mail today. GNFNRS. I almost cried. Okay, I cried, so what, I'm a pansy. And I still buy DVD's. And CD's. I'm out of date. One of my friends told me that Led Zeppelin is the band that he judges all other bands by. Mine was Guns N' Roses. Today proves that it still is. When I hear a cover tune, is it as good as Guns' version of ""knockin on heavens door"" or ""human being"" or ""black leather"" ... is a band's second guitar player as cool as Izzy, do the 2 guitar players weave like Slash and Izzy. Is the band's debut as insane as AFD? Is their follow-up as epic as Illusion? Were their replacements as cool as Matt & Gilby, and Was their implosion as devastating to the world of rock as GNR's? Usually not. So whatever... GNR was THAT good, let's get on with the DVD.

I put that disc in the DVD player. I don't own a blue ray. I turn on both sound systems, and I turn it up. I hit play, and the world just effed off for three hours. Dang. Guns N' Roses. Axl is bad. And by bad, I mean ""he bad"". Like sick or ill or the other words that are bad but then mean good in a slang sense. Dude, can you sing those songs? No, so shut up. Nobody else can.

I had an ex-girlfriend go with me to see a GNR tribute band once, like 10 years ago, and I was stoked. They had wigs, it was lame, the drummer had the most un-sorum/adler hair I've ever seen. The duff didn't look much like duff.  The izzy had a wig so cheap that it didn't look a thing like hair. Fake Slash looked and played good until his wig fell off. And the Axl did okay, but he didn't tear the place down like Axl in 87, or Axl in 92, or even Axl in 2002 or today, but still... half the time a tribute band's the closest thing you get to any band. I saw Velvet Revolver on the Contraband tour almost 10 years ago, and they were good, very good... but ... it lacked Axl and Izzy. ""Axl's voice is blown out, it's gone."" No it's not, he's not 25 or 30 anymore. Name one singer who sings at 50 like he used to. It's hard to do. Axl does great in this DVD.

Speakin' of the band, Axl definitely knows how to pick `em. The 3 guitar players nail the ""classic"" tone. But still, as a band... Fortus, Ashba, and Ferrer are covered in goofy lookin tattoos like it makes them cool. It doesn't. You can't buy cool. Lame. The first dude to ever have sleeves was original and cool for it. Ozzy was cool cause his knuckles had his name, the first chick to ever get angel wings on her back or a tramp-stamp, they were original. Everyone after was a copy cat. Be cool for what you do. Fortus is cool cause he has a cool nose and he looks like a mix between Ron Wood and Izzy. That makes anyone look cool. Ferrer does well with both the Adler swing and the Sorum tom-fills, so he's cool. DJ Ashba tries to hard. ""Hey look I look like Slash, no wait, I look like Nikki Sixx"" ... lame. He was totally cool in Beautiful Creatures, now he's just a parody. Tommy Stinson was in the Replacements, so he doesn't need to prove anything. His bass tone is nothing like Duff's, but he's Tommy Stinson. He lives in no one's shadow. Face it. Bands like the Replacements influenced guys like Duff. Bumblefoot's got a cool Rick Nielsen braided beard thingy. And he plays his own guitars, not ""what Slash played for the sake of playing like Slash"". That's what makes him cool. Chris Pitman? Do we really need two ""keyboardists/percussionists""... I don't know what he adds, I'm sure it's gotta be something, but I personally don't see it. 3 guitar players seems a bit weird, cause they only need 2.

I miss Izzy is about all I could think of that was wrong with this DVD. That, and I need a bigger TV. 32 inches doesn't rock hard enough for this one. Izzy really added something to the band. Duff was cool, hell all the guys were cool, but Izzy wrote all the songs and had the Johnny Thunders swagger.

The DVD is well shot, well mixed, well edited, top notch.  The set list is great. I know the opener is a newer song and therefore ""inferior"" in the eyes of old-school GNR fans, but it's a solid tune and set opener. The band hits those first few tunes like a freight train (or night train?!). The band solos are mediocre to acceptable, but not a highlight. Don't Cry has always been one of my favorite GNR tunes, and the two covers were cool to see.  The interviews are okay, but only with 4 members of a 8-member band. That's half. I ordered this DVD assuming it'd be a solid 3-star effort, and was pleasantly surprised by how a year-and-a-half old show by my ""old"" favorite band, featuring all ""new"" members ... could both make me feel like a kid again (the nostalgia) and hopeful for the future (the band is tight, and let's face it... the old lineup isn't gonna magically put itself back together). I can't only give it four stars, it's very good... it's amazing.

Ever since Axl's ""new"" GNR started performing in 2001, I've hoped for a live album or video. With dudes like Tommy and Dizzy ... and even NIN's Robin Finck, Primus' Bryan Mantia, and Josh Freese having been in the band, it couldn't have been all bad. I mean, I have ""Live Era"" CD and the Tokyo 92 DVD's ... and a VHS of their Rio 91 show and a dvd transfer or a vhs of the MTV New York 88 show, all of which I'd treasured as a GNR fan, and the original dudes were amazing, but here it is. I am unspeakably surprised this DVD was ever even released. Thank you Axl. Thank you. I had low expectations, and it blew me away.

6403399,5,B00K6D1HUI,"What an Amazing Blu-ray disc: 16 of their most iconic songs, and a handful of their newer stuff, and a few surprises thrown in.

The quality of the Blu-ray version is stunning, and the sound is literally mind-blowing. I don't think I've heard any Blu-ray music as perfectly engineered as this one. You can literally hear EACH and every one of the 3 guitarists, the bass, Dizzy's keyboards, and the booming drums.

And then there's Axl. It seems as the years go by he has finally realized his gift of his singing abilities, and now he has really honed it and treated it right. No more sounding coarse and wear and tear as the concert goes on. His last song is just as powerful as his first. His vocal range is truly amazing, and now he knows how to treat it right so that it continues to sound amazing throughout. I was really surprised and pleasantly shocked how much better he sounds now than when he was in his 20s - it is truly quite astonishing.

The set list is awesome. Each and every of those songs deserves to be there, even the newer material. You can debate a few are missing, such as ""My Michelle, Double Talkin' Jive, Don't Damn Me, Shotgun Blues"" etc. also deserved to be on there, but hey, you can't complain much when there are 25 songs - many other concerts have half as much.

This is definitely a collector's item of GnR fans, and for those who want to introduce new fans to Gn'R. There is very little adult language, and besides pole dancers and dancers in lingerie, the content is family-safe.
I am so happy I was able to get this concert, that I just purchased a second copy to save for the future. If you are a Gn'R fan, or want to try it, this is a must-have concert.

That said I did happen to catch this show in Las Vegas along with their second residency about a year later.  I was fortunate to see the show where Duff returned to fill in for their current bassist.  I loved GNR back when their first albums came out.  It is hard to stomach the three guitarists that are now in the place of Slash and Gilby/Izzy.  I must say though, this was a pretty decent show.  Besides the Chinese Democracy songs that have taken a very long time to grow on me, this show has ALL the favorites (except for Yesterdays), although there are too many guitar solos and too many songs not sung by Axl.  The quality of the concert footage is excellent.  The sound on this DVD (for it being a concert) is very good.  You do not hear the audience except for the breaks between songs.  In fact, the sound sounds almost too perfect.  Axl's voice is obviously not what it used to be but the quality of the sound is really good. This show was definitely high budget and polished.",1404604800,4,1153,4.2146118721461185
6403405,5,B00K6D1HUI,"First let me get one thing out of the way. I'm 28 years old and was rocking a sippy cup when my dad was in his early 20s rocking out to Appetite for Destruction. When I was ten, my 2 brothers and my father would jam the '92 Tokyo, Japan ""Illusion"" tapes well into our Sunday mornings having faux concerts in our living rooms. When I turned 18 and joined the army it became a staple while I was on leave to show up with a 24 pack of beer and relive those movies on DVD. Guns N' Roses has been my favorite band since I was 2. I even got to see the band live in 2011 front row in Dallas. With that said you understand I am well aware of everything the old members brought to the band and everything the new incarnation does as well. This concert is so much more than just that. It is a musical spectacle featuring some of the most talented musicians to ever occupy a stage. And I haven't even spoken a word of Axl Rose. There is a very good reason he is still relevant nearly 30 years after his first recorded effort made it's way onto radio platforms all over the world and shockingly, even at 50 years of age, it's never been more evident. Yes his voice shows age in spots, but he still mesmerizes and captivates. He still puts on the kind if performance that up and coming stars as well as well established acts wish they could achieve. The surrounding musicians ( guitarists DJ Ashba, Ron Bumblefoot Thal, Richard Fortus, Dizzy Reed, Chris Pittman, Tommy Stinson and Frank Ferrer) deliver a barrage of sound that delivers your old favorites with unbridled greatness as well as the new music with skill and technicality that only consumate professionals could. No it's not old Guns, but damn is it good. If you like so much as two songs from Gun N' Roses you owe it to yourself to pop this album in and rock your socks off.",1404604800,4,1823,4.256484149855908
6403406,4,B00K6D1HUI,"This has leapfrogged the 1992 Use Your Illusion concert release from Tokyo in terms of GN'R concert releases, in my opinion, for several reasons.  First off, the set spans every original album from Appetite for Destruction to Chinese Democracy, and every album has multiple songs in the set to represent it.  The performances are very good, if flawed and imperfect.  Bumblefoot only cements my view of him being an outstanding lead guitar player here with his stellar playing.  Axl's voice is good to great for the vast majority of the show here.  While he does have some moments that could've been better, and likely have been better during those songs (e.g. ""Sweet Child O' Mine"") at other shows, he sounds very good overall, even with a cleaner, less abrasive vocal tone during such songs as ""Rocket Queen"".  The highlights of this show for me include ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""This I Love"", ""Street of Dreams"", ""Catcher In The Rye"", ""Civil War"", ""Nightrain"", ""Patience"" and ""Paradise City"".

The audio and video quality are absolutely stellar and better than anything I have ever heard or seen in a concert release.  RockFuel did an outstanding job in that regard.  I am still blown away by how seamlessly the audio was mixed when listening to the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 of the Blu-ray.  The picture quality is crystal clear as well.  Another thing I noticed that I think RockFuel did an outstanding job on is the editing of the video.  I have seen some GN'R concert videos where the editing seemed completely random and senseless as was ultimately jarring. I think RockFuel did a great job in this regard.

I recommend this to any fan of the current incarnation of Guns N' Roses.  Having seen this Blu-ray performance, as well as performances on 11/23/12, 11/24/12, 06/04/14, 06/06/14 and 06/07/14 during the two Las Vegas residencies, they are an outstanding live band that put on a tremendous show.

6403408,4,B00K6D1HUI,"Really surprised to be honest.  I bought this wanting to see what I missed (after the concert in my area was cancelled in 2011).  Having heard Axl on Youtube in the past few years, I was a bit concerned.
I forgot all about that.  This is an awesome Bluray.  There are some issue here and there, but that makes it live.

Yes, Axl's voice is different.  The more I think about it, it's almost like he's decided to become a singer, and not a ******'d off guy with a band.  He doesn't have the angry voice he once had, probably somewhat to do with age and what he's done to his vocal cords over the years.  What he does have is a somewhat consistent range now, but on occasion goes back to the passionate scream and rasp he's known for.  Yes, it does sound like Mickey Mouse at times, but is that his actual 'singing' voice when hitting that note?  Maybe, maybe not.

The video is great, Rock Fuel did an outstanding job here.  I wish it was clearer in some areas, and if I had one complaint, it would be the 'dramatic' effects.  I would have rather had a clean video, but I don't hate.  It does prevent a perfect 5 star however.

The original lineup may or may not ever happen, but here's what you get.  I've been a GnR fan since I first heard AFD in highschool.  I'm happy to add this to my collection next to the 2 UYI DVDs.

Thanks Rock Fuel!  Great job.  The video and audio are outstanding.  Just wish I had a 3d TV.  :)",1404518400,25,1422,4.131868131868132

6403410,3,B00K6D1HUI,When I purchased this dvd I wasn't expecting the exact same sound as with the orig members.  And I was even ready for Axl to sound worse than past yrs because that generally happens with most vocalists with his style.  However what I wasn't expecting was the amount of impromptu jams leading up to some of the songs.  It became somewhat predictable and ruined what was mostly nice performances.  Considering there are not many gnr live dvds this is worth a watch.,1404518400,3,463,4.609756097560975

If you're a human being, or hell, if you're a living organism in our universe, this is a must have item. Guns' is the greatest band anyways, but Guns' in Vegas is something completely it's own. After you witness the contents of this disc, you will be planning a trip to Vegas next time Guns comes to town.

As for this concert itself...it's captured wonderfully in all it's 3D glory. The 2d version is great, but I highly recommend picking up a 3DTV if you haven't already done so. Most 3d live action films are shot in 2d, then converted after the fact. And while those films can look great in 3d, they are nothing compared to something shot with actual 3d cameras. And there are plenty of them, capturing every angle of the almost 3 hour show. (Very few artists play for three hours. Most play their contracted 90 minutes to the second then bail. Axl n' the crew keep on keepin' on and bust out hit after hit. Axl sounds fantastic, and the band are impeccable as always.

If I were forced to choose something to nitpick about, it'd be that I'm bummed the ""in between song banter"" has been cut. Axl is pretty chatty onstage.

It's unfortunate I even have to bring this up, but there's still people out there who immediately dismiss Guns today. To those who won't even give them a chance because it's not the ""same lineup"" or some other tired BS excuse, it's your loss. If you could open your eyes and ears and see and hear what's in front of you, instead of concentrating on what's not in front of you, you'd probably enjoy the hell outta yourself. We won't miss you.

All in all, go get this. Now.",1404432000,7,1735,4.280487804878049
6403413,2,B00K6D1HUI,"Sorry to point this out, but this video is not worth buying unless it goes on a lightning deal for 1.99 or less.  Is it because I am one of your New GnR haters who long for Slash to be back?  No.  In fact, one of the best musicians in hard rock (Ron ""Bumblefoot"" Thal) is one of the ONLY reasons you should watch this concert footage.

The real issues are these:

1) Watching this is like watching a poorly dubbed Chinese Kung Fu movie from the 80's.  Axle's mouth and the guys' guitar moves often don't match up with what is playing.  So this is really just a poorly done MTV video--for all of you who remember what an MTV video was.  We are hearing a song, but not experiencing it live.  The video is cobbled together.

2) Axle Rose--one of the most unique vocalists of the 80's--sounds terrible.  To understand how much this hurts, imagine if Slash could no longer play chords without bending them out of tune.  What a shame.  He garbles phrases, croaks, and catches his breath like Eric Cartman on a treadmill.

3) The musicians are phoning it in.  The band is so large, including some real obsolete players, that only TWO musicians do any work worth appreciating: Drummer Frank Ferrer and Guitar God Ron ""Bumblefoot"" Thal.  Only these TWO guys play their hearts out.  Frankly, I wish they would leave the new Guns and start a new band with somebody like Sebastian Bach or John Corrabi--musicians who give a damn and rock the hell out of their songs.

4) The ""new"" songs are mostly dull, boring, and forgettable.  Only ""Better"" as a whole, and some of Bumblefoot's solos are worth listening to.  I don't know how Ferrer keeps a strong beat to these awful songs without becoming an alcoholic.  Just terrible.

So, this is pretty much the spectacle of a dying Guns n Roses.  For example, while Thal and Ferrer play, Ashba gives the middle finger and makes silly hand gestures.  The other guys sometimes stare off into space while, again, Ferrer and Thal play music well.  Only Axle gives us a lot of energy, but quickly poops out.  Which is fine, because his singing has already pooped out.

Instead of wasting your money on this, I recommend you check out Sebastian Bach's new album, Red Dragon Cartel, In This Moment, some of Otep's songs, and everything The Pretty Reckless produce.  Or simply listen to Appetite for Destruction over and over again.",1404432000,11,2354,4.5669856459330145

Much as people don't like change, it happens. It's sad to say that what is dragging this band down (IMHO) is the only original band member left.

I saw this was gonna be on Sunday nite on AXS TV, and thought I'd watch it, there was nothing else on, I was stuck at home, and I was bored outta my mind. Then THIS came on, and I was just, amazed. Found out it was being released on dvd in 2 days, and ordered it immediately. The husband came home from work, and stayed up past his bedtime watching it, when he didn't want to, but once he started, he couldn't stop watching it. F everyone who says Axl isn't great. A few shaky moments, at the beginning of songs, but he has such a huge range, it takes a minute to get there, but it's never BAD, and the 2nd half, he's awesome. A favorite is ""The Seeker"", a Who cover, they do it better than the Who (like the Foo Fighters did ""Bargain"" better @ the vh1 Who Rock Honors)....his band is UNBELIEVABLY great. My dvd came today, I've watched it twice.

No words. Not what I was expecting, in all the GREAT ways. My 21 year old son only wanted to see this concert on his 21st birthday, but couldn't get to Vegas.

Do we really need three guitarists and two keyboardists? And why does that guy have to wear the hat? Are the band members obligated to cop the look of a fired member? Anyway. I saw them in concert twice. Great shows. I think back in 2006.

This is awful, however. The band is alright. How can they not? They were assembled to replicate a sound. But the problem is that Axl can't really hire a new lead singer. The vocal sound problems begin in the aptly titled,""It's So Easy."" There is no easy way to say it, but its time to fire the singer, get a new one. I am sorry.

6403424,4,B00K6D1HUI,"In the tradition of Guns N' Roses, it has been twenty-two years since the last home video release of a concert (the Use Your Illusion set in 1992). Needless to say, quite a few things have changed in the land of Guns N' Roses since then. The ultimate question being, of course: is it worth the wait. I can definitely say it is. Being able to see a professionally recorded show with the new lineup is quite a thrill. It gives a new perspective to the Guns N' Roses songs I have known for years, and it was quite exciting to see songs from Chinese Democracy in an official live release.

As for the band itself...it's mammoth, and tight. In addition to three guitarists, there are two synthesizer/keyboard players, bass, drums, and of course the great Axl Rose. Although looking a little worse for the wear, there is absolutely no denying Rose still sings the hell out of the songs. Occasionally, the effect of age on his voice is inescapable, but considering Rose can still sing these songs at the age of 52 while giving his all physically is nothing short of spectacular.

The DVD itself is fantastic. The picture was absolutely immaculate, and the sound mix was perfect. I have seen this band live twice, and listening to the DVD I was able to pick up intricacies in the sound (particularly the guitars) that I'd never heard before. The extra interviews (with keyboardist Dizzy Reed, bassist Tommy Stinson, Guitarist Ron ""Bumblefoot"" Thal, and guitarist DJ Ashba) are all very entertaining and go a long way towards showing this is a real band and not just Axl's yes men.

This is definitely worth a purchase, and I know I will be watching this over and over and giving my old Use Your Illusion VHS tapes a much needed break.",1404259200,7,1726,4.5792880258899675

6403428,1,B00K6D1HUI,"They're definitely something else. Call it a cover band, a shadow of what Guns N' Roses were, whatever, but one thing is certain, this is not the band we all used to love back in the late 80s - early 90s. The current line-up has eight members, unknown musicians playing other people's material for money. Axl Rose, the sole original member of the band, lost his voice - completely. He sounds nothing like he did before and yes, this is considering that he has aged considerably, like everyone else. His voice is absolutely shot, terrible sound. Just listen to You Could Be Mine or Better, then go and find performances from prior years of said songs. 100% different.

The blu-ray itself presents a nice video and audio quality, the unknown guys playing other people's material for money do the songs justice bar DJ Ashba who is a terrible guitar player, a very random amateur guitarist from YouTube would do 1000 times better than him and let's be honest, Slash's solos aren't that complicated. There's a guy called Chris Pitman or whatever, never heard of him before until the purchase of the blu-ray. I would like to know, why is he in the band? He's completely useless.

My respect to both guitarist Bumblefoot and Richard Fortus, these guys know what they're doing. It's just sad that they're playing other people's material for money. They should definitely release a record together, if they haven't already. Bumblefoot - although a silly stage name - does justice to both Slash and Buckethead's guitar parts. His guitar tone is absolutely atrocious but one can deal with it. Slash's Estranged solos are one of my favorites and I truly liked Bumblefoot's rendition. Why is Richard Fortus mostly a rhythm guitarist? He should take all the Ashba's leads, for Christ's sake. Ashba is a complete joke and in this particular show, he's behavior is unbearable.

Dizzy Reed, why are you - after all these years - still Axl Rose's lapdog? He has no dignity whatsoever. Frank Ferrer, he's decent although he's gotta be the worst drummer Guns N' Roses ever had. My favorite is Josh Freese and Brain Mantia, followed by Steven Adler and Matt Sorum. I think that's it.

For those who don't know if this is worth $17, I can tell you, it isn't. I mean, the band sounds good but Axl Rose is definitely the one who made this release a very bad one. His voice is terribly shot, completely dreadful. I'm returning this blu-ray ASAP since I don't want to have it in my collection. There's no reason for me to put this along my Gn'R CDs and my Tokyo DVDs. Not only is not Guns N' Roses, but it's just a fat, out-of-breath Axl Rose trying to convince me that he's still got it. A complete joke.

6403429,3,B00K6D1HUI,"Really wanted to like this more...When you compare the production of the Use Your Illusion dvds  filmed in Tokyo in 1992 to the production of this set from 2012, it just doesn't stand up.

I couldn't tell if I was watching a dubbed over music video or a concert.  Youtube clips made of the Vegas shows highlight the spirit of the live performance, and I think showcase a more realistic viewing of Axl's current range than this video.  The editing moves away from his face moreso when certain notes are sung, and was especially noticeable in November Rain.  Ditto on the guitars, in some instances more noticeable than others.

Anyone who says this wasn't edited out the ying yang is fooling themselves.  In an age of digital trickery across the board, is it that unusual?  No, probably not for the standards of ""concert"" videos today.  Is it disappointing compared to analog videos of the same performer 20 years ago? Yes.  I played the hell out of a VHS of the old GnR when they aired a special on MTV with Aerosmith from Paris when I was a kid, you could tell there was genuine singing and playing live on those shows--it's so hard to tell what's an overdub or digital enhancement and what's real from that performance on the DVD, and that's the most disappointing thing.  We KNOW all these performers are top performers, why couldn't we get a concert that didn't look like a glossy commercialized video, and showed the gritty nature of true performance instead of sounding like they went and recorded most of it again to play over the footage?

Probably the closest to an accurate performance was when they played the newer stuff, which if you think about it makes sense, as it showcases the new band and Axl's current vocal state and it's their group baby.  Still too much tinkering in the editing process for my taste.  It's okay, but could've been leagues better, and should've been.

And don't forget to check out those liner notes on the inside of the booklet for what *may* be a dig at an old bandmate...",1404259200,6,2013,4.599439775910364
6403430,3,B00K6D1HUI,"I'll start by saying the music sounds amazing. I know a lot of people like to bash this line up, but they can play! Bumblefoot shreds and Frank Ferrer is the best drummer GnR has ever had. The band plays really tight.

Having said that, it is really hard to listen to Axl's aging voice. He no longer has the pipes that he once did. It is really evident when trying to sing at the edges (really low or really high). On his lower register with songs such as ""It's So Easy"" he sounds like a bullfrog croaking through the song. ""Estranged"" was also very difficult for him and even harder on the listener. On the higher pitched songs such as ""Welcome to the Jungle"", his highs fall flat and he just doesn't have the same power behind it.

He does pull it together for some songs, like ""Live and Let Die"" and the opener ""Chinese Democracy"",  Axl actually sounds pretty good on those. Axl really needs to cater the setlist to his current range or do what some of the other aging bands do, and change the song arrangements to a key that better suits the signer's  vocal range.

The production on this disc is really good. The 3D looks amazing and has a lot of depth. It's one of the better looking 3D discs I have in my collection (using a Panasonic 3D TV w/ active glasses).",1404259200,33,1267,4.2845188284518825
6403431,5,B00K6D1HUI,What an amazing show! The band was on fire that night and the production and 3D depth is out of this world. This is a must buy for hard core fans and casual fans alike.,1404259200,6,168,3.8285714285714287
6403432,5,B00K6D1HUI,"An outstanding product that is highly recommended to anyone who was ever even been a casual fan of this legendary act. It is no secret that there have been significant personnel changes through the years- but it is quite evident on this release that Axl's odyssey has brought him full-circle back to an entity that is every bit ""Guns N' Roses"" in spirit and attitude. More excitingly- this is NO nostalgia effort- but rather an explosive 8 piece assault with a level of virtuosity and execution that both gives the classics incredible new life while simultaneously presenting many of the best cuts off 2008's Chinese Democracy with great flair and grandeur. I am sure many on the fence have undoubtedly heard rumors about the current line-up of Guns N' Roses being a ""great live act"". Perhaps some took note of the fact that the band brought home back-to-back Ultimate Classic Rock Magazine Tour of the Year Awards- or saw that Axl was recently presented with the Golden Gods Lifetime Achievement Award. Do yourself a favor- pick up this release- and confirm it for yourself. Treat yourself to the nearly 3 hours of raucous rock n' roll you know deep down you've been missing for years. You won't regret it...",1404172800,4,1209,4.7894736842105265
6403433,3,B00K6D1HUI,"As a big fan of g'n'r I went ahead and bought this today with an open mind hoping it would be changed from how I feel about guns and roses being split apart and unable to come back together, even for their rock and roll hall of fame induction. The set list and production of this DVD is very good, and the musicians play their parts well, but I can't help but feel a little sad and disappointed after watching it. Everyone does their best in this performance, but it just feels like a forced rehash of old glories. Unlike the last two slash albums, and hopefully the next, this just doesn't seem to be adding anything to the legacy of the unfortunately splintered former original g'n'r members.",1404172800,,694,4.4296875

The whole band is on fire, Axl sounds good and is full of energy. I recommend this to all rock fans, and to all GN'R fans old and new. Yes, there's lots of talks n' comparisons of the band line ups. Before anyone even starts to compare based on youtube videos or internet reviews, do yourself a favor and buy this, crank up the sound and enjoy! Old was good, new is good, this music rocks! And the presentation is the best you can get with today's technology.",1404172800,5,661,4.246031746031746

6403436,5,B00K6D1HUI,"Listen, I know its not the original band, but why should Axl not play these songs. They deserve to be heard with hid voice. I support what Slash does with Myles Kennedy and when they play the old stuff. Axl and Duff have seemed to patch things up. Listen these songs are so classic I'll take them anyway I can get them. All the haters should just enjoy the music because at the end of the day its about classic songs.",1404172800,6,417,4.160493827160494
6403437,4,B00K6D1HUI,"I got the blu ray in the mail today and I think the audio mixing and video editing are fantastic. I can actually hear what the band is supposed to sound like in concert. Great job, Rockfuel!! Now for my critique of the show itself: the band is great for most of it. Richard, Tommy, Ron, Dizzy, and Frank (for 80% of it) do a great job. Axl is hit and miss. He is strong in the beginning but there are some songs he is just awful on (Estranged and You Could Be Mine come to mind). DJs bends are very hard to listen to at times, he hits quite a few bad notes, and his camera mugging and ""audience look at me"" nonsense just....annoys me. Lastly, Frank. Jeez, a random drummer who has never played ""Don't Cry"" before could play it better than that. He's not playing the same groove as the rest of the musicians and during the solo everyone is on full distortion and he's hitting rim shots instead of snare. Just play the song. It's like his refusal or inability to play the correct rhythm to ""Mr. Brownstone"" - anybody can tap it on their steering wheel driving home why can't a pro drummer play it on a drum set? I don't mind changing fills and switching things up here and there but if the rest of the band is playing it the OTHER way - then do it that way. If it were up to me I would have cut out the band member solos because Around ""Knockin'' I was ready for it to be over with. Ranting aside, I like my blu ray. I'm glad to have something new to add to my GNR collection after only a 6 year wait. This should buy them the rest of the decade anyway.",1404172800,2,1551,4.055374592833876

6403439,4,B00K6D1HUI,Yeah yeah no izzy duff or slash but it still rocks!  I saw the new GNR in Houston a bit before this recording .  While it's not the old band it was an awesome gig.  I still love the rest of the old band but they all moved on and made great solo music.  go dig that too!,1404172800,3,269,3.586206896551724
6403440,1,B00K6D1HUI,"Yea. As much as I love Guns N"" Roses, I don't like this DVD...
The whole performance was almost like a strip club with women pole dancing. Also 96% of the time the audio was up and down. I don't like they're new music either, but love their late 80s-early 90s. I want a refund!",1404172800,3,277,4.054545454545455

Over 3-hours of music, and never sounded better, and I've seen them a half dozen times in the 80's and 90's.  Even Izzy and Duff jammed with them a few times this past year.  ENJOY!",1404172800,9,318,4.508771929824562
6403442,5,B00K6D1HUI,"Highly recommend this to Guns N' Roses fans of any era. The picture quality is superb and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound made me feel like I was listening to the concert live in person. As an eight piece band, GNR really thrives in surround sound, giving all of the instruments room to breathe. Axl sounds great for most of the show as does the rest of the band. A few hiccups here and there, proving this is the real deal. A perfectly captured Guns N' Roses concert. Not a polished studio release masquerading as a ""live"" recording. The setlist runs the gamut and has something for everybody. Have not watched the Blu-ray in 3D yet, so can't comment on that aspect, but the picture and sound get 10 out of 10.",1404172800,23,722,4.395522388059701

6403444,5,B00K6D1HUI,"I'm watching the new Guns N' Roses Appetite For Democracy DVD now and it's just really great. Yes, Slash, Duff and Izzy are gone, but Axl's got himself a great band: Ron Thal-lead guitar, DJ Ashba- lead guitar, Richard Fortus- rhythm guitar, Tommy Stinson- bass guitar, Frank Ferrer- drums, Dizzy Reed- keyboards, Chris Pitman- keyboards. This is no nostalgia act, the old songs sound fresh and revitalized and the band really is tight and has a great chemistry--it's not like watching Axl and a bunch of hired hands, the way some people characterize the later-day lineups. The new songs like ""This I Love"" and ""Catcher in the Rye"" sound great and more organic live and blend in nicely with the classics. The visuals are quite cool and not overdone and the whole concert has a good flow. Some other highlights include great solos by DJ Ashba and Ron Thal, an instrumental version of Led Zeppelin's ""No Quarter"" from Dizzy Reed, and Tommy's awesome, punkish ""Motivation"" from his 2004 album ""Village Gorilla Head."" I'm not saying that the current lineup is better than the old Guns N' Roses, but this performance is a lot better than the bloated one from the 1992 live in Japan DVDs. Hoping to hear the follow-up to Chinese soon.",1404172800,6,1228,4.769953051643192
6403445,5,B00K6D1HUI,"I've used to be like everybody here posting 1 star reviews. I though Guns N Roses ended when Slash left and without Slash, there is no Guns N Roses. All I saw was a fat Axl who couldn't sing playing with a bunch of unknown musicians who suck. I did have the opportunity to see them in there latest ""No Trickery"" residency at the joint, on June 4th. I went in kind of skeptical, but I came out loving the new band. They are great musicians with great musicianship and I loved it. Axl sounded amazing and I felt like I needed to have this. Some things I've realized in Slash was hardly GnR at all, yeah he wrote some s***, and yeah he had a style and groove no one could imitate, but Axl and Izzy are the ones who busted their ass writing music for the band, and they wrote all the songs that got them famous. You guys need to stop living in the past and realize that it's been 21 years since we last saw the band we loved. Time moves on, things changed, Guns N' Roses changed. Just because your precious guitar player you worship decided to move, doesn't mean Axl can't move on too. We all loved the original lineup, but face it, it's never happening again. These guys are very good and work very good together, give it a chance!",1404086400,4,1228,4.185654008438819
6403446,1,B00K6D1HUI,"How can anyone waste their money on this? I love how they positioned this run of shows as mostly stuff from ""Appetite"" and ""Chinese Democracy."" All they did was repackage the same set they've been playing for more than a decade. No difference. I mean, what else are they gonna play. This is a ""band"" -- really just Axl and other guys -- that's been around for 27 YEARS and has FOUR full-length studio albums to its credit. FOUR.

The two guitarists - Bumblefoot & Rich Forteous - are shredders and are the only guitarists needed. D.J. Ashba is a mini-Axl and a waste of space and money.

The show itself was pretty much pedestrian when it comes to the entire history of Guns & Roses - post Slash, so as far as that goes, there is no new ground being broken here.

Thanks, but I'll pass...",1404086400,10,455,4.267441860465116

Best pro shot GNR show ever - kudos to rockfuel and all involved. Going to be watching this for many years to come. Thank you Axl, Rockfuel and GNR.",1404086400,6,334,3.8550724637681157

I watched this show at the movies AND already watched the DVD. The sound is amazing, the band is on fire and Axl... well.. Axl is the greatest frontman of the history. His moves and his voice, his passion and energy up on the stage is hypnotizing. This show is a MUST-HAVE for any big GNR fan! The camera work is great and explores every single inch of the great stage at the Joint. This is rock n roll at its finest, go ahead and buy this show!",1403913600,10,610,4.049586776859504
6403450,3,B00K6D1HUI,"I have always been a huge fan of old and new GnR. This Movie was a little disappointing. Axl's voice had treatments on it during the whole show. They have become a cover band for GnR of old. All three guitar players are incredible, but they spent most of the show covering Slash or doing long feature spots. There is way to much ""fill"" in the show. There is way to little new material. I expected more than a good cover band with a slash clone and, an Izzy clone. The whole band are world class players but............",1403827200,5,518,4.295918367346939
6403451,1,B00K6D1HUI,"I feel bad, but there's just no appetite for this Axl Rose solo concert at all. To start, the name is ridiculous-- democracy? what is he talking about and how do you have an appetite for democracy? The name of the band is a whole other story-- this is not GNR the same way that Mick Jagger isn't The Rolling Stones without The Rolling Stones, or (in a better example) how Queensryche isn't Geoff Tate by himself (he recently lost the court battle for the name to the three original members). Apparently Buckethead has been replaced by Bumblefoot, but Bubblearms is waiting in the wings to take over. It's just no fun watching a bunch of strangers play the old songs-- really no different than watching a cover band, although I had more fun watching the GNR cover band Appetite for Destruction. The show itself is hyper-vain and glam. Axl looks like a clownish cowboy with all his silly costumes. His voice does sound good on many of the songs, but I wonder if the vocals were dubbed for this the way much of his other live stuff has been in the past (Live Era and Live like a Suicide). I can't say because I wasn't at the show, but even someone there might not know. The front cover is a recycled rip off of the first appetite cover. Overall, it's a cheap gimmick to sell his new band for hire. No other band member from any band has gotten away with such a rip off of a band's name and image in the history of rock music. It's so sad that this video is even for sale. If you're new to this music, go back and find the old live bootleg shows-- that was the real thing.",1403654400,18,1568,4.26510067114094

This lineup plays the songs as good as they have ever been played. If you are one of the people who won't even give this version of Guns N' Roses a chance because it's not the original lineup, you are missing out. They put on a great live show. They play the songs as good or better than ever. Very high energy. Almost like there is 6 Axl's on the stage. Axl may be older now but he is still the greatest hard rock front man of all time. A living legend. I got to meet Axl the night this concert was filmed and he was really nice and friendly to me. Really down to earth and let me get photo with him and signed autographs. It was a night I will never forget! I am a lifelong Guns N' Roses fan. I have went and seen every lineup there has been. It really seams like this lineup has become a well oiled machine. They have got a really good groove going. They need to get in the studio and get creative. I also met Bumblefoot, really nice guy.",1403568000,8,1083,3.9724770642201834
6403453,5,B00K6D1HUI,"[Updated my review since I received the BD from Amazon - my review was previously for the full HD 1080p digital stream]

07.06.2014 edit: some people talk about out of sync (OOS) issues during the second half of the show... It just seems like these people are waiting for anything to take cheap shots at the band or anything they produce (or is produced by other people for the band). This concert is not out of sync.

This is a really good Guns N' Roses show, filmed towards the end of their 2012 residency (Axl's voice was pretty strong after a few shows). This release is way better than the Live at London O2 2012 which aired on Japanese TV last year (even though we don't have Izzy Stradlin here). Audio mix is by all means far superior and editing is a lot more enjoyable and fitting a live concert (a lot less crowd shots and no models dancing before the front rows). It's really nice to have a new pro-shot by Guns N' Roses, and especially the very first live release from the new line-up!

About the show itself and the atmosphere, I think we could do without the dancers (I know we're in Vegas but anyway), but setlist is top quality, with all the classics, some good covers, also some Illusions songs (Estranged, Civil War, Don't Cry...) and several songs from the last album Chinese Democracy.

For those who like the technical aspect of things, the video quality and bitrate are excellent (variable bitrate between 12 and 20 mbps), and the sound quality is a lot better than the digital stream. It's loud and very well balanced, and definitely one of the best sounding concert BD/ DVD out there. As for the audio track, you have two DTS choices : DTS 2.0, with a nice mix and good bitrate (1.5mbps), and DTS 5.1 (1.5mbps as well), which sounds excellent. Every GN'R fan needs to buy this new release, you won't be disappointed! Rock Fuel has done a very good job on producing this, I'd like to thank them and give them our congrats, as well as the band for a good concert!",1403481600,14,1985,4.445054945054945
