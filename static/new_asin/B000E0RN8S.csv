2477253,5,B000E0RN8S,"Exactly what I was expecting. The first movie is better than the sequel, but I already knew that and having both keeps the continuity of the narrative in tact & the price made the choice easy. I have the book that the films are taken from & found the movies to be better than the book. This in itself is a rarity.",1520380800,2,313,4.064516129032258

2477284,4,B000E0RN8S,It is great to have both films on one disc.  Quite convenient.  As a musician there are moments in both films that hit home.  The first group I jammed with had a lead man who was remarkably similar to the Eddie character.  So I really like both films.  I would have given this DVD 5 stars if it weren't for a technical deficiency:  there are no closed captions or subtitles available on either side.  In today's market that is just not acceptable.,1507507200,,447,4.378048780487805

2477290,5,B000E0RN8S,"John Cafferty & Michael Par ARE Eddie Wilson! I saw the first one on a plane when it was new. There were distractions on the plane, but I enjoyed the movie. There really needed to be a part two, then there was, and now I have them both. It's two singularly great stories entwined.

I've always loved Eddie and the Cruisers!  I remember watching it when I was younger, and it was one of my all time favorites!! I do like the second one because they follow the story line so well. Although I wish they could've incorporated more of the original characters they did do A few flashbacks.  Also with the second movie it's more of a real time, so you get to know the Eddie character a lot more.  That was the only complaint I ever had about the first movie. It was a huge flashback movie seen through one of the characters memories, so you really don't get to know Eddie on any kind of level. It's all mainly surface with his character which is a shame because I believe it could've been a blockbuster movie had they shot the movie through Eddies eyes and in real time!! I also believe they waited to long for the follow up movie. I am still very happy that I purchased this DVD because having the 2 movies on one disc makes it very convenient.  If anyone has any questions about either of these movies please feel free to ask me!",1471910400,2,1059,4.306532663316583

2477732,5,B000E0RN8S,"Eddie and the Cruisers

News person Maggie Foley (Ellen Barkin) suspects that a singer Eddie Wilson (Michael Par) after being missing for 19 years. In her search for Eddie she interviews the other members of his band. Each member in turn visualizes what it was like when Eddie was alive. We go along for the ride in a series of flashbacks.

Not part of the original music but fun to hear again is ""Runaway"" by Del Shannon.

The story is fun to watch as it unfolds. It will only work for you if you like the particular music as that is just as much a character of the movie as the people.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!

I am going to assume that you watched the first movie ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" (1983).  However the sequel movie stands on its own.

Being a sequel this is not as simple as just a new movie.  People will come to it for different reasons.  Some like the music of Beaver Brown.  Some like the actors.  Whatever your reason you will not be disappointed.

In the early 60s Eddie Wilson (Michael Par) had one the most popular bands.  At the height of his dream of making perfect music Eddie Wilson's car is found in the river; however his body was never found.

Flash-forward 20 years. The record company promotes the thought that Eddie might still be alive and plays a lot of his old recordings.  This in a new girlfriend encourages him to try one more time at perfecting his music.  We go long to follow his trials and tribulations.  Will he succeed?  Watch this movie and find out.",1390608000,,1586,4.620071684587813

2477764,3,B000E0RN8S,"Don't let the title of my review fool you; I love both movies like crazy, and I'm glad the second got any DVD release at all in the USA.

That said, the execution of this set is really very poor, especially for 2008 home video standards. First, the films aren't even on separate discs, just a DVD-18 ""flipper"" that's very easily damaged. These types of discs were abandoned for that very reason, and I'm glad most studios eventually quit using them.

The picture and sound are very good on both films, light-years ahead of the old VHS releases, but there's zero extras of any kind. That's right, you heard me...ZERO. The menus are incredibly basic, and the least they could've done is some kind of retrospective, or maybe even a profile on the novel's author P.F. Kluge. Sadly, this set has nothin', which is real shame.

This year is the 30th anniversary of the first film, but sadly, no other releases have come forward. I'm hoping that someday soon, whoever owns the rights to these masterpieces finally gives something back to the fans who made them so popular to begin with (both movies died quickly at cinemas, only to rise again on cable).

So, this set gets three stars out of five. If you're a fan of the films, this is the best there is for now...but both stories deserve a lot better treatment.",1382054400,,1305,4.564102564102564

However, it is close-captioned in English.  for those newbies who do not know the difference (i was one not long ago), subtitles display thru your high-quality HDMI cable connection.  close-captions do not.  you can only get close-captions by using the lower-quality 3-cable audio-visual (RCA plug) connections (red, white, yellow).  the second movie - E&C Eddie Lives - IS subtitled in English,French, Spanish.  The quality of the movies is OK, not spectacular, but perfectly watchable and enjoyable.  it just appears they have not been remastered.  pretty much like watching a movie recorded in non-HD mode played back thru an ordinary DVD player.  but overall i'm very happy with the purchase and would make it again, knowing what i have related above.  for less than $10 and no other cheap way to get the movies, you definitely get your money's worth.

In the second movie I thought that Eddie was a bit of an egomaniac and a pushy jerk. I was a musician for about twenty years...that's a lot of rockin' and rollin', and I would never have put up with the BS that he put the band through.
Other than that, I did really enjoy both movies.

2477796,5,B000E0RN8S,"Michael Pare has the Eddie Wilson part, right-on, acted superbly!

If anything was amiss with this set of flicks, it was the script writing not being quite believable in several places, during both flicks.

In the first part, ""Eddie & The Cruisers;"" I think it a bit of a stretch that Eddie, as close as he and his girl, Joanne Carlino were, that: on the gig at ""the Word-man's"" Alma Mater college, at Homecoming: we see Joanne and the Word-man,(actor Tom Berenger's character), hugging and kissing, with real emotion and passion for each other, all in direct line-of-sight, a hundred feet or so, from the porch where Eddie and the rest of the band sat or stood watching? Then, when Joanne wants to go back, instead of walking around the fire and appearing from another direction, they walk straight from where they kissed each other, over to the porch where the rest of the band was? This, both knowing how jealous, possessive and quick tempered, Eddie was?

But then, later-on in this same movie, we hear the all important lines that: Joanne Carlino was never really Eddies first love; Eddie's music was his only true love!

What was Joanne Carlino's lines supposed to be all-about, at the very end of the first flick, when she gets the phone call signals, only Eddie used to call her with and thinks its Eddie coming back from the dead, or what? I'm still not quite sure what the writers meant to portray at this ending section of this first movie. The script plot and lines here, were really thin. The actress portraying Joanne, acted the part as well as could be expected and manages to keep this weak plot section, believable. It only lasts a minute or so, total, and still shows how Eddies vanishing off-the-face of the earth, 18 years before, has truly affected those of his closest friends, the Cruisers band members he left behind, so very deeply, in so many ways.

Now, in the second flick, ""Eddie Lives!"" here we see Eddie Wilson, near the flicks start, going to a Eddie Wilson look-alike contest in NYC, and his only disguise is a mustache? No one there recognized the real Eddie Wilson in the audience? This, at a crowded & televised Eddie Wilson Look-alike contest??? However, this writing snafu, was not Micheal Pares' fault! Michael Pare became Eddie Wilson, made Eddie live larger-than-life, in these two flicks!

I had problems in ""Eddie Lives"" Part 2, with the screen play writing again, when 20 years later, Eddie reveals to his new love, at her loft apartment, that he is really Eddie Wilson. The lines were just too contrived, building-up to Eddie giving his girl friend that info and why. Also hard to believe, was her lame reaction and response: she bumbles around stammering like a dummy, instead of total dumb-founded shock that she had just crawled out of bed, after sleeping with the great rock n roll star legend, Eddie Wilson!

However, to its credit: both movies, parts 1 and 2, I thought were pretty well written over-all.

We get to see how Eddie shaped the sound and made simple poems the Word-man wrote, set to simple music lead lines and chord structures; be turned into monster smash rock n roll hit songs, through Eddies ear and great rock music savvy! We get to go into the major label recording studios of that early day and time, in rock n rolls infancy and we get to watch, listen and learn...how the original rock music pioneer stars recorded, back then!

Each time I watch these two movies, back-to-back once again,(which is 3-4 times every year), I learn something new, from Eddies love for music and what is truly important as a musician in the music business, and what is not. Eddie lived for the best music, he could possibly make/play. He was truly a peak performer! Anytime he was on stage fronting his band, he gave his music, his all, everything he had and was! We get to watch his music evolve with the years, watch Eddie grow, with his music!

What I love about these two flicks, is the whole story line, the great late 50's, early 60's classic Rock Music the way it really sounded, the raw energy it exuded live, back then, and the fact that, by the end of the second flick, we finally get to watch our dreams come true!

Those of us who were alive and heard the radio announcement, remember the loss we all felt, all too vividly, on Feb. 3, 1959, (the Day The Music Died). That was the day Buddy Holly, J.P. Richardson-""the Big Bopper"", and Ritchie Valens' plane wreckage and their bodies were found, in that Iowa field.

Then, just 18 years and a few months later, all of us once again, were stopped still in our tracks, not able to quite comprehend that newscast, having to turn it up and listen one more time. We were stunned speechless, the second we truly ""understood"" the TV news confirming that: Elvis ""the King of Rock N Roll,"" was dead. For those of us whom clearly remember those fateful newscasts when they happened; this set of movies, gives us all, the perfect ending of our dreams, ever since we lost those first original Rock N Roll Music pioneer legend artists, so suddenly, all those years ago!

Because, when Eddie Wilson, in Part 2, the last scene, on that Toronto Concert stage with his new band, introduces all the rest of his band mates, and then tells the world he is really Eddie Wilson; we get to see our fondest dreams fulfilled, when finally, once again, Eddie LIVES! And so, through Eddie being still alive and rocking the music once again, after having disappeared and considered dead the prior 20 years; do we get Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper and Elvis, back once again! It's kinda as if, through these two movies, we all get to see our fav original rock n roll music pioneers, live once again, through Eddie Wilson!

This is so very important to me, because...I know only too well...there is no other way, we'll ever get Buddy, Ritchie, Elvis, or the Big Bopper, back again...! This very fact, is what makes these two movies, so very powerful, to me!

So, let me watch two of my most fav music flicks one more time, while dreaming in my mind that: Eddie Wilson alive on that stage and rocking-out with his bands, is really Elvis, or Buddy, or Ritchie, or the Big Bopper, up there on that stage rocking-out again, still with us all! Just for the 3-4 hours it takes to watch both these movies again...it seems like, maybe...they never really left us...? Could it be?

The great original rock n roll on these CD's, is worth every cent you spend! The movies are really good, together, as well! There is NO WAY, you can waste a dime, buying this movie combo DVD set!

These two movies, are the stuff true music dreams and stardust, are surely made of! :)",1370476800,,6652,4.581160639192599

So when I noticed that I could get both I and II for a low price, I ordered it although I already had a copy of the first movie. I enjoyed watching Eddie and the Cruisers once again, enjoying the plot and music as much as the first time I watched it. I thought Eddie and the Cruisers II was a little slow, but when I began to enjoy it, the DVD froze. It would not play the movie past a certain point. I am not certain if it's the actual DVD itself that caused it, or if it's the DVD player. I have since watched other movies with no problem. So needless to say, I was disappointed that I did not get to watch all of Eddie and the Cruisers II. The other thing that disappointed me about the movie was that only one of the original Cruisers made a brief appearance, so the movie was not an actual ""Cruiser"" movie, but about Eddie's new band.",1349913600,,901,4.039106145251397

To me personally, these movies are awesome. The only criticism I can level is that the beginning of ""Eddie Lives"" seems to be weak, like a low budget outfit made the movie. Weak acting and directing. But the overall plot is sound, which saves the day.

Both movies are great. Arguably the first movie was produced better (they had a larger budget?).",1337472000,,519,4.7555555555555555

2477983,5,B000E0RN8S,"I fell in love with this movie back when I first saw it on HBO in the 80's.  As a prior reviewer noted, this movie's theatrical release was not met with great success.  I don't ever remember seeing it come to the theaters in my area.  I would have gone to see it because I like the kind of music that was featured in it.  It was an intriguing plot.  Who hasn't gotten fed up with their life at some point and wished they could just disappear seemingly without any consequences?  With the first film, you see a talented up and coming musician.  He is sensitive, brillant and typically moody full of all the angst that his character could possibly relay.  Michael Pare did an outstanding job of portraying the tourchered Eddie Wilson.  We watch him as he tries to grow intellectually but he's not really sure what he is trying to grasp onto.  We see him see something in the character of Frank.  The two of them met on an intellectual level that no other member of the group was able to with the possible exception of the character of Joann, Eddie's longtime girlfriend.  Some how, despite all the trials and tribulations, this band was beginning to be successful.  They had a sound that the public responded to.  There was something in the intensity of Eddie Wilson's words that appealed to them.  Not only did Eddie Wilson touch the characters in the movies with his intensity, he touched those of us that were watching his story unfold.  The whole cast was an excellent roster of actors.  Once I saw this movie, I knew I had to add it to my audio/visual library.  I taped the movie the next time it ran on HBO.  I played it so much because I loved the music that the sound and picture finally wore out.  By that time though, the movie had been released on VHS.  As soon as I heard it had been released, I bought it.  I forget where I bought movies in those days.  We didn't have Amazon back then that made it easy to pick whichever merchant we wanted for the best prices on a movie. As soon as the cassette was released of the soundtrack, I went to the nearest music store and bought that as well.  Imagine my disappointment when the CD was finally released of it and there were a few songs that were missing from that release.  It was back to the movie again to get my fix of the marvelous sounds of John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band.  Bruce Springsteen eat your heart out.  This band has you beat to shame.  That is not to say that Bruce isn't worthy of a listen he is.  I have quite a few of his albums.  There was something about this movie and this music that touched my soul.  Apparently it touched a lot of other peoples soul as well because a sequel was released.  By that time, these two movies had reached cult status and rightly so.  Do I recommend these two movies and the subsequent soundtracks?  You bet I do.  Be careful which release of the soundtrack that you get though, there are different versions.  Indeed EDDIE LIVES!",1288051200,6,2946,4.351102941176471

2477987,5,B000E0RN8S,"Eddie and the Cruisers, 1 & 2, the hardest thing to do is figure out which is #1. I liked the story behind #1 as a whole, but #2 has some great spots. In the second movie, these two spots alone would offset even the worst movie script (and this was not a bad script), let's just say worth the price of admission alone.

When Eddie and Sal meet up on the Jersey Shore, a classic and well done scene of two lost friends finally getting together to hash things out, even though Eddie was supposed to be dead.

The best scene in the movie, and one of the greatest musical scenes in recent cinematic history, has to be the ""Some like it hot"" scene. It is like watching a live video done very well by all the band, and of course Michale Pare. It is just an awesome song, very catchy and singable if you are so inclined.
The '50s style dancing of Marina Orsini is spectacular, and watching Michael Pare's reaction to it, all the while performing at a very high level, adds a third dimension to the scene. I watch this scene over and over again, it is a perfect scene. It has music, dance, and multiple emotion levels all happening at once. Yes, well worth the price of admission.",1280620800,3,1172,4.251121076233184

The ending of the original left the possibilty for a second part which was made some years later with almost an entirely new cast, very much like you would expect for a movie that is supposedly taking place 20 years later.  I loved Part 2!  I have watched both movies twice.  The music is great, and I can identify with the main character.  I just wish I could sing and play the guitar as well as his character does.  The real music was writen and performed by John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band.

2478013,5,B000E0RN8S,"These movies connect with me emotionally every time I watch them. The first movie has that grainy, edgy quality found in 70s movies. Movies shot on location always fare better with the ""feeling"" of place. To some people this movie's storyline may feel cliched but the acting emotes a certain quality that connects with your soul. The songs are very strong. I was a DJ in a bar when this movie was first out and ""On the Dark Side"" and ""Tender Years"" were always favorites. They also capture the vulnerability of youth that the movie is depicting. Besides the outstanding songs, the thing that makes this movie for me is how Michael Pare completely captures the heart & soul of the songs by John Cafferty while lip-syncing them. Incredible.

Eddie Lives! does a great job to once again show the drive of Eddie Wilson to make the band the best they can be. Michael Pare is outstanding in this movie. He really captures the essence of his character as being desperate, sad, and vulnerable all at the same time. Once the movie is over I really wished that Eddie Wilson was real. Once again the marriage of Michael Pare's acting and John Cafferty's songs is just great and is the heart of the movie.",1265068800,,1193,4.574766355140187
2478014,5,B000E0RN8S,"We loved the original when it first came out in the 80's. Tom Beringer, Ellen Barkin, Michael Pare and Joe Pantoliano are just a few of the still familiar faces from this little movie. It's campy, clean and John Cafferty wrote a soundtrack that is just as enjoyable to listen to today. We had an ""Eddie and the Cruisers Night"" when we received the discs and watching the 2 movies back to back was fun! Of course, because 3 of the main characters from the original were absent, there were the obvious flaws in the editing of one storyline to the second, but that was fun too.  It's good nostalgia if you are into that.

I've been thrilled to acquire some old movies with a cult following, thru Amazon.com as well as some music by Ann-Margaret and Bruce Willis and a CD of a long-lost favorite album, by Santana.  Back to Mr Pare'...he starred in a short-run TV series on the Houston PD, with another actor who looked like a Gibbs brother, back in the '80's, also; during another time of economic recession...so maybe the lack of ad money had something to do with why they didn't last.  I think Pare' is a mix of the Brando/Dean and Elvis type mystiques and he's got an appeal that captures a diverse audience, of both sexes and all ages.  Many thought these movies were a take-off on the demise of rocker, Eddie Cocheran.  I think they are great entertainment, to be watched over a big bowl of popcorn, any time and many times.  Great idea for the gals when the guys are in the middle of football season, for instance.  Amazon's always got what I'm looking for.  Been a faithful customer since day one, for reason's, just like this.  I liked it better than the 1980's blockbuster, LaBamba; or, at least, in a different sort of way.",1246838400,,1328,4.458677685950414

Anyway, Dad had a listen, liked what he heard and the rest is history.

I tested the stregth of the music with Eddie Lives (Eddie and Cruisers II), by putting the CD,on at a very slow party, my girls were having.  Well, away went Running thru the Fire, the feet started tapping, then the dancing and the party went all nite.

I have since been my own showcase, by getting my friends etc to listen to the music.

I was amazed to find that John Caffety and the Beaver Band were the musos, and they also play the theme music for Days of Our Lives.

Things went along, and I saw advert in Amazon website for two in one. immediately ordered it. So now I watch/listen once [at least] per fortnight.  Plus I have burned CD in car.

2478049,3,B000E0RN8S,"I loved the first movie and can easily give it 5 stars - It is a ""cult classic"" and one of the best ""Prism"" (Now defunct Philly area cable service) movies of all-time but Eddie Lives (which I hadn't seen prior to buying the DVD) is one of (if not THE) worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching - I got 2/3 through EL before finally give up for my own sanity - I can watch bad movies but EL was unwatchable and like I said I LOVE E&TC - Sorry EL fans, the music and acting was bad - Maybe they spent all the budget getting Michael Pare to do the sequel - He looks like DiNiro in EL next to the people off the street they got to act in the movie - EL is so painful that only the solace I gain from writing how bad it was makes me feel any cleaner after watching it - Eddie may live but a part of my soul died from watching that garbage - Thanks for indulging me - BTW it is worth the price of the movie for E&TC, just for god's sake don't flip the disc over!",1238371200,2,971,3.7881773399014778

2478054,5,B000E0RN8S,"I've watched these movies at least 20 times over the years and never get tired of watching them. Eddie and the Cruisers takes you to a period in time when music was everything. These were the days when you rushed to the music store to get the newest 45 rpm record that came out that week.
You'd get together with your buddies and grab your guitars and figure out what the chords were that the band was playing and you practiced til you got it down.

This was the age of innocense, rock and roll at it's peak. If you lived through this era, (even if you didn't) these movies will take you on a magnificent journey in time and let you experience what it was like to be in a rock band. If you wern't in a band, you knew someone who was and you lived and breathed the music.

John Cafferty has created a musical gem here and Michael Pare' does an excellent job portraying Eddie Wilson.

The music is what makes this movie go as it should be with one of the best rock and roll movies of all time. A must have for any baby boomer and something for today's youth to watch and get a history lesson as to what music really means. Not some mp3 crap that you download and listen to for a week and discard.

Like Eddie says in the movie ""I want to wrap ourselves up in our music and that it will live on forever"".",1236211200,21,1301,4.090196078431372

(1988)(Totally Awesome 80s Double Feature)</a>.  I was a bit disappointed that I got two movies on one disc, but that's okay since I wanted both movies. Tom Berringer can act, and he carried this film with help from the other actors.  I think they had a good script to work from, and actors that can carry and play off one another.
The first movie was music driven and full of angst.  You began to travel through the memories with the piano player and find things he wasn't aware of, or was just too naive to accept as true.  It's a surprise ending that you suspect, but can't really believe.
The second movie, also music driven, is hokey.  The acting by some of the characters is stilted, and fake by others.  Michael Pare, although he is nice to look at (I mean it girls this is sex on two legs), can't seem to pull off the angst ridden character like he did the first time. He also has no help with the acting as the other characters are self absorbed and and talk like they don't believe in the character they are playing. The music sequences are fun and the end of the movie almost reaches what the movie strives for. I would have bought this movie separately because it's a sequel to the first, but in this case I'm glad I don't have to.
But for all that I just can't help myself.  It's like watching a train wreck, you just can't look away.  And for some reason that I'm not even sure of - I love these movies.",1221436800,,1718,4.9825174825174825

It was just a ""cool"" premise and people fell in love with the lost Eddie. The music on this is fantastic, at least to lots of us. Michael Pare` embodies the songs he sings. Even knowing that it was John Cafferty singing, the voice was strangely similar to Pare`s natural speaking voice. At any other time, Cafferty doesn't sound like this. So the movie was special in several ways and people loved it. Enough so that in 1989, Eddie and the Cruisers 2 was released with more of Cafferty's music. I feel this was even better than number one. You also see a lot more of Pare` who I think absolutely ""made"" the role. The movie has a lot of fire in it and great music along with subtle humor.

2478158,3,B000E0RN8S,"A while back,a friend of mine who was really into movies would occasionally organize what he called a ""schlock festival"", which meant a trip to the local video rental store(remember those?) to get the worst movies we could find. Now I'm not saying that the Eddie And The Cruisers films are the worst movies in the world but they would certainly be schlock festival-worthy. These movies are so cheesy they could be stocked in the deli counter at your local grocery store. Eddie I just flat takes itself too seriously. Isn't rock & roll supposed to be fun?You'd think that Eddie was struggling to compose something like Mozart's Requiem instead of bouncy two and a half minute pop tunes. And Ellen Barkin's acting is similar to a mannequin with animated lips. How many times does she say ""Frank"" before each sentence?I lost count. Even with all this stinkiness going on,I still enjoyed the movie. Know why?I know this sounds corny but here goes:words and music. John Cafferty's soundtrack turns what could have been a truly wretched little movie into something kind of good. I think Eddie II is actually a better film than the first one because for two minutes it actually looks like Eddie is having fun. The delectable Marina Orsini could be the reason for Eddie's newfound happiness. And who couldn't love names like ""Quinn Quinley"",""Rick Diesel"" and ""Hilton Overstreet""?Geez,those names sound like they could be members of a fake band.....wait a minute. They are! Once again,John Cafferty carries the load with another batch of jaunty pop & roll songs. I also like the fact that the guy who plays the president of Satin Records looks like a chunky Leon Redbone. Both Eddie films are presented in non-anamorphic widescreen(1.85:1) with a soundtrack recorded in Dolby 2.0. Considering the large amount of music in these films,you'd think that the studio would have gone for at least Dolby 5.1(yummy DTS is probably out of the question)but I guess we wouldn't be getting two movies for ten bucks if that was the case. The Dolby 2.0 is surprisingly good in Eddie I with clear sound and a good amount of bass. Unfortunately,Eddie II goes the other way by not having much bass at all. I guess Sal Amato was deemed more worthy than Quinn Quinley by the bass gods. Eddie I's picture quality is decent for the most part but tends to get grainy in spots and its blacks aren't well-defined. Eddie II fares much better by having a clearer picture with few defects and more vibrant colors than Eddie I.For some reason,Eddie I's colors looked a bit washed out on my newer Samsung player but were much brighter on my older Philips machine. I'm not sure why. These movies are definitely worth the ten dollar asking price. Bring 'em to your next schlock festival.",1213574400,6,2747,4.7974683544303796

Revised 9/2/2009

Eddie Lives! is indeed anamorphic.  I have been complaining so much lately about reviews by people who haven't seen the dvds and I went back and found I made this review before I had the dvd.  Sorry.

2478161,5,B000E0RN8S,"The Film Eddie and the Cruisers was a throw back to bands of the fifties. It was the story of a band, however there was also a mystery regarding Eddie disappearance. It was a small film that ran in theaters and vanished without a trace. It was an art house film that was done well, but when it was released in the movie theaters got NO audience

The reason this film got a sequel was due to pay cable. This movie built up a cult following when in was on cable movie TV (HBO,SHOWTIME,etc). Most wanted the answers the first film left unresolved questions. You must understand, this is before cable had shows like Dexter, Six feet Under, The Tutors and others (including a MOB show which is NOT my favorite)

The sequel which was not as good as the first (there are never many where the sequel is better than the original). However it did rap up the storylines left unfinished by the first film

These two films are a cult classic. The talented Micheal Pare stars in both films as Eddie Wilson. He showcases the mind of a man who loves the music...its sounds, its feeling. He is brash in the film film. By the sequel, he is wiser, smarter and older. The second he is haunted by the demons of the past

If you are seeking great filmmaking, don't get this. BUT if you seek a story which will interest you, this double feature is a sure bet for an evening entertainment. and that in my book is worth five stars

The original was so tragic and I hated how it ended. I just couldn't understand why he would just disappear all those years. So when I finally got this and watched part 2 I was PISSED. Why disappear only to come back 20 years later and be the same person. Rembrandt only came out of hiding as he was dying and went to the hospital,so since he wasn't dying but the folks knew who he was I felt he should've handled it better. He only found the need to find Sal but he owed piano man,the manager and Joann the same courtesy. They all took his death bad and should've gotten an explanation as well. That really disappointed me. If he was gonna continue to hide then why put yourself back out there with a new band. He could've just reunited with the old band and take advantage of all the new interest surrounding them.
