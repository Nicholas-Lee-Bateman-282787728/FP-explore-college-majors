5528272,5,B006MQ34AY,"This DVD is a nice blend of different yoga styles.  The flow is nicely paced; good for a beginner, yet still challenging enough for more advanced students.  If you are a beginner, watching the pose breakdown first is helpful. And the music is great!",1325548800,,249,4.636363636363637
5528273,5,B006MQ34AY,"As a Chiropractor, I recommend yoga to all my patients. Finding the right DVD, that they can do at home, is quite a challenge but I finally found it! This Yoga DVD is perfect for beginners who need a gentle approach or can be more demanding for those more experienced yogis. The beautiful music drew me in immediately and Malaurie Barber won me over. I love that not everyone in the class looks perfect! If you are looking for a great way to fit yoga into your life, this is the DVD to buy.",1325548800,,490,4.223404255319149
5528274,5,B006MQ34AY,This video is perfect.  I've been doing yoga for a few years now and this video is great for doing yoga at home.  My daughters and I did this video together and it was perfect.  They have never done yoga before so went through the tutorial of all the poses.  Great for beginners and challenging for those who have done yoga before.  Definitely worth the buy!,1325116800,3,358,4.363636363636363

5528278,5,B006MQ34AY,"I realize as a 51 year old male that likes to run, mountain bike ride and work out with weights; I need a way to become more flexible to help avoid injuries caused by being too tight.  I've been saying I would like to begin a yoga practice for years so when my wife bought Not Your ""Everyday"" Yoga, I gave it a shot.  Malaurie clearly and calmly communicates how to do each pose, while you watch her students perform the moves.  It is easy to understand, peaceful but really made me work.  The DVD has been really helpful to me while I work toward my goal of being more flexible.",1330732800,,579,4.1891891891891895

I highly recommend this special yoga video to any and all in search of solitude and a wonderful yoga teacher.",1329782400,,299,4.769230769230769
5528280,5,B006MQ34AY,Malaurie has made a DVD that is just like one of her fabulous yoga practices.  Easy to follow and as always Malaurie's soothing demeanor and instruction enhances the experience even for the most novice amongst us. Easily adaptable to all levels.  Absolutely the perfect yoga DVD to have on hand when you can't make it to class or especially if you aren't fortunate enough to have one to attend.  LOVE IT!,1329004800,,404,4.661971830985915
5528281,5,B006MQ34AY,"Loved it! finally, a dvd that offers something for everyone - whether you are an instructor or an enthusiast, this is a useful addition to your portfolio! It communicates the many ways in which yoga will benefit your life straight from the practitioner's mouth; demonstrates clearly and effectively how to execute each pose at home when you can't get to a studio ...and, a great recommendation for the traveling executive too! All round enjoyed it!",1327881600,,448,4.986666666666666
5528282,5,B006MQ34AY,"Malaurie's 'from the inside out' style of Yoga is strong and empowering.  If you close your eyes you can really feel the difference.  Coming straight from the heart, it's a joyful experience.  This DVD is a lifesaver for those times when I'm traveling, or cannot make it to class.  I plan to share it with friends who talk about trying a Yoga class, because I think it's also a wonderful introduction to the practice.",1327536000,,417,4.594594594594595
5528283,4,B006MQ34AY,This DVD is perfect for a home session when you can't get to class or want a good refresher of all the poses and routines. It provides valuable information to the novice and still allows you to get a good workout in.,1326931200,,216,4.166666666666667
5528284,5,B006MQ34AY,This is the perfect dvd because anyone is capable and she shows different variantions of poses so people at all levels can do it. It also ends with a very nice meditation.

5528285,5,B006MQ34AY,"Simple, facilement comprehensible meme si on ne maitrise pas l'anglais parfaitement grace aux postures de yoga detailles une par une . Un vrai plaisir.",1326240000,,151,5.333333333333333
5528286,5,B006MQ34AY,"I have been practicing yoga for several years.  I prefer to do yoga in studio, in a class setting because I feed off of the class and the teacher's energy.  Can't always make it to class and yoga is a part of my daily life so I am always in search of good DVDs that I can do from home or on the road.  This works for both, in my DVD player or laptop.  I also favor classes that truly represent the mind, body spirit connection that drew me to yoga in the first place.  I get that energy, that connection doing this DVD.  I can close my eyes and feel like I'm in class.  The flow is good.  This is a good DVD for beginners or those who have been practicing for a while.  The instructor does a good job of explaining pose modifications or advanced poses. I love the fact that she tells you to honor where you are.  I also enjoy the kundalini poses.  If would highly recommend this DVD if you are looking for a good flow DVD, that's not your everyday.",1325808000,,948,4.043010752688172
8559153,5,B006MQ34AY,My go to video when I can't make it to the studio. Took Malaurie's  classes for years while living in SoCal and she is truly a gifted teacher.,1480896000,,142,4.071428571428571
8559154,3,B006MQ34AY,"This is a decent yoga class for advanced beginners. The instructor's accent is unusual, however, and she is not as encouraging as I would have liked.",1469577600,,149,4.769230769230769
8559155,5,B006MQ34AY,"This DVD was gifted to me and I love it!  Malaurie is a fantastic and patient teacher both on video and in person.  The video is great no matter what level you are, she always reminds you to honor your own body and make it your practice.  The video is good whether you have a large collection of yoga dvd's or if this is your first venture into them.",1459555200,,350,4.043478260869565
8559156,5,B006MQ34AY,"I was exposed to yoga via P90X and really enjoyed it.  I wanted to try a yoga routine done by a yoga expert (not that the p90x routine wasn't good, but was very ab-focused).  This DVD is excellent.  My wife and I have been doing this for several months now and we look forward to it every day.  I was having some serious problems with a spasming rhomboid in my back and the issue is completely resolved due to this routine.  I was not very flexible and had very little yoga experience but I was able to just follow along.  I feel like I'm getting more out of this routine every time I do it.  I really can't say enough good things about it.  It's a true blessing.",1382400000,3,663,4.125
8559157,5,B006MQ34AY,"As a student, I frequently lack the time and money to do yoga as often as I would like. I bought this DVD having a background in both Hatha and Kundalini myself and I was excited about the blend... It was even better than I expected!!
First, I've been doing yoga for a few years now (with a few months hiatus here and there). This DVD pushed me just far enough and left room for me to feel like I can improve. Definitely something I am looking forward to incorporating into my morning routine.
Second, Malaurie's ability to blend the stretching flows of Hatha with the breathing and meditative state of Kundalini is exactly what I wanted.
I couldn't ask for a better yoga DVD to start my at home work outs!",1373328000,,706,4.356060606060606
8559158,5,B006MQ34AY,This yoga video is very complete in the sense that Malaurie's instructions are easy to follow and she has good explanations of the poses. I love this DVD and it encourages me to practice.,1370390400,,187,4.529411764705882
8559159,5,B006MQ34AY,Wonderful Yoga DVD for those of us who like to practice at home.  Malaurie is a great instructor and brings a calming and positive spirit to this session.  Most of the poses are manageable for those of us who practice one a week. I am a marathon runner and typically do yoga once a week for cross training.  I might add another day of yoga with this great video.  Highly suggest it!,1360281600,2,382,4.263888888888889
8559160,5,B006MQ34AY,"I had been wanting to try yoga for a long time, but I always hesitated because I'm everything but flexible. Having seen Malaurie's trailer for the DVD convinced me to give it a shot. Trying my first yoga session in the comfort of my own home without anyone watching was perfect.  As Malaurie explains in her interview as well as during class, you don't have to take yourself so serious. In fact, I laughed out loud at myself several times throughout the session. It provides the perfect balance of a mind and body workout with a healthy dose of fun. As someone who works out with a trainer 4-5 times a week in the gym this DVD really complements my routine.  The breathing techniques Malaurie teaches even help me during my conditioning and endurance workouts.  I like that the DVD includes intro chapters that explain the different poses. It's perfect for someone who doesn't practice yoga on a regular basis or is new to it all.

This DVD definitely deserves 2 thumbs up!  Malaurie did a great job and I hope to see this series expand.",1343260800,,1037,4.553763440860215
8559161,5,B006MQ34AY,"Loved this yoga DVD.  It is perfect for those days I can't get to the studio.  The tutorials are a good review for me, but would also be very helpful for someone new to yoga. Malaurie has a very relaxed style that gently encourages as well as instructs.  She also offers alternative poses so no matter where you are on any given day you can personalize your practice.  The outtakes are fun too because it reminds you that yoga isn't perfection it is practice.  I would recommend this DVD to beginners and those with experience alike.",1343088000,,533,4.510416666666667
8559162,5,B006MQ34AY,Malaurie did a great job with this DVD!  I love her personalized approach for each individual depending on their level.  It is a good fresher on the basics as well as more challenging poses. I am a student of Malaurie's and travel a lot for work.  I love that I can take the DVD on the road with me and practice while travelling or during those busy weeks when I can't make it to the studio.  Great buy!,1334361600,,403,4.128205128205129
