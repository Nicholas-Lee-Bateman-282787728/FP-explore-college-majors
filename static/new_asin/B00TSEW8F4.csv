8703006,4,B00TSEW8F4,"An intelligent, frosty character study of a French serial killer of young girls, based on a real case from the 1970s.  The super dark anti-hero is played with subtlety by Guillaume Canet, and the film is very well shot.

But theres a layer missing that keeps this from rising from an interesting, well done film to a great one.  The film has has neither the emotional ability to force us to relate to the killer in spite of ourselves, nor the depth of observation to let us see inside his head, even if we stay emotionally removed.

So were left with some fascinating enigmatic behavior.  But the lack of a sense of larger meaning, theme or context keeps this confined to being a thriller (if an intelligent thoughtful one) and not a film that transcends into something larger and more memorable.  Still worth seeing as a fan of the genre, and Ill watch it again sometime to see if it grows on repeat viewing, but for now it seems that frustrating thing: a good film that had the potential to be a great one.",1469836800,,1008,4.451086956521739
