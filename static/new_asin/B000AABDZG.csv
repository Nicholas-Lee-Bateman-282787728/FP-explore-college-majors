8076829,1,B000AABDZG,"Forgive my rant, but this very well might be the worst movie I have ever seen.  Not only is it not even remotely funny - the only people I could see laughing are unintelligent eighth-graders whose fathers used to be frat-boys and who find farts, groin shots, and sex jokes as the pinnacle of all things humorous, and I even question if they would laugh - and poorly made, the entire movie looking as though it were shot and edited in a high-school film class, and not by anyone with talent, but by students who took the class just because they thought it would be easy, and now, with the final approaching, haphazardly threw together some video without really any thought of how the final product would look, but it completely exploits the homeless people involved and its very existence is detrimental to the homeless community.  Yes, that may seem a bit extreme, but unfortunately for everyone involved, it is not.  How this ""dispels stereotypes of the homeless"" is beyond me.  Save a thirty-second title frame where the director explains how he has learned a lot about the homeless while making this movie, it does nothing to examine or commentate on their situation.  If anything, it reinforces the stereotypes placed on the homeless. How does homeless people drinking and acting crazy show us a different side of the homeless community?  He has them dance around making funny faces and performing different tasks as if they were circus animals. He says that they did this on their own volition, but then pays them with money, alcohol, or food.  Apparently, Mr. Patterson doesn't think persuading someone to do something they wouldn't normally do, by promising them something they need or really want, isn't exploitation.  Just because the homeless weren't coerced doesn't mean they weren't taken advantage of.  If you need an example, read up on the recent happenings of the stars of Bum Fights, a similarly brutal and poorly crafted homeless-skit video.  I'm sure they will be happy to tell you all about their exploitation at the hands of a twenty-something looking for some cheap laughs and a little money off DVD sales.  In fact, I've actually been to an event where one of the stars of Bum Fights spoke and he confirmed everything that the critiques of these movies worry about.  Brad Patterson is a disgrace to the title of filmmaker. That this movie won the 2004 Best Comedy Honors at the New York Independent Film and Video festival says nothing about the movie itself, but does lose a lot of credibility on the festivals part.  Bottom line is don't waste your time.",1217462400,2,2579,4.8076923076923075
