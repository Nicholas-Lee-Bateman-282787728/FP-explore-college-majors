5391498,5,B00A7059LI,"This is rather a slow to develop story. It's quiet and thoughtful, but it's worth it to get to the end to find out what happens. I liked it - it's sweet. If you feel like watching something that doesn't hit you over the head with violence or heart-pounding action, then you might like this. Take a chance on it and enjoy.",1366761600,7,321,4.193548387096774
5391499,5,B00A7059LI,"I loved this story. It was different and well done. I love anything Jang Hyuk does as he takes each role and embodies every thing about it. You forget it is him as he becomes the charactor portrayed. This is a different story...gritty but tender. I have seen it twice on Netflix and now will purchase it as I know I will watch it many times more.

5391572,4,B00A7059LI,"I watch mostly historical korean dramas.  This had the same qualities.. I love the ability of the actors and director to allow for the imagination to come to conclusions.  Facial expressions, long moments of silence, camera movements to various xternal objects... many of our US films do not leave anything to the imagination. How unfortunate and boring. I ejoyed this film..slow pace but very impactful.
. America's directors could learn a lot from korean film.  Pam",1446336000,2,467,5.118421052631579
5391573,1,B00A7059LI,"I can't, this was just terrible!  I don't even know what just happened.  I was going to turn it off in the first 15 minutes but decided to see it through.  Note to self, go with first instincts from now on.  2 thumbs down.",1445904000,,222,3.977272727272727

5391576,5,B00A7059LI,I loved this movie.  I just love to look at Jang Hyuk.  His voice and facial expression really makes the movie.  Buy it you will not be disappointed.  I have watched three times since I bought it.,1431907200,,196,4.216216216216216
5391577,1,B00A7059LI,"Slow Movie, with a weak premise for the story. Although the male actor was very good, the storyline just wasn't enough to hold interest. I never did understand the character of the female lead .Too much angst.",1431820800,,209,4.675675675675675

However, this movie is a little bit slow for my taste.  Good concept though.",1427846400,,161,4.333333333333333

5391604,2,B00A7059LI,"So so...I read somewhere that Jang Hyuk I I heard Jang Hyuk is one of the best actors in South Korea. I watched a few of his dramas, include the much talked about Slave Hunters. He just meh and tends to overact. There are lesser known Korean actors who better than him or incredible actors. His acting is predictable.",1425513600,,317,4.389830508474576

5391609,4,B00A7059LI,it got to be a little too much with the woman's repeated attempt  to run away.,1406246400,,78,3.875
5391630,5,B00A7059LI,"As with most Korean dramas of a few years ago, the acting is excellent. Too bad the Koreans followed the US example of violence and sex to replace good scripts and acting.",1404777600,,171,4.375
5391631,3,B00A7059LI,"Love the lead male, have seen in other Korean films and his acting is superb. However, you need to be very patient with this movie which even for me was difficult, to get to the last approximately 20 minutes when it is all pulled together in a way that you can't see coming. The very end could have been a little stronger. So considering the majority of the movie where the director seemed to jump from one scene to another without filling in the details, and the plodding movement of the film (2 stars), to the 4 star pulling together of the film, I rate it 3 stars overall. The greatest point of the film is that nothing happens by coincidence and we tend to meet those people we're supposed to meet, for whatever reasons.",1395705600,,724,4.37037037037037
5391632,1,B00A7059LI,Maybe? The title does not get an answer in the movie. I didn't get it. Maybe what? What kind of lesson they were trying to pass. I didn t understand the end of that movie,1392595200,,170,3.8857142857142857
5391633,4,B00A7059LI,This movie is very sad. The 2 lead characters are both damaged. They find each other by accident and then come to rely on each other. I didn't like the ending to much though. It left to many unanswered questions.,1375056000,2,212,4.325
5391634,2,B00A7059LI,"i love jang hyuk and and have watched tons of korean movies, but despite the other decent reviews, i'd have to say this is not good at all. the female character, may, is very underdeveloped and annoys you because she's constantly pissed over nothing. both characters are actually very underdeveloped, which makes all of the exaggerated emotions seriously irritating. also, i am a second generation korean and there's NO way that an adopted korean child living in the US with american parents would speak korean very well, let alone be intensely angry about being put up for adoption 20-some odd yrs ago. just very unrealistic and a bad premise for a story, in general. i would pass this one - super slow and the ""surprise"" ending is really nothing to hold your breath for.",1374019200,7,772,4.768656716417911
5391635,4,B00A7059LI,I agree with other viewers that this movies is a bit slow. I like the fact that it is about deeper feelings. It is really a nice break from movies involving stormy relationships.,1373155200,,178,4.424242424242424
5391636,4,B00A7059LI,"What can I say? I just love Jan Hyuk. Although he does not have a lot to work with in this movie in the way of character development, he puts his heart into every performance.  Also, the ending took a turn I did not expect.",1372723200,,223,3.9555555555555557
5391637,4,B00A7059LI,"I liked the cinematography and the story that the director and writer were trying to tell.  The acting was good as well.  However, sometimes the execution got on my nerves.  I liked the young man more than the young woman.  I hate it when movies have characters in them that do not respond when someone asks them a question or makes a statement.  The person just looks off into space or walks off.  Normal people don't do that and the young woman did it in this movie way too much for me.  I don't mind slow paced character study movies.  However, when the movie gets to its main point, I want the point to be made loud and clear.  I'm not a fan of ambiguous endings that are left to viewer interpretation.  I had to suspend belief about the ending.  When there is a realization like the one at the end, I would enthusiastically tell everyone in creation, I'm just sayin'. Having said all that, I did enjoy the movie.  I just got the feeling that it was trying to be deeper than it came across.

P.S.  I was recently told that in Korean culture, no response to a question could mean the person did not want to say anything hurtful or may not have known what to say.  So now I understand why the woman acted as she did.  So for that reason I'm going from a three star to a four star.",1371513600,8,1282,4.192622950819672
5391638,5,B00A7059LI,"It was a very romantic movie. I really enjoyed it, epecially the part about how the two of them melt.",1368748800,,101,4.1
5391639,4,B00A7059LI,"First part is a bit redundant with the cat and mouse situation between the girl and the guy but, the attractiveness of the actors kept my interest. Korean perspective regarding foreign adoption (i.e. US)as a ""negative"" for the girl (her life in US was not addressed, however, it appears that she was well cared for).  I did not quite understand why it would be that she was so disturbed by being given up for adoption but, i guess in contributed to the story line.  There is a nice reveal at the end which made watching worthwhile.",1366848000,,531,4.520833333333333
8547528,5,B00A7059LI,"In my top 5 of all time, Yu-ri Sung does an excellent job portraying an adoptee in search and Hyuk Jang is searching for the red rabbit, excellent all the way to the end.",1513900800,,170,4.029411764705882
8547529,3,B00A7059LI,"The star power of Jang Hyuk cannot sustain this tedious movie. If it featured a no-name actor, I would probably not finish the movie. Watch it if you want to kill time but don't expect much from this movie. It is the random and forced encounters of the two main characters that implies some kismet.",1488326400,,298,4.4363636363636365
