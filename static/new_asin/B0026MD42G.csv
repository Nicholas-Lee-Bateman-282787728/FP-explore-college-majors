Creepy and yes educational.",1449964800,,268,5.255813953488372

8353146,3,B0026MD42G,"Don't expect to come away from this with an understanding of how vampire, werewolf, zombie, etc films got their place in human psyche.  Disappointingly, it seems the horror film got its start as a film about how the Devil was always ready to grab people and lead them astray --and how men were paranoid that the socially severely mistreated/oppressed women of the era might get loose from male domination and control and actually behave as thinking adult human beings in their own right.  It's intersting to see that classic horror --ie the vampire/werewolf/etc unrealistic movies-- are actually johnny-come-latelies to a genre that began and has returned in the present day to actual real world horrific human depravity and fear.  Terrors of attack from the mentally ill in both eras, religious fanatic torture such as the Inquisition back then and internet derived mass murder now.  Interesting, but saddening.  I kept fast forwarding through the silent film depictions of atrocities all too real in the middle ages which may seem merely fantasy film stuff to those less informed as to history.

Narration is often difficult to hear, adding an element of annoyance.  You may want to turn up the volume.",1406419200,2,1204,5.05050505050505

8353148,3,B0026MD42G,Lots of emphasis on silent movies. Psychological interpretation not entirely convincing. A good chance to see a few minutes of little-known silents and early films.,1392163200,,164,5.6
8353149,4,B0026MD42G,This was really interesting and gave me a new respect for silent horror films - plus a few to add to my watch list!,1386028800,3,115,3.8333333333333335
8353150,5,B0026MD42G,"I taped this from TV about 10 years ago and was thrilled to find a copy.  This is a must-have for anyone interested in horror films.  It starts out with silent film horror, explains the psychology and evolution of horror films made in different countries and in different eras.  I actually sat with pen & paper and wrote down and bought as many of the silent and early talkie horror films covered in this documentary as I could find.  I now have a collection of early B&W horror films.
It is extremely educational and interesting.",1355788800,12,530,4.5473684210526315
8353151,4,B0026MD42G,"A nice survey course into horror films of the Silent Era. Many films covered. Lots of German expressionism -- Murnau, etc. Good clips from many films of the day, and there were many. Rod Steiger narrates. Good, if you really like Silent films.",1321574400,5,243,4.674418604651163
