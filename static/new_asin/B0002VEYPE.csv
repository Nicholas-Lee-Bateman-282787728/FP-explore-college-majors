2125747,4,B0002VEYPE,"CeCe Winans is such a beautiful woman that it's the only thing distracting on this worship DVD... By the time I got to ""Alabaster Box"", the spirit of worship was so strong that her beauty was no longer a distraction, lol... Sometimes Christians have the misconception that we all have to be drab and dour, so it's nice to see someone who cares about how they present physically as well as spiritually leading a worship service... I still haven't gotten through the whole DVD because I'm trying to save and savor such a special experience that didn't seem like a ""performance"" but rather a full blown worship service... And doesn't God deserve our worship and then some??!! Let this CD help you get to that level..",1116028800,10,713,4.666666666666667
2125748,5,B0002VEYPE,"Wow...CeCe's talent is truly amazing. Most of my favorite songs are performed here, with no disappointment. It's one thing to listen to her cds, but it's quite another to see CeCe perform. Once you have that experience you quickly see that she is honest, humble and real about her work. Her music is not contrived or created to fulfill the expectations of others. She is just a woman who loves God and is not afraid to express that love with the hope of touching the lives of those needing a touch of light or motivation to live better. You will not feel empty after watching this dvd; you will be filled with love, joy and hope that even though each day will bring its struggles and sacrifices you will maintain your sense of self and an even greater respect for your Creator. Thanks CeCe!!",1110758400,17,791,4.5
2125749,5,B0002VEYPE,"What can I say about the very spiritual,great and beautiful CeCe Winans. Her voice is real. This dvd is awesome, it never leaves my dvd player. I have been listening to her ever since her and her brother debut with, ""BeBe & CeCe Winans"" and she sung ""For Always"" after that I was hooked. When she sings I feel a stirring inside me that I have to worship like she does. And do she ever worship, I mean this dvd seems like a non-stop worship,""You're So Holy"", ""Alabaster Box"" & espescially ""Jesus, You're Beautiful.""

 I feel there are few people who can give a concert and just let the spirit move, and CeCe certainly does that, it just comes in and takes over. This woman is truly a woman of GOD. Everytime I listen to this dvd I ALWAYS enter the ""Throne Room.""

 ""I Love It Here!""

GOD Bless",1102896000,5,792,4.2885906040268456
2125750,5,B0002VEYPE,"Cece Winans has the best voice of her generation of singers...NOT JUST GOSPEL SINGER!!!!  Whitney Houston and Cece Winans seemingly have similar vocal techniques and absolute stage presence.  The only difference between the two is the Whitney's LEO attitude of ""Damn, I can sing, I'm pretty, and now I am a millionaire"":)When Whitney sings, you know she is a prfessional.  When Cece sings, you know that she can sing.  Her presence is very spiritual and God-like.  She wants you to understand that.  BUT THAT VOICE IS UTTERLY UNTOUCHABLE!

This DVD is a great display of show...and ....church!  This is more of a service...church service if you will.  If you have purchased any of Cece's CD's over the last 5 years, you will know alll the music.  She looks good, she sounds great and you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!  BUY NOW!!

By the way, I LOVE THIS CONCERT.  ITS BIGGER AND BETTER THATN THE LAST ONE.",1097193600,5,907,4.774193548387097
2125751,5,B0002VEYPE,"This DVD is awesome. She can sing!!!!!wow. This band is amazing, Luther ""Mano"" musical director.

I'm speechless .",1096070400,5,114,5.333333333333333
2125752,5,B0002VEYPE,"If you want a throne room experience get this DVD! The band is amazing (especially the guitarist) as well as the material (musical director is Luther `Mano' Hanes). The songs aren't just from the Throne room CD, actually there really aren't that many when I think about it; included is a rousing moving edition of `Alabaster box' (done a li'l differently) as well as songs such as `I Am' and `King of Kings.'

What I like about it is CeCe is not afraid to perform as well as minister - she has a balance and a natural stage presence different from other female singers I've seen. She even dance's a li'l at the end!!

The lighting is soo cool that if you went and came back you'd think she was performing elsewhere from the previous song.

Another reason it stands out from some of the other DVD's we've seen is the choreography which has to be said is amazing too. It's all choreographed by her son. It's a shame we don't see more of them however. That probably is my only criticism... Oh yeah I have to question the Hallelujah to the King interlude... the ballet wasn't needed. That was a bit boring.

The only one I can see rivalling this is Tonex's one which is out in November.",1096070400,3,1182,4.383561643835616
2125753,5,B0002VEYPE,"This is Classic CeCe at full throttle

Wow what can I say,I have been a CeCe Fan ever since

her 1998 ""Everlasting Love"" Album and I was so happy

that she included it with the ""Throne Room Concert""

it is a personal song for me,one of my favorits.

But I love all of her albums,I have them all even her

first album ""Alone In His Presence"".CeCe really brings

the worship experience to you,you know the presence

of the Lord is there and you know that CeCe is one of

his real children and you get that feelin while witnessing

this wonderful worship experience,the heavens where all

over ""The Throne Room"".Thank you CeCe,you were awesome

when you came to Norfolk,Va at the Ted Constant Center

May of last year,my sister and I will never forget it.

If you are a true CeCe Winans fan,this is a must have.

2125784,1,B0002VEYPE,"Was very displeased with this order, not because of Amazon's ability or not to deliver, but because it was not the best gospel musical performance, I have gained from this Christian artist. I felt I was viewing a slideshow of nightclub demons rather then gaining  religious blessing, I was shocked surprised and very disappointed, though I have not return it.",1413936000,,359,4.983333333333333

This young lady brings the most anointed, worship experience a Believer could want for!  This dvd is a must have for anyone who wants their space invaded by the Presence of God.  I love any and all of CeCe's worship music, but this is project has been delivered from the heart of God, to the Body of Christ!

Outstanding!",1396569600,,333,4.409836065573771
2125786,5,B0002VEYPE,I purchased this DVD a few years ago for myself.  It recently dawned on me that this would be a blessing to others.  I purchased one for my mother and she loves it.,1394582400,,164,3.9393939393939394
2125787,5,B0002VEYPE,"This live concert is awe-inspiring, Jesus-focused, and uplifting. The band was awesome, the recording quality very good, the 3 back-up singers sounded like an entire choir, and of course Cece's voice is pure and smooth - very easy on the ear. What was so special about this concert is how intent Cece was on keeping the focus on Jesus. Even when the crowd was appreciative of the awesome playing and singing, she did not revel in their applause but kept turning their eyes upon Jesus and deflecting the praise to God. This concert truly took the viewer into the throne room.",1377820800,,574,4.693069306930693

2125820,5,B0002VEYPE,"This has to be one of, if not THE best gospel dvd I have ever purchased. The song selection is good, the sound is spectacular even on my little tv and the visual is of very high quality. The concert flows as if you were really there and you will find yourself singing and worshipping along with CeCe. The background singers were on point, the musicians and song arrangements were excellent and the extras are even fun to watch. Professional all the way around. I can't say enough good things about this DVD!",1189382400,,507,4.462365591397849
2125821,5,B0002VEYPE,"I'm a huge Cece fan and have always been, so it was no surprise that I loved this DVD...BUT I'm writing this review 2 years after I purchased it because well, because I watched it last night for the hundredth time and am still in awe of how truly sincere Cece Winans is in worship.

If you've never been blessed with the opportunity to experience her in concert live, this is a wonderful substitute.  Her heart shows in it and it's a wonderful aid and backdrop to personal worship...much like the Throne Room CD...just more intense.  I pop it in anytime and just praise and worship for hours.

Beautiful woman inside and out, beautiful voice, wonderful investment.  This DVD wasn't just a purchase for me, it was certainly an investment as it's bolstered my spirits and worship time many a day.  Heaven forbid, but if I break or loose it....I'd get a replacement copy ASAP!!!",1183593600,,875,4.612903225806452
2125822,5,B0002VEYPE,"Cece Winans has to be the most talented and versatile gospel artist out there today. Hey, I know to all the Yolanda Adams and Karen Clark Sheard fans, you may beg to differ, but once you obtain this DVD you will understand a little more what I'm saying. You can feel the love and deep anointing come straight from your DVD to your heart. Just fast forward to ""Beautiful"" first and then start back at the beginning. If Bebe Winans was on this joint it would just be to explosive to watch. Cece looks so stunning and listen to the background singers because they are no joke! They hit every note that Cece does and thats outstanding for any group whether gospel or R&B. I purchased first recording that was done in New York and I was disappointed because of how dark and dreary everything looked. This is not the case on ""The Throne Room"" It's wonderful! It a blessing and to see her children growing up and sharing the stage makes it that much better. You will not be disappointed when you get this one.",1154390400,2,1002,4.39247311827957
2125823,5,B0002VEYPE,This DVD is simply an overflow and a taste of what true worship is like.  It's genuine and humbling.  Cece is sincere and passionate and it truly shows in this DVD.  I was just thankful that she did this DVD and I was fortunate enough to come across it and purchase it.  It's one of the best things I could have done all year for my faith in 2006.  THRONE ROOM to say the least is an overflow of the anointing on Cece poured into an hour and a half of recording.  Refreshingly anointed***.,1153353600,2,489,4.148936170212766
2125844,5,B0002VEYPE,"This is how a concert should be filmed! Stunning lighting, direction, audio, band, etc. A very pleasing mix of wide shots, side shots, walk-around shots, over audience shots, and many stunning close-up shots.  It could not have been filmed or directed any better!

CeCe is backed by a talented 6 piece jazz/rock band and three vocalists.  This group is fabulous and I expecially enjoyed the Hammand B3 keyboard player, but all are great.  The music is gospel/jazz/rock style with some inspiring slower pieces but many uptempo pieces as well that get Cece and the audience dancing and  jumping and whatever, all in praise to God.

The addition of a group of young dancers on some songs (choreographed by Cece's son I believe) adds to the spirit and fun.  Also included is a well made behind-the-scenes bonus clip that shows all of the hard work and detail that went into putting the large stage and show together.  It really made me appreciate the work involved!

It must be said that CeCe is not just stunningly beautiful and radiant, but also truly humble and this is shown in the very ending of the concert when the band takes the final last bars of music to close the show, in a fabulous energetic musical ending (watch the drummer!). CeCe has graciously stepped aside almost off stage, to let the band shine here.  She could have stayed out front, but instead she stepped out of the spotlight and let the band have their moment of glory, and I know of really no other concert I've seen where a lead singer has ever done the same thing!  CeCe- you are so wonderfull!",1145232000,3,1569,4.628158844765343
2125845,3,B0002VEYPE,As with some of the other DVD's CeeCee does not include some of her more popular selection in this repertoire. The video editing is very good and is a classy product.,1142726400,,166,4.387096774193548
2125846,5,B0002VEYPE,"One of the most anticipated DVDs of 2004, CeCe Winans delivers a superb bevy of greatest hits and more on ""Live in the Throne Room."" Her voice is amazing and her band led by Luther ""Mano"" Hanes (Fred Hammond's co-keyboardist), organist Ernest Dayce, guitarist Rick Watford (from the movie ""The Fighting Temptations"" and Kevin Bond & The G.A.M.E.), percussionist Javier Solis (from Israel & New Breed), LaDell Abrams (one of the baddest drummers ever) and bassist Sharay Reed exercised so much energy in the Cornerstone Church in Madison, TN. This dvd is so detailed and the effects of it make you feel like you are right in the heart of the worship experience. CeCe has blossomed from a neo-contemporary artist to a psalmist as she invokes the presence of God from start to finish. After the band enhances her stage entrance with their fabulous instrumental intro, her smash from 1998, ""Well Alright"" begins the set with its jaunty jazz structure and stylish arrangements. For the most part, every song was portrayed exceptionally well, featuring CeCe's son, Alvin Love's slick choreography with his dance team comprised of youth ranging from ages 12 to 22. Also, the backing vocals of Leanne Palmore, Jerard Woods (lead singer of the Colorado Mass Choir's single ""Speak Life"") and BET's 2004 Gospel Dream winner Benita Washington are astonishing. There is so much in this album to pay attention to! I rank this album alongside greats like ""Out The Box"" and ""Live From Another Level."" Still, CeCe Winans' imprint on the contemporary gospel music scene has been evident in the work ethic she's had for over 20 years in this industry. She's a pioneer in her own right and what makes this album special is the free atmosphere of worship permeating exceedingly through it. From the heartfelt testimony of her brother Ronald Winans (R.I.P.), prior to singing ""Mercy Said No,"" to the enthusiastic ""Hallelujah Praise"" and benediction song, ""Live in the Throne Room"" will absolutely floor you!!! Anyone who doesn't have this DVD, go get it!!!",1135641600,4,2034,5.002949852507375
2125847,5,B0002VEYPE,"This DVD concert is awesome from beginning to end. Cece is in fine form. Her voice sounds great. She also looks stunning. Her band and back-up singers are truly amazing. The dancers also added a lot of energy to the concert. I think that her son choreographed the dancing segments. I only have one complaint and it's minor. Some of the songs are not performed in their entirety. Verses are left out. This is especially true for the song ""King of Kings"". Don't let this discourage you from purchasing this DVD though. The Spirit was definitely in that building on that evening. It's the best DVD concert that I've ever seen. You won't be disappointed...",1133568000,4,652,4.678260869565217
2125848,5,B0002VEYPE,"This is by far the best DVD I have EVER seen! The entire concert was completely amazing, from the stage setting to the dancers to Cece's beautiful voice, and so very anointed; from beginning to end! It truly ushers you into the Throne Room of The Lord. My favorite part was when she invited those, who didn't know the Lord, to come down and receive him as their personal savior; what a testimony! So, if you want to be blessed and learn how to worship the Lord on a whole new level--I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD.",1131840000,,517,4.34020618556701
