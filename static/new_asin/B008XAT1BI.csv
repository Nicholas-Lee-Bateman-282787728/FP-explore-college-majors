5188912,5,B008XAT1BI,"The Chase is more than worth the purchase price of this Hollywood Hits 4-pack Bobby Deerfield package.  The Chase is a classic film with Brando and a young Redford.  Once you wade through the over done, jack-hammer style, stereotypical and not-so-subtle attacks on the south in general and Texas specifically it is a pretty good movie.  If you buy this movie as an individual movie, it will cost you many times the price of this package, if you can find it.  The acting in the Chase is first rate and there is good action.  The rest of the so-so movies in this 4-pack are just a bonus.  *****  5 Stars

The Rain Must Fall is an early Steve McQueen movie with the always beautiful, and ever talented Lee Remick.  It also has Don Murray, Paul Fix, and Josephine Hutchinson, and a long list of stars.  This black and white movie was a pleasant surprise and the best of the lot after The Chase.  It gives a view of Texas back before it was spoiled by the unbridled influx of legal and illegal people from other states and other nations.  A time before political correctness ruled the world, and a time when America was still a place for Americans to work and live free.  A time before air conditioning, when Americans still mowed their own lawns, and most wives worked at home to care for their family.  It was a time before the federal governments progressive policies destroyed the nuclear family structure in the USA.  The weakest parts of the movie are the lip sync singing and the stunt work in the fighting by McQueen, which is pretty weak.  Also McQueens acting is not yet fully developed in this one, but the other stars are right on which makes this one worth watching.  **** 4 Stars

Bobby Deerfield is one of those slow European style movies that has almost no action.  It is just a romantic interaction of two strange people as envisioned by an even stranger person.  If you like those types of movies it is ok, as the female lead is a good actress, and actually steals the show from Pacino, which is no small feat.  Clearly this is not the best type of role for Pacino.  It is just not my kind of movie and varies from some interesting personal interaction to downright boring.  Some would call it a chick flick, and I would not argue with that.  Lets just say it will have mixed reviews and some will like it fine, and others will be bored to tears.  *** 3 Stars

Ship of Fools is a very foolish, boring movie full of early political correctness politics.  It is Sad that such movies were made, much less watched.  It is best described as an early liberal communist propaganda film.  * 1 Star is too much for this one.",1402012800,10,2628,4.416666666666667

5188914,5,B008XAT1BI,"Bobby Deerfield was obviously one of Al Pacino's earlier movies, but what's not to like about Al Pacino.  I really enjoyed the character he played, and found it to a very heart-warming story.  You throw in Marlon Brando and Steve McQueen in the other movies, and there's a lot of value here for your money.",1368316800,12,306,4.545454545454546

8531974,4,B008XAT1BI,Loved it! Looks like an action film when it is actually a rare love story. Beautifully filmed in Europe with fine acting by Pacino and Keller. I appreciated the unusual and off beat social connections between Bobby (Pacino) and ordinary Italian people. Martha Keller is a rare beauty and plays the part exceptionally.,1480809600,,317,5.0

8531980,2,B008XAT1BI,"4 movies thrown into a box. The infamous Pacino flop ""Bobby Deerfield"" is worth seeing, ""Ship of Fools' is a classic film and should never be thrown away on a crappy package like this, ""The Chase"" features Brando in a great role in a mediocre movie that should be so much more. Directed by Arthur Penn (""The Miracle Worker"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"") Horton Foote wrote the play, Lillian Hellman wrote the screenplay, the supporting smaller roles are filled by Jane Fonda and Robert Redford, and it was produced by Sam Spiegel who did ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Steve McQueen and Lee Remick try hard to make ""Baby the Rain Must Fall"" work. It just doesn't.",1434412800,2,676,4.641666666666667
