6858957,1,B00BL0MGB4,"I'm surprised that this production, which has gotten so many bad reviews from critics, is rating so well on Amazon. To me it was an overly traditional production void of any personality.  It was empty, both figuratively of emotion and drama and literally with the stage set.  I don't understand how it was marketed as spectacular and revolutionary when it was really boring and despite the gigantic Machine, quite a small production with not much going on.

The singing is top notch but if you're not going to enjoy the visuals you might as well get yourself any other Ring Cycle.

6858958,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This cycle was not perfect. I would like to preface my review saying that, yes, this Ring cycle has flaws. Yet, it is a bold step into the future. The Met's new Ring Cycle has been incredibly controversial and there is some reasoning behind that. Many do not like the use of the ""Machine"" and feel that the set and blocking detract from rather than add to Wagner's epic. I disagree with these statements. For the vast majority of the Cycle, the machine is stationary. It transforms mostly (though not entirely) in the scene changes, where the orchestra does a nice job of hiding some of the mechanical noises. These scene changes often help to develop the story. I will point to the first scene change in Das Rheingold as an example. While the Otto Schenk production (the previous Met version) uses a veil of smoke to make the transition from the Rhein to Valhalla, the Lepage cycle is able to change and develop with the music and eventually comes to the Valhalla formation. I loved the boldness of this production and I feel that it adds a level of grandeur to the cycle. It is also incredibly important to note that this ring cycle is set, as Wagner intended, in the World of Wagner's creation. No attempt is made to change the story to fit a different setting as many companies have done lately. This is to the Met's credit, and this alone is deserving of my recommendation of this DVD.

Secondly, the music. This is, of course, the most important element, and it is here that some of my complaints with this cycle lie. Granted that this is a live recording and that there is no such thing as a perfect ring cycle, I try to be generous, but I will still voice some of my concerns. Bryn Terfel plays the god Wotan. He does a fair job of this, but Wotan is the meatiest role in his repertoire (not that this is unusual in past Wotan interpreters). Still, he shows some fatigue by the end of Die Walkure and he occasionally seems to be fighting the orchestra more than most other Wotans do. Still, his lyric experience pays off and many of Wotan's most important melodies and moments are soaring and beautiful. Deborah Voigt is one of my favorite singers and I was ecstatic to hear her Brunhilde. She is an inexperienced portrayer of that role, which means that there is development that is yet to come. Still, her fresh interpretation was wonderful and I look forward to seeing how she changes her interpretation over the following years. Jay Hunter Morris's Siegfried had me really worried as I approached my favorite of the four operas, Siegfried. I watched his ""Nothung"" on youtube and was dismayed to hear him trying to sing it like it was Puccini, with focus on melodic line and a certain lack of Wagnerian power. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed his interpretation and loved the way that he developed the character. He was not a perfect Siegfried, but he gave a great cohesive performance. Stephanie Blythe is perhaps my favorite casting decision. Her Fricka is strong, independent and well developed. Her singing was spot on and I have no complaints. Jonas Kaufmann is a young tenor to be singing Wagner, but I was amazed at his interpretation of Siegmund. His characterization was perhaps a little indifferent for my taste, but I loved his interpretation overall. Eva-Maria Westbroek was a very good Sieglinde, but she did not meet the high standard set by Jessye Norman in the Met's last DVD. Her voice is appropriate for the role and well suited to sing with Jonas Kaufmann. I really enjoyed Eric Owen's Alberich, which was complex and as sympathetic as Alberich can be. His singing was beyond reproach. The entire cast lived up to a high standard and I was favorably impressed musically.

One addition that I would like to make is that with James Levine's unfortunate health problems and Fabio Luisi taking the helm for the final 2 operas, the production gained a slight disjointed feeling and much of the development of the story was changed. The orchestra is the most important character in the Ring Cycle and every orchestra and every conductor approach this character differently. The unfortunate thing for us is that Levine's set up for the story is dark and brooding and full of symbolism (a spectacular interpretation), while Luisi's is more of a storyteller's interpretation, where the orchestra underscores the action and gives the characters room to breathe and come to fruition (another spectacular interpretation). The change from one to the other is my biggest problem with this DVD set. It is unfortunate, yet unavoidable.

BOTTOM LINE:
I recommend this DVD set. It is a solid Ring Cycle and an approachable production filled with all of the music, adventure, excitement and intrigue that Wagner lovers have come to expect and demand.",1344988800,148,4778,4.733493397358943
6858959,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This Robert Lepage Ring IS a controversial production. I saw all four operas live at the Met and also in the simulcasts, which make up the DVD/Blu-ray sets. It's true that some aspects of the 'Machine' work better than others. It's also true that many are visually extraordinary---the Rhine Maidens, the descent into Nibelheim, the forest scene in Siegfried with the virtual bird, the immolation scene. The advantage of these discs is that none of the problems are included---the falls, delays or groans of the set as it changed position. The disadvantage is that aspects improved upon after the simulcasts can't be included such as the changes in visual projections and staging.

That being said, Opera really is all about the singing, and for its new Ring, the Met assembled a world-class cast of singers who are also good actors, essential for simulcasts. Bryn Terfel is a commanding Wotan in Das Rheingold, a young but troubled god whose  world is beginning to spin out of control through his own machinations. He is well-matched by Stephanie Blythe as Fricka and Eric Owen in a real star-turn as Alberich.

Much time passes before Die Walkure takes place, a long but intimate opera. The Valkyries, Fricka and Hunding appear in crucial but brief scenes, but it is left to those singing the roles of Wotan, Brunnhilde, Siegmund and Sieglinde to carry the opera. This is an opera about love, the unraveling marriage of Wotan and Fricka, the incestuous love of Sieglinde and Siegmund and the deep and problematic love of Wotan for his mortal son and immortal daughter. Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek not only sing with great passion as the twins, they actually look like young lovers, something not always the case in opera. Bryn Terfel is once again an excellent Wotan, older angrier, sometimes remorseful, but with much more to work with in this opera. The scene where Siegmund dies in his arms is poignant, and the interaction between him and Deborah Voigt's young, willful Brunnhilde is both moving and well-sung, especially Wotan's long 'Farewell' as he places her in the Ring of Fire to await the coming hero.

Siegfried, often the least popular of the four operas, is important here for two reasons. It has by far the best utilization of the 'Machine.' It also has Jay Hunter Morris, the 'cover' who was called on during the dress rehearsal to sing the title role. And he's good, successfully portraying the hero as a teenager as he moves from forging his own sword to (hours of singing later) passing through the Ring of Fire and falling in love with Brunnhilde.

Morris and Voigt continue their roles in Gotterdammerung, which features other superb singers most notably Waltrude Meier as Waltraute, Iain Paterson as Gunther and Hans-Peter Konig as Hagen who wins the 'baddie' award in this Ring as he also sings the roles of Fafnir and Hunding.

There are many Older Ring Cycles out there for sale, but Older does not always mean Better. Yes the dragon here looks like a pool toy and yes, the gold covering Freia doesn't even come close to being enough and looks exactly like my son's old plastic toy armor. But these are very small matters and easily fixed. This production places the operas exactly where they belong, in the mythic time and place that Wagner, according to his notes, wanted. The Lepage Ring proves that the words Opera and Computer-generated can co-exist favorably in the same sentence. As I sat through the four operas I heard audience members' reaction to the 'Machine' go from skepticism to acceptance to enthusiasm. I saw it in myself. But I also heard enormous praise for the singers, the orchestra and James Levine who began as the conductor and Fabio Luisi who completed the task. This new Ring is worth the price and more so. Stick with it. You won't be disappointed.",1344816000,295,3812,4.838957055214724
6858960,1,B00BL0MGB4,"Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that ""pound for pound, ton for ton, it is the most witless and wasteful production in modern operatic history."" Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that while ""the machine represents a breakthrough in stage technology,"" it was ""the most frustrating opera production I have ever had to grapple with.""

They were right.  If this production were marketed as a minimalistic  produciton and the DVD price was not so high I would have let a lot more pass. There are Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars productions far blander than this, but the difference is that Lapage offers no perspective.  Not to belittle the work of the other parts of the production, but this is a staging that the Met should be ashamed of.  And worst of all, the audacity to call this Ring a perfect realization of Wagner's vision is an affirmation that things at the Met is utterly in denial, and for that, this deserves 1 star.

The production is centered on one innovation--a machine of rotating planks that at first showed a lot of promise but quickly turned into gimmick and finally into an eye-sore.  Let's start at the beginning: Das Rheingold is easily the most impressive of the cycle.  It opens with the machine in a vertical position, with the Rhine-maidens slowly descending upwards as if swimming in the Rhine.  The machine acts as a backdrop with images of bubbles and falling sand, which somewhat react to the singer's voices.  This scene is visually impressive and is made remarkable mostly due to Eric Owen's fantastic Alberich.  Other interesting bits, such as the rainbow bridge and the descent into Nibelheim, show that Lapage did have some great ideas.  But it's in the other parts that actually show Lapage's clumsiness and laziness--a seriously static Scene 2 and Scene 3 where the machine is just either gray or brick red, in the form of stairs that add nothing but blandness to the scene.

Die Walkure affirms the fact that the machine is just a really low-quality background projection.  Act I's empty stage with a table, two chairs, and a fuzzy wood background is not genius, but at least the performances of Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek made it bearable.  The problem here is that the staging has nothing to say--no new insight into the story.  And although this in itself is not a problem, the problem is that at least did not offer anything nice or interesting to look at. The Ride of the Valkyries was just silly; watching them sliding down the planks of the machine was a little embarrassing, although musically it was fantastic. The Magic Fire scene was the only impressive scene, with Brunhilde's obvious double, hanging backwards from the top of the distorted machine.

Siegfried plunges into greater catastrophe, where the machine becomes a glorified background screensaver.  What's worse is that nothing--not the machine or the singers--seem to be aware what is going on with the music.  Everything is so disjointed, with no direction or plan.  The costumes, projected nature images and set pieces (placed in a trench) are all smoothly naturalistic--that is, it looks like the wallpaper selection of a new Mac, with no character or aura.

Gotterdammerung is by far the most embarrassing of all.  It's not a good sign when the Immolation scene solicits laughs from the audience.  A small funeral pyre of logs is built upstage. Brnnhilde lights it on fire and mounts her skeletal Grane and is rolled SO SLOWLY towards it. The music soars fantastically but we are not allowed to enjoy it due to the fact that what is going on the stage is so UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.  The Machine rotates her out of view, and the machine is covered with the lamest and fuzziest projections of flames. Then little plastic statues of the gods are risen awkwardly at the top of the Machine and their heads just fall off, then they are lowered out of view.  The water screensaver is cued and then it's over...

No amount of new cuts or edits can change the fact that this staging, and the fact that people defend it and prefer it so, is one of the main reasons that the Met is quickly falling as the best opera house in the U.S.  Rent this just so you can see how bad a Ring Cycles can get.",1344816000,79,4217,4.717598908594816
6858961,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This is a supurb production in all respects.  I saw it several times in the movie theater with the original showing and the encores.  The more I saw it, the more I liked it.  The singing is fantastic with a stellar cast.  I like the production as well, even though it is a modernized version as compared to the MET's previous production.  The projections of the forest and Rhine were excellent as well as the other special effects.  The bonus of the additional video is a major plus for buying this full set.  Go out and buy it, you won't be disappointed.  Don't buy the trashy European versions of this music masterpiece.

6858962,5,B00BL0MGB4,"I got a chance to see all four broadcasts of this legendary opera cycle in its new Met Production at my local theater and what a delight it was. While I am not classically trained in music or technically proficient, I do have eyes and ears, and truly appreciated and was awe-struck by the marvel of the theatrical experience on display. I have been eagerly anticipating the home viewing premiere of this performance and now it is here. The consistency in casting, conducting, and sets and costumes, lighting and photography are all stellar. And, of course the music, Wagner's most inspired and grandest creation. I've seen most of the Rings available on video, and this one goes right to the top of the list. Included is the wonderful full length documentary on the making of this astonishing new production 'Wagner's Dream' by Susan Froemke. You don't even have to like opera or Wagner to appreciate this included film, but if you're like me, and love this new production, 'Wagner's Dream' will be a pleasure cruise. 5 stars!!!",1344729600,35,1028,4.813559322033898
6858963,1,B00BL0MGB4,"Given how many excellent sets of DVDs are available of Wagner's protean Ring cycle, the person who buys this particular set must have money and hours to burn.  While parts of this production are truly wonderful, most of it is truly appalling. I need only remind those who have seen this on HD simulcast of the dragon in Siegfried. Do we really need Kukla of Kukla Fran and Ollie at this moment? Again, think of the scene with the Norns at the beginning of Gotterdammerung.  Does anybody have any idea what is going on or what is being sung? Who are these women? And what have they done with the Norns?

Many of the voices are terrific, such as Jonas Kauffmann's Siegmund, but Eva Marie Westbroek's Sieglinde does not match it in vocal beauty. Deborah Voigt's Brunhilde is ragged and strained.  Bryn Terfel sings and acts a fervent Wotan, but his voice is a little light.  On the other hand, Stephanie Blythe's Fricka might just be worth the price of the set.

The staging can be stunning, as in Jay Hunter Morris's thrilling traverse of the magic fire in Siegfried.  Too, Wotan and Loge's descent in to Nibelheim is the highlight of the entire production. But the scene in Gotterdammerung when Siegfried breaks Wotan's spear is absolutely baffling.  What on earth is going on?

I could go on and on.  think very long and hard about purchasing this item.  I wouldn't.  I have the Levine Ring designed by Otto Schenk and Gunther Schneider Siemssen, a very traditional set with the sublime James Morris as Wotan.  There are other better sets even than this, but it is a safe bet.",1344384000,54,1576,4.60573476702509
6858964,5,B00BL0MGB4,OK so we all know that the Ring Cycle is very long....so don't watch it all in a day!

The innovative sets may not be to the taste of some but you really do have to at least experience part of it because the sets really are do different from anything I've ever seen prior to this production.

6858970,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This is an excellent introduction to the Ring. The visuals and audio are outstanding compared to other available Ring cycles on Blu-Ray and DVD. The orchestra is quite good, especially under James Levine (first two sessions). The staging has been criticized, but on the whole it is quite good.

I would say that because it is a modern production (with high quality video and sound) and yet is rather traditionally staged, that it makes the perfect introduction to the Ring. The other Ring cycle I have is the Barenboim/Kupfer edition, which is musically superior in my opinion (in terms of the conducting and orchestra), but far less good in terms of the audio-visuals (being an earlier recording, and not very well recorded). I would recommend both, but for different reasons.

Having never seen the Ring before, I have to say that it is a lot more interesting than I had thought. 16 hours of Wagnerian opera seemed like it would be dull, but it's anything but. The story is so gripping, and the singing is so good (and music of course), that you get drawn in easily. We watched it in 4 straight nights.

I found the previous version lacking in vocal quality (with the exception of Alberich and Mime), but the new version is very well sung.  One star off for Siegfried.

6858991,5,B00BL0MGB4,"I have listened to the Ring for almost 50 years.  I have multiple sets on CD and Vinyl and have seen several versions on DVD and Blu-ray.
This review is of the Blu-ray, not of a performance heard while sitting in the opera house. I am not concerned with the wisdom of the Met's management or of the ego of the director, things which some other reviewers for some reason seem to consider important in reviewing this set.

As a Blu-ray it is an exceptional product, and in my view by far the best Ring Cycle available in video form. The quality of the picture and sound (PCM Stereo) are excellent.  I detected no audio problems of the kind I have experienced in other Met productions.  The ""Machine"" and more importantly the projections were imaginative and, with a few notable exceptions, highly successful.  The costumes were traditional and with a couple of exceptions, entirely appropriate.  The singers were more than adequate for the roles. Yes, it is true that Terfel's voice is not ideal for Wotan, and that Voigt is no Nilsson, but overall the singing is quite good.  The acting for the most part is excellent, with the exception of Iian Paterson as Gunther. Special plaudits to Hans-Peter Konig as Hagen/Fafner/Hunding and Eric Owens as Alberich.  Jay Hunter Morris sings beautifully and actually looks like Siegfried should look, young, buff and handsome.  I may be in the minority but I thought the opening scene of Rheingold a perfect beginning.  Act 1 of Walkure was beautifully done, Wotan's farewell at the conclusion of the opera was highly moving.  Siegfried moved along well with the exception of the dragon (see below) and the awakening of Brunnhilde was extremely well done. Morris  is near perfection as the world's greatest and dumbest hero. The Immolation Scene provided a very emotionally charged ending (despite the flaws noted below).

The  flaws in this set are directorial.  Making Loge walk backwards up a steep slope in Rheingold didn't work, as he looked so uncomfortable it was a distraction.  I thought the use of the machine as hobby horses for the Walkure's ride was silly.  I did not care for the bird's eye view of Brunnhilde's rock at the conclusion of Walkure.  The skeletal horse was OK in Siegried's trip down the Rhine, but not in the Immolation scene where it was much more visible. The dragon form of Fafner in Siegfried was truly awful. The burning of Walhalla was amazingly pathetic, given all the technology in use, consisting of heads falling off statues. As far as costumes, in Gotterdammerung Voigt dressed more like Annie Oakley than Brunnehilde.  I thought the Rhine Maiden's outfits in that opera were ridiculous.  However, while annoying at the time, in the overall scheme of things (15 hours) these are relatively minor complaints.

  I have never heard nor attended a perfect performance of any opera.  The Ring is exceptionally hard to pull off given the difficulty of the major roles, the limited number of singers in the world that can handle those parts and the scenery and special effects requirements.  This was the first attempt to use the Machine and the incredibly complicated projection system.  Therefore, I am willing to cut the Met some slack and forgive the transgressions.  All in all, a 4.75 rating, rounded up to 5 stars.  A remarkable bargain for the price.  Highly recommended.",1428537600,5,3351,4.871024734982332

6859005,3,B00BL0MGB4,"I'm a little surprised that there are so many five star reviews but then maybe I should not be as for many this will be their introduction to the Ring and as such it's not bad.  But when all the hyperbole is taken away this is a mediocre production at best.

First the good, the Met orchestra, as always is incredible and both Levine and Luisi are more than up to the task of conducting this fine ensemble.  And some of the singing here is truly great; I particularly enjoyed Kaufman and Westbroek in Walkure, Waltrud Meier's ""cameo"" in Gotterdammerung and at least here in a DVD production, Jay Hunter-Morris' Siegried.  And as always Stephanie Blythe sings Fricka incredibly well.  Hans Peter Koenig, as Fafner, Hunding, and Hagen, and Eric Owens Alberich are worthy of note.

On the other hand,I truly do not care for Voigt's (as Brunnhilde) shrieking and Brynn Terfel, who is a great actor as Woton, singing can only be characterized as ordinary.  And while Blythe can sing with the greats, she can't act at all.  They might as well put a recording with a model out there.  Someone here while commenting on the staging complained that all they did was roll her out and back in a chair in Walkure.  I don't think this is a fault of the staging; rather there is no point to doing it any  other way as she can't move herself around.  As a very large person myself, I understand and am sympathetic about the controversy behind worrying about appearance in opera but come on.

Finally for all the hooey about the machine, I find the staging just ordinary, i.e. not worthy of praise or deserving of criticism.  The machine allows one set to serve for all the myriad scenes in a very traditional way and it is creative but in the end, visually, this is not incredibly different than the extremely traditional Otto Schenk production.

In the end, this is not a bad introduction to the Ring being very straight forward and with no massive flaws (although Voigt is IMHO close) but there are better overall productions out there.  Thus three stars, i.e. merely ""average"" (although what that means in a field with only a half dozen or so entries I'm not sure.)",1406419200,6,2152,4.579634464751958

6859007,5,B00BL0MGB4,"It's hard for me to not love a Wagner opera, and the Ring Cycle was my first exposure to a complete performance, being the Solti Ring on eleven reels of tape.  I attended the previous production of ""Rheingold"" at the Met back in probably the mid 80's, when it was the new production. And that ""Ring"" I still own on Laserdisk and DVD. And if you haven't seen it, you should. Bad points, well it's a DVD with compressed audio, but it is a traditional production, which I prefer. This new production on Blu-Ray has its merits. Audio is exceptional, and the use of the Machine has gotten better as they have progressed through the cycle. The opening of Siegfried appears to be three dimensional, very well done. They coached more out of the Machine then I could have imagined.  But the Machine is at times a limiting factor, and it looks dangerous too. The old production used a stage floor of large flat rocks with different backdrops and set pieces to depict different places. Alberich's cave looked exactly like a cave. Not a suggestion of a cave, but a real cave.

 It has taken a few viewings to get to appreciate this production. But it has become my favorite because the image is sharp and clear and the audio is outstanding.",1401753600,7,1228,4.518018018018018

I felt like I was watching a production of the Ring being staged in the lumber department at Home Depot. Then moving on to the singing and acting, or what there was of it. Nobody, absolutely nobody, was up to standard in this awful production. If you want to see how Siegmund should be played, watch the dvd of Peter Hofmann. I you want to see how Sieglinde should be played, watch the dvd of Jessye Norman. If you want to see how Siegfried should be played, watch the dvd of Siegfried Jerusalem. If you want to see how Brunnhilde should be played, watch the dvds of Hildegard Behrens or Gwyneth Jones. The best production of the Ring on dvd is the Met Levine production from the 1990's. It is absolutely magnificent in every way. The current Met Machine production is RegieTrash at it's worst. It is absolutely dreadful in every way.",1396483200,9,983,4.559322033898305
6859010,3,B00BL0MGB4,"If you are a fan of the Metropolitan Opera's magnificent 1990 production of ""The Ring Cycle"" starring James Morris and Siegfried Jerusalem, then you're likely to find The Met's latest Ring Cycle to be something of a letdown. The 2010 production has some strong points but, overall, these are overshadowed by the unevenness of the entire production. Of the four operas, only Die Walkre achieves the same heights as the 1990 production. In fact, I thought Die Walkre was weakest of the four operas during that last go-around with Wagner. The 1990 staging managed to make the Met stage feel immense, matching the enormity of Wagner's story. By contrast, Robert LePage's 2010 production actually manages to make the Met's stage feel small. Things start off badly in Das Rheingold, which is a borderline disaster due to the ridiculous wirework, costuming, and make-up. Richard Croft as Loge spends most of his performance looking terrified, presumably fearing he might break his neck if a wire snaps. Bryn Terfel as Wotan looks ridiculous with hair strands of a wig covering his eye. It seems to affect Terfel's performance, as he never finds his footing as Wotan during this first opera. The staging, makeup, and costuming qualify as a complete distraction. It hardly seems worth it for one admittedly cool trick (Wotan and Loge's descent into Nibelheim).

Someone at The Met clearly got the message because Die Walkre represents a complete tweaking of the production. The result is an unquestioned triumph. Terfel suddenly seems sure of himself as Wotan. The Ride of the Valkyries, in particular, is clever and thrilling. However, all gained in Die Walkre is again lost in Seigfried (always my favorite opera in the Ring Cycle). The staging only occasionally rises above the level of a novelty act. Some of it is even laughable, like the dragon. Well, I say dragon but it's really a snake from Doctor Who circa 1983. It's that bad. Nonetheless, Seigfried is rescued by the sublime performance of Jay Hunter Morris in the title role and Terfel finally emerging from - though never really surpassing - James Morris' shadow as The Wanderer in this third opera.

While Deborah Voigt is passable as Brnnhilde in Die Walkre, it becomes obvious she represents poor casting when interacting with Hunter Morris. Hunter Morris' acting and singing has a naturalistic quality, which is very pleasing. Hunter Morris' performance is the equal of Jerusalem's in the same role during the 1990 production (though I would say Jerusalem was stronger in Seigfried and Hunter Morris was stronger in Gtterdmmerung). By contrast, Vogt's acting and singing has a forced, unnatural quality that is increasingly unpleasing. It doesn't help that Vogt looks old enough to be Hunter Morris' mother. During the last two operas, she becomes ever more histrionic and exaggerated in her acting while incorporating odder and odder phrasing in her singing. Vogt's prima donna act wears thin quickly to the point where, in Gtterdmmerung, you're left hoping for a quick conclusion to her scenes. It seems rather obvious the production would have been better served if instead Wendy Bryn Harmer (who excels in three roles; Freia in Das Rheingold, the Valkyrie Orlinde in Die Walkre, and Gutrune in Gtterdmmerung) had been cast as Brnnhilde. In any case, for two brief scenes at the beginning of Act III (Rhinemaidens Urging Seigfried to Return the Gold and The Death of Seigfried), Gtterdmmerung truly soars. It's not an accident Vogt does not appear in either scene. Gtterdmmerung is also not helped by Iain Paterson's overacting as Gunther or, at this point, the staging becoming ever more appropriate as a background for a Pink Floyd concert. However, Eric Owens as Alberich (in all four operas) and Hans-Peter Konig as Hagen are truly exceptional. It's fair to wonder if Owens might have brought more to the role of Wotan if he had been cast instead of Terfel. The re-staging of the Rhinemaidens in Gtterdmmerung is a complete success (and a reversal of the wirework fiasco in Das Rheingold). It not only works but is darn clever, too. The singing of Erin Morley, Jennifer Johnson Cano, and Tamara Mumford as the Rhinemaidens in this scene is beautiful and the highlight of the finale. Unfortunately, in both Das Rheingold and Gtterdmmerung, the Rhinemaidens remain dressed in costumes rejected from a Tim Burton film. The end result is Seigfried and Gtterdmmerung are merely all right. As you can see, there is good and bad to find in the Met's latest Ring Cycle. You take the good, you take the bad, you take the Met and there you have the new Ring Cycle.",1394236800,9,4620,4.983160621761658

She sings as if she didn't know what she sings or what happens on stage; she keeps smiling in front of the corpse of her beloved (not smile with sadness as in Gwyneth Jones) as if content with her ""wonderful"" high notes (especially, from ""So - werf ich den Brand in Walhalls prangende Burg"" -- almost comic;  and ""Ruhe, ruhe, du Gott!"" with horrible ""rrrrr,"" which IMHO should be sung softly with a bit of melancholy -- it's her own father who should be put to sleep, etc.).

6859022,5,B00BL0MGB4,"What I love about Robert Lepage's production of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen is that it demonstrates how modern stagings of the work can be creative, exciting, and wholly new while still respecting and being faithful to Wagner's vision. I've seen reviews from critics who have disparaged this particular production for not offering a unique interpretation, and I find this idea that operatic masterpieces need to be re-imagined by stage directors to be misguided. To receive the full impact of Wagner's total works of art, to be overwhelmed and transported by them, there needs to be a cohesive bond between the music, the words, and the staging. Even in the best of the productions that attempt to update or adapt the work, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-The-Ring-of-the-Nibelung-Das-Rheingold-Die-Walkre-Siegfried-Gtterdmmerung-Boulez-Chereau-Ring-Cycle/dp/B0009F2EPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: The Ring of the Nibelung ( Das Rheingold / Die Walkre / Siegfried / Gtterdmmerung) (Boulez/Chereau Ring Cycle)</a>, there is a rift between what you're hearing and what you're seeing, a disconnect between what the director is presenting and what Wagner is communicating if you will, that makes complete artistic harmony impossible. Besides, in presenting one interpretation like Chreau does, all the other subtexts and ideas in the operas that can only be fully realized in a mythological setting true to Wagner's text are given short shrift.

The Lepage production on the other hand is a sumptuous visual feast, full of imagination, truly allowing the viewer to surrender to the power of Wagner's drama. As other reviewers have pointed out, the costumes and settings are definitely in the traditional mold, but they have been given new life through an ingenious use of modern technology. Almost every scene in the opera is enhanced through the configurations and backdrops of the ""machine"", Lepage's 45-ton invention of spinning and rotating planks. This production is full of absolutely stunning sequences that will forever be burned into your memory after seeing them: Wotan and Loge's descent into Nibelheim, the ascent of the gods to Valhalla on the rainbow bridge, Siegmund running through the snow covered trees with his pursuers behind, the Valkyries riding on the planks, the reflections of Siegfried and Mime in the stream, the wood bird singing to Siegfried, the Wanderer rising up for his final evocation of Erda, Siegfried's Rhine journey and so, so much more. Then there are the little details, like bubbles rising out of the mouths of the Rhinemaidens as they sing, or leaves rustling around the feet of Siegfried as he walks that just add to the experience. The only scenes that I don't think are brought to their full potential through use of the machine are in scenes 2 and 4 of Das Rheingold. Here we are given a static, dull, grey mist-like background. While that may have worked for the action after Freia is kidnapped by the giants, I think there is a lot more that could have been done. A blue sky with clouds floating by and Valhalla projected above? Rolling hillsides or mountain peaks? The possibilities are endless. And that's the great thing about this particular production as we move into the future: it can be constantly updated, tweaked, and re-thought simply through creating new digital projections and configurations for the machine.

I know some critics have taken issue with some particular effects like the gods entering in Das Rheingold by sliding down the machine, or the disappointing dragon in Siegfried, or the ""exploding"" heads of the statues of the gods at the end Gtterdmmerung. I personally think that on the whole these reviews are being a tad bit cynical. I don't find the sliding entrances to be all that distracting to be honest. The dragon in Siegfried, while not exactly ferocious, is at least recognizable as such and a vast improvement over the dragon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Der-Ring-des-Nibelungen-Complete-Ring-Cycle-Levine-Metropolitan-Opera/dp/B00006L9ZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen - Complete Ring Cycle (Levine, Metropolitan Opera)</a>. And as for the heads of the statues exploding at the end of the cycle, I perceived it as more of a crumbling than an explosion. Of course I didn't witness it live and maybe it didn't fully come across on video. But like I mentioned earlier, in either case its something that can be tweaked. I think the overall idea of the statues of the gods falling apart to represent Valhalla burning is a good one.

The quality of the music and acting here is very high. The sound is wonderful. The orchestra is in top form. As far as the acting went, I was particularly impressed with Gerhard Siegel's portrayal of Mime and his touches of slapstick in Das Rheingold, the youthful and exciting Siegfried of Jay Hunter Morris, and Stephanie Blythe's proud and domineering Fricka, just to name a few. Eric Owens sounded great as Alberich, and I was pleasantly surprised by Deborah Voigt's singing and subtle acting touches as Brnnhilde. She proved herself to be a consummate professional. Jay Hunter Morris' sound may have been a little thin for my liking in the forging song, but his singing got better as he progressed and his acting performance saw him through. Truthfully, no one is any less than good and there are no major blemishes with any of the cast members.

6859025,1,B00BL0MGB4,"Anyone considering purchasing this Ring is advised to get the DVD recording of their older production.  The singing is much better (Voigt is quite pale compared to Behrens; she should have never agreed to take on that role.  In order to project most of the music, her voice has taken on an annoying chesty, ""chalky"" quality.) The production is near ideal, (the only clear cut failure is the representation of Fafner in Siegfried (he looks like a reject from a 1950's B horror film) and though I far prefer Luisi over Levine, the latter is in his best form and doesn't opt for his usually lugubrious tempos and excessive volumes.

(Anyone who has spent just a few minutes following a Wagner score will notice that conductors nearly ALWAYS fail to follow his numerous ""piano"" indications.  Even in ""loud"" sections, you will notice that the orchestral phrases are almost always asked to drop to the piano level just after the opening blast for the purpose of allowing the singer to be heard.  Most conductors ignore this request pretty consistantly.  Janowski is one of the few who does and he was mercilessly criticized for conducting an ""undernourished"" Ring.  Most critics and listeners simply don't know what they're talking about.)

But the key negative factor is the production.  Most of the costumes are pretty idiotic.  The Rheinmaidens look like waitresses at a gay bar and Rastafarian Alberich complete with dreds is seriously out of place.  Most everything else is accomplished with the use of projections which sometimes work admirably and other times fail miserably.

However, it's the series of two dozen gigantic seesaws that dooms this production.  When upright, the performers are constrained to move only laterally; seriously limiting the blocking and stage action.  When oriented horizontally, coming straight at you, they just look ridiculous.  Given the investment of time, money, and promotion, I suppose their stuck with this turkey for quite a while.  Perhaps they can sell the ridiculous contraption to the Cirque de Soleil, a vacuous, pointless and jumbled theatrical potpourri, where it would probably work beautifully?!?

As poor as it is, the production is not nearly as bad as the recent Bayreuth Lohengrin and Parsifal productions.  The Parsifal, complete on youtube, ranks as one of the dumbest things I've ever seen.  Nothing on the stage has anything to do with the myth or the work.  It's just complete and total crap.  At Kundry's entrance a bunch of kids pop out, gather around, knock down and beat up a hobby horse while being chastized by adults dressed like guests at Brighton Beach resort c. 1900.  Oh yes, the knights wear giant black bird wings.  In the Lohengrin, most of the chorus are dressed as mice or at least where large mouse tails.  You figure.

What infuriates me the most about these Eurotrash productions is not simply the ignorance and overall stupidity of present day stage directors who feel they have a free hand to attack any great work in any way they wish in order to suit their demented ""vision.""  It's that we finally live in an age in which the technology would allow for Wagner's original vision and stage directions to be successfully represented on stage and or film for the first time in history and THIS garbage is all we get.

In spite of listening to several rings over the years on CD (Solti, Bohm, Karajan, Krauss, Furtwangler) I have never owned a DVD (Blu-ray) set before and watched it all the way through. I've seen individual operas from Barenboim and Levine DVD's before, but neither really struck me. What tipped the scales for this one? The Machine. If you order this set, please start things off with the documentary ""Wagner's Dream"" (included) before moving on to the operas. You'll have a serious appreciation for Robert LePage's vision for the sets and overall look of the series. It's incredibly exciting to watch ""the machine"" express itself over 17 hours, in addition to seeing the lengths the Met went through to make sure the public got to see this production.

Robert Lepage is such a visionary and I think he's so brave for persevering, even when the Machine was a challenge.

6859035,5,B00BL0MGB4,"I enjoyed every segment of each disk. The extra material, including interviews and background stories are wonderful. Yes I loved the set. It's all very well described here by others. I love it that the production was carried by PBS and that many Americans had free access. Only recently I have gained a secondary access to PBS in HD via Comcast cable. My primary source is Direct TV. I will probably continue to buy every Met opera offered in Blu-ray. It is the best way to enjoy opera short of being there. Recommendation: If you want to enjoy opera on a home screen... you must have a high definition TV. The best you can get is what I suggest. That new 4k Sony 65 inch screen is what I would choose today. My sound system is quite fantastic. If you are serious about it... you must have it. I have 7.1 installed and it is great for every variety of music based programing... except talking heads. You don't want that on the big sound system. I also avoid full sound when I am viewing day to day TV entertainment. The self-contained sound of the new TVs is all I want for that... it is plenty, and also great for music. There is a wonderful world of classical music, opera and dance available here at Amazon. Classic film is another treat. I would like to see more theater productions on Blu-ray, as well as on PBS. We need more arts brought to our homes. We need a full time high definition arts channel. Right this is off topic... but I did it because I am shocked how few opera fans use HD TV or have even noticed it. DVD is truly outdated by Blu-ray. Ding dong ...dvd should be dead.

6859036,3,B00BL0MGB4,"Where to start? I saw all four of these at the cinema, dragging some classical music-inclined friends of mine each time, and each time, at least one of those friends was asleep by the second act. It's not Wagner's fault (totally)--it's the Machine. It physically prevents people from coming close to one another, so singers are, more often than not, left staring out into empty space. This kills the drama. Added to this problem is that some cast members can sing, but not act (Blythe, Kaufmann) and some can act, but not sing (Terfel, Voigt). This is a shame, because I'm a huge fan of Blythe and Terfel ordinarily, but Blythe didn't have much to work with (she got rolled on and off stage in Walkure, which is practical given the set but not very exciting) and Terfel's voice, while solid, is not a ""true"" bass voice--I found myself wishing that Alberich (Eric Owens) was singing his part instead.

Things do improve with ""Siegfried."" Jay Hunter Morris is quite a find: a kindly tenor who isn't afraid of the part and approaches it with gusto and sympathy. His voice can go thin on the high notes, but I can't name a Siegfried in the last twenty years where that isn't the case. He's an up-and-comer, as is, I think, Eva-Maria Westbroek, the Dutch soprano. ""Die Walkure"" was taped when she was ill, but her peculiar charisma and ringing high notes got my attention regardless. Unlike Voigt, she's not a shrieker, and like Morris, she seems to like her part.

All this is just to say that the casting is uneven and disappointing, as is the acting, though the latter is vastly improved over the Met's previous set from the '90s. The staging is also uneven--there are some highly effective images (sadly, the burning of Valhalla isn't a standout), but there's also a ton of upstaging kitsch. It seems like every time a character is about to reveal something important or discover something important about themselves, the stage moves. It's distracting, irritating, and LOUD. Not ideal for opera.

Other musical values (the orchestra and conductors, particularly Fabio Luisi!) are outstanding. The Met orchestra is world-class and Luisi brings a freshness to the score that is sorely missing from the Met's earlier set. He lets the music be heavy when it needs to, but the energy he pulls out of the music is very fun. If this set were released CD-only, I might recommend it based on Luisi's contribution, particularly the ""Siegfried.""

Sadly, this is probably the most solid traditional DVD production of the Ring that's available through normal channels, and it's not terribly good. It's not horrible, either, but my advice is to stick with the Boulez/Chereau set (an oldie but a goodie) or, if you must have your Wagner slow, Barenboim's Bayreuth set. This one's lackluster all around, so unless you really love one of the performers or are some kind of a completist collector, I'd say give this a pass.",1375228800,8,2904,4.790419161676646
6859037,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Finally, Wagners' epic vision can be realized, maybe for the first time, on an imaginary scale equal to the music.  Now, I know that RW himself wanted his opera produced a certain, specific (read as very, very Traditional) way.  Cosima enforced this during her reign as director for the rest of her very long life.  If you like that presentation, you got that other Met production thats as good as the traditional style will get.  IMO opera won't survive w/o something new and fresh, it really needs to be re-interpreted with each new generation.  This version is pretty spectacular.  Others have used projection technology, but this has ""The Machine.""  This has the added advantage of a 3-dimensional space that the projection can be shot on.  So, in Seigfried, you have a beautiful forest scene that the actors can walk across, while the computer technology rustles the leaves underfoot.  Then the Machine can change postion to a wholly vertical screen if necessary.  Then, take a look at the amazing journey to Nibelheim, the Machine is twisted as Wotan and Loge ""walk"" on suspened wires across to the depths of the netherworld.  The climax to Das Rheingold is... wow.  As the Gods ascend up the Rainbow Bridge (here a beautiful glimmering computer generated and projected rainbow), the Machine then tilts down on both sides until it is completely vertical, and a full Starfield is seen.  Wow.  This reminded me of that scene in Immortal Beloved.  Oh, the opening with the undulating wave effect and the Rhinemaidens suspended in midair, bubbles coming out of their mouths while they sing.  The technology is finally here, and vision has equalled vision.  So many great moments (and many ""dull 1/4 hours"").  One final note, a slightly negative one, and this is regarding the actual libretto.  Dare I criticize Wagner himself?  Why not... the Ring is way, way, much too repetitive in it's storytelling.  You hear the same freaking subplots told about 20 times over and over and over by seemingly every possible character.  It got on my nerves about the 15th time I heard how Wotan could not steal the ring himself so he had to have Seigfried do it for him.  I mean, I've heard this already.  Once, maybe twice... but 20?  I don't need that.  And this true of every single subplot.  7 times you hear how Seigfried had no fear and killed the dragon and through the blood can understand birds.  I don't need to hear this told 7 times.  Ok, Ive beaten this point enough... Lol.

6859040,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Wagner's Ring Cycle was designed as an audio-visual feast and this new Met production brings all elements together in a way that is both marvelously new and fully faithful to his intention. You get the unadulterated storyline, without the slightest hint of irony or reinterpretation, and yet it is bravely futuristic in its use of stage technology. There were apparently problems with ""the machine"", the mechanical stage, in live performances, but it works to perfect effect on the video version. The CGI and its ability to interact with human movement - they achieve the impossible here: a man washing the blood off his hands turning the whole river into a torrent of blood, mermaids swimming in a river, gods calling up a rainbow bridge and the ascending on it to their castle in the sky, a fearful flight through a forest, a person on a rock surrounded by molten lava, etc etc. I salute the creators of this masterpiece and give this disk my highest recommendation. I found it so overwhelmingly wonderful that I watched the first disk, Das Rheingold, four times, before starting on the second.
These operas are legendarily difficult to sing; at any one time there is only a handful of singers capable of fully realizing Wotan, Brunhilde and Siegfried, each of which has to be on stage for nearly four hours singing a highly complex and subtle musical line over an enormous orchestra. The principles manage it surprisingly well here, given that they are also good actors. And there is an interesting story in the extras for Siegfried, how Jay Hunter Morris was parachuted into the role at literally the last moment; you'd never know - especially in Gotterdammerung, where he gets all the beauty of Wagner's lines.
This collection is a visual feast as well as musical and one of the many things to praise is how the opera singers are so suited visually to their roles. the Gods really look like gods, the Germans like Ancient Germans, the Giants like giants. It is probably unfair to single out anyone in this exceptional cast but I do have a few favorites. Stephanie Blythe's Fricka is, I think, the best of the gods, she just simply looks and sounds larger than life. Jonas Kaufmann is a superb hero. Everybody praises Eric Owens for his wonderful Alberich. I particularly love the mermaids, they are so playful, silly and coquettish. But the visual star of the lot and a huge driving force of vocal and visual energy is Deborah Voigh as the indomitable Brunhilde. She is so perfect in the role that it is scarcely believable this is her first time.
I love the cinematography: the intimacy of the performances is never lost in the vast stage. And the orchestra is simply glorious. The transcendent beauty of the final sequence in Rheingold is fully realized here. I was transfixed.",1371945600,2,2784,4.79002079002079

Commentary on performers jumps between Jerusalem and Morris, etc. etc. Reviewers appear to  reference 2010, 20 years ago, and 2012... I'm just sayin'...",1366416000,5,398,5.21875
6859046,4,B00BL0MGB4,"This is partly a review of the DVD and partly a review of Amazon's presentation of it.  It seems at first that this listing is for the DVD of the current (2010+) Met production, conducted by Levine and Luisi, but Amazon starts it off with a long description of the Bertrand de Billy production in Barcelona.  I read a lot of the customer reviews.  Some are reviews of the current Met production, others review the Barcelona production, or one conducted by Barenboim, still others seem to review the earlier Met production from the 90's, and some are so vague and general it is impossible to tell which production is referenced.  As if the Ring were not demanding and complicated enough on its own, these layers of confusion would make it impossible to make any rational choice as to purchasing this item, whatever it may be.

I would also like to say a thing or two about the actual current Met production which (I think) may be preserved in this set.  My familiarity with it is from attendance at all four operas as presented in the Live in HD transmissions.  To me the outstanding feature of this Ring is the appearance of American singers in so many of the important roles.  It is probably the closest we have come to an American Ring.  All the American singers are wonderful, which is not to say that the Europeans are not great as well; there are just fewer of them than usual. Particularly outstanding among the Americans, in my opinion, were Eric Owens, whose Alberich could well be, vocally and dramatically, the best ever, and Jay Hunter Morris, whose bright, youthful, enthusiastic, and truly fearless singing as Siegfried brings the character to life in a way that is very appealing and also unique to his own particular personality and musical talents.

As to the production itself, it has its moments, but overall the planks remain awkward, clunky, meaningless, distracting, and not, in my opinion, worth all the trouble and expense.  Over the course of the four operas things improved somewhat, as the planks were more and more kept still and out of the way of the singers, moving usually only during transitions and serving mainly as a screen for the excellent projections.  Watching the backstage videos of scene changes included in the transmissions, my impression was that the plank arrangement became less of a machine and more of a lifting project for stagehands as time went on.  During the first two operas it was sometimes very stressful to watch the singers trying to balance, hop, and slide on the planks as they also tried to sing, sometimes while the planks moved under them.  What was lost, for the most part, was any interaction among the people on the stage, as they struggled to remain upright and often found themselves isolated from each other on little plateaus or peninsulas or in little caves. The last two operas were much more effective, but only because the ""machine"" had been somewhat tamed and made less intrusive, with more reliance on the projections for story-telling.

I see that there is still no complete CD version available.  Having seen the transmissions, I am waiting for a complete audio version as my souvenir of this production.  Listening to the current 2013 radio broadcasts, I would be very happy to have a recording of this season's version, with the singers probably more relaxed and more focused on singing instead of on not falling or being crushed. I have especially enjoyed another American singer, Mark Delavan, as this year's Wotan, and feel that his performance deserves to be preserved.",1366416000,,3553,4.817434210526316

6859055,5,B00BL0MGB4,"As a lad of seventeen, during an all-nighter with Heineken-tippling buddies, I found myself with a liminal mindset in which a Loge might substitute for a Jumping Jack Flash, prompting the gathering to explore the vast Wagner collection of our host's father. Of course, we thought it might be cool to hear the Ride of the Walkyries. Easier said than done. We searched in a huge Walkyrie boxed set of vinyl LPs. Side after side, seemingly dozens, and we could not find it, never imagining such excitement could be set in the third act. In the meantime, we were treated to a new kind of music that occupied time, but that seemed to have no forward momentum. At the end of the evening, we realized Wagner must be an acquired, more adult taste, though one well worth acquiring. Years later, after someone dared to film the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, comes a spectacular Blu-ray set of the first great staged Ring that makes the incredible story seem to fly by. It might actually be a ring that Wagner himself might have admired. Or, at least considered a first step toward the ultimate realization of his spellbinding, practically unstageable vision. That, by the way, still has yet to happen, although this production offers a tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. In many ways, this is the best set available for believable character, motivation, vocals, ensemble acting and emotional arc, from the opening E flat major chord held for 134 bars, accompanied by the suggestion of waves on the river Rhein, until the Rheingold is returned to the aquatic maidens in charge of its safekeeping. The challenge has always been the many hours of music and the relatively limited action. The visual feast of this set makes that problem far less obvious. Actually, even in a less engaging production one can appreciate Wagner's sense of pacing. He had already done a lot to improve the flow and dramatic impact of his source material. To see what I mean, you should read the Nibelungenlied, the German source, the Volsungesage, an Icelandic source and Njal's Saga, another Icelandic source for Wotan's legal paranoia (embodied by all those runes on his spear). The Althing law council of Njal's Saga explains Wotan's fear of breaking any treaty or his word of honor. There has never been a problem with the ravishing music, but, rather, the creative limitations of the stagecraft. A few of the countless cinematic treasures of this production are the gorgeous projections (which have apparently already evolved and will continue to do so during the years the production is in use at the Met). They include waterfalls, Stygian hell worms, metaphysical fires, all-seeing eyes, Rhinemaidens treading water on white water rapids, Wotan's ominous ravens, Siegfried's seemingly tropical talking bird friend. The opera Rhinegold has the most exhilarating musical finale of any opera; and that music is now given a stunning visual equivalent. Wotan's mountain of fire is breathtaking. The world Ash Tree with the fateful weavings of the Norns is magisterial. The house of Hunding, the Gibichung hall...all wonderful. These exciting elements underscore the potential of a fully produced cinematic version of the opera, even as it reveals the dramatic issues that still exist. The many longeurs into which the action lapses will take an ingenious screenplay, not just a beautiful mis-en-scene. One can imagine the camera getting into the heads of the characters and seeing what they see or remember, for example. But, at close to 16 hours, the screenplay alone could be a project ten years in the making. In the meantime, this set enhances the wonder of the work, for which it is indispensable.
As for the singing. There is none better. Of course, no one ever heard Wagner's preferred Siegfried, Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld, as he died two weeks after starring in Tristan und Isolde, just before the birth of recorded sound. In fact, even Wagner never actually heard him as Siegfried, but imagined that he would be the ultimate heldentenor. In any case, no one will top Lauritz Melchior any time soon, but Jay Hunter Morris certainly has the right look and a solid, sweet sound. He actually makes you love the character and feel shock and remorse at his loss. The Rhinemaidens and Walkyries are fabulous, proving that there really is no minor role in Wagner, no matter how short. For the first time ever, you will understand the powerful musicality of the role of Wotan, thanks to the handsome voice and splendid acting of Bryn Tervel. Deborah Voigt delivers the most beautiful performance of Brunhilde, the first in recent recorded history totally on pitch. Her work is up there with the best of Flagstad. Unlike any other, however, she owns the role dramatically. Let's not forget, her character must convince as a teenage girl, then as a woman in love, then as an avenging angel in a world out of balance. Voigt makes each phase of her journey believable. The sound is by turns pretty and heroic. It's an amazing achievement. Wagner left no comments about his first Brunhilde, Amalie Materna, and perhaps his ideal Walkyrie was over a century away. In any case, many other great singers participate here with excellence. Jonas Kaufmann and Eva Maria Westbroek are glorious as the amorous twins. Here in Blu-ray their interaction is just gorgeous and their singing, ravishing. Hans-Peter Koenig all but steals the show with his gigantic, booming bass. He's like such great artists of the past as Hans Hermann Nissen, thought to be extinct. Loge is rendered a total delight by Richard Croft who is asked to walk backward up as steep incline on a cloud of flame. He does this while producing beautiful sound. And his brother, Dwayne, puts a dent in the universe with Donner's hammer and his sterling baritone. Stephanie Blythe has given the performance of a lifetime as Fricka, whose desire for love is every bit as important as Alberich's in setting the wheels of our fateful tale in motion.
Anyone interested in great music and great movies must own this set. It is to be hoped that some ambitious director will buy it, too, and realize what a great epic film it would make.",1361664000,4,6168,4.9033492822966505

I own 4 complete cycles on DVD, and 2 other audio recordings as well as other media exposure including a few Wagner bios, many of his writings, etc. And all comparison and academic-izing (which I love so dearly) aside - I loved this Ring. Face value this Ring was fun, pure and simple. Putting the academic-izing and comparisons back into the equation this Ring is good, it hits all the important nails well enough, and gives some wonderful acting and pretty good singing, but it's not by any means the best. That being said I believe that Wagner's Ring is a work we are blessed enough to have the ability to view over and over again in many different ways and each time pull something new out of. And in that light this is, hands down the best introduction to the Ring cycle out there. The characters are laid out simply, motives are clear, the action follows well from scene to scene, there's not much set to get wrapped up in and for the most part its sung pretty well. After experiencing this ring I believe viewers will be much better prepared to get into other Rings as well which show more complex character development/intriguing story telling and really awesome musicianship. Not that viewers are dumb, it's just that the ring is big, and very very complex, this show cleared a few things up for me as I watched it.

I'm going to be a bit brisk with the singing because I do not think it is hugely remarkable. If you are looking for a recording of amazing singing you have to look back 30-40 (or more years), with rare exceptions (not numerable enough to fill out a cast) we just don't make Wagnarian singers any more. Acting wise though I felt that many of people were in some cases better suited to the rolls than those of the previous generation and give some very transparent and exciting acting performances.  Musically the singers are world class (though that phrase doesn't carry the weight it used to) no doubt, though many of them do feel ill suited in places to the rolls. Deborah Voigt gives a stirring acting Brunhilde though her voice is a bit past it's prime she plays it well. Bryn Terfel has a light voice, I've often felt too light for Wagner, and it's true here as well. Often in the theater I could not even hear him, however that is not a problem on the DVDs, and the lighter voice he takes to Wotan gives him a remarkable edge that you have to go back 60-70 years to hear again and that I found very exciting. Jay Hunter Morris was an excellent Siegfried and I would make similar comments about him as I did of Bryn. Stephanie Blyth is absolutely incredible - rousing and remarkable, as well as Hans Peter Konig and Eric Owens. One of my favorite characters in the Ring is Hagen and HPK really does him justice.

The set took a lot of flack when it came out, people said it was stupid and complained bitterly about the noise it made, a problem in the theater though not on the DVDs. Personally I found it underwhelming, though not particularly gripe worthy. The set has some absolutely amazing visual moments but time wise 95% of it it sits there as a very expensive and dull backdrop. The direction is simple, in some cases overly simple, but as I stated before, that's in some ways what I liked about this production - it gives a very easy introduction to what is a very very complicated story - as any story which takes 15 hours to tell must inherently be. I do take offense at the gaul that LePage and Gelb had standing by this production claiming it to be a huge bold step forward and simply discounting dissenters as ignorant to art apparently def to the actual complaints people had. To set my pen to this informal record book: there is nothing new here save for the mechanics of the set itself, the minimalist sets were done every year from as far back as the 1920s until the late 50s, the postmodern things has been done before and the characters are just too simple to be regarded as ground breaking in any way, they just don't embody enough of anything to push any boundaries.

Of true note, and this I must say, is the absolutely amazing conducting by James Levine. He has been conducting Wagner for many (40?) years now and he has one of the most well honed and oiled orchestras at his finger tips and he the sounds the produce are nothing short of miraculous. This recording is a starker and more stripped down musically and flourish wise than his previous recordings (thinking of the 90s DVD) and it's amazing, it shows the master at his peak, when he has looked back on a lifetime of art has taken out everything superfluous from his previous art and distilled it down to everything essential and done that perfectly. I was absolutely transfixed both in the theater and at the simulcasts at his miraculous creation. The Japanese call the aura around such things ""sabi"" and this has it in spades. Aguste Rodin commented similarly of the end of life work of Rembrant and he himself echoed such ideals in his final masterpiece: the portrait of Balzac.

So maybe this deserves 4 stars, maybe I'm being too hard on this production. I'll stick with three simply because in the grand scheme of things I find this production average, and I hope the viewer goes out and watches more - finds one that deserves 5 stars (I know which one that is for me, but it's different for everyone), but stop here first. I know it's an expensive DVD set, and they all are, but you have a lifetime to enjoy the Ring and in the end 100$ a year isn't very much. Enjoy this one for a while and after you've sat with it for a while find a new one. And if you're only going to watch one ring, and you're not a particularly experienced opera goer, this is the one for you.",1360800000,32,5902,4.425022999080037
6859058,5,B00BL0MGB4,"When I worked in a professional theatre in England we performed in a series of Euripides plays.  One critic gave us a terrible review and said the play was flawed in its story telling, immediately afterwards our artistic director wrote to the critic and pointed out that he was wrong.  The critic replied and admitted that he had looked up the wrong play in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  However, the damage was soon done.

I can understand that a critic, who is asked to critique an operas or play, must get bored by seeing the same old stuff.  The present live recording of the Met's Ring Cycle surpasses the old genre and takes us to a new level of production.  Terfel contends that the set is too important, but for Wagner the set was just as important as the singing.

La Page's Ring is truly magical, powerful and transcends present standards.  I am sure it is the way of the future.  Yes, there are failings for example in Siegfried the bird resting on his arm does not work, but so what, this Cycle has a few faults, yet it is the closest production we have come to what the composer wanted; The critics are wrong -this trilogy has set a new standard.

On CD there has never been a version to surpass the 1960's recording on London conducted by Solti, but one has to remember that his recording was made in a recording studio and if  something went wrong it could be redone.  In my view the present Met's Ring is superb as a live HD performance.  One has to recognise that it is LIVE and in live productions you will hear stage noise, the singers may lack in some areas.  Terfel unfortunately does not have the majesty in his voice that is needed for Wotan, Voight may lack some of the high notes, but how can you not get caught up in Morris's raw energy as Siegfried, and wonder at sheer beauty of Jonas Kauffmann's voice.

 One has to accept that as a live performance this is a remarkable achievement and it is by far the most outstanding production on video.  Forget the critics this production is pure electrical  magic.",1360713600,6,2034,4.451351351351351

6859061,5,B00BL0MGB4,"I've not read any of the other 62 reviews of this DVD set.  While Amazon may like a ""discussion,""  I don't.  What is the point of reviewing a review?  To prove that everybody has an opinion?

What's NOT to like about the LePage ""Ring?""  Well...it's hard to find, these days, cameramen for TV or movies who don't think extreme close-ups are exciting.  I don't.  When a character's face fills the whole screen, something is very wrong.  Many of the singers in this ""Ring"" perspire heavily and there is no need whatever the see rivers of sweat coming down faces.

I've seen worse costumes in other ""Rings.""  The costumes here are pretty bad.  Amazingly wonderful, though, is Erda's ""Siegfried"" black glass costume.

Gerhard Siegel's Mime is by far the worst of the characterizations we see.  Though his singing is fine, he thinks of himself, surely, as the Jim Carrey of opera - full of comic antics which Siegel thinks make his character more interesting - like sticking carrots in his ears.  What Siegel has done is present characterization distractions which hurt Wagner.

For me, the best acting and voice comes from Eric Owens as Alberich...particularly in ""Rheingold.""  Owens is the best Alberich I've ever seen...and I've seen 18.  In my view, his is a perfect performance.

Particularly fine is Jay Hunter Morris, who, though he looks, with that beard and mustache, like a good ol' Texas country boy, manages to act so convincingly in such an expansive way, one manages to forget the ""machine"" for a time.  (It has been said that at the end of ""Walkuere,"" Wotan nags Bruenhilde into a coma.  At the end of ""Siegfried,"" Siegfried nags Bruenhilde into an orgasm.  And this is accomplished in spite of the ""machine.""  Perhaps Don Ottavio would have been more persuasive with Donna Anna had he had a ""machine."")  Aside from the enormous expense and techical difficulties associated with the ""machine,"" the director has a problem avoiding using it for increasingly spectacular effects as the ""Ring"" progresses.  It's bad enough to see the Rhinemaidens transported from the Rhine to Niagara Falls.  But when Gunther washes Siegfried's blood from his hands in the Rhine, it changes the whole river red.  The walls of Gibich Hall are an explosion of color.  Why?  It is one thing to use such a ""machine"" planks to represent trees, but the director has gone overboard with ""clever"" plank effects.  ""Plank effects"" are obviously divided into two parts: using the individual planks to represent various natural or architectural structures,  and using the planks as a projection screen.  Certainly, there have been better projected sets in other ""Rings.""  The Valencia ""Ring,"" was doing better projections, but to enhance the music rather than to distract from the story, with better-looking Siegfrieds (i.e. Lance Ryan) when ""The Ring"" was just a gleam in Robert LePage's eye.

The ""machine"" in this production is simply too expensive, too dangerous (See Siegfried fall into the fire around Bruenhide's rock.), and too distracting for a show which requires intense concentration.  Do we really need to see a forest bird sitting on Siegfried's lap?  (Is the MET doing anything at all to reduce ticket prices so that ordinaly people can enjoy live opera?)

I am torn about Jonas Kaufmann (as Siegmund).  He is so amazingly beautiful, sexy, and fresh, I found myself wondering why he was so completely dressed.  So, is having physical perfection on stage a ""distraction"" or a necessary part of the story which our usual old, fat ""Ring"" characters cannot approach?

In the end, I feel guilty for liking this ""Ring"" as much as I did.  It really WAS spectacular!!!

P.S.  Bringing a Tarnhelm to a hunt is like bringing a toaster to a grocery store.  If Siegfried longs for Bruenhilde as he is dying, why not simply use the Helm to get him there?  Better, leave the Helm at home!  Also, why go to the trouble of creating a spear for Wotan that is built like a window shade, with a long roll of rune-laden parchment rolled around a thin metal rod?  This strange construction serves no purpose.",1360022400,2,4079,4.8790087463556855

6859063,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Much has been written about this production of the Ring at the MET. Reviews of the performances abound and are all over the spectrum.  What makes this a must is the innovation in terms of the production. Even if you don't like ""the machine"" there is no doubt that it is an important step in the evolution of what we call a life production.  We have seen many productions where the plot is transformed and transposed in time. Supposedly, the intention is to bring it closer to our present days and reality.  This production leaves it as Wagner wrote it, but brings new technologies to make it closer to what we are by now accustomed to see in movies, while being a life production. How this production will be remembered and its impact on further productions only time will tell. That's why should have it.  This set of Blu-Ray discs includes ""Wagner's dream"", a movie about the machine, or better, about what the producer wanted to create with it. It is a movie more about the people than the engineering of the machine, but it is interesting in the context of bringing new technology into the stage, a quite heavy one this time.

6859071,5,B00BL0MGB4,I am very fond of Wagner--I even went to Bayreuth for 2 weeks. If you are fond of Wagner you can't do better than seeing the Ring as produced by the Met.,1353888000,2,153,3.8125
6859072,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Wagner wanted to cast a spell with the Ring, to create a hypnotic dream world where words, mythology, music and visuals worked together to create a magical shared experience for the audience. To achieve this he built his own theater where he went so far as to hide the orchestra under the stage in order enhance the magical spell.  Nineteenth century stage technology was certainly not capable of achieving his ideal visual production, but he made up for that with an orchestra that conjures up water, fire, love, emotion, passion and a whole visual sound world that no other artistic medium can match.

The new Met Ring was promoted as the first production that would bring stage technology to match Wagner's music.  I therefore bought a ticket to Die Walkure with great anticipation during its premiere season.  I was deeply disappointed.  Though there were some great visuals, they were all at the expense of a creaking, groaning, crackling machine that completely broke the magical spell that Wagner was trying to cast.  Every time the set would move, you would be pulled out of your trance by this loud, straining behemoth of a machine that called attention to itself rather than the drama.  I decided then and there that I would not bother to see the rest of the cycle at the theater.

I did purchase the Blu-Ray of the entire cycle, however, and am glad that I did.  Gone is the distracting noise of the machine.  Now you can focus on the music, drama, performances and production.  It is very, very good.  Definitely my favorite Ring on video.  In my opinion, the experience of watching this video with a good HDTV and sound system far surpasses the experience in the theater and, at about one tenth of the cost of a Ring Cycle ticket, is an absolute bargain.",1353888000,10,1767,4.6980519480519485
6859073,5,B00BL0MGB4,"The great German composer Richard Wagner took various Teutonic and Icelandic legends and composed the books, libretti and the music for four towering musical dramas, which he called The Ring of the Nibelungen Cycle. I do not doubt that Wagner heard in his superb musical mind, what the various orchestral and vocal notes, which he wrote, were to sounds like. I am also sure that he could visualize how all this would look on stage. Wagner had a concept in his mind throughout this long process spread over many years, which took to bring forth the Ring cycle. Wagner's score, which contained all the musical, orchestral and vocal parts, however, made no sound. It took over the years of many excellent conductors, instrumentalists and singers to bring Wagner's musical blueprints to life. Each of these musicians also had a concept of what the notes and roles encompassed about. Some performers were obviously much more successful than others in realizing the demands which Wagner had provided.
Many singers over the years have essayed the parts which make up the Ring cycle. There have been many notable performances and unfortunately also a few forget the old ones as well. The latest Metropolitan series involves two notable maestros (James Levine and Fabio Luisi), the wonderful Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and some of the finest singers in the world today. Levine and Luisi each bring their individual concepts to the score but both re-create the Wagner scores very well. While the onstage vocal performers in this series are going to be compared to some of the outstanding performance concepts of the past, often which of the various performers which we prefer to listen to is dependent on our individual concepts of how to perform and execute each role. All of the singers in the new Met Ring cycle are first rate, and even at the top of this genre in the world today. This is often one of the most lyrically sung Ring Cycles which I have ever heard. Deborah Voigt, Bryn Terfel, Jay Hunter Morris, Jonas Kaufmann, Stephanie Blythe, Eva-Marie Westbroek, Gerhard Siegel, Eric Owens and  Hans-Peter Koenig as well as others in the cast are simply fantastic.
The stage image which Wagner envisioned was certainly not possible to achieve during his lifetime. I don't believe he ever saw his concept realized fully during his lifetime. The actual ""staging"" of an opera production is often far more controversial than singer A or B, or conductor A or B. One. Either accepts and appreciates the directors concept or does not. Such acceptance or rejection is usually either very strongly for or very strongly against. No production gathers 100% approval or 100% rejection. This is undoubtedly going to be true for Robert Lepage's production as well. I personally find this to be one of the finest and most exciting productions of the Ring Cycle which I have been privileged to see. The ""machine"" allows a more or less uni-set concept which I feel works very well. The theatrical effects such as achieved in the various lighting, costumes and other creations inherent in the ring, make this a thrilling, modern, but still holding to the traditions of Wagner Ring cycle. I would heartily recommend this eight DVD set to any who would like to experience the Ring cycle in a production which may prove to be the most ""state of the art"" production available at this time. I cannot imagine the effects the machine provides being overshadowed currently by any means but cinema graphic.

With members of its faithful well-heeled customer base trumpeting they have seen 35 Rings ""and want no changes"", management would defy its paymasters at their peril and thank God for that. We have two modern Blu-ray Rings already and we do not need another just now.
The casting is outstanding. Deborah Voigt is brilliant in her first Brnnhilde, and a vast improvement over Jennifer Wilson in the Spanish space age Ring. Hans-Peter Knig looked a bit as if the rats had been at him as Hunding but was magnificent as Hagen. All the lesser members were exceptionally well cast, even Stephanie Blythe, whose many assets I thought might overwhelm her. Not a bit of it, she was well suited to Fricka who she played imperiously. Eric Owens as Alberich was another find. ""I don't want to be just a black Alberich but chosen for my acting and musical skills"". Well he deserved his part on great merit. Bryn Terfel's stocky Welsh frame is no match for Uusitalo, the giant Finn from the Arctic tunturi but what he lacks in size he makes up with good acting.
As usual the Met colour is drab and dark and it must be very frustrating being one of their cameramen. Focus is soft and the overlayed light patterns on the machine play havoc with actor definition. This is not a very good overall picture but it is far better than the old Met SD, it could just have been a lot better. The sound is generally good but it did not remind me of Solti! Now and again, (one example was in the Norn's scene), I detected some muddle in the sound. Let us see what others detect.

Then I saw this production of the DER RING DES NIGELUNGEN in HD, and my eyes and ears were opened to the blend of theatre and music that Wagner himself had sought. I saw no wing-and-drop painted scenery, no overweight singers standing still and watching the conductor's baton. I saw (thanks to Robert LePage) the Rhine River, mountain tops, walls of fire, forests, mines and forges, huts and bridges to Valhalla, all inhabited by gods, giants, mermaids, monsters and heroic warriors. I heard the Metropolitan Opera orchestra (conducted by James Levine and Fabio Luisi) tickle my ears with birdsong, caress them with love duets, and blast them with battles. Finally Wagner's music embodied by stagecraft!

I am particularly intrigued by the fifth disc, WAGNER'S DREAM, which shows how LePage developed the machinery for the setting and how his actor-singers learned to fly and walk on huge moving set pieces--all the while creating characters and making sublime music.

6859091,4,B00BL0MGB4,"Say what you want - no one can deny that this production took big chances and did things that have never before been seen on an opera stage. There are many moments that are extraordinary (the Rhinemaidens, the descent into Nibelheim, the opening of Walkure, the forest scenes in Siegfried), and a few that make you want to tear your hair out (gods entering on slides, the muppet dragon in Siegfried). I was at the Met with my son for opening night of Die Walkure and I want to tell you - at the opening of Act I, when the machine transformed itself into a forest and the snow was falling, it was magical. Some of that you can see from the HD broadcasts, but not the full effect. On the other hand we also got to witness Deborah Voigt fall off the set on the first entrance of her life as Brunnhilde. But she and Bryn Terfel are pros - they didn't miss a beat and improvised with what they had.

The blu-ray recording is extraordinarily good. The sound is excellent and the visuals exciting. Somehow they managed to eliminate the machine creaking that was a feature of the live performances, although less so in the HD broadcasts. My only (minor) gripe is that while closeups create an experience you will not have in the theater (unless you are paying more for you seat than I am), I would have liked to have seen a little more utilization of a wider perspective.

The singing in this production is excellent, as is the orchestral performance (although as others have noted Luisi's conducting of the immolation scene seems emotionally flat). I thought Voigt was very good - she got better as the cycle developed. Eric Owens and Stephanie Blythe are deserving of all the acclaim they received in their roles. Jay Hunter Morris was great as Siegfried and had a great back story. And Hans-Peter Koenig is terrific - singing in all four operas as Fafner/Hunding/Hagen. The rest of the cast is very good - no weak links.

This production will be talked about for a long time and will set a new standard for imaginative production. My guess is that some of the more lame-brained moments will be fixed in subsequent performances.

The inclusion of Wagner's Dream is a real bonus. A fascinating documentary - my wife even liked it and she hates opera.

6859094,4,B00BL0MGB4,"This new Ring Cycle at the MET is a very good production. The stage set is made for the 21st century - great job! Maestro Luisi conducted very well. Unfortunately, Maestro Levine, due to his illness, couldn't continue. Best wishes for his recovery. The orchestra as good as all the time. Consider on what short notice Jay Hunter Morris had to jump in to play the main character role as Siegfried, he did an excellent job! He is not a Siegfried Jerusalem, who was brilliant in the Ring Cycle of the 90s directed by Otto Schenck, but such a brilliant voice is very rare and Mr. Morris did his job very well and he will grow into this part. Deborah Voigt in her debut as Bruennhilde sang very good, but one would wish a better acting performance on stage. The highlight of this cycle is definitely Bryn Terfel as Wotan/Wanderer and Jonas Kaufmann as Siegmund. Bryn Terfel probably close to the best performance I have heard someone sang this role. Only John Tomlinson was slightly better, but Mr. Terfel is great on stage and brilliant in his voice. Bravo Jonas Kaufmann, what a great performance as Siegmund. His voice is a God-given gift. Wonderful! Other very goog singers were Hans-Peter Koenig as Fafner/Hunding/Hagen. The best Hagen I have ever heard! Also, Eric Owens was a brilliant Alberich. Superb!

As to the conductors, both Levine and Luisi are wonderful.  It is clear that their concepts of Wagner are different but it is important to realize that both are valid.",1348704000,3,535,4.453608247422681
6859097,5,B00BL0MGB4,"I saw Die Walkure in the house, when they were filming the HD production, and the other 3 operas at my local movie theater in HD.  All were fantastic experiences, but having them home to watch over and over again is even better.  And just think, $119.99.  To compare, I bought the laserdisc  version of the Schenk Ring Cycle in 1994, at a cost of $335.00.  And I've enjoyed it many times.  And when I saw Die Walkure live, my ticket was around $300.00.  For just the one opera.  In the house, of course, you get better sound.  In the movie theater, you get great picture, but the sound of the orchestra is not always so full and rich.  But at home, on a widescreen HD television, with a surround sound system, you get great picture, with closeups, and amazing sound quality.

The bluray has DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and PCM Stereo.  Compared with my laserdisc version of the Schenk production, the sound here is much richer, much more enveloping, for both orchestra and singers.  The picture is 1080i HD, 16:9, which fills my 59 inch screen, and looks beautiful (the Schenk is SD, soft picture, 1.33:1, with black bars on the sides on my TV).  There are subtitles, which you can turn on or off, in English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese.  As others have pointed out the set includes four blurays, one for each opera, along with a fifth bluray of the film Wagner's Dream.  I watched this first, and it really explains the challenges of the production well.  Each opera disc contains a short booklet, listing the chapter stops and timings, an essay and the synopsis.  The discs themselves have some special features.  When I saw the broadcasts in the theaters, there were live cast interviews between the acts.  But by including these as special features, you can watch the opera uninterrupted, and then view the interviews later.  The Walkure disc has a short special on leitmotifs, with members of the horn section illustrating the themes, in closeup and stunning sound.

You've read all the pros and cons of the production. I for one, thought it was just right, a balance between traditionalist productions and crazy modern ones.  I loved the costumes, which are traditional, especially the Walkyries' costumes, which I thought were very flattering to the various builds of the nine ladies.  I thought the ring of fire scene in the Schenk production (which I also saw live) was more magical, but in general, the myriad imaginative uses of the machine were both technically impressive and wonderfully illustrative of the story.

As for the singing, unless one goes back and compares it to something like the Solti Ring, which was recorded over many years, with numerous outtakes, not in front of a live audience like this, it was magnificent.  In Rheingold, the cast is top notch throughout, from a lovely trio sound of the Rheinmaidens, to Eric Owens as a powerful Alberich, ably showing the frustration and later arrogance of the character, to Stephanie Blythe as Fricka, and Bryn Terfel as Wotan, his deep, lush, Wagnerian baritone showing why he is king of the Gods.  I also liked Adam Diegel in the small role of Froh, his clarion tenor showing promise for the future.  Wendy Bryn Harmer plays a fetching Freia in Rheingold.  She later is one of the Walkyries, and then Gutrune in Gotterdammerung.

In Die Walkure, Terfel really gets to show his credentials, both as a singer and an actor, and his performance is gripping.  Deborah Voigt, whom I have seen many times, is one of the finest filmed Brunhildes ever (not comparing to CD versions).  I agree with some that her voice is just a tad less amazing than it was in her 1993 Elektra broadcast, but she still has power to spare, a deep, rich sound, and excellent control throughout her range.  She also acts the part wonderfully.  I can imagine Birgit Nilsson, who of course had the greatest voice of all time for this role, costumed like this, with ultra closeups.  Well, maybe I shouldn't imagine that.  Eva-Maria Westbroek is an excellent Sieglinde, able to hit the highest notes without any strain, a large voice.  And then there is Jonas Kaufmann as Siegmund.  Wow.  What a voice.  He really makes this opera special.

Now I've watched Siegfried.  I love this opera, as it has tons of comedy, and a dramatic happy ending, things not always present in opera.  I am even more convinced than before that the Lepage production is a winner.  There are beautiful visual effects, such as a video ""pond"" with reflections of the live characters, a 3-D forest bird whose beak actually is triggered to the voice of the singer, and a stunning representation of the fiery top of the mountain where Siegfried wakes Brunnhilde.  I went back and looked at my dvd of the Chereau production in 1976 and the Met Otto Schenk production.  Compared to this new one, they both looked static, boring.  Costumes are also better, especially Erda, who comes from the Earth, and has a dress covered with what looks like pieces of shiny volcanic rock.  You really have to see it, and it matches her character.  As for singing, once again, it's excellent.  Terfel as the Wanderer is commanding, but now world weary.  Gerhard Siegel as Mime is excellent, a very strong voice (he used to sing Siegfrieds).  Jay Hunter Morris, the last minute replacement, has a fine voice, smooth and powerful.  I'm not sure he matches every Siegfried of the past, but he really looks heroic, and acts perfectly, starting as a naive foolish wild child, but gradually learning about love, women and destiny.  But Deborah Voigt, for me, is the star.  Her 35 minute love duet showcases a huge, full sound, torrents of notes flowing effortlessly over the orchestra to fill the hall.  Her acting is also spot on, and the chemistry between Brunnhilde and Siegfried is palpable.  This is one wonderful disc, which I'll watch over and over again.

One singer I haven't mentioned yet is Hans-Peter Konig, who plays Fafner, Hunding and Hagen over the course of the cycle.  He has a thunderous deep bass, used to great effect in these villain roles.  Wendy Bryn Harmer, who was Freia and then one of the Valkyries, plays Gutrune in Gotterdammerung.  She looks and sounds beautiful, and acts her part well.  One of the best things about this 4th opera in the cycle is that it has a chorus.  And what a sound they make!  Their singing in Act 2 is thrilling, and like the rest of the set, sounded wonderful on my sound system.  In fact, the sound and picture are so good throughout, that alone makes this Ring Cycle a great buy.  The new uses of the machine continue to delight the eye and support the story.  Jay Hunter Morris has even more difficult acting here, and does an excellent job.  But once again, it's Deborah Voigt who really knocked my socks off.  She sounds truly heroic here, from the opening love scene with Siegfried, to the immolation scene, where she unleashes the full power and beauty of her voice.  The end of the opera is lovely and moving, the depiction of the Rhine echoing the beginning in Das Rheingold, bringing the entire cycle back to where it began.  I truly adored this bluray set, and recommend it highly.",1348617600,17,7144,4.70483870967742
6859098,3,B00BL0MGB4,"I have never been a big fan of Levine's Wagner, especially his ""Ring"" performances, although in Bayreuth he faired less Italianette since there is only so much he could undo there.  I saw these performances live in the local theatres and his ""Rheingld"" here seemed more or less like before, again on the lighter, Italianette side; but his ""Walkure"" here showed some real promise.  Then Luisi stepped in.  I have studied and been to the entire ""Ring"" my whole adult life, and I never thought I would be unmoved by the ""Immolation Scene"" but it happended with Luisi.  He literally marched through out.  He indicated in his on-screen interviews that he wanted to take out the ""Germanic elements"" in the performances, and whatever you may view those to be, he certainly took all the fire and intensity out of the last two installments of this ""Ring.""  Most of the time he stays out of the way so as not to let the orchestra come unglued but there were a couple close moments, especially in ""Siegfried.""  But his light, quick concept seems totally at odds with the intent of the music and the dramas.  Fortunately, there was some very fine singing throughout, with some strong characterizations.  Too bad the camera-work got so closeup to show nose-hairs, dings in the sets, and other stage equipment and lighting.  And ""The Machine"" (as it became known) for a principal stage set - how tiring, even by the time the ""Ritt"" occurs in ""Walkure"" Act III - comical.  But for those unfamiliar or those who want a modern ""Ring"" should buy this to hear and see what is up with this greatest of all musical accomplishments - at least in the US.  For the real sound one has to go to Europe, and of course, especially Bayreuth itself for the sound this piece should have, although not necessarily for the staging (I have been and it can be distracting).",1348185600,6,1838,4.638888888888889
6859099,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Wagner championed the idea of reuniting the arts in his famous concept Gesamtkunstwerk (`a total work of art'), where the text, the voices, the music, the acting, the choreography and the staging would provide a unified new entity richer than the sum of its parts. During the last 35 years, there have been numerous new productions, but among them there are three that deserve to be called landmarks: Patrice Chreau at Bayreuth (1976), Otto Schenk at the Met (1987), and the current one by Robert Lepage. These three different Rings are good examples of how to stage an opera.

The ""Lepage, Levine and Gelb Ring,"" as Levine called it, can be judiciously considered one of the best achievements of the Met in recent years. Many skeptics have changed their mind after seeing the documentary about the preparation of the new production, ""Wagner's Dream,"" where its director, Susan Froemke says that ""the stagecraft unimaginable in the 19th century has made what seemed impossible possible."" The cast, the costumes, the acting, and ""the machine"" provided an opportunity to see the Ring with new eyes. And he Blu-ray edition of the Ring and ""Wagner's Dream"" is breathtaking.

It is important to highlight the large role played by Maestro Levine in the development of this new Ring. Even in his absence, everyone noticed his presence. Since the beginning he told Lepage that in spite of its cosmic dimension the Ring is a very intimate work and advised him to listen to the music and to follow the music. At the end, Lepage found himself completely transformed and said that ""the Ring is a revolutionary work of art ... You're not the same person once you've done the Ring.""  Neither are we after seeing it!",1348185600,8,1701,4.858620689655172
6859100,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Okay, so everyone has their favorite Ring. But this boxset consists of the HD telecasts from the Met  starting in October 2010 and finishing in February 2012.  If  you liked what you saw in the theaters, then you will love this on blu-ray.  The video and audio are spectacular. The cast is terrific. Just  watch the duet  between Kaufmann and Westbroek; totally believable  unlike some  other pairings on other sets.  I own 4 complete video sets of the Ring including the Bayreuth Kupfer set on laserdisc(recently released on blu-ray) and enjoy each one for different reasons. I also own the entire Solti ring on cd and a Toscanini Act 1  of Walkurie on disc.  But to me, this Ring is perfect for this era.  Some hate the ""machine"" but I don't even  notice  it anymore when  I am  so absorbed in the action and singing.  I have seen these in the theater; I was in a seat at opening night in 2010  for Rheingold, but the experience in a home theater with this  set  is  amazing.  I would give it 10 stars  if I could.  If you  must have traditional, then buy the last Met Ring  from  1990.  If you're looking  for avant-garde then  look here or at the Barcelona set.  Better  yet, buy them both and check out the Kupfer as well. What a choice. Who could complain  about that?",1348185600,24,1274,4.376623376623376
6859101,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This Blu-Ray version of the Ring is stunning. Having seen it live at the Metropolitan Opera I would like make two observations: 1) in spite of all the hoopla about the staging this is a conservative production for the most part adhering faithfully to Wagner's conception, and 2) the video experience is quite different from seeing it live.

Unlike the opera house, the video creates an amazing sense of intimacy with the singers through extreme close ups where faces sometimes fill the widescreen in dazzling, if sometimes unflattering, detail.  I often forgot I was viewing a live performance on an opera stage and felt I was with the singers in Wagner's fantasy.  These close-ups focus attention on the acting abilities of the singers, most of whom I felt were excellent, though some were less successful. The audio quality (more on that below) favors the voices and enhances this feeling of intimacy.  In general there are much more of these intimate visuals than full stage ones.  One does lose some of the sense of the overwhelming presence of Nature in these operas that I believe the much maligned staging successfully conveyed in the opera house.  All the scenery is done through light projections upon a movable platform, some giving the illusion of three dimensions, and this worked well for me when attending the performances, often so well that they distracted me from the performance itself.  Seen close-up in the video, the projections lose some of their effectiveness, especially when the spotlights that follow the singers overwhelm the background.  Also the projection details are blurrier, particularly so in Siegfried where they are extensively used, and where, because of this, some of the illusion of three dimensionality is lost.  However for me these are minor quibbles in an otherwise great video. The projections tend towards realism (often hyper-realism) rather than abstraction and for the most part I find them very effective.  But in the end it is the incredible visual intimacy which I found to be more compelling than in any other video version of the Ring I have previously viewed (Boulez, Levine, Barenboim, Mehta).

The Blu-Ray offers DTS HD Master 5.1 and PCM sound. I have only listened to the DTS choice. BUT there is something odd about the audio quality. The balance favors the voices. They are crystal clear, beautifully so. Yet I feel the voices lack authentic stage presence. When the singers turn their heads or move about there is little if no differentiation in the sound they project, something one would expect from distantly placed microphones and normal in all other live opera videos I have. There is also little or no stage noise. Because of that I suspect the voice audio was recorded from microphones the singers were wearing specifically for the recording. This also may have been a way to virtually eliminate the recorded sound of the stage machinery which so many complained about at the live performances.  The effect is subtle and not very distracting and enhances the feeling of intimacy described above, especially in the long monologues.  Has any one else noticed this? I generally prefer that the orchestra be favored over the voices in Wagner and was disappointed at times.  An example is the Ride of the Valkyries scene where I believe the orchestra is the main actor, not the singers.  However the sound, at least to my ears, becomes more balanced in the quieter sections and the orchestral detail I hear is simply amazing.

I rate this video version of the Ring higher than the original Levine version because of the superior sound and Hi Def picture quality.  The Mehta Ring was interesting but the weirdness of the production has worn me out.  I've always loved the sound of the Barenboim version and look forward to hearing it on the forthcoming Blu-Ray release.

If I haven't focused on the quality of the musicianship it is because I don't feel qualified to make definite musical judgments.  I'll leave that to other reviewers. I can only say what I like and I LOVED viewing and hearing this production, both live and on the Blu-Ray video.  I highly recommend it to fans of the Wagner Ring but enjoin them to see it live if they can.",1347926400,28,4204,4.892957746478873
6859102,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Just received my copy of the Robert LePage /Levine Ring and am looking forward to watching it on Blu-Ray as I did enjoy watching the PBS broadcast.

As a  result, the question concerning technology in the production itself, the use of video projection, triggered by the singers rather than ""pre-shot,"" to use Lepage's word, and the cinematic nature of much of staging, not just the 43 plank ""machine"" Lepage invented, is entirely missed.  If you watch the blu-ray, you are watching a film of a production meant to be seen, eventually, on film.  I admire this production for thinking about cinema without entirely thinking it through.  I know that sounds ridiculous.

(See, for example: """"And it is precisely the religious Parsifal that makes use of the film-like technique of scene-transformation that marks the climax of this dialectic: the magic work of art dreams its complete antithesis, the mechanical work of it.""
Theodor Adorno, In Search of Wagner, 109)."" Lepage is a brilliant special effects filmmaker who nevertheless imagines that technology is something that exists apart from live performance, that one can use in the service of live performance rather than dictate what happens in live performance. As a technology that has invaded, as it were, Lepage's production from the start and to which it is also destined form the start, film is not secondary but primary.  It is much like Alberich's ring.  Lepage has made a Faustian bargain, if I may call up a different opera based on a different legend, with cinema. But the blu-ray is definitely worth the price of admission.  This blu-ray set is by far and way the most watchable of all filmed productions of the Ring.  The camerawork and editing are so good you don't even notice them. And this blu-ray is technically superior in terms of sound and image quality as well.  It has moved the bar up many, may steps.  Levine's Rheingold and Walkure is stunning.  So is the singing and the acting.  I have never seen a better filmed opera delivered to blu-ray, including other blu-ray releases of Met HD simulcasts.  If you are interested in the way Wagner's leitmotif method of composition became the template for Hollywood cinema soundtracks, many of them composed by German and Austrian emigres, you will be especially interested in the way this blu-ray ends up, no doubt unintentionally, turning the music into an incredibly amazing film soundtrack.

6859104,1,B00BL0MGB4,"Maybe it ties for worst, the compeditor being the latest Traviata from the Met.
Both productions disconnect the visual from the musical and emotional.  The staging in the case of the Ring adds nothing to the understqanding of the drama, but rather serves as a distraction.
If this were a CD set, the souundtrack would be worth having, although Terfel would not be my choice for Wotan.
To contrast this staging with another with minimal background, watch the DVD of Die Walkure by Simon Rattle.  The backgrounds are so bare this might as well be a concert performance, but the direction is superb and the emotional intensity of the singers blazes from the screen. One forgets the backround and is swept by the music and actin.
Westbrook is the Seiglinde in both versions, but In the Rattle Walkure her passion burns up the stage. In the Met performance, she is barely acting.
I think that the problems encountered by the staging and poor direction affect the singers negatively, and  distract them rom the drama.

That is where Robert Lepage steps into and delivers with a wallop.  Worth every penny, believe me. The bonus disc is indispensable. Watch it before anything else. I had no idea of the risks the best voices in the universe take while walking up or  sliding down a multitude of pirate's planks.

I would hope that by now, the USA Blu-ray productions audio would finally catch up to the magnificent European productions that contain 7.1 DTS Master audio.

I realize that the description by Amazon lists the audio as DTS 5.1 HD.  My experience (sad to say) is that this info is not always accurate.  I am hoping to get a confirmation from someone who has played the Blu-ray disc.

6859109,4,B00BL0MGB4,"It's interesting that the first 11 reviews gave this either 5 stars or 1 star. I was going to side with the 5 star people. I saw this in the flesh at the Met and I thought it was fantastic. My only concern was, would you get the same scope of the production on a screen rather than in person. I bought the blu ray on day one, and then had my first misgivings.

I saw Das Rheingold twice: once in its first run in 2011, and again in the full cycle in 2012. The two things I found distracting in 2011 were both fixed by the time the full cycle was staged: the excessive creaks of the machine, and the Gods making their entrances by sliding down the set in a most un-Godlike manner. But on picking up this set I see that Das Rheingold is an early recording, 2010 even, and I skipped through to see that, yes, the Gods come sliding in!

(From other reviews I understand that early versions of the funeral pyre in Gotterdammerung were a bit feeble, but were much better in the full cycle. I haven't got that far in this set yet...)

So why not 1 star? For one thing, I thought this was a fantastic experience, musically and visually. I thought the set and its use were spectacular. Perhaps the critics (and I've only really seen Anthony Tomassini of the NY Times and Alex Ross of the New Yorker) and some of the other reviewers here have seen so many Rings that they need something to shock them rather than something to revel in? For me, this was only my second Ring (the first, which I saw on DVD only, was the Kupfer/Billy version). Both were fairly traditional, but I would rate this higher on most counts. (Graham Clark as Mime gets an extra point in the Kupfer/Billy version). For me, I find there is more than enough material for reflection in the music and words without needing some clever staging. There may come a time when I'm ready for Wild West, Corporate or Hydroelectric Rings, but I'm not there yet. In the meantime I will bask in this, and maybe nip to the kitchen for a moment just before anyone is due to slide in.

Postscript: I just wanted to add that Jay Hunter Morris is the best Siegfried I've seen! Not only can he sing the part, but he is totally believable to watch as well. All other Siegfrieds I've seen look like middle-aged men trying to look like headstrong teenagers.",1347321600,17,2296,4.30787037037037
6859110,5,B00BL0MGB4,"Loved the theater simulcasts in HD this year, and saw the PBS airing of ""Wagner's Dream"" last night. Fantastic music combined with stunning visual experience.  Wagner seems to sucessfully adapt to minimalist or interpretive staging better than any other composer's work.  I usually detest productions that mess with opera (Santa Fe's staging of Magic Flute in business suits, for instance), but this really works, really!  Get the Blu-Ray.  If you don't have Blu-Ray, get the player and order the Blu-Ray version of this set!

DO NOT ALSO ORDER THE SEPARATE DISK ""Wagner's Dream""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-s-Dream-Blu-ray/dp/B008MXMFRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner's Dream [Blu-ray</a>] I have just been informed that it is included in the Ring set (the fifth disk). Amazon forgets to tell you this -- however this is a great disk, but you don't have to buy it separately.  The interviews with Hunter, just up from Paris, Texas, are charming...and when he opens his mouth to sing, this man from just south of the Oklahoma border simply blows you away! This video really makes you appreciate all the work that goes into a new production.",1347321600,42,1191,5.552486187845304
6859111,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This year was going to be the year I learned to like opera. So my husband and I took to going to see the HD Met at our local theater. The first thing we saw... Das Rheingold, and we loved it. It did help to do a fair amount or reading first on the show to understand what Wagner was doing when it comes to the score so we both read some short essays on The Ring. I know this production really divided opera fans and critics as one that knows nothing about opera I loved it. Maybe in years time as I grow to understand things that may change but there are moments of such beauty in this piece that there will always be something that brings me back to this production. I have now watched 4 different productions of the Ring Cycle on DVD and still love moments in this more then the other ones. The opening of Das Rheingold is just perfect to me and the most convincing staging of the mermaid sequence, as well as the decent to the dwarves and the crossing of the rainbow bridge are all stunning moments. The whole of the first act of Die Walkure is charged with sexual energy in a way like no other production available on DVD right now, and Act 3 is awesome from the first moment of famous Ride to the ring of fire at the end. In Sigfried ""The Machine"" does get more use and has various backgrounds and levels as to make it more interesting but the stand out in this piece are the performances....sigh...  In the final part Twilight of the Gods I do agree that things get a little flat for a while, but that is something I have noticed in several of the productions I have watched. I don't know if there really is a way to sustain a tension and energy over 5 hours of anything.  In one of the intermission chats Deborah Voigt alluded to being in a  certain mental space while off stage so she can go out and chew the scenery again. When she did come back in did she ever. The confrontation scenes with here were mesmerizing to watch and hands down the best acting scenes for her. While not perfect this ring is still a great way to begin.",1347235200,80,2038,4.16751269035533
6859112,5,B00BL0MGB4,"I saw the ring at the local Cineplex and liked it much better than I thought I might.  Modern adaptations have gone over the top in trying to make the Ring a story it isn't.  It would be nice to see a modern production that follows Wagner's stage directions completely.  BUT this production with all its effects and machines somehow comes closer than most modern productions -- certainly including Bayreuth.  So I've ordered mine and am looking forward to seeing it on my own big screen in my own media room where the popcorn is not rancid and my feet don't stick to the floor.

But what I find interesting is that we can have this BluRay HD TV version for about $112 but it still costs about $150 to DOWNLOAD the Karajan version which is audio only and over 45 years old.  That makes this set an incredible deal with better sound, a wonderful orchestra, and HD Video to boot !!

Finally, I'm so glad the Met and Universal got together to release this material.  The Met has one of the best standing HD setups in all theater (in the world) and it was a shame that all the lesser theaters were releasing their stuff on Blu Ray (for some time) and we had NOTHING from the Met.  I have great hope for this new alliance.  May it produce wonderful HD productions for years to come.  (Now I only wish the Met would come up with a Netcast arrangement similar to the Berlin Philharmonic's ""Digital Concert Hall.""  For those of us living west of the Hudson, that would be a real boon.  The Cineplex was great but home is better.)",1347062400,22,1520,4.366548042704626

I have several friends who are ""Ring Fanatics"" (one did his dissertation on it) and they loved this production too. I love that they pushed the boundaries of live performance technology, and in my opinion, they had a ringing success. The projections look gorgeous on the BluRay, better than in the movie theatre.

8690541,5,B00BL0MGB4,"After watching Wagners Ring in early September, 2012 on PBS for 4 consecutive nights, I felt like I had self-immolated at the end! What an immensely gut-wrenching final scene! It took me a week to decompress.

It wasn't that I was just being introduced to Wagner for the first time; I had studied his work in Music Composition class at university (both the musical scores; the stories built on old legends, going back to the times of the Gods, creating half-men/ half-gods; discussing main themes like immortality; all within the context of old German legends). Besides this, I come from a strand of German lineage (I was born into a family with the name of one of the characters in this group of operas), so studying and performing music from my original homeland drew me in like a duck to water.

This Ring set is comprised of 4 operas: Das Reingold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, and Gotterdammerung.

The 4 operas recorded from this set were first performed and filmed live at The Metropolitan Opera Company in New York in 2011. They were then broadcast on PBS in early September, 2012. This box set not only contains BluRays of performances of the 4 operas; it also contains a 5th one  dealing with LePages mobile/ IT-enhanced stage and how it worked, to perfectly integrate into scenery that was so vivid that it looked almost out of this world. I don't think that I can ever see another opera again that isn't performed with LePages plank (lever-like) set, which is built and operated by LePages Canadian company, creating a wonderful collaboration between companies for the sake of art.

The operas had 2 different conductors: James Levine and then Fabio Luisi, who had to take over because of Levines health problems.

At the last moment, Texan Jay Hunter Morris also had to take over the entire role of Siegfried. The understudy of the sick original cast member was too afraid to take on this huge role and didn't want to damage his reputation, but Morris (3rd in line) stepped right up to the plate. He was absolutely riveting in his vocal timbre and performance. He performed in a state of being in the zone, and everyone watching and listening felt this, too. This role/ performance propelled him into international stardom. What a joy that this box set captures this.

Internationally acclaimed soprano Deborah Voigt in the role of Brunnhilde had just lost over 100 pounds before she took this role. The plank set had her exercising while working in these operas! She looked and sounded magnificent.

The other operatic singers also shined.

Run an internet search for the Metropolitan Opera and look for short video clips of these 4 operas, rehearsals, outtakes, and the behind-the-scenes happenings of LePages plank set. Especially look for The Ride of the Valkyries, which will be the finest rendition of this that you have ever seen! This will whet your appetite for purchasing this amazing boxed set.

The entire 5 disc BluRay set is manufactured by Deutsch Grammophone (there are subtitles in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese, so that listeners/ viewers understand the context of the story in a language that they can comprehend [all of the operas are sung in German]). The video is shot in HD, and there is a total of 1111 minutes (18 hours and 51.6 Minutes) in the 5 discs. Broken down into sections: the 4 operas contain 920 minutes (15.33 hours); the 5th disc, called Wagners Dream, dealing with the making of the Ring opera, is 114 minutes (1.9 hours). A final 72 minutes (1.28 hours) is devoted to extras.

(Note: One of my friends bought this box set for her family one Christmas, because funnily enough, she, too, comes from a German lineage, and her maiden name is also a part of The Ring! She bought this set so that her kids could learn more about their German heritage.)

This Ring box set should be part of every music and opera-lovers collection. People who are just being introduced to opera (including children and teens and adults who aren't yet fans) will find this rendition with the plank sets very believable and enjoyable to watch. This is the finest opera video set that I own, and I am very happy that I bought it.

I would give this boxed set 10 stars if I could!",1519603200,8,4207,4.738714090287278

8690543,5,B00BL0MGB4,"This production has caught a lot of flak from people nitpicking over the use of the Machine.  They say it creaks (you can't hear ANY creaking on the DVD), it's RegieTheatre (actually it's the opposite), that it distracts (the sets are beautiful and atmospheric) or that Wagner wouldn't have approved (actually he was interested in every innovation available to realize his staging vision).  These criticisms are a pity because they've taken away attention from the fact that this production has a tremendous cast, first rate orchestra, and a gifted conductor.

I've seen a few Rings on DVD including Boulez/Chereau, Barenboim/Kupfer, and the Levine/Schenk Met production.  Eric Owens as Alberich and Jay Hunter Morris as Siegfried are easily the best out of these, and Bryn Terfel as Wotan stands head and shoulders above all others for voice, presence, and overall convincingness.  You want more?  How about Jonas Kaufmann as Siegmund!?!

The other cast members all perform up to at least average standards for a major Ring -- there are no real weaknesses.  And while there was certainly more fire musically in Levine's earlier Met Ring with Schenk, and more sharp detail in Barenboim at Bayreuth, I would still call the music a strength of this production.

Finally, some of the scenes are just breathtaking.  Yes, they used a Machine, but they did so with artistry, attention to detail, and vision of the whole.  For example, instead of a curtain or an empty stage, the prelude pieces are ""illustrated"" with explanatory action that add depth and fill in background.

Highly recommended.",1515369600,,1589,5.0926640926640925
