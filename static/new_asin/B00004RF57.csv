All humans of that time, who also experienced the descent into the dark age, are being reincarnated today.
The thrilling documentation shows the return of the Atlantean light children and allows deep insight into the role of the light workers and brotherhoods of Atlantis. It shows why some souls reincarnate today and act as enviromental protectionists, therapists, artists, esoterics etc. for the healing of the earth.
Addresses also the Space Brotherhood events - 11:11, the hollow earth, Shambhala and Agharta.

Interviews: Solara, Barbara Marseniak, Jasmuheen, Wladimir Tarzisky, Prof. Hurtak
