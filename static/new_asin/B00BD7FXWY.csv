Yes, the war. I was one of those peace-loving hippies, the whole involvement was just wrong. I was NEVER one of those who disrespected the military. Now, it is my job to do everything I can to help them. And this song says it all, beautifully!
I will play it in honor of them at our fund raiser for the Wounded Warrior Project. It is well done, vocals and instruments are right on. Can not wait to hear the rest of the songs! Great piece of Americana! Thank you for making this CD",1376524800,,690,4.195488721804511
