8227098,5,B000X7S90I,"Far better then you would have expected movie about a group of green and young volunteers wanting to become airborne rangers in the elite 82nd airborne division which incidentally is now, in 2014, being regulated to a US Army infantry support unit: Very probably in not having enough man, or volunteers, to fill its ranks. The movie has to do with 18 year old Pvt. Eddie Slocum, Bobby Diamond, who in trying to prove himself is at the same being put down and ridiculed by fellow paratrooper Pvt. Rocky Layman, Robert Christian, as being a wimp and momma's boy. In the end Eddie heroically saves Rocky's life, by risking his own, on his first parachute drop thus earning a grateful Rocky's life long respect.",1525219200,,707,4.709677419354839

8227100,2,B000X7S90I,"Danger. This one is a fraud. It is called ""Airborne"" but is really a ten nminute short of ""Baby Face xxx"". I asked Amazon for different copies and all were the same. If you actually get the movie, which I doubt, it stars Bobby Diamond from 1950s TV fame who goes through Army jump school at Fort Bragg, NC. No not Fort Benning in Columbus, GA, it is actually Fort Bragg. That location was still around in the 1980s and was used for jump refresher and perhaps jumpmaster training. Don't know if it is still there. No 250 foot towers at FT Bragg, just the 34 footers. For thsoe who spent time or careers in the airborne, it's fun to see all that stuff again. If you order it, insist that it be reviewed prior to shipment or you'll be stuck with a fraudulently distributed short subject film from the 1930s or early 1940s and have to waste time and money getting it back to Amazon.",1316822400,2,878,4.295180722891566
8227101,5,B000X7S90I,"This is a nice little movie. Very rarely seen, it's a film about a young smalltown boy named Eddie Slocum, who wants to join the army airborne division. During training, his best friend is a comic beatnik and his biggest enemy is a tough guy bully. During his time he also falls for a local girl. Eddie is played charmingly by Bobby Diamond, who is perfect as the good natured innocent good guy, who sometimes seems like he's in over his head. I got choked up towards the end during the parachute training jump scene. I can't tell you why without revealing too much of the plot. This movie works on a lot of levels, try it.",1291248000,5,623,4.333333333333333
8227102,1,B000X7S90I,"The Movie that I expected was not the movie that was dubbed.  Amazon was great about sending another one immediately but the 2nd one had the same problem.  The movie itself, if you can get it, is a great classic.  My husband's Dad was in it and my husband was there as a child when they filmed it at Ft. Bragg.
I'd just like a copy for him!
Someone needs to find out though why the wrong movie was dubbed.
I have to put One Star on this only because it HAS to be rated.  I tried not putting anything but cannot continue without something.  But please do not order this movie until you know for sure that the problem has been solved",1231200000,2,631,4.097560975609756
