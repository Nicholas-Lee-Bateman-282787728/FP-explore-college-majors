890664,4,6304465068,"Strong performances from the leads John Lynch and Jacqueline McKenzie give this film its power. Lynch has a face that's perpetually aching, and McKenzie's defiance blows through.
The main characters meet at a ""clubhouse"" for the mentally ill, and soon fall in love. With the blessing of their doctors and the reservations of their family, they move in together. Naturally, complications arise when Kate (McKenzie) gets pregnant - limiting her access to her medications. Omens, good and bad, come from Australia's version of the ""Wheel of Fortune"" gameshow.
McKenzie and Lynch really carry this film, which suffers slightly from the minor missteps of an ambitious first-time director. Top-notch character actors, such as Colin Friels, are wasted when secondary roles are written into the script and then neglected. The foreshadowing, especially from the soundtrack, is pretty heavy-handed. Nevertheless, the care given by the director and the actors to the central love-story makes this a compelling drama.
Highly recommended for fans of Australian cinema, and those who like stories that challenge the conventional ideas of romance.",971308800,5,1132,5.511494252873563
890665,5,6304465068,"This is a powerful drama about two people fighting their inner demons to be together and to share their love. The film does more than just tell a story, it carries a message too.
Despite their illness, the leading  couple possess the full range of normal human desires, emotions and  motivations. Plus, in their own way, they were always acting in a rational  manner. It was just that they were doing so in a world that we do not  perceive as being the real one.
Some of the supporting cast seemed a  little flat but Lynch and MacKenzie put in a stunning performance. The film  was very well put together too. The pace of the story was always maintained  and the film was a visual delight too. It is easy to see why it picked up  technical awards to go with those for acting.
Truely, a film that will  touch your heart.",955411200,9,819,4.3355263157894735

It's a charming, moving depiction of  mental illness and the power of love.",916444800,7,246,5.256410256410256

here's the truth: weak story told by the weakest ""actors"" assembled.

not worth the viewing time. you will watch it/you will die",1411344000,,167,5.148148148148148
7873015,4,6304465068,I bought this movie for my son & daughter -in-law as it was recommended viewing my son having a mental illness. I found it very disturbing & so sad as people really don't understand the complexities of such illnesses & the effect on family members. I can understand why this is recommended viewing for any one with a family member suffering mental problems also for any one who may know of someone in that position,1355616000,2,414,4.533333333333333
7873016,4,6304465068,"A great movie about love and schizophrenia. Quality of the VHS was good, only wish it would come out on DVD!",1290297600,2,108,4.190476190476191
7873017,5,6304465068,"This is a good movie.  The relationship between these two is so childlike and so funny at the begining.  These are two people suffering from things beyond their control and trying to make a life for themselves.  I'll give away the movie if I try to give any kind of serious review.

Lets just say, I no longer have the film because a friend refuses to give it back.  Now, I have to buy a new one.  This is the best movie I have ever seen and it broke my heart.",1221091200,3,460,4.0
7873018,5,6304465068,"I was lucky enough to get to see this film in my college psychology class.
It truly is a heartbreaking and beautiful love story involving two mentally ill individuals. This is rarely a story that is told; usually mentally ill people are darkly portrayed.
It was great to see a movie about such pure love. It has a strong message to it.
Love CAN change you, but it CAN'T always fix you.
Angel Baby gives you a different outlook on mentally ill people, and any film that does that I hold in very high regard.
The acting performances are superb. John Lynch is perfect on every level. The direction and screenplay are top notch.
I cannot think of a better movie dealing with both the good and bad sides of being mentally ill.
I wish there were more movies like this.
Angel Baby is a raw moving and honest look at two mentally ill people who are deeply in love.

7873019,5,6304465068,"John Lynch is one of my very favorite actors, I think he's just amazing.  This is his greatest performance, and his best movie.  It works on every level - acting, script, music, direction - never sinking to ""Aw, aren't they CUTE?"" as so many romances about ""challenged"" people do.
And it's surprisingly funny.
Highly recommended.",1066780800,4,329,4.963636363636364
7873020,4,6304465068,this is a brilliant australian film which deals with a love story between two people who suffer from schizophrenia. their love is strong and unbreakable and is portrayed amazingly by both Lynch and McKenzie. they get pregnant and that's when the saddness of the film starts to build. in order for the baby to survive she has to stop taking her medication. both stopped and taking their medication and it leads to some painful events. their hope doesn't die and it's amazing how they hang on. there is a scene when both of them are standing by a bridge looking down at the sea and you can sense how the wish to end their life is written on their faces. but all of a sudden McKenzie starts flapping her hands and immitating a seagull and Lynch joins her. their will to live is stronger now they they are creating a life and even though they are caged within their minds and not free as a seagull they have to make it. it's a beautiful and unique love story told in a simple way but that's what make it more effective.,978566400,9,1015,4.347368421052631
