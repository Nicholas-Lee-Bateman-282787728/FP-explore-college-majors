Recognizes that a modern classroom with its heavily regulated behavior can be an environment hostile to compassion and connection and addresses that both as a part of the inciting tragedy and as an obstacle to dealing with it.",1329091200,14,372,5.2

5043818,5,B006ZUMMKU,"Monsieur Lazar is a touching story, it gives lesson about how students and teachers facing rough times after the incident.

5043819,4,B006ZUMMKU,"Similar to another film which I watched recently, THE CLASS, MONSIEUR LAZHAR deals with the goings-on in a classroom and the students' relationship with their teacher. However, in contrast to the previous film, MONSIEUR LAZHAR focuses on something that was a little more intimate and relatable to someone who isn't French or French-Canadian. After a schoolteacher commits suicide in her classroom, the students are left in shock as well as in need of a new teacher. The substitute comes in the form of an Algerian immigrant, Bachir Lazhar. Although it is initially hard for the students to warm up to him, eventually they do and he helps them in their process of grieving in addition to having some of his own. One thing that struck me was just how unassuming this film actually was. I kind of expected it to be along the same lines as THE CLASS, but it ended up being a lot more emotionally involving, which I really liked. Grief is something that we all go through at some point in our lives, and seeing how it affects children was an interesting approach to take. Of course, the performances were all excellent, even from the child actors. The clear standout is Fellag, who played Monsieur Lazhar himself. There was a certain warmth and honesty in his performance, as well as subtle shades of melancholy. You got the sense that he was really affected by what happened in his past, and just as affected by what happened to his students. I'd also like to mention the score, which was quite minimal. Outside of some classical music, there really wasn't a whole lot. More importantly, the score never interferes with the film's many emotional moments, allowing them to be powerful on their own. The only issue I took with the film was that there could have been a little more screen time or information about Monsieur Lazhar, given that the film is named after him. I also was caught off-guard at how abruptly the film ended. Not that I needed any more closure, but I was so invested in the story that I kind of wish there had been a little more. Overall, I'd say this was about on par with THE CLASS, maybe edging it out slightly. It certainly isn't light viewing, but it is rewarding in its own way.",1426550400,8,2200,4.614795918367347

5043848,5,B006ZUMMKU,"I give this film five stars because I was thoroughly engaged, entertained and moved. I was pleased that the plot was complex and developed enough to keep my interest without being predictable.
The film explores a few different serious social themes in a thought-provoking and moving way, without telling us as the viewer what we should believe. In fact, much is left unsaid or unanswered about the complex, but well motivated character of Monsieur Lazhar himself. There is more to be inferred and interpreted than this film's one-and-a-half hour length would suggest. The tone of the film may be more somber than some people would care for, but the children in the film contribute to some humorous and charming scenes.
The film is in French with English subtitles and takes place at a middle school in French Canada. Anyone who appreciates foreign films, who is learning French, or who favors the art of cinema over the art of marketing rubbish to a mass audience would enjoy this film as well.",1390435200,,994,4.852941176470588

5043864,3,B006ZUMMKU,"Monsieur Lazhar is certainly a worthy film, but in the end it is a typical product of modern ""thought-provoking"" cinema i.e. it ticks off a number of boxes and covers issues of migration, extremism, personal tragedy, education, suicide, and hysteria around paedophilia while never quite coalescing into a cinematic vision of life. The whole thing remains a bit superficial and dry, as if the filmmaker were trying to make a film that could be discussed by sixth-formers. It seems to me a shortcoming that a man who has lost everything in quite such a terrible way as Monsieur Lazhar should not really be shown in terms of how he feels confronting a new world in these circumstances - we hardly see him out of the classroom at all, except for a few exchanges with colleagues which are also superficial and added in the service of advancing one or other of the arguments. You may say that his isolation is the key, but we get no sense really of his state of mind - he's as two-dimensional as Mr Benn.

To the extent that the focus is on the pupils, it also seems too distant from how they are, and somehow too politicised. This is because the film has a lot to get through. To put it like this does underplay the sensitivity of the direction, perhaps, but it doesn't quite add up to a portrait of childhood like Les 400 Coups or Au Revoir Les Enfants. There's so much less life in it. It seems to me that we need to get back to filmmaking of vision rather than point-making - in other words, a view of film as art rather than a tract, more or less. If you are told the story of Monsieur Lazhar, there is really no need to see the film, the visual interest is so minimal, and there is so little of aesthetic value. To some extent the film issues a challenge to authority and obsessive box-ticking, in the form of Monsieur Lazhar himself who is an excellent teacher who would not be allowed to teach in the system. He also plays a much more useful role than the psychologist who is brought in to deal with the children, even if his actions have such consequences for himself and others. This certainly seems to ring true. But in other ways the film is a product of that same soulless society where we can only deal with things by making an issue out of them and putting them into a box. Only in the last few minutes does it start to work cinematically, in my view, and even then it is based in large part on something written. (This, and one other key scene involving the boy we see in the first scene are actually very moving.) After watching it I turned to Rohmer's La Femme de l'aviateur, and the difference was so palpable - Rohmer takes the everyday and the banal and reveals it to be something else, and something wonderful happens. By contrast, modern films such as this one take on the biggest themes but tend to reduce everything to a kind of banality in the interest of conveying their message and promoting debate.",1383955200,3,2921,4.409259259259259

OK, so maybe in Quebec or Montreal life is so wretched that this movie, in comparison, *IS* a poignant bundle of laughs and fun 'coming of age' story. Perhaps in Europe this is droll, amusing, and witty. I didn't crack a smile the entire time and regret spending the time on watching it.  This is a major problem with Amazon downloads; you have to depend on such sketchy information.

It's well made, and the kids are incredible actors so I give it a couple of stars. But the storyline is unrealistic at best. There is maybe 2 scenes where more than 2 kids even GRIN at the same time.

The movie revolves around a suicide, asks daring question about if the person who killed herself acted irresponsibly by spreading her personal sorrow and despair over the lives of so many children and an institution.
But ultimately healing happens through the living and their small acts of loving each other.

5043891,5,B006ZUMMKU,"This film covers a lot of ground regarding suicide, loss, grief and coping.  Though the acting is generally excellent -- This movie features exceptional performances by the child actors who seem to be wise beyond their years.  The lead role of Bachir Lazhar (Mohamed Sad Fellag) appears to be almost nave in his approach to his new life in Montreal as a teacher.  But one soon discovers that he is merely wearing a mask.  Considering what he has been through, Monsieur Lazhar becomes an exemplary replacement for his predecessor.  He ends up being somewhat more outspoken than is ideal for a person in his (tentative) position.  Yet his sincerity ultimately helps him to win over his students as he helps them to cope with their trauma.  The understated approach of the director (Philippe Falardeau) works well in this context.  The d&eacute;nouement of the film in particular elucidates what can happen to an individualistic professional within the bureaucracy of the North American public education system.  This movie also says much about the perception of an unexplainable / mysterious death -- As seen from a child's point of view.  The quasi-cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; aspect of the film, along with the snowy grays which feature so prominently in this picture, add tone and texture to the moving story line.

5043904,5,B006ZUMMKU,"I only have a few things to add to what has already been written here about this excellent work of art.

First, I'd like to emphasize the specifically North American context of the school system: Rules, procedures, overspecialization of tasks. The schoolroom teacher is not allowed to be present while the ""psychologist"" performs her ""therapy"" on the traumatized class. He, on the other hand, has the human wisdom necessary to help some of the kids -- and he is punished by the bureaucracy, in part for the good he does.

Second, in a very complete way,  the film shows the ""good"" side of bureaucracy as well:  Bashir the teacher is squished by the school rules, but he obtains refugee status in Canada thanks to other government procedures that, in the end,  operate with justice.

Third, the North American French-speaking kids, bright and likeable as they may be, are less ""French"" in their culture than their North African, Algerian, ""foreign,"" arabophone teacher. They can't relate to Balzac or Moliere, while for Bashir French literature is an integral part of his being.

The dynamics of faculty relations in the small school are perfectly convincing, which is not often the case in films. [I taught art and music in a grade school for two anxious semesters, by the way, decades ago at the beginning of my adult life.] As is so predictable, the brightest children are both more perceptive and more vulnerable than their teachers.

5043931,5,B006ZUMMKU,"I have never been so thoroughly engaged in watching a movie as this one. Bravo to this Quebec filmmaker Philip Falardeau for touching the heart of a retired teacher in a very special way. This film has a number of things going for it: one, it effectively addresses a package of interconnecting issues within the framework of a very believable story; two, the acting is terrific in that it plays to the emotional tempo of the plot - no overacting or histrionics here; three, its open-ended conclusion speaks to a realism not found in many North American films these days; and, four, the film is very down-to-earth in how it handles the many challenges facing administrators, teachers, parents, janitors, and most importantly students in a school year hit hard by tragedy. On the first count, there is plenty to mull over in terms of understanding some of life's big questions: how and why children grieve; how does the public perceive teachers; how are immigrants received in a very closed society like Quebec; how do children relate to children during a sudden crisis; and how people cope with the loss of a loved one. Within this context, all the acting is appropriately focused on trying to clarify and resolve the problems that emerge when people sometimes feel alienated, are misunderstood, are lied to, become uncertain of the future, or are just plain overwhelmed by a personal loss. As the movie finishes, the audience is left with an incomplete feeling that though people can come together to achieve a better understanding of each other's needs, the problems never really go away; we just learn how to handle them better and move on with our lives. To that end, Bachir Lazhar has to be one of those winsome characters who because of personal adversities is able to act compassionately when dealing with others in similar straits. While there is copious amounts of pain here, there is more than enough real love to offset it. Be prepared for a couple of well-timed surprises as you become absorbed in this most poignant of human tragedies. Lots of food for thought in this heart-warming and heart-rending production.",1357257600,3,2124,4.886426592797784

This is not a light and frilly film. It brings you quickly into the minds and feelings of a wide range of people while exploring the cultural and emotional differences that make schools such interesting places. The audience is methodically burdened with a charged school environment and then brought to a clear, if not, resolution. With plot threads including terrorism, politics, immigration, the current school climate, teaching, parenting, and death, this movie will leave you with a lot to think about.",1356825600,4,828,4.756944444444445

5043935,5,B006ZUMMKU,"This is a beautiful and tender film about love and loss.  It's set in a primary school in French-speaking Canada during a snowy winter; the main adult character - a recent refugee from Algiers - is teaching a class of children and helping them come to terms with their own loss.

It's a thoughtful and intelligent film, which draws out important timeless philosophical issues - for instance, issues such as when are we to blame for another's actions (including another person's death or suicide) and how do we deal with the consequences of our own actions when we are in the wrong?

Plenty of other contemporary issues - such as the unfairness and stupidity of bureaucracy - are also running themes throughout the film.

All these issues are presented with subtlety and good taste.  For instance, a love story forms a central thread through the story, and there is much sadness too - but there are no soaring violins, no gaudiness, no overwrought emotion.  To the contrary, one needs to watch the characters' expressions carefully and listen to their quiet words to perceive the deep emotion.

This would be a great film to share with children - especially because the film treats children as intelligent, and respects their feelings and their views.  Also, most of the characters are children, and they play as important a role in the film as the adults.

Notwithstanding the serious underlying themes, it's also lively and humorous (I laughed as often as I cried!), moving along at a pace that keeps us engaged in the story.",1355875200,,1526,4.816091954022989

It is a French Canadian film about school and children and teachers, about death and suicide, about immigration and political asylum.
The title hero is the prototype of the good man. Bachir Lazhar is an Algerian in Montreal. His exact status is one of the themes of the plot, so no more about that.
He is a substitute teacher in a class of 11-12 year olds. The previous teacher had inexplicably chosen to hang herself in the classroom, for the kids to find her.

5043942,5,B006ZUMMKU,"This is a beautifully rendered picture of an Algerian man, Bashir Lazhar, who has escaped to Canada from political persecution in his home country.  Due to the suicide of a teacher in a primary school in Montreal, M. Lazhar manages to secure a job as an emergency replacement.  He tells the principal that he has many years of experience teaching in Algeria and that he is now a Canadian citizen, neither of which is true.  As we learn more of his background we find out that his wife and daughter were killed in a fire in their apartment building that he believes was set deliberately by his enemines. He is trying desperately to secure permanent status in Canada while he is trying equallly desperately to adjust to the task of teaching in this somewhat progessive school where the kids sit in a semicircle and speak back to the teacher.  He remedies that by changing the seats to straight lines, insisting on discipline, even to the point of cuffing a boy on the head when he speaks up.

He doesn't sleep much as night, we see him in conference with his lawyer and doing his laundry alone in his small, spare apartment.  His deeply lined face betrays the deep grief that he is hiding in his soul.  Echoing that grief is that of the children who adored their last teacher and who have not come to terms with their feelings.  Two children, especially, the ones who saw the teacher hanging from the pipe in the schoolroom, are the most traumatized.  We see him making adjustments from the teaching methods that he undoubtably grew up with, a dictation from Balzac.  He watches a lively warm young drama teacher whose room is filled with color.  She takes an interest in him, has him over for dinner, gives him an African violet plant.

The cast is first rate, starring Mohammed Fellag, as Bashir Lazhar.  ""Bashir"" means ""bringer of good news"" he tells the class.  And he does, in the midst of his own grief and ackwardness, manage to bring goodness and healing to the children.  Besides Fellag, the two actors who play the most troubled children give extraordinary performances.  Emilion Neron brought tears and chills to me in his major scene.

The story opens in the midst of winter in Montreal, with snow piled high and ends at the spring thaw.  There is an ongoing theme of a chrysalis waiting for its time to open up running through the story.  There is warmth, goodness and humor in the film as well as sorrow, frustration and injustice.  It's all calibrated just right.  Without succombing to banal sentimentalism we see deep feeling.  I highly recomment this film.  Bring some Kleenex.",1353196800,2,2593,4.6629955947136565
5043943,4,B006ZUMMKU,"""Monsieur Lazhar"" can be a moving movie if one is part of the education field, as I have only recently. But a most worthy film for anyone.  The insight to the children is what anyone in a classroom sees on a daily basis, along with the conflicts these children see both inside and outside school, something we would like to avoid but is as much a part of the job as the teaching.

I believe Fellag, who plays Lazhar, was a stand-up comic before this movie, a transition he makes easily much like our own Robin Williams and a few other comedians.  Their ability to be more unrestrained on stage let's them be more flexible, as well as successful and believable, in their dramatic endeavors.

5043945,5,B006ZUMMKU,"""Monsieur Lazhar"" is a highly acclaimed Canadian French-language film set in contemporary Montral, written and directed by Philippe Falardeau, adapted from Evelyne de la Cheneliere's original stage play.  It is one of those gentle films that delivers a powerful punch, with everything beautifully understated throughout, with its events firmly rooted in reality. The acting is everywhere superb and delightfully natural, with some of the most powerful performances delivered by the children around whose lives the film really revolves.  The theme of unexplained and seemingly meaningless death, the working out of grief and of guilt for the survivors is explored at many levels in subtle and sensitive ways and with no small amount of (appropriate) humour and pathos. The film also serves as something of a commentary on our times, and the paradoxically dehumanising consequences of overly rigid legislation driven by fear of litigation and in the name of human rights.

While by no means delivering very much by way of a feel good factor (and especially eschewing the altogether too obvious happy ending) the film nevertheless comes across as uplifting and enormously satisfying.

5043953,5,B006ZUMMKU,"The basis of this film is quite simple; a Montreal school teacher hangs herself in the classroom where she teaches her young charges. One of the boys Simon, discovers the body and raises the alarm. With the ensuing scandal it becomes nigh on impossible to get a replacement teacher and the kids are clearly traumatised by the whole experience.

Enter Monsieur Lazhar (Mohammed Fellag) he is from Algeria where he claims he was a teacher and he would like to step in and help. So faced with a decision of no teacher or a very keen one indeed, he gets the gig. The thing is that he is a man with a past and a tragic one too. Algeria has suffered years of terror and he and his family are one of its victims. He is also an asylum seeker and could face deportation at any time as his case is pending. This side of his life he keeps from everybody. He throws himself into connecting with the children and in doing so manages to unravel the truth of the past and the hostilities that the children have been harbouring amongst themselves.

This was an utterly absorbing film with performances from all involved that were brilliant. Emilien Neron who plays Simon is excellent but the real star is Mohammed Fellag who brings a warmth and humanity that is as touching as it is revealing about the human condition and possibly cultural attitudes.

This was taken from the play by Evelyne de la Cheneliere but has transferred to the screen with no hitches, there is a bit of love interest, no bedroom naughtiness and no real action. Yet this just shines through as a testament to great film making. In French with sub titles and a whole bucket of heart felt emotion - excellent.",1348790400,6,1666,4.491749174917492

5043955,3,B006ZUMMKU,"If Quebec, Canada subsidized this film, they are telling people to stay away.  If you are a psychologist or a psych student needing to write a paper this film may be your salvation.  If you are like me and are looking for a couple of entertaining hours, find another film.  The theme of shooting the whole thing is dreary surroundings and with a depressing winter ambiance is only further emphasized as the story line develops.  Some of the themes - the student's parents - were cardboard cutouts made with a cookie cutter. Though I stayed with this to the end, I was relieved when it was over. The logical of the plot development seemed to have been violated when earlier hints were confirmed.  The only thing I took away was that I found another depressing part of the world to avoid.",1346457600,3,786,4.546099290780142
5043956,5,B006ZUMMKU,"Monsieur Lazhar was my favorite film in 2011. So charming, so honest and tragic in some ways. The acting is fantastic, but it's the way the director depicts the difficult topics of immigration, and the role a well-meaning, yet imperfect teacher, plays in helping students deal with loss, is that makes this film so endearing. And despite tragedy, the film keeps a positive and hopeful note until the end. The kids are charming, the dialogue is well-paced (those who speak French will appreciate it even more but the translation is pretty accurate). It's just a gorgeous films, with the right mix of drama and hope. No wonder it was nominated for an Oscar. I highly recommend it.",1346198400,4,678,4.803418803418803
5043957,5,B006ZUMMKU,"An elementary school teacher commits suicide, hanging herself in her classroom, and an Algerian immigrant Bashir Lazhar is hired to take over the class. Though he has experience of teaching in Algeria for nineteen years, Monsieur Lazhar, now in Montreal, finds it a little difficult to adapt to the school's system. But what torments Monsieur Lazhar more than anything is his painful past that still haunts him.

Though the story involves some serious themes, ""Monsieur Lazhar"" is nothing dismal or depressing. Mohamed Sad Fellag (credited as Fellag) turns in a fine performance, bringing dignity and low-key humor to the role of Monsieur Lazhar, who, despite several missteps - dictating Balzac is too much for elementary school students - helps the shocked young students face reality and move on in their life. No wonder Monsieur Lazhar is loved and respected by the children.

Some part of the motives of characters, or the causes of incidents, is left to our imagination. Why did Monsieur Lazhar have to leave Algeria? Why did his predecessor commit suicide? Why did the class's student Alice suddenly become hostile to another student Simon? Knowing the characters and their past is part of the strength of the film, where the story unravels like a first-rate mystery.

The Canadian film is also about the modern educational system seen from an outsider's point of view. None of the characters, adults and children alike, is ""bad."" Teachers and the school's principal are all decent people. Still, the film suggests there is something not quite right about what is going on in school. It is not an indictment, but a suggestion or analysis, which is all the more effective in making us think.

The Oscar-nominated film in 2012 (for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to ""A Separation"") is based on a play by velyne de la Chenelire (who appears in the film as Alice's mother). Quiet and thought-provoking drama ""Monsieur Lazhar"" well deserves nomination.",1346112000,3,1960,5.0588235294117645
5043958,5,B006ZUMMKU,"The French have a way with children and cinema. This film - though based in Quebec - continues the tradition. In this case, though, the teacher shares equal place with the children.
The editing is perfect, avoiding long scenes on the one hand, and overly ""emotional"" ones on the other. It's heartwarming, yet simple. But maybe not so simple, because the teacher, Mr Lazhar, is anything but predictable in his interaction with not only the children, but adults too. Anyway, you don't have to be a fan of French language cinema per se to enjoy the film. It will be an addition to your video library that you will cherish for years to come.",1346112000,2,637,4.5964912280701755

The difficulties that teachers of young children have are also addressed, as the school must strike a balance between the allowing the bonding of teachers and students and protecting the kids from predators.

5043962,5,B006ZUMMKU,"There is no shortage of good French language films about children and their teacher(s). Though this one is set in Montreal, it has many of the endearing qualities that French directors bring to their portrayal of the interaction between children and adults.

What makes this film excellent is its overall tone. It's touching, it's heartwarming and ultimately sad, but in an almost uplifting way. The acting - the children - is flawless.
And while the subject matter of death is at the core of the film, it is enveloped in a
feeling of awe and detachment at how the kids deal with it, and themselves, and a humanistic
portrayal of the teacher who has to take on the class following the suicide of their previous teacher. The teacher himself though has his own understated but real demons to cope with. But the heart of the film, including most of its scenes, take place in a classroom.

Technically, the film has a near perfect touch. Scenes end when ""they should"" instead of being drawn out for unneeded effect (and the ending included), histrionics are absent, and it flows like a calm stream with potentially turbulent undertones. It's a film ultimately about life, love, respect, hope and endurance.

It's a film you'll enjoy owning so that it can be viewed on multiple occasions. And being a foreign film, you can bet that most of your friends and family haven't seen it.",1339200000,36,1375,4.7447698744769875

5043965,5,B006ZUMMKU,"How is a class of eleven/twelve-year olds to cope with a tragedy that suddenly and out of the blue takes away their teacher? How do parents and teachers react to the trauma the children are experiencing?  The school principal is under pressure to keep things ""normal"", none of the other teachers can take on the class, one school councillor is designated for the class of twenty plus young minds - a crisis of great proportion... Into this challenging scenario walks Bashir Lazhar and offers himself as the ideal replacement teacher.  With great subtlety and compassion does the film, Monsieur Lazhar, explore the evolving relationships between teacher and students, among various teachers and last but not least, between Bashir Lazhar at the school and his personal struggles beyond.  While set in Montreal, Quebec,  the messages of the film are nor locality specific, and  could happen anywhere. The story touches on the different ways of dealing with loss and guilt, with honesty, lies and pretense, with prejudice and expediency.  And finally, how the coping mechanisms of adults cannot easily be transferred to those of children living through a crisis. The story concentrates on two of the children, Simon and Alice, their growing hostility and Bashir's strict yet sensitive methods in dealing with the emotional struggles that the children go through.

Mohamed Fellag's acting in the role of Monsieur Lazhar is excellent, his interpretation of his character utterly convincing in his unassuming and often understated acting.  The child actors, especially the two interpreting Simon and Alice, come across as natural and genuine.  Philippe Falardeau, the film's Canadian writer/director joins Denis Villeneuve who directed ""Incendies"" in 2010 in gaining international recognition. Both their films were nominated for the Academy Award for best foreign-language film.  [Friederike Knabe]",1331164800,60,1892,5.448630136986301
