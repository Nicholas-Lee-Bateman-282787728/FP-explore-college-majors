8384185,4,B002YECA4O,"My 4 year old loves trains, and he really likes Choo Choo Bob. The only bad thing about this DVD is that there is no ""play all"" option when playing the DVD.
(It's difficult to find Choo Choo Bob DVD's, unless one orders them online from the Choo Choo Bob store).",1456099200,,262,4.1568627450980395

8384187,5,B002YECA4O,"Our 3 year old loves Choo Choo Bob. And for once it's a show for kids about trains that is for kids, but I as a parent can enjoy as well. It has 3 episodes, talks about scale, about riding miniature trains and has ""funny"" characters for the kids.",1442707200,,246,4.040816326530612

8384190,5,B002YECA4O,"These videos are absolutely great!  My son is 2 1/2 and has loved these for the last year.  They are slow paced, have GREAT songs, and teach all about trains in a fun, wacky way!  I highly recommend these videos.",1300838400,,212,4.25
8384191,5,B002YECA4O,"Well-produced for a small-scale TV show, Choo-Choo Bob has plenty for all ages to enjoy.  The youngest railfans can learn about model and full-scale trains, and there's plenty of corny humor along the way for parents to appreciate.  With jokes, a rat puppet, and trains galore, the show is a real treat.  Many people lament the loss of good children's TV shows--well, here's a current one!",1268524800,,389,4.863636363636363
