8426586,1,B004EA2DVQ,"Poor quality of the CD. It all looks like it was produced at home. It is not worth the price.
They charged me about $15 for shipping but then shipped the item for $1.50",1381536000,,168,3.9705882352941178
8426587,5,B004EA2DVQ,"The Imelda May DVD is amazing. Of course one has to remember this recording was made over 11 years ago and with technology from that time in a dark smoky club with house lighting before you start. Once you have that in your mind you are given a real look back in time when Imelda was still Imelda Clabby and had no band and just arriving on the music scene in London.

How exciting is that?

As someone who would die to see the Beatles before they were recording, you know, back in Hamburg and even a set from The Cellar, I can feel the value of this treasure. Add to that the fact that she is playing with some of the top Rockabilly artists from that time which included Boz Boorer (from Morrisey) and Jeff Mead (plays with tons of bands) you understand you have a treasure that seems impossible to even exist!

I play this all the time and from this DVD my wife now listens to anything she releases. Good going on this one.

This is a DVD really for fans that want to see this talent when it was first arriving - 4 years before her first recording contract! Amazing.",1304640000,6,1068,4.220588235294118
8426588,4,B004EA2DVQ,"You need to understand that this is early and roughly recorded material, but once past that, it is a facinating performance of a real talent on the rise.  It is really fun to see the formative years.",1302998400,5,199,4.378378378378378
8426589,3,B004EA2DVQ,"Imelda is a great singer. This shows her in a 1999 club setting with a set camera view.  No frills.  Video quality is poor, but worst of all, this dvd is only 35 minutes!  But she is worth listening to,  Try her cd.",1294790400,7,215,3.9302325581395348
