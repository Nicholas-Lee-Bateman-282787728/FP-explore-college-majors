5570104,5,B00BBEFD6K,We are looking forward to seeing all  four of the 3D movies we ordered.  We enjoy seeing the beauties of nature.,1387670400,,112,4.285714285714286
5570105,5,B00BBEFD6K,Excellent 3D footage. I have seen many 3D galapagos documentary but this exceeds evrything. amazing. Its from David Attenborough-- that's the guarantee  stamp.,1386979200,,159,5.913043478260869
5570106,1,B00BBEFD6K,no 3D effects at all. I usually don't return things but it's not 3D. Movie was not good either. :(,1386547200,5,98,3.95
5570107,2,B00BBEFD6K,The most dull 3D movie ever - a few nice pieces of videos of animas but mostly unmoving scenery photos.,1386288000,2,103,4.2
5570108,5,B00BBEFD6K,this 3d has very good out of screen effects and real good photography. i would recommend this 3d. it is one i  can watch more than one time.,1385251200,2,140,4.0
5570109,2,B00BBEFD6K,"Not very good,better than the amazon one ,but anything would be better than that,3d is not very good and I have a good TV",1383868800,,121,4.083333333333333
5570110,2,B00BBEFD6K,"Galapagos 3D, Africa 3D, Amazon 3D, Papua 3D. All, apparently, by the same company; they are all horrible. Stultifyingly boring video (although with nice 3D, especially the underwater footage in this title) together with bad narration and music. Kind of like the video equivalent of ambient music (and I don't mean Brian Eno; I mean Muzak). Good for insomnia. NOT like a BBC production (e.g. Life, Planet Earth; THOSE should be released in 3D, but alas they were not shot with 3D cameras). Very low budget/ rushed feel to it. I gave an extra star for the price, but if you're expecting a quality, informative nature video then you will be disappointed.",1383177600,11,652,4.830357142857143
5570111,5,B00BBEFD6K,"I have ordered this movie long time ago, needed to wait unfortunately very long for this release !
I have seen many Galapagos movies before, but this was till now the best I have ever seen of the Galapagos islands .
Many animals in real 3D, amazing locations !
Definitely worth to buy this footage on BD .",1382486400,2,305,4.275862068965517
5570112,5,B00BBEFD6K,"excellent product as described on this page, highly recommended, really fast if the occasion volvere to buy with you thank you very much for everything",1405987200,,151,5.08
5570113,4,B00BBEFD6K,"Very nice imagery.

Was tranquil to watch.

Many interesting creatures.

Nature films are a great medium for 3D Blue Rays",1400889600,,121,4.95
5570114,5,B00BBEFD6K,"Item just as described, I have nothing bad to say about it since it follows the book and does a good job",1400112000,,104,3.772727272727273
5570115,1,B00BBEFD6K,"I thought it would be nice to have a few nature films in my 3D collection and this seemed like a good one. The narrator is so monotone and boring that he made watching a snoozfest. There is some 3D but it is not eye-popping. This is the type of film to show if you want people not to buy 3D. Good editing and story telliong with a strong narrator could have saved this, but I recommend for everyone to avoid.",1396656000,4,408,4.049382716049383
5570116,2,B00BBEFD6K,There quite a few animals in 3D than on the other 3D movies I purchased I will read the rest of the reviews for my next purchase!,1394755200,2,129,3.814814814814815
5570117,5,B00BBEFD6K,I bought two of these one for me and one for a gift and we were both real happy with the movie and the trans action as a whole thank you again,1391817600,,142,3.46875
5570118,1,B00BBEFD6K,Was not a 3D production as represented. Would not have bought it. Can i return it to Amazon? I hope so.,1390953600,2,103,3.9523809523809526
5570119,4,B00BBEFD6K,I was impressed with the qualty of this travelogue 3D BD..  Everyone to whom I've shown it were astonished and amazed at how good passive 3D is when the media was originally sourced with 3D equipment.,1390262400,,200,4.555555555555555
5570120,5,B00BBEFD6K,"After getting a 4k 3D TV, I bought several videos to try out.  This is the one that I always use as the demo when friends come over and want to check out the new TV.  The underwater scenes are especially impressive.  At one point my sister was headed for the closet to get a mop!  The resolution is wonderful.  You can see every scale on the iguanas and every feather on the birds.",1389139200,,381,4.094594594594595
5570121,2,B00BBEFD6K,I was very happy to receive my ordered movie so quickly. So understand me when I make my statement. The product itself was a very big disappoint because I looked forward to learning about the Galapagos Islands. What I found though was so boring and bland that those two things were enough to make me want to turn it off. What really pushed me over the edge was how bad the 3D actually was! Very little depth and absolutely no pop-out!!! I would warn anybody to be wary of anything produced by 3D Media. Just plain awful!!,1387843200,8,521,4.381443298969073

8565324,3,B00BBEFD6K,"Yes, this movie shows Galapagos, and yes, it's in 3D, but it's a rather simplistic and low budged production. It definitely pales in comparison with ""Galapagos 3D"" by BBC (with David Attenborough).",1436313600,,197,5.1875
