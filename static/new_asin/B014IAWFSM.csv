7413635,3,B014IAWFSM,"The content of this TCM ""That's Entertainment"" set is as wonderful as I remembered, but for some reason, my set's Disc 1 and Disc 2 are identical in the material they contain.  I don't know what, if anything, is missing overall, and the seller couldn't exchange my set.  I'll check the comments now and then to see if anyone can explain this seeming error ~ I'd like to know if I'm overlooking something.",1480982400,5,404,4.52054794520548

7413639,4,B014IAWFSM,"It is excellent value for money and quickly delivered, considering that I live in the UK! There is a fault of freezing on part 3 and on both sides, but I didn't want to put us all to the trouble of getting it replaced, because the value is already so agreeable, even with this glitch! So I have ordered part 3 from Amazon, UK. and none of this detracts from the excellence of Amazon, I hope and on both sides of this huge pond that separates us in body, but not in spirit!",1476403200,5,472,4.086021505376344

7413643,4,B014IAWFSM,I like having all disc in one case. The only thing is that the cd's are confusing. Disc two should fellow disc one and it's not. You have a disc between them. Don't know if disc one and disc two and three are on the same disc.,1473984000,3,226,3.8297872340425534

8730834,1,B014IAWFSM,"This was to be a gift for my grandmother but after reading other reviews that not all the discs worked I opened it to test them. First movie is fine. 2nd & 3rd movie discs are flawed. They don't have titles, the A side won't play at all, the B side intro didn't play and the movie skipped and froze every few minutes until freezing entirely. I didn't try 4th disc. What a ripoff. I could have bought the 1st movie by itself for much cheaper than this compilation that didn't work.",1509840000,2,480,4.228260869565218

8730838,5,B014IAWFSM,"Great set. I dislike that two of the discs aren't labeled so they can be easily found, but for the price and quality, they can't be beat. Everyone should see some of these movies at least once.  They show amazing acts beautifully .",1497571200,,231,4.372093023255814
