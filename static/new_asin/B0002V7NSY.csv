8032478,4,B0002V7NSY,An in depth look at the man and his genius. Very entertaining and informative.  One of the best biographies available.,1401580800,,118,4.9
8032479,5,B0002V7NSY,"Full disclosure: I am the editor of this film for Perpetual Motion Films & A&E

I believe this to be an exceptionally fine A&E Biography.  I worked on 10 Biographies, and of the ones I worked on, this is my favorite. It covers Michelangelo's life and work, and is nicely balanced.  There are only a few on-camera interviews, though.  Most of the story is told by the excellent narration.  The warm and supportive musical score was provided by film composer Rolfe Kent, and the photography of modern Italy and some of Michelangelo's works is exceptional.",1399334400,2,553,4.778947368421052
8032480,5,B0002V7NSY,This maybe an old film but I received a lot of information from it and will enjoy watching it over again. I purchase art films more than any other type of DVD. This biography is worth the purchase price.,1370908800,,203,4.230769230769231
8032481,5,B0002V7NSY,"I 've seen works of art by Michelangelo all of my life and still marvel at the statue of David every time I see it, but I never fully appreciated the artist's amazing talents until I saw this video.

I am glad Biography does not shy away from revealing Michelangelo's tormented personal life and his eternal struggle to reconcile his homosexual passions with his religious beliefs...passions  and pain which undoubtedly inspired his greatest works!",1359936000,2,448,5.04054054054054
8032482,3,B0002V7NSY,A&E does a fine job covering the important aspects of an unfathomable subject. There needs to be a piece on Michelangelo and a separate piece on his art. Such brilliance cannot be contained in one volume.,1202428800,2,204,4.694444444444445
8032483,5,B0002V7NSY,"A well scripted CD on the life of Michelangelo.  It is not only valuable for the student of the arts, but for anyone desiring to appreciate antiquity.  I could almost experience his pain when he painted the ceiling of the chapel.  It was a great overview of his life.  KL",1201392000,2,271,4.36
