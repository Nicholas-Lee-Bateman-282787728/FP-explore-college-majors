8706642,5,B00UGQ1UWU,"Brian Helgelands A Knights Tale adapts the story from Geoffrey Chaucers 614-year-old collection, The Canterbury Tales. The story focuses on a peasant, named William (Heath Ledger), who poses as a knight in order to compete and prove that a man may change his stars. In a fun example of art imitating life, William meets Chaucer (Paul Bettany), thereby setting this story as the origin of Chaucers later writing. Rounding out Williams company are Mark Addy as Roland, Alan Tudyk as Wat, and Laura Fraser as Kate. Rufus Sewell plays the primary antagonist, Count Adhemar, in a great bit of villainy as he competes against William not just for tournament wins, but for the affection of Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon).

Many critics panned the film for its anachronisms, including classic rock music, but Helgeland wisely chose to portray jousting and the tournaments that hosted it in the language of modern sports films, complete with an underdog, training montages, and the team helping the hero achieve personal growth. Helgeland set the film during a six-month period in the 1370s in which Chaucer had gone missing, with this story filling in the gaps in the historical record. For example, the film Chaucer threatens to eviscerate two men in fiction who appear to be the Pardoner and Summoner of The Canterbury Tales, while Jocelyns request that William first lose and then win draws upon an example from Arthurian legend.

The performances are excellent, the story is fun, and the film tells an action comedy without over-relying on CGI like modern films of the same genre might do. A must-watch for those who can celebrate anachronism and want to occasionally have fun with their history!",1534896000,,1688,5.046594982078853
