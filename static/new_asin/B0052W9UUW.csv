4531790,4,B0052W9UUW,"For over 400 years, it has been up to the clan of Kekkaishi, barrier masters, along with their supernatural dogs, to guard the region called Karasumori and exterminate powerful supernatural creatures, Ayakashi, that appear every night. Karasumori School just happens to be setting on that supernatural land.

Yoshimori Sumimura is an overconfident and determined 14- year old boy who attends Karasumori School. He's also the 22nd Kekkaishi of the Sumimura clan and is trained by his strict and short-tempered grandfather. Yoshimori is always competing against his older rival and crush, Tokine Yukimura. She is also a Kekkaishi, and a strict and hard-working one at that. She's known Yoshimori since childhood and even lives next door to him with her smug grandmother. Both Kekkaishi, especially their grandparents, are constantly arguing about who is the rightful heir as a barrier master.

Yoshimori's goal is to continue to work hard to become the best so he can protect the ones he cares about. But it won't be easy. The most extremely powerful Ayakashi are showing up on the Karasumori site with an evil goal in mind. Yoshimori and Tokine can't defeat them alone and have to get help from Yoshimori's older brother, Masamori, the Chief of the Night Troops. This group is an interesting bunch with unique, but burdensome powers of their own. But having the Night Troops around also causes some problems with the Kekkaishi. Will they ever learn to get along?

This is an entertaining and exciting anime. The show gets better with each episode. There are many likable characters in this interesting and creative story. There are great magical, action-packed fighting scenes, along with dramatic twists and turns and surprises as well as lots of comedy. It's a great show that will keep viewers watching. (52 episodes all together in the 4 DVD sets)",1389657600,,1850,5.078947368421052
4531791,5,B0052W9UUW,"I was pretty surprised with how much i liked this set. I was kind of expecting the quality to be ""eh"", but the picture was very clear, especially for dvd, and the sound is crisp. The only real complaints that can be given are as follows:
1. I don't enjoy the subtitle style they use for translating kanji on screen. I feel like it takes up too much space and lacks grace.
2. I feel like it could have come with more paper content inside. I know this is a common complaint, but I really enjoy opening a disc set and reading the literature.

Aside from that, as said above i really like this set. The discs aren't stacked on top of each other(which i detest)- they're mounted on ""pages"" and connected to the case with little swing arms. As is the style lately it is a pretty thin set. If you're a fan of the series this is a pretty good deal.",1387152000,,840,4.153374233128834

4531794,4,B0052W9UUW,"This set doesn't move as quickly as the others, but the main arc finally starts to unravel. You are also introduced to more characters, which makes things more complex and interesting as the story develops.",1370217600,,206,4.914285714285715

4531796,5,B0052W9UUW,"After defending the sacred site for years, Yoshimori still knows next to nothing about it. Yoshimori's brother, Masamori shows up on some sort of secret mission. He seems to be tracking a devious and tricky Ayakashi. After his brothers visit, Yoshimori decides that he's going to find a way to seal the site for good. Just when he makes that decision, new enemies appear. The new enemies are Ayakashi wearing human skin. This new enemy is dangerous and powerful. Luckily, Masamori has sent one of his subordinates to back up Yoshimori and Tokine. This new ally's name is Gen. He harbors an Ayakashi inside his body; which gives him great physical strength. But the true enemy is on the move. They are preparing for an all out assault on the sacred ground.

The series improves quite a bit in this volume. The characters gain more depth, and new ones are added. The identity of the enemy is revealed, and the plot begins to thicken. Much of the groundwork for the series is laid in set 2. I think it's a lot better than volume 1. Even though the action and mystery picks up a lot in this volume, the whimsical comedy and light hearted mood that we've become used to is still in tact.

The drama between Tokine and Yoshimori also deepens in part 2. Yoshimori's feelings for her seem to grow stronger and he becomes more protective. This makes him seem more mature, and immature at the same time. Tokine seems to realize that he's maturing and trying to protect her, but she still treats him very coldly. Even though the series changes a lot, it remains essentially the same if that makes any sense. I think that if you enjoyed set 1, you'll like this one even more. I really enjoy this series. I think that most anime fans can find something here to love as well.",1357516800,,1761,4.517241379310345

This show is definitely worth Owning.

Overall Rating 4/5
The Kekkaishi are spiritual warriors, kind of like Buddhist monk fighters.  They use special barriers, Kekkai, to trap and destroy ayakashi.  They are spiritual creatures from Japanese folklore.  These creatures aren't supposed to interact with the human world and cause damage, so the Kekkaishi vanquish them.

Its an interesting action show that starts with two completing/cooperating Kekkaishi families as young kids, skips some years, and then after a few episodes or so gets to mid-teens somewhere for the rest of the show.  The leads Yoshimori and Tokine butt heads sometimes but find unique ways to beat strong enemies as the hone their skills throughout the show.  Its a bit unique and worth the watch.

Theme Songs 3/5
The show has a solid well-fitting opening. The endings eventually cycle between a few.  They were okay.

Ending 3/5
NO spoilers, the end completed a big story arc.  It left things as basically as now lets keep on keepin on. It was fine.",1527552000,,1092,4.9779005524861875
