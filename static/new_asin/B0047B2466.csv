8417894,5,B0047B2466,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is, of course, enjoying a revival due to the passing of Ms. Debbie Reynolds, its great star, but don't pass up this classic as a great date-night flick choice or just to share the heyday of Hollywood with your family.  This film more than earns its status as one of Hollywood's greatest musicals, from the golden era of the old studio system when musical productions earned their epic status with fabulous production values, elegant costumes, incredible dancing and, of course, their classic tunes.

Gene Kelly, already a legend, protested Debbie's casting because of her inexperience.  She got the role partly due to the influence of Lillian Burns, MGM's ""training expert"", who took studio prodigies under her wing for special instruction in voice, acting, presentation and etiquette as well as dance.  Debbie later recounted the tale of one particularly trying day, when Kelly's criticism, her feet bleeding from dozens of takes and her own self-doubt drove her to seek refuge under one of the studio's pianos in tears.  Another of MGM's stars looked underneath and asked why she was crying. When she explained, he led her to the soundstage where he was working on another production to show her how much work he, the great Fred Astaire, had to do.  She returned to work with greater confidence, and the result is history.

Some of the production numbers may seem overlong to modern audiences more accustomed to a 2-3 minute hoofing, but they're not to be missed.  The meticulous choreography is well executed by Kelly, Cyd Charisse and Donald O'Connor, and of course Debbie Reynolds' efforts, which are all the more admirable when one considers that she had had no dance instruction prior to her contract with MGM.  The plot is more believable than so many of today's movie musicals, which often require a viewer to suspend all common sense.

""Singin' in the Rain"" is an ageless classic that everyone can enjoy for decades to come.",1485648000,,1956,4.935975609756097

SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) is a pure delight!
All of its songs were composed by that prolific team of Arthur Freed and Nacio Brown, and not just the few sung by the main characters. There's references here to dozens of familiar tunes written by these talented men back in the 1920s and '30s.

Kudos to Jean Hagen, who is simply remarkable as the always repulsive, forever screechy Lina Lamont. The character is based on Norma and Constance Talmadge-- Their star-rank careers came to a sudden end with the advent of talkies because both had heavy Brooklyn accents and unpleasant voices.

A description here of the movie's most famous sequence, ""Broadway Melody.""

In this extended number, the new-to-New York Gene Kelly enters briskly from stage left. He wears a straw hat, striped jacket and black frame glasses and carries a valise as he gaily calls out the opening phrase, ""Gotta dance!"" Kelly is then ushered into a fast-paced NY world. He quickly rises from burlesque clown to baggy pants vaudevillian to a tuxedoed gent in the Ziegfeld Follies.

Kelly becomes infatuated with the beautiful girlfriend of a gangster (Cyd Charisse in a stunning green gown) and the two perform an elegant fantasy ballet. From here it's all downhill. The small town boy ends up as he started: on the street. Although now clad in a fine suit of evening clothes, the enthusiasm is gone-- he looks mournful.

At that moment, another new arrival strides rapidly from stage left. He's dressed just as Gene was when he came to Broadway and he sings out the same ""Gotta dance!"" Gene's spirits revive. He happily calls back and the production ends on a high note.

The entire story is most entertaining and like all great films, it holds up well. The above sequence is nothing less than stunning and if you've never seen it before, you are in for the rarest of treats. Highest recommendation to Comden & Green's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN!

The ""American in Paris"" suite from the 1951 Gene Kelly/MGM musical of the same name may just be the most beautiful ever committed to film. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD-edition/dp/B001BHI0JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD edition</a>)
