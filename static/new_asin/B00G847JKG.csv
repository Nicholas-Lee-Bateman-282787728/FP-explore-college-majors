8621360,5,B00G847JKG,"This is an awesome video. It is a step by step instructional video on the forehand loop. The video is progressive in its instructions; so you master each level before you move on to the next.  This is good for those just beginning to learn the loop. It teaches you how to loop against top spin and back spin and shows you the proper form and swing necessary to achieve the shot.  The video covers slow loops and the loop drive.  It shows you how to produce a lot of spin. The commentator is clear and the coach demonstrations are easy to follow. More advanced looping is taught at the end for those who want to improve an already effective loop. This video is good for players of all levels and will certainly improve your game.
I highly recommend this video. I am an intermediate club player and I own many instructional videos on table tennis. This one ranks among the best.",1384905600,,876,4.395061728395062
