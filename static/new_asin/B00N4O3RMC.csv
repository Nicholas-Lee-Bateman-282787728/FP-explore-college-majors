8676233,4,B00N4O3RMC,"Kim Jaejoong, was the best part of this drama.  This drama had a good story line with good actors, and it had so much potential.  Unfortunately, the  writer didn't know what to do with any of the actors, so they mostly sat around.  If Jaejoong weren't in Triangle, I wouldn't have watched it.  Kim Bum Soo, was also good, but he gave up half way through the drama.",1457654400,,364,4.294117647058823
